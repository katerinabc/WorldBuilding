]\r\n\r\n\r\nDonnie clenched his small fists and tried not to cry, but two\r\nelliptical tears ran slowly down his cheeks. The sight of them made Mr.\r\nAmes even madder.\r\n\r\n"Look at him," he stormed, turning to Martha. "Just look at him. Every\r\ndamn time I try to reason with him, he starts to snivel like an animal,\r\ninstead of acting like a normal human being." Mr. Ames flicked his\r\ncigar ashes toward a vacuum cup on the wall and looked down at the boy.\r\n"Now stop that stupid crying and tell me what this is all about."\r\n\r\nDonnie sniffled a couple of times and wiped his nose on the back of one\r\nof his blue uniform sleeves.\r\n\r\n"Well," Mr. Ames said, coldly.\r\n\r\nThe boy took a deep breath and raised his head. "I want you to spend\r\nsome time with me," he said. "I want you to--" he searched the elusive\r\nshadows of memory until he found the word he wanted--"I want you to\r\n_play_ with me. That\'s it. I want you to play with me once in a while."\r\n\r\nMr. Ames blinked his eyes and stepped back. "Play," he repeated. "What\r\ndo you mean _play_?"\r\n\r\nDonnie hesitated. "You know," he said, finally, "take me on long walks\r\nand sit down and play games and tell me stories once in a while."\r\n\r\n"But you\'ve got all the stories you need," Mr. Ames said, waving his\r\nhand at the banks of audiotapes stacked neatly on the wall shelves.\r\n"And your audio-prompter can tell them better than I can."\r\n\r\n"Yes," Donnie said, "but that\'s a machine and I want--"\r\n\r\n"What\'s wrong with a machine," Mr. Ames said, his face getting red.\r\n"Some of our best things come from machines. Didn\'t they teach you that\r\nat the Incubator?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," the boy said, "but isn\'t there anything besides machines? I\r\ncan\'t play with machines, I want to play with you!" He began to sob\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nMr. Ames dashed his cigar to the floor. "I give up," he said. "By the\r\nRed Balls of Jupiter, I give up!"\r\n\r\n"Now, Henry," his wife said. "Remember, the boy\'s only seven."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t \'Henry\' me," Mr. Ames said, "And besides, what does being seven\r\nhave to do with it. When I was his age, I was an honor student in\r\nphysics. _He_ can\'t even pass algebra."\r\n\r\nDonnie stared at the toes of his boots.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve given this kid everything," Mr. Ames went on. "He\'s going to\r\nthe best pre-nuclear school in the whole hemisphere. He\'s got his own\r\nrocket kit. Why, he\'s even been on a study cruise to the moon! How\r\nmany kids his age have been to the moon already? I bet no other kid in\r\nour project has been there. And what do I get as a reward." 

Mr. Ames\r\ndidn\'t wait for an answer. "Trouble. 

That\'s what I get, trouble. Why in\r\nGalaxy he can\'t leave me alone like a normal child is more than I can\r\nunderstand." He stopped for breath and lit a fresh cigar.\r\n\r\n"Maybe the boy\'s sick," Martha said timidly.\r\n\r\nMr. Ames ignored her. "I\'ve tried to be a good father to him," he said,\r\nhis voice self-righteous. "I\'m giving him a chance to make something\r\nout of himself. All I ask is that he be of service to the world, and\r\nmake me proud of him some day. But what does he do? Does he concentrate\r\non his career, like the rest of the kids? Hell, no, he wants to hang\r\naround me, always underfoot, always asking stupid questions. Play!" Mr.\r\nAmes snorted.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not just play."\r\n\r\n"Heh, what\'s that?" Mr. Ames jumped.\r\n\r\n"I said it\'s not just play," Donnie repeated, bravely brushing away\r\nhis tears. "You don\'t give me any--" he searched again for the right\r\nword--"any _companionship_. A boy needs companionship. Don\'t you\r\nunderstand?"\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t," Mr. Ames said. "And I\'m sure they didn\'t teach you\r\nthat in the Incubator either. Don\'t you realize you should be fully\r\ncoordinated by now. Instead, you want me to take time from my work--Why\r\nit\'s preposterous. It\'s, it\'s--unscientific!"\r\n\r\n"But, all I want--"\r\n\r\nMr. Ames held up his hand. "Enough of this," he said. "I refuse to\r\ndiscuss it anymore. Now go to your room and get ready for your study\r\nperiod."\r\n\r\nThe boy burst out crying again and ran out of the room.\r\n\r\nMr. Ames shook his head. "Definite neurotic tendencies," he muttered to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n"What dear?" his wife said.\r\n\r\n"Nothing, Martha," he answered. "Just talking to myself." He sat down\r\nheavily on the couch and sighed. What was wrong with Donnie, anyway?\r\nWhere did he get those archaic ideas from? Surely he had been taught\r\nthat the whole purpose of the incubator system was to speed up learning\r\nand growth processes so children wouldn\'t have to waste precious years\r\ngrowing up, like they did in the old days. Why their new technological\r\nage simply had no time to fool around with infantile desires. There\r\nwere too many things to do, too many knotty scientific problems to\r\nsolve. 

Emotions, Mr. Ames mumbled to himself, you never could trust\r\nyour damn emotions.\r\n\r\nThat night, after Donnie was in bed, Mr. Ames went to his study and\r\npulled out the boy\'s file. It explained what he was fitted for, what\r\nabilities he had inherited, and what his primary training included.\r\nMr. Ames noted sadly that the boy\'s Scientific Quotient was 142, well\r\nabove normal, and that he would stand six feet tall and weigh close to\r\n195 pounds when fully developed.\r\n\r\nMr. Ames, who was incubator-born himself, was completely sold on\r\nthe ingenious system the Federation of World Councils had devised.\r\nNo more hit-and-miss mass reproduction, where morons were gradually\r\nout-breeding intelligent beings, but instead, selective artificial\r\ninsemination through which only the best strains were permitted to\r\nreproduce. Each generation, the human race got healthier and smarter.\r\nInsanity and inherited diseases were a thing of the past and nature\'s\r\nprimitive law--only the fittest shall survive--was now a glittering\r\nreality. Why the Federated Incubators even took over the burden of\r\neducating the children for the first five years. Parents no longer\r\nhad to be bothered caring for helpless, bawling brats. By the time\r\nIncubates were placed on the available list, they were completely\r\nself-sufficient and emotionally conditioned to fit into any family\r\ngroup. Parents simply picked what they wanted. 

Mr. Ames, of course, had\r\nselected a future nuclear-chemist.\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful system, Mr. Ames told himself, and even more\r\nimportant, it worked. But somehow, some way, there was something\r\nradically wrong with their child.\r\n\r\n"Definite neurotic symptoms," Mr. Ames murmured, half aloud. 

By\r\nJupiter, there was only one thing to do. He shut the folder firmly and\r\nspun around to the trans-audio. A green light appeared on the panel\r\nalmost immediately.\r\n\r\n"Your connection, please?" the automon said.\r\n\r\n"Give me the local Incubator."\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, then a click. "Federated Health and Service,\r\ncoordinator speaking. May I help you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. 

This is Mr. Henry Ames, over at the Amarillo Group Project. I\r\nhave a complaint to make."\r\n\r\n"Yes?" The coordinator, a woman, was carefully polite.\r\n\r\n"It\'s about the child you sent us."\r\n\r\n"Specimen please?"\r\n\r\n"What? Oh, it\'s a boy, Class Triple A, breed, nuclear chemistry. We got\r\nhim about 18 months ago and--"\r\n\r\n"What is your number please?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s ... just a minute." 

Mr. Ames consulted the folder. "My number is\r\n34-72-oh-41. And we\'ve got a three-year guarantee," he added pointedly.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir. Just a minute sir." There was a whirring sound at the other\r\nend of the circuit. After a short wait, the coordinator\'s voice came\r\nthrough again.\r\n\r\n"Well, sir," she said. "You have the select model in our scientific\r\nline of seven-year-olds. According to our records, he checked out\r\nperfectly on all phases of learning and aptitude. Have you tried memory\r\nteaching?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'ve tried memory teaching. He learns fine." 

Mr. Ames stopped.\r\n"Look, you don\'t seem to understand. He\'s okay as far as performance\r\ngoes. He does everything we tell him and all that, but he\'s\r\nstill a real pain in the--I mean, he\'s developing very annoying\r\ncharacteristics."\r\n\r\n"Please go on, Mr. 

Ames." The coordinator\'s voice was warm and\r\nsympathetic. "How does he annoy you?"\r\n\r\n"Well, for one thing, he\'s getting pronounced possessive tendencies. He\r\nalmost seems to resent being left alone. Why, just this evening he told\r\nme he wants us to _play_ with him!"\r\n\r\n"Did you say _play_ with him?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s right," Mr. Ames said, triumphantly. "And he says he needs\r\ncompanionship, or something like that."\r\n\r\n"Companionship," the coordinator repeated. "Oh, dear. 

This is more\r\nserious than I thought. I\'m afraid you definitely have a reject,\r\nMr. Ames. If he shows these tendencies at this early age, then the\r\nsituation will be intolerable later on."\r\n\r\n"It\'s intolerable right now," Henry insisted. "Anyway, I thought you\r\npeople were supposed to clear up all this emotional unbalance in the\r\nprimary psych indoctrination."\r\n\r\n"We usually do," the coordinator agreed, "but every once in a while,\r\none slips through inspection with faulty communal-perception. The\r\none you\'ve got is obviously a throw-back." The coordinator coughed\r\napologetically. "It\'s really not the boy\'s fault, of course, but I\'m\r\nafraid we\'ll have to reclaim him."\r\n\r\n"The sooner the better," Mr. Ames said. "This mess is upsetting my work\r\nat the lab. When can I get a replacement?"\r\n\r\n"We\'ll send a new model over when we pick up the reject. Will tomorrow\r\nmorning be convenient?"\r\n\r\n"Sure. Fine. 

Just make sure this one is normal. You better check our\r\nphysio records too. I hear the people down the circle got one that\r\ndidn\'t look like them at all."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t worry," the coordinator assured him. "You\'ll get a boy you can\r\nbe proud of this time. Will there be anything more now?"\r\n\r\n"No, no, I guess not." An uneasy feeling slipped into Mr. Ames\'s\r\nconsciousness. "I just wondered," he said, suddenly. "What will happen\r\nto Don--I mean, the reject you sent us. Will he be--uh--destroyed?"\r\n\r\nThe coordinator laughed. 

"Heavens, no, Mr. Ames," she said, lightly.\r\n"He\'ll be sent to the Biological Reservation and allowed to live out\r\nhis life span with other rejects. He\'ll be much happier there. We\'re\r\nnot savages, you know."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right," Mr. Ames said, his tone matching her brightness. "We\'re\r\nnot savages. Well, we\'ll be expecting the new one tomorrow, and thanks\r\nfor all your trouble."\r\n\r\n"No trouble at all," the coordinator said, smoothly. 

"Feel free to call\r\non us any time."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK REJECT ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\xe2\x80\x99s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
