The body was covered with\r\na white sheet, except for the long, slim feet which were sticking out.\r\nHer toenails were painted red.\r\n\r\nForty-year-old John Bork listened while the prosecutor read the\r\nindictment against him: "--and the same John Bork did on the twelfth\r\nday of March, 1986, fire a pistol at his wife, having then and there a\r\nlong preconceived desire to kill her, and then and there did achieve\r\nhis felonious intent, and did murder the same Fannie Bork."\r\n\r\n"John Bork, you have heard the indictment," stated the judge formally.\r\n"How do you wish to plead: Not guilty, no contest, or wait and see?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll wait and see, your honor."\r\n\r\n"I thought you would," sighed the judge. "We haven\'t had a straight\r\nnot-guilty plea in ages. Proceed, Mr. 

Prosecutor."\r\n\r\n"Roll in the Very Complicated Monstrous Proximilator machine,"\r\ncommanded the prosecutor. Two burly laborers, panting, rolled the\r\nmachine on its creaky casters across the court room floor to Fannie\'s\r\nhead. The machine was six feet tall, three feet wide, and twelve inches\r\ndeep; on its face were forty-three meters and an on/off switch.\r\n\r\nThe laborers plugged the machine\'s line cord into an outlet and got out\r\nof the way.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe prosecutor flipped the switch from off to on. Then he folded his\r\narms and waited until all the forty-three meters ceased their dancing\r\nand went back to zero. That done, he turned to the jury.\r\n\r\n"In this machine rests the proof of the crime charged against the\r\ndefendant," he said dramatically, patting the smooth gray side of the\r\nmachine. "This machine will tell you _all_ you need to know about the\r\nmurder. Oh, to be sure, I shall show you the corpus delicti presently;\r\nbut _why_ and _how_ this crime was committed shall be revealed only by\r\nthis machine\'s stimulation of the deceased\'s brain. _She will herself\r\nrelate who her killer was!_"\r\n\r\nThere was a shocked gasp from the jurors and the spectators in the\r\ncourt room when the prosecutor pulled back the sheet from the body,\r\nuncovering her head and chest. "The jury will note that the government\r\nhas removed her skull down to her eyebrows so that we could contact her\r\nbrain\'s recordings with the machine\'s probe. The jury will also note\r\nthe four bullet holes in the deceased\'s chest, which we intend to prove\r\nwere put there by John Bork."\r\n\r\n"I missed twice," said John Bork, nodding.\r\n\r\n"Silence!" shouted the suddenly enraged judge. "This court depends\r\nentirely on the Very Complicated Monstrous Proximilator machine for\r\nits evidence." He turned to the jury, still seething. "The jury will\r\ncompletely disregard the defendant\'s utterly uncalled-for admission.\r\nProceed, Mr. Prosecutor."\r\n\r\nThe prosecutor fastened the ground cable of the machine to Fannie\'s big\r\ntoe by means of an immense alligator clamp. Then taking the bulbous\r\nradio-frequency probe in his hand he said portentously, "Now we shall\r\nsearch for the memory-recording of Fannie Bork\'s moment of death!"\r\n\r\nHe touched her brain lightly with the probe.\r\n\r\nThose seeing it for the first time were chilled by the dead body\'s\r\nsudden animation.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Winston!" cooed dead Fannie Bork, her aims raising from the cot to\r\nembrace an invisible something. She kissed. 

"You tastes good!"\r\n\r\nThe prosecutor moved the probe.\r\n\r\n"George?" called Fannie, her slim arms searching at the side of her\r\ncot. "I didn\'t hear you leave, George." She relaxed. 

"Oh, I hope he\r\nfound his shoes."\r\n\r\n"He didn\'t though," contributed John Bork.\r\n\r\nThe prosecutor moved the probe, hurrying on by emotion-stirred quavers:\r\nAngelo, Moose, Maudie, Deacon and Quasimodo.\r\n\r\n"Speed, darlin\', what\'s your _hurry_?" asked Fannie in her plaintive,\r\nmetallic voice as she held out her hands beseechingly.\r\n\r\n"I never got to know him very well," interjected John Bork. "His visits\r\nwere all so short."\r\n\r\nThe prosecutor moved his probe.\r\n\r\n"Bork! Bork!"\r\n\r\n"Ah," said the prosecutor. "Now we are getting down to cases. I shall\r\ntry that spot again."\r\n\r\n"Bork! Bork!"\r\n\r\n"She\'s not calling for me," advised Bork. "She just had a cold that\r\nweek."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe prosecutor moved his probe. At each touch, the body broke into\r\nquaking action: Ferdinand, Frenchy, Yacob; Peyton, Rebel, Young foo\r\nYum; and John.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said the prosecutor. "Here we are now."\r\n\r\n"John!" whispered Fannie. "John, John, John! Oh, Johnny Johnson, my\r\nlove! 

_Stay_ here forever!"\r\n\r\n"Wife\'s other John," said John Bork succinctly.\r\n\r\nThe prosecutor moved his probe: Sinclair, Henrik, Sitting Duck, Oscar,\r\nKenny, and Aqueduct.\r\n\r\n"That Aqueduct is Sitting Duck\'s educated brother," confided John Bork.\r\n"Before he went to Princeton his name was Wet Duck."\r\n\r\nThe prosecutor moved his probe: Pease, Reese and Meese, Acuff, Eyolf\r\nand Beowulf; Bork! Bork!\r\n\r\n"That cough again?" muttered the prosecutor, ready to move on.\r\n\r\n"No, she\'s calling for me that time," corrected Bork.\r\n\r\n"How can you tell?"\r\n\r\n"It has more of a snarl in it than her cough has."\r\n\r\nThe prosecutor tried the spot once more.\r\n\r\n"Bork! Bork! Why are you pointing that at me, Bork? What are you going\r\nto _do_, Bork?" She held out her hands to ward him off. "Oh! 

Oh! 

Oh!\r\nOh!" Then she dropped her hands.\r\n\r\n"I missed twice," John said, nodding.\r\n\r\n"The defendant will keep his lousy confessions to himself!" shrieked\r\nthe judge. "I will not have the importance of our Very Complicated\r\nMonstrous Proximilator machine vitiated by these unwanted confessions!"\r\n\r\nBork shrugged. 

"I just wanted to clear up a couple of details, your\r\nhonor. 

I just like to be tidy."\r\n\r\n"We don\'t _need_ your help," responded the judge crushingly. "The Very\r\nComplicated Monstrous Proximilator machine tells us _all_ we want to\r\nknow." He turned to the prosecutor. 

"You may proceed."\r\n\r\n"The state rests."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBork\'s lawyer advised the court that no defense would be presented.\r\nThe prosecutor exhorted the jury that its duty was plain. The judge\r\ngave final instructions, and the jury filed out. It returned in four\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict in such a\r\ngratifyingly short space of time?" the judge asked, beaming.\r\n\r\nThe foreman arose. "We have, your honor."\r\n\r\n"Just for the record, what is your verdict?" twinkled the judge.\r\n\r\n"Not guilty, your honor."\r\n\r\nThe prosecutor jumped up. "Why, that can\'t be!" 

he shouted. "It\'s a\r\n_prima facie_ case, unrefuted and therefore patent. What else do you\r\n_need_?"\r\n\r\n"Yeah!" agreed the judge, outraged.\r\n\r\n"We need some plain, old-fashioned evidence of a crime," answered the\r\njuryman, unperturbed.\r\n\r\n"Old-fashioned?" The fuming prosecutor rejected the heresy, pushing\r\nit away from him with both hands. "This is all unscientific\r\nnow," he warned. "The Very Complicated Monstrous Proximilator\r\nmachine--especially the new model with the forty-three meters which\r\nreplaces the old thirty-nine meter machine--is the _ne plus ultra_ of\r\njustice!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, it isn\'t," dissented the foreman. "Did your evidence place\r\nthe deadly weapon in the defendant\'s hand? Did your evidence even tend\r\nto show the holes in the woman\'s chest were _made_ by a gun? She said\r\nnothing about a weapon, if you will recall. She merely said, \'Why are\r\nyou pointing that at me, Bork? What are you going to do, Bork?\'"\r\n\r\n"But he had plenty of motive," pleaded the prosecutor.\r\n\r\n"Oh, we\'ll go along with _that_," assented the foreman.\r\n\r\n"And the defendant admitted it!" pursued the prosecutor triumphantly.\r\n\r\nThe foreman shook his head. "Admissions don\'t count. The judge said so\r\nhimself."\r\n\r\n"So even though you know he\'s guilty," the prosecutor said hollowly,\r\n"you\'re going to let him go?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s right," agreed the foreman happily, and cleared his throat.\r\n"We, the jury," he pronounced, "find this fellow innocent of what he\r\ndid!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE HAPPY HOMICIDE ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
