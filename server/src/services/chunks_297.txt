But why did\r\n            they keep insisting they were innocent before--\r\n\r\n                            The Inquisitor\r\n\r\n                          By Randall Garrett\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Imagination Stories of Science and Fantasy\r\n                             December 1956\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Conway Kroll reached his office that morning, there were three\r\nprisoners waiting to be interrogated. He smiled coldly at the sight of\r\nthem, standing in the large bare room awaiting their fate.\r\n\r\n"Good morning," he said, with steely politeness. "My name is Kroll.\r\nIt is my job to conduct the interrogation to which you three will be\r\nsubjected today."\r\n\r\nOne of the three--a tall, youthful-looking man--glared up at him\r\nbitterly. "Interrogation? _Torture_, you mean!"\r\n\r\nKroll brought his eyes to rest on the man who had spoken slowly, almost\r\nscornfully. "You have the wrong idea completely, my friend. It is\r\nnecessary to persuade you to divulge certain facts. The State requires\r\nit of you. If you refuse--" He gestured sadly--"we must compel you.\r\nBut you are all so determined to make things hard for us. I don\'t\r\n_want_ to hurt you, you know."\r\n\r\n"But you _will_ hurt us," said another of the prisoners. She was a\r\ngirl, no more than twenty, slim and darkhaired. Even in the dreary\r\nprison garb, thought Kroll, she retained her beauty. "You\'re going to\r\ntorture us!"\r\n\r\nKroll shrugged: "I repeat: I don\'t want to."\r\n\r\nHe looked at his watch. "Come; we are wasting time, and the Inquisitor\r\nis waiting. Miss Horniman, you must be first."\r\n\r\nThe girl shrank back behind the bitter-eyed young man. The third\r\nprisoner, a resigned-looking, balding man of fifty or so, did not\r\nchange his expression.\r\n\r\n"Take me first," the man said. "Leave her alone.

"\r\n\r\nAgain Kroll shrugged. "The Inquisitor would like Miss Horniman first,\r\nMr. Leslie. 

This is the preferred order, and this is the order that\r\nwill be."\r\n\r\nA guard stepped forward and shoved the sobbing girl up and ahead,\r\ntoward the door. The man named Leslie clashed his manacles impotently\r\ntogether and spat. "Butchers! Torturers!"\r\n\r\n"Please, Mr. Leslie," Kroll said gently, a pained expression on his\r\nface. "You make our job even harder than it is."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe followed the girl into the adjoining room, where the Inquisitor was\r\nwaiting. The Interrogation Chamber was an immense rectangular room with\r\nconcrete floor and bleak white walls, in the center of which stood the\r\nInquisitor.\r\n\r\n"Good morning, Kroll," the Inquisitor said. Its metallic voice rattled\r\nand boomed in the big room. In the depths of the machine, relays\r\nclicked and hummed. Kroll bowed to it, and the Inquisitor responded\r\nwith a gesture of a prolonged metal arm. "The first prisoner, Kroll."\r\n\r\n"Miss Florence Horniman," Kroll said. "Accused of treason against the\r\nState. Denies charge.

"\r\n\r\n"How do you plead?" the machine asked coldly.\r\n\r\n"Not guilty," stammered the girl.\r\n\r\nTwo huge metal arms extended from the Inquisitor\'s sides and folded\r\naround her. They drew her across the room to the bosom of the robot.\r\n"Feed in the data, Kroll."\r\n\r\nAt the signal, Kroll slipped in the tape on the girl. A moment passed\r\nwhile the Inquisitor digested the data, and then: "The plea of not\r\nguilty is rejected as invalid."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t just do that!" 

the girl said. 

"That\'s my plea!"\r\n\r\n"Not valid in view of the evidence," said the Inquisitor. Kroll smiled\r\ndistantly. He had seen this scene repeated, over and over, almost\r\nevery day for the ten years he had held the post. He wrapped his\r\nblue-and-gold Interrogator\'s cloak around himself impressively and\r\nstepped forward.\r\n\r\n"You are accused of treason against the State," Kroll said sonorously.\r\n"But it is my duty to inform you that your sentence may be mitigated\r\nupon your delivering us certain information--about leaders of your\r\nmovement, future plans, location of your party cell, and so forth."\r\n\r\nFlorence Horniman\'s eyes flashed brightly. "I won\'t tell you anything!"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I did not make myself clear," Kroll said. He repeated his\r\noffer.\r\n\r\n"The answer is still no!"\r\n\r\nKroll sighed. 

"Very well," he said. A third hand slid from the\r\nInquisitor\'s body and a needle-thin finger traced a line down the\r\ngirl\'s bare arm. A bloody trickle appeared.\r\n\r\nShe began to sob again. Kroll stepped closer and lifted her head. "Why\r\nmust you hold out?" he asked. "Why don\'t you speak?

"\r\n\r\nStill silence. The finger rose again and sliced lightly across her\r\ncheek.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"All right, take her away," Kroll said when twenty minutes had passed.\r\nThe Inquisitor was humming merrily, busily taping the data that had\r\nbeen extracted from the girl and feeding it to the main computers\r\ndownstairs. They would integrate it and notify the State Police. It was\r\na smooth-functioning system.\r\n\r\nThe bloody thing that had been Florence Horniman was led away by\r\na guard, and the next prisoner led in. It was the middle-aged man,\r\nChester Wengrove.\r\n\r\n"Get your hands off me," he snapped to the guard as he was shoved into\r\nthe room. "You have no right to--"\r\n\r\n"Unfortunately, as a representative of the State he has every right,"\r\nKroll said calmly. He fed Wengrove\'s tape to the Inquisitor. The trial\r\nproceeded.\r\n\r\nWengrove was stubborn; it took half an hour to break him down at all,\r\nbut when he did speak he sang freely, giving data on his cell of the\r\nMovement.\r\n\r\n"Very good," the Inquisitor said when Wengrove finally coughed and said\r\nhe knew no more. "You are completely exonerated from the charge of\r\ntreason, in view of the information you have given."\r\n\r\nThe eyes in the bloody face lit up. "I\'m free, you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Unfortunately, no," the Inquisitor said. "Because of your danger\r\nto the State, you must be kept in Quarantine Camp, along with other\r\ndiseased former members of society, until such time as we are able to\r\nclear your mind of its confusion. But you will not be punished."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t be punished?" Wengrove repeated mindlessly.\r\n\r\n"When the Inquisitor says something, it means it," Kroll said. "Take\r\nhim away."\r\n\r\nThe next prisoner was Neil Leslie. He strode into the Inquisitor\'s\r\nChamber without having to be pushed, and confronted Kroll defiantly.\r\n"My turn, eh?"\r\n\r\nKroll nodded. "Your companions have both been removed." He nodded\r\nmeaningful toward the Inquisitor, whose claws were red with the blood\r\nof Florence Horniman and Chester Wengrove. "They both spoke most\r\nsatisfactorily----after some persuasion.

"\r\n\r\n"Torture, you mean."\r\n\r\n"We\'ve been through this already," Kroll said. "Since you\'re going to\r\ntalk anyway, I don\'t understand why you can\'t save yourself a great\r\ndeal of pain by talking now, before I hand you to the Inquisitor."\r\n\r\n"Because I don\'t mean to talk at all," Leslie said. He ran a hand\r\nthrough his shock of blonde hair and glared fiercely at Kroll.\r\n\r\n"Very well," the Interrogator said. He stepped to the robot and slipped\r\nin Neil Leslie\'s tape.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"I don\'t understand you at all," Kroll admitted, looking down at the\r\npain-racked body before him. "Why don\'t you talk? 

I don\'t _want_ to\r\nkeep you in here, you know."\r\n\r\nBloodshot eyes looked back at him, eyes clouded with pain and hatred.\r\n"I\'m not saying anything," Leslie murmured. "Oil up your robot and\r\nlet\'s try again."\r\n\r\nFor the hundredth time the Inquisitor\'s talons descended, raked a red\r\nline across the man\'s body. He shuddered, but did not speak. Kroll\r\nshook his head impatiently. No prisoner had ever held out against the\r\nInquisitor this long before. He found himself perspiring.\r\n\r\nThe Inquisitor said, "The name of your leader is David Cosbro. Is this\r\ntrue?"\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\nA needle descended.\r\n\r\nStill no answer.\r\n\r\n"Your Cell was located in East Appalachia. Upper Quadrant. 

Is this\r\ntrue?"\r\n\r\nNo answer again.\r\n\r\nMinutes passed, minutes in which Leslie continued to stare defiantly\r\noutward, continued to clench his fists and remain silent.\r\n\r\nFinally the Inquisitor opened its tightly-clamped arms and let Leslie\r\nstagger out. He slumped to the ground at the feet of the robot and\r\nleaned dazedly against the Inquisitor\'s gleaming base.\r\n\r\n"Prisoner is on the verge of death," the Inquisitor said. "Further\r\nquestioning is pointless."\r\n\r\nKroll looked down in surprise and chagrin. In ten years, this was the\r\nfirst time a prisoner had not broken under Interrogation. He scowled\r\nangrily; it was his first failure.\r\n\r\n"You\'re a stubborn man, Leslie. But it\'s killed you."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not dead yet," the prisoner said brokenly. Suddenly he mustered\r\nsome strength and managed to look up. "Tell me something, Kroll. I want\r\nto know something."\r\n\r\n"Yes?"\r\n\r\n"Why do you do what you do?"\r\n\r\n"You mean--Interrogate?"\r\n\r\n"I mean torture," Leslie said.\r\n\r\n"I am an Interrogator because it is my duty to the State. Treason must\r\nbe unmasked, the enemies of the State destroyed. It is necessary."\r\n\r\nLeslie looked up, and there seemed to be pity in his eyes. "Just one\r\nquestion, Kroll. 

Doesn\'t it bother you, when you go home? _How do you\r\nknow you\'re right and we\'re wrong?_"\r\n\r\nKroll started to say something, then saw there was no point in\r\nbothering.\r\n\r\n"Prisoner is dead," said the Inquisitor.\r\n\r\n"Take him away," ordered Kroll. The day was over.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat Leslie had said preyed on Kroll\'s mind all the way home. He got\r\nout of the tube and made his way to his austere room with his mind\r\nfixed on one question--the snarling words the dying prisoner had\r\nhurled at him: _How do you know you\'re right and we\'re wrong?_\r\n\r\nThey _had_ to be wrong, Kroll told himself firmly. The State had to\r\nbe right. It was necessary; it was logical; it was the way things had\r\nalways been.\r\n\r\nBut the thought obsessed him, and the image of Neil Leslie\'s face,\r\nbloody but undefeated, hung before him as he went about his evening\'s\r\nactivities. The face was still in his mind as he prepared to go to bed.\r\n\r\nOdd, Kroll thought. This was the first time he had been disturbed after\r\na torture session. He had seen hundreds--no, thousands--pass through\r\nthe Inquisitor, come out shambling rags of bone and flesh, and it had\r\nnever bothered him, because they were enemies of the State and deserved\r\nno more.\r\n\r\nHe dropped off into an uneasy sleep. But suddenly, in the small hours\r\nof the night, he sat bolt upright in bed, a cold, clammy perspiration\r\nbreaking out on him.\r\n\r\nLeslie had just asked the question for the hundredth time. And Kroll\r\nhad had no answer. He _didn\'t_ know who was right. He just didn\'t know.\r\nHis mind, unswervingly loyal for so many years, swayed in an agony of\r\ndoubt.\r\n\r\nHe got out of bed and paced back and forth across the floor of his room.\r\n\r\n"The State is wrong!" he said aloud. 

But it didn\'t sound right. It\r\ncouldn\'t be true. It wasn\'t true. "Stupid!" he told himself. It\r\nwas stupid to distrust the State--and wrong. "Wrong! Criminally,\r\ndisgustingly wrong!"\r\n\r\nThere! He felt better. He had rid himself of his foolish doubts. "How\r\ncould I have been so foolish?" he said aloud. His nerves felt better\r\nnow. Once again he was ready to do his duty as a loyal officer of the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nSmiling to himself for being so easily disturbed by the remarks of\r\ndisloyal traitors, he climbed back into bed and closed his eyes. A few\r\nmoments later, he was asleep.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, everything seemed to be all right; the terrors of the\r\nlast twelve hours were pale things of the past, no longer exerting\r\npressure on him. He caught the tube and headed to the Ministry.\r\n\r\nHe donned his uniform in the locker room and took the elevator to the\r\nInterrogation Floor. He stepped into his office. It was empty. 

No\r\nprisoners this morning? It didn\'t seem likely.\r\n\r\nHe pushed open the inner door and entered the Interrogation Chamber.\r\nTo his surprise, he saw Matthews, one of his assistants, wearing the\r\nuniform of an Interrogator and standing near the robot, arms folded.\r\n\r\n"What are you doing in here dressed that way?" Kroll snapped.\r\n\r\n"I am the new Interrogator," Matthews told him.\r\n\r\n"Since when?"\r\n\r\n"The appointment was made very early this morning," the Inquisitor\r\nsaid. "We have all the evidence we need to brand you as a traitor to\r\nthe State."\r\n\r\nThe new Interrogator turned a switch, and Kroll heard his own voice\r\ncome from a speaker. "_The State is wrong! Stupid! Wrong! Criminally,\r\ndisgustingly wrong! How could I have been so foolish?_"\r\n\r\n"There is no need to deny these words," said the Interrogator. "It is\r\nonly necessary that you tell us with whom you have been working."\r\n\r\n"But there\'s no one!" Kroll shouted. "You don\'t understand! 

I\'m loyal!\r\nI can explain!"\r\n\r\nBut the new Interrogator merely looked cold as the long, chilling metal\r\narms of the Inquisitor reached out and gathered Kroll to its steel\r\nbosom.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE INQUISITOR ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\xe2\x80\x99s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
