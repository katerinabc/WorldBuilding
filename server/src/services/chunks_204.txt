The women spread out along the\r\nbeach to gather driftwood, while the men took over the task of setting\r\nup the rain-catch.\r\n\r\nRyan could tell from the haggard faces around him that there would\r\nbe a dance that night. He knew his own face must be haggard too,\r\nhaggard and grimed with dust, the cheeks caved in, the eyes dark with\r\nhunger-shadows. The dogless days had been many this time.\r\n\r\nThe rain-catch was a crazy quiltwork pattern of dogskins laboriously\r\nsewn together into a makeshift tarpaulin. Ryan and the other young men\r\nheld it aloft while the older men set up the poles and tied the dog-gut\r\nstrings, letting the tarp sag in the middle so that when it rained the\r\nprecious water would accumulate in the depression. When the job was\r\ndone, the men went down to the beach and stood around the big fire the\r\nwomen had built.\r\n\r\nRyan\'s legs ached from the long trek through the hill country and his\r\nshoulders were sore from packing the dogskin tarp over the last five\r\nmiles. Sometimes he wished he was the oldest man in the tribe instead\r\nof the youngest: then he would be free from the heavy work, free to\r\nshamble along in the rear on marches; free to sit on his haunches\r\nduring stopovers while the younger men took care of the hunting and the\r\nlove-making.\r\n\r\nHe stood with his back to the fire, letting the heat penetrate his\r\ndogskin clothing and warm his flesh. Nearby, the women were preparing\r\nthe evening meal, mashing the day\'s harvest of tubers into a thick\r\npulp, adding water sparingly from their dogskin waterbags. Ryan\r\nglimpsed Merium out of the corner of his eye, but the sight of her\r\nthin young face and shapely body did not stir his blood at all, and he\r\nturned his eyes miserably away.\r\n\r\nHe remembered how he had felt about her at the time of the last dog\r\nkill--how he had lain beside her before the roaring fire, the aroma\r\nof roasted dog flesh still lingering in the night air. His belly had\r\nbeen full and he had lain beside her half the night, and he had almost\r\nwanted her. She had seemed beautiful then, and for many days afterward;\r\nbut gradually her beauty had faded away and she had become just another\r\ndrab face, another listless figure stumbling along with the rest of the\r\ntribe, from oasis to oasis, from ruin to ruin, in the eternal search\r\nfor food.\r\n\r\nRyan shook his head. He could not understand it. 

But there were so\r\nmany things that he could not understand. The Dance, for instance. Why\r\nshould the mouthing of mere words to the accompaniment of rhythmic\r\nmovements give him pleasure? How could hatred make him strong?\r\n\r\nHe shook his head again. In a way, the Dance was the biggest mystery of\r\nall....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMerium brought him his supper, looking up at him shyly with her large\r\nbrown eyes. Illogically, Ryan was reminded of the last dog he had\r\nkilled and he jerked the earthen pot out of her hands and walked down\r\nto the water\'s edge to eat alone.\r\n\r\nThe sun had set. Streaks of gold and crimson quivered in the\r\nwind-creased water, slowly faded away. Darkness crept down from the\r\ngullied foothills to the beach, and with it came the first cold breath\r\nof night.\r\n\r\nRyan shivered. He tried to concentrate on his food, but the memory of\r\nthe dog would not go away.\r\n\r\nIt had been a small dog, but a very vicious one. It had bared its teeth\r\nwhen at last he had cornered it in the little rocky cul-de-sac in the\r\nmountains, and as further evidence of its viciousness, it had wagged\r\nits ridiculous tail. Ryan could still remember the high-pitched sound\r\nof its growl--or was it a whine?--when he advanced on it with his club;\r\nbut most of all he remembered the way its eyes had been when he brought\r\nthe club down on its head.\r\n\r\nHe tried to free himself from the memory, tried to enjoy his tasteless\r\nmeal. But he went right on remembering. He remembered all the other\r\ndogs he had killed and he wondered why killing them should bother him\r\nso. Once, he knew, dogs had run with the hunters, not from them; but\r\nthat was long before his time--when there had been something else\r\nbesides dogs to hunt.\r\n\r\nNow it was different. Now it was dogs--or death....\r\n\r\nHe finished his meatless stew, swallowing the last mouthful grimly. He\r\nheard a soft step behind him, but he did not turn around. Presently\r\nMerium sat down beside him.\r\n\r\nThe sea glinted palely in the light of the first stars.\r\n\r\n"It\'s beautiful tonight," Merium said.\r\n\r\nRyan was silent.\r\n\r\n"Will there be a dance?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Maybe.

"\r\n\r\n"I hope there is."\r\n\r\n"Why?

"\r\n\r\n"I--I don\'t know. Because everyone\'s so different afterwards, I\r\nsuppose--so happy, almost."\r\n\r\nRyan looked at her. Starlight lay gently on her child-like face, hiding\r\nthe thinness of her cheeks, softening the hunger-shadows beneath her\r\neyes. Again he remembered the night he had almost wanted her and he\r\nwanted it to be the same again, only all the way this time. He wanted\r\nto want to take her in his arms and kiss her lips and hold her tightly\r\nto him, and when desire refused to rise in him, shame took its place,\r\nand because he couldn\'t understand the shame, he supplanted it with\r\nanger.\r\n\r\n"Men have no happiness!" he said savagely.\r\n\r\n"They did once--a long time ago.

"\r\n\r\n"You listen too much to the old women\'s tales."\r\n\r\n"I like to listen to them. I like to hear of the time when the ruins\r\nwere living cities and the earth was green--when there was an abundance\r\nof food and water for everyone.... Surely you believe there was such a\r\ntime. The words of the Dance--"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," Ryan said. "Sometimes I think the words of the Dance\r\nare lies."\r\n\r\nMerium shook her head. "No. The words of the Dance are wisdom. Without\r\nthem we could not live."\r\n\r\n"You talk like an old woman yourself!" Ryan said. Abruptly he stood up.\r\n"You _are_ an old woman. 

An ugly old woman!" He strode across the sand\r\nto the fire, leaving her alone by the water.\r\n\r\nThe tribe had broken up into groups. The old men huddled together in\r\none group, the younger men in another. The women sat by themselves near\r\nthe wavering perimeter of the firelight, crooning an ancient melody,\r\nexchanging an occasional word in low tones.\r\n\r\nRyan stood by the fire alone. He was the youngest male of the tribe.\r\nHe and Merium had been the last children to be born. The tribe had\r\nnumbered in the hundreds then, and the hunting had been good, the dogs\r\nstill tame and easy to find. There had been other tribes too, wandering\r\nover the dust-veiled land. Ryan wondered what had become of them. 

But\r\nhe only pretended to wonder. In his heart, he knew.\r\n\r\nIt was growing colder. He added more driftwood to the fire and watched\r\nthe flames gorge themselves. Flames were like men, he thought. They ate\r\neverything there was in sight, and when there was nothing more to eat,\r\nthey died.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuddenly a drum throbbed out and a woman\'s voice chanted: "What is a\r\ntree?"\r\n\r\nA voice answered from the group of old men: "A tree is a green dream."\r\n\r\n"What has become of the living land?

"\r\n\r\n"The living land is dust!"\r\n\r\nThe drum beat grew louder. Ryan\'s throat tightened. He felt the\r\nrefreshing warmth of anger touch his face. The opening phase of the\r\nDance always affected him, even when he was expecting it.\r\n\r\nOne of the old men was moving out into the firelight, shuffling his\r\nfeet to the beat of the drum. The light reddened the wrinkles on his\r\nthirty-year-old face, made a crimson washboard of his forehead. His\r\nthin voice drifted on the cold night air:\r\n\r\n    "_The living land is dust, and those\r\n    who turned it into dust\r\n    are dust themselves_--"\r\n\r\nA woman\'s voice took up the chant:\r\n\r\n    "_Our ancestors are dust:\r\n    dust are our gorged ancestors_--"\r\n\r\nThere were other figures shuffling in the firelight now, and the\r\nbeat on the dogskin drum head was sharper, stronger. Ryan felt the\r\nquickening of his blood, the surge of new-born energy.\r\n\r\nVoices blended:\r\n\r\n    "_Dust are our gorged ancestors,\r\n    our ancestors who raped the\r\n      fields and ravished the hills,\r\n    who cut the forest chains and\r\n      set the rivers free;\r\n    our ancestors who drank deep\r\n      from the well of the world\r\n    and left the well dry_--"\r\n\r\nRyan could contain himself no longer. He felt his own feet moving with\r\nthe vindictive beat of the drum. He heard his own voice take up the\r\nchant:\r\n\r\n    "_Let us take the memory of our ancestors\r\n    and tear it open, rend its vitals,\r\n    throw its entrails on the fire:\r\n    our ancestors, the eaters,\r\n    the putrefiers of the lakes and the rivers;\r\n    the consumers, the destroyers, the murderers of the living land;\r\n    the selfish, the obese, the great collectors,\r\n    who tried to devour the world_--"\r\n\r\nHe joined the stomping mass of the tribe, his hands going through the\r\nmimic motions of killing, rending, throwing. Strength flowed into his\r\nemaciated limbs, pulsed through his undernourished body. He glimpsed\r\nMerium across the fire and he caught his breath at the beauty of her\r\nanimated face. Again he almost wanted her, and for a while he was able\r\nto convince himself that some day he _would_ want her; that this time\r\nthe effect of the Dance would not wear off the way it always had\r\nbefore and he would go on feeling strong and confident and unafraid and\r\nfind many dogs to feed the tribe; then, perhaps, the men would want the\r\nwomen the way they used to, and he would want Merium, and the tribe\r\nwould increase and become great and strong--\r\n\r\nHe raised his voice higher and stomped his feet as hard as he could.\r\nThe hatred was like wine now, gushing hotly through his body, throbbing\r\nwildly in his brain. The chant crescendoed into a huge hysterical wail,\r\na bitter accusation reverberating over the barren hills and the dead\r\nsea, riding the dust-laden wind--\r\n\r\n    "_Our ancestors were pigs!\r\n    Our ancestors were pigs!..._"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE COURTS OF JAMSHYD ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!)

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\xe2\x80\x99s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
