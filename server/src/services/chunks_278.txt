But\r\n    given a wrong conclusion, you can still get a right answer!\r\n\r\nWALT and LEIGH RICHMOND\r\n\r\nIllustrated by John Schoenherr\r\n\r\n\r\nLittle Oley had wandered into forbidden territory again--Big Brother\r\nSven\'s ham shack. The glowing bottles here were an irresistible lure,\r\nand he liked to pretend that he knew all there was to know about the\r\nmysteries in this room.\r\n\r\nOf course, Sven said that not even _he_ knew all of the mysteries,\r\nthough he admitted he was one of the best ham operators extant, with\r\nQSOs from eighteen countries and thirty-eight states to his credit.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, Sven was busily probing into an open chassis with a hot\r\nsoldering iron.\r\n\r\n"Short\'s in here some place," he muttered.\r\n\r\n"What makes shorts, Sven?" Oley wasn\'t so knowledgeable but what he\r\nwould ask an occasional question.\r\n\r\nSven turned and glared down. 

"What are you doing in here? You know it\'s\r\na Federal Offense for anybody to come into this room without I say so?"\r\n\r\n"Momma and Hilda come in all the time, and you don\'t say so." 

Oley stood\r\nfirm on what he figured were legal grounds. "What makes shorts?

"\r\n\r\nSven relented a little. This brother had been something of a surprise to\r\nhim, coming along when Sven was a full ten years old. But, he reflected,\r\nafter a few years maybe I should get used to the idea. Actually, he sort\r\nof liked the youngster.\r\n\r\n"Shorts," he said, speaking from the superior eminence of his fourteen\r\nyears to the four-year-old, "is when electricity finds a way to get back\r\nwhere it came from without doing a lot of hard work getting there. But\r\nyou see, electricity like to work; so, even when it has an easy way, it\r\njust works harder and uses itself up."\r\n\r\nThis confused explanation of shorts was, of course, taken verbatim,\r\ndespite the fact that Oley couldn\'t define half the words and probably\r\ncouldn\'t even pronounce them.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like shorts. I don\'t like these pink shorts Momma put on me\r\nthis morning. Is they electrics, Sven?"\r\n\r\nSven glanced around at the accidentally-dyed-in-the-laundry, formerly\r\nwhite shorts.\r\n\r\n"Um-m-m. Yeah. You could call \'em electric."\r\n\r\nWith this Oley let out whoop and dashed out of the room, trailing a\r\nsmall voice behind him. "Momma, Momma. Sven says my shorts is electric!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll short Sven\'s electrics for him, if he makes fun of your shorts!"\r\nOley heard his mother\'s comforting reply.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the adult world days passed before Oley\'s accidentally acquired\r\npattern of nubilous information on the subject of shorts was enlarged.\r\nIt was only days in the adult world, but in Oley\'s world each day was a\r\nmountainous fraction of an entire lifetime, into which came tumbling and\r\njumbling--or were pulled--bits, pieces, oddments, landslides and\r\nacquisitions of information on every subject that he ran into, or that\r\nran into him. Nobody had told Oley that acquiring information was his\r\njob at the moment; the acquisition was partly accidental, mostly\r\ninstinctive, and spurred by an intense curiosity and an even more\r\nintense determination to master the world as he saw it.\r\n\r\nThere was the taste of the sick green flowers that Momma kept in the\r\nwindow box and, just for a side course, a little bit of the dirt, too.\r\nThere were the patterns of the rain on the window, and the reactions of\r\na cat to having its tail pulled. The fact that you touch a stove one\r\ntime, and it\'s cool and comfortable to lay your head against, and\r\nanother time it hurts. 

Things like that. 

And other things--towering\r\nadults who sometimes swoop down on you and throw you high into the air;\r\nand most times walk over you, around you, and ignore you completely. The\r\njumble of assorted and unsorted information that is the heritage of\r\nevery growing young inquiring brain.\r\n\r\nIn terms of time, it was only a couple of weeks, if you were looking at\r\nit as an adult, until the next "shorts" incident.\r\n\r\nOley was sitting peacefully at the breakfast table, doing his level best\r\nto control the manipulation of the huge knife-fork-and-spoon,\r\nplate-bowl-and-glass, from which he was expected to eat a meal. Things\r\nsmelled good. 

Momma was cooking doste, and that to Oley smelled best of\r\nall. The doster ticked quietly to itself, then gave a loud pop, and up\r\ncame two golden-brown slices of doste. Dostes? Oley wasn\'t sure. But he\r\nhadn\'t really begun paying too much attention to whether one doste was\r\nthe same as two doste or what, though he could quite proudly tell you\r\nthe difference between one and two.\r\n\r\nOut it came, and fresh butter was spread on it, and in went two shiny\r\nwhite beds, for some more doste.\r\n\r\nLittle Oley watched in fascination. And now he reached for the\r\ntremendous glass sitting on the table in front of him. But his fingers\r\ndidn\'t quite make it. Somehow, the glass was heavy and slippery, and it\r\neluded him, rolled over on its side, and spilled the bright purple juicy\r\ncontents out across the table in a huge swish.\r\n\r\nOley wasn\'t dismayed, but watched with a researcher\'s interest as the\r\nbright purple juice swept across the table towards the busily ticking\r\ndoster. Momma, of course, wasn\'t here, or she would have been gruff\r\nabout it. She\'d just gone into the other room.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe juice spread rapidly at first, and then more and more slowly, making\r\na huge, circuitous river spreading across the table, first towards the\r\ndoster and then away from it towards the frayed power-cord lying on the\r\ntable. It touched and began to run along the cord. Not a very eventful\r\nrecording so far, but Oley watched, charmed.\r\n\r\nAs he watched, a few bubbles began to appear near the frayed spot. A few\r\nwisps of steam. And then, suddenly, there was a loud, snarling\r\nsplat--and Momma screamed from the doorway. "That juice is making a\r\nshort!"\r\n\r\nThe information, of course, was duly recorded. Juice makes shorts.\r\n\r\nIt was a minor item of information, mixed into a jumble of others, and\r\nnothing else was added to this particular file for nearly another week.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOley was playing happily on the living room floor that night. Here there\r\nwas much to explore, though an adult might not have thought twice about\r\nit. Back in the corner behind Momma\'s doing bachine a bright, slender\r\npiece of metal caught Oley\'s attention. Bigger on one end than the\r\nother, but not really very big anywhere, the sewing machine needle\r\nproved fascinating. As a first experiment, Oley determined that it\r\nworked like a tooth by biting himself with it. After that he went around\r\nthe room, biting other things with it. Information, of course, is\r\ninformation, and to be obtained any way one can.\r\n\r\nThe brown, snaky lamp cord was the end of this experiment. Oley bit it,\r\nviciously, with his new tooth, and had only barely observed that it had\r\npenetrated completely through when there was a loud splat, and all the\r\nlights in the room went out.\r\n\r\nIn the darkness and confusion, of course, Oley moved away, seeking other\r\nnew experiences. So the cause of the short that Momma and Poppa yakked\r\nso loudly about was never attributed to Oley\'s actions, but only to "How\r\ncould a needle have gotten from your sewing machine into this lamp cord,\r\nAlice?"\r\n\r\nBut the sum of information had increased. Neatles stuck into lamp cords\r\nhad something to do with shorts.\r\n\r\nMore time passed. And this time the file on shorts was stimulated by\r\nPoppa. The big, rough, booming voice had always scared Oley a bit when\r\nit sounded mad, like now.\r\n\r\n"Alice, I\'ve just got to have some more shorts!"\r\n\r\nPoppa was rummaging in a drawer far above Oley\'s head, so he couldn\'t\r\nsee the object under discussion. But all he already knew about\r\nshorts--the information passed in review before him.\r\n\r\nShorts are useful. They help electrics to work harder.\r\n\r\nShorts you wear, and they are electrics.\r\n\r\nWires are electrics.\r\n\r\nShorts can be made by juice.\r\n\r\nShorts can be made by neatles, that bite like teeth.\r\n\r\nPoppa needs more shorts.\r\n\r\nBut Oley wasn\'t motivated to act at the moment. Just sorting out\r\ninformation and connecting it with other information files in the\r\nnecessarily haphazard manner that might eventually result in something\r\ncalled intelligence, although he didn\'t know that yet.\r\n\r\nIt was a week later in the kitchen, when Momma dropped a giant version\r\nof the neatle on the floor, that his information file in this area\r\nincreased again.\r\n\r\n"Is that a neatle?" Oley asked.\r\n\r\nHis mother laughed quietly and looked fondly at her son as she put the\r\nice pick back on the table.\r\n\r\n"I guess you could call it a needle, Oley," she told him. "An ice\r\nneedle."\r\n\r\nOley instinctively waited until Momma\'s back was turned before taking\r\nthe nice neatle to try its biting powers; and instinctively took it out\r\nof the kitchen before starting his experiments.\r\n\r\nAs he passed the cellar door he heard a soft gurgling and promptly\r\nchanged course. Pulling open the door with difficulty, he seated himself\r\non the cellar stairs to watch a delightful new spectacle--frothing,\r\ngurgling water making its way across the floor towards the stairs. It\r\nlooked wonderfully dirty and brown, and to Oley it was an absorbing\r\nphenomenon. It never occurred to him to tell Momma.\r\n\r\nSuddenly above him the cellar door slammed open, and Poppa came charging\r\ndown the stairs, narrowly missing the small figure, straight into the\r\nrising waters, intent, though Oley couldn\'t know it, on reaching the\r\ndrain pipe in the far corner of the cellar to plug it before water from\r\nthe spring rains could back up farther and really flood the cellar out.\r\n\r\nHalfway across the cellar, Poppa reached up and grasped the dangling\r\noverhead light to turn it on, in order to see his way to the drain--and\r\nsuddenly came to frozen, rigid, gasping stop as his hand clamped firmly\r\nover the socket.\r\n\r\nLittle Oley watched. There was juice in the cellar. Poppa had hold of an\r\nelectric. Was Poppa trying to make the shorts he needed?\r\n\r\nOley wasn\'t sure. He thought it probable. And from the superior\r\nknowledge of his four years, Oley already knew a better way to make\r\nshorts. Neatles make good shorts. Juice don\'t do so well.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, Oley decided to prove his point: Nice neatles probably made\r\neven better shorts than other neatles--and there was a big electric\r\nrunning up the side of the stairs--an electric fat enough to make a real\r\ngood shorts. Maybe lots of shorts.\r\n\r\nRaising his nice neatle, Oley took careful aim and plunged it through\r\nthe 220-volt stove feeder cable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOley woke up. The strange pretty lady in white was a new experience.\r\nSomebody he hadn\'t seen before. And there seemed to be something wrong\r\nwith his hand, but Oley hadn\'t noticed it very much, yet.\r\n\r\n"Well, my little Hero\'s awake! And how are you this morning? Your Momma\r\nand Poppa will be in to see you in just a minute."\r\n\r\nThe pretty lady in white went away, and Oley gazed around the white room\r\nwith its funny shape, happily recorded the experience, and dozed off\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly he was awakened again. Momma was there; and Poppa. 

And\r\nSven. But they all seemed different somehow this morning. Momma had been\r\ncrying, even though she was smiling bravely now. And Poppa seemed to\r\nhave a new softness that he\'d seldom seen before. Sven was looking\r\npuzzled.\r\n\r\n"I still say, Pop, that he\'s a genius. He _must_ have known what he was\r\ndoing."\r\n\r\n"Oley," Poppa\'s voice was husky--gruff, but kinder and softer than\r\nusual. "I want you to answer me carefully. 

But understand that it\'s all\r\nright either way. 

I just want you to tell me. Why did you put the ice\r\npick through the stove cable? You saved my life, you know. 

But I\'d like\r\nto know how you knew how."\r\n\r\nLittle Oley grinned. His world was peaceful and wonderful now. And all\r\nthe big adults were bending and leaning down and talking to him.\r\n\r\n"Nice neatle," he said. "Big electric. Poppa needed shorts."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Analog Science Fact & Fiction_ January\r\n    1964.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\xe2\x80\x99s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
