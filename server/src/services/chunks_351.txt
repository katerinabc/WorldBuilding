He scoffs\r\n            at scientific facts and keeps mumbling about--\r\n\r\n                           THE FROGS OF MARS\r\n\r\n                             By Roger Dee\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Imagination Stories of Science and Fantasy\r\n                              April 1954\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.

]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was nothing special about the little man who came into Larry\'s\r\nplace, unless it might have been his air of vague familiarity and the\r\nmixed expression on his face. He looked disgusted and defensive and at\r\nthe same time a little resentful, with a dash of something else thrown\r\nin which none of us recognized until later.\r\n\r\nI\'d have mistaken him for another reporter from the _Advertiser_\r\nacross the street if the five newsmen already at the bar hadn\'t given\r\neach other a blank look that meant only one thing: none of them knew\r\nhim. Neither did Larry, who was trying to bring in the first broadcast\r\nfrom Mars on the television set bracketed to the wall over his whiskey\r\nstock, and who wasn\'t pleased at having his little after-hours party\r\ncrashed.\r\n\r\n"The bar\'s closed," Larry said. His tone didn\'t invite argument. 

"City\r\nordinance. No customers after 1:00 a.m."\r\n\r\nThe little man looked at the clock, which said 3:15, and then at the\r\nfront windows which were shuttered tight. Then he looked at the six of\r\nus sitting at the bar with our drinks.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll have bourbon and water," he said. He sat down at the end of the\r\nbar on the stool next to mine and looked at his reflection in the\r\nmirror without approval.\r\n\r\nLarry got the look that bartenders get with troublesome customers.\r\n\r\n"The bar\'s closed," he said again. "It\'s a city--"\r\n\r\n"Water on the side," the little man said. "Don\'t mix it."\r\n\r\nAbe Marker, who does sports for the _Advertiser_, got up and checked\r\nthe front-door lock. The thumb-catch hadn\'t been thrown, so Abe put it\r\non and came back to the bar.\r\n\r\n"Nobody else will wander in," he said. "Make with the t-v, Larry.\r\nYou\'re holding up the show."\r\n\r\nLarry looked stubborn.\r\n\r\n"It\'s after 1:00 a.m.," he said. 

"And that door was supposed to be\r\nlocked. There\'s a city ordinance--"\r\n\r\n"You\'re breaking it already," the little man said, looking at us. He\r\ndidn\'t seem angry, just weary and disgusted. 

"Not that I give a damn.\r\nAll I want is a bourbon and water."\r\n\r\n"Better give it to him, Larry," Willard Saxton said from down the bar.\r\nWillard is the _Advertiser\'s_ science editor and is an authority on the\r\nplanets, especially Mars. "He\'ll probably turn you in if you throw him\r\nout."\r\n\r\nLarry muttered and looked mulish, but he rang up the little man\'s money\r\nand gave him a bourbon and water. The little guy drank it and looked\r\nat himself in the bar mirror with an expression that was just short\r\nof being a sneer. Larry grunted and went back to fiddling with the\r\ntelevision set.\r\n\r\nAbe Marker came over and sat down on the stool to my left.\r\n\r\n"They\'re doing this all over town tonight," he said, explaining to the\r\nlittle man across me. "The bars have to observe curfew as usual, but\r\nmost of them are letting a few regular customers stay late to see the\r\nMarscast. Everybody is anxious to know what Colonel Sanderson and his\r\ncrew found up there, so--"\r\n\r\n"They\'re going to be disappointed," the little man said. 

He sounded\r\nsour but positive. "Mars ain\'t what people think it is, not by a hell\r\nof a sight. It stinks."\r\n\r\nWe all looked up at that, and somebody snickered.\r\n\r\n"Have you been to Mars, sir?"\r\n\r\nThe little man didn\'t seem to mind when we laughed.\r\n\r\n"Maybe," he said, and shoved his shot glass forward. "Another bourbon,\r\nbartender."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe station announcer came on screen then and told us what we already\r\nknew, that contact with Colonel Sanderson\'s party was delayed because\r\nof transmission difficulties. The Sanderson expedition would leave Mars\r\nfor Earth in two more days, when the current opposition was completed,\r\nbut in the meantime the program sponsors appreciated the interest shown\r\nby their public and would relay the broadcast to us as soon as contact\r\nwas established.\r\n\r\nA film cartoon featuring a lizard named Freddie came on next, and Larry\r\nturned down the sound so he could hear orders for refills. The little\r\nman drank his bourbon and water and sneered at his reflection in the\r\nmirror; none of us paid him any further attention, but talk started up\r\nagain along the bar.\r\n\r\nSomebody at the other end asked how long it took a television signal\r\nto travel across all that space, and choked on his drink when Willard\r\nSaxton told him.\r\n\r\n"My God," he said when he stopped coughing. "You mean Mars is so far\r\naway it takes three minutes just to _see_ it?"\r\n\r\nAll of us laughed at that but Larry and the little man at the end of\r\nthe bar.\r\n\r\n"What I\'m wondering," somebody else said, "Is how the colonel and his\r\nboys feel after breathing nothing but canned air for a year."\r\n\r\n"Maybe the air up there is better than our scientists think," Abe\r\nMarker said. He winked at us and looked at the little man on my right.\r\n"How about it, friend? Is the air good on Mars?"\r\n\r\n"Breathable, but not good," the little guy said. 

"It smells like dead\r\nfish."\r\n\r\nSilence fell along the bar while we waited for a straight man to raise\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\nWillard Saxton took the bait. "And why should it smell so, may I ask?"\r\n\r\n"Because Mars is lousy with fish," the little man said. "And because\r\nwhen fish die, they stink."\r\n\r\nLarry did a brisk business for a few minutes while we sized the little\r\nguy up again. He definitely wasn\'t drunk, but the task of deciding\r\nwhether he was being dead-pan-comic or just nasty was a sort of\r\nchallenge that called for thought.\r\n\r\n"But you\'d need extensive oceans to support so many fish," Willard\r\nSaxton argued, still taking it seriously. "And if Mars had oceans we\'d\r\nhave seen them long ago. They reflect light."\r\n\r\n"Mars is too level for oceans," the little man said. "The water spreads\r\nout thin to make one big marsh, and you can\'t see it because the weeds\r\nthat grow up from the bottom camouflage it."\r\n\r\nSomebody down the bar said, "This gets curiouser and curiouser," and\r\neverybody laughed again but Willard and Larry and the little comic.\r\nSomebody else asked if he was a professional and what show was he on,\r\nbut he didn\'t answer. He just pushed his shot glass forward instead.\r\n\r\n"Another bourbon," he said.\r\n\r\nThe announcer came on screen again when the lizard cartoon went off\r\nand said that the Mars party\'s signal was beginning to come through\r\nand that as soon as it cleared up they would put it on the cable. Then\r\nhe told us about a new kind of pretzel prepared with a special salt\r\nguaranteed not to give us hardening of the arteries, and after that we\r\nhad another film cartoon. This one was about two crows at a circus, but\r\nnobody could follow it because Larry turned down the sound again.\r\n\r\nBetween his third and fourth stingers Willard Saxton--who had a\r\nreputation to uphold, being science editor of the _Advertiser_--had\r\nmade up his mind by now to put the little man in his place. It burned\r\nhim brown to see this character drinking bourbon and sneering at\r\nhimself in the mirror and not caring a damn what we thought, and it put\r\nWillard under a sort of obligation to show him up.\r\n\r\n"Reliable tests have conclusively proved," Willard said, "that the\r\natmosphere of Mars contains only minute traces of water vapor, and that\r\nits oxygen content is less than one-hundredth the density necessary to\r\nsustain human life. Spectroanalysis findings--"\r\n\r\n"A spectroanalysis of Earth from Mars," the little man said, "shows\r\nnothing beyond our Heaviside layer, and proves that we can\'t live here\r\nbecause nothing can breathe pure ozone."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe finished his bourbon and made chains of wet rings on the bartop with\r\nhis glass. The mixed look on his face was so strong that for a moment I\r\nalmost thought of the name for it.\r\n\r\nWillard stalled for time by ordering another stinger--a double, this\r\ntime--and Abe Marker took over.\r\n\r\n"How about those pictures of Martian dust storms the boys at Palomar\r\nmake?" Abe asked. "You can\'t have dust storms on a marshy planet, can\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"Those aren\'t dust storms," the little man said. "They\'re clouds of\r\ngnats."\r\n\r\n"_Gnats?_" we all said at once, and somebody down the bar,\r\nquicker-witted than the rest of us, added: "Gnats to you too, Charlie!"\r\n\r\n"A fact," the little man said, but not as if he cared. 

"They travel in\r\nswarms thousands of miles wide, and they bite like hell."\r\n\r\nWe sat and watched the two voiceless crows flap through the television\r\ncartoon for a while. Nobody spoke until the film was over and the\r\nscreen went blank, when the little man caught Larry\'s eye and held up\r\none finger.\r\n\r\n"Bourbon," he said.\r\n\r\nWe heard a confused muttering of voices in the background and waited\r\nexpectantly for Colonel Sanderson to speak to us from Mars, but\r\napparently the network people were still having trouble with their\r\ntransmission beam. The screen stayed blank.\r\n\r\n"You left out the interesting part, Charlie," somebody called from down\r\nthe bar. "The Martian natives. How about them?"\r\n\r\n"There aren\'t any--as you\'d know them," the little man said. He seemed\r\nto grow thoughtful for a moment. "But they are intelligent. They do\r\nthings you couldn\'t do."\r\n\r\n"Such as what?" somebody asked.\r\n\r\nThe little man shrugged. "Teleport. They\'re good at it too."\r\n\r\nSaxton let out a laugh. "That would make them more intelligent than\r\nus!" he said. "What do these Martians look like?"\r\n\r\nThe little man screwed up his face distastefully. "Frogs."\r\n\r\nThe reporter who had asked about natives got choked on his drink and\r\nhad to be pounded on the back. On my left, Abe Marker leaned against\r\nthe bar to look past me at the little guy.\r\n\r\n"Frogs we got now," he said admiringly. "By the billions?"\r\n\r\n"There are more frogs on Mars," the little man said, "than there are\r\ngnats and fish together, and they never stop croaking. You\'d have to\r\nhear it to believe it."\r\n\r\nThe television screen lit up suddenly, chopping off conversation, and\r\nwe were watching the first Marscast in history.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nColonel Sanderson himself was talking. He looked the way Stanley must\r\nhave looked when he found Livingstone, gaunt and bearded and jumpy; and\r\nhis crew, lined up behind him before the ship\'s pickup camera, were in\r\nno better shape. The lot of them stared hungrily out at us as if they\r\nhad just found a peephole into Heaven and couldn\'t wait to see if\r\nthere was a gate farther along the fence.\r\n\r\n"... established conceptions of Martian areography are completely\r\nerroneous," the colonel was saying. "There are no drifting deserts\r\nof sand or howling typhoons of ferrous dust. We can show you actual\r\nconditions better by camera, I think, than they could be detailed in\r\nwords."\r\n\r\nThe view jumped to another camera aimed from an outside port, and we\r\nsaw Mars. Colonel Sanderson\'s voice kept up a running commentary behind\r\nthe scene, but we only half heard him.\r\n\r\nThe ship rested in about two feet of water. Around it the whole world\r\ncurved up to the horizon in a shallow concave sweep like the inside of\r\na great rusty bowl, lined with knee-high reeds that grew as far as the\r\neye could see out of a knee-deep marsh. A fist-sized sun hung low in\r\nthe sky, its glare dulled to a muddy crimson by a shimmering cloud of\r\ngnats that whirled and danced to infinity. There was a sort of vast,\r\nfeatureless roaring in the background that sounded like Niagara at two\r\nhundred yards, not deafening but loud enough to force Colonel Sanderson\r\nto raise his voice.\r\n\r\n"The frog noise is worst," he was saying. "It drives us to the point\r\nof insanity at times.... One member of our party has succumbed to it\r\nalready, a machinist named Willkins who disappeared two weeks ago.\r\nApparently the poor fellow drowned himself in the marsh, since no trace\r\nof him has been found since."\r\n\r\nThat was when I realized why the little man on the stool beside me\r\nlooked so familiar--because I had seen his pictures in the papers,\r\nalong with the rest of Sanderson\'s crew, a thousand times during the\r\npast year. The mixed expression on his face made sense now, too; he\r\nwasn\'t only disgusted and defensive, he was _guilty_.\r\n\r\n"So that\'s how you knew what it was like," I said. "You couldn\'t stick\r\nit out with the others, so you jumped ship. You deserted!"\r\n\r\nHe gave me a hangdog look. "It\'s not deserting unless the country is at\r\nwar," he said. "It\'s just going over the hill, A.W.O.L."\r\n\r\nThe television roar got louder, and when I looked up the ship\'s\r\ncameraman was doing a close-up for our benefit. He panned the shot\r\ndownward until we seemed to be standing ten feet above the marsh, and\r\nat that distance I could see plainly what it was that caused the uproar.\r\n\r\nThe water between the reddish-brown reeds was thick with huge frogs,\r\nall blinking and croaking like mad.\r\n\r\nI remember thinking then that you couldn\'t really blame a man for\r\njumping ship in a hole like that. It was bad enough to be stuck\r\nthirty-odd million miles from home, so far that light itself needed\r\nthree minutes to--\r\n\r\n"Hey, wait up!" I said to the little guy, who was sneering at himself\r\nin the mirror again. "If you went A.W.O.L. up there, then how the hell\r\ndid you get back _here_?"\r\n\r\nI didn\'t find out.\r\n\r\nThe guy was gone. He had been standing there so close I could have\r\ntouched him, but now he was gone. I looked around quick. 

Nobody else\r\nseemed to have noticed. All eyes were on the TV screen.\r\n\r\nThen I saw it. On the floor. Two wet marks--right where the guy should\r\nhave been, where he _was_. Two wet marks that had a funny shape to\r\nthem--web-like.\r\n\r\nI felt my throat tighten at the thought. I shook my head. 

What was\r\ngoing through it was fantastic, impossible and downright lunacy. There\r\nwas an intelligent life-form on Mars--beings that looked like frogs\r\nand could teleport. Could they also mimic human shape temporarily?\r\nEspecially if they got hold of one for a model--say a missing\r\ncrewman....\r\n\r\n"Hey! Where are you going? 

Don\'t you want to see the Marscast?"\r\n\r\nI was walking to the door. I looked back at the barkeep. "I\'ve seen\r\nenough, Larry, I got things to do."\r\n\r\nHe shrugged. 

"Yeh, what?

"\r\n\r\n"Like hunting frogs," I told him as I shoved the door open. "I got a\r\nhunch we\'ll be doing a lot of that before very long...."\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE FROGS OF MARS ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\xe2\x80\x99s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
