]\r\n\r\n\r\nColen Shratt studied his image in the silver-framed mirror. His\r\nmustache was neatly clipped, his face clean shaven and well talcumed.\r\nHis captain\'s uniform--light blue--was pressed and looked as if it had\r\njust been bought. He was fastidious in everything he did.\r\n\r\nHe looked away from the mirror as the valet approached.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Barnes is ready to see you, sir," the valet said.\r\n\r\n"Good."\r\n\r\nCaptain Shratt was ushered into a study where Jules Barnes was waiting.\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you be seated?" Barnes invited.\r\n\r\nThe captain sat, laid his cap on his knee.\r\n\r\n"A drink?"\r\n\r\n"No, thank you.

"\r\n\r\n"Mind if I have one?"\r\n\r\n"Of course not."\r\n\r\nBarnes fixed himself a drink. He seated himself on a sofa, leaned back\r\nand said: "Now what\'s it all about? What would an intelligence officer\r\nwant with me?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not only representing the Americas at this moment, Mr. Barnes,\r\nbut all of earth as well. I\'m here to ask you to do a service for the\r\nworld."\r\n\r\n"A service?" Barnes sipped at his drink. "You must be mistaken about me\r\ncaptain. I\'m just a playwright."\r\n\r\n"But I haven\'t made a mistake, Mr. Barnes. And you _can_ save the\r\nworld. Just by writing a play.

"\r\n\r\n"Oh, come now."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Barnes, within two months we shall have a visitor from Mars."\r\n\r\nJules Barnes finished his drink. "You don\'t say?"\r\n\r\n"I do say."\r\n\r\n"Are you sure you won\'t have a drink? Or have you had too many?"\r\n\r\n"Mind if I use your phone?

"\r\n\r\n"Go right ahead."\r\n\r\nThe captain dialled a number, said into the mouthpiece: "General?...\r\nShratt. I\'m at Barnes.... Yes. 

Of course. Have the President put on,\r\nwill you?" The captain turned to Barnes. "You\'d recognize the voice of\r\nWilliam Livingstone, the President of the Americas, wouldn\'t you?"\r\n\r\nBarnes nodded his head silently.\r\n\r\nHe took the receiver from Shratt and listened gravely.\r\n\r\nThe captain watched the playwright put down the receiver. "Well?" 

he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nBarnes sat down, gulped noisily. "I\'m listening."\r\n\r\n"We\'re going to have a visitor from the planet Mars. Now supposedly,\r\nthey will be on a friendly mission. But that will not be so. Their\r\npurpose is to determine our strength. If they decide we are ahead in\r\nnuclear physics and rocket-ship expansion we will be attacked. If they\r\ndecide we are behind in experiments then we will be safe."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t understand. Why shouldn\'t they attack us if they know we are\r\nweak?"\r\n\r\n"They\'re not in any great hurry. If they believe we are strong and\r\nready to launch rocket ships into space then they will stop us,\r\ndetermined we should never leave our planet to conquer space. If they\r\nbelieve we are weak and backward, they will let us alone, for the time\r\nbeing. As long as we aren\'t a threat then they\'ll feel safe, ready to\r\nconquer us at their own sweet time. They move when they think we\'re\r\nstrong, ready to blast ships into space, ready to conquer the stars.\r\nTill then they\'ll let us alone, knowing we\'re weak and ineffectual."\r\n\r\n"How do you know all this?" Barnes asked, moving to make himself and\r\nShratt drinks. This time, the captain accepted his drink. "How can you\r\npossibly know of their plans?"\r\n\r\n"We\'ve picked up their ship by radar. We\'ve been listening in on their\r\nconversations with Mars through a new I.B.M. machine. And Germany\r\nhas sent their best code experts to give a hand. They broke down the\r\nlanguage. And the messages between Mars and their ship was in code.\r\nSo the experts did a double job, and well too, I might add. All the\r\ngovernments of the world have been alerted. 

They\'re all ready to\r\ncooperate.

"\r\n\r\n"Well, where do I come in?"\r\n\r\n"We want you to write a play."\r\n\r\n"A play?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. A play. And every industry on earth will be a participant. You\r\nwill write and direct. The world will be the stage. Don\'t you see? You\r\nwill write and direct every move that will convince the Martians we are\r\nbackward, we are nothing, we are insignificant. They must be convinced\r\nour industry doesn\'t compare with theirs, our brains are childish to\r\ntheirs, our leaders are weak and ineffectual, our weapons mere toys.\r\nYou must write this play before they get here. It will be your greatest\r\ntriumph. It will be the play of all plays. It will be the play that\r\nwill save the world from destruction. It must be written within a\r\nmonth. 

That\'s what we want you to do."\r\n\r\n"Within a month? That\'s impossible."\r\n\r\n"A month to write the play. A month to rehearse. Not even a month to\r\nrehearse. You have to get busy on it right away."\r\n\r\n"But how far are you advanced? Can you conquer space tomorrow?"\r\n\r\n"Of course not."\r\n\r\n"Then why go to all this trouble? Just let them see for themselves the\r\nway things really are. We can\'t possibly hurt them now. Why bother\r\nputting on an act for them?"\r\n\r\n"We are advanced to some degree, of course. Progress can\'t be stopped.\r\nBut we don\'t want them to know exactly how advanced we are. They are\r\nour enemy, you must remember that. We have to show them we are weaker\r\nthan we really are."\r\n\r\n"I see your logic."\r\n\r\n"Good. You will cooperate with us, then?"\r\n\r\n"Of course."\r\n\r\n"You realize that it must be a silent triumph for you, if we are\r\nsuccessful."\r\n\r\n"Of course. I\'m at your service."\r\n\r\n"You will start immediately. I\'ll keep in touch with you daily. You\'ll\r\nneed facts and figures, of course. You\'ll get a list of industry heads,\r\nscientists, and military men. They\'ll all be meeting our Martians. They\r\nmust have their lines to read, their every movements that will convince\r\nthe Martians of our stupidity."\r\n\r\n"It\'s going to be some political football at the next election. You\r\ncan\'t keep the politicians silent."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, we can."\r\n\r\n"This will be more like a project than a play."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll have to take my leave now, Mr. Barnes." The Captain stood up. "I\r\nhave many matters to attend to."\r\n\r\n"Of course. Good day, captain."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJules Barnes worked on his play every waking hour. His eyes grew tired,\r\nhis fingers grew stiff, his brain grew weary. The play was finished in\r\ntwenty-five days. He handed it to Captain Shratt and went to sleep five\r\nminutes later.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCaptain Shratt shrugged off all suggestion of getting a top Broadway\r\ndirector to handle the second assignment, that of directing the\r\nparticipants of the play. So Jules Barnes directed the military, the\r\nindustry, the sciences, in their performances which would take place\r\nwhen the adversary would come face to face with the earth\'s genius.\r\n\r\nBarnes and Shratt went from government to government by jet, meeting\r\nthe brains of each power, directing and coaching.\r\n\r\n"Finished," Captain Shratt said, leaning back in his seat as the jet\r\ntook off for Washington.\r\n\r\n"What if it doesn\'t come off?" Barnes said.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t think about it."\r\n\r\nBarnes felt his stomach jump toward his back as the ship hummed its way\r\ntowards the heavens. He still hadn\'t gotten used to the jets. When the\r\nplane leveled off, he said: "We could always capture the Martians, hold\r\nthem as hostages."\r\n\r\n"Do you possibly think they hold as great a price on life as we do?\r\nTheir philosophy is as different from ours as night and day."\r\n\r\n"You seem to know an awful lot about them."\r\n\r\n"Our men are listening in on every conversation that passes between\r\ntheir ship and Mars. We\'ve learned a lot."\r\n\r\n"I\'m beginning to think you\'re more advanced than you\'re letting on."\r\n\r\n"In many matters, Mr. Barnes you\'re still an outsider. Security, you\r\nmust understand. 

Especially now. You\'ve done the earth a great service\r\nbut I\'m still under orders. There are many things I can\'t let you in\r\non. If you were a soldier, you\'d readily understand. So a certain wall,\r\nnot too high, though, must always remain between us."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not a soldier, true, but I do understand."\r\n\r\n"You may be interested to know that the ship will be landing within the\r\nweek."\r\n\r\n"Really? I guess I\'d better stay out of the way."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you\'ll be on hand. In case something goes wrong and a new line\r\nmust be written into the script fast. There must be no blunders. If\r\nthere are then we must cover up. So you\'ll be close by, ready to write,\r\nready to coach."\r\n\r\n"I wonder what they\'ll look like.

"\r\n\r\n"You\'ll be finding out soon enough."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn order to avert panic, the world was alerted to the coming of the\r\nMartians four days before the strange arrival.\r\n\r\nThey came.\r\n\r\nTall and thin with translucent skin and eyes that were almost\r\ninvisible, they were that small. There were four. 

Two men and two\r\nwomen. The women\'s hair was as short as the men\'s. Their breasts made\r\nslight bulges under their tunics.\r\n\r\nIt seemed they had listened in to radio broadcasts and spoke English,\r\nFrench, Italian, Polish, and Spanish very well. They knew the Americas\r\nwas the strongest of the world governments and so had landed there. The\r\nyear, 1968, became a memorable year. The year when contact was made\r\nwith another planet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJules Barnes stayed on the sidelines. During the three weeks the\r\nMartians remained there was no need for him. But he stayed by, ready to\r\nact in any way he was needed.\r\n\r\nThe Martians went from government to government, inspecting industry,\r\nmeeting scientists and military men. Everything was as friendly as\r\ncould be. When the Martians retired to their rooms, they had hurried\r\nconversations. We were behind the times, our scientists were incredibly\r\nstupid, our military men were old ladies and our industry was only fit\r\nto make children\'s toys.\r\n\r\nHidden microphones revealed all this.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Everything has gone according to plan," Captain Shratt told Barnes the\r\nday the Martians blasted off for their home planet. "We\'ve nothing to\r\nworry about.

"\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad. I\'ve been on edge the whole time they were here."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got reports to make out so I\'ll have to leave now. 

But we\'ll get\r\ntogether again sometime."\r\n\r\n"Certainly." Barnes shook hands and Shratt left the playwright\'s\r\napartment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Hello, General," Captain Shratt said, entering his office. He took off\r\nhis cap, tossed it on a leather chair, and went behind his desk.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve come from the president," the general said. "He says the time has\r\ncome."\r\n\r\n"Good." Shratt sat down. "I wish I was coming along."\r\n\r\n"You\'re needed here. What about this fellow Barnes? He knows an awful\r\nlot."\r\n\r\n"We\'ve nothing to worry from him. Besides, once we\'ve started there\'s\r\nnothing anyone can do."\r\n\r\n"Our fleet of Space ships is ready to take off within hours."\r\n\r\n"It\'s best to wait till the Martian ship is well on its way. Then we\r\ncan start operations. When we get to Mars they\'ll be unprepared. Earth\r\nwill be supreme." Captain Shratt lit a cigarette. "Only Mars could have\r\nstopped us if they\'d decided to attack us. Now that threat is gone.\r\nThey won\'t know what hit them. 

Thanks to a playwright and his sense of\r\ndevotion to earth."\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK NOT IN THE SCRIPT ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\xe2\x80\x99s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
