FONTENAY\r\n\r\n\r\n _This could well have been Montcalm\'s greatest opportunity;\r\n a chance to bring mankind priceless gifts from worlds beyond.\r\n But Montcalm was a solid family man--and what about that nude\r\n statue in the park?_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was one of those rare strokes of poetic something-or-other that the\r\nwhole business occurred the morning after the stormy meeting of the\r\nTraskmore censorship board.\r\n\r\nLike the good general he was, Richard J. Montcalm had foreseen trouble\r\nat this meeting, for it was the boldest invasion yet into the territory\r\nof evil and laxity. His forces were marshaled. 

Several of the town\'s\r\nministers who had been with him on other issues had balked on this one,\r\nbut he had three of them present, as well as heads of several women\'s\r\nclubs.\r\n\r\nAs he had anticipated, the irresponsible liberals were present to do\r\nbattle, headed by red-haired Patrick Levitt.\r\n\r\n"This board," said Levitt in his strong, sarcastic voice, "has gone too\r\nfar. It was all right to get rid of the actual filth ... and everyone\r\nwill agree there was some. But when you banned the sale of some\r\nmagazines and books because they had racy covers or because the contents\r\nwere a little too sophisticated to suit the taste of members of this\r\nboard ... well, you can carry protection of our youth to the point of\r\ninsulting the intelligence of adults who have a right to read what they\r\nwant to."\r\n\r\n"You\'re talking about something that\'s already in the past, Mr. 

Levitt,"\r\nsaid Montcalm mildly. 

"Let\'s keep to the issue at hand. You won\'t deny\r\nthat children see this indecent statue every day?"\r\n\r\n"No, I won\'t deny it!" snapped Levitt. 

"Why shouldn\'t they see it? They\r\ncan see the plate of the original in the encyclopaedia. It\'s a fine copy\r\nof a work of art."\r\n\r\nMontcalm waited for some rebuttal from his supporters, but none was\r\nforthcoming. On this matter, they apparently were unwilling to go\r\nfarther than the moral backing of their presence.\r\n\r\n"I do not consider the statue of a naked woman art, even if it is called\r\n\'Dawn,\'" he said bitingly. He looked at his two colleagues and received\r\ntheir nods of acquiescence. He ruled: "The statue must be removed from\r\nthe park and from public view."\r\n\r\nLevitt had one parting shot.\r\n\r\n"Would it solve the board\'s problem if we put a brassiere and panties on\r\nthe statue?" he demanded.\r\n\r\n"Mr. 

Levitt\'s levity is not amusing. The board has ruled," said Montcalm\r\ncoldly, arising to signify the end of the meeting.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat night Montcalm slept the satisfied sleep of the just.\r\n\r\nHe awoke shortly after dawn to find a strange, utterly beautiful naked\r\nwoman in his bedroom. For a bemused instant Montcalm thought the statue\r\nof Dawn in the park had come to haunt him. His mouth fell open but he\r\nwas unable to speak.\r\n\r\n"Take me to your President," said the naked woman musically, with an\r\naccent that could have been Martian.\r\n\r\nMrs. Montcalm awoke.\r\n\r\n"What\'s that? 

What is it, Richard?" she asked sleepily.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t look, Millie!" exclaimed Montcalm, clapping a hand over her eyes.\r\n\r\n"Nonsense!" she snapped, pushing his hand aside and sitting up. She\r\ngasped and her eyes went wide, and in an instinctive, unreasonable\r\nreaction she clutched the covers up around her own nightgowned bosom.\r\n\r\n"Who are you, young woman?" demanded Montcalm indignantly. 

"How did you\r\nget in here?"\r\n\r\n"I am a visitor from what you would call an alien planet," she said. "Of\r\ncourse," she added thoughtfully, "it isn\'t alien to me."\r\n\r\n"The woman\'s mad," said Montcalm to his wife. A warning noise sounded in\r\nthe adjoining bedroom. Alarmed, he instructed: "Go and keep the children\r\nout of here until I can get her to put on some clothes. They mustn\'t see\r\nher like this."\r\n\r\nMrs. Montcalm got out of bed, but she gave her husband a searching\r\nglance.\r\n\r\n"Are you sure I can trust you in here with her?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Millie!" exclaimed Montcalm sternly, shocked. She dropped her eyes and\r\nleft the room. When the door closed behind her, he turned to the strange\r\nwoman and said:\r\n\r\n"Now, look, young lady, I\'ll get you one of Millie\'s dresses. You\'ll\r\nhave to get some clothes on and leave."\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t you going to ask me my name?" asked the woman. "Of course, it\'s\r\nunpronounceable to you, but I thought that was the first thing all Earth\r\npeople asked of visitors from other planets."\r\n\r\n"All right," he said in exasperation. "What\'s your name?"\r\n\r\nShe said an unpronounceable word and added: "You may call me Liz."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMontcalm went to the closet and found one of Millie\'s house dresses. He\r\nheld it out to her beseechingly.\r\n\r\nAs he did so, he was stricken with a sudden sharp feeling of regret that\r\nshe must don it. Her figure ... why Millie had never had a figure like\r\nthat! At once, he felt ashamed and disloyal and sterner than ever.\r\n\r\nLiz rejected the proffered garment.\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t think of adopting your alien custom of wearing clothing,"\r\nshe said sweetly.\r\n\r\n"Now look," said Montcalm, "I don\'t know whether you\'re drunk or crazy,\r\nbut you\'re going to have to put something on and get out of here before\r\nI call the police."\r\n\r\n"I anticipated doubt," said Liz. 

"I\'m prepared to prove my identity."\r\n\r\nWith the words, the two of them were no longer standing in the Montcalm\r\nbedroom, but in a broad expanse of green fields and woodland, unmarred\r\nby any habitation. Montcalm didn\'t recognize the spot, but it looked\r\nvaguely like it might be somewhere in the northern part of the state.\r\n\r\nMontcalm was dismayed to find that he was as naked as his companion!\r\n\r\n"Oh, my Lord!" he exclaimed, trying to cover himself with a September\r\nMorn pose.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m sorry," apologized Liz, and instantly Montcalm\'s pajamas were\r\nlying at his feet. He got into them hurriedly.\r\n\r\n"How did we get here?" he asked, his astonished curiosity overcoming his\r\ndisapproval of this immodest woman.\r\n\r\n"By a mode of transportation common to my people in planetary\r\natmospheres," she answered. "It\'s one of the things I propose to teach\r\nyour people."\r\n\r\nShe sat down cross-legged on the grass. Montcalm averted his eyes, like\r\nthe gentleman he was.\r\n\r\n"You see," said Liz, "the people of your world are on the verge of going\r\nto space and joining the community of worlds. It\'s only natural the rest\r\nof us should wish to help you. We have a good many things to give you,\r\nto help you control the elements and natural conditions of your world.\r\nThe weather, for example ..."\r\n\r\nSuddenly, out of nowhere, a small cloud appeared above them and spread,\r\nblocking out the early sun. It began to rain, hard.\r\n\r\nThe rain stopped as suddenly as it had begun and the cloud dissipated.\r\nMontcalm stood shivering in his soaked pajamas and Liz got to her feet,\r\nher skin glistening with moisture.\r\n\r\n"You have a problem raising food for your population in some areas," she\r\nsaid....\r\n\r\nA small haw-apple tree near them suddenly began to grow at an amazing\r\nrate of speed. It doubled its size in three minutes, put forth fruit\r\nand dropped it to the ground.\r\n\r\n"These are only a few of the things I\'ll give to your planet," she said.\r\n\r\nAt her words, they were back in the bedroom. This time she had been\r\nthoughtful. Montcalm was still clad in wet pajamas.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what sort of hypnosis this is," he began aggressively,\r\n"but you can\'t fool me, young lady, into believing ..."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMillie came into the room. She had donned a robe over her nightgown.\r\n\r\n"Richard, where have you been with this woman?" she demanded.\r\n\r\n"Why, my dear ..."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve been roaming around the house somewhere with her. I came in here\r\na moment ago and you were gone. Now, Richard, I want you to do something\r\nabout her and stop fooling around. I can\'t keep the children in their\r\nroom all day."\r\n\r\nIt hadn\'t been hypnosis then! Liz was for real. A vision rose before\r\nMontcalm of mankind given wonders, powers, benefits representing\r\nadvances of thousands of years. The world could become a paradise with\r\nthe things she offered to teach.\r\n\r\n"Millie, this woman _is_ from another planet!" he exclaimed excitedly,\r\nand turned to Liz. "Why did you choose me to contact on Earth?"\r\n\r\n"Why, I happened to land near your house," she answered. "I know how\r\nyour primitive social organization is set up, but isn\'t one human being\r\njust as good as another to lead me to the proper authorities?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said joyfully, visualizing black headlines and his picture in\r\nthe papers.\r\n\r\nMillie stood to one side, puzzled and grim at once. Montcalm picked up\r\nthe house dress he had taken from the closet earlier.\r\n\r\n"Now, Miss," he said, "if you\'ll just put this on, I\'ll take you to the\r\nmayor and he can get in touch with Washington at once."\r\n\r\n"I told you," said Liz, "I don\'t want to adopt your custom of wearing\r\nclothing."\r\n\r\n"But you can\'t go out in public like that!" said the dismayed Montcalm.\r\n"If you\'re going to move among Earth people, you must dress as we do."\r\n\r\n"My people wouldn\'t demand that Earth people disrobe to associate with\r\nus," she countered reasonably.\r\n\r\nMillie had had enough. She went into action.\r\n\r\n"You can argue with this hussy all you like, Richard, but I\'m going to\r\ncall the police," she said, and left the room with determination in her\r\neye.\r\n\r\nThe next fifteen minutes were agonizing for Montcalm as he tried\r\nfutilely to get Liz to dress like a decent person. He was torn between\r\nrealization of what the things she offered would mean to the world and\r\nhis own sense of the fitness of things. His children, the children of\r\nTraskmore, the children of the world ... what would be the effect on\r\ntheir tender morals to realize that a sane adult was willing to walk\r\naround in brazen nakedness?\r\n\r\nThere was a pounding on the front door, and the voice of Millie inviting\r\nthe law into the house.\r\n\r\n"Now I\'m afraid you\'re due to go to jail," said Montcalm mournfully.\r\n"But when they get some clothes on you, I\'ll try to explain it and get\r\nyou an audience with the mayor."\r\n\r\nTwo blue-clad policemen entered the room.\r\n\r\nOne policeman took the house dress from Montcalm\'s lax fingers and\r\ntossed it over Liz\' head without further ado.\r\n\r\nLiz did not struggle. She looked at Montcalm with a quizzical\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry," she said. "My people made a mistake. If you Earth people\r\naren\'t tolerant enough to accept a difference in customs of dress, I\'m\r\nafraid you\'re too immature.

"\r\n\r\nWith that, she was gone like a puff of air. The astonished policemen\r\nheld an empty dress.\r\n\r\nMontcalm didn\'t see the flying saucer that whizzed over Traskmore that\r\nmorning and disappeared into the sky, but he didn\'t doubt the reports.\r\nHe debated with himself for a long time whether he had taken the right\r\nattitude, but decided he had.\r\n\r\nAfter all, there were the children to consider.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Science Fiction Stories_\r\n    September 1958.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\xe2\x80\x99s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
