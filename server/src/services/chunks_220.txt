C. BECK\r\n\r\n           _In perspective, theoretically the vanishing\r\n           point is at infinity, and therefore unattainable.\r\n           But reality is different; vanishment occurs a lot\r\n           sooner than theory suggests ..._\r\n\r\n                         Illustrated by Martinez\r\n\r\n\r\nThat? Oh, that\'s a perspective machine. 

Well, not exactly, but that\'s\r\nwhat I call it. 

No, I don\'t know how it works. Too complicated for me.\r\nCarter could make it go, but after he made it he never used it. Too bad;\r\nhe thought he\'d make a lot of money with it there for awhile, while he\r\nwas working it out. Almost had me convinced, but I told him, "Get it to\r\nworking first, Carter, and then show me what you can do with it better\r\nthan I can do without it. I\'m doing pretty well as is ... pictures\r\nselling good, even if I do make \'em all by guesswork, as you call it."\r\nThat\'s what I told him.\r\n\r\nY\'see, Carter was one a them artists that think they can work everything\r\nout by formulas and stuff. Me, I just paint things as I see \'em. Never\r\nworry about perspective and all that kinda mechanical aids. Never even\r\nwent to Art School. 

But I do all right. Carter, now, was a different\r\nsorta artist. Well, he wasn\'t really an artist--more of a draftsman.\r\n\r\nI first got him in to help me with a series of real estate paintings I\'d\r\ngot an order for. Big aerial views of land developments, and drawings of\r\nbuildings, roads and causeways, that kinda stuff. Was a little too much\r\nfor me to handle alone, \'cause I never studied that kinda things, ya\r\nknow. I thought he\'d do the mechanical drawings, which shoulda been\r\nsimple for anybody trained that way, and I\'d throw in the colors,\r\nfigures and trees and so on. He did fine. Job came out good; client was\r\nreal happy. We made a pretty good amount on the job, enough to keep us\r\nfor a coupla months without working afterwards. I took it easy, fishing\r\nand so on, but Carter stayed here in the studio working on his own\r\nstuff. I let him keep an eye on things for me around the place, and just\r\ndropped in now and then to check up.\r\n\r\nThe guy was nuts on the subject of perspective. I thought he knew all\r\nthere was to know about it already, but he claimed _nobody_ knew\r\nanything about it, really. Said he\'d been studying it for years, and the\r\nmore he learned about it the more there was to learn. He used to cover\r\nbig sheets of paper with complicated diagrams trying to prove something\r\nor other to himself. I\'d come into the studio and find him with thumb\r\ntacks and strings and stuff all over the place. He\'d get big long rulers\r\nand draw lines to various points all over the room, and end up with a\r\nlittle drawing of a cube about an inch square that anybody coulda made\r\nin a half a minute without all the apparatus. Seemed pretty silly to me.\r\n\r\nThen he brought in some books on mathematics and physics and other\r\nthings, and a bunch of slide rules, calculators, and junk. He musta been\r\na pretty smart guy to know how to handle all those things, even if he\r\nwas kinda dopey about other things. You know ... women and fishing and\r\nsports and drinking; he was lousy at everything except working those\r\nperspective problems. Personally, I couldn\'t see much sense to what he\r\nwas doing. The guy could draw all right already, so I asked him what\r\nmore did he want? Lemme see if I can remember what he said.\r\n\r\n"I\'m trying to get at things as they really are, not as they appear," he\r\nsaid. I think those were his words. "Art is an illusion, a bag of\r\ntricks. Reality is something else, not what we _think_ it is. Drawings\r\nare two-dimensional projections of a world that is not merely three- but\r\nfour-dimensional, if not more," he said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYeh, kind of a crackpot, Carter was. Just on that one subject, though;\r\nnice enough guy otherwise. 

Here, look at some of the drawings he made,\r\nworking out his formulas. Nice designs, huh? Might make good wall paper\r\nor fabric patterns. Real abstract ... that\'s what people seem to like.\r\nSee all those little letters scattered around among the lines? Different\r\nkinds of vanishing points, they are. Carter claimed the whole world was\r\nfull of vanishing points. You don\'t know what a vanishing point is?\r\nLemme see if I can explain. Come over to the window here.\r\n\r\nYa see how that road out there gets smaller and smaller in the distance?\r\nOf course the road doesn\'t really get smaller--it just looks that way.\r\nThat\'s what we call a vanishing point in drawing. Simple, isn\'t it?\r\nNever could understand why Carter went to so much trouble working out\r\nall those ways to locate vanishing points. Me, I just throw \'em in\r\nwherever I need \'em. But Carter claimed that was wrong. Said they were\r\nall connected together some way, and he was gonna work out a method to\r\nprove it.\r\n\r\nHere ... here\'s a little gadget he made up to help his calculations.\r\nBunch of disks all pivoted together at the center; you\'re supposed to\r\nturn \'em around so the arrows point to the different figures and things.\r\nHere\'s the square root sign, I remember Carter telling me that. This one\r\nis the Tangent Function, whatever that means. Log, there, is short for\r\nlogarithm. Oh, he had a bunch of that scientific stuff in his head all\r\nthe time; dunno whether he understood it all himself. He built this\r\nthing just before he put together the perspective machine there.\r\n\r\nSilly-looking gadget, huh? All them pipes and wires and that little cube\r\nin the center ... don\'t try to touch it, it ain\'t really there. 

You just\r\nthink it is. It\'s what Carter called a teteract, or a cataract ... no,\r\nthat ain\'t the right word. Somepin\' like that--tesser something or\r\nother. 

There\'s a picture like it in one of Carter\'s books. Hurts your\r\neyes to look at it, don\'t it?\r\n\r\nThat\'s what Carter thought was going to make him a lot of fame and\r\nmoney, that perspective machine. I told him nobody\'d ever made a drawing\r\nmachine yet that worked, but he said it wasn\'t supposed to make\r\ndrawings. It was just supposed to give people a view of what reality\r\nreally is, instead of what they think it is. I dunno whether he expected\r\nto charge money to look through it, or whether he was gonna look through\r\nit himself and make some new kinda drawings and sell \'em.\r\n\r\nNo, I can\'t tell you how it works--I said before I don\'t know. Carter\r\nonly used it once himself. I came in here the day he finished it, just\r\nas he was ready to turn it on. He was just putting the finishing touches\r\non it.\r\n\r\n"In a few minutes," he told me, "I\'ll have the answer to a question that\r\nmay never have been answered before: what is reality? Is the world a\r\nthing by itself, and all we know illusion? Why do things grow smaller\r\nthe farther away from us they appear? Why can\'t we see more than one\r\nside of anything at a time? What happens to the far side of an object;\r\ndoes it cease to exist just because we can\'t see it? Are objects not\r\npresent nonexistent? Because artists draw things vanishing to points,\r\ndoes that mean that they really vanish?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA wack, that\'s what he was. 

Nice guy, but sorta screwy. He kept saying\r\nmore goofy things while he was finishing up the machine, about how he\'d\r\nfigured out that all we knew about vision and drawing and so on must be\r\nwrong, and that once he got a look at the real world he\'d prove it.\r\n\r\n"How about cameras?" I asked him. "Take a picture with a camera and it\r\nlooks just about the same as a drawing, don\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s because cameras are built to take pictures like we\'re used to\r\nseeing them," he said. "Flat, two-dimensional slices of reality, without\r\ndepth or motion."\r\n\r\n"Even 3-D moving pictures?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"They\'re closer to reality," he admitted. "But they are still only cross\r\nsections of it. The shutter of a movie camera is closed as much of the\r\ntime as it is open. What happens in between the times it\'s open?\r\n\r\n"You know," he went on, "people used to think matter and motion were\r\ncontinuous, but scientists have proved that they are discontinuous. Now\r\nsome of them think time may be, too. Maybe everything is just imaginary,\r\nand appears to our senses in whatever way we want it to appear. We are\r\nso well-trained that we see everything just as we are taught to see it\r\nby generations of artists, writers, and other symbol-makers. If we could\r\nsee things as they really are, what might happen?"\r\n\r\n"We\'d probably all go nuts!" I told him. 

He just smiled.\r\n\r\n"Well, here goes," he said. "It\'s finished. Now to find out who is\r\nright, the scientists and philosophers who say reality is forever\r\nunreachable, or the artists who say there isn\'t any reality--that we\r\nmake the whole thing up to suit ourselves."\r\n\r\nHe moved one of those pointers you see there, and squinted around at the\r\ndifferent scales and dials, and then stepped back. That little\r\ntessy-thing appeared, real small at first. Just a point; you could\r\nhardly see it. I couldn\'t see anything else happening, and thought he\r\nwas gonna do somepin\' else to the machine. I turned to look at Carter,\r\nand saw his face was white as a sheet.\r\n\r\n"Good Gawd!" he says, just like that: "Good Gawd!" That\'s all.\r\n\r\n"Well," I says to him, "who was right, the scientists or the artists?"\r\n\r\n"The artists!" he sorta screeches. "The artists were right all the time\r\n... there _is_ no reality! It\'s all a fabric of illusion we\'ve created\r\nourselves! 

And now I\'ve ripped a hole in that!

"\r\n\r\nHe gives a strangled hoot and goes hightailin\' outta here like somepin\'\r\nwas after him. Jumps in his car and roars off down the road and\r\ndisappears.\r\n\r\nNaw, I don\'t mean he really disappeared--are you nuts? Just roared on\r\ndown the road till he got so small I couldn\'t see him no more. 

You\r\nknow--the way things do when they go farther and farther away. Happens\r\nevery day; that\'s what us artists mean by perspective.\r\n\r\nThe machine? Well, I dunno what to do with it. If Carter ever comes back\r\nhe might not like my getting rid of it. I was thinking mebbe I\'d put it\r\nin the hobby show at the county fair next week, though. Ya notice how\r\nthat funny-looking cube inside there gets bigger every time you look at\r\nit? There ... it just doubled its size again, see? People at the fair\r\noughtta get a big kick outta that. No telling how big it\'ll get with all\r\nthose people looking at it.\r\n\r\nBut come on, let\'s go fishing. We\'d better hurry or it\'ll be too late.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Astounding Science Fiction_ July 1959.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\xe2\x80\x99s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
