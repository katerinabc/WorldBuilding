In that way he escaped the annihilation along with one other\r\nman, revered old Dr. Garfield Gar, who was in the space station.\r\n\r\nRoy had backed well off in preparation for a mach ten dive on Kabul,\r\nwhich the enemy had lately taken over. He had one small omnibomb left\r\nin his racks and Kabul had seemed to be about the right size. But then\r\nthe destruction of Earth changed his plans.\r\n\r\nHe watched, expressionless, as the planet exploded. He shrugged. There\r\nwas nothing to do now but go see Dr. Gar.\r\n\r\nRoy\'s foescope clamored insistently and he tensed, thinking a\r\nspaceborne enemy was on him, but it was only a piece of exploding Earth\r\nstumbling by.\r\n\r\nDr. Gar was alone in the space station because all able-bodied men had\r\nbeen called to fight World War V. The governments of Earth, in a rare\r\nmoment of conscience during the Short Truce, had agreed that Dr. Gar,\r\nas the embodiment of all Earthly knowledge, should be protected from\r\nharm.\r\n\r\nPilot Officer Roy Vanjan didn\'t receive as warm a reception from old\r\nDr. Gar as he might have, considering that they were the only two\r\npeople left. The old man was combing his white beard with his fingers\r\nand didn\'t offer to shake hands.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Roy as he defused his bomb and secured his single-seater\r\nin the spacelock, "I guess it\'s all over."\r\n\r\n"Scarcely a historic statement," Dr. 

Gar said, "but it describes the\r\nsituation."\r\n\r\n"If you don\'t have anything for me to do I\'d just as soon have a drink.\r\nThey usually let me have a stiff one after I complete a mission."\r\n\r\nDr. Gar examined the hard young pilot from under shaggy white eyebrows.\r\n"I do have another mission for you but you can have a drink first.\r\nPeach brandy is all that\'s left."\r\n\r\n"That\'ll be fine," Roy said. 

"I was never particular."\r\n\r\n"Then you\'re my man," Dr. Gar said, giving him a deep look, "because I\r\nwant you to go back in time and destroy humanity."\r\n\r\n"Whatever you say." 

Roy\'s training showed. "But if I may comment,\r\nwouldn\'t that be superfluous? Except for you and me the human race is\r\nfinished. We\'ve achieved our objective." He spoke without irony.\r\n\r\n"Never _my_ objective."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not a scholar and I mean no offense," Roy said, "but I believe it\r\nwas the co-ordinated spatial theory you announced back in \'06 that made\r\nit possible."\r\n\r\n"Misapplication," Dr. Gar said wearily, not wanting to go into it\r\nfurther for such an audience. Though, he thought, he\'d never have\r\nanother. "Come into my study and have your brandy."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"I still don\'t understand," Roy said later. He reached tentatively for\r\nthe bottle. When the old man made no objection he poured a second stiff\r\none.\r\n\r\n"You want me to go back in time and wipe out all human life," Roy said.\r\n"I assume you\'ll tell me when and where. All right. 

That would destroy\r\nour ancestors and so we\'d cease to exist, too. Wouldn\'t it be simpler\r\nto kill ourselves now? That is, if you see no point to our further\r\nexistence.

"\r\n\r\nOld Dr. Gar watched the other remnant of Earthly life twirl the brandy\r\nin the goblet. He looked at the viewscreen. It showed a panorama of\r\nrock dust and steam where Earth had been.\r\n\r\n"You forget that we have annihilated everything," Dr. Gar said, gazing\r\npensively at the screen. "Mankind, the animals, plant life and the tiny\r\nthings that creep the earth or swim the waters. Your mission will be\r\nmore selective."\r\n\r\n"Selective? How?"\r\n\r\n"You\'ll destroy man, but the rest will live. They may evolve into\r\nsomething better."\r\n\r\n"If you say so, Doctor." Roy\'s devotion to duty was a well-worn path.\r\n"Assuming you have the machine and I can operate it."\r\n\r\n"The machine is merely an attachment. It will plug into the instrument\r\npanel of your spacecraft. It operates automatically."\r\n\r\n"Good enough. You always were a whiz at these things. How far back do I\r\ngo? And who do I kill?"\r\n\r\n"I want you to strafe the Ark, exercising care not to hurt any of the\r\nanimals," said old Dr. Garfield Gar.\r\n\r\n"Noah\'s Ark?" Pilot Officer Roy Vanjan asked. "You mean during the\r\nFlood?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'ve computed it exactly. You won\'t have to worry about getting\r\nthere at the wrong time."\r\n\r\n"You mean after the forty days\' rain, so I\'ll have good visibility.\r\nGood-o." He agreed readily and he\'d do as the doctor said, of course,\r\nbut he permitted a trace of skepticism in his inflection and a\r\nsearching look into his goblet.\r\n\r\n"No, not the fortieth day," Dr. Gar said, "but in what we are told was\r\nthe six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of\r\nthe month. The animals need dry land. I have it all figured out.

"\r\n\r\n"I hope so. I mean I\'m sure you have. You\'re the doctor, of course, but\r\nwasn\'t there some doubt about the accuracy of the old Book? I didn\'t\r\nknow you were a fundamentalist."\r\n\r\n"Am I not the repository of all human knowledge?" Dr. 

Gar asked. He was\r\nnot a bit angry with Roy Vanjan. "Am I not the last best hope? 

Has not\r\nall else failed us?"\r\n\r\n"Well, sure--"\r\n\r\n"Did not the Noahic Covenant, under which human government was\r\nestablished, fail? Has not Japhetic science been our undoing?"\r\n\r\nRoy looked lost. "I\'m no scholar, Doctor."\r\n\r\n"Agreed. But perhaps you\'ll grant that I am?" He looked with supreme\r\ncalm at the young pilot. "I\'m your new intelligence officer and you\'re\r\nmerely my striking arm. Help yourself to another brandy, son."\r\n\r\n"Maybe I\'d better not. I don\'t want to goof the mission."\r\n\r\n"There\'s time. You\'ll want some sleep first."\r\n\r\n"All right. I suppose I\'ll need a steady hand to murder Noah and the\r\nrest."\r\n\r\n"And Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, and Noah\'s wife," said Dr. Gar, "and\r\nthe three wives of his sons with them, as it was written. Especially\r\nJapheth. 

But not the animals, remember."\r\n\r\n"I understand that. If you think the Ten Commandments don\'t apply.\r\nWhichever one of them it was."\r\n\r\n"They were an element of the Mosaic Covenant. It, too, failed. Perhaps\r\nthe Garic Covenant, if I may be so vain, will endure."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe waters covered the Earth.\r\n\r\nA moment ago, before he activated the attachment, Pilot Officer Roy\r\nVanjan\'s spacecraft had been plunging towards the vortex of a ragged\r\nball of dust and vapor, the destroyed Earth of World War V. Now, in the\r\nAdamic Year 601 (or was it the Edenic?--he couldn\'t remember, though\r\nDr. Gar had let him study the Book), the waters stretched everywhere.\r\nAhead the sun glinted in reflection from something rising above the\r\nsurface. Ararat?\r\n\r\nHe made out the twin peaks. He throttled back to scarcely more than\r\nmach one and flew over them, high. His second pass took him back along\r\nhis own vapor trail. This time he spotted the tiny surface craft making\r\nfor the solitary bit of land. He had to hand it to Dr. 

Gar. The old\r\nboy\'s space-time grid had hit it right on the button.\r\n\r\nRoy was too high to distinguish details but he imagined that Noah and\r\nhis family would be on deck, full of the wonder of Mount Ararat rising,\r\nas promised, from the sea.\r\n\r\nBut there was another wonder--the vapor trails that stretched for miles\r\nacross the upper air. Did they, down there on the Ark, think them a\r\nsign of the Lord? Roy smiled ironically. They were a sign of the lord\r\nGar and of his servant, Pilot Officer Vanjan, come to blast them into\r\neternity and change the future, to give the animals a chance.\r\n\r\nWho would chronicle his role as the re-arranging angel, the unheavenly\r\nhost about to gather up in violence the drifting souls below? Who,\r\nhe wondered. Some simian scribe? Some unborn elephant prophet? An\r\ninsectate scholar destined to evolve from among the creeping things\r\nthat would inherit the Earth?\r\n\r\nOr perhaps the written word would die unborn under the fiery hail of\r\nhis guns.\r\n\r\nNo matter. These questions and more had been anticipated by Dr. Gar.\r\nSoon now, at the end of Roy\'s strafing run, it would be up to History\r\nto begin assembling the answers.\r\n\r\nHe slowed to mach minus and sent out wings. He would have to dip close\r\nto see if the entire Ark\'s complement was on deck. 

The job had to be\r\ndone right or Earth was kaput. Nothing personal, Noah, old boy.\r\n\r\nThere they were, on the starboard side of the top deck, well out from\r\nunder the pitch of the roof, craning their necks for a look at this\r\nmiracle in the sky where they had expected to see only a returning dove.\r\n\r\n"Behold!" Roy cried out. "I bring you tidings! But not the tidings of\r\nthe dove. I am your lost raven returned--the raven of death! My tidings\r\nare of the new future which your descendants will not know and so will\r\nnot doom."\r\n\r\nThe frightened upturned faces were far behind and he was talking to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n"Hear me, Noah, for I am come to destroy you, and with you your seeds\r\nof self-destruction. These are the tidings I bring from the future that\r\nhas ceased to exist because you existed--the future that will exist\r\nonce more when you cease to."\r\n\r\nHe heeled the spacecraft over and back. No more speeches, he told\r\nhimself, though he had studied the Book in fascination. He was a\r\nkiller, not a philosopher.\r\n\r\nHe would have to make his strafing run low. If he dived on the target\r\nhis bullets would go into the holds and kill the animals. He roared at\r\nthe Ark a few feet above the waves.\r\n\r\nThey were all together in a clump, the eight of them.\r\n\r\nFarewell, Noah! he thought as his thumbs pressed on the death-dealing\r\nbutton. Farewell, Noah and Noah\'s wife!\r\n\r\nFarewell, Ham, and Ham\'s wife and unborn sons--farewell, Canaan, and\r\nCush, and Mizraim, and Phut!\r\n\r\nFarewell, Shem! And unborn Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and\r\nAram!\r\n\r\nAnd farewell, Japheth, father of sons of science! Farewell, Gomer, and\r\nMagog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras!\r\n\r\nFarewell, all tribes. Make way for the animal kingdom in the Garic\r\nCovenant.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe had made three passes and now he zoomed into the sky. He had\r\ndestroyed humanity and changed the future.\r\n\r\nOr had he? He\'d be dead, too, if he had, gone like the snap of a finger\r\nwith the last gasp from the Ark. He had killed his ancestors. He had\r\nkilled everybody\'s ancestors, but _he_ existed still. Where was the\r\nparadox that Dr. Gar had overlooked?\r\n\r\nThe Ark had drifted closer to the shore. He circled it and counted the\r\nlifeless bodies lying in red stains on the gopher wood of the deck.\r\nEight.\r\n\r\nThen he noticed the change. The backs of his hands were hairier. His\r\nshoes were binding him. When he kicked them off his agile toes curled\r\ncomfortably around the control pedals. He had a glimpse of a hairy,\r\nflat-nosed face reflected in the instrument panel. It laughed and the\r\nsound came out a simian yap.\r\n\r\nBut for all that he was still a sentient being. His control of the\r\nspacecraft was as expert as before.\r\n\r\nIt hadn\'t worked.\r\n\r\n_Do you hear, Dr. Gar?_ he thought. 

_It\'s a flop. I goofed the mission.\r\nWe\'re all dead, no matter what._\r\n\r\n_I give you a new commandment, man who would be God: Thou shalt not\r\ntamper with time._\r\n\r\nHe had changed the future and in the future he himself had been\r\nchanged, but not enough. Somewhere below in the hold of the Ark were\r\nhis ancestors who had evolved along a new path in the new future. The\r\nevolution had been slower, perhaps, but it had been as sure, external\r\nappearances notwithstanding. Somewhere in the far new future, he was\r\nsure, there was a simian Dr. Gar looking down in solitude on the\r\nremains of Earth.\r\n\r\nThe Ark had touched the land. The animals--his fellow creatures--were\r\nbeginning to go forth, two by two, onto the shore of Ararat.\r\n\r\nHis foescope set up a clamor. There in the sky was a new thing,\r\na spacecraft like his, yet unlike it. It looked deadlier, more\r\npurposeful. Ignoring him, it was diving out of the unknowable future\r\nto destroy its own past.\r\n\r\nHe watched in professional admiration as his fellow pilot screamed\r\nunerringly for the Ark in sacrificial completion of the mission he\r\nhimself had failed to accomplish. Death to the animals, too--from an\r\nanimal pilot.\r\n\r\nHe knew then that Earth would not die. It might circle lifeless for\r\neons, waiting to welcome the foot--or paw, or tentacle--of others from\r\noutside. But it would be there, intact and serene.\r\n\r\nEven as the mountain-shattering explosion came and he himself ceased to\r\nexist, he knew.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE SONS OF JAPHETH ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\xe2\x80\x99s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
