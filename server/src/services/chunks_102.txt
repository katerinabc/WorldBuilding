BUNCH\r\n\r\n                _The jag-stuff in those black rings was\r\n              wonderful, but why did they have to package\r\n                  it with so many extra accessories?_\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n             Worlds of If Science Fiction, February 1959.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.

]\r\n\r\n\r\nI had always said there was an easier way. 

And I think, when we invade,\r\nI\'ll be proved right. But you know how things get started, and how\r\npowerful tradition can be and how old-line thinking can keep people,\r\neven a whole planet, in a rut.\r\n\r\nThe big cargo saucers were getting bigger and bigger each year, what\r\nwith the growing popularity of the jag-whiff places, and the jag-whiff\r\nplaces themselves were growing in number with more and more people\r\ngoing "on the jag" because--well, partly because--of troubles in the\r\nsky, like strange balls whirling around and unexplainable objects\r\ngoing _beep_ and _wuff_ and _wuff wuff_. We of the saucers had slipped\r\npast these first baby objects O.K. 

and knew they were just little\r\nold harmless ping-pongs that chattered a little now and then like\r\na greeting going past. But tell the people that! They\'d throw a big\r\nglass on one of the whirlers and see spikes sticking out and maybe\r\na big pair of eyes inside and a nose and a long red tongue hanging\r\ndown. "The Earthits!" 

they\'d scream like they\'d just fallen into\r\none of the hot canals, and they\'d race off to a jag-whiff jag like\r\nJudgment-Day-of-Sins itself was after them. And the funny part of it\r\nis, I guess the people were right being scared like that, the way\r\nthings turned out.\r\n\r\nBut is it any wonder we were having to increase the size of the saucers\r\nto space-haul all that jag-whiff up through the rattleballs? And a big\r\nreason makes me think it could have been done more efficiently, we were\r\nhaving to take so much junk stuff, extra accessories I guess you\'d\r\ncall it, to get the jag-whiff. Our Earthit contacts were always giving\r\nus the old breeze about cost of labor, cost of materials, improvement\r\nin design and next year\'s inventories. Apparently the dealers didn\'t\r\nunderstand at all what the play was with us because they\'d give us\r\nso much blab-blab that didn\'t apply, all about futuristic design and\r\nabout how one jag-whiffer machine had it all over another jag-whiffer\r\nmachine, which to us didn\'t mean a thing. And we didn\'t talk, because\r\nwe\'d heard already how some Earthits feared the saucers, and how some\r\nEarthits said they didn\'t exist at all, and how some other Earthits\r\nwere on the fence, saying maybe they did maybe they didn\'t so what? and\r\nhow there was wide fear and great unrest among the Earthits in general.\r\nAnd when it\'s like that, and you\'re a possible source of the wide fear\r\nand unrest, a whole planet full of people can easily decide they don\'t\r\nwant any part of contributing to your pleasure.\r\n\r\nAnd that\'s what the jag-whiff was to us actually, pleasure. Back home\r\nwhen our troubles had us down, or maybe we just felt like raising\r\na little dust, we\'d go to a jag-whiff place. We\'d plunk down our\r\npay-pictures, and the whiff-tender would wheel out one of those black\r\nrings, which they have to keep under special pressures in our climate.\r\nThen he\'d screw on the tube with the face piece and we\'d take our\r\nwhiff and something out of the black ring--just seemed like real thick\r\nchest filler to me--would spread all through to the farthest reaches\r\nof our breath bags and go into our blood and suddenly all five of our\r\neye sticks would start whirling and focusing and zeroing-in for dames\r\nand our arms and legs would start a kick and a slap dance, enough to\r\nshake the planet down. And when our face spines and head tubes would go\r\ninto that special sharp buzz of contentment, we\'d know we were on our\r\njag, full and warm and happy with as much pleasure as any Martian is\r\never supposed to know. But we never revealed the play to our Earthit\r\ncontacts, just slipped in at night in our noiseless saucers with all\r\nlights dimmed, cleared our cargo tubes of the tons of pay-picture we\'d\r\nbrought (green copy of the Earthits\' currency) and took on as many of\r\nthe gleaming jag-whiffer machines as our cargo tubes would hold.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut it is ten years now since a jag-whiffer captain has steered his\r\nsaucer through the whirling balls. It got so the satellites would drum\r\non the saucer from a long way out. 

Deafening! 

Dreadful! We saw what\r\nwas coming and we tried to beat it. We saucered around the clock for a\r\nwhile trying to stockpile enough jag-whiff to last us. But of course\r\nwe couldn\'t. We are about out of it now, and our land is strewn with\r\nthe glittery shells that were once attached to the black tubes of the\r\njag-whiff.\r\n\r\nAnd it could all have been done so different. I\'m sure it could. That\r\nstuff wasn\'t just in the tubes of the jag-whiffer machines down there,\r\nI\'m convinced of that. That stuff may have been all around us down\r\nthere. 

I believe it was. But our government would insist we get into\r\nthese suits, about so far out, you see, about the time we\'d start\r\ncontacting the rattle balls. And they threatened us with removal of the\r\ncontacts if we broke the rules about the suits. In addition to that,\r\nthey said we\'d die anyway. So you see how life can be--grim and fuzzy\r\nand unsafe most of the time. And to make things even more uncertain,\r\njust because they couldn\'t duplicate the product we were hauling, our\r\nscientists got uppity and ignored the whole problem. Except to run off\r\nto the jag-whiff places of course to ease their frustrations, which\r\nthey did plenty often when they thought they wouldn\'t be seen.\r\n\r\nBut when we invade down through there, which we plan to do soon now,\r\nwith our special equipment to catch and explode the whirlyballs, I\r\nthink we\'re going to find out plenty. Among other things, I think we\'re\r\ngoing to find out that the stuff we cargoed up here at such great cost,\r\nthat was so inefficiently packaged, is all around us down there. I\r\nthink when we take over down there, with the right filtering equipment,\r\njag-whiffing may become as common and economical as breathing. And\r\nanother thing, I think we\'re going to find out we were taken for quite\r\na ride by the Earthits with their silly way of packaging jag-whiff.\r\nImagine having to buy all that chrome and steel, guaranteed to go over\r\none hundred miles per hour, just to get four little black rings of\r\nwhiff. And for all the Earthits talked about it, the rings with the\r\nwhite sidewalls didn\'t whiff one bit better than the others!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s In the Jag-Whiffing Service, by David R.

Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
