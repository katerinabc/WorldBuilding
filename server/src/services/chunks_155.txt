A. LOMBINO\r\n\r\n              It was no longer a question of theory, but\r\n                of money. Man could reach the moon, if\r\n            Saunders could persuade someone to finance him.\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n               Science Fiction Quarterly November 1951.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe laboratory was brightly lit, and four men in business suits\r\nsurrounded the large table. They stared down at the blueprints on the\r\ntable, some scratching their heads, others rubbing their chins in\r\nspeculation. The thin man in gray tweeds eyed them cautiously, his\r\nbreath coming in short, anxious rushes.\r\n\r\nThe big man at the head of the table adjusted his eyeglasses, his hand\r\nlingering on the rim for a second. Then he cleared his throat and said,\r\n"It won\'t work, Dr. Saunders."\r\n\r\nThe little man in gray tweeds darted impatient eyes at the man who had\r\njust spoken. "Why won\'t it work? 

Why not?"\r\n\r\n"It can\'t be done," the big man stated simply. "Maybe sometime in the\r\nfuture, but certainly not now."\r\n\r\nSaunders stretched a bony hand out from the cuff of his tweeds. "It\r\ncan be done," he said, slapping that hand on the table. "It\'s all\r\nhere. You\'ve just seen it; you\'ve studied it. Damn it, this isn\'t a\r\nfly-by-night affair! I\'ve worked on these plans for more than eight\r\nyears. 

I _know_ it will work."\r\n\r\nA man in blue serge shrugged and said, "I\'m afraid Bragg is right,\r\nDr. Saunders." He tugged at his collar, the fat hanging in loose folds\r\naround his neck.\r\n\r\nSaunders turned to eye the newcomer. "You agree?" 

he asked defiantly.\r\n"Even after studying my work? You agree that my proposed rocket\r\ncouldn\'t possibly reach the Moon?"\r\n\r\n"It might," the man in blue serge admitted, "but we can\'t speculate\r\non a thing of this nature. After all, Dr. Saunders, there\'ll be money\r\ninvolved and...."\r\n\r\n"Money!" Saunders snorted in disgust. "Is that all you\'re worried\r\nabout? You\'re one of the richest men on Earth, Mr. Peterson. How can\r\nyou let money stand in the way of what may well be man\'s greatest\r\nachievement?"\r\n\r\nBragg spoke again, peering from behind the thick lenses of his\r\neyeglasses. "Peterson is right; this thing would cost millions--more\r\nthan any of us would be willing to risk. We appreciate your considering\r\nus, but...."\r\n\r\nSaunders cut in sharply, "Does that go for all of you? 

Is Mr. Bragg\r\nspeaking for all of you?"\r\n\r\nA heavy silence crowded into the room. Saunders confronted Peterson\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"He speaks for me," Peterson said.\r\n\r\n"And you, Mr. Thorpe?" Saunders asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, I\'m inclined to agree," a balding man in glen plaid\r\nannounced.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Slade?" Saunders turned to a weasel-like man dressed in solemn\r\nblack.\r\n\r\nSlade nodded, his face chalky white against the black of his garb.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve asked you four men because you were probably the richest men\r\non Earth. I\'ve asked you because I thought perhaps you would see the\r\nsignificance of such a project. To reach the Moon." Saunders\' eyes\r\ngleamed with an intense light. "To reach the Moon."\r\n\r\n"And when we reach it?" Peterson asked. "Then what?"\r\n\r\n"Unlimited space," Saunders answered with feeling. "New worlds, worlds\r\nbeyond the imagination of man. The Moon is only the first step, the\r\nexperimental step. From there, Mars ... or Venus ... or a new solar\r\nsystem."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBragg said, "Rubbish. Even if this should work--I\'m not at all\r\nconvinced it will, but even if it should--what\'s on the Moon for us?\r\nBare crags and lonely craters. Cold, bleak atmosphere. 

Nothing."\r\n\r\n"Nothing that would bring in money, true," Saunders said. "But look at\r\nCopernicus and Galileo. Look at Pasteur and Edison and Curie. Look\r\nat ... oh, I could go on all night. What these men contributed to\r\nmankind can never be measured in terms of gold or silver. Can\'t you see\r\nthat?

"\r\n\r\n"Who wants to go to the Moon, anyway?" Thorpe asked, passing a hand\r\nover his bald head. "We\'ve got troubles of our own right here on\r\nEarth. Plenty to settle right here, man. Plenty. In a little while\r\nperhaps. Sometime in the future. Twenty, twenty-five years. But now,\r\nunthinkable."\r\n\r\n"We\'ve been saying that too long," Saunders snapped. "Now is the time!\r\nNot twenty or twenty-five years from now, but _right_ now! Science has\r\ngiven us the means; it\'s up to us to take the opportunity and use it."\r\n\r\n"It couldn\'t be done profitably," Peterson said drily.\r\n\r\n"Profitably," Saunders said bitterly. "Are your wars profitable?" he\r\nsuddenly shouted, bringing his bony fist crashing to the table top.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s not get violent," Slade said. It was the first thing he\'d said\r\nall night. Saunders somehow had the feeling that a corpse had spoken.\r\n\r\n"Exactly," he said, "Let\'s not get violent; let\'s spend some of the\r\nmoney that\'s been buying munitions and lives. Instead of razing cities\r\nto the ground, let\'s go up into the skies. Let\'s spend that money for\r\na project that\'s worthwhile. For once, forget the profit and think of\r\nthe meaning to mankind." He paused and his voice grew lower. "We\'ve\r\nbeen ravaged by too many wars, gentleman. Can\'t we stop this useless\r\nbutchery and devote our time and energy to something constructive?\r\nCan\'t we? I know my rocket will work. It\'s scientifically sound. I\r\nknow, too, that I can get a crew of scientists and technicians to take\r\nit to the Moon and back. All I need is the money and a little time.\r\nJust a little time."\r\n\r\n"There\'s a war going on, Saunders," Bragg reminded him. He had lit\r\na cigar with a gold lighter and was sitting now, puffing leisurely,\r\nblowing smoke at the ceiling.\r\n\r\n"I know," Saunders said. "Two wars in the past thirty years and now\r\nanother one. 

But consider this a moment. A trip to the Moon would\r\nprobably end all hostilities on Earth. It would probably unify this\r\nplanet as no other force has ever done. It will galvanize humanity into\r\nconstructive action. It will open new vistas that cannot possibly admit\r\nplans for war."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPeterson yawned openly. 

"Mmmm. I must say you\'re an idealist, Saunders.\r\nI doubt very much if anything short of a trip to the Sun would unify\r\nthe people of Earth." He chuckled a little at this and looked to the\r\nothers for approval.\r\n\r\n"That\'s right," Bragg agreed. "There\'ll always be wars, Saunders; the\r\nEarth is overpopulated, always will be."\r\n\r\n"More reason to find new worlds," Saunders said tiredly.\r\n\r\n"The only solution is war," Bragg insisted. "Survival of the fittest.\r\nForget your crazy ideas about new worlds. There\'s plenty of room right\r\nhere ... for the people who win.

"\r\n\r\n"And suppose we lose this time?" Saunders asked.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll never lose," Bragg said with certainty.\r\n\r\nSlade smiled a thin, wry smile. "Exactly, Bragg," he said. "As for me,\r\nwhenever people are ready to fight, I\'ll be ready to supply them with\r\nthe goods they\'ll need. In the meantime, the Moon can wait."\r\n\r\n"A year, maybe two," Saunders pleaded, "and the Universe will be open\r\nto us. Think of it, think of it...." Again his eyes lit with intense\r\nardor.\r\n\r\n"You think of it," Bragg said, "I\'m going home."\r\n\r\nThe other men nodded and began bustling into their overcoats. Saunders\r\nstood by helplessly, feeling his last ounce of strength seep from his\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n"Nice of you to think of us," Thorpe said cheerily. "Business is\r\nbusiness, though."\r\n\r\n"Yes," Saunders said quietly.\r\n\r\n"If you can figure a way to put a warhead on that rocket of yours,"\r\nSlade suggested.\r\n\r\n"Not a bad idea," Bragg admitted.\r\n\r\n"Well, Saunders," Peterson said, "we\'ve got to be running. No hard\r\nfeelings, of course; in fact, I wish you lots of luck." 

He chuckled\r\nagain and opened the door. 

"Good night."\r\n\r\nThe rest of the men filed out after him, nodding their farewells.\r\nSaunders watched them through the window of his laboratory, watched\r\nchauffeurs open the doors to long limousines, watched tail lights\r\ndisappear into the blackness of the night, little red pin-points\r\nemphasizing his failure.\r\n\r\nHe walked back to the table and sat, cradling his head in his arms,\r\nleaning on the blueprints of his ship.\r\n\r\n_All I needed was money_, he thought, _money and a little time. A year\r\nor two at the most. A year or two._\r\n\r\nSlowly he rose and brushed a thin hand over his wet eyes. There was\r\nwork to be done, and tomorrow was another day. He walked to the door\r\nleading to his inner laboratory and paused. It was past midnight, and\r\nbeing a punctilious person, Saunders ripped the day\'s page from the\r\ncalendar, exposing the new day to view. The new day was September 21st,\r\nthe year 3951.\r\n\r\nHe snapped off the lights and stepped quickly into the other room.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK REACHING FOR THE MOON ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
