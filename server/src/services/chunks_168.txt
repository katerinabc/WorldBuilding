So he asked the salesman to show him--\r\n\r\n                         The Obedient Servant\r\n\r\n                          By S. M. Tenneshaw\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Imagination Stories of Science and Fantasy\r\n                               June 1956\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThey quarreled at breakfast. 

This was not strange because they\r\nquarreled often. But it bothered him after he\'d called for his car and\r\nwas on the way to his office, he realized she was the only one left.\r\n\r\nThe realization came suddenly and now he was frightened--this strange\r\nman who needed friends as a spider needs flies--in order to survive.\r\nHis wealth had drawn them of course; a fact he refused to believe.\r\nBut even unlimited resources could not hold them and insult and abuse\r\ndrove them all finally away. Yet he continued to insult and abuse while\r\npainfully seeing them leave. Because that was the kind of man he was.\r\n\r\nUntil now they were all gone, the dear ones, the relatives, even the\r\nfawners and he realized in panic that only Dolores was left.\r\n\r\n_But she will stay. There is no cause to worry. She will stay because\r\nshe loves me because she married me._\r\n\r\nBut he was nervous. He knew this quarrel had to be patched up because\r\nhe had too much at stake. And knowing only one way to patch a\r\nquarrel, he frowned and pondered. A gift of course, but what? 

She had\r\neverything. Another diamond necklace? Another ruby ring? Somehow he\r\nfelt neither would do the trick this time. The quarrel had been very\r\nbitter.\r\n\r\nThen he remembered and smiled and told his chauffeur, "There is a store\r\nI noticed in the International Building. Kamiss and Company. Stop off\r\nthere...."\r\n\r\nHe marched into the richly decorated showroom and said, "I\'m John\r\nGardner of Gardner Industries. I understand you\'ve got something new."\r\n\r\nThe clerk almost snapped his spine bowing. John Gardner! 

Mr. Billions\r\nhimself! If he could get him on the customer list it would be a\r\ntremendous prestige boost. "Indeed we have, sir. 

I imagine you are\r\nreferring to our new unit--_Domestic Two_?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what you call it, but it\'s the servant-robot you people\r\nhave spent millions publicizing. Will it actually do what you claim?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. Our advertising was underplayed if anything. You see, Mr.\r\nGardner, robots have been found quite satisfactory for assembling\r\nwork--manufacturing operations and the like, where they functioned as\r\nmere automatons."\r\n\r\n"I know," Gardner said coldly. "I use seven hundred of them in\r\nsmall-parts assembly."\r\n\r\n"But only now has Kamiss been able to individualize the robot and endow\r\nit with a real intelligence. The process involved a new sensitizer\r\nwe developed. This device is motivated by a micro-wave control\r\nindividualized to the unit itself. The result, Mr. 

Gardner, is basic\r\nintelligence and unswerving devotion. Each unit is--"\r\n\r\n"You talk too much," Gardner growled with his usual tact. "Trot one of\r\nthe things out and let me look it over."\r\n\r\n"Certainly sir," and the clerk scurried away, fearful of offending this\r\npowerful man.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA few moments later, the drapes parted and a robot walked into the\r\nroom. Gardner scowled at it. 

He was disappointed. "Rather tall isn\'t\r\nit?"\r\n\r\nThe clerk, following close behind the robot, said, "True, but its\r\ndimensions are the result of exhaustive scientific research. The height\r\nis nine-feet-three and one-quarter inches, the arm-span six-feet-two\r\ninches. The body and the appendages are well padded with our new\r\n_Vino-Live Plasticene_--almost a flesh-equivalent. The hands you will\r\nnote, sir, are absolute masterpieces of human ingenuity. The unit can\r\npowder a rock or pick up a pin. Let me demonstrate."\r\n\r\n"It\'s about time," Gardner growled.\r\n\r\nThe demonstration was spectacular. The robot took a one-inch steel bar\r\nin its hands and formed a loop. It threaded an old-fashioned sewing\r\nneedle, then picked up a fragile vase and moved it tenderly across the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nThe clerk beamed with justifiable pride. "Tell the gentleman your\r\nqualifications, Raymond."\r\n\r\nThe robot looked at Gardner through two blue electronic eyes and said,\r\n"I can perform any task a human servant can perform. And I will be more\r\ndevoted and loyal than a human servant could possibly be. Your commands\r\nwill be obeyed without question. Your wishes will always be fulfilled\r\nto the limit of my power. You and you alone will be my god."\r\n\r\nThe salesman coughed apologetically. "A little flowery, I\'m afraid, but\r\nour advertising and sales engineers demanded it."\r\n\r\n"Where does the voice come from?"\r\n\r\n"Another Kamiss innovation. An ultrasonic selector draws the words from\r\na storage wire attuned to--"\r\n\r\n"Enough chatter. I\'ll take one.

"\r\n\r\nThe salesman beamed. "Where would you like it delivered, sir?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll take it with me. I plan it as a surprise gift for my wife."\r\n\r\nThe salesman\'s smile vanished. "Then perhaps you could bring the lady\r\nhere to our establishment--"\r\n\r\n"No," Gardner scowled. 

"Why should I?"\r\n\r\n"As I was endeavoring to explain, sir, the units are, of necessity,\r\ncompletely individualized. The controlling factor is the electronic\r\nwavelength of the owner\'s brain. As you know, the frequency of every\r\nhuman brain varies. No two are alike. That is the key to the whole\r\nconcept of _Domestic Two_. We--"\r\n\r\n"Will you quit babbling and get to the point!" Gardner bellowed. "Tell\r\nme in simple words why I can\'t take the robot with me!"\r\n\r\n"Because, sir," the clerk answered in a frightened voice, "to be of\r\nany value to your wife, the unit will have to be keyed to her brain\r\nfrequency."\r\n\r\nGardner stomped the floor. "Then you\'ve wasted my time. We can\'t do\r\nbusiness. My wife would never come down here."\r\n\r\n"But the adjustment takes only a few minutes--"\r\n\r\n"We had a quarrel, you fool! She won\'t even unlock her bedroom door for\r\nme. The whole idea of this thing was something to surprise her out of\r\nher anger and bring about a reconciliation."\r\n\r\nGardner was striding toward the door. The clerk was frantic. This sale\r\nwould have got him Company recognition. In desperation, he hurried\r\nafter Gardner.\r\n\r\n"May I make a suggestion, sir?"\r\n\r\nGardner turned. 

"All right--make it."\r\n\r\n"It occurred to me that you might have the unit attuned to your own\r\nfrequency--temporarily, that is. You could present it to the lady, then\r\nat her leisure, she could call here and have the frequency changed to\r\ncorrespond to her own."\r\n\r\nGardner scowled. "Well, why didn\'t you say that in the first place?\r\nHow long does this adjustment take?"\r\n\r\n"Only a few minutes," the clerk, said eagerly. 

"If you will just step\r\nthis way, sir. Come Raymond...."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRaymond sat hunched beside the chauffeur who was a trifle nervous. But\r\nthe chauffeur hid his agitation because John Gardner paid well and\r\nhad been known to discharge chauffeurs who displeased him and leave\r\nthem standing on street corners without jobs. Gardner ordered him to\r\nturn and go back home. As they rode, Raymond stared straight ahead, a\r\npleasant light glowing in his blue eyes.\r\n\r\nWhen the car stopped under the portico, Gardner said, "Get out and open\r\nthe door, Raymond."\r\n\r\nThe robot said, "Yes, master," and obeyed instantly.\r\n\r\nThe chauffeur, shouldered aside by the robot, looked worried. Gardner\r\nnoted this and enjoyed adding to the man\'s discomfort: "Maybe they\r\nbuild one that can drive a car. In that case I won\'t be needing you\r\nmuch longer."\r\n\r\nInside, the robot gently lifted Gardner\'s coat from his shoulders,\r\nhung it in the closet, then returned to Gardner\'s side. "Have you any\r\nfurther wishes, Master?"\r\n\r\n_Aladdin\'s genie come true_, Gardner thought, and amused himself for\r\na few minutes putting the robot through a series of grotesque duties.\r\nAmazing! Perhaps he would get one of these units for himself also.\r\n\r\nThen he turned his mind to Dolores. She was no doubt still in her room.\r\nBut this new toy would make her forget their quarrel all right. He\r\nvisualized her laughing interest. He could already see her clapping her\r\nhands like the child she was and rushing into his arms.\r\n\r\nGardner turned to the robot. "Raymond, go up the stairs and knock on\r\nthe first door to your right. It is your mistress\' room. Tell her I\'m\r\nwaiting. 

Bring her to me."\r\n\r\nThe robot nodded and Gardner thought a look of adoration glowed in its\r\neyes. It said, "Yes Master," and moved toward the stairs.\r\n\r\nGardner sat down. He smiled to himself, anticipating the reunion.\r\nIt wasn\'t every wife whose husband could go out and buy her a\r\nthirty-thousand-dollar toy.\r\n\r\nThere was the crash of rending wood. The sound chilled Gardner, froze\r\nhim so that the angry scream that followed was anticlimax. But it\r\nbrought movement back into his legs and he lunged toward the stairs. He\r\nbellowed an order.\r\n\r\nToo late. The robot was already descending. It carried the dead body of\r\nDolores in its steel arms. Her head hung limply on a horribly twisted\r\nneck.\r\n\r\n"She refused to come, Master," the robot said.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE OBEDIENT SERVANT ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
