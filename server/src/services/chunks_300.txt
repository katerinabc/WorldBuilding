]\r\n\r\n\r\nMy wife don\'t believe me. That\'s why she made me come here, and I\r\ndon\'t think you\'re gonna believe me, either, but it\'s the God\'s honest\r\ntruth--and the money\'s mine.\r\n\r\nHell, I wouldn\'t never steal. I know there\'s a lotta fellas in my fix\r\nthat do, but not me. I always been honest, and always got along okay.\r\n\r\nExcuse me, but are you takin\' this down just the way I\'m tellin\' it?\r\nCuz I can\'t talk so good, ain\'t had much schoolin\', and I want this\r\ntook down just like I\'m tellin\' it, cuz it\'s gonna he hard enough to\r\nbelieve.\r\n\r\nOkay, thanks.\r\n\r\nThe whole thing started yesterday mornin\'. I went out early cuz my wife\r\nwas sick and I wanted to try and get as much as I could by myself, in\r\ncase there gonna be doctor bills. And it\'s a lot tougher goin\' it\r\nalone, counta my wife plays the banjo, and that\'s a big help.\r\n\r\nWell, the subway take on the way up from Brooklyn was pretty poor, so\r\nI got off at Columbus Circle and headed for the Park. I figgered, it\r\nbein\' the Fourth of July holiday, there\'d be pretty good pickin\'s there.\r\n\r\nBut hell, I never figgered it was gonna be _that_ good!\r\n\r\nI had a little trouble gettin\' acrost Fifty-ninth Street--you know,\r\nwhere they been doin\' all that diggin\'?--and I took a bad spill there.\r\nMy crutches slipped on that damn gravel they got spread all over the\r\nplace. I don\'t usu\'ly have trouble navigatin\' that way, but this\r\nmornin\' I was still kinda sleepy and wasn\'t watchin\' myself enough.\r\n\r\nYeah, I went right on my ear--that\'s how I got this cut here. As if I\r\nain\'t had enough trouble there.\r\n\r\nThis real nice guy come runnin\' over and helps me up. He talked real\r\nfunny, sorta with his teeth, like. I couldn\'t make out a thing he said.\r\nA furriner, I figgered.\r\n\r\nThen when we get to the curb, he takes off like a bat outta hell into\r\nthe park. That\'s when I noticed he was dressed kinda funny, too. 

Like\r\nthe creases on his pants was on the _sides_, and his jacket was on\r\nbackwards, and he didn\'t have no shoes on. Just some kinda floppy red\r\nsocks, it looked like, with a lotta yella tassels on \'em.\r\n\r\nMust be a character from the Village, I figgered. I seen a lotta queer\r\nducks down there in my time.\r\n\r\nThen I forgot about him, cuz I spotted a coupla young kids sittin\' on\r\nthe stone bench near the gate, and they looked like a good touch. So I\r\ndusts off my hat and gives \'em a try.\r\n\r\nBut they was still lookin\' pop-eyed towards the park where the funny\r\ncharacter went, and didn\'t give me a tumble atall. So I moved along\r\ninto the park, and to hell with \'em.\r\n\r\nThere was only a coupla bums sleepin\' on the benches near the gate, and\r\nI went on up the grade and around the bend. It was slow goin\' uphill,\r\nand my leg was hurtin\', but when I fin\'ly got there, all the benches on\r\nboth sides of the walk was empty.\r\n\r\nI thought, Hell, I\'m _too_ early. But I kept on goin\', even though my\r\nshoulders was startin\' to hurt now. I didn\'t wanna grab a rest till I\r\ntook in a coupla bucks, at least.\r\n\r\nThe ground levels off there, and it was easier goin\', so I tried to get\r\nup a little speed, rememberin\' there was a place up ahead where people\r\nalways sit on the grass and get the sun.\r\n\r\nAnd all the way, the benches was empty and not a soul in sight\r\nnowheres. I was thinkin\' maybe there was some kinda celebratin\' goin\'\r\non and I oughta been goin\' up towards the Mall. But I knew it was too\r\nearly for anythin\' like that, so I kept on goin\'.\r\n\r\nAnd a damn good thing I did. Cuz when I reached that big field--you\r\nknow, where the road cuts off?--there was a fair-sized crowd standin\'\r\naround there.\r\n\r\nThey was all lookin\' off towards the middle of the field. But I\r\ncouldn\'t make out from where I was what was goin\' on, and I didn\'t care\r\nmuch, anyways, cuz I don\'t care nothin\' \'bout them parades and stuff.\r\nSo I just started makin\' my rounds.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWell, it was the damndest thing I ever seen! All them people started\r\nshellin\' out soon as I came up to \'em--without even lookin\' at me! I\r\nthought I was gonna pass out right there, seein\' all them green-backs\r\nfloppin\' into my hat.\r\n\r\nOne guy threw in wallet and all!\r\n\r\nLookin\' at these crazy people, I seen they was all talkin\'. And they\r\nlooked like they was talkin\' to theirselves, cuz nobody turned a head,\r\njust kept starin\', all glassy-eyed, like they was doped up.\r\n\r\nThe old guy that threw in his whole wallet was sayin\' somethin\'\r\nlike: "This is the finest performance of scar-laddy I\'ve ever heard.\r\nPositively brilliant!" There was a skinny kid standin\' next to the old\r\ngent, and his lips was movin\' fast. 

"Jeepers!" he was sayin\', "real\r\ndixieland." And his buddy was standin\' there, tappin\' his feet and\r\nyellin\', "_Hear_ that boogie beat! Man! That\'s Albert Ammons and Pete\r\nJohnson at their best!"\r\n\r\nA little ways in, a fat guy, standin\' on somebody\'s panama hat, says,\r\n"Show-pan! I just _love_ show-pan." His big, flabby lips was slappin\'\r\ntogether hard. The big, chesty old lady with him had one o\' them little\r\nwrinkled-up mouths, and I could hardly make out what she was sayin\',\r\ncuz her lips didn\'t hardly move at all when she talked, but it was\r\nsomethin\' like, "Chambah music, my deah. _So_ lovely.

"\r\n\r\nEv\'rybody\'s mouth was goin\'--ev\'rybody I looked at was sayin\' somethin\'\r\nabout music. And they all looked like they was havin\' the time of their\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nAnd they kept right on shellin\' out as I moved along through \'em!\r\n\r\nThen I gets to the edge of the crowd, and I spot what they\'re all\r\nstarin\' at--it\'s nobody but my old friend, Queerpants, the nice guy\r\nthat helped me on Fifty-ninth Street when I took that spill!\r\n\r\nHe\'s standin\' out there in the middle o\' the field with his back to\r\nthe crowd, wavin\' his arms around like crazy. Looked just like he was\r\nleadin\' a band. Queerest thing I ever seen--cuz there ain\'t nothin\' in\r\nfront o\' him, exceptin\' trees and grass.\r\n\r\nA coupla minutes later, he throws his hands down, like he\'s stoppin\'\r\nsomethin\', and then he turns around towards the crowd and bends over\r\nreal low.\r\n\r\nAnd the crowd goes nuts. Their mouths are wide open, screamin\' and\r\nyellin\', and they\'re clappin\' their hands like they was at a circus or\r\nsomethin\'.\r\n\r\nQueerpants bends over a couple times more, then he swings around again,\r\nsorta taps the air in front o\' him, stretches his arms up over his head\r\nfor a second, and then starts slingin\' \'em around again.\r\n\r\nRight away, everybody shuts their traps and goes to starin\' again.\r\nThey all look like they been cryin\'--but happy like.\r\n\r\nI\'m standin\' there, tryin\' to figger how maybe it\'s some kinda gag, and\r\nthere\'s maybe a band hidin\' back in the trees or somethin\' like that,\r\nwhen outta the corner o\' my eye I spots this cop comin\' towards me.\r\n\r\nI ducks back into the crowd real fast and starts stuffin\' all the dough\r\ninto my pockets. Soon\'s the hat\'s empty, I takes a peek back through\r\nthe crowd, and there\'s the blue-coat, rockin\' back on his heels with a\r\nbig grin spread on his fat face.\r\n\r\nThis, I hadda see, so I moves over, real quiet like, and his mouth is\r\ngoin\' like sixty. "It\'s the old Killarney," he\'s sayin\', "Bejasus!\r\nOi\'ve niver heard the like. Me poor old mither should be here now. God\r\n_bless_ the man!

"\r\n\r\nAnd all the time, the crowd\'s gettin\' bigger and bigger. Cars stop\r\nalong the road, a couple people ride over on horses, two women with\r\nbaby carriages pushes in, and a big guy with glasses, carryin\' about\r\nten books, drops them on the grass and starts clenchin\' his fists.\r\n\r\nNow I see Queerpants is takin\' a bow again, and ev\'rybody\'s beatin\'\r\ntheir hands.\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden, Queerpants jumps around and takes off towards the\r\nwoods, hoppin\' across the grass like a rabbit, and wavin\' his arms\r\naround again as he goes.\r\n\r\nLucky I\'m on the outside, or I woulda been trampled. It was like\r\nsomebody yelled "Fire!" 

in a movie. The whole mob beats it across the\r\ngrass, knockin\' into each other, ev\'rybody tryin\' to get ahead.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI let \'em go and went back to the sidewalk. I know where that woods\r\nlets out; it leads right back to Central Park West, and it\'s the long\r\nway around. I can easy beat \'em by goin\' up the sidewalk.\r\n\r\nAnd I do. I\'m already waitin\' outside when Queerpants comes hoppin\' out\r\nwith the whole mob runnin\' after him. Looks like they picked up lots\r\nmore people on the way, cuz now there\'s hundreds followin\' him.\r\n\r\nI damn near chokes when Queerpants jumps the red light. But traffic\r\njust stops dead for him, brakes jammin\' up and down the street for\r\nabout a mile.\r\n\r\nHe\'s headin\' straight crosstown towards the river, it looks like, and\r\nI\'m thinkin\', damn, this I gotta see. But I can\'t figger no way to\r\ncatch up with \'em.\r\n\r\nThen I see the traffic on the other side of the street is startin\' to\r\nturn right in after the tail-end o\' the mob. And the same thing starts\r\non my side, ev\'rybody tryin\' to go down that side street at the same\r\ntime. And ev\'rybody punchin\' their horns like crazy.\r\n\r\nAbout four cars down from where I\'m standin\', there\'s a taxi in the\r\nline. So, neat as you please, I goes down, opens his door and climbs in.\r\n\r\nThe cabby don\'t even see me. In his mirror, I can see his face is red\r\nas a beet, and he\'s yellin\' and cussin\' and beatin\' on his hornbutton.\r\n\r\nWell, I pulls the door shut and make myself comfy. Then, all of a\r\nsudden, we start movin\'. As we cut around the corner, I see how we got\r\nour break--there\'s two cars locked bumpers in the other lane, holdin\'\r\nup the whole line.\r\n\r\nNow we\'re goin\' straight crosstown at a pretty good clip. At Amsterdam,\r\nwe swing uptown, up a big hill, and when we get to the top, I can see\r\nthe crowd still racing along like mad.\r\n\r\nWay uptown, somewhere near a Hundred and Twenty-fifth, we turn west,\r\nrun down under the Express Highway, and end up in front of a beat-up\r\nold dock.\r\n\r\nThere\'s hundreds of cars parked all over the place with their doors\r\nopen and their engines runnin\', and ev\'rybody\'s racin\' toward the river.\r\n\r\nMy driver was out before the cab hardly stopped. It took me a little\r\nwhile to get out. 

Then I had to be real careful navigatin\' that old\r\nwharf. It was full of holes and big cracks and piles of junk lyin\'\r\naround.\r\n\r\nSlow goin\'. I was pretty beat by the time I reached the mob near the\r\nend o\' the wharf.\r\n\r\nThey was two long lines of \'em, movin\' along slow. Up ahead, they was\r\nall goin\' up a big red ramp that went up into the air off the dock and\r\ninto a great big thing that was hangin\' in the air over the river. The\r\nthing looked like a big banana made outta glass.\r\n\r\nWhen I got nearer, I could see right into the thing.\r\n\r\nInside it, there was a lotta little stalls, and people was all crowdin\'\r\ninto \'em, about four or five to a stall. As soon as they got in, a\r\nkinda door dropped down and I couldn\'t see no way that they could get\r\nout.\r\n\r\nBut it didn\'t look like anybody was _tryin\'_ to get out.\r\n\r\nThere was a big round table in each stall, with a lotta food on \'em,\r\nand the people was standin\' around just eatin\' like pigs in a sty.\r\n\r\nAll the time I was watchin\', people kept pilin\' into the thing, lookin\'\r\nlike they was singin\' their heads off. Some was clappin\' their hands\r\nand throwin\' their arms around, like they was doin\' some kinda dance.\r\n\r\nFor about an hour, people kept marchin\' up that ramp, until fin\'ly the\r\nend of the line came, and they all got in--exceptin\' the last one. A\r\nreal skinny old man with a cane.\r\n\r\nJust as he got up to the top of the ramp, the hole in the side of the\r\nbanana closed up, quick as a wink.\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden, the thing starts to go straight up into the air,\r\nleavin\' the old man standin\' there at the edge of the ramp, wavin\' his\r\ncane.\r\n\r\nNext thing the old man goes over the edge and drops into the river.\r\n\r\nThe banana-lookin\' thing keeps goin\' up into the air, goin\' faster and\r\nfaster, and shinin\' like a mirror. Smaller and smaller it gets, and\r\nthen--bop--it\'s gone.\r\n\r\nGoin\' back to the street, I was feelin\' sick. 

It was like ev\'rybody in\r\nthe world was crazy except me. I felt _lonesome_.\r\n\r\nAnd all those cars, parked ev\'ry which-way, with their doors open and\r\ntheir motors runnin\'--it was real scary.\r\n\r\nWell, I got outta there as fast as I could go and took the subway home.\r\nAnd my wife wouldn\'t believe me when she seen all that dough.\r\n\r\nBut it\'s the truth, and I figger the only reason they didn\'t get me,\r\nwhoever they was, is because I\'m stone-deaf and couldn\'t hear that\r\nguy\'s funny music.\r\n\r\nDo I get to keep the money, Yer Honor?\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ROUND-UP TIME ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!)

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\xe2\x80\x99s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
