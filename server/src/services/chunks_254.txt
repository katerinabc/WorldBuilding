Just make a few holes\r\n    in nothing at all--push some steel beams through the holes--and then\r\n    head for the hills. But first, read what happened to some people who\r\n    really did it._\r\n\r\n\r\n        HOLES\r\n     INCORPORATED\r\n\r\n By L. Major Reynolds\r\n\r\n\r\nThe red-headed secretary asked, "Names, please?"\r\n\r\n"Ted Baker.

"\r\n\r\n"Bill Stephens."\r\n\r\n"To see H. Joshua Blair. We have an appointment."\r\n\r\n"It\'s for three-thirty. We called up two weeks ago."\r\n\r\nThe secretary said, "Oh, yes. I have you on the list." She checked them\r\noff, studied them vaguely, asked, "What was it you wanted to see Mr.\r\nBlair about?"\r\n\r\nTed Baker held out the small steel box he was carrying. "About this."\r\n\r\n"Ah--what is it?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s a box."\r\n\r\n"I can see that," the redhead snapped. "What is it for? 

What does it\r\ndo?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s for construction work. It makes holes."\r\n\r\nThe girl sighed. It was late in the day and she didn\'t care much,\r\nreally. She snapped an intercom button. An inquiring voice rasped at\r\nher. She said, "A Mr. Baker and a Mr. 

Stephens to see you."\r\n\r\nEvidently it was all right because she snapped off the button and\r\npointed to a door. "In there."\r\n\r\nThey went in the door and faced a desk large enough to play tennis on.\r\nThe man behind the desk gave them a cordial snarl. "Well, what have you\r\ngot on your mind? And don\'t take all day to tell me."\r\n\r\nTed extended the box. "This. We\'d like to sell it to you."\r\n\r\n"What is it? A bomb?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir. It makes holes. It makes holes real quick."\r\n\r\nBlair scowled at the box. "What the hell do I want of holes?"\r\n\r\nBill Stephens came forward with further explanation. "You see, sir, Ted\r\nand I are inventors. We make, well--things. We\'ve been working on this\r\ninvention in our basement and it seems to be a success."\r\n\r\n"We don\'t quite know why it\'s a success," Ted said, "but it is."\r\n\r\n"We\'d like to demonstrate it for you."\r\n\r\n"Well, go ahead and demonstrate."\r\n\r\nTed raised the box and aimed it horizontally at nothing in particular.\r\nHe pressed a black button. There was an odd whirring noise. He took his\r\nhand off the button and lowered the box.\r\n\r\n"What are you waiting for?" Blair growled.\r\n\r\n"Nothing. That\'s it. 

I\'ve made the hole."\r\n\r\n"Are you two crazy? What kind of a fool trick--?"\r\n\r\nTed reached down and took a pencil off the desk. "May I borrow this?"\r\nWithout waiting for permission, he put the pencil carefully into the\r\nplace he\'d pointed the box. Half the pencil disappeared. He took his\r\nhand away. The part of the pencil still in sight didn\'t come with it. It\r\nstayed where it was, lying in thin air, horizontally, with no apparent\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nH. Joshua Blair goggled and turned three shades whiter. "Wha-wha-what\r\nthe hell!"\r\n\r\n"And now, if you\'ll try to move the pencil, the demonstration will be\r\ncomplete."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLike a man in a trance, Blair got up from his desk and grasped the\r\npencil. It wouldn\'t move. 

He got red in the face and threw all his\r\nweight on it. It would neither pull nor push. It stayed where it was.\r\nFinally Blair backed away from the thing. He leaned on his desk and\r\npanted.\r\n\r\n"You see," Ted said, "The hole goes into the fourth dimension. There\'s\r\nno other explanation. And the fourth dimension holds solider than\r\nconcrete."\r\n\r\nOld Blair\'s head was spinning, but business instinct came quickly to his\r\nrescue. "What happens," he asked, "if something in the third dimension\r\nis in the way?"\r\n\r\n"It gets out of the way," Bill said.\r\n\r\nTed demonstrated. He trained the box on the visible remains of the\r\npencil. It vanished.\r\n\r\nBlair said, "Well, I\'ll be damned!"\r\n\r\n"We figure this will save you a lot of money in construction work," Bill\r\nsaid. "You can get along without riveters. You just have a man put holes\r\nin girders with this and push the rivets through. You also make holes\r\nfor the beam-ends, and your entire building will be anchored in the\r\nfourth dimension."\r\n\r\n"Do it again," Blair said.\r\n\r\nTed made another hole and put another pencil into it. Blair grasped the\r\npencil and applied leverage. The pencil snapped at the point it entered\r\nthe next dimension but the broken end of the far piece was not to be\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nBlair asked, "You say you two invented this gadget?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s right," Bill said. "We\'ve got a workshop in my basement. We\r\ninvent in the evenings after we come home from work."\r\n\r\n"What do you work at?"\r\n\r\n"I read gas meters. He\'s a clerk in a supermarket."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you want money for this thing."\r\n\r\n"We\'d like to sell it, yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"How much do you want for it?"\r\n\r\n"Well, we don\'t know. What\'s it worth to you?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing probably. Leave it here a few days. I\'ll look it over and let\r\nyou know."\r\n\r\n"But--"\r\n\r\n"And don\'t call me--I\'ll call you.

"\r\n\r\n"But--"\r\n\r\n"Leave your address and phone number with my secretary."\r\n\r\nAfter Ted and Bill left, Blair yelled, "Get me Jake Steadman in the\r\nengineering department!" He didn\'t bother using the intercom, but his\r\nsecretary heard him anyhow.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTed and Bill went to work on an idea they had for the treatment of\r\nleather. You dipped your shoes in a solution and they lasted forever.\r\nThe thing didn\'t work too well, however. It was full of bugs. They tried\r\nto eliminate the bugs and once in a while they thought of H. Joshua\r\nBlair.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think it\'s about time he called us?" Ted asked.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be so impatient. He\'s a big man. He owns a big company. It takes\r\ntime."\r\n\r\n"He\'s had over a month."\r\n\r\n"Relax. We\'ll hear from him."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother week passed, and another, until one evening Ted came galloping\r\ninto the workshop with news. "That big new addition to the City Hall!\r\nThey\'re working on it! H. Joshua Blair Construction Company. A big sign\r\nsays so!"\r\n\r\n"Relax. You\'ll blow a tube.

"\r\n\r\n"Relax hell! He\'s using our invention to put up the steel girders. Just\r\nlike we suggested to him. Guys with boxes like ours making holes and\r\nputting in rivets!"\r\n\r\nBill stopped what he was doing. 

"He said he\'d call us. Maybe he forgot.\r\nMaybe we better go see him."\r\n\r\nThey both knocked off work the next day and got to Blair\'s office at\r\nnine o\'clock. The red-headed secretary said, "You\'ll have to make an\r\nappointment."\r\n\r\n"Appointment hell!" Ted headed for the inner door. Bill followed him.\r\nThey went into H. Joshua Blair\'s office to find him in conference with\r\ntwo vice-presidents. Ted said, "Mr. Blair, we came--"\r\n\r\n"Who in the devil are you?"\r\n\r\n"You remember us. Ted Baker and Bill Stephens. We came about our\r\ninvention."\r\n\r\n"What invention?"\r\n\r\n"Our hole maker. You\'re using it on the City Hall addition."\r\n\r\nBlair glowered. "Where\'d you get the idea it was yours? Have you got any\r\npatents to show?

"\r\n\r\n"Well, no. We didn\'t--"\r\n\r\n"I did! Fourteen good solid patents. You two better go peddle your\r\ngroceries.

"\r\n\r\n"Now look, Mr. Blair."\r\n\r\nBlair raised his voice. "Throw these two bums out!"\r\n\r\nThree huskies appeared as by magic to do Blair\'s bidding. As Ted and\r\nBill landed on the sidewalk, one of the vice-presidents said, "Do you\r\nthink that was smart, H. J.? They might cause trouble.

"\r\n\r\nBlair snorted. "They haven\'t got a prayer. A meter reader and a grocery\r\nclerk!"\r\n\r\n"We could have at least given them a few hundred."\r\n\r\n"Not on your life. Never give a sucker an even break, Jim. Give them\r\nanything at all, we acknowledge their claim. That\'d be stupid."\r\n\r\n"Maybe you\'re right."\r\n\r\n"Of course I\'m right. It\'s business. Now about those other bids. By gad!\r\nWe can run every contractor in town out of competition! They can\'t touch\r\nour prices!"\r\n\r\nOut on the sidewalk, Bill and Ted sat mournfully looking up at the vast\r\nsteel skeleton, held together literally by their own genius. Ted said,\r\n"We got a raw deal."\r\n\r\n"Maybe we had it coming. We were pretty stupid."\r\n\r\n"Anything we can do?

"\r\n\r\n"Doesn\'t look like it."\r\n\r\n"Maybe the leather solution will turn out."\r\n\r\n"Maybe." Bill looked wistfully up at the steel skeleton. "At even a cent\r\na hole, we\'d have done all right.

"\r\n\r\n"Let\'s go home and get to work."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the Mighty and Benevolent Kingdom of Szkazia, a minor reign of terror\r\nexisted. The King, tired of complaints from his subjects, had just\r\nfinished dressing down his Prime Minister. The Prime Minister was\r\npassing the abuse on to his Chief Scientist. "If something isn\'t done\r\nsoon, I won\'t be responsible for your head, my friend. The King is in a\r\nrage."\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the Chief Scientist watered--partly from fear, and partly\r\nfrom nights and days spent in his laboratory beating out his brains on\r\none idea after another.\r\n\r\n"I\'m doing my best, sire--"\r\n\r\n"It\'s not good enough! These steel girders coming out of nowhere!\r\nBanging people in the head--whacking them in the stomach! Why it isn\'t\r\nsafe to walk through the halls of the Administration Building. Even the\r\nbedrooms of the Executive Apartments are not safe! The other night the\r\nDirector of Propaganda had just gone to bed--"\r\n\r\n"I know of the incident," the Chief Scientist said hurriedly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you do? But you\'ve done nothing about--"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been working hard," the scientist said patiently, "and I think I\r\nhave the solution. Give me another day.

"\r\n\r\n"One day, then. After that--" The Prime Minister made a significant\r\nslicing motion with his finger.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister chewed his fingernails and watched the clock. Sleep\r\nwas out of the question with the King calling up every little while\r\nyelling for action. The Minister counted the hours and presented himself\r\nat the Royal Laboratories precisely twenty-four hours later. "Time\'s\r\nup," he snapped.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Scientist was wiping his face. There were new lines around his\r\nmouth. 

He indicated a small steel box. "I think I\'ve got it," he said.\r\n"Come with me."\r\n\r\nThey went swiftly to the Administration Building. "This should be close\r\nenough. We depress this lever and--and hope."\r\n\r\n"Well, do it--do it!"\r\n\r\nThe Chief Scientist pushed the lever on the steel box. A whirring sound\r\ncame from within. All the steel girder ends in sight--all the nasty\r\nlittle rivets--disappeared. The Chief Scientist smiled and wiped his\r\nface again. "It worked," he said.\r\n\r\n"Excellent. I\'ll see that you get a medal."\r\n\r\n"Thank you," the Chief Scientist said sadly. That was the trouble with\r\npeople nowadays. They either handed you a medal or your head.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTed and Bill stared sadly at the mess around the City Hall. Bill said,\r\n"It\'s a good thing it collapsed at night so nobody was killed, isn\'t\r\nit?"\r\n\r\n"You said it. I\'d have felt guilty if there\'d been any casualties."\r\n\r\n"What do you suppose went wrong?

"\r\n\r\n"You got me. What do you think they\'ll do to old Blair?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, but it looks pretty bad. They refused to let him out on\r\nbail."\r\n\r\n"Serves him right. The way he treated us."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got it wrong. He treated us swell. He did us a big favor. We\r\ncould have been blamed for this."\r\n\r\nBill thought it over before saying, "I guess you\'re right. I hadn\'t\r\nlooked at it that way."\r\n\r\n"Let\'s go home and get to work on the leather solution."\r\n\r\nSo they did.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _If Worlds of Science Fiction_\r\n    September 1952.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\xe2\x80\x99s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
