Prepare to take notes now in preparation\r\n    for your final exam on the subject Alien Creatures and Their Actions\r\n    in Given Situations. Notice below us the female of the dominant\r\n    Species. She is with her child...._"\r\n\r\nClutching Robbie in her arms and holding him tight, Helen Thompson\r\nsat down wearily on the ground. The cold and dampness was all around\r\nher, boring through the thin cotton dress she wore. Her flesh was cold\r\nand her dark brown hair hung in ringlets over her forehead. She wore\r\nno shoes. She had lost them miles back, near the ruins at the edge of\r\nChicago. Her feet were blistered and bleeding, numb now from the cold\r\nof early morning.\r\n\r\nCarefully she put her sleeping child on the ground for a moment as she\r\nrubbed her feet trying to restore circulation. Slowly feeling came back\r\nand then she flinched as pain shot up her legs.\r\n\r\nShe picked up the child and started again, heading westward.\r\n\r\n    "_See the way she tries to protect her young, cradling it in her\r\n    arms, shielding it from the coldness with her own body._"\r\n\r\nNow the sun was higher in the sky. The cold was gone now. But still\r\nthere was something surrounding her, enclosing her, almost like a\r\nprison wall. Yet she could not see it.\r\n\r\n_Radiation!_\r\n\r\nRadiation from the long exploded bombs. It poisoned the air. It killed\r\nall vegetation. It killed all the animals. All except the two of them,\r\nthe woman and her child. It had spared them. 

Not because it wanted to,\r\nbut because it had to. Vaguely she remembered....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShe and Robbie had been sitting in a Chicago park when the first\r\nbomb dropped. It fell quite near them, about three miles away. She\r\nremembered the bright blinding flash. Above them the branch of a tree\r\ncracked. It fell to a point twenty feet over their heads. Then it\r\nstopped. It was as if some force held it back. The force, whatever it\r\nwas, also held back the heat. But it didn\'t stop her from fainting in\r\nterror.\r\n\r\nWhen she regained consciousness, the burned and broken city lay all\r\naround them. Buildings were fused together. Everywhere was destruction.\r\nEverywhere except around she and Robbie. There, the grass was green and\r\nflowers grew. At the edge where the green ended and the black began,\r\nthere was a pile of rubbish piled up _as if leaning against something_.\r\nShe picked up a stick nearby and threw it. It reached the point where\r\nthe green stopped and then it too stopped, _in the middle of the air_.\r\nFinally it fell to the ground.\r\n\r\nShe arose and walked over to where the stick lay. She extended her hand\r\na few feet in front of her, and touched something. 

Something tangible,\r\nyet she could not see it. And no matter how hard she pushed, she could\r\nnot extend her hand beyond a given point.\r\n\r\n_A dome was covering them and protecting them!_\r\n\r\nFor weeks she and Robbie stayed under the dome while the wind took some\r\nof the radiation away. Each morning, when they awoke, a package of food\r\nlay by their side. Strange food, food they had never tasted or seen\r\nbefore. _Alien food._\r\n\r\n_They had been spared by--what?_\r\n\r\nThe puzzling thoughts spun in her mind. _Why_ were they being spared?\r\n_Who_ was sparing them?\r\n\r\nThen one day, weeks after the bombs dropped, the dome disappeared. She\r\ncould not see it disappear, but she knew that it was gone for the pile\r\nof ash that had leaned against it fell to the ground.\r\n\r\nThen she started out with but one thought in mind. _I must find\r\nJohnny!_ Across country she went, through small towns filled with death.\r\n\r\nShe walked, with Robbie stumbling along at her side, his small face\r\nwide with wonder and fear. Her heart ached as she looked into his\r\nstaring eyes, while an occasional whimper left his lips. "... mommy,\r\nwhere\'s Daddy? Where is he, mommy?"\r\n\r\nShe gripped his hand tighter and continued to walk, each mile a numb\r\nand crazy nightmare.\r\n\r\n    "_Now take note of the setting the aliens are in. It took careful\r\n    planning for our scientists to devastate the planet\'s surface as\r\n    you now witness._"\r\n\r\nIt was late afternoon when Helen stopped to rest by a seared oak tree.\r\nRobbie had been walking beside her. Suddenly he turned and looked up at\r\nher. 

"Mommy, why are we walking so far? I\'m tired of walking. I don\'t\r\nwant to walk any more. Where is daddy?"\r\n\r\n"Hush, dear. We\'re going to find daddy." She knew they would never find\r\nhim ... alive. But something made her keep going. Something inside\r\nwouldn\'t let her turn back. _She had to know...._\r\n\r\n"We\'ve got to find daddy so he\'ll make everything right again, don\'t\r\nwe?"\r\n\r\nShe hesitated before answering. "Yes--yes that\'s it. We\'ve got to find\r\ndaddy so he can help us--and make everything right again!"\r\n\r\n"Oh."\r\n\r\n"Go to sleep, Robbie. You\'ve got to rest."\r\n\r\n"But I\'m hungry."\r\n\r\n"Sleep, dear. We\'ll eat ... 

later." She kissed him, sat on the ground\r\nbeside him and rocked his head in her weary arms.\r\n\r\n    "_For those of you students who do not understand the languages of\r\n    this planet, I\'ll interpret. She was trying to comfort her young\r\n    one, telling him that his father was going to make everything right\r\n    again when they found him. While inwardly she knew they would never\r\n    find him alive. Primitive peoples often react to disasters in this\r\n    way, making themselves and others around them believe things that\r\n    are not true._"\r\n\r\nSlowly Helen opened her eyes. She sat up slowly, taking in the scene\r\naround her. She sat that way for a moment, thinking, her mind far from\r\nthere, somewhere in southern France where her aunt and uncle were. She\r\nwondered if--\r\n\r\n"Robbie," she whispered. She nudged his shoulder gently, trying to\r\nawaken him. Finally his eyes opened. He smiled wistfully.\r\n\r\n"Get up, dear. We\'ve got to be going now."\r\n\r\n"I\'m hungry."\r\n\r\n"I know. So am I. We\'ll find something to eat pretty soon. You will\r\nhave to wait.

"\r\n\r\n"But--" Tears came to his eyes. One ran down his dirty cheek, making a\r\nrivulet.\r\n\r\n"Please Robbie," she pleaded. "Don\'t cry. Remember what daddy always\r\nsaid, \'A smile blocks up the tears.\'" He smiled weakly. "Now buck up,"\r\nshe added.\r\n\r\nShe took his hand and they started walking.\r\n\r\n    "_Reading her mind, I see that she is more concerned over her\r\n    child\'s welfare than her own. This is very unusual in primitive\r\n    races._"\r\n\r\nThey entered a small town. 

Down the main street they walked. The town\r\nwas deserted, but showed no sign of being bombed or burned. In the\r\nstreet, numerous automobiles were parked. But she saw no people....\r\n\r\nThey entered a restaurant. Inside, the tables and chairs were in good\r\norder except for a half inch of dust and a few dirty dishes. She\r\ninspected the kitchen and found what she had been looking for. Canned\r\nfood.\r\n\r\n"Robbie," she called. "Where are you?"\r\n\r\nShe walked back to the door of the kitchen and looked into the\r\nrestaurant. Robbie was not there.... Then she saw him through the\r\nrestaurant windows, standing on the street outside. She called\r\n"Robbie--I\'ve found some food!"\r\n\r\nRobbie turned, his small face twisted with hunger. He started back\r\ntoward the door.\r\n\r\nShe returned to the kitchen and looked for a can opener.\r\n\r\n    "_We will drop down a few hundred feet and pick up the young one\r\n    with our magnetic-force-field. We shall examine him._"\r\n\r\nOne moment Robbie was standing at the restaurant door, and the next\r\nhe was floating upward in the middle of the air. There was a strange\r\nsensation in his stomach. He was scared. He started to cry.\r\n\r\n    "_Notice the noise he makes with his mouth. This is not a form of\r\n    communication, but rather he is using a primitive form of expressing\r\n    his thoughts, which is called crying. Reading his mind, I find only\r\n    confusion and fear. He wonders where he is, but knows that he\r\n    doesn\'t like it._\r\n\r\n    "_Another interesting fact about these aliens is that they feel\r\n    pain. It is hard to understand and even harder to explain. 

But I\r\n    will try. We are aware of touching something or somebody only as a\r\n    sensation on the skin. These people have more than that. Now watch.\r\n    As I cut the skin of this young one slightly, notice that he jerks\r\n    and screams louder. He is feeling pain. It is a strong sensation\r\n    that leaves a sharp impression on the brain. That does not fully\r\n    explain it, but it is the best I can do along with this\r\n    demonstration._"\r\n\r\n"Oh, good God! Robbie! 

What happened, honey. 

What happened?" Then she\r\nsaw the blood dripping on the floor. "_Robbie_, your arm!"\r\n\r\nThen he was in her arms, sobbing hysterically. "I--I ... they took me,\r\nand cut me--and ..." but he could go no further.\r\n\r\nCarefully, she laid him on a table and examined his arm. The bleeding\r\nhad subsided some. She took a clean wet cloth and wiped off the blood.\r\nThen she bandaged it.\r\n\r\nRobbie had stopped sobbing now, but the tears were still coming. She\r\ntried to get the story of what had happened to him, but what she did\r\nhear, she didn\'t believe.\r\n\r\nAfter he finished she said, "Now, Robbie, I can\'t believe that you were\r\nlifted into the air by a space-ship, tied to a table and cut in the arm\r\nby some monster!"\r\n\r\n"But Mommy, that\'s what happened. 

Honest! And when I was laying on the\r\ntable I heard them talking. But I couldn\'t understand what they were\r\nsaying!"\r\n\r\nA grimness filled her as he spoke. 

And then a terrible horror spread\r\nthrough her. She remembered the Chicago park, when the bombs fell--how\r\nthey alone seemed to be spared death.... _Was it possible?..._\r\n\r\nShe grabbed Robbie into her arms and dashed up the street away from the\r\nrestaurant. She saw a car standing by the curb and ran to it. There\r\nwere keys in the ignition. She put Robbie on the front seat and got\r\nin. As the motor coughed into life she meshed gears and sped out of\r\nthe town. 

One thing buzzed in her mind. _Peoria--that\'s where Johnny\r\nis--oh, Johnny--help us!_\r\n\r\n    "_The conveyance in which you now see them is called an automobile.\r\n    It is propelled by a liquid fuel, gasoline, in an internal\r\n    combustion engine. We purposely had the automobile left there for\r\n    them._"\r\n\r\nShe drove through the industrial section of Peoria. She knew she was\r\nnear the factory where Johnny worked. She started looking for the\r\nbuilding, thinking how unfair it was for Johnny to have taken a job\r\nso far from Chicago. But her heart lifted as she thought about her\r\nhusband. _Johnny--Johnny, we\'re here!_\r\n\r\nThere! To her left. 

There it was! She stopped the car, took Robbie\'s\r\nhand and ran toward the building.\r\n\r\n"Mommy, is this where daddy is? Is he here?" Robbie\'s voice trembled.\r\n\r\nShe nodded her head as they ran. "Yes, Robbie--daddy\'s here!"\r\n\r\nShe reached the building. The door was open and they stepped inside.\r\n\r\nShe was breathless now. Johnny--so close.... She led Robbie to the\r\nstairs and her knees shook as they went up. "Johnny! Johnny!" she\r\ncalled, her voice close to hysteria.\r\n\r\nBut there was only silence.\r\n\r\nShe ran down the hall on the second floor, pulling Robbie with her,\r\nheard him sobbing. Then she saw the door and the gold letters on it.\r\nJOHN THOMPSON.\r\n\r\n"Robbie, stay here." She hesitated. Her hands were cold and clammy. She\r\nwas trembling.\r\n\r\nShe shoved open the door.\r\n\r\nShe screamed.\r\n\r\nThere on the floor lay a body. It had once been a man. Now there was\r\nonly a skeleton of bleached white bones. Then she saw _it_. On the ring\r\nfinger of his right hand. A gold ring with silver letters on black\r\nonyx. Johnny\'s....\r\n\r\nThen she was running and screaming. Screaming and running. Down the\r\nstairs and out the door. Behind her Robbie followed, crying, terror in\r\nhis small eyes.\r\n\r\nShe collapsed on the ground, her body shaking with sobs. Robbie fell\r\nbeside her.\r\n\r\nShe put her arms around him, clutched his body to her. "Oh, Robbie,"\r\nshe cried. "You\'re the only thing I have left in the world. I love you.\r\nDon\'t leave me. Don\'t ever leave me." She snuggled him closer to her.\r\n\r\nThen she looked at his face. She gave a little cry in her throat. She\r\nlooked closer. Covering his skin were small red sores. What was it she\r\nhad once read in a book?--Something about radiation poisoning--red\r\nsores appearing just before death--\r\n\r\n"No, Robbie! Oh, no!

"\r\n\r\nHe looked up at her, his eyes hot and feverish. He tried to talk but\r\nthe words bubbled on his lips.\r\n\r\nShe pressed him to her breast and rocked him, shaking her head. "No,\r\nRobbie! Don\'t leave me!..."\r\n\r\nShe felt the beating of his heart against hers. Slower. His small body\r\ntwitched. Then grew silent.\r\n\r\n... She sat there on the ground, holding the still form in her arms\r\nlong after the sun had set. The Moon shone down with a silver glow,\r\nbathing the child\'s dead body in its soft light. It shone in the\r\nwoman\'s eyes too, glazed eyes, with a dead mind behind them....\r\n\r\n    "_That concludes our lesson for today._"\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK LESSON FOR TODAY ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\xe2\x80\x99s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
