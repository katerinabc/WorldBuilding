There was a smell\r\nof nervous excitement in the air and Max\'s hand trembled as he fumbled\r\nwith the buckles. 

Thinking back on it, the whole morning had been like\r\nthat. Nervous and excited.\r\n\r\nRight after breakfast, Max had given me a good bath and loaded me in\r\nthe car. I always like to ride in the car and this time Max even\r\nallowed me to stick my head out the window. He doesn\'t usually let me\r\ndo that, but I was too engrossed in the exhilarating rush of air to\r\npay any attention to the change of routine. When we drew up in front\r\nof a large brick building a multitude of strange and peculiar odors\r\nassailed my nose, tantalizingly anonymous. Max\'s big hand caught me\r\nbefore I got halfway through the window. 

That disgusted me, because I\r\nwanted to investigate the funny smells, and I pouted all the way into\r\nthe building. As the events of the next hour progressed I got madder\r\nand madder.\r\n\r\nFirst there was the doctor, poking around in my mouth, stabbing my\r\neyes with a blinding beam of light, and prodding and squeezing my\r\nbody. It reminded me of the day I came to live with Max and I was\r\ntempted to take a hunk out of this doctor\'s hand like I did the other\r\none. 

But Max was there and that stopped me. I didn\'t want to see the\r\nhurt look that would come to his eyes every time I did something\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\nAfter the doctor finished Max led me into a gleaming white room where\r\nI was surrounded by a gushing mob of women dressed in white uniforms.\r\nTheir "Ohs!" and "Ahs!" 

and "Isn\'t he beautiful!"--I\'m not beautiful\r\nand I detest the description--put the finishing touch to what had once\r\nbeen a wonderful day. I flopped to the floor, trying to ignore them.\r\nThen, indignities of indignities, one of the "girls" tried to pick up\r\nmy eighty pounds of blue-gray masculinity. That was the last straw!\r\n\r\nI let out a deep-throated growl, and sprang clear of her encircling\r\narms. Fangs bared, ears flat against my head, I must have presented a\r\nterrifying appearance to the women, because they fled to all corners\r\nof the room, squealing and bleating like a bunch of sheep.\r\n\r\nFor the fun of it, I made a short dash at the one who had tried to\r\npick me up. With a high-pitched scream she slumped to the floor in a\r\ndead faint. I could hardly keep from laughing as I turned to search\r\nfor a new victim. About this time Max came barging through the door\r\nand grabbed me by the scruff of the neck, putting an end to my fun. He\r\nwasn\'t mad, although he pretended to be, and I could detect the humor\r\nin his voice while he scolded me.\r\n\r\nBack in the car again, Max roared with laughter while patting me on\r\nthe head and saying, "You old devil, you!" in that special way he has\r\nwhen amused at something I\'ve done. When he finally got control of\r\nhimself, he started the car and drove in the direction of the funny\r\nsmells. As the smells got stronger, I began to get uneasy. Looking at\r\nMax, I sensed that he was uneasy too. "What was going on?" I wondered\r\nas the car dipped down a ramp and entered a dimly lit cave where the\r\nsmells became overpowering.\r\n\r\nThe cave was jammed with huge tank-trucks and that was where the\r\nstrange smells were coming from. I don\'t know what was in the trucks,\r\nbut Max said something about nitric acid and hydrozine fuel when he\r\nnoticed my interest in them. Leaving the car, we walked down a short\r\npassage branching off the cave, climbed a couple flights of stairs and\r\nemerged in the bright sunlight. I nearly yipped in surprise as I\r\ncaught sight of the over-grown thing beside me. It looked for all the\r\nworld like a giant cigar that had been cut in half and stood on end.\r\nThere were still three or four trucks around the base of the thing and\r\na kind of fear spread through my mind. The magic of the strange smells\r\nwas gone and here, at close quarters, the smell was raw and\r\nuninviting.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMax led me to a group of men and they talked for a few minutes. I\r\ndidn\'t pay much attention to what they said until one of them, a big\r\nman with a lot of stars on his shoulder, reached down and patted my\r\nback. "Better get him loaded," said the Starman. "Only ten minutes\r\ntill blast-off."\r\n\r\nMax led me to a kind of open-air elevator and started up the side of\r\nthe gleaming monster. At the top Max put me into a padded cage inside\r\nthe cigar, fastened the straps, and patted me. Then he was gone and a\r\nlarge door slid into place, leaving me in vile smelling, pitch\r\ndarkness. I lay there quietly, but the uneasy feeling kept getting\r\nworse. A sudden hissing noise nearly scared me to death; then I\r\nremembered my training. The hissing was only air, the same as had been\r\nin the cage at home, and wouldn\'t hurt me. Even so, I struggled\r\nagainst the straps, trying to reach them with my teeth. Nothing doing\r\nand again I lay quiet--waiting.\r\n\r\nI must have dozed off because the next thing I knew my cage was\r\ntrembling violently and a powerful roaring dinned in my ears. This\r\nlasted only a second, then something crushed my body flat in the cage.\r\nMy legs grew heavy and a racking, tearing pain ripped at my muscles. A\r\nblack film blotted out the lighter blackness of my cage.\r\n\r\nI don\'t know what happened in the interval, but when I came to the\r\nroar was gone and my body felt like it was floating in the air. My\r\nhead felt swollen and I experienced some difficulty in swallowing. I\r\ncouldn\'t hear a thing except the hiss of air and I was suddenly\r\novercome by the feeling that I was a long way from home.\r\n\r\nSlowly I became aware that my body was regaining its weight. The cage\r\nwas becoming quite warm now and I licked my nose, wishing for a cold\r\ndrink of water. Suddenly I was jerked against the straps and I forgot\r\nall about my other troubles. The jerks didn\'t hurt me as much as they\r\nscared me. I had experienced somewhat the same thing when Max hit the\r\ncar brakes hard, but he wasn\'t here to pat me reassuringly.\r\n\r\nThe cage was getting real hot now and the jerks were coming with\r\nincreasing frequency. The air had stopped too and I desperately wanted\r\na drink. The last thing I remember before the crash was wishing that\r\nMax would open the door and let me out like he always had at home.\r\n\r\nMax\'s gentle voice sounded a long way off. "Good boy!" 

he kept\r\nrepeating. 

"Good boy!" I couldn\'t find the strength to open my eyes so\r\nI just lay quietly and listened to the talk, thankful that the smell,\r\nthat had penetrated the entire day, was gone now.\r\n\r\n"I was afraid that those parachutes wouldn\'t cut the speed enough to\r\nget him down alive," said the Starman who had patted my back earlier.\r\n\r\n"No sign of radiation," said a strange voice. "His blood count is\r\nnormal and he isn\'t hurt physically unless there are internal\r\ninjuries.

"\r\n\r\n"What about his weakness?" asked Max, patting me.\r\n\r\n"You\'d be weak too, if you had been through the ordeal he has," said\r\nStrange-voice. "He\'ll get over that soon and live to father a good\r\nmany space-puppies."\r\n\r\nStrange-voice was absolutely right in his forecast and it\'s with\r\npardonable fatherly pride that I lead each new family to the great\r\nstone monument which reads: "_In honor of Rex, a German Shepherd dog,\r\nwho pioneered man\'s first flight into outer space._"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PIONEER ***\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!)

Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\xe2\x80\x99s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
