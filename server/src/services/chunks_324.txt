copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe man who discovered that the world was flat, after all, was an\r\nAustralian hermit named Herbert Fitzgrone. He was a thoughtful man with\r\na glass eye and a metal plate in his head, both obtained during the\r\nBoer War. In the bush shanty where he had lived for forty years, he\r\nstudied the riddle of the universe.\r\n\r\nOne day, shortly after he had turned sixty, he made his astonishing\r\ndiscovery. He went to Sydney, and found his way to the office of the\r\neditor of the _Sydney Sun_. He opened the door and went in. "The world,\r\nsir," he said simply, "is flat."\r\n\r\nThose historic words were the first inkling of the scientific storm\r\nthat was to burst without warning on a complacently globular world.\r\nUnfortunately, the editor was not there to hear them. It was 11:00\r\nA.M., Pacific time, and the Sydney pubs were open. Herbert Fitzgrone, a\r\npatient man to whom years were as seconds, sat down in the empty office\r\nto wait.\r\n\r\nWhen the editor showed up at 4:35 P.M., he seemed a trifle confused.\r\nHe hung his hat on Fitzgrone\'s head, and sat down in the waste paper\r\nbasket. The man of science then stood erect and said it again. "The\r\nworld, sir, is flat."\r\n\r\n"That so?" 

said the editor. "You know, I always had a secret hunch it\r\nwas." He was an amiable man, with four children and a glass fountain\r\npen that flashed a light in the top when he used it. At that moment he\r\nwasn\'t quite sure whether Herbert Fitzgrone was alone or at the head of\r\na delegation.\r\n\r\n"I expected you to scoff," Herbert Fitzgrone said, a shade of\r\ndisappointment in his tone. "After all, when Columbus and Magellan said\r\nthe world was round, everybody scoffed. I came here prepared to be\r\nscoffed at."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like to scoff at anybody," the editor said. "I once scoffed at\r\na man in a pub, and he hit me in the eye."\r\n\r\n"Well, if you won\'t," the scientist said, vexed, "you won\'t. Anyhow,\r\nI want to show you my proof that the earth as a globe is a monstrous\r\nimpossibility. Look here." 

He spread out some sheets of paper on the\r\neditor\'s desk.\r\n\r\n"My," said the editor. "Impressive, all right. What is it?"\r\n\r\n"Trigonometry. Do you understand it?"\r\n\r\n"No, but I\'m very fond of it. All those big numbers and everything.\r\nVery impressive."\r\n\r\n"Well, my calculations prove that the earth couldn\'t be a globe,\r\nbecause two lines of latitude can\'t possibly be at the same level. Do\r\nyou realize what that means?"\r\n\r\n"My God," said the editor in awe.\r\n\r\n"Exactly! Suppose you had two ships in Sydney Harbor, one seven miles\r\nnorth of the other. According to the globular theory, the northern ship\r\nwould also be four miles higher!"\r\n\r\nThe editor lurched in his swivel chair. 

"Stop the presses!" he yelled\r\ninto the phone, as he had seen editors do in American films. "And get\r\nme the Hatson Line quickly!"\r\n\r\nHe waited for his connection. Then he said, "This is the editor of the\r\n_Sun_. Listen and listen carefully. 

Hold all sailings until further\r\nnotice! I\'ve just learned that the earth is flat! _Flat_, do you\r\nunderstand? God help the ships at sea!"\r\n\r\nHe hung up, wan and shaken. Then he rushed for the door to get the\r\nstory on the presses. 

He was already through the door when he made the\r\nodd discovery that it wasn\'t the door. It was the window, it was open,\r\nand his office was on the ninth floor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNothing more was heard of Herbert Fitzgrone after this tragedy.\r\nPresumably frightened that he might be held responsible for the\r\neditor\'s death, the scientist disappeared. Fortunately for posterity,\r\nhowever, he neglected to pick up the calculations he had spread out on\r\nthe editor\'s desk.\r\n\r\nThey were discovered by a vice-president of the Hatson Line, who came\r\nto the editor\'s office for further enlightenment. This gentleman made\r\na prolonged study of the papers--he was quick on the trig and a fast\r\nman with a digit. He came to the terrifying conclusion that Christopher\r\nColumbus had made a terrible mistake.\r\n\r\nHe immediately cabled the New York office, forwarding all figures\r\ndown to the last spherical triangle. The head of the New York office,\r\na patriotic man, promptly dispatched the whole thing to the State\r\nDepartment in Washington, marked "Top Secret." Five minutes later Drew\r\nPearson predicted darkly that the whole world would shortly find itself\r\nflat on its back.\r\n\r\nThe nation\'s top scientists were summoned to a secret and speedy\r\nconclave at the White House. The President put it squarely up to the\r\nscientists--was the world round, or wasn\'t it? And if it wasn\'t, what\r\neffect would a flat world have on the nation\'s defenses? Was this a\r\nboost for communism or democracy?\r\n\r\n"Speak up, boys," he said. "I haven\'t got all day."\r\n\r\n"Ridiculous, Mr. 

President," one scientist sneered. "If the world is\r\nflat, how do you explain that when you approach a mountain or ship at\r\nsea, you see first the summit or funnels?"\r\n\r\n"What you see depends upon the weather," a young scientist insisted.\r\n"If there are low clouds, you don\'t see the top first. Then again,\r\nwhat you see first often depends on what you _want_ to see first! 

It\'s\r\nconditioning. Have you ever made a conscious effort to see the bottoms\r\nfirst?"\r\n\r\nA little scientist with a high neck and a squint jumped up. "When a\r\npartial eclipse of the moon takes place, the shadow of the earth on\r\nthe moon is a circle. Only a ball-shaped object can throw a circular\r\nshadow, gentlemen!"\r\n\r\n"Poppycock!" scoffed a scientist next to him. "So can a flat disk.\r\nFurthermore, who is an authority here on what happens on the moon?\r\nMoon-gazing is guesswork, gentlemen--sheer guesswork!"\r\n\r\nA worried little bald man pleaded, "Why can\'t we reconcile these\r\nhostile theories of apple-shape and saucer-shape into a compromise\r\nconcept which will satisfy everybody?"\r\n\r\n"Exactly!" a ribald voice shouted. "Apple-saucer!"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Einstein?" said the President hopefully.\r\n\r\nThe great man rose wistfully. "I am sorry, Mr. President," he said\r\nmeekly. 

"But it is all over my head."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Flash," said Walter Winchell on Sunday night. "Attention, Mr. and Mrs.\r\nAmerica and all the ships at sea. I, Walter Winchell, want to tell you,\r\nwhoever you are, that I, Walter Winchell, am the first as usual to\r\nbreak the most sensational scoop of the century! I, Walter Winchell,\r\nnow tell you, whoever you are, that the world is no longer round, but\r\nflat. Flat, ladies and gentlemen ... F-L-A-T. 

Geography marches on! And\r\nthe very first baby to be born into this new flat world...."\r\n\r\nHearst papers promptly informed their readers that: REDS SABOTAGE\r\nGLOBE! The _New York Times_, with eminent fairness, editorialized:\r\n"It would seem that there is a great deal of justification for the\r\nnew theory that the world is flat, while on the other hand, it seems\r\nequally dubious that there is sufficient evidence for discarding the\r\nglobular theory which has had, we cannot afford to overlook, the\r\ndistinguished test of time."\r\n\r\nReaders of the _Daily Worker_ turned for the facts, as usual, to the\r\n_Herald Tribune_. The Communist Party suffered its usual crisis. One\r\ngroup contended that accepting the new theory would split the unity\r\nof the working class, diverting attention from the class struggle.\r\nThe other group bitterly maintained that to adhere to the discredited\r\nglobular theory would be a betrayal of Marx.\r\n\r\nThe latter lost. The result was a new splinter party called the True\r\nMarxists, which called a world rally to form the new popular front,\r\nthe Flat World Workers Party. On the other side of the barricades, the\r\nN.A.M. and American Legion denounced flat-worldism as an attack on the\r\nvery principles on which our great nation of free enterprise is founded.\r\n\r\nGabriel Heatter cried, "Ah, my friends, let\'s not be deceived! Let\'s\r\nnot be duped by this subtle attack on all that we hold dear, all that\r\nwe have learned in the little red schoolhouse, in cherished days gone\r\nby!"\r\n\r\n"This," Henry J. Taylor declared scathingly, "is the sort of thing we\r\nmight have expected in the worst days of the New Deal. What actually\r\nlies behind this subversive campaign to convince Americans that the\r\nworld is actually flat? Just this. Certain interests want you to\r\nbelieve that Columbus was wrong, that he made a mistake, when he\r\nsaid the world was round. If you swallow this, then you must believe\r\nhis discovery of America was also a fantastic mistake. Is any decent\r\nAmerican willing to concede that the founding of our great nation was\r\nnothing but a blunder?"\r\n\r\nThe Un-American Activities Committee immediately held hearings in\r\nWashington. Witnesses on all sides of the question were summoned.\r\nAmong those who testified were Herbert Hoover, Gabriel Heatter, Henry\r\nJ. Taylor, Thomas Dewey, Robert Taft, John Foster Dulles, Henry Luce,\r\nGerald K. Smith, Representative Rankin, Louis Budenz, Whittaker\r\nChambers, Elizabeth Dilling and Westbrook Pegler, who revealed that\r\nthe whole thing was a plot by Mrs. Roosevelt. Henry Wallace was also\r\ncalled, cited for contempt in the first five minutes, and thereafter\r\nthe proceedings went smoothly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe C.I.O. and the A.F. 

of L. held special conventions to consider\r\nwhat stand labor should take on the issue. Since they felt it had\r\nlittle bearing on wages, hours or the Taft-Hartley Act, they passed a\r\nresolution to remain neutral. Or, as one delegate put it, to live in a\r\nworld without shape.\r\n\r\nA wave of unrest swept over the country. Teachers went on record in\r\nfavor of a flat world, out of sheer boredom with trying to cram the\r\nopposite concept into the thick skulls of small fry. Shipping companies\r\nand airlines spent millions in paid advertising to fight the flat world\r\nidea. They feared that business would fall off if people got scared\r\nabout doing the same.\r\n\r\nThose who accepted the theory were stigmatized as "flatheads," and were\r\nexhorted in black ad headlines: "DON\'T BE A FLATHEAD!" This led to the\r\ncoining of the counter-epithet, "globephobe."\r\n\r\nM.G.M. announced it would produce "The Flat Earth," made by the same\r\nhands who turned out "The Good Earth." Warner Brothers promptly\r\npurchased a vehicle called "One Globe" to star Humphrey Bogart as\r\nColumbus, Lauren Bacall as Queen Isabella, and Paul Muni as the _Santa\r\nMaria_.\r\n\r\nThe controversy spilled over into the United Nations. Russia, which\r\ndiscovered that it looked more imposing on flat maps, demanded that\r\nall globe maps be destroyed under a death penalty for non-compliance.\r\nThe United States, out of habit, opposed this idea. Despite\r\n$3,567,219,483,128.50 rushed as a loan to Albania, Iceland and 72\r\nother nations, the U.N. vote went with the Soviet. As one Albanian\r\ngrumbled, "They didn\'t send Chesterfields--just Wings."\r\n\r\nRussia\'s victory had reverberations heard around the world ... or\r\nrather, along the sides of the world. Old geographies were burned.\r\nGlobe maps were broken in half and used for ashtrays. The flat map won\r\nthe international distinction of being referred to as the Moscow map.\r\nGlobetrotters were laid off by the lecture bureaus in droves. Universal\r\nPictures had the plane in its trademark sky-write the company\'s name\r\naround a terrestrial saucer.\r\n\r\nThe world could not exist half round, half flat, the President of the\r\nUnited States told Congress sadly. And since the rest of the world was\r\nflat, there was no help for it--America would have to flatten out, too.\r\nDespite globephobe cries of "Shame!" the famous 22nd Amendment was\r\nadded to the Constitution:--\r\n\r\n"The world shall, for all purposes of this Republic, be considered\r\nas flat. The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by\r\nappropriate legislation. Any article or any amendment which may contain\r\nany implication that the world is round is hereby nullified and\r\nrepealed."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow that the world is once more flat, unified and serene, I do not\r\nthink that there can be any serious consequences if I reveal the\r\nsequel to this historic development. It came about when the editor\r\nof a national magazine, at his wit\'s end for a strong piece to follow\r\nhis usual lead article of "Is Sex Here To Stay" or "How Sexy Are You\r\nSexually?", hit upon the notion of sending me to Australia to find the\r\nman who had discovered the earth was flat.\r\n\r\nIt took me months of searching through the outback to locate Herbert\r\nFitzgrone. He was still living in his bush shanty, and had just turned\r\neighty when I found him. I had great difficulty in persuading him to\r\ntell me the whole story, as he was totally absorbed in a new scientific\r\nstudy. He was on the verge, he told me jubilantly, of proving that\r\nthere is no such thing as gravity, and that Newton was an ass.\r\n\r\nWhen I persisted in knowing more about his original research that had\r\nexploded the globular theory, he smiled dryly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, _that_! Well, you probably know that I left all my calculations\r\nbehind in that editor\'s office. When I came back here, I decided to\r\nwork out a duplicate set. Well, sir, do you know what I discovered?\r\nThat old Columbus had been right all along! I\'d put the decimal point\r\nfor the algebraic equation of one plane triangle in the wrong place."\r\n\r\n"But that\'s impossible!" I burst out in horror. "Why, the whole world\r\nis flat now as a result of your calculations!"\r\n\r\n"You don\'t say," Herbert Fitzgrone chuckled. 

"Well, now!"\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MISTAKE OF CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\xe2\x80\x99s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
