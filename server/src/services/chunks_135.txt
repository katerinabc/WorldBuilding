It meant changing the habits and physical structure of\r\n    the immigrants, but that worked out fine. 

In fact, every possible\r\n    factor was covered--except one of the flaws of human nature...._\r\n\r\n\r\nDaptine is the secret of it. Adaptine, they called it first; then it got\r\nshortened to daptine. It let us adapt.\r\n\r\nThey explained it all to us when we were ten years old; I guess they\r\nthought we were too young to understand before then, although we knew a\r\nlot of it already. They told us just after we landed on Mars.\r\n\r\n"You\'re _home_, children," the Head Teacher told us after we had gone\r\ninto the glassite dome they\'d built for us there. And he told us there\'d\r\nbe a special lecture for us that evening, an important one that we\r\nmust all attend.\r\n\r\nAnd that evening he told us the whole story and the whys and wherefores.\r\nHe stood up before us. He had to wear a heated space suit and helmet, of\r\ncourse, because the temperature in the dome was comfortable for us but\r\nalready freezing cold for him and the air was already too thin for him\r\nto breathe. His voice came to us by radio from inside his helmet.\r\n\r\n"Children," he said, "you are home. This is Mars, the planet on which\r\nyou will spend the rest of your lives. You are Martians, the first\r\nMartians. You have lived five years on Earth and another five in space.\r\nNow you will spend ten years, until you are adults, in this dome,\r\nalthough toward the end of that time you will be allowed to spend\r\nincreasingly long periods outdoors.\r\n\r\n"Then you will go forth and make your own homes, live your own lives, as\r\nMartians. You will intermarry and your children will breed true. 

They\r\ntoo will be Martians.\r\n\r\n"It is time you were told the history of this great experiment of which\r\neach of you is a part."\r\n\r\nThen he told us.\r\n\r\nMan, he said, had first reached Mars in 1985. It had been uninhabited by\r\nintelligent life (there is plenty of plant life and a few varieties of\r\nnon-flying insects) and he had found it by terrestrial standards\r\nuninhabitable. Man could survive on Mars only by living inside glassite\r\ndomes and wearing space suits when he went outside of them. Except by\r\nday in the warmer seasons it was too cold for him. The air was too thin\r\nfor him to breathe and long exposure to sunlight--less filtered of rays\r\nharmful to him than on Earth because of the lesser atmosphere--could\r\nkill him. The plants were chemically alien to him and he could not eat\r\nthem; he had to bring all his food from Earth or grow it in hydroponic\r\ntanks.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor fifty years he had tried to colonize Mars and all his efforts had\r\nfailed. Besides this dome which had been built for us there was only one\r\nother outpost, another glassite dome much smaller and less than a mile\r\naway.\r\n\r\nIt had looked as though mankind could never spread to the other planets\r\nof the solar system besides Earth for of all of them Mars was the least\r\ninhospitable; if he couldn\'t live here there was no use even trying to\r\ncolonize the others.\r\n\r\nAnd then, in 2034, thirty years ago, a brilliant biochemist named\r\nWaymoth had discovered daptine. A miracle drug that worked not on the\r\nanimal or person to whom it was given, but on the progeny he conceived\r\nduring a limited period of time after inoculation.\r\n\r\nIt gave his progeny almost limitless adaptability to changing\r\nconditions, provided the changes were made gradually.\r\n\r\nDr. Waymoth had inoculated and then mated a pair of guinea pigs; they\r\nhad borne a litter of five and by placing each member of the litter\r\nunder different and gradually changing conditions, he had obtained\r\namazing results. When they attained maturity one of those guinea pigs\r\nwas living comfortably at a temperature of forty below zero Fahrenheit,\r\nanother was quite happy at a hundred and fifty above. A third was\r\nthriving on a diet that would have been deadly poison for an ordinary\r\nanimal and a fourth was contented under a constant X-ray bombardment\r\nthat would have killed one of its parents within minutes.\r\n\r\nSubsequent experiments with many litters showed that animals who had\r\nbeen adapted to similar conditions bred true and their progeny was\r\nconditioned from birth to live under those conditions.\r\n\r\n"Ten years later, ten years ago," the Head Teacher told us, "you\r\nchildren were born. Born of parents carefully selected from those who\r\nvolunteered for the experiment. And from birth you have been brought up\r\nunder carefully controlled and gradually changing conditions.\r\n\r\n"From the time you were born the air you have breathed has been very\r\ngradually thinned and its oxygen content reduced. Your lungs have\r\ncompensated by becoming much greater in capacity, which is why your\r\nchests are so much larger than those of your teachers and attendants;\r\nwhen you are fully mature and are breathing air like that of Mars, the\r\ndifference will be even greater.\r\n\r\n"Your bodies are growing fur to enable you to stand the increasing cold.\r\nYou are comfortable now under conditions which would kill ordinary\r\npeople quickly. Since you were four years old your nurses and teachers\r\nhave had to wear special protection to survive conditions that seem\r\nnormal to you.\r\n\r\n"In another ten years, at maturity, you will be completely acclimated to\r\nMars. Its air will be your air; its food plants your food. 

Its extremes\r\nof temperature will be easy for you to endure and its median\r\ntemperatures pleasant to you. Already, because of the five years we\r\nspent in space under gradually decreased gravitational pull, the gravity\r\nof Mars seems normal to you.\r\n\r\n"It will be your planet, to live on and to populate. You are the\r\nchildren of Earth but you are the first Martians."\r\n\r\nOf course we had known a lot of those things already.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe last year was the best. 

By then the air inside the dome--except for\r\nthe pressurized parts where our teachers and attendants live--was almost\r\nlike that outside, and we were allowed out for increasingly long\r\nperiods. It is good to be in the open.\r\n\r\nThe last few months they relaxed segregation of the sexes so we could\r\nbegin choosing mates, although they told us there is to be no marriage\r\nuntil after the final day, after our full clearance. Choosing was not\r\ndifficult in my case. 

I had made my choice long since and I\'d felt sure\r\nthat she felt the same way; I was right.\r\n\r\nTomorrow is the day of our freedom. Tomorrow we will be Martians, _the_\r\nMartians. Tomorrow we shall take over the planet.\r\n\r\nSome among us are impatient, have been impatient for weeks now, but\r\nwiser counsel prevailed and we are waiting. We have waited twenty years\r\nand we can wait until the final day.\r\n\r\nAnd tomorrow is the final day.\r\n\r\nTomorrow, at a signal, we will kill the teachers and the other Earthmen\r\namong us before we go forth. They do not suspect, so it will be easy.\r\n\r\nWe have dissimulated for years now, and they do not know how we hate\r\nthem. They do not know how disgusting and hideous we find them, with\r\ntheir ugly misshapen bodies, so narrow-shouldered and tiny-chested,\r\ntheir weak sibilant voices that need amplification to carry in our\r\nMartian air, and above all their white pasty hairless skins.\r\n\r\nWe shall kill them and then we shall go and smash the other dome so all\r\nthe Earthmen there will die too.\r\n\r\nIf more Earthmen ever come to punish us, we can live and hide in the\r\nhills where they\'ll never find us. And if they try to build more domes\r\nhere we\'ll smash them. We want no more to do with Earth.\r\n\r\nThis is our planet and we want no aliens. Keep off!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ March 1954.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
