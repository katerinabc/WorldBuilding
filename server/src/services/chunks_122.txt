]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt\'s still very clear in my mind. 

The whole episode. The afternoon\r\nvisit to Marsten\'s office, the trip to Mars, and the journey back.\r\n\r\nIt was one of those warm summer afternoons. All one craved for was a\r\npatch of green grass to recline on and maybe a faint breeze to tingle\r\none\'s forehead. I was sure of the grass and hopeful for the breeze.\r\nBut one of Marsten\'s messengers popped up and the grass and the breeze\r\nwould have to wait. After all, Marsten was my boss.\r\n\r\nHe had his office in the Empire State Building. Norbert Marsten was the\r\nowner of the Marsten Circus, the greatest, biggest, loudest circus in\r\nthe world. And if you don\'t believe it, ask Mr. Marsten.\r\n\r\n"Sit down, Nick," he invited, speaking from one corner of his mouth as\r\nthe other corner was busy chewing a dollar cigar. Marsten was a small\r\nman with sleek black, hair. A small man with big ideas.\r\n\r\nI sat down.\r\n\r\n"Nick, you\'re the best \'bring \'em back alive\' man I\'ve got. The best.

"\r\n\r\nThis was very true. "You\'ve got a job for me," I said.\r\n\r\n"That\'s correct."\r\n\r\n"So why the buildup? Tell me what you want."\r\n\r\n"I want something that no other circus has."\r\n\r\n"You must be kidding. You have every known animal there is. Why, the\r\nbushmaster I brought you two months ago is the longest--"\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t exactly an animal I want."\r\n\r\n"Oh? You mean you want a performer? What the hell have I got to do--"\r\n\r\n"What I want is out of this world."\r\n\r\n"A different kind of act? I still say--"\r\n\r\n"I want a Martian."\r\n\r\nI was glad I didn\'t have a mirror in front of my face. I could imagine\r\nhow foolish I looked with my mouth hanging open.\r\n\r\n"I even have a name picked out for him," Marsten persisted. "Marty, the\r\nMartian. What do you think of that?"\r\n\r\nI stood up slowly. "Let me know when you\'ve recovered."\r\n\r\nMarsten came around the desk. "Sit down. 

Now listen to me. Did you ever\r\nhear of a man named Hendrick Ritter?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"The greatest scientist in the world. He\'s been working for me for over\r\na year. I hired him to do one particular job for me: to concoct a fuel\r\nthat will get a space ship to Mars and back. Well, it\'s done. Did you\r\never hear of a man named Sam Young?"\r\n\r\n"Same answer as before."\r\n\r\n"He\'s a designer for air ships. The best in the business. 

He\'s finished\r\na job for me. And, Nick, it\'s already built. 

And I\'ve got Joe Roane\r\nworking for me."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve heard of him," I said.\r\n\r\n"The greatest pilot in the world," Marsten said.\r\n\r\n"The greatest this, the greatest that. And for what? 

Why, the ship\r\nprobably won\'t get off the ground."\r\n\r\nMarsten chewed furiously on his cigar. "But what if it does get off\r\nthe ground? What if it does get to Mars?"\r\n\r\n"All right. So what? How do you know there\'s life on Mars?"\r\n\r\n"There is. I hired the greatest--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," I groaned. "I believe you, I believe you. 

So now we\'re on\r\nMars."\r\n\r\n"You capture a Martian and bring him back."\r\n\r\n"What if he doesn\'t care to be captured?"\r\n\r\n"What do I pay you for?"\r\n\r\nI thought this out, then said, "To capture Martians."\r\n\r\n"Exactly."\r\n\r\n"You wouldn\'t settle for a moon maiden, would you? I heard they\'re\r\ncute. 

And sexy."\r\n\r\n"A Martian." He was very adamant. "I\'ll have the greatest attraction in\r\nthe world. Nick, I\'m the kind who gets what he wants. I\'ve spent over\r\nthree million dollars on this project and I\'m ready to spend another\r\nthree million. Just get me my Martian and you\'ll be a rich man. You\'ll\r\nbe rich enough to quit working for me and to tell me to go to hell.\r\nYou\'d like that, wouldn\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"I\'d like that very much."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwo weeks later we went to Arizona. A week after that we took off. I\r\ndidn\'t really think we would. But we did.\r\n\r\nJust me and Joe Roane. Two men in a space ship.\r\n\r\nA huge metal tube hurtling through the longest and blackest of nights.\r\n\r\nJoe Roane was a good-looking chap. Good-looking, young, and excited.\r\nHe was the first to pilot a ship to Mars. He was looking ahead to the\r\nglory that awaited him.\r\n\r\nWe landed on Mars.\r\n\r\nWe put on helmets that Ritter and Young had made for us. We stepped\r\ndown the metal ladder.\r\n\r\nThey were there, waiting for us.\r\n\r\nI\'d rather have faced a bushmaster or a rhino.\r\n\r\nThey stood on three legs. They had globe bellies, tiny heads, and no\r\nnecks. They were of a color I had never seen before. They had two arms\r\nwith two hands attached to each arm. I suppose they were hands. They\r\nwere more like claws.\r\n\r\nI stood frozen solid. Joe Roane screamed and turned to run back up the\r\nladder. A beam flashed and Joe fell forward, silent and very dead.\r\n\r\nAfter that it was all a blank.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to I was strapped down by metal clasps on a long board made\r\nof some kind of marble. I was alone for some time.\r\n\r\nI don\'t remember how long it was before one of them appeared. 

He stood\r\nby my side, looking down at me. His eyes were purple. 

There were no\r\nwhites. "You have come a long way," he said.\r\n\r\n"You--you speak English?"\r\n\r\n"We used a 64-V machine on you. We learned your language, your\r\nthoughts, your name. We know about Norbert Marsten. A very enterprising\r\nman, it seems."\r\n\r\n"What are you going to do with me?"\r\n\r\n"We haven\'t decided yet. So you were going to take one of us back with\r\nyou for Marsten\'s circus. To exhibit one of us to your stupid race. My\r\nfollowers wanted to kill you when this information was learned. But I\r\nbelieve I have a better idea."\r\n\r\nHe went away. I yelled for him to come back. I yelled till my throat\r\nwas dry. Eventually he did come back. He came back with Joe Roane\r\nand ... myself.\r\n\r\n"I want you to meet Klar and Grat," he said. "They have taken over\r\nyour bodies; you will take theirs--and return to Marsten. We have\r\na transformer machine to accomplish this. Only we never had an\r\nopportunity to use it until you were so gracious as to visit us." He\r\nspoke on, telling me of his idea. I shuddered and wished for death. I\r\nbegged him to kill me.\r\n\r\nThen a contraption was fitted over me and it hummed and I passed out. I\r\nremember the trip back to earth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI\'m no longer Nick Faber. I\'m Marty the Martian. What a cute title\r\nMarsten had hung on me. I\'ve got a nice home and I get plenty to eat.\r\nOnly my home is a cage and it\'s made of glass. People come from all\r\nover the world just to see me. And Marsten has been to see me every\r\nday. He chews on his big cigar and there\'s a smile on his face a yard\r\nwide.\r\n\r\nI\'ve tried to talk to my keepers but all I can manage is some crazy\r\nkind of gibberish. I also see Klar and Grat. But they\'re only there\r\nwhen Marsten is around. They\'re keeping very close to him. My being\r\ntransformed into a Martian was just part of it. Klar and Grat were\r\ngoing to carry out the rest of it.\r\n\r\nOn one dark night, and very soon, Klar, Grat, and Marsten were going to\r\ndisappear.\r\n\r\nMaybe I was the greatest attraction on earth. But Norbert Marsten was\r\ngoing to be the greatest attraction on Mars.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MARTY THE MARTIAN ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
