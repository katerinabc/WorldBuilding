]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were usually a few Customs Inspectors in the lounge, waiting\r\nto begin their shifts, hanging around trading news and incidents and\r\ndrinking the bad, lukewarm kasser that was a standing joke in the\r\nImmigration-Customs Service.\r\n\r\nOld Grag was telling for perhaps the eightieth time of a success of his\r\nwhen he was young in the Service.\r\n\r\n"... They had this small box of sticky, squashy sweets with them. The\r\nyoung one was eating one. 

Many another Inspector would have passed them\r\nthrough, but I thought the young one chewed too much and too loud. So I\r\nsaid, \'Mind if I have one?\'\r\n\r\n"\'Wah!\' says they together, \'it would set you on edge, Noble Wise\r\nInspector. It is the taste of another world.\' They was Venusers, and\r\nthey started shifting and hopping around, and humming their national\r\nanthem, _you_ know how they used to do back in the old days. I made\r\nquite a nice little find. Almost a half-scree of chamfer in each one\r\nof those sweets. I got a promotion out of that, and the Venusers got a\r\nsix-year close out."\r\n\r\nInspector Flimp blew one of his noses loudly.\r\n\r\n"Hee, that\'s nothing. _I_ recall back when we first opened up for\r\nImmigration, and a whole shipload of earthers came in. They were\r\ncrammed in like tigs in a nest, and as usual they didn\'t know one word\r\nof the language, they didn\'t have any idea of where to go or how to do\r\nanything, and they\'d got separated from their controller. 

They just\r\nstood around, huddled together and jabbering at each other. 

Well, I\r\nchecked out about twenty of them, and then there comes up this big ugly\r\nfemale. Well, I jacks the elevator up some more, and I looks down at\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"\'Name!\', I call. \'Gladdis Cracklegill,\' or some other weird earth name\r\nshe screams at me. \'Too much name,\' I say. \'You\'ve got enough name\r\nthere for five of you. Which will you choose, Glad, Is, Crack, El or\r\nGil?\'\r\n\r\n"Well, it took me a while to make her understand me--my earth accent\r\nwasn\'t too good then, and she was slow-headed, having only one, like\r\nall earthers. But I finally made her understand what I wanted to know,\r\nand then, by Clag, what a ramping frowst she did make!\r\n\r\n"It was while she was screeching at me that I noticed her teeth were\r\npretty big, even for such a huge beast as she was. So I secretly turned\r\non the Dento-Spyer, right into her jaws, and what a sight on the view\r\nscreen! Each of those big teeth was false and filled to the top with\r\nEarth seeds she was trying to smuggle!"\r\n\r\n"Earthers!" exploded young Nask. 

"They make me sick!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m with you, Nask," said Inspector Sprim. "And I don\'t understand why\r\nthey _still_ keep routing earthers through Immigration anyway. They\r\nclaim they\'re a borderline case, but when you\'ve seen as many as I\r\nhave, you know, which side of the border they\'re on."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNask went off to the kasser dispenser and his place was taken by Brif,\r\nthe head Inspector, who had been listening.\r\n\r\n"Un-edge yourself, Sprim," smiled Brif, contracting one of his heads.\r\n"I have good news, rare news and fine news. The Four Council decision\r\njust came down to us. Earthers are now to be routed through Livestock\r\ninstead of Immigration beginning very soon."\r\n\r\nA cheer went up from the little group of Customs and Immigration\r\nofficials. The one Livestock Inspector in the lounge groaned in despair.\r\n\r\nOld Inspector Flimp seemed bothered.\r\n\r\n"They\'ve made themselves a mistake," he sputtered. "Earthers can be\r\nclever and tricky even after they\'re altered. Why, I seen them pull\r\nevery trick in the book coming through here. 

Did I ever tell you about\r\nthe stunted one with an artificial head who tried to pass himself off\r\nas a rest-park planner? Well, it seems that...."\r\n\r\nTwo young, but large inspectors sneaked away from the group when they\r\nsaw old Flimp was launched into one of his dull yarns again.\r\n\r\nOutside the lounge, after a quick look up and down the hall, they\r\nducked into the robot-cleaner storage closet.\r\n\r\n"Boy," gasped the shorter inspector. "I _had_ to get out of there.\r\nBesides the torture of listening to that two-headed monster babble on\r\nand on about how he outwitted earthers when he was still able to move\r\naround, this miserable thing has started to come loose again."\r\n\r\nHe gave an impatient wrench to his left head, and it wobbled enough to\r\nexpose some of the delicate wires that the earth robotic engineer had\r\nlabored over so many hours.\r\n\r\nThe other began tightening straps and buckles for him.\r\n\r\n"There," he said finally. "You look like one of the boys again."\r\n\r\nLaughing together, the earthers went back into the Customs Lounge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE CUSTOMS LOUNGE ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!)

General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
