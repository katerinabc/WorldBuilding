The trouble was he had forgotten. He didn\'t remember where it\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nHe had been speeding past an off-color white dwarf when it happened.\r\nIf he had taken the trouble to look around, he would have seen that\r\nthe white star was going to explode. He knew a potential nova when he\r\ntook a good look at one. But after all these centuries he had grown\r\ncareless, and when the blast had come--the small star suddenly blazing\r\ninto a billion-fold brilliance--the penetrating radiation had hit him\r\nwith full intensity. There had been no ship to protect him, no clothing\r\nthat might serve as a shield. His kind had done away with such things\r\neons before, as they had learned to move through space by using some\r\nof the radiant energy that filled it.\r\n\r\nHe had blacked out completely.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to again, he was far past the nova, in the dazzling\r\nbrightness of a rarefied cloud of radiant hydrogen atoms. The nova\r\nitself had lost so much of its momentary brilliance that it was now\r\nindistinguishable from the myriads of other stars. He himself was\r\nspeeding on with feverish haste toward a nebular cluster a thousand\r\nlight years away.\r\n\r\nHe slowed down. He had the feeling that the distant cluster was not his\r\nproper destination. But what was? What star, what planet was the spot\r\nin space he had to find? And what was he supposed to do once he got\r\nthere?\r\n\r\nAnd who had given him the instructions? Where, in the vast immensity\r\nof the universe was the place called "home", the place where he could\r\nreturn for the information he had forgotten?\r\n\r\nHe didn\'t recall. He knew only, with that same distressing vagueness,\r\nthat somewhere there was something he had been ordered to do. And that\r\nonce given, the order had to be carried out.\r\n\r\nHe traveled aimlessly, by feeling alone. Time meant nothing to him as\r\nan individual, for his kind had long mastered the problems of age. But\r\ntime meant much to those he had been sent to--to do what? Was it to\r\nhelp? They must be waiting for him now. They must be wondering why he\r\ndidn\'t come.\r\n\r\nHe would have to hurry. Hurry to do something he didn\'t yet suspect,\r\nbut would sooner or later remember.\r\n\r\nAfter a few centuries, he began, in his anxiety, to talk to himself,\r\nas is the way of individuals too long alone. "That star cluster there\r\ncould be it," he said to himself hopefully, and veered toward the right.\r\n\r\n"Doesn\'t look familiar, though," he muttered. "Maybe if I would get\r\ncloser--"\r\n\r\nHe came close enough to see the thousands of stars as individuals, to\r\npick out the satellites circling the bright discs of light, to study\r\nthe pale planets themselves and their tiny subsatellites. As he turned\r\nhis attention from one to another, disappointment slowly filled him.\r\nNo, this was not the place. There was nothing in the configuration of\r\nthe stars, nothing in the size or position of the planets that sounded\r\na familiar chord in his consciousness. He would have to go further--or\r\nturn back.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe left the place behind him. The next time the same thing happened he\r\ndidn\'t have quite so much hope, and his disappointment was less keen.\r\nBut it was disappointment none the less. Time was passing, and they\r\nmust be waiting for him impatiently.\r\n\r\nAfter a while the hope and the disappointment both died away almost\r\ncompletely. The former shrank to a tiny spark that grew dimmer and\r\ndimmer as the centuries passed. He wondered if it would ever wink out\r\nentirely.\r\n\r\nIt was characteristic of him that the anxiety this caused was only\r\nfor those who were waiting, expecting him hourly, and wondering why\r\nhe didn\'t come. He had no sense of fear for himself, no feeling of\r\ndespairing loneliness that might be expected to arise from being so\r\nlong isolated in space. It was only that he would have liked some one\r\nto talk to, besides himself.\r\n\r\nOn a fair number of planets he found animal-like creatures in\r\ndifferent stages of development, and on a few he discovered life that\r\nwas intelligent. It was with these that he had a renewed feeling of\r\nanticipation, the spark of hope glowing momentarily before it faded\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"It\'s intelligent life I\'ve got to find," he told himself. "But where?"\r\n\r\nHis astronomical memory, insofar as it covered the post-nova\r\nperiod, was perfect, and he paid more attention to the details of\r\nstar-and-planet configuration than he had ever done before. Gradually\r\na star-map formed in his mind, a map that covered enormous distances\r\nof space. Those places he had investigated and eliminated from\r\nconsideration were slowly crossed off. It was a large needle he had to\r\nfind, and his own powers were considerable, but the haystack he had to\r\nsearch was infinite. There was no telling how many more centuries would\r\npass before he found it.\r\n\r\nAnd then another thought struck him. They\'d know back home that\r\nsomething had gone wrong. Would they send someone else to do the job in\r\nhis place?\r\n\r\nHe rather doubted it. He had a vague feeling that there weren\'t many\r\nwith his own peculiar talents. 

What had to be done had to be done by\r\nhim, or left undone altogether.\r\n\r\nMore time passed. And one day, when the space charted on his brain-map\r\nhad grown to vast dimensions, and the spark of hope had become so tiny\r\nthat he was not quite sure any longer that it was there at all, he\r\nnoted from a distance a galaxy that seemed familiar.\r\n\r\n"That\'s it!" he cried. "That\'s it!"\r\n\r\nThe spark flared, and as he sped toward the galaxy it became a flame.\r\nIt was a lens-shaped assemblage of stars, with two small spiral arms\r\ncomposed of a few million stars each, and it was seemingly not too\r\ndifferent from millions of other galaxies he had passed in the course\r\nof all those centuries. But to him, seeking so desperately, this galaxy\r\nwas unique. It was the right one. He coursed through it from spiral arm\r\nto spiral arm, and now there could be no doubt. The star he wanted was\r\nsmall and yellowish, far from the center of the lens. It had a rather\r\nelaborate planetary system, which he recognized at once.\r\n\r\nThis was it. The third planet, the one with a single subsatellite, was\r\nthe one he had been sent to find. To find, and perhaps to help. But how?\r\n\r\nThe finding of the planet had solved one problem. So far it had given\r\nhim not a hint toward the solution of the second--the reason why he had\r\nbeen sent here.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was life on this ball of mud and water, a great deal of life,\r\nboth vegetable and animal. And some of the latter could, without too\r\ngreat a distortion of the truth, be called intelligent. 

It had raised\r\ncities, tunneled into mountains, changed the appearance of sections of\r\nthe planet itself. It was to this intelligent life that he had been\r\nsent.\r\n\r\nA dim memory of the need for caution kept him from letting himself be\r\nseen. "I\'d only frighten them," he thought. "I\'ll have to investigate\r\nthoroughly before I reveal myself. And maybe the investigation will\r\nremind me of what I have to do.

"\r\n\r\nThe first thing was to come down to earth. Choosing the dark side of\r\nthe planet, shaded from the central sun by its own bulk, he shrank his\r\nbody and let himself drop in the gravitational field. From time to time\r\nhe slowed his fall in order to keep from flaming through the atmosphere\r\nand attracting their attention. And at a thousand feet above the\r\nsurface he came to a complete stop, hovering over a city, and making up\r\nhis mind where to land.\r\n\r\nSomething droned toward him through the air, colored lights winking\r\non and off. He darted downward and to one side. Where the city lights\r\nfaded out, he let himself fall all the way to the ground.\r\n\r\nHe was off a dimly lit highway. Small metal vehicles ran along it,\r\ntheir lights momentarily tearing apart the darkness ahead of them. A\r\nglance through the metal at the creatures inside the vehicles gave him\r\na queer thrill. Yes, these were the ones he had been sent to.\r\n\r\nQuickly reshaping his body and clothing himself so that he seemed to\r\nbe one of them, he began to walk along the highway. Cars sped past him,\r\npicking him out in their headlights. None of them stopped, but he had\r\ntime to probe their minds and listen to their language.\r\n\r\nWhat he found was not pleasant. Among all the feelings which controlled\r\ntheir thoughts, fear was easiest to detect. And along with the fear\r\nwere hatred and envy and greed, anxiety and guilt. Oddly enough, there\r\nwere also hope and affection for each other, but it was the worse\r\nfeelings that predominated. There was no doubt that they needed help.\r\n\r\nThat didn\'t make any clearer, however, what he had to do. He had an\r\nidea that it was not his mission to work out a detailed solution. 

He\r\nhad to do some simple thing, something--\r\n\r\nThe two men were lying in wait, either for him or for some other\r\npedestrian they judged sufficiently unwary. He sensed them long before\r\nthe first one stepped out toward him, a cigarette in one hand and what\r\nwas supposed to be an ingratiating look on the brutal face.\r\n\r\n"Got a match, bud?"\r\n\r\nThe other man suddenly plunged at him from the side, an arm wrapping\r\nitself around his neck. The assailant tried to bend him back, the\r\nforearm cutting across his windpipe. The arm of the first man swung, a\r\nrough fist smashing at his face.\r\n\r\nThen the two assailants screamed in pain and terror. Where they had\r\ntouched him, fist and arm broke into flame. Both men turned from him in\r\nhorror, and ran off wildly, as if to get away from themselves.\r\n\r\nHe hadn\'t meant to hurt them, but they had contrived their own\r\npunishment. Perhaps--no, that wasn\'t it. 

He wasn\'t here to punish\r\neither.\r\n\r\nHe walked along, and soon he found himself entering the city. A man in\r\na blue uniform watched him suspiciously and ordered him gruffly to get\r\nmoving.\r\n\r\n"I am moving," he said pleasantly.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you get wise with me," said the bluecoat, and raised a\r\nthreatening club.\r\n\r\nHe paid no attention to the club and kept on, toward the heart of the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nWhat he saw only confirmed the impression he had obtained from the\r\nminds of the men and women in the cars. Too many thoughts were mean and\r\nignoble, arising only from selfish and vicious desires. 

Many of those\r\nwho saw him seemed to sense his strangeness, and moved toward him with\r\na single impulse--to take advantage of his ignorance. Men spoke to him\r\nout of the sides of their mouths, offering him bargains. Women offered\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n"_Look, Mac, this stuff is hot, see? Just came off a truck_--"\r\n\r\n"_Wanta look at some nice pictures, Mister?_"\r\n\r\n"_I can give you a good address, Bud._"\r\n\r\n"_Out for a good time, Jack?_"\r\n\r\nThe planet was sick. Had he been sent to cure it?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe came to an area of broad lighted streets. Lights glittered\r\neverywhere, attracting the attention of those around him by going on\r\nand off. Great posters advertised the attractions inside places of\r\namusement.\r\n\r\nHe entered one of them, an astonished ticket-collector calling after\r\nhim, "Hey, where\'s your ticket, Bud?" But there was something about him\r\nthat prevented the man from pursuing.\r\n\r\nHe lost himself in the darkness and watched the screen. 

Here, in\r\nbrief and vivid form, was pictured the life of the planet. Women in\r\nbathing suits plunged into a pool and formed a pattern which imitated\r\nsensuously the petals of an unfolding rose. A small animal leaped\r\nthrough hoops and climbed a ladder. Groups of men drove against each\r\nother for possession of an object which they kicked occasionally\r\ninto the air. An elderly man looked grim and made a speech into a\r\nmicrophone. And then a film showed the main business of the planet,\r\nwhich seemed to be the killing of its supposedly intelligent\r\ninhabitants. Bombs exploded, planes crashed, desperate lines of men ran\r\nforward to meet their deaths.\r\n\r\nSomething quickened in his mind. He almost remembered now. This was\r\nwhat he had come here about.\r\n\r\nHis will moved, and the theatre vanished behind him. Now he was on the\r\nbattlefield itself.\r\n\r\nThe reality was worse than the image, far worse. Here were not only the\r\nroars of the great guns, but the curses and screams of the wounded, the\r\ngasps of the dying. Here were not only horrible sights and sounds, but\r\nthe odors of death--the sharp nitrogenous fragrance of explosives, the\r\nheavy sulfurous smoke of burning oil, the sickening smell of sweating\r\nor decaying flesh.\r\n\r\nA cloud came into being from the explosion of a mortar shell, and two\r\nmen dropped to the ground. In answer to the mortar, the flaring barrel\r\nof a tank gun spoke hoarsely, and half the crew of the mortar fell in\r\nturn. 

But there seemed no end to this deadly dialogue. The next moment\r\nthere came the burst of a bomb from a low-flying plane, and the tank\r\nhalf turned over on its side, a heap of smoking steel.\r\n\r\nHe knew at last why he had been sent here. He knew now what he had to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nHe ripped the flaring-mouthed gun from the tank. His hands twisted the\r\nthick metal into a shape it had never known before, bent it into a\r\nstrange curve, fashioned it so that it would emit overtones to chill\r\nthe souls of those who heard it. His brain charged the instrument with\r\nthe energy of his own mind, energy that would send its voice to the far\r\ncorners of this diseased planet, and leave not a single individual deaf\r\nto its dreaded tones.\r\n\r\nPutting the improvised horn to his lips, Gabriel blew the call for\r\nwhich the planet had so long been waiting.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MESSENGER ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!)

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\xe2\x80\x99s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
