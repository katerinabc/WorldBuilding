And,\r\n        centuries later, it was dutifully recovered. 

Only...._\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Worlds of If Science Fiction, January 1955.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Travelers from Outer Space dug into the pile of moldering\r\nrock, they found the metal capsule their senses had told them was\r\nthere. Battered and corroded though it was, the shadow vibrations\r\nshowed that it had once been smooth and shiny. As smooth, shiny and\r\nimpervious to wear as Twentieth Century Earth technology could make it.\r\n\r\nAt the time the Mayor of Chicago had ceremoniously tossed a handful\r\nof lake sand into the hole, had his picture taken smiling against\r\nthe skyline, and had moved away to let the workmen fill the hole with\r\ncement and place the marker, the Time Capsule had been bright with the\r\nhopes of civilization sending its proud present into the uncertain\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nTime passed....\r\n\r\nThe tiny radio transmitter in the capsule began throwing out its wide\r\nsignal at the exact instant planned for it many centuries before. No\r\none heard. 

Eventually, the tiny powerful batteries gave out. The signal\r\ndied.\r\n\r\nTime passed....\r\n\r\nWhen the Travelers from Outer Space took the capsule back to their ship\r\nand opened it, they found the contents in perfect order. Even the reel\r\nof magnetic tape had not succumbed to the centuries.\r\n\r\nIn due course, the Travelers examined the tape, divined its purpose,\r\nand constructed a machine that would play back the recording.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOut of a million evolutionary possibilities in a Universe of planets,\r\nthe chances of two intelligent races being even roughly similar are\r\nastronomically remote.\r\n\r\nA being develops sense organs for no other reason than to make it aware\r\nof its environment. The simplest primitive being\'s awareness of its\r\nenvironment centers around food, its means of survival. It develops\r\norgans and appendages that will enable it to ferret out, obtain and\r\ningest its food. As the food differs, so, then, does the eater.\r\n\r\nThe Travelers had no ears or eyes, as such. They had other organs for\r\nother purposes, but the net result was that they "saw" and "heard"\r\nquite as well--even better--than Earthmen.\r\n\r\nPerhaps that explains why the Travelers gleaned so much more from the\r\ntape recording in the Twentieth Century capsule than its originators\r\nhad planned or intended.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNot just any radio show could be placed in the Time Capsule. What\r\npicture of contemporary 1960 mankind would the men of the future derive\r\nfrom a soap opera? A news analysis? 

Or top comedy show? Certainly not\r\na flattering one, and so, reasoned the brass in charge of the project,\r\nnot a true one.\r\n\r\nNo, the only answer was to produce a special documentary program,\r\npainting on a broad canvas the glories that were the common man\'s\r\nbirthright in an enlightened democracy. As July 4th was only a\r\nmonth away, the idea was a natural. The program would be carried\r\nsimultaneously on four networks, then placed in the Time Capsule so\r\nthat historians of the future would have something solid on which to\r\nbase their conclusions.\r\n\r\nA famous poet-radio writer was hired to write the script. Hollywood\'s\r\ngreatest young male star donated his services (with much attendant\r\npublicity) as narrator. A self-acknowledged genius who directed radio\r\nshows for a living condescended to lend his talents to the production.\r\nNumerous other actors, musicians, technicians and assistants were\r\nhired ... none well-known, but all quite competent.\r\n\r\nJuly 4th, the big day, arrived. The cast went into rehearsal early in\r\nthe morning. 

By the second complete run-through, just before the break\r\nfor lunch, the show was hanging together nicely. After four hours of\r\npolishing in the afternoon, it was ready to go on the air. Everyone\'s\r\nnerves were raw, but the show sounded great.\r\n\r\nNaturally, when a room full of creative people have been rubbing\r\nagainst one another for a full day, a lot of emotions are generated.\r\nThe listening audience never knew about it, but it took the actors,\r\ndirectors, musicians and technicians several days to get the session\r\nout of their systems. During rehearsals, the young Hollywood star\r\ndeveloped a consuming lust for one of the minor actresses. One of the\r\nminor actors developed a consuming lust for the young Hollywood star.\r\nEveryone immediately hated the director, and he, lofty and all-wise,\r\ncontemptuously hated them in return. By eight o\'clock that night, show\r\ntime, the splendid documentary on the splendid American people was not\r\nthe only thing that was at peak pitch.\r\n\r\nIt was the only thing, however, that the radio audience heard. It was\r\nmagnificent. Future students hearing the tape could not but conclude\r\nthat here was the Golden Age. Man, at least American man, circa 1960,\r\nnoble, humble and sincere, was carrying in his bosom the seeds of\r\ngreatness. Difficulties still existed, of course, but they were not\r\ninsurmountable. 

A few deluded people seemed to be working against the\r\ncommon good, but the program left no doubt that this would be cleaned\r\nup in short order. The millenium was at hand!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the Travelers from Outer Space, who were a team of historians\r\ndoing research on the history of life throughout the Universe, listened\r\nto the tape recording, their "ears" heard none of the program as it had\r\nbeen originally broadcast. They were no less fascinated, however, for\r\nwhat they heard was the thought patterns of the people who had been\r\nconnected with the program. These thoughts, in the form of electrical\r\nimpulses, were also recorded on the magnetic surface of the tape, and\r\nwere the only sounds audible to the Travelers.\r\n\r\nWhat a pity these future historians didn\'t get mankind\'s version of\r\nthe life of mankind in 1960, after the producers had gone to so much\r\ntrouble to tie it up in a package for them. Their conception of Earth\r\nculture was based on the thought impulses they "heard", and their\r\nHistory of Earth was written accordingly. The last paragraph is worth\r\nnoting:\r\n\r\n"In the main, it is quite fortunate for life in the Universe that these\r\nprimitive people destroyed themselves before they learned how to leave\r\ntheir planet. Lustful, murderous and guilt-ridden, they are perhaps the\r\nworst examples of intelligent life that we have ever discovered. 

And\r\nyet, paradox supreme, they had one quality that we ourselves would do\r\nwell to emulate. That quality we can only surmise, for nothing on the\r\nrecording spoke of it, yet it is obvious, for if they hadn\'t had this\r\nquality, there would have been no recording left for us at all.\r\n\r\n"_How strange that these tortured people should practise an\r\nunparalleled example of Life\'s highest achievement ... complete honesty\r\nwith themselves and others._"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK DOUBLE TAKE ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!)

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
