Had there even been\r\n                  so sweet a sound? 

Arak Miller ached\r\n                  for it--too eagerly; too swiftly._\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n                      Planet Stories Winter 1954.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTwenty-five years later a ship appeared, on an afternoon in the\r\nplanet\'s summer.\r\n\r\nArak Miller watched it from the mesa.\r\n\r\n_From Earth_, he thought. _From Earth!_\r\n\r\nBut Arak Miller was an ordered man. Even now, in the face of resurging\r\nvisions of his wife, and his sons, and his work, and the mighty\r\ncivilization from which he had been cut adrift, his thoughts were\r\nordered: probably the ship had arrived from Earth to resurvey one of\r\nthe Class II uninhabitable planets of the Alpha Centaurus System.\r\nTomorrow its scout ships would whip along the day sides at five\r\nthousand feet. Tomorrow atop the mesa he must light his pyres, some\r\nhundred-odd gigantic piles of pine trees and brush that would burn with\r\nbillowing smoke. He must signal the presence of a lone Earthman.\r\n\r\nWith a hypnotic intensity he stood watching the ship until, toward\r\nevening, it merged into the gray sky over the horizon. Then he ran\r\nacross the clearing and down to his house by the river that wound\r\nthrough the valley a thousand feet below. 

"Come on, you fool!" he\r\nshouted to Marbach, sitting beneath a tree. Arak Miller threw the\r\nfigure over his shoulder and carried him to the house. He sat Marbach\r\non a chair and went into the kitchen to eat.\r\n\r\nArak Miller had been nomadic the first few years after he crashed and\r\nhad been abandoned for dead, until he found in the planet\'s narrow\r\ntemperate zone one of the few arable regions capable of sustaining him.\r\nThere was sufficient small game, the river was cool, and because the\r\nrain fell mainly in the valley, his pyres were safe.\r\n\r\nIn recent years he was always building. He had added a front porch to\r\nthe cabin he had started with, then more rooms which he had never\r\nused, then an attic into which he never went. Now it was a house. It\r\nhad chairs and tables, a bed, a rug of vines, a garden for vegetables\r\nand tobacco, and a garden for flowers.\r\n\r\nHe ate a leisurely meal of potatoes and corn and meat of the\r\nrabbit-like creatures which he trapped. Miss Gormeley was sitting on\r\nthe porch as he went out. "A ship\'s come," he shouted. "I may be saved,\r\nyou understand?"\r\n\r\nHe recalled he had intended to do something about Miss Gormeley\'s\r\nnostril. With one of his knives he scraped a little against the wall of\r\nher left nostril. Then he stood back, satisfied. "Now you look better,"\r\nhe said. With a wry grin he added, "You can smell better, too."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor a long time he could not sleep, remembering that he had been cut\r\noff in the prime of his life. He had been the Senior Astrophysicist\r\nin the Systems War Office on Earth, working on the Second Einstein\r\nModifications that promised travel to the more distant galactic\r\nSystems. He had completed six months of comparison spectography in the\r\nbarren Centaurus System and had been about to take the year\'s return\r\njourney to Earth, looking forward to a vacation trip with his family to\r\nVenus City. He had been in the forefront of the free world\'s pushing\r\nback of the last frontiers of man.\r\n\r\nHe twisted on his bed in a wild agony of hope and yearning. "Someday\r\nsoon," he shouted to the walls, "I\'ll ride the monorail across the\r\nWestern plains." He had discovered that it helped, to talk aloud,\r\nthough none of his devices could make him forget he was a prisoner. To\r\nfeel the Centaurus skies closing down on him and the alien mountains\r\ncrushing him, so far from his work and those he loved, was to feel a\r\nterrible suffocation from which there was no release.\r\n\r\nBut then he would go doggedly to work, or else carve the life-size\r\nfigures to keep him silent company, and try to forget.\r\n\r\nHe talked on and on, and finally he could talk no more. He slept.\r\n\r\nHe was awakened by a pattering on the roof.\r\n\r\n"Rain!" he shouted. He jumped up and ran to the window socket. The rain\r\nclouds were high, and heavy with storm.\r\n\r\nIt struck him like a blow: they hung above the mesa.\r\n\r\nAbove his pyres.\r\n\r\nIn a panic he clambered up to the mesa, forgetting his breakfast,\r\nforgetting his outer clothing, his mind in disorder.\r\n\r\nThe shock wave pounded his eardrums.\r\n\r\nHe was too startled to make words. With unbelieving eyes he saw, about\r\nfive miles away where the river emptied into the sea, the black cloud\r\nof an atomic explosion rise into the sky to spread out under the rain.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly he was running blindly through the rain. The scout must\r\nhave come down. 

They must be testing. The area was ideal for testing\r\natomic weapons. _I must reach them before they leave._\r\n\r\nThrough heavy undergrowth he pushed his way down the slope to the\r\nvalley. His foot slipped on an exposed root. With a sharp crack of\r\nbone, he fell.\r\n\r\n"My ankle!" he screamed, with terror smashing at his mind. He managed\r\nto find two thick lengths of branch that would serve as crutches. Then\r\nhe started hobbling awkwardly toward the river.\r\n\r\nFor an hour he forced himself on urgently along the river bank, now\r\nfeeling knife-like pains slicing up through his body. The effort of\r\nmoving was beginning to exhaust him.\r\n\r\nHe fell down, and rested a moment. He heard a tree crash in the forest\r\nahead. He heard someone shout.\r\n\r\nA human voice!\r\n\r\nHe began to sob, softly at first, then uncontrollably. A human voice!\r\nIt had never been so sweet a sound.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe climbed painfully to his feet, crashed on through the undergrowth.\r\nThe density of trees ended abruptly and he stopped. Around the scout\r\nship in the clearing beyond, robot dredges were digging the foundations\r\nfor buildings. Gray-uniformed men were setting up new-type atomic\r\nartillery at the perimeters.\r\n\r\nArak Miller drew a deep breath. "I\'m saved," he said, his voice\r\nbreaking. "I\'m going to be a free man!" He tottered on the edge of\r\nhysteria, but controlled himself with a mighty effort of will.\r\n\r\nHe took a step forward to reach the clearing. Then he stopped.\r\n\r\nSomething was wrong.\r\n\r\nHe tried to put together the pieces of his mind. Everything looked\r\nnormal. Construction going on, stores being transferred to temporary\r\nwarehouses, all the usual activities of a scout party on an atomic\r\ntesting mission. The artillery was pointing--\r\n\r\nThat was the flaw.\r\n\r\nThe artillery faced inward.\r\n\r\nHe looked back at the construction work. "Not foundations for\r\nbuildings," he said dully. "Ditches.

"\r\n\r\nAs he watched, a flag was run up on a pole. The dreams of Arak Miller\r\ncrashed in his mind.\r\n\r\nIt was the flag of the slave world, super-imposed upon the symbol of\r\nthe Systems. The world controlled by the dictators, which for centuries\r\nhad existed alongside the free world in a perpetual cold war. During\r\nsome stage of Arak Miller\'s long imprisonment, from Venus to Centaurus\r\nthe dictators had taken over.\r\n\r\nHidden from guards, he lay on the ground and watched for a long time.\r\nOnly when the next batch of captives was taken out of the scout ship\r\nand lined up in front of the ditch, did he turn his gaze away.\r\n\r\nHe waited till the next shock wave had passed, then with tears\r\nstreaming down his face, hobbled back in the rain toward the river.\r\nHe crawled the last two miles to his house. Miss Gormeley was sitting\r\nwhere he had left her. 

"I am sorry," he said painfully. 

"I will have to\r\ndestroy you. And Marbach. And our house, and the pyres. And when all\r\nthat is done, I will have to leave this area. 

Otherwise they might find\r\nme."\r\n\r\nMiss Gormeley stared blindly out at the river.\r\n\r\nHe lay still on the floor, gasping for breath. "You see," he explained,\r\n"I am not a prisoner. They are the prisoners. All of them. 

All the\r\nworld--but me."\r\n\r\nHis eyes closed in exhaustion. "I like it here now," he said, almost in\r\na whisper. "I intend to stay. 

There must be some place here where they\r\ncan never find me, you understand?"\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE RECLUSE ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
