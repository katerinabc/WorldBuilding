]\r\n\r\n\r\nWith his explanations to the reporters completed, Dr. King felt that\r\nwhen he pulled the switch he would automatically restore his good name\r\nand bring to a close a career of solid scientific achievement. Most of\r\nall, he would bring to an end the practice of referring to him as "Side\r\nEffect Charlie."\r\n\r\nDr. Charles King was willing to admit that there were excellent reasons\r\nfor his acquiring this hated nickname. The facts were that the bulk of\r\nhis scientific achievements were made inadvertently--that is to say,\r\nhis discoveries were all made through investigation of unexpected\r\nside effects of his experiments. In a career conspicuous for unusual,\r\nunanticipated side effects, two in particular stand out.\r\n\r\nThe first discovery resulted in rendering the entire heat-oriented\r\nmetallurgical industry obsolete, and founding upon its corpse a new\r\nindustry. This was based on the extracting of metal from ore and\r\nits subsequent shaping by first eliminating the bonds that hold the\r\nmolecules of metal together, and then reversing the process when the\r\ndesired shape was attained. Dr. King did not discover this process\r\ndirectly. He thought he had discovered a method of making metal\r\nsurfaces self-lubricating and 100% friction free. It was not until\r\nseveral installations utilizing his lubrication method became pools\r\nof liquid metal that Dr. King bothered to discover how his method\r\nworked, and of course the means to reverse his process. The resulting\r\nrevolution in metal-processing methods endeared him to everyone--except\r\na few vested interests like the shareholders in existing metal\r\ncompanies, who were uniformly glum.\r\n\r\nThe second discovery, although monumental in itself, is important\r\nbecause it indirectly led to the special project which Dr. King was\r\njust completing. 

Dr. King succeeded in growing some crystals in a\r\nnutrient solution. What actually happened was that while eating lunch\r\nat a lab table he managed to knock something into something else and a\r\ncrystal developed. Dr. King became fascinated with the odd structure\r\nof these crystals as revealed to him under an electron microscope. (He\r\nhad incidentally placed the crystal under the microscope in error.)\r\nAs a result, he took to investigating the properties of the crystals\r\nwhenever he could find time. Despite his well earned reputation as an\r\naccidental discoverer, it should be pointed out that Dr. King is a\r\nvery methodical man. This means he is capable of repeating the same\r\nmistake twice, or for that matter any number of times. Therefore, Dr.\r\nKing produced all the crystals he needed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was during a vacation in the Adirondacks that Dr. King discovered\r\nthe propulsive qualities of the crystals.\r\n\r\nThis discovery, of course, is what led to the perfection of the "King\r\nPropulsor Unit," the heart of our starship drive systems. Dr. King\r\nwas investigating the piezo-electric properties of the crystals in a\r\nmakeshift device of his own design when he was disturbed by a sudden\r\ndraft in the room. He looked up to discover that one wall of his\r\nworkshop and the top one thousand feet of a mile-thick mountain (the\r\nsame mountain that his cabin was located upon) were no longer in the\r\nimmediate vicinity.\r\n\r\nAs it turned out, his crude device did not impart to the mountain\r\nall of the thrust inherent in the crystal. The mountain top reached\r\nonly to the orbit of Jupiter, where it settled down to become its\r\nnewest satellite. Coincidental with Dr. King\'s experiment, intensive\r\nastronomical work was going on with Jupiter as its prime object. The\r\ncapturing of the satellite was observed and recorded independently by\r\nat least six observatories, including the one on Tycho.\r\n\r\nSubsequent investigation of the time involved to project this mass\r\ndisclosed that Dr. King had invented a faster than light drive. (It\r\nshould be pointed out that, while the discovery of the faster than\r\nlight drive made the name of Dr. King world renowned, it did not in any\r\nway endear him to the relatives of those thousand-odd persons who lived\r\nin the hamlet located on the mountain top that ended up a satellite of\r\nJupiter. They also were quite glum.

)\r\n\r\nFurther work, all of a mathematical nature, disclosed to Dr. King the\r\nproper method of enclosing these crystals in a unit to drive space\r\nships to the stars. Coincidental with his work on the propulsor units\r\nhe made a startling discovery which led to his special project.\r\n\r\nDr. King invented perpetual motion.\r\n\r\nA series of complicated equations indicated to Dr. King that if he\r\nenclosed six of the crystals in the business end of a pendulum, and\r\nstarted the pendulum oscillating, it would tick-tock for all eternity.\r\n\r\nThis discovery began a five-year program that ended with a full scale\r\npress conference. The purpose was to unveil the building designed to\r\nprotect this pendulum for all eternity, and of course to unveil the\r\ndiscovery of perpetual motion at the same time.\r\n\r\nThis building was designed to be Dr. King\'s monument to his own genius.\r\nIt was a large rambling structure in which the pendulum was displayed\r\nby viewing it through a large hole in a brick wall. All of Dr. King\'s\r\nconsiderable savings had gone into designing a computer, the heart\r\nof his protective system. The computer was programmed to protect the\r\nticking of the pendulum under every conceivable circumstance. So\r\nthorough was this programming that special devices were installed to\r\nkeep the building and its precious cargo moving in earth\'s projected\r\norbit if, through some gigantic mishap, the earth was reduced to cosmic\r\ndust. The switch that would impart the initial pulse to the pendulum\r\nwould also start the computer operating, rendering the entire structure\r\ntotally inviolable.\r\n\r\nWith a flourish, Dr. King pulled the switch.\r\n\r\nNothing happened.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was an embarrassed shuffling of feet by the reporters. Then, as\r\nDr. King became more exasperated, the reporters became amused. 

The\r\namusement turned to open laughter when Dr. King, frantic with fear,\r\nrushed to the door to check the wiring on the inside of the building.\r\n\r\nThe door would not open. The computer was at work guarding a\r\nnonfunctioning machine.\r\n\r\nHe rushed to the open hole in the wall, intending to provide the\r\ninitial pulse necessary to start the pendulum swinging by pushing.\r\nHe found that the computer had designed a force field to keep him\r\nfrom entering. Frustrated and at his wit\'s end, he flew into a rage\r\nwhich ended in a fatal heart attack when he heard one reporter\r\nlaughingly say to him: "Don\'t let it get you down, Doctor. 

You\'ve\r\nbeat the jinx. In one step you\'ve gone from \'Side-Effect-Charlie\' to\r\n\'No-Effect-Charlie.\'"\r\n\r\nIt would be comforting to be able to assure everyone that the reporter\r\nin question was correct. Unfortunately Dr. King\'s monument did work,\r\nand probably will work for all eternity. 

The day after Dr. Charles\r\nKing had his unfortunate heart attack a homesick astronomer on Sirius\r\nreported to his superior, and subsequently to the entire populated\r\nuniverse, that when he turned his telescope on the Solar System he\r\ndiscovered that it had acquired a new motion.\r\n\r\nThe entire system swung back and forth like a pendulum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MONUMENT ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!)

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
