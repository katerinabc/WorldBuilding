His death was\r\n            certain--for the enemy numbered trillions, a--\r\n\r\n                           Homecoming Horde\r\n\r\n                         By Robert Silverberg\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Imagination Stories of Science and Fantasy\r\n                              August 1958\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.

]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe room was sealed as tightly as possible. Haverford had checked it\r\nfor cracks, made sure the windows were caulked, and now kept constant\r\nguard. He was alone. He could never tell when the alien invaders would\r\nbreak through.\r\n\r\n_I must be nearly the last_, he thought. It was strange, this feeling\r\nof being alone on Earth. But it was probably true.\r\n\r\nThe aliens had come six days before. Haverford remembered picking up\r\ntheir ultimatum on his ham set:--\r\n\r\n              EARTHMEN, THE LANTHAII ARE COMING. BEWARE!\r\n\r\nThat was all it had been--an ominous warning, rather than a threat or\r\nan order. The way the message had been worded left little doubt that\r\nthey were conquerors--conquerors from space.\r\n\r\nHaverford had been amused, at first. A solitary recluse, he had little\r\ndealings with his fellow men, at least not in person. The costly ham\r\nset that occupied nearly a third of his one-room flat was his sole\r\ncontact. Through radio he kept in regular touch with "friends" in\r\nYokohama and Buenos Aires, Texas and Oregon, while actually leaving the\r\nconfines of his own room at increasingly rare intervals.\r\n\r\nHe had, naturally, picked up the Lanthaii messages on his set. There\r\nwasn\'t an amateur operator in the world that hadn\'t detected them. That\r\nwas when he began to feel it wasn\'t a joke.\r\n\r\nReports came in. Dazo Osaki, the Japanese contact, reported hearing the\r\nstrange message; Lionel Bentham in Sussex picked it up also, as did\r\nMiguel Bartirone in Buenos Aires. EARTHMEN, THE LANTHAII ARE COMING.\r\nBEWARE! Someone--there was no doubt of it--was beaming the message at\r\nthe entire Earth from _outside_.\r\n\r\nAnd then the Lanthaii had come.\r\n\r\nHaverford, pacing his room nervously, remembered the day of\r\ntheir landing. He had been talking to Bentham, the Englishman, a\r\nslow-speaking, phlegmatic sort.\r\n\r\n"--so I mean to write to my man in Parliament, y\'know, and ask him to\r\nplump for the legislation. It\'ll be a great boon for ham operators\r\nif--Lord! What\'s that! _What\'s that?_"\r\n\r\nHaverford had stared at the transmitter in shocked surprise as\r\nBentham\'s voice was replaced with the screeching of static, then\r\nsome other sounds he did not understand, followed by a quick, sharp,\r\nrepulsive clicking, and--\r\n\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\n"Bentham! Bentham!"\r\n\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat had been the beginning. The Lanthaii had landed, all right. The\r\nalien invaders were sweeping the world.\r\n\r\nHaverford got the details from a news broadcast. They had come in\r\nsilvery ships, hundreds of them. Thousands.\r\n\r\n"You should have seen it," Bartirone told him, speaking in his accented\r\nEnglish. "All over Buenos Aires, in midday--suddenly, the sky was\r\nblotted out. Ships. 

Silvery ships. They seemed small. 

They started to\r\nland."\r\n\r\n"Have you seen the invaders yourself?"\r\n\r\n"No. Not yet. They haven\'t come this far west in the city yet. But--"\r\n\r\nThe Argentinan\'s voice stopped. Haverford listened numbly, knowing\r\ndespite himself exactly what had happened. The invaders had come.\r\n\r\nHe rose, looked around his room. He had enough food in the freezer\r\nand on the shelves to last for months. Haverford was a frugal man; by\r\nbuying in quantity, he saved precious cash that was used for augmenting\r\nthe radio set.\r\n\r\nHe decided to hide in his home--to seal it from the outside world, to\r\nwait. Perhaps the invaders would be driven back; perhaps Earth would\r\nfall. But he would be safe. He would not be killed in the war of\r\nconquest.\r\n\r\nHe made sure there was no way his room could be entered. Just as he was\r\nabout to nail fast the bolt that held the door shut, he heard knocking.\r\n\r\nThree sharp knocks. Haverford leaped for the bolt, drove it home, hung\r\ntensely against the door.\r\n\r\n"Who is it?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Kelley," came the reply.\r\n\r\nHe almost fainted from relief. He had expected the aliens--and it was\r\nonly the landlady. Cautiously, he threw open the door.\r\n\r\n"Yes?"\r\n\r\n"Have you heard, Mr. Haverford? About the invasion, I mean?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'ve heard. 

What of it?"\r\n\r\n"I just thought I\'d tell you," she said, shrugging. "I know you don\'t\r\ngo out much or read the papers, and I thought maybe--"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve heard over the radio," he told her stiffly. "Is there anything\r\nelse I can do for you?"\r\n\r\n"No--not at all."\r\n\r\n"Very well, then. If anyone comes to see me, you can tell them I\'m not\r\nlooking for visitors."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mr. Haverford."\r\n\r\nShe disappeared into the darkness of the corridor. Haverford slammed\r\nthe door, shot the bolt home, nailed it fast. So far as the outside\r\nworld was concerned, he was as good as dead.\r\n\r\nHe set to work sealing himself in.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwo days passed--two days in which gradually, one by one, his contacts\r\nhere and there over the globe were silenced. Bentham had gone first,\r\nthen Bartirone. His two Japanese friends were gone now too; the Orient\r\nwas overrun by the invaders. South America as well.\r\n\r\nWord was coming from the States of alien advances. New York was\r\nin Lanthaii hands, and no broadcasts were being made from there.\r\nThe United Nations delegates had fled to an unnamed city and were\r\ncontinuing to talk--to discuss the situation, no doubt, Haverford\r\nthought bitterly.\r\n\r\nBut talk would do no good. Soon the entire world would be in alien\r\nhands, and there would be no stopping them. 

None at all.\r\n\r\nTexas went. Oregon. The aliens were obviously working their way toward\r\nthe center of North America: so far Chicago had reported no alien\r\nattacks, but United States forces in the seacoast states had been\r\ndriven back.\r\n\r\nHaverford ate his frozen foods sparingly, and spent long hours at the\r\nradio.\r\n\r\nOne by one his contacts were snuffed out. He ran down the lists in his\r\ncode book, calling people he hadn\'t buzzed in years, just trying to\r\nhear human voices again.\r\n\r\n"Come in, W3XFA. 

Come in, W3XFA.

"\r\n\r\nNo answer. None at all.\r\n\r\nThe aliens held all of Asia, most of Europe; he got a brief response\r\nfrom Belgium on the third day, but was unable to pick up the signal an\r\nhour later. An underground worker in an Iron Curtain country called him\r\nthat afternoon--and then he went. The marauders from space covered the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\nHaverford looked at his map. They were working in an ever-tightening\r\nring. 

Soon they would be in Chicago. Then the strength of his\r\nimprovised fortress would be sorely tested.\r\n\r\nBy the fourth day, he was down to just one contact--a man in upper\r\nIllinois, a ham operator out of a Chicago suburb.\r\n\r\n"You there, Haverford?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m here. 

What do you hear?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing. The aliens are everywhere. I can see them from my window,\r\nswarming in the streets. They\'ve won, all right. Mankind is defeated."\r\n\r\n"You can see them, eh? 

Must be a ghastly sight." Haverford\'s own window\r\nfaced the back.\r\n\r\n"It is. There must be millions of the ugly beasts, and not a human\r\nbeing in sight. Haverford, who ever expected it would come like this?"\r\n\r\n"No one did. 

No one ever dreamed of it."\r\n\r\n"They must breed fantastically rapidly if they can send an invasion\r\nforce of this size. Imagine it, Haverford--a living tide of Lanthaii\r\nspilling out from their home world, covering all of the universe and--"\r\n\r\n"Yes? I hear you," Haverford said.\r\n\r\n"Something outside my door. It\'s _them_, Haverford! It\'s them!"\r\n\r\nThe set went dead. Haverford stared dully at it for a moment, then\r\nturned it off. There was no one else to talk to. He was alone.\r\n\r\nHe was the last survivor. Unless there was someone else, cowering in a\r\nskyscraper basement somewhere, hiding in a thick field of corn--\r\n\r\nBut the Lanthaii were methodical killers. They had set out to\r\nexterminate the human race, and--\r\n\r\nHaverford stiffened. What was that scrabbling, scratching noise in the\r\nhall? It sounded like--\r\n\r\nHe knew what it was. The Lanthaii were coming. They were wiping out the\r\nstragglers now, the few like Haverford who had remained alive. They\r\nwere wiping the Earth clean of life, leaving it bare and ready for them.\r\n\r\nThe scraping at the door grew louder. The bolt strained; the hinges\r\nstarted to give. Haverford watched coldly, knowing that he hadn\'t done\r\nthe job well enough. They were going to be able to get through.\r\n\r\nA dark line appeared down the center of his door. It began to crack. It\r\nyielded.\r\n\r\nHaverford turned frantically to his radio set, desperately sending out\r\na call for help. But of course nobody heard him, nobody answered. He\r\nwas alone and he knew it. Except for _them_.\r\n\r\nHe wheeled to face them, to go down fighting. He looked in horror at\r\nthem--insects--huge, ugly, and alien. They came on. He backed to the\r\nwall. And in the last moment as time seemed to stand still he became\r\naware of an insignificant detail, laughable, yet tragically ironic.\r\nA fly buzzed around his head. An earth fly. A pitiful creature, a\r\nnothing--an insect.\r\n\r\nThe fly lighted on the floor a few feet ahead of him, crawling slowly\r\ntoward the alien horde pouring through the door. And the aliens broke\r\ntheir ranks, passing around the fly, almost respectfully, he thought.\r\nOr was it paternally?...\r\n\r\nThen they reached him.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK HOMECOMING HORDE ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
