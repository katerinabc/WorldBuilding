It is reasonable to expect that future psychiatrists will\r\n    know more about this borderline than the most learned doctors of\r\n    today. Yet now and again even the best of them may encounter\r\n    situations that defy all logic._\r\n\r\n\r\n texas\r\n  week\r\n\r\n _by ... Albert Hernhuter_\r\n\r\n\r\n Meeting the little man who isn\'t there is rated\r\n an horrendous experience. But discovery that the\r\n man _is_ there may be even worse.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe slick black car sped along the wide and straight street. It came to\r\na smooth stop in front of a clean white house. A man got out of the car\r\nand walked briskly to the door. Reaching out with a pink hand, he\r\npressed the doorbell with one well-manicured finger.\r\n\r\nThe door was answered by a housewife. She was wearing a white blouse, a\r\ngreen skirt and a green apron trimmed with white. 

Her feet were tucked\r\ninto orange slippers, her blonde hair was done up in a neat bun. She was\r\ndressed as the government had ordered for that week.\r\n\r\nThe man said, "You are Mrs. Christopher Nest?"\r\n\r\nThere was a trace of anxiety in her voice as she answered. "Yes. 

And you\r\nare...?"\r\n\r\n"My name is Maxwell Hanstark. As you may already know, I am the official\r\npsychiatrist for this district. My appointment will last until the end\r\nof this year."\r\n\r\nMrs. Nest invited him in. They stepped into a clean living-room. At one\r\nend was the television set, at the other end were several chairs. There\r\nwas nothing between the set and the chairs except a large grey rug\r\nwhich stretched from wall to wall. They walked to the chairs and sat\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n"Now, just what is the matter with your husband, Mrs. Nest?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Nest reached into a large bowl and absently picked up a piece of\r\nstale popcorn. She daintily placed it in her mouth and chewed\r\nthoughtfully before she answered.\r\n\r\n"I wish I knew. All he does all day long is sit in the backyard and\r\nstare at the grass. He insists that he is standing on top of a cliff."\r\n\r\nHanstark took out a small pad and a short ball-point pen. 

He wrote\r\nsomething down before he spoke again. "Is he violent? Did he get angry\r\nwhen you told him there was no cliff?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Nest was silent for a moment. 

A second piece of popcorn joined the\r\nfirst. Hanstark\'s pen was poised above the pad. 

"No. He didn\'t get\r\nviolent."\r\n\r\nHanstark wrote as he asked the next question. "Just what _was_ his\r\nreaction?"\r\n\r\n"He said _I_ must be crazy."\r\n\r\n"Were those his exact words?"\r\n\r\n"No. He said that I was"-- She thought for a moment--"loco. Yes, that\r\nwas the word."\r\n\r\n"Loco?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. He said it just like those cowboys on the television."\r\n\r\nHanstark looked puzzled. "Perhaps you had better tell me more about\r\nthis. When did he first start acting this way?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Nest glanced up at the television set, then back at Hanstark. "It\r\nwas right after Texas Week. You remember--they showed all of those old\r\ncowboy pictures."\r\n\r\nHanstark nodded.\r\n\r\n"Well, he stayed up every night watching them. Some nights he didn\'t\r\neven go to sleep. Even after the set was off, he sat in one of the\r\nchairs, just staring at the screen. This morning, when I got up, he\r\nwasn\'t in the house. I looked all over but I couldn\'t find him. I was\r\njust about ready to phone the police when I glanced out the window into\r\nthe backyard. And I saw him."\r\n\r\n"What was he doing?"\r\n\r\n"He was just sitting there in the middle of the yard, staring. I went\r\nout and tried to bring him into the house. He told me he had to watch\r\nfor someone. When I asked him what he was talking about he told me that\r\nI was crazy. That was when I phoned you, Mr. Hanstark."\r\n\r\n"A very wise move, Mrs. Nest. And would you show me where your husband\r\nis right now?"\r\n\r\nShe nodded her head and they both got up from the chairs. They walked\r\nthrough the dining-room and kitchen. On the back porch Hanstark came to\r\na halt.\r\n\r\n"You\'d better stay here, Mrs. Nest." He walked to the door and opened\r\nit.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Hanstark," Mrs. Nest called.\r\n\r\nHanstark turned and saw her standing next to the automatic washing\r\nmachine. "Yes?

"\r\n\r\n"Please be careful."\r\n\r\nHanstark smiled. "I shall be, Mrs. Nest."\r\n\r\nHe walked out the door and down three concrete steps. Looking a little\r\nto his right, he saw a man squatted on his heels. He walked up to the\r\nman. 

"You are Mr. Christopher Nest?"\r\n\r\nThe man looked up and stared for a moment at Hanstark. "Yep," he\r\nanswered. Then he turned and stared at the grass again.\r\n\r\n"And may I ask you what you are doing?"\r\n\r\nNest answered without looking up. "Guardin\' the pass."\r\n\r\nHanstark scribbled something in his notebook. "And why are you guarding\r\nthe pass?"\r\n\r\nNest rose to his feet and stared down at Hanstark. "Just what are you\r\naskin\' all of these questions for, stranger?"\r\n\r\nHanstark saw Nest was bigger than he and decided to play along for a\r\nwhile. After all, strategy ...\r\n\r\n"I\'m just interested in your welfare, Mr. Nest.

"\r\n\r\nNest shrugged his shoulders. He reached into his shirt pocket and pulled\r\nout a sack of tobacco and some paper. Holding a piece of paper in one\r\nhand, he carefully poured a little tobacco onto it. In one quick\r\nmovement he rolled the paper and tobacco into a perfect cylinder.\r\n\r\nHe put the sack of tobacco and paper back into his pocket and took out a\r\nwooden kitchen match. He scraped it to life on the sole of his shoe and\r\napplied the flame to the tip of the cigarette. He puffed it into life\r\nand threw the match away. It burned for a few moments in the moist\r\ngrass, then went out. A thin trail of smoke rose from it, and then was\r\ngone.\r\n\r\n"Why are you guarding the pass?" Hanstark asked again.\r\n\r\nNest resumed his crouch on the grass. "News is around that Dirty Dan the\r\ncattle rustler is gonna try to steal some of my cattle." He patted an\r\nimaginary holster at his side. 

"And I aim to stop him."\r\n\r\nHanstark thought for a moment. Strategy--he must use strategy ... "Mr.\r\nNest." He waited until Nest had turned to him. "Mr. 

Nest. What would you\r\nsay if I told you that there was no pass down there?"\r\n\r\n"Why shucks, pardner. I\'d say you\'d been chewin\' some loco weed."\r\n\r\n"And if I could prove it?"\r\n\r\nNest answered after a moment\'s pause. "Why then, I guess _I\'d_ be loco."\r\n\r\nHanstark thought it was going to be easy. 

"Mr. Nest, it is a well known\r\nfact that no one can walk in mid-air. Is that not true?"\r\n\r\nNest took a deep drag on his cigarette and blew the smoke out of his\r\nnostrils. "Shore."\r\n\r\n"Then if I were to walk out above your pass you\'d have to admit there is\r\nno pass."\r\n\r\n"Reckon so.

"\r\n\r\nHanstark began to walk in the direction of Nest\'s "cliff." Nest jumped\r\nto his feet and grabbed the official psychiatrist by the arm.\r\n\r\n"What\'re you tryin\' to do," Nest said angrily, "kill yourself?"\r\n\r\nHanstark shook free of his grasp. "Mr. Nest, I am not going to kill\r\nmyself. I am merely going to walk in that direction." He pointed to\r\nwhere the cliff was supposed to be. "To you it will look as if I were\r\nwalking in mid-air."\r\n\r\nNest dropped his hands to his sides. "Shucks, I don\'t care if you kill\r\nyourself. It\'s just that it\'s liable to make the cattle nervous."\r\n\r\nHanstark gave him a cold glare and began to walk. He took three paces\r\nand stopped. "You see, Mr. 

Nest. There is no cliff."\r\n\r\nNest looked at him and laughed. "You just take one more step and you\'ll\r\nfind there _is_ a cliff!"\r\n\r\nHanstark took another step--a long one. His face bore a surprised look\r\nas he disappeared beneath the grass. His screams could be heard for a\r\nmoment before he landed on the rocks below.\r\n\r\nNest walked to the edge of the cliff and looked down at the mangled\r\nbody. He took off his hat in respect. "Little feller had a lotta guts."\r\nThen he added, "Poor little feller."\r\n\r\nHe put his hat back on and looked down at the entrance to the valley. A\r\nhorse and rider appeared from behind several rocks.\r\n\r\n"Dirty Dan!" Nest exclaimed. He reached down and picked up his rifle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ January 1954.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
