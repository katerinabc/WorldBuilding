ROBLES, JR.\r\n\r\n\r\n _Seeing things? Don\'t go to an analyst--see\r\n the Commission--if it doesn\'t find you first!_\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, there was this song a few years back. 

You know the one. Phil\r\nHarris singing about a thing that you couldn\'t get rid of, no matter\r\nwhat you did, a thing so repulsive it made you a social outcast. Never\r\nthought I\'d see one, though. Dirty Pete found it.\r\n\r\nDon\'t rush me. I\'ll tell you about it.\r\n\r\nWe\'re hobos, understand? Now a hobo is a different breed of cat than\r\nyou think. Oh, people are getting educated to the idea that a hobo will\r\nwork and move on, whereas a tramp will mooch and move on, and a bum will\r\nmooch and hang around, but you still find folks who are ignorant enough\r\nto call us bums.\r\n\r\nWe\'re aristocrats, yes sir. If it wasn\'t for us, you wouldn\'t enjoy half\r\nthe little luxuries you do. Oh, don\'t believe me--talk to your experts.\r\nThey know that, without the migratory worker, most of the crops wouldn\'t\r\nget harvested. And, if I talk highfalutin\' once in a while, don\'t blame\r\nme. Associating with the Professor improves any man\'s vocabulary, in\r\nspite of themselves.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was the four of us, see? We\'d been kicking around together for\r\nlonger than I care to think about. There was the Professor and Dirty\r\nPete and Sacks and Eddie. I\'m Eddie. Nicknames are funny things. Take\r\nthe Professor--he was a real professor once, until he began hitting the\r\nbottle. Well, he lost his job, his home, his family, and his rep.\r\n\r\nOne morning, he wakes up on Skid Row without a nickel in his jeans and\r\nthe great-granddaddy of all hangovers. He comes to a decision. Either he\r\ncould make a man out of hisself, or he could die. Right then, dying\r\nlooked like the easiest thing to do, but it took more guts that he had\r\nto jump off a bridge, so he went on the Road instead.\r\n\r\nAfter he got over his shakes--and he sure had \'em bad--he decided that,\r\nif he never took another drink, it\'d be the best thing for him. So he\r\ndidn\'t. 

He had a kind of dignity, though, and he could really talk, so\r\nhe and I teamed up during the wheat harvest in South Dakota. We made all\r\nthe stops and, when we hit the peaches in California we picked up Sacks\r\nand Dirty Pete.\r\n\r\nSacks got his monicker because he never wore shoes. He claimed that\r\ngunny-sacks, wrapped around his feet and shins, gave as much protection\r\nand more freedom, and they were more comfortable, besides costing nix.\r\nSince we mostly bought our shoes at the dumps, at four bits a pair, you\r\nmight say he was stretching a point, but that\'s one of the laws of the\r\nRoad. You don\'t step on the other guy\'s corns, and he don\'t step on\r\nyours.\r\n\r\nSo guess why Dirty Pete was called that. Yeah. He hadn\'t taken a bath\r\nsince \'forty-six, when he got out of the army, and he didn\'t figure on\r\never takin\' another. He was a damn\' good worker, though, and nobody\'d\r\never try anything with him around. He wasn\'t any bigger than a Mack\r\ntruck. Besides, he was quiet.\r\n\r\nOh, sure. You wanna know why I\'m on the Road. 

Well, it happens I like\r\nwhiskers. Trouble is, they\'re not fashionable, unless you\'re some kind\r\nof an artist, which I\'m not. You know, social disapproval. 

I didn\'t have\r\nthe guts to face it, so I lit out. Nobody cares on the Road what you do,\r\nso I was okay with my belt-length beard.\r\n\r\nA beard\'s an enjoyable thing, too. There\'s a certain kind of thrill you\r\nget from stroking it, and feeling its silkiness run through your\r\nfingers. And besides, combing it, and keeping it free of burrs, snarls\r\nand tangles, sort of keeps your spare moments so full that the devil\r\ndon\'t find any idle time to put your hands to work in. If you ask me, I\r\nthink that the razor has been the downfall of society. And I\'m willing\r\nto bet I have plenty of company with the same opinion.\r\n\r\nShow me a man who doesn\'t let his beard grow once in a while, even if\r\nit\'s only for a day or so, and you\'ve shown me a man who thinks more of\r\nsocial pressure than he does of his own comfort. And show me a man who\r\nsays he likes to shave, and you\'ve shown me a man who is either a liar\r\nor is asking for punishment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat\'s enough about us. Now to get on with the story. You know, if the\r\nProfessor hadn\'t been around, there would probably have been murder done\r\nover the Thing, or at least our little group would\'ve split up, \'cause\r\nnone of us had the brains to figure it out.\r\n\r\nPete\'s an expert scrounger. His eyes are sharp, and he\'s always on the\r\nlookout for a salable piece of goods, even if he can only get a nickel\r\nfor it. One night, we\'re sitting in a jungle near Sacramento, trying to\r\nfigure out whether to go north for the grapes, or south for the grapes.\r\nThey\'re all over California, you know, and they pay pretty well.\r\n\r\nPete, as usual, is out looking, and pretty soon he comes back into camp\r\nwith this thing in his hand. He handles it like it was hot, but he\'s\r\npleased he\'s found it, because he hopes to merchandise it. So he walks\r\nup to me, and says, "Hey, Eddie. What\'ll you gimme for this, huh?"\r\n\r\nI say, "Get that to hell away from me! I\'ll give you a swift kick in the\r\npants if you don\'t."\r\n\r\nHe looks real surprised. He says, "Huh, I thought maybe you could use\r\nit."\r\n\r\nI get up on my feet. I say, real low and careful, because maybe he\'s\r\njoking, "Look, Pete--you oughtta know by this time, I _like_ my beard.\r\nNow will you go away?"\r\n\r\nHe mooches off, looking like I\'d kicked him, and goes over to the\r\nProfessor. I figure maybe the Professor could use it, so I listen. The\r\nProf looks like he was being offered a live rattlesnake.\r\n\r\n"No, thanks, really, Pete. I have resolved never to touch it again. 

I\r\nhope you don\'t mind."\r\n\r\nWell, for some reason Pete don\'t look pleased, and he\'s real unhappy by\r\nthis time, but he tries again.\r\n\r\n"Hey, Sacks, what\'ll you gimme for--"\r\n\r\nHe don\'t get a chance to finish. I\'m only listening with half an ear,\r\nbut I\'m so surprised I stand up like I been stuck with a pin. Sacks\r\nsays, "Whatinell would I do with a left shoe? You know I don\'t use \'em."\r\n\r\nPete looks at the thing in his hand, and the Prof and I go over there.\r\n\r\nThe Professor looks at the thing real carefully and speaks up. "Say,\r\nPete, look at that thing and tell me what it is."\r\n\r\n"Why, it\'s a brand new bar of soap, of course. I don\'t use it, but one\r\nof you might want to. What\'s all the beef about?"\r\n\r\n"Soap?" 

I say. "Why, you poor fish, something must have happened to your\r\neyes. When you offered me that straight razor, I thought you\'d gone off\r\nyour nut. Now I _know_ it."\r\n\r\nThe Professor interrupts. He looks excited. 

"Wait a minute, Eddie. To me\r\nthat item looks exactly like a full fifth of Old Harvester, 100 proof.\r\nUsed to be my favorite, before I became an abstainer. To Pete, it looks\r\nlike soap. To you, it looks like a straight razor while, to Sacks, it\r\nresembles a shoe. Does that give you any ideas?"\r\n\r\n"Means we\'re all having hallucinations," I grunts.\r\n\r\n"Exactly. Pete, was there anything else in the location where you found\r\nthis thing?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing but some scrap tin."\r\n\r\n"Show us."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo, the four of us wanders across the field and, sure enough, there was\r\nthis silly-looking object lying there. It was about eighteen or twenty\r\nfeet across, and two feet thick, and I nearly made a fool of myself. I\r\nalmost screamed when I saw six straight razors _crawling_ out of a hole\r\nin its side.\r\n\r\nThe Professor whistled. "Grab them, boys. 

We want them."\r\n\r\nWell, Sacks sacrifices one of his sacks, and we rounded up fifteen of\r\nthe useless things. We went back to the jungle, where the Prof explained\r\nit.\r\n\r\n"Look, fellows, suppose you were a being from another planet that wanted\r\nto take over here. Suppose, further, that you were rather small and\r\nrelatively defenseless. To finish the suppositions, suppose you were a\r\npositive telepath, with not only the ability to read minds, but also the\r\nability to create visual and tactile hallucinations. How would you\r\nprotect yourself?"\r\n\r\nA light began to dawn, but I didn\'t say a word about it.\r\n\r\nThe Professor continued. "If you could do all this, you\'d make yourself\r\nlook just as useless as possible. 

To Pete, you\'d look like a bar of\r\nsoap, because he never uses the stuff. To Sacks, you\'d look like a shoe,\r\nbecause his dislike for shoes is evident in his mind. To Eddie, who is\r\nproud of his beard, you\'d look like a razor, while to me, you\'d look\r\nlike a bottle of booze, because I dislike its effects intensely. In\r\nother words, you would assume an imposture that would assure you\'d never\r\nbe picked up, except by someone like Pete, who would see in you a\r\nsalable item, even though not a usable one. It may be, Pete, that you\r\nhave saved the world."\r\n\r\nSo, that\'s the story. We\'re all still on the Road, of course, but now we\r\nare the "Commission for the Investigation of Extraterrestrial Invasion."\r\nCongress named us as that, when we got the data to them.\r\n\r\nNow, Mr. Mayor, you see our problem. 

Have your citizens seen anything\r\naround that they don\'t want? If they have, we want to look at it.\r\n\r\n                                               --EDWARD G.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
