Dee had just spoken through\r\nclenched teeth:\r\n\r\n"I never knew I could hate a person the way I hate you.

"\r\n\r\n"I consider that an honor!" Frank snapped back.\r\n\r\nThen the music on the radio was cut off and the announcement was\r\nmade--in the calm, impersonal voice of the announcer that gave it a\r\nflavor of grotesque unreality....\r\n\r\n"--and so, although the discovery of the celestial interloper was made\r\nby astronomers some time ago, the announcement was delayed until all\r\ndoubt as to its orbit had been dispelled. Thus, a direct and dismal\r\nstatement becomes a matter of necessity--the earth is doomed--"\r\n\r\nFrank and Dee stared mutely at one another, trying to comprehend. "It\'s\r\nsome kind of a gag," Frank said.\r\n\r\nDee shook her head. "No--that was John Kalmus, the Green Network\r\ncommentator who cut in. He wouldn\'t be a party to any hoax."\r\n\r\nFrank knew this of course, but the destruction of the world was a\r\npretty big lump to swallow in a matter of seconds. They continued\r\nto stare at each other, taking the rest of the story into their\r\nnumbed minds. The end would come at exactly 1:42 on Sunday. Prior\r\nto that time, there would be vast weather disturbances and tidal\r\ncatastrophies the world over. But these would be far milder than what\r\nwould ordinarily be expected because the comet was moving at such a\r\ntremendous rate of speed. There would be no long-drawn out suffering.\r\n\r\n"At least that\'s a blessing," Dee said.\r\n\r\n"Uh-huh. Say--I\'ll bet the churches will be crowded."\r\n\r\n"No doubt." Dee paused, and added, "How long since we\'ve been to\r\nchurch, Frank?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere had been a cabinet meeting and now the President of the United\r\nStates was seated alone in his study. He picked up his phone and asked,\r\n"How about that call to the Kremlin? Why the delay?"\r\n\r\nThe operator said, "The Premier was busy on the phone--not taking any\r\ncalls, but it seems he was trying to get through to you. May I connect\r\nhim, sir?"\r\n\r\n"By all means."\r\n\r\nThe normally harsh voice of the Russian Premier was oddly quiet and\r\npensive. "Mr. President?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Premier. I was trying to get through to you."\r\n\r\n"They told me. How--how are things there? How are your people taking it\r\nin the United States?"\r\n\r\n"Very well. They are stunned, naturally, and I\'m sure quite a few of\r\nthem don\'t believe it. It will take a little time."\r\n\r\nThe Russian Premier chuckled with a note of wistfulness. "That\'s\r\nexactly what they will have--very little time."\r\n\r\n"And your people--?"\r\n\r\n"We haven\'t told them. We thought it best."\r\n\r\nThe President sighed. "We stick to our ideologies to the very end,\r\ndon\'t we?"\r\n\r\n"Policy can\'t be changed overnight. Yet great strides can be made."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I understand you."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll try to clarify. We finished our public statement Monday, setting\r\ndown our position on The Stockholm Conference last month."\r\n\r\n"The conference was a great disappointment to me--to you also, I\r\nimagine."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and our public statement was, well, pretty bleak, but I\'m\r\nchanging it. I\'m in the middle of rewriting it now."\r\n\r\n"I\'d like to sit down with you and perhaps readjust some of our own\r\ndemands."\r\n\r\n"I\'d like to have you."\r\n\r\n"No time now, of course."\r\n\r\n"No, in fact the rewriting may seem futile to you but it gives me great\r\nsatisfaction. A nice way to end a political career."\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you call me back and read it to me when you\'ve finished?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll do that. Goodbye Mr. 

President."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrank and Dee Allison walked hand in hand down the street. Dee had been\r\ncrying but now her tears had been dried and her expression was calm.\r\nThere was a wistful light in her eyes. "It could have been so much\r\ndifferent, Frank."\r\n\r\n"Yes darling. My fault. It was my damn temper."\r\n\r\n"But I was always ready to snarl back. A wife\'s job is to--"\r\n\r\nHe squeezed her hand. "Are you afraid, baby?"\r\n\r\n"No--no. 

I won\'t be afraid as long as you\'re there to hold my hand."\r\n\r\nHe put his arm around her shoulders and drew her close and they walked\r\nwith the other people toward the Church.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States put through a call to the Premier\r\nof Russia. Connections clicked into place across half a world and the\r\nRussian operator\'s voice came through warm and cordial. "Of course, Mr.\r\nPresident. The Premier\'s wire is always open to you. I\'ll ring him."\r\n\r\nThe phone was lifted instantly. "Mr. 

President! How nice of you to\r\ncall!"\r\n\r\n"Our previous conversation set me thinking, Mr. Premier. I want to be a\r\npart of your inspiring idea. So I\'m rewriting our own statement and I\r\nsuggest we make a joint public release. I think it will help the people\r\nof the world to face the end with greater dignity. The _knowing_--I\r\nthink--will help.

"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure it will. How soon will your draft be finished?"\r\n\r\n"Can you give me another two hours?"\r\n\r\n"Of course. Ring me when you\'re ready. Perhaps we can set up an\r\ninternational television hookup and appear together."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure we can."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrank and Dee Allison came out of church bringing some of the peace\r\nand the strength with them. Dee said, "I\'d like to see my mother for a\r\nlittle while before--before--"\r\n\r\nFrank nodded. "Of course. 

And I think you should drop in on her alone."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no--I--"\r\n\r\n"A goodbye like this one should be said alone. You go up. I\'ll give you\r\nfifteen minutes and then call for you."\r\n\r\nDee\'s eyes were misty. "You\'re so understanding. Oh, why couldn\'t we\r\nhave--"\r\n\r\nFrank grinned. "Come on, angel. 

Heads up. 

Eyes bright."\r\n\r\nThey walked up the street, others around them going quietly about their\r\nbusiness. The people were very calm.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe conference of astronomers and scientists realized their ghastly\r\nblunder at 11:59 a.m. For a long moment, there was stunned silence in\r\nthe room. None of them could believe that such a progressive series of\r\nerrors could have been passed from man to man and been added to by\r\neach. Through every mind went the dread of what would come out of this.\r\nIn the future it would be called the greatest hoax of all time. There\r\nwould be gigantic investigations. Possibly a goat would have to be\r\nfound. The world would never believe the truth.\r\n\r\n"We might as well make the announcement," someone said.\r\n\r\n"You make it," another scientist said. "I\'m leaving for the North Pole."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrank Allison heard the announcement from a loudspeaker in a store\r\nwindow on his sixth trip around the block. He\'d been walking slowly,\r\ndeep in his own thoughts and regrets--giving Dee a little more time\r\nwith her mother. Then--\r\n\r\n"--so the great danger is passed, ladies and gentlemen. 

The why and\r\nthe wherefore of it is not known at this time. We are only sure of one\r\nthing: The comet will swing away into space. Rumor has it that the size\r\nof the invading body was what threw our scientists off. But whether\r\nthe earlier announcement was sincere or merely a cruel joke will not\r\nbe known immediately. The main thing is to be thankful that an error\r\nexisted--whatever its cause--"\r\n\r\nFrank straightened his shoulders, turned and started briskly up the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States put a call through to the Russian\r\nPremier. He awaited expectantly with the phone in his hand. But the\r\nconnections slipped into place slowly and five minutes later a voice\r\ncame across half a world. "The Premier is busy. Please inform the\r\nPresident of the United States that the Premier is engaged. Inform the\r\nPresident that I am able to connect him with the Premier\'s secretary.\r\nAsk him if that will be satisfactory."\r\n\r\nThe frost in the voice seemed to chill the President\'s ear. "I will\r\ntalk to the Premier\'s secretary."\r\n\r\nThe Secretary\'s voice was careful, guarded. "May I help you, Mr.\r\nPresident?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you can. I had a conversation with the Premier a little over\r\nan hour ago. We were planning a joint statement--a joint television\r\nappearance."\r\n\r\nThe secretary\'s voice stiffened. "I\'m sorry, but I know of no such\r\nstatement nor of any such plans on the part of the Premier.\'"\r\n\r\n"May I speak to the Premier?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry. The Premier has left on an extended vacation."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry too," the President said, and cradled the phone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDee Allison sat tight-eyed staring out the window. Her handkerchief was\r\nballed into a wad in her hand. "He\'s so cruel--so thoughtless," she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nHer mother regarded her with resignation. "What do you want me to tell\r\nhim when he comes?"\r\n\r\n"Tell him I never want to see him again!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrank Allison got as far as the lobby of the building in which Mrs.\r\nGregg, Dee\'s mother, lived. He raised his hand and his finger was\r\ninches from the bell. Then he doubled the hand into a fist and thrust\r\nit into his pocket. "The hell with it!" 

he growled. 

"If she wants to\r\nsee me, she knows where to find me." He turned and strode out of the\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States had sat staring into space for a\r\nlong time. A sound caused him to look up. His secretary stood by the\r\ndesk. "Yes?"\r\n\r\n"This new statement you just prepared, Mr. President. 

I\'m not entirely\r\nclear on how you plan to use it--what should I do?"\r\n\r\n"Tear it up," the President said wearily, "and throw it in the\r\nwastebasket. 

Things are now back to normal."\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK DAY OF THE COMET ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\xe2\x80\x99s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
