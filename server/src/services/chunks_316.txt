It can lead to complications....\r\n\r\n    _Chicago\'s own Mark Reinsberg, associated with Shasta Publishers,\r\n    the SF house, there, makes a first appearance in these pages\r\n    with this quiet little story of a susceptible trucker--galactic\r\n    style--who once swore by Mattapenny\'s otherwise so dependable\r\n    GALACTIC GUIDEBOOK._\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n                   Fantastic Universe December 1956.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSex and space don\'t mix. And Mattapenny\'s _Galactic Guidebook_ can\'t be\r\ntrusted.\r\n\r\nIf you doubt either proposition, ask Bill Brack. It\'s hard to tell\r\nwhat he thought about women, but all space truckers used to look upon\r\nMattapenny\'s little red book as a sort of interstellar Bible.\r\n\r\n"Looking for a planet to stop over at?" they\'d say. 

"Place to get good\r\nmeals? Decent room for the night? You can\'t go wrong with Mattapenny!"\r\n\r\nBrack did.\r\n\r\nYou see, the _Galactic Guidebook_ lists Corbie as one of the five small\r\nfuel stations sharing the outer-most orbit of the Dryodean planetary\r\nsystem. The latest edition still gives Hotel Eros two asterisks.\r\n\r\nNow, two asterisks (**) is supposed to mean "Plain but fairly\r\ncomfortable".\r\n\r\n"Sure," says Brack, "the hotel may lack an up-to-date Dreamawake or a\r\nTime-conditioner, but at least you expect your room to have a Vibrobath\r\nand controllable gravity."\r\n\r\nNone of this at the Hotel Eros. Brack shakes his head complainingly.\r\n"You sleep in a primitive 7/8G-bed. You wash yourself with\r\nold-fashioned magnetic water. And oxygen service costs 10% extra."\r\n\r\nSome people ask: "Then why in the world did you stay there?"\r\n\r\n"Had to," Bill answers. "I was hauling out of Dryod-7 with a cargo\r\nof deluplasm. Damn valuable stuff, consigned to Hesdin-2. Well, I\'d\r\nfigured the time a little wrong, and it left me with twelve hours\r\nto kill before our convoy jumped off. And you know how it is. I was\r\nfacing three weeks of interstellar rations, and I had a sudden yen\r\nfor nonsynthetic food. So I looked in the guidebook, and there was\r\nCorbie...."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBrack was disappointed from the start. When he sat at a table of the\r\nhotel restaurant and studied the menu, he saw it was all synthetics.\r\n\r\n"Blast it!" he barked into the table phone, "haven\'t you anything else?"\r\n\r\n"I understand how you feel, mister." It was a live human female voice\r\nthat answered, not the usual robot. "Hold on. 

I\'ll come out and see if\r\nI can help you."\r\n\r\nThrough the kitchen door emerged a young girl, short and white-skinned,\r\nbut very well proportioned.\r\n\r\n"Outbound?" she queried. Her pretty face was clouded by an unhappy\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\n"Yes, and I wanted something with a little taste to it, a little\r\nsubstance."\r\n\r\n"Such as what?" said the girl, tossing her long blond hair.\r\n\r\nBrack looked at the girl carnivorously. "A steak."\r\n\r\nShe smiled sympathetically. "We haven\'t anything of that sort. 

Sorry."\r\nShe stared at him with light blue eyes the color of moonstones. "How do\r\nyou happen to land at this miserable place? Fuel?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m early for my convoy."\r\n\r\nBrack stared at the girl\'s face and he could see it was the mask of\r\nsome hidden, tragic emotion.\r\n\r\n"You weren\'t thinking of staying at the Hotel Eros?" she inquired in a\r\nvoice edged with repugnance.\r\n\r\n"Well, I do have about twelve hours."\r\n\r\nThe girl was emphatic. "Take my advice, mister. Spend them in your\r\nship."\r\n\r\nA man\'s voice crackled over the table phone. "Esther!"\r\n\r\nShe looked startled. 

"Yes?" she said, leaning over the table to speak\r\ninto the phone.\r\n\r\n(\'Beautiful!\' thought Brack. \'She must have some Earth-blood in her\r\nveins.\')\r\n\r\nThe man\'s voice was angry, strident. "Don\'t gab with the customers!"\r\n\r\nEsther stood up, a blush of embarrassment on her milky-white cheeks.\r\n\r\n"Your order, please?" she said to Brack, stiffly.\r\n\r\nThe trucker put his big, brown-colored hand over the phone. "Who\'s\r\nthat character?" he asked with distaste. "The boss?"\r\n\r\nThe girl nodded unhappily. "I didn\'t realize he was listening."\r\n\r\n"Sounds like a tyrant." Brack uncovered the phone. "What\'s the closest\r\nthing you have to beefsteak?"\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you try some of our roasted pradolan? It\'s quite good," she\r\nadded for the boss\'s benefit. "Specialty of the house."\r\n\r\n"There\'s just one thing I want to know," said Brack. "Is it synthetic?"\r\n\r\nThe girl smiled sadly. "I\'d do anything for some real food myself. I\r\nhaven\'t left Corbie in seven years."\r\n\r\n"What makes you stick around a place like this? 

Married?"\r\n\r\n"No. My father owns the Eros."\r\n\r\n"You\'re free, brown and twenty-one," said Brack somewhat inaccurately.\r\n"He can\'t make you stay if you want to leave."\r\n\r\nEsther waved warningly at the table phone and Brack again covered it\r\nwith his hand.\r\n\r\n"Maybe he can\'t legally, but there\'s only one passenger ship between\r\nhere and the planets every year, and they\'ve refused me a ticket twice\r\nnow."\r\n\r\n"Sounds pretty rotten to me," said the trucker. "Well, what if you got\r\nmarried to some guy? Then he couldn\'t--"\r\n\r\nA heavy-set white man, bald and bullet-headed, strode out of the\r\nkitchen and seized the girl roughly by the arm.\r\n\r\n"Now I told you not to gab with the customers and I meant it!" he\r\nsnarled. "You get back there in the kitchen where you belong!"\r\n\r\nShe tried to wrench free of his grip. "Take your hands off me!"\r\n\r\nSlap! He batted her across the cheek with his open hand and she\r\nstaggered from the blow. "No back talk, young lady! 

Now, git!"\r\n\r\nThe trucker half rose from his seat, his fists clenched, but it was\r\nover too quickly for him to intervene. And after all, he reflected\r\nlater while eating the pradolan roast, the man was her father.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith some misgivings, Brack checked into the hotel. It was a tiny\r\ninstallation--perhaps nine or ten rooms. His own cubicle was a drab\r\naffair, with neither entertainment screen nor sleep-inducer.\r\n\r\nHe had just tested the 7/8G-bed with disgust when there was a buzz at\r\nthe door. It was Esther, holding some linens.\r\n\r\n"They have you doing everything around here," Brack said with empathy.\r\n"What are these?"\r\n\r\n"Towels. You use them after you wash.

"\r\n\r\n"Boy, this sure is ancient!"\r\n\r\nEsther\'s eyes betrayed deep torment. "I know. I would do anything to\r\nget away from this place."\r\n\r\nShe put the towels in a rack. The trucker was lying on the bed,\r\ncontemplating the girl\'s deft, graceful movements.\r\n\r\n"Listen," he said, "why wait for a passenger ship? Why not arrange\r\nsecretly with one of the cargo ships that stop here? I know if I was\r\ninbound--"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t even say it!" 

she expostulated. "It\'s very kind of you, but\r\ncertainly you\'ve heard of the Pledge Act? My father could prosecute\r\nany cargo ship, no matter where it landed in the planets. You know,\r\nunlicensed transport of people."\r\n\r\nShe paused to look at herself in a mirror above the washstand. Brack\'s\r\neyes were on her bare, marble-white shoulders, her finely sculptured\r\nbosom. She sighed.\r\n\r\n"No, my only chance is to get away from the Dryodean System altogether.\r\nIf I go to another star--where the Pledge Act wasn\'t even heard of--"\r\n\r\nShe brushed back her long blond hair with an unconscious gesture, like\r\na maiden getting out of a degravity pool.\r\n\r\nBrack said thoughtfully: "Esther, if you\'re really determined to get\r\naway from here, maybe I can help you. I\'m taking a cargo to Hesdin.\r\nYour old man couldn\'t reach you there, or prove anything against me,\r\neither."\r\n\r\nThe girl\'s moonstone eyes flared up in hope, but she hesitated. "I\r\ndon\'t have very much money. I couldn\'t make it worth your while,\r\nfinancially."\r\n\r\n"That part is unimportant. The thing for you to consider is the\r\nsituation on Hesdin-2. It\'s a new colony; life there is pretty\r\nprimitive."\r\n\r\nEsther waved at the room. "Any more so than here?"\r\n\r\nBrack grinned. "Not much more. But then also, you\'ve got to remember\r\nthat it\'s a three-week trip. Pretty monotonous. 

Just the two of us."\r\n\r\nShe looked him in the eyes with understanding.\r\n\r\n"I\'d try not to get in the way."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey met in the middle of the night at Brack\'s ship. Working slowly,\r\nsoundlessly, they opened a cargo case and removed enough unit boxes to\r\nmake room for the girl.\r\n\r\nEsther settled down in the container.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid that isn\'t too comfortable," Brack apologized, "but you\'ll\r\nonly have to put up with it four hours. I take off at seven.

"\r\n\r\n"That\'s all right, Bill. Just so there\'s no delay. My father expects me\r\nto open the dining room at seven."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll be ten million miles away before he misses you," said Brack. He\r\nput the top on loosely, faking the straps across the cover, so the\r\ngirl could breathe.\r\n\r\nIn his room again, Brack lay with arms folded under his head, thinking\r\nhoneyed thoughts. He would have Esther\'s pleasant company. 

His cargo\r\nwas a valuable one. Two-thirds of the receipts on Hesdin-2 would\r\nrepresent sheer profit. Perhaps it would be enough to establish him\r\nin some kind of a local freight business. Esther could make a man a\r\nwonderful partner. Lovely, delectable girl!\r\n\r\nHe reminded himself that they were not safely away from Corbie yet, and\r\nhe passed the remaining hours in the Hotel Eros sleeplessly anxious.\r\n\r\nBrack delayed going to his ship until the last minute before takeoff\r\ntime. Then, as he half-feared, he saw a customs officer standing beside\r\nthe airlock.\r\n\r\nThe trucker tried taking the offensive. "Gosh, I\'ll be late for my\r\nconvoy if I don\'t leave right away."\r\n\r\n"Sorry, sir, but I\'ll have to inspect your ship." He was a burly,\r\ntough-looking character in pale green uniform, blocking the doorway\r\nwith a flatfooted, wrestling stance.\r\n\r\nBrack sensed that a contest of fists might not end in his favor. He\r\nunlocked the entrance and waved the official in with reluctance. "Take\r\na look, but I\'ve already gone through customs on Dryod-7. I can show\r\nyou my clearance."\r\n\r\n"This isn\'t customs exactly," said the man. "We\'re searching for a\r\nperson."\r\n\r\n"A person?" (The old man sure kept a close watch on his daughter.) "I\'m\r\nthe only person aboard this ship."\r\n\r\nThe customs official remained polite. "Yes, I understand that, sir. 

But\r\nMr. Eros\' daughter is missing. He thinks she may have stowed away on\r\nyour ship."\r\n\r\n"Impossible! I had the ship locked."\r\n\r\nThey stepped into the pilot\'s cabin, a tetrahexahedron-shaped room\r\ncrowded with multiple-monitor screens of an astrogation-computer. Brack\r\nthrew the ignition switch to start the buildup in the ship\'s nuclear\r\nengine.\r\n\r\n"What is your cargo?" the customs man demanded.\r\n\r\n"Fifteen cases of deluplasm," said Brack with unfeigned anxiety.\r\n\r\nThe official debated with himself. "I believe it would be best if I\r\nopened the cases.

"\r\n\r\nBrack looked at his watch with desperation. "But we don\'t have time!\r\nThat would take at least a half-hour! I\'d miss the other ships! And\r\nyou know what that would mean. I couldn\'t navigate interstellar space\r\nalone, not at a hundred times the speed of light. I\'d be stuck here in\r\nthe Dryodean System until the next fleet left. That might be months!"\r\n\r\nHe grabbed the official\'s arm. "Please, fellow, give me a break!

"\r\n\r\nThe customs man considered. "Well, since the ship was locked, it\r\ndoes seem unlikely that the girl has hidden herself here. I certainly\r\nwouldn\'t want you to lose your convoy."\r\n\r\nBrack smiled in relief and started the rocket engine secondaries.\r\n\r\n"Thanks a million."\r\n\r\n"But just to protect me in case the girl has run off somewhere--I want\r\nyou to sign this form."\r\n\r\nBrack felt a twinge of suspicion, but more of a twinge of haste. "Sure.\r\nWhat kind of a form is this?"\r\n\r\n"It simply says that I inspected each case in your presence and found\r\nthe contents identical with your bill of lading. This girl has made\r\nseveral attempts to leave Corbie in the past. This is my protection in\r\ncase she\'s finally succeeded."\r\n\r\nThe customs officer made the slightest perceptible wink. Brack signed.\r\n\r\nHe took off immediately. He was already ten minutes late. He had to\r\nblast at top speed for the next hour, continually correcting his\r\nnavigation. There was no time to go back and let Esther out of the\r\ncargo room. He had to remain at the controls, feeding data into the\r\ncomputer, modifying course as solutions flashed on the screens.\r\n\r\nFinally, Brack sighted the convoy and maneuvered into pattern just as\r\nthe fleet was dematerializing into supra-space. He set his ship on\r\npantagraph-automatic with the lead navigator, then hastened to the\r\ncargo hold.\r\n\r\nEsther was not there. Neither were ten of the fifteen cases of\r\ndeluplasm. Two-thirds of his cargo had been hijacked.\r\n\r\nIt was of course pointless for Brack to turn around and raise hell on\r\nCorbie. With the waiver he\'d signed for the customs officer, he\'d only\r\nlook ridiculous. All he could do was continue to Hesdin-2 with his\r\none-third cargo. At least he\'d break even on the trip; Esther and her\r\nco-workers had been that considerate.\r\n\r\nNo, sex and space don\'t mix.\r\n\r\nAnd it\'s high time that Mr. Mattapenny deleted the Hotel Eros (**) from\r\nhis little red guidebook.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE SATELLITE-KEEPER\'S DAUGHTER ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\xe2\x80\x99s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
