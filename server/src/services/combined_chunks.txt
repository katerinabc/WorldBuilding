He could have\r\nleaned over and dammed the river below with a finger. 

He sat on top of\r\nthe mountain, and his beard in the wind was a white flag.\r\n\r\nAcross the plains, as he watched, there were fires glowing, and the\r\nmountain under him trembled from explosions a thousand miles away. He\r\nbent his head, and a muffled cry reverberated down the hillside and\r\nthrough the valley.\r\n\r\nA smaller figure appeared beside him, looking sad.\r\n\r\n"Try again, father," the smaller one said.\r\n\r\nThe old one shook his head. "It would be the same.

"\r\n\r\n"Give them another chance."\r\n\r\n"They would do it again.

"\r\n\r\n"Just once more."\r\n\r\nThe old one shook his head again, and for a while they sat, and they\r\nwatched the destruction. The fires burned higher, and the explosions\r\nshook their mountain more roughly.\r\n\r\nAt last, at the end, the old one reached down and scooped up some clay\r\nfrom the bank of the river. He held it in a huge, gentle hand, and the\r\nyounger one smiled.\r\n\r\n"You are good to give them another chance, father.

"\r\n\r\n"Not them," said the old one.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" the son asked, wonderingly.\r\n\r\n"Something else," the majestic figure answered, starting to knead the\r\nclay.

Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are\r\nparticularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.\r\nCompliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable\r\neffort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these\r\nrequirements. 

We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not\r\nreceived written confirmation of compliance.

Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with\r\nanyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm\r\neBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions,\r\nall of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright\r\nnotice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance\r\nwith any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook\xe2\x80\x99s eBook\r\nnumber, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed\r\n(zipped), HTML and others.\r\n\r\nCorrected _editions_ of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the\r\nold filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.\r\n_Versions_ based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\r\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n\r\n    http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how\r\nto make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation,\r\nhow to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email\r\nnewsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***FINIS***\r\n'

It exists because of the\r\nefforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks\r\nof life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance\r\nthey need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\xe2\x80\x99s goals and ensuring\r\nthat the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for\r\ngenerations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To learn more about the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations\r\ncan help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation web page at\r\nhttp://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of\r\nMississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service.\r\nThe Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541.\r\nIts 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are\r\nparticularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.\r\nCompliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable\r\neffort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these\r\nrequirements. 

We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not\r\nreceived written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or\r\ndetermine the status of compliance for any particular state visit\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have\r\nnot met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against\r\naccepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us\r\nwith offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any\r\nstatements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the\r\nUnited States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods\r\nand addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including\r\nchecks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please\r\nvisit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n      General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with\r\nanyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm\r\neBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions,\r\nall of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright\r\nnotice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance\r\nwith any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook\xe2\x80\x99s eBook\r\nnumber, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed\r\n(zipped), HTML and others.\r\n\r\nCorrected _editions_ of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the\r\nold filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.\r\n_Versions_ based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\r\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n\r\n    http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how\r\nto make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation,\r\nhow to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email\r\nnewsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***FINIS***\r\n'

Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are\r\nparticularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.\r\nCompliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable\r\neffort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these\r\nrequirements. 

We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not\r\nreceived written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or\r\ndetermine the status of compliance for any particular state visit\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have\r\nnot met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against\r\naccepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us\r\nwith offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any\r\nstatements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the\r\nUnited States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods\r\nand addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including\r\nchecks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please\r\nvisit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n      General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with\r\nanyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm\r\neBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions,\r\nall of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright\r\nnotice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance\r\nwith any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook\xe2\x80\x99s eBook\r\nnumber, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed\r\n(zipped), HTML and others.\r\n\r\nCorrected _editions_ of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the\r\nold filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.\r\n_Versions_ based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\r\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n\r\n    http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how\r\nto make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation,\r\nhow to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email\r\nnewsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***FINIS***\r\n'

Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are\r\nparticularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.\r\nCompliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable\r\neffort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these\r\nrequirements. 

We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not\r\nreceived written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or\r\ndetermine the status of compliance for any particular state visit\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have\r\nnot met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against\r\naccepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us\r\nwith offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any\r\nstatements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the\r\nUnited States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods\r\nand addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including\r\nchecks, online payments and credit card donations.

Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with\r\nanyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm\r\neBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions,\r\nall of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright\r\nnotice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance\r\nwith any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook\xe2\x80\x99s eBook\r\nnumber, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed\r\n(zipped), HTML and others.\r\n\r\nCorrected _editions_ of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the\r\nold filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.\r\n_Versions_ based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\r\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n\r\n    http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how\r\nto make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation,\r\nhow to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email\r\nnewsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***FINIS***\r\n'

To learn more about the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations\r\ncan help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation web page at\r\nhttp://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of\r\nMississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service.\r\nThe Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541.\r\nIts 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf. Contributions to the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full\r\nextent permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\xe2\x80\x99s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr.\r\nS. 

Fairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations. Its business office is located at 809 North\r\n1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are\r\nparticularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.\r\nCompliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable\r\neffort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these\r\nrequirements. 

We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not\r\nreceived written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or\r\ndetermine the status of compliance for any particular state visit\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have\r\nnot met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against\r\naccepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us\r\nwith offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any\r\nstatements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the\r\nUnited States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods\r\nand addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including\r\nchecks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please\r\nvisit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n      General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with\r\nanyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm\r\neBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions,\r\nall of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright\r\nnotice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance\r\nwith any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook\xe2\x80\x99s eBook\r\nnumber, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed\r\n(zipped), HTML and others.\r\n\r\nCorrected _editions_ of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the\r\nold filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.\r\n_Versions_ based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\r\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n\r\n    http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how\r\nto make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation,\r\nhow to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email\r\nnewsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***FINIS***\r\n'

Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are\r\nparticularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.\r\nCompliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable\r\neffort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these\r\nrequirements. 

We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not\r\nreceived written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or\r\ndetermine the status of compliance for any particular state visit\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have\r\nnot met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against\r\naccepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us\r\nwith offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any\r\nstatements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the\r\nUnited States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods\r\nand addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including\r\nchecks, online payments and credit card donations.

Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with\r\nanyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm\r\neBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions,\r\nall of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright\r\nnotice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance\r\nwith any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook\xe2\x80\x99s eBook\r\nnumber, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed\r\n(zipped), HTML and others.\r\n\r\nCorrected _editions_ of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the\r\nold filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.\r\n_Versions_ based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\r\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n\r\n    http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how\r\nto make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation,\r\nhow to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email\r\nnewsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***FINIS***\r\n'

]\r\n\r\n\r\nBy putting himself into reverse, the doom-intended man left the\r\ntwentieth century far ahead. Nineteen fifty-six was a good year to\r\nget out of. John Arthur Benn watched the roaring twenties go by, and\r\nthe gay nineties, backwards, and wondered how it would be to pilot a\r\nriverboat on the Mississippi, or to fight under John Paul Jones.\r\n\r\nBefore he was really aware of it, he was for a speeding second a\r\ncontemporary of another John--Smith--and thought about the life of the\r\nRedman before the colonists began changing things around. By that time\r\nthe scenery had begun to get monotonous--just shrinking trees--and John\r\nArthur Benn swung over into lateral. 

Ah, England.\r\n\r\nThere went another namesake--Ben Jonson--and in a very little while he\r\nconsidered slowing down to meet still another. But King Arthur flashed\r\npast and into a womb in West Wales just as John was convulsed by a\r\nsneeze (it was quite drafty and he should have dressed more warmly),\r\nand as he stuffed his handkerchief back in his pocket he caught just a\r\ntantalizing glimpse of an interesting Druid ceremony.\r\n\r\nJohn Arthur Benn blacked out somewhere in the limbo of the\r\npre-Christian era, as he'd been warned he might, and when he came to\r\nhe found himself lying in a rather uncomfortable heap with his head\r\nin a mushroom patch. The mushrooms and the trees around him weren't\r\nshrinking any more, so John knew he'd stopped--or at least was going\r\nvery slowly. 

After a while he decided he wasn't going at all, and got\r\nto his feet.\r\n\r\nIt seemed very pleasant here, in the woods, so he found a fallen tree\r\nto sit on and took a wrapped sandwich and a small vacuum bottle of\r\ncoffee out of his pocket. When he'd finished his meal he walked to a\r\nstream nearby, rinsed the bottle, tossed the waxed paper onto the water\r\nto be carried away and pocketed the vacuum bottle.\r\n\r\nNow, he thought, what? This was scarcely dinosaur country. 

At this\r\npoint a wild boar chased him up a tree. To be killed by a boar would\r\nbe ignominious, after all this, although the animal was well enough\r\ntusked to have done the job, and so John Arthur Benn climbed to a high\r\nbranch, where the boar's persistence forced him to spend the night.\r\nHe slept, somehow, and, with the closing of his conscious mind--the\r\none that wanted to meet a dinosaur in fatal combat--the conventional\r\nsubconscious, which also sought suicide, but in a more familiar way,\r\nshifted him out of reverse.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke, he was back in 1956, in Philadelphia. Irrevocably, John\r\nArthur Benn knew.\r\n\r\nHe went home and hanged himself in a closet.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


It could well become a\r\n minor classic._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Last Supper\r\n\r\nBy T. D. Hamm\r\n\r\n\r\nHampered as she was by the child in her arms, the woman was running less\r\nfleetly now. A wave of exultation swept over Guldran, drowning out the\r\nuneasy feeling of guilt at disobeying orders.\r\n\r\nThe instructions were mandatory and concise: "_No_ capture must be\r\nattempted individually. In the event of sighting any form of human life,\r\nthe ship MUST be notified immediately. 

All small craft must be back at\r\nthe landing space not later than one hour before take-off. 

Anyone not so\r\nreporting will be presumed lost."\r\n\r\nGuldran thought uneasily of the great seas of snow and ice sweeping\r\ninexorably toward each other since the Earth had reversed on its axis in\r\nthe great catastrophe a millennium ago. Now, summer and winter alike\r\nbrought paralyzing gales and blizzards, heralded by the sleety snow in\r\nwhich the woman\'s skin-clad feet had left the tracks which led to\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\nHis trained anthropologist\'s mind speculated avidly over the little they\r\nhad gotten from the younger of the two men found nearly a week before,\r\nnearly frozen and half-starved. The older man had succumbed almost at\r\nonce; the other, in the most primitive sign language, had indicated\r\nthat, of several humans living in caves to the west, only he and the\r\nother had survived to flee some mysterious terror. Guldran felt a throb\r\nof pity for the woman and her child, left behind by the men, no doubt,\r\nas a hindrance.\r\n\r\nBut what a stroke of fortune that there should be left a male and female\r\nof the race to carry the seed of Terra to another planet. And what a\r\ntriumph if he, Guldran, should be the one to return at the eleventh hour\r\nwith the prize. No need of calling for help. This was no armed\r\nwar-party, but the most defenseless being in the Universe--a mother\r\nburdened with a child.\r\n\r\nGuldran put on another burst of speed. His previous shouts had served\r\nonly to spur the woman to greater efforts. Surely there was _some_ magic\r\nword that had survived even the centuries of illiteracy. Something\r\nequivalent to the "bread and salt" of all illiterate peoples. Cupping\r\nhis hands to his mouth, he shouted, "Food! 

food!"\r\n\r\nAhead of him the woman turned her head, leaped lightly in mid-stride,\r\nand went on; slowing a little but still running doggedly.\r\n\r\nGuldran\'s pulse leaped. He yelled again, "Food!"\r\n\r\nThe instant that his foot touched the yielding surface of the trap, he\r\nknew that he had met defeat. As his body crashed down on the\r\nfire-sharpened stakes, he knew too the terror from which the last men of\r\nthe human race had fled.\r\n\r\nAbove him the woman looked down, her teeth gleaming wolfishly. She\r\npointed down into the pit; spoke exultantly to the child.\r\n\r\n"Food!" said the last woman on earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _If Worlds of Science Fiction_\r\n    September 1952.

Perhaps the west continent still existed; perhaps, dare he\r\nhope, with civilization. 

The crew of the Semilunis thought him quite\r\nmad. After all, hadn't the east and south continents been completely\r\nannihilated from the great sky fires; and wasn't it said that they had\r\nsuffered but a fraction of what the west continent had endured?\r\n\r\nThe Semilunis anchored at the mouth of a great river. The months of fear\r\nand doubt were at end. 

Here, at last, was the west continent. A small\r\nparty of scouts was sent ashore with many cautions to be alert for\r\nluminescent areas which meant certain death for those who remained too\r\nlong in its vicinity. Armed with bow and arrow, the party made its way\r\nslowly up the great river. Nowhere was to be seen the color green, only\r\ndull browns and greys. And no sign of life, save for an occasional patch\r\nof lichen on a rock.\r\n\r\nAfter several days of rowing, the food and water supply was almost half\r\ndepleted and still no evidence of either past or present habitation. It\r\nwas time to turn back, to travel all the weary months across the West\r\nWater, the journey all in vain. What a small reward for such an arduous\r\ntrip ... just proof of the existence of a barren land mass, ugly and\r\nuseless.\r\n\r\nOn the second day of the return to the Semilunis, the scouting party\r\ndecided to stop and investigate a huge opening in the rocky mountainside.\r\nHow suspiciously regular and even it looked, particularly in comparison\r\nto the rest of the countryside which was jagged and chaotic.\r\n\r\nThey entered the cave apprehensively, torches aflare and weapons in\r\nhand. But all was darkness and quiet. 

Still, the regularity of the cave\r\nwalls led them on. Some creature, man or otherwise, must have planned\r\nand built this ... but to what end? Now the cave divided into three\r\nforks. The torches gave only a hint of the immensity of the chambers\r\nthat lay at the end of each. They selected the center chamber,\r\napproaching cautiously, breath caught in awe and excitement. The torches\r\nreflected on a dull black surface which was divided into many, many\r\nlittle squares. 

The sameness of them stretched for uncountable yards in\r\nall directions. What were these ungodly looking edifices?

Tell me your story again."\r\n\r\nThe man was short and stocky, with Asiatic features and a long, stringy\r\nmustache. "The whole story?" 

he asked. "It would take a lifetime to tell\r\nyou." He stared out the window at the yellow sun and the red sun. 

He\r\nstill hadn\'t gotten used to seeing two suns. But that was minor, really,\r\nwhen there were so many other things he had to get used to.\r\n\r\nA robot waiter, with long thin metal tubes for arms and legs, glided\r\nover. When he\'d first seen one of those, he\'d thought it was a demon.\r\nHe\'d tried to smash it. They\'d had trouble with him at first.\r\n\r\n"They had trouble with me at first," he said.\r\n\r\n"I can imagine," said the girl. "How did they explain it to you?

"\r\n\r\n"It was hard. They had to give me the whole history of medicine. It was\r\nyears before I got over the notion that I was up in the Everlasting Blue\r\nSky, or under the earth, or something." He grinned at the girl. She was\r\nthe first person he\'d met since they got him a job and gave him a home\r\nin a world uncountable light years from the one he\'d been born on.\r\n\r\n"When did you begin to understand?"\r\n\r\n"They simply taught all of history to me. Including the part about\r\nmyself. Then I began to get the picture. 

Funny. I wound up teaching them\r\na lot of history."\r\n\r\n"I bet you know a lot."\r\n\r\n"I do," the man with the Asiatic features said modestly. "Anyway, they\r\nfinally got across to me that in the 22nd century--they had explained\r\nthe calendar to me, too; I used a different one in my day--they had\r\nlearned how to grow new limbs on people who had lost arms and legs."\r\n\r\n"That was the first real step," said the girl.\r\n\r\n"It was a long time till they got to the second step," he said. "They\r\nlearned how to stimulate life and new growth in people who had already\r\ndied."\r\n\r\n"The next part is the thing I don\'t understand," the girl said.\r\n\r\n"Well," said the man, "as I get it, they found that any piece of matter\r\nthat has been part of an organism, retains a physical \'memory\' of the\r\nentire structure of the organism of which it was part. And that they\r\ncould reconstruct that structure from a part of a person, if that was\r\nall there was left of him. From there it was just a matter of pushing\r\nthe process back through time. They had to teach me a whole new language\r\nto explain that one."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it wonderful that intergalactic travel gives us room to expand?"\r\nsaid the girl. "I mean now that every human being that ever lived has\r\nbeen brought back to life and will live forever?"\r\n\r\n"Same problem I had, me and my people," said the man. "We were cramped\r\nfor space. This age has solved it a lot better than I did. 

But they had\r\nto give me a whole psychological overhauling before I understood that."\r\n\r\n"Tell me about your past life," said the girl, staring dreamily at him.\r\n\r\n"Well, six thousand years ago, I was born in the Gobi Desert, on Earth,"\r\nsaid Genghis Khan, sipping his drink.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ December 1957.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            He wanted above anything else to go into space.\r\n               He had been waiting for it--a long time!\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was hours after the last official ceremony before Clifton could\r\nescape the crowd of planetlubbers with their babblings, their eligible\r\ndaughters and their stupid self-admiration. They\'d paid through the\r\nnose to get him here, and they meant to get their money\'s worth.\r\n\r\nThe exit led only to a little balcony, but it seemed to be deserted. He\r\ntook a deep breath of the night air and his eyes moved unconsciously\r\ntoward the stars.\r\n\r\nComing back to Earth had been a mistake, but he\'d needed the\r\nmoney. Space Products Unlimited wanted a real deepspace hero to\r\nhelp celebrate its hundredth anniversary. He had just finished the\r\nRegulation of Rigel, so he\'d been picked. 

Damn them and their silly\r\nspeeches and awards--and damn Earth! What was one planet when there\r\nwere a billion up there among the stars?\r\n\r\nFrom the other side of a potted plant there was a soft sigh.\r\n\r\nClifton swung his head, then relaxed as he saw the other man was not\r\nlooking at him. The eyes behind the dark glasses were directed toward\r\nthe sky.\r\n\r\n"Aldebaran, Sirius, Deneb, Alpha Centauri," the voice whispered. It\r\nwas a high-pitched voice with an odd accent, but there was the poetry\r\nof ancient yearning in it.\r\n\r\nHe was a small, shriveled old man. His shoulders were bent. A long\r\nbeard and the dark glasses covered most of his face, but could not\r\nentirely conceal the deep wrinkles, even in the moonlight.\r\n\r\nClifton felt a sudden touch of pity and moved closer, without quite\r\nknowing why. "Didn\'t I see you on the platform?

"\r\n\r\n"Your memory is very good, Captain. I was awarded publicly--for fifty\r\nyears of faithful service making space boots. Well, I was always a\r\ngood cobbler, and perhaps my boots helped some men out there." The old\r\nman\'s hand swept toward the stars, then fell back to grip the railing\r\ntightly. "They gave me a gold watch, though time means nothing to me.\r\nAnd a cheap world cruise ticket. As if there were any spot on this\r\nworld I could still want to see." 

He laughed harshly. "Forgive me if I\r\nsound bitter. But, you see, I\'ve never been off Earth!"\r\n\r\nClifton stared at him incredulously. "But everyone--"\r\n\r\n"Everyone but me," the old man said. "Oh, I tried. I was utterly weary\r\nof Earth and I looked at the stars and dreamed. But I failed the early\r\nrigid physicals. Then, when things were easier, I tried again. A\r\nplague grounded the first ship. A strike delayed another. Then one\r\nexploded on the pad and only a few on board were saved. It was then I\r\nrealized I was meant to wait here--here on Earth, and nowhere else. So\r\nI stayed, making space boots."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPity and impulse forced unexpected words to Clifton\'s lips. "I\'m taking\r\noff for Rigel again in four hours, and there\'s a spare cabin on the\r\n_Maryloo_. You\'re coming with me."\r\n\r\nThe old hand that gripped his arm was oddly gentle. "Bless you,\r\nCaptain. 

But it would never work. I\'m under orders to remain here."\r\n\r\n"Nobody can order a man grounded forever. You\'re coming with me if I\r\nhave to drag you, Mr.--"\r\n\r\n"Ahasuerus."\r\n\r\nThe old man hesitated, as if expecting the name to mean something. Then\r\nhe sighed and lifted his dark glasses.\r\n\r\nClifton met the other\'s gaze for less than a second. 

Then his own eyes\r\ndropped, though memory of what he had seen was already fading. He\r\nvaulted over the balcony railing and began running away from Ahasuerus,\r\ntoward his ship and the unconfined reaches of space.\r\n\r\nBehind him, the eternal wanderer tarried and waited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n

Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are\r\nparticularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.\r\nCompliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable\r\neffort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these\r\nrequirements. 

We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not\r\nreceived written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or\r\ndetermine the status of compliance for any particular state visit\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have\r\nnot met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against\r\naccepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us\r\nwith offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any\r\nstatements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the\r\nUnited States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods\r\nand addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including\r\nchecks, online payments and credit card donations.

Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with\r\nanyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm\r\neBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions,\r\nall of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright\r\nnotice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance\r\nwith any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook\xe2\x80\x99s eBook\r\nnumber, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed\r\n(zipped), HTML and others.\r\n\r\nCorrected _editions_ of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the\r\nold filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.\r\n_Versions_ based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\r\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n\r\n    http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how\r\nto make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation,\r\nhow to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email\r\nnewsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***FINIS***\r\n'

Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are\r\nparticularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.\r\nCompliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable\r\neffort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these\r\nrequirements.

Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with\r\nanyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm\r\neBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions,\r\nall of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright\r\nnotice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance\r\nwith any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook\xe2\x80\x99s eBook\r\nnumber, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed\r\n(zipped), HTML and others.\r\n\r\nCorrected _editions_ of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the\r\nold filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.\r\n_Versions_ based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\r\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n\r\n    http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how\r\nto make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation,\r\nhow to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email\r\nnewsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***FINIS***\r\n'




]\r\n\r\n\r\nMaybe a guy shouldn\'t believe everything he hears, but the trouble with\r\nsome people is that they don\'t even believe a true story. Let me buy\r\nyou a beer and tell you about it.\r\n\r\nAfter working some years in the baggage room of the local depot, I\r\ndecided to transfer to the train service, and made application for it.\r\nThe application was approved. I was sent to the city offices for the\r\ncourse of study and training which all trainmen undergo, and after\r\na time I was sent out as brakeman on a freight. I stayed for a year\r\nand a half. Then I succeeded in being assigned as head brakeman on a\r\nfast food special called The Red Ball Special. It made no stop between\r\nChicago and New York except for water and fuel. The big Diesel in which\r\nI rode as head brakie was a high-speed locomotive, used exclusively for\r\nhauling the food special.\r\n\r\nOur first stop was Detroit, where we cut off all but three cars, and\r\ntook on five more scheduled in New York at 9 the next morning. In New\r\nYork, I strolled along Broadway, gawking at the sights exactly like any\r\nother yokel.\r\n\r\nAfter a twelve-hour rest, the return trip began. I stood in my place in\r\nthe big Diesel till we had cleared for the main line, and then settled\r\nback to enjoy the ride.\r\n\r\nIt was close to midnight. 

I sat at the cab window half asleep, my\r\nsenses somewhat dulled by the steady rhythm of train movement. I\'d\r\nfinished an extra good cigar and had started to doze off when the\r\nengineer gave a low moan and toppled from his seat to the floor of the\r\ncab.\r\n\r\nThe fireman, much against the rules, but feeling safe with the engineer\r\nand myself to watch in his place, had gone back to inspect a suspected\r\nleaking air hose without waiting for the train to stop.\r\n\r\nI got the engineer back on his seat. He was dead.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI tied him in place and then began pulling on the whistle cord like\r\nmad. It was not my work to operate a Diesel. 

I\'d not troubled to learn.\r\n\r\nI wondered why the fireman did not get back. I was going to jump,\r\nalthough I didn\'t like my chances at that speed, when I suddenly\r\ndiscovered a strange man in the cab with me. He was a pretty ordinary\r\nlittle guy, except for a wild, shaggy head of hair.\r\n\r\n"You chump!" he squeaked at me. "Maybe next time you\'ll obey the rules,\r\nand not sneak by without finding out things! See that short rod with\r\nthe spring-clip? Squeeze that clip and pull the rod back. 

Move, you\r\nfathead!"\r\n\r\nI did as the shaggy man told me, and felt the speed of the train\r\nslacken slightly as the power went off.\r\n\r\n"Now, that brass handle sticking out of that pipe--move it to the right\r\nslowly. _Slowly_, you dunce!"\r\n\r\nNine cars and the Diesel ground slowly to a stop. The wheels shuddered\r\nand skidded slightly because of my inexperienced hand, but the train\r\ndid stop.\r\n\r\nThe stranger nodded in satisfaction. "When you get back home, bone up\r\non things. But right now you go take a close look at the manifest card\r\non the sides of the second and third cars...."\r\n\r\nI jumped to the ground to go back and look at the second and third\r\ncars. As I passed the rear of the Diesel I saw why the fireman had not\r\ncome back to the engine cab. All that was left of him was the lower\r\npart of his body. He had slipped, caught one foot and gone under the\r\nwheels.\r\n\r\nI came to the second car and read the manifest label. My hair stood\r\nstraight up.\r\n\r\nThe cars were marked:\r\n\r\n                                Danger\r\n                               DYNAMITE\r\n                           _High Explosive_\r\n\r\nThe shaggy man was at my side. "You\'ve got questions. 

But let me ask\r\nyou one: Ever hear a story about how if you travel back to the time of\r\nan ancestor and you let him die you never get born?

"\r\n\r\n"What about it?" I said.\r\n\r\n"It\'s true," said the shaggy man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n

Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are\r\nparticularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.\r\nCompliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable\r\neffort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these\r\nrequirements.

Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with\r\nanyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm\r\neBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions,\r\nall of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright\r\nnotice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance\r\nwith any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook\'s eBook\r\nnumber, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed\r\n(zipped), HTML and others.\r\n\r\nCorrected _editions_ of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the\r\nold filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.\r\n_Versions_ based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\r\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n\r\n    http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how\r\nto make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation,\r\nhow to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email\r\nnewsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***FINIS***\r\n'




He only laughed back at me and turned his back,\r\nwaving a hand for the bartender. Maybe in a big city in the North it\r\nwould be different and probably it would not: this toleration we hear\r\nabout is no more good than an open fight, and there must be\r\nunderstanding instead. But here near the border, just on the American\r\nside of the border, a Mexican is called fair game, and a\r\nseventeen-year-old like me is less than nothing to them, to the white\r\nones who go to the big bars.\r\n\r\nI thought carefully about what to do, and finally when I had made my\r\nmind up I went for him and tried to hit him. But other men held me back,\r\nand I was kicking and shouting with my legs off the ground. 

When I\r\nstopped they put me down, so I started for the big red-haired man again\r\nand they had to stop me again. 

The red-haired man was laughing all this\r\ntime. I wanted to run, back to my own family in their little house, and\r\nyet running would have been wrong; I was too angry to run, so I stayed.\r\n\r\n"My sister," I said. "My sister is a witch and I will get her to put a\r\ncurse on you." I was very angry, you must understand this.\r\n\r\nAnd of course they had no idea that my sister is a real witch, and her\r\ncurses are real, and only last year Manuel Valdez had died from the\r\neffects of her curse. Of all people, sometimes I wish I were my sister\r\nmost of all, to curse people and see them shrivel and sicken and choke\r\nand die.\r\n\r\n"Go ahead, half-pint," one of the other men yelled. "Get your sister to\r\nput a curse on me. I bet she knows who I am; I been with every Mex girl\r\nthis side of the border."\r\n\r\nThis made me see red; my sister is pure and must be pure, since she is a\r\nwitch. And she is not like some of the others even aside from that. 

I\r\nhave heard her talk about them and I know.\r\n\r\nI called him a name and ran up to him and hit him; my fist against his\r\nsolid side felt good, but some other men pulled me off again. Yet it was\r\nimpossible to leave. This was wrong for me, and I had to make it right.\r\n"I shall get my father to fight you, since he is a giant ten feet tall."\r\n\r\nThe men laughed at me, not knowing, of course, that my father is a giant\r\nten feet tall in truth, and my mother a sweet siren like those in the\r\nbooks, the old books, with spells in her eyes and a strange power. They\r\ndid not know I was not a daydreaming child but a man who told truth.\r\n\r\nAnd they laughed; I grew angry again and told them many things, calling\r\nthem names in Spanish, which they did not understand. That only made\r\nthem laugh the more.\r\n\r\nFinally I left; it was necessary for me to leave, since I was not\r\nwanted. But it was necessary, too, for me to make things right. 

Nights\r\nlater they were dead for what they had said and done.\r\n\r\nFor I tell the truth always, and I had told them about my sister and my\r\nfather and my mother. But one thing I had not told them.\r\n\r\nI am sorry they could never know I was the winged thing that frightened\r\nand killed them, one by one....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ January 1957.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

And the Enforced\r\nBirth Control Program couldn\'t be enforced. Overpopulation still remains\r\nthe thorn in our side. Gentlemen--" He paused to look each of the\r\nassembled reporters in the eye. "--there is but _one_ answer."\r\n\r\n"Mass annihilation?" quavered a cub reporter.\r\n\r\n"Posh, boy! Certainly not!" 

The professor bristled. "The answer\r\nis--TIME!"\r\n\r\n"Time?"\r\n\r\n"Exactly," nodded Ohms. With a dramatic flourish he swept aside a red\r\nvelvet drape--to reveal a tall structure of gleaming metal. "As\r\nwitness!

"\r\n\r\n"Golly, what\'s _that_ thing?" queried the cub.\r\n\r\n"This _thing_," replied the professor acidly, "--is the C. Cydwick Ohms\r\nTime Door."\r\n\r\n"Whillikers, a Time Machine!

"\r\n\r\n"Not so, not so. _Please_, boy! A Time Machine, in the popular sense,\r\nis impossible. Wild fancy! However--" The professor tapped the dottle\r\nfrom his pipe. "--by a mathematically precise series of infinite\r\ncalculations, I have developed the remarkable C. Cydwick Ohms Time Door.\r\nOpen it, take but a single step--and, presto! The Past!

"\r\n\r\n"But, _where_ in the past, Prof.?"\r\n\r\nOhms smiled easily down at the tense ring of faces. "Gentlemen, beyond\r\nthis door lies the sprawling giant of the Southwest--enough land to\r\nabsorb Earth\'s overflow like _that_!" He snapped his fingers. "I speak,\r\ngentlemen, of Texas, 1957!"\r\n\r\n"What if the Texans _object_?"\r\n\r\n"They have no choice. The Time Door is strictly a one-way passage. 

I saw\r\nto that. It will be utterly impossible for anyone in 1957 to re-enter\r\nour world of 2057. And now--the Past awaits!

"\r\n\r\nHe tossed aside his professorial robes. Under them Cydwick Ohms wore an\r\nancient and bizarre costume: black riding boots, highly polished and\r\ntrimmed in silver; wool chaps; a wide, jewel-studded belt with an\r\nimmense buckle; a brightly checked shirt topped by a blazing red\r\nbandana. Briskly, he snapped a tall ten-gallon hat on his head, and\r\nstepped to the Time Door.\r\n\r\nGripping an ebony handle, he tugged upward. The huge metal door oiled\r\nslowly back. "Time," said Cydwick Ohms simply, gesturing toward the gray\r\nnothingness beyond the door.\r\n\r\nThe reporters and photographers surged forward, notebooks and cameras at\r\nthe ready. "What if the door swings shut after you\'re gone?" one of them\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n"A groundless fear, boy," assured Ohms. "I have seen to it that the Time\r\nDoor can never be closed. And now--good-bye, gentlemen. Or, to use the\r\nproper colloquialism--_so long, hombres!_"\r\n\r\nOhms bowed from the waist, gave his ten-gallon hat a final tug, and took\r\na single step forward.\r\n\r\nAnd did _not_ disappear.\r\n\r\nHe stood, blinking. Then he swore, beat upon the unyielding wall of\r\ngrayness with clenched fists, and fell back, panting, to his desk.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve failed!" 

he moaned in a lost voice. "The C. Cydwick Ohms Time Door\r\nis a botch!" He buried his head in trembling hands.\r\n\r\nThe reporters and photographers began to file out.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the professor raised his head. "_Listen!_" he warned.\r\n\r\nA slow rumbling, muted with distance, emanated from the dense grayness\r\nof the Time Door. Faint yips and whoopings were distinct above the\r\nrumble. The sounds grew steadily--to a thousand beating drums--to a\r\nrolling sea of thunder!\r\n\r\nShrieking, the reporters and photographers scattered for the stairs.\r\n\r\nAh, another knotty problem to be solved, mused Professor Cydwick Ohms,\r\nswinging, with some difficulty, onto one of three thousand Texas steers\r\nstampeding into the laboratory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ November 1956.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

The roll call of celebrities\r\nread like the Who\'s Who of S.F. Prodom: Theodore Sturgeon, Isaac Asimov,\r\nFritz Leiber, Willy Ley, Nelson Bond, John W. Campbell Jr., L. Sprague\r\nde Camp, James Blish, Judith Merril, "Ted" Carnell (Editor of New\r\nWorlds), Kelly Freas, Edmond Hamilton, Leigh Brackett, Anthony Boucher,\r\nWilliam Tenn, James E. Gunn, Frank Belknap Long Jr., and numerous\r\nothers, including Guest of Honor Arthur C. Clarke.\r\n\r\nA standing ovation was given Arthur Clarke before and after his speech\r\nat the Banquet, a serious address that lasted forty-five minutes and\r\ncovered many philosophical facets of the s.f. field. Especially rousing\r\nhands were given two of the real old-timers present, artist Frank R.\r\nPaul (Guest of Honor of the first Convention), and--out of the Ark--the\r\nman who once was an assistant to Thomas Alva Edison, the pioneer\r\nnovelist of scientific romances and the man who discovered the Golden\r\nAtom--Ray Cummings. World famous cartoonist Al Capp gave a hilarious\r\nspeech at the Banquet Sunday night, other large laughs being garnered on\r\nthe occasion by Isaac Asimov and Anthony Boucher, Robert Bloch again\r\nproving that he has no peer as a Master of Ceremonies.\r\n\r\nThe Masquerade Ball was filmed for televising, and was a sight for\r\nbugging eyes. Extraterrestrial glamour girls came in spectrumatic\r\ncolors: one, Ruth Landis of Venus (formerly Nuyok), was a verdant\r\nbeauty, fresh as a breath of chlorophyll; while tall Tam Otteson, a\r\nrecent import from England, had the judges agreeing that just looking at\r\nher was an education. 

Olga Ley won for the Most Beautiful costume, and\r\nJos Christoff--a survivor from the first convention of them all--was\r\nanother prize winner. Monsters, mutants, scientists, spacemen, aliens,\r\nand assorted "Things" thronged the ballroom floor as the flashbulbs\r\npopped.\r\n\r\nJohn Campbell lectured on and demonstrated his controversial psionic\r\nHieronymus machine, and famous fans sprang from der vood-work out--Sam\r\nMoskowitz, James Taurasi, Bob Tucker, Julius Unger, Raymond Van Houten,\r\nAllen Glasser ...\r\n\r\nDavid Kyle, E. E. Evans, James Taurasi, myself and 2 others were elected\r\nDirectors of the World Science Fiction Society.\r\n\r\nNo account of the Newyorcon could be complete without a deep bow of\r\nappreciation to the altruistic trio of committeemen (including one\r\ncomely woman) who all but destroyed themselves engineering the\r\nConvention: David A. Kyle, Ruth Landis and Dick Ellington.\r\n\r\nBy a vote of 3 to 1, London was selected as the site of the 15th Con, to\r\nbe held in \'57. For an unforgettable experience in the fantastic\r\nuniverse of science fiction enthusiasts, plan _now_ to attend the\r\nLONCON!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ January 1957.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are\r\nparticularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.\r\nCompliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable\r\neffort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these\r\nrequirements. 

We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not\r\nreceived written confirmation of compliance.

Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with\r\nanyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm\r\neBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions,\r\nall of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright\r\nnotice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance\r\nwith any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook\xe2\x80\x99s eBook\r\nnumber, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed\r\n(zipped), HTML and others.\r\n\r\nCorrected _editions_ of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the\r\nold filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.\r\n_Versions_ based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\r\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n\r\n    http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how\r\nto make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation,\r\nhow to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email\r\nnewsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***FINIS***\r\n'




It\r\nwill operate only on objects weighing less than three pounds, five\r\nounces and for distances into the past and future of twelve minutes or\r\nless. But it works."\r\n\r\nThe small-scale model looked like a small scale--a postage scale--except\r\nfor two dials in the part under the platform.\r\n\r\nProfessor Johnson held up a small metal cube. "Our experimental object,"\r\nhe said, "is a brass cube weighing one pound, two point three ounces.\r\nFirst, I shall send it five minutes into the future."\r\n\r\nHe leaned forward and set one of the dials on the time machine. "Look at\r\nyour watches," he said.\r\n\r\nThey looked at their watches. Professor Johnson placed the cube gently\r\non the machine\'s platform. It vanished.\r\n\r\nFive minutes later, to the second, it reappeared.\r\n\r\nProfessor Johnson picked it up. "Now five minutes into the past." 

He set\r\nthe other dial. Holding the cube in his hand he looked at his watch. "It\r\nis six minutes before three o\'clock. I shall now activate the\r\nmechanism--by placing the cube on the platform--at exactly three\r\no\'clock. Therefore, the cube should, at five minutes before three,\r\nvanish from my hand and appear on the platform, five minutes before I\r\nplace it there."\r\n\r\n"How can you place it there, then?" asked one of his colleagues.\r\n\r\n"It will, as my hand approaches, vanish from the platform and appear in\r\nmy hand to be placed there. Three o\'clock. 

Notice, please."\r\n\r\nThe cube vanished from his hand.\r\n\r\nIt appeared on the platform of the time machine.\r\n\r\n"See? Five minutes before I shall place it there, it _is_ there!"\r\n\r\nHis other colleague frowned at the cube. "But," he said, "what if, now\r\nthat it has already appeared five minutes before you place it there, you\r\nshould change your mind about doing so and _not_ place it there at three\r\no\'clock? Wouldn\'t there be a paradox of some sort involved?

"\r\n\r\n"An interesting idea," Professor Johnson said. "I had not thought of it,\r\nand it will be interesting to try. 

Very well, I shall _not_ ..."\r\n\r\nThere was no paradox at all. The cube remained.\r\n\r\nBut the entire rest of the Universe, professors and all, vanished.\r\n\r\n\r\nSentry\r\n\r\nHe was wet and muddy and hungry and cold, and he was fifty thousand\r\nlight-years from home.\r\n\r\nA strange blue sun gave light and the gravity, twice what he was used\r\nto, made every movement difficult.\r\n\r\nBut in tens of thousands of years this part of war hadn\'t changed. The\r\nflyboys were fine with their sleek spaceships and their fancy weapons.\r\nWhen the chips are down, though, it was still the foot soldier, the\r\ninfantry, that had to take the ground and hold it, foot by bloody foot.\r\nLike this damned planet of a star he\'d never heard of until they\'d\r\nlanded him there. And now it was sacred ground because the aliens were\r\nthere too. _The_ aliens, the only other intelligent race in the\r\nGalaxy ... cruel, hideous and repulsive monsters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nContact had been made with them near the center of the Galaxy, after the\r\nslow, difficult colonization of a dozen thousand planets; and it had\r\nbeen war at sight; they\'d shot without even trying to negotiate, or to\r\nmake peace.\r\n\r\nNow, planet by bitter planet, it was being fought out.\r\n\r\nHe was wet and muddy and hungry and cold, and the day was raw with a\r\nhigh wind that hurt his eyes. But the aliens were trying to infiltrate\r\nand every sentry post was vital.\r\n\r\nHe stayed alert, gun ready. Fifty thousand light-years from home,\r\nfighting on a strange world and wondering if he\'d ever live to see home\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nAnd then he saw one of them crawling toward him. He drew a bead and\r\nfired. The alien made that strange horrible sound they all make, then\r\nlay still.\r\n\r\nHe shuddered at the sound and sight of the alien lying there. 

One ought\r\nto be able to get used to them after a while, but he\'d never been able\r\nto. Such repulsive creatures they were, with only two arms and two legs,\r\nghastly white skins and no scales.\r\n\r\n                                                       --FREDRIC BROWN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Galaxy Science Fiction_ February 1954.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

One of Da\'s\r\ncustomers had shopped him.  The ipolice paid in high-grade\r\npharmaceuticals -- performance enhancers, memory supplements, metabolic\r\nboosters.  The kind of things that cost a fortune over the counter; the\r\nkind of things you could print at home, if you didn\'t mind the risk of\r\nhaving your kitchen filled with a sudden crush of big, beefy bodies,\r\nhard truncheons whistling through the air, smashing anyone and anything\r\nthat got in the way.\r\n\r\nThey destroyed grandma\'s trunk, the one she\'d brought from the old\r\ncountry.  They smashed our little refrigerator and the purifier unit\r\nover the window.  My tweetybird escaped death by hiding in a corner of\r\nhis cage as a big, booted foot crushed most of it into a sad tangle of\r\nprinter-wire.\r\n\r\nDa.  What they did to him.  

When he was done, he looked like he\'d been\r\nbrawling with an entire rugby side.  They brought him out the door and\r\nlet the newsies get a good look at him as they tossed him in the car.\r\nAll the while a spokesman told the world that my Da\'s organized-crime\r\nbootlegging operation had been responsible for at least 20 million in\r\ncontraband, and that my Da, the desperate villain, had resisted arrest.\r\n\r\nI saw it all from my phone, in the remains of the sitting room, watching\r\nit on the screen and wondering how, just how anyone could look at our\r\nlittle flat and our terrible, manky estate and mistake it for the home\r\nof an organized crime kingpin.  They took the printer away, of course,\r\nand displayed it like a trophy for the newsies.  

Its little shrine in\r\nthe kitchenette seemed horribly empty.  When I roused myself and picked\r\nup the flat and rescued my poor peeping tweetybird, I put a blender\r\nthere.  It was made out of printed parts, so it would only last a month\r\nbefore I\'d need to print new bearings and other moving parts.  Back\r\nthen, I could take apart and reassemble anything that could be printed.\r\n\r\nBy the time I turned 18, they were ready to let Da out of prison.  I\'d\r\nvisited him three times -- on my tenth birthday, on his fiftieth, and\r\nwhen Ma died.  It had been two years since I\'d last seen him and he was\r\nin bad shape.  A prison fight had left him with a limp, and he looked\r\nover his shoulder so often it was like he had a tic.  I was embarrassed\r\nwhen the minicab dropped us off in front of the estate, and tried to\r\nkeep my distance from this ruined, limping skeleton as we went inside\r\nand up the stairs.\r\n\r\n"Lanie," he said, as he sat me down.  "You\'re a smart girl, I know that.\r\nYou wouldn\'t know where your old Da could get a printer and some goop?"\r\n\r\nI squeezed my hands into fists so tight my fingernails cut into my\r\npalms.  I closed my eyes.  "You\'ve been in prison for ten years, Da.\r\nTen.  Years.  You\'re going to risk another ten years to print out more\r\nblenders and pharma, more laptops and designer hats?"\r\n\r\nHe grinned.  "I\'m not stupid, Lanie.  I\'ve learned my lesson.  There\'s\r\nno hat or laptop that\'s worth going to jail for.  I\'m not going to print\r\nnone of that rubbish, never again." He had a cup of tea, and he drank it\r\nnow like it was whisky, a sip and then a long, satisfied exhalation.  He\r\nclosed his eyes and leaned back in his chair.\r\n\r\n"Come here, Lanie, let me whisper in your ear.  Let me tell you the\r\nthing that I decided while I spent ten years in lockup.  Come here and\r\nlisten to your stupid Da."\r\n\r\nI felt a guilty pang about ticking him off.  He was off his rocker, that\r\nmuch was clear.  God knew what he went through in prison.  

"What, Da?" I\r\nsaid, leaning in close.\r\n\r\n"Lanie, I\'m going to print more printers.  Lots more printers.  

One for\r\neveryone.  That\'s worth going to jail for.  

That\'s worth anything."\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nCory Doctorow has spent the past four years at the Electronic Frontier\r\nFoundation (www.eff.org), fighting at the United Nations and in\r\ntech-standards bodies to balance the rights of copyright and patent\r\nholders with the public interest.

copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n"Oluf!"\r\n\r\n"Bowron!"\r\n\r\nThey recognized each other simultaneously, there in the thin fringe of\r\ntangled brush skirting a hidden lake.\r\n\r\n"Oluf, it\'s good to see you again--I thought there was nothing but\r\nmountains, wolves and Wild Ones between me and civilization!" They\r\npicked their way slowly toward the shore together.\r\n\r\nOluf dropped gratefully to the warm sand. The sunset highlighted his\r\nreddish hair. "You\'re not far wrong--there was wolf spoor back on that\r\nnorth ridge. But what in the name of the Moon are you doing so far from\r\nNew York?"\r\n\r\n"Heading south, to stay," Bowron said. He scanned the brush and trees\r\nbehind them cautiously, then stretched out beside his companion,\r\nsighing. "I\'m getting too old for the winters, and the canned foods in\r\nthe ruins are getting scarcer every year."\r\n\r\nOluf looked at him in disbelief. "You\'re traveling alone?"\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t you?" The retort was sharp, with the keen edge of elderly pride.\r\n\r\nSomething like a weary chuckle sounded deep in Oluf\'s throat. He spoke\r\nwith easy candor. "Yes, but--look, Bowron, I\'m a hunter by choice. And\r\nI\'m big and in my prime. 

I can run half a day at top speed, and I\'m not\r\ntoo bad in a free-for-all. You\'re a teacher--wise, but not in the ways\r\nof the wilds; your senses are dull and your reactions slow, like all\r\ncity folk."\r\n\r\nBowron\'s eyes looked suddenly tired, older. He gazed out over the\r\nplacid water. 

"I could persuade no one to accompany me," he said\r\nsimply. "You made a good choice, Oluf, to terminate your education and\r\nseek the freedom of the wilds--the natural life that I think all must\r\nsomeday embrace." He sighed deeply. 

"Of course, there is the dream of\r\nachievement that the city dwellers entertain. We\'ve grown soft in\r\nour dependence upon the buried food in the rubble--spending our time\r\nin study of the books and other god-things, always hoping that we can\r\nunderstand and duplicate the old civilization. But our best thinkers,\r\nsince they are the most eager searchers, stumble most often into the\r\nhidden pockets of radioactivity that endure even yet; and they die, and\r\ntheir knowledge dies with them, and our dreams and aspirations become\r\ndimmer with each generation."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOluf grunted, and Bowron went on as though to himself. "I\'ve come\r\nto believe that it\'s useless to follow in the footsteps of the\r\ngods--that we must wait, and think, and work, each in his own way,\r\nuntil we learn what is possible for us through our own trials and\r\nthe further development of our simple tools. We\'ve learned much from\r\nthe god-things, slowly, over the years. But we also know that we\'re\r\nmutants, changed by the radiation of the great war areas, breeding true\r\nat last, and that we are different from the Wild Ones. True, we\'re\r\nsuperior, but--we\'re not gods. Whether we can ever--"\r\n\r\nOluf had sprung to his feet and was gone with incredible speed. 

Bowron\r\nsat up tensely, listened to the crashing of brush, and, finally, to\r\na shrill squeal of departing life. He relaxed and waited until Oluf,\r\ngrinning, returned with a rabbit.\r\n\r\n"Our dinner, old-timer. Sorry I wasn\'t listening too closely to what\r\nyou were saying."\r\n\r\nLater, after they had eaten and were stretched comfortably on the\r\nmoon-drenched shore, Oluf grew reminiscent. "I remember your teachings,\r\nBowron. And I recall well our endless attempts to operate the\r\ngod-things--the machines and mechanisms. 

But all that always seemed\r\nstrange. Best of all I liked the tales of the old days--the stories of\r\nour ancestors."\r\n\r\nBowron nodded thoughtfully. "It was that way with most of my pupils. It\r\nwas more comfortable to dream of the past than to cope with the current\r\nhardships. It seemed to arouse some dormant instinct in all of us--" He\r\nbroke off and sighed. "Would you like to hear another of the stories?

"\r\n\r\n"Very much!"\r\n\r\nBowron studied the bright moon. "Well--once in the far and long ago,\r\nthere was a man named Smith, who lived in a big city...."\r\n\r\nWhen the tale was done, Oluf seemed deeply moved. "I believe," he said\r\nslowly, "that I\'ll go with you to the Southland. You might easily\r\nperish on the way, and such words as yours must live to give others\r\ncomfort and hope--for we may yet find living gods in some remote corner\r\nof the world. It must have been wonderful," he mused sleepily, "to\r\nhave lived in companionship with the gods--with men." He curled up\r\ncomfortably, paws tucked in, and laid his nose across his bushy tail.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n

When I came\r\nout of the transmitter after commuting to work one day, 2 extra copies\r\nof my original body rather than only the usual one were reassembled at\r\nthe receiving end. In other words I became triplets with each person\r\nhaving the same memories and all. Nobody was around so I decided not\r\nto report it to the transplat company. Until now I was an ordinary guy\r\nwho faithfully hands over his paycheck to the old girl every payday.\r\nDon\'t get me wrong, now. I\'m a happily married man but I do like having\r\na little spending money for myself and a night out with the boys every\r\nnow and then. So the three of us made a deal. 

While one of us went to\r\nwork, another one would be home and the third out on the town. We took\r\nturns, share and share alike. 

Then our wife caught two of us together\r\nand guessed the rest. She is suing for divorce and charging bigamy. We\r\nstill love her though. 

How can we get her to listen to reason? Since\r\nthe case is in the newspapers anyway, I might as well sign my name.\r\nMarried for better or worse.\r\n\r\n                                                            Jimmy Jones\r\n                                                            Jimmy Jones\r\n                                                            Jimmy Jones\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dear Joneses_:\r\n\r\n_Either reintegrate, or draw straws and two of you skidoo._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDear Nan Glanders:\r\n\r\nI am a debutante on tour through the United Planets.

]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt dusk the sergeant leaned over the parapet, weary, looking south\r\ntoward the enemy lines. For him this was the worst part of the day. The\r\nfighting was done until tomorrow and the enemy casualties were being\r\nbrought in through the gate below. Their bodies were piled in awful\r\nabandon on the big flat-bed trucks.\r\n\r\nA phrase from another war came to his mind. Walking wounded. There were\r\nno walking wounded in this war. They came in on the trucks, still and\r\ntangled, or they didn\'t come in at all.\r\n\r\nHe couldn\'t have merely wounded one of the enemy, as soldiers used\r\nto. The thought of inflicting such an injury, in the old conventional\r\nway, was obscene. To strike through the breast into the heart....\r\nHe shuddered with a trembling that came up through the thighs and\r\ncontracted his stomach.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant had come to stand beside him.\r\n\r\n"You shouldn\'t watch, if it bothers you," the lieutenant said.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all right, sir," the sergeant said. He looked down again.\r\n\r\n"We had a good day. Three hundred, the colonel said."\r\n\r\n"That\'s good." The sergeant laughed sardonically. "Are we winning?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s hard to say. We\'re not losing."\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t we, sir?" The sergeant spoke bitterly. "Aren\'t they? Aren\'t we\r\nall?"\r\n\r\n"Look, sergeant--" the lieutenant began. Then he shrugged. The sergeant\r\nwas older than he was by seven or eight years. There was no need to\r\ngive him an orientation lecture. He reached in his pocket and took out\r\na fresh pack of cigarettes. He opened it. 

"Have one. A shipment just\r\ngot in."\r\n\r\n"Thanks." The sergeant took a cigarette. He stared at it and the\r\nfingers holding it trembled. 

"Look at it," he said hollowly. "Look at\r\nthe freakin\' thing!"\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant looked at it, then at the front of the pack. _Ruby tips\r\nto match your lips_, it said under the brand name.\r\n\r\n"What are they doing to us?" the sergeant said. He crumpled the\r\ncigarette in his fist and threw it down and ground it under his boot.\r\n"Isn\'t it hard enough?"\r\n\r\n"It must be a mistake," the lieutenant said. He sounded shaken, too.\r\n"Because of the shortage, maybe. Unless it\'s a fifth column trick. Like\r\nthe rumor about them not going to wake up again."\r\n\r\n"It is just a rumor, isn\'t it?" the sergeant said. 

His voice was almost\r\npleading. "We just freeze them for--for the duration, don\'t we? Don\'t\r\nwe, lieutenant? Because I couldn\'t go on if they were really dead.\r\nNobody could."\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant spoke sharply. "Snap out of it, sergeant! It\'s just\r\npropaganda. I\'m surprised at an old hand like you falling for it.

"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not, sir. We couldn\'t really kill them, could we? It\'d be suicide,\r\nwouldn\'t it? It\'s not total war, is it?"\r\n\r\n"Not total, no. There\'ll be an end to it one day, and then a beginning\r\nagain. I know it\'s hard, but it\'s the only way."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe last of the big trucks had rumbled in from the battlefield. The\r\nsergeant watched the gate close in the fading light. Beloved enemy, he\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n"Three hundred today," he said aloud. "And one was my personal\r\ncontribution. My platoon was strung out behind me, and she came up over\r\nthe hill--"\r\n\r\n"Sergeant!"\r\n\r\n"She was mine. I got her personally. I aimed slow and held the sight on\r\nher. Then I let go. It was almost like--"\r\n\r\n"Sergeant!" The lieutenant was trembling. "The third person singular is\r\nprohibited! You know that, sergeant!"\r\n\r\nThe sergeant was calm. "Yes, sir." He looked at the young officer. "But\r\nI feel better for having told about it. I\'m all right now, sir. I hope\r\nI didn\'t upset you."\r\n\r\n"No," the lieutenant said. "No. 

We\'ll forget about it."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll have one of those cigarettes now, sir, if you don\'t mind. It\r\ndoesn\'t matter about the tip, now that it\'s dark."\r\n\r\n"Well...." The lieutenant hesitated. "I was going to send them back to\r\nQuartermaster, with a report. But all right. 

Here. 

I\'ll have one, too."\r\n\r\nAs the sergeant lit them he could see a bit of the red tip in the\r\nlieutenant\'s mouth. He dragged deep on his own, pretending he could\r\ntaste lipstick.\r\n\r\n"Lieutenant," he said. "It doesn\'t matter where you hit them, does it?\r\nI mean it doesn\'t hurt them at all?"\r\n\r\n"No," the lieutenant said. "No, it doesn\'t matter. They just go to\r\nsleep.

"\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad." After a while the sergeant said, "I guess I\'ll hit the\r\nsack."\r\n\r\n"It\'s still early."\r\n\r\n"Yes. But I like to get up early. There\'s always a line in the\r\nlatrine--at the shaving bowls."\r\n\r\n"Combat troops don\'t have to shave," the lieutenant said.\r\n\r\n"I know. But we do. 

We all do."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


But they were pretty slow\r\ncoming in this time."\r\n\r\nThe doctor looked up quizzically, "Is that the only reason you think you\r\nmight need a booster shot?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no ... of course not!" 

The man leaned forward and placed one hand,\r\npalm up, on the desk. "Last year I had an accident ... stupid ... lost a\r\nthumb." He shrugged apologetically, "It took almost six months to grow\r\nback."\r\n\r\nThoughtfully, the doctor leaned back in his chair, "Hm-m-m ... I see."\r\nAs the man before him made an involuntary movement toward his pocket,\r\nthe doctor smiled, "Go on, smoke if you want to." Picking up the chart,\r\nhe murmured, "Six months ... much too long. Strange we didn\'t catch that\r\nat the time." 

He read silently for a few moments, then began to fill out\r\na form clipped to the folder. "Well, I think you probably are due for\r\nanother booster about now. There\'ll have to be the usual tests. 

Not that\r\nthere\'s much doubt ... we like to be certain."\r\n\r\nThe middle-aged man seemed relieved. Then, on second thought, he\r\nhesitated uneasily, "Why? Is there any danger?"\r\n\r\nAmusement flickered across the doctor\'s face, turned smoothly into a\r\nreassuring half-smile. "Oh, no. 

There\'s absolutely no danger involved.\r\nNone at all. We have tissue-regeneration pretty well under control now.\r\nStill, I\'m sure you understand that accurate records and data are very\r\nnecessary to further research and progress."\r\n\r\nReassured, the patient thawed and became confidential, "I see. Well, I\r\nsuppose it\'s kinda silly, but I don\'t much like shots. It\'s not that\r\nthey hurt ... it\'s just that I guess I\'m old-fashioned. I still feel\r\nkinda \'creepy\' about the whole business." Slightly embarrassed, he\r\npaused and asked defensively, "Is that unusual?"\r\n\r\nThe doctor smiled openly now, "Not at all, not at all. Things have moved\r\npretty fast in the past few years. I suppose it takes people\'s emotional\r\nreactions a while to catch up with developments that, logically, we\r\naccept as matter of fact."\r\n\r\nHe pushed his chair back from the desk, "Maybe it\'s not too hard to\r\nunderstand. Take \'fire\' for example: Man lived in fear of fire for a\r\ngood many hundred-thousand years--and rightly so, because he hadn\'t\r\nlearned to control it. The principle\'s the same; First you learn to\r\nprotect yourself from a thing; then control it; and, eventually, we\r\nlearn to \'harness\' it for a useful purpose." He gestured toward the\r\nman\'s cigarette, "Even so, man still instinctively fears fire--even\r\nwhile he uses it. In the case of tissue-regeneration, where the change\r\ntook place so rapidly, in just a generation or so, that instinctive fear\r\nis even more understandable--although quite as unjustified, I assure\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nThe doctor stood up, indicating that the session was ending. While his\r\npatient scrambled to his feet, hastily putting out his cigarette, the\r\nphysician came around the desk. He put his hand on the man\'s shoulder,\r\n"Relax, take it easy--nothing to worry about. This is a wonderful age we\r\nlive in. Barring a really major accident, there\'s no reason why you\r\nshouldn\'t live at least another seventy-five years. After all, that\'s a\r\nvery remarkable viral-complex we have doing your \'repair\' work."\r\n\r\nAs they walked to the door, the man shook his head, "Guess you\'re right,\r\nDoc. It\'s certainly done a good job so far, and I guess you specialists\r\nknow what you\'re doing, even if folks don\'t understand it.

"\r\n\r\nAt the door he paused and half turned to the doctor, "But say ...\r\nsomething I meant to ask you. This \'stuff\' ... er, this vaccine ...\r\nwhere did it come from? Seems to me I heard somewhere that, way back\r\nbefore you fellows got it \'tamed\' it was something else--dangerous.\r\nThere was another name for it. Do you know what I mean?

"\r\n\r\nThe doctor\'s hand tightened on the doorknob. "Yes, I know," he said\r\ngrimly, "but not many laymen remember. Just keep in mind what I told\r\nyou. 

With any of these things, the pattern is protection, then control,\r\nthen useful application." He turned to face his patient, "Back in the\r\ndays before we put it to work for us--rebuilding tissue, almost ending\r\naging and disease--the active basis for our vaccine caused a whole group\r\nof diseases, in itself."\r\n\r\nReturning the man\'s searching gaze, the doctor opened the door, "We\'ve\r\ncome a long way since then. You see," he said quietly, "in those days\r\nthey called it \'cancer\'."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Analog_ September 1962.

]\r\n\r\n\r\n"I\'m only here to help you," said the man from Mars.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve proved that," the Secretary admitted. "In the six weeks that\r\nyou\'ve been here, you\'ve wiped out rabies, measles, and the common\r\ncold: but sir, this latest proposal of yours is blasphemous!"\r\n\r\nThe man from Mars waved an appendage in the direction of the\r\nSecretary\'s desk, atop which a newspaper was lying open. 

"After\r\nreading what that paper has to say can you still doubt that what I\r\npropose is necessary?"\r\n\r\nThe young man in uniform crossed the room and picked up the newspaper.\r\nHe read the headlines aloud, bitterly: "INDIAN FAMINE ARMY STORMS NEW\r\nDELHI"; "TASMAN REPUBLIC BIDS FOR PLACE IN SUN"; "PLAGUE DECIMATES\r\nLOWER NILE."\r\n\r\n"You could end that plague." The Assistant\'s voice was accusing.\r\n\r\n"I could, of course. The battles and the starvation would still be\r\nwith you, though. Why do you persist in treating the symptoms instead\r\nof the sickness? I am an objective observer, far enough away from your\r\nproblems to see them clearly, something which no human can ever hope\r\nto do. You Earthlings suffer war and famine and plague for one reason\r\nonly: that there are four and eight-tenths billion of you living on an\r\nEarth which can feed only about two and a half billion of you well.\r\nGentlemen, the population of your planet must be reduced by one-half if\r\nyour race is to survive."\r\n\r\n"Couldn\'t we send our surplus population to Mars, or to Venus?" the\r\nAssistant asked.\r\n\r\nThe man from Mars winced. "The sands of Mars can\'t support cactuses,\r\nmuch less fields of wheat and rice and corn. Venus is a solid sea of\r\nformaldehyde solution." He glanced around to each of the three men in\r\nthe room. 

"To you, my scheme may seem heartless. But would it be more\r\ncruel to kill millions now than to allow billions to die in continual\r\nwar in the next thousand years? Do you remember your last such war?\r\nThe Ukrainian wheatlands scorched to desert by the thermonuclears? New\r\nEngland swept by epidemics of anthrax and tularemia? All China tortured\r\nby starvation and the hundred nagging sicknesses that follow hunger?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I remember." 

The Secretary rolled his pen between his fingers,\r\nstaring at it. "How do you intend to--liquidate--the excess two\r\nbillions?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t explain it to you; you lack the basic knowledge. 

It will be\r\nquick and painless though, I promise. 

Then Earth will see peace and\r\nhope; a new start!"\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t take all the responsibility for this decision upon myself,"\r\nthe Secretary said. He glanced hopefully toward the Assistant and the\r\nyoung man in uniform. Their eyes flinched away.\r\n\r\n"You might take a vote," suggested the man from Mars. He picked up the\r\nSecretary\'s scratch pad and ripped off three sheets of paper. "Just\r\nmark _Yes_ or _No_. 

I will respect your decision: after all, I\'m only\r\nhere to help you."\r\n\r\nThe Secretary stared at the slip of paper lying on his desk. He glanced\r\ntoward the other two humans for encouragement; but the Assistant was\r\nstaring at the wall across the room, and the young man in uniform was\r\nsilently contemplating the carpet at his feet.\r\n\r\nConvulsively the Secretary scooched the paper toward him and scribbled\r\nhis vote. Folding the paper, he looked demandingly toward his two\r\ncompanions. The young man in uniform looked up, then turned to hold his\r\npaper against the wall as he wrote his decision. The Assistant remained\r\nseated, holding the paper on top of a book while he lettered out his\r\nvote.\r\n\r\nThe man from Mars collected the three ballots, unfolded them, and read\r\nthe three votes. "It\'s two to one," he announced. He crushed the papers\r\ninto small, white pellets and tossed them out the open window. "What I\r\nhave to do will be finished by noon tomorrow."\r\n\r\nThe man from Mars left the room, closing the door very softly behind\r\nhim. The other three sat silent a moment and then got up and left\r\nwithout looking one another in the face.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next day the Secretary and the Assistant sat in the office, staring\r\nat the clock above the door. At twelve-oh-seven the door slammed open\r\nfor the young man in uniform.\r\n\r\n"Is it done?" the Assistant asked.\r\n\r\n"Done? Of course, it\'s done!" The young man in uniform leaned against\r\nthe door and shook with spasmic laughter. "Now there\'s food enough\r\nand room enough for everyone. The man from Mars promised to solve our\r\npopulation problem. 

He did. At twelve noon, Eastern Daylight Saving\r\nTime, every woman and girl on Earth dropped dead."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n

Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are\r\nparticularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.\r\nCompliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable\r\neffort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these\r\nrequirements. 

We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not\r\nreceived written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or\r\ndetermine the status of compliance for any particular state visit\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have\r\nnot met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against\r\naccepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us\r\nwith offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any\r\nstatements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the\r\nUnited States.

Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with\r\nanyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm\r\neBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions,\r\nall of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright\r\nnotice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance\r\nwith any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook\xe2\x80\x99s eBook\r\nnumber, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed\r\n(zipped), HTML and others.\r\n\r\nCorrected _editions_ of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the\r\nold filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.\r\n_Versions_ based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\r\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n\r\n    http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how\r\nto make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation,\r\nhow to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email\r\nnewsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***FINIS***\r\n'




]\r\n\r\n\r\n10 years of uneasy peace, since the Hour of Tragedy ... ten\r\napprehensive, uneasy years pungent with fear, with hatred, distrust ...\r\nten years like ten thousand in the past of man ... ten units out of the\r\ninfinite, out of time the eternal, immutable, nonexistent dimension....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n9 planets spinning ... nine spawn of the sun, one of them nascent, a\r\nhairsbreadth from its heritage. But which heritage? It could choose.\r\nThe fertile warmth of the parent star ... or the star's pure fire?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n8 periods, in the gibberish of the sifters of chaos ... eight:\r\nPre-Cambrian to Triassic--while flame cooled and became stone and lay\r\nlatent, lambent, pent awaiting release--before from the fetid Jurassic\r\ndarknesses the beasts of warm blood crawled.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n7 seas, once the womb of life, then too long its caul ... the common\r\nbirthplace, then a strangling wall between. (Once too, briefly a\r\nhigh road for the courageous, now a new kind of night for marauders,\r\nshadowed shapes armed with pieces of the sun.

)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n6 masses of land, cradles for the genesis of a myriad species ...\r\nand one of them Man. Man the Creator, the Protector, the Destroyer:\r\nbuilder of shrines, burner of saints, good father, good soldier, good\r\nkiller.... Man, the creature of choice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n5 nations remaining, sparse ruddy fruit of a thousand wars, nurtured by\r\na billion dead. Five, the bloody consequence of union into pack, into\r\ntribe, into fief, to kingdom, empire and nation. 

The threads of history\r\ngathered finally into five flags, entwined in alliance at this point in\r\ntime by a searing wind: Pan-American, Sino-Russian, Afro-Arabian ...\r\nracial armies, sons of the first beast to kill from anger, fathers of\r\nthe unborn. Armies in the terrible truce of the fusion bomb ... waiting.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n4 farflung networks: metal wire and machines, and vacuum. Interlinked\r\nwebs of detection and retaliation or attack, within the webs bombs ...\r\nwithin the bombs targets, mapped and doomed by a spark. Each alliance\r\na network of aimed and armed missiles, in deserts, on mountaintops,\r\nhidden deep and in the surrounding seas. Each alliance a pattern of\r\ntargets, always an instant from obliteration.\r\n\r\n(Such had come to Britain in its Hour of Tragedy when the last savage\r\nhope of Empire Regained dissolved into vapor, and the Isles became\r\nslag. There the fourth network corroded under a shroud of ash; but the\r\nsurviving three ceaselessly hummed.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n3 men, of one species but riven somehow at this point in time by\r\npigment, tongue and details of dress: a man from Brownsville, a man\r\nfrom Vladivostok, a man from Khartoum ... buried deep in the hearts\r\nof the networks, each already entombed, and so safe from death. Each\r\nchosen by his masters to be the nock of the arrow, the final factor;\r\nyet not an arrow, for each network of course was aimed at both the\r\nothers. A moment's trust is fatal once the truce is broken, the masters\r\nreasoned, and so the bombs and the men were trained.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n2 buttons, a choice under the fingers of each of these men: one, red,\r\nto loose deliberately the double pronged torrent of bombs if the\r\nmasters so decreed. The other, white, to cancel the launching command\r\nbroadcast automatically if massive radiation spewed across the\r\nhomeland ... a vast, vicious death reflex. Each man, then, if the\r\ndetectors tolled, had the decision: error or attack. 

Fail or be unable\r\nto press the white instantly, and the counter-attack, if such it was,\r\nbegan. This, then, was the masters' last concession to the human\r\nfactor, their grudging one to humanity.\r\n\r\nAnd like most of the masters' concessions to the masses, it was false.\r\nIdentically, in each network, the white button was a dummy. The real\r\nchoice was as it always was--red button, kill ... or wait yet a while\r\nmore. The men in the tombs, unknowing, knew this was the choice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1 man's brain, whosoever, however carefully masters may mold it, is\r\na fragile thing. Ten thousand years have not fitted man to live with\r\nhimself; could a single man live with the lives of two billion? The\r\nchoice, distillate of a hundred centuries of pain, the weariness of a\r\nspecies with race: blame them, blame all. 

One of the men sitting in a\r\ncold tomb sweated. His finger hovered over the red button, trembled ...\r\nand fell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


The youngster was frightened.\r\n\r\n"Dark, very dark, and big. It moves fast, but we\'ll keep up with it."\r\nThe tone was consciously reassuring.\r\n\r\n"Dark, Grandpa?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, it sucks heat and absorbs light. You\'ll find out when you\'re old\r\nand strong enough to swim down to the bottom and see what\'s there. 

Now\r\nstay with me when we follow it, and don\'t get lost in the crowd; and\r\ndon\'t get ahead of me or get too close to it--you might take in too\r\nmuch, and get overcharged."\r\n\r\n"What\'s \'overcharged,\' Grandpa? Can you really get too much?" The\r\nyoungster jigged up and down a little with excitement and\r\nanticipation.\r\n\r\nFor a moment, the oldster turned his attention from watching for the\r\nthing that was coming, and considered him fondly. "Poor youngling. 

I\r\nforget. You\'ve had no chance to learn what it means to get enough.\r\nYou\'re too young to ride the storms and tap the lightnings.... Listen\r\nnow. When a grownup has to let out a flash of blue light, that means\r\nthat he\'s overcharged and spinning off balance inside, and so he has\r\nto save himself by letting out his energy to let down the pressure. So\r\nbe careful; take enough, but don\'t be greedy and take in too much too\r\nsuddenly. 

Now let\'s just float here with the others and be ready.

"\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful bright day. The sun poured down its flood of light,\r\nhere and there energizing a molecule of the blue air into little\r\nsparkles of ionization; and below, a mist of bright clouds half veiled\r\nthe darkness that was the bottom.\r\n\r\n"What\'s it mean when someone blinks blue light in lots of flashes, and\r\nthen glows red and starts sinking, huh, Grandpa?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you later when you\'re older. 

Just be careful and don\'t get\r\ntoo close." He was abruptly excited. 

"Here it comes!"\r\n\r\nOut of the blue translucence far below, a black dot appeared and grew\r\nrapidly, rushing closer until it was a huge fish-shaped object with\r\nwidespread fins, rushing towards them. It would pass slightly to the\r\nleft of them, and already the waiting crowd was moving to intercept\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIt flashed by, and the youngster thought they were going to lose\r\nit--it was going so much faster than they; but as the thought crossed\r\nhis mind, and he saw the two churning glowing openings in its rear, a\r\nburning blast of energy struck him. A multitude of glowing, charged\r\nparticles crackled around him, streamed against him. His fields\r\nshifted to reach out and capture them; the spin of stored energy\r\nwithin spun faster, absorbing the new energy into its drive, its\r\nlife-pulse rising to a deep hum, and he felt strong, stronger than he\r\nhad ever felt before in his life.\r\n\r\nThey were flying faster now, accelerating faster than he had ever\r\nflown, and it was easy. They drew up closer to the dark thing,\r\nmatching it speed for speed, laving in the glowing cloud of\r\nenergy-particles that roared backward from its jets. The youngster was\r\nastounded and exhilarated at the tremendous, effortless speed with\r\nwhich they were driving forward. This was the first time he had ever\r\nhad so much power. It was ten times more than any aurora borealis with\r\nits pale wash of energy waves.\r\n\r\nDrunken in his new found strength, he pulled ahead closer to the\r\nroaring jets.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the peak of the arc of climb of the New York-Istanbul stratoliner,\r\nhigh in the ionosphere where the Earth was merely a giant globe far\r\nbelow, the pilot of the stratoliner boredly cut the jets for the\r\nfuel-saving glide that turned their nose toward Earth again.\r\n\r\nThe radar was clanging its usual senseless warning of imminent\r\ncollision with some solid objects, which had approached closer than\r\nthe automatic relays considered safe. It had been clanging for several\r\nminutes. The pilot glanced in annoyance at the radar screen, where\r\nseveral hundred globes--from two to seven feet in diameter--showed\r\nvividly, trailing the ship in a fan-shaped cluster. "Some day I\'m\r\ngoing to take a hammer to that thing."\r\n\r\nThe co-pilot, looking back from the control blister\'s rear window, saw\r\nnothing, as usual, except a few of the shining globes, which showed\r\nthemselves transiently in a brief flash of blue light as they\r\ncarelessly overloaded and discharged--and one, smaller than the rest,\r\nwho blinked on and off rapidly in brilliant flashes of blue. As he\r\nwatched, it ran suddenly down the color-scale to red and began to lag\r\nbehind, a glowing red globe, sinking.\r\n\r\n"I wonder what the hell they think they\'re doing?" he grumbled.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first terrestrial expedition to Mars didn\'t find any Martians.\r\nNeither did the second. Since there are so few Martians left, those\r\nfacts are less surprising than that the third did.\r\n\r\nFor many years before space flight was accomplished, there had been\r\ndiscussions and theories about how to communicate with Martians, if any\r\nexisted. But, of course, nobody was ready when the time came.\r\n\r\nThey fell back on that antiquated gimmick.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVon Frisch, Riley and Smith watched the half dozen Martians approach,\r\nand their watching was not without some trepidation. Except that they\r\nwere about twenty miles away from their G-boat--the planetary landing\r\ncraft--they probably would have fled. Except that they had their\r\norders, they probably would have shot first and asked questions later.\r\n\r\n"Sir, this is Von Frisch," said the engineer into the microphone of his\r\nhelmet. He was a little breathless about it. 

"We\'re being approached by\r\nMartians!"\r\n\r\n"How do they act?" asked Captains Powers back at the G-boat,\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n"They don\'t act hostile, sir."\r\n\r\n"Stand by, then, but don\'t take any chances. 

What do they look like?"\r\n\r\n"They\'re quite a bit taller than we are, but their bodies are round\r\nand not much bigger than a child\'s. They\'ve got real long legs and\r\narms, and big heads with big eyes and ears."\r\n\r\n"Are they intelligent? Are they civilized? How do they breathe?"\r\n\r\n"Wait a minute, Captain," protested Von Frisch. "You\'re going a little\r\ntoo fast, sir. 

They\'ve just come up to us. I don\'t know whether that\'s\r\nfur on them or whether they\'re wearing clothes.

"\r\n\r\n"Well, try to communicate with them, man!" 

exclaimed Powers excitedly.\r\n\r\nVon Frisch did his best. The Martians appeared friendly enough, and\r\ninterested. Von Frisch tried to communicate in the only method he had\r\nheard about.\r\n\r\nWhile his companions watched curiously, he shut his ears to the running\r\nfire of questions from Powers, squatted and drew a right angled\r\ntriangle in the red desert sand. By one of the sides he drew three\r\nmarks, by another four.\r\n\r\nThen he stepped back and looked questioningly at the Martians.\r\n\r\nOne of the Martians squatted in a tangle of pipestem arms and legs, and\r\nwith a long finger drew five lines beside the triangle\'s hypotenuse.\r\n\r\n"They understand the Pythagorean theorem, sir!" exclaimed Von Frisch.\r\n\r\n"Good! They undoubtedly know some astronomy, then. Go on."\r\n\r\nVon Frisch hesitated a moment, then erased the triangle. He drew a\r\nsmall circle with rays from it, for the sun. He drew four larger\r\nconcentric circles around it, with small circles for planets on the\r\nrim of each one.\r\n\r\nHe pointed to the third planet, then at himself, then at his\r\ncompanions, one by one. Then he pointed at the fourth planet and at the\r\nMartians, one by one. To complete the matter, he pointed at the sky.\r\n\r\n"We are Earthmen," he said. "You are Martians."\r\n\r\nThe trouble was that the Earthmen didn\'t realize the things the\r\nMartians had were weapons until they used them. They didn\'t realize it\r\nthen, as a matter of fact, because the Earthmen were dead, all three of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n_The Martian hunting party came back from the desert with word of the\r\nstrange creatures who came, apparently, from another world._\r\n\r\n_"Whether they have weapons, we do not know," said the leader of the\r\nhunting party. "But they wished to harm our people, so we killed them\r\nall.

"_\r\n\r\n_"That is desperate action," said the patriarch of the village. "In\r\nwhat way were they dangerous to us?"_\r\n\r\n_"Foolishly they disclosed their intention to us," replied the leader\r\nof the hunting party. "They informed us they planned to take over our\r\nworld and to drive our people farther from the sun, to the great planet\r\nJupiter."_\r\n\r\n_"Then you did right," said the patriarch, blinking his big eyes._\r\n\r\nBiggs and Golden were working near the G-boat. Their helmet radios were\r\nset to a different channel from that used by the exploring party, so\r\nthey were unable to hear Captain Powers shouting frantically into his\r\nmicrophone and getting no answer. It was just after sunset, and Biggs\r\nwas looking into the west.\r\n\r\n"We ought to see it now, but it ain\'t there," commented Biggs.\r\n\r\n"What ain\'t there?" demanded Golden.\r\n\r\n"Mercury," said Biggs, who prided himself on being an amateur\r\nastronomer. "I reckon you can\'t see it from Mars without a telescope.\r\nToo close to the sun."\r\n\r\nHe chuckled.\r\n\r\n"If there are any Martians," he added, "I reckon they think _they_ live\r\non the third planet. That\'s funny, ain\'t it?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were usually a few Customs Inspectors in the lounge, waiting\r\nto begin their shifts, hanging around trading news and incidents and\r\ndrinking the bad, lukewarm kasser that was a standing joke in the\r\nImmigration-Customs Service.\r\n\r\nOld Grag was telling for perhaps the eightieth time of a success of his\r\nwhen he was young in the Service.\r\n\r\n"... They had this small box of sticky, squashy sweets with them. The\r\nyoung one was eating one. 

Many another Inspector would have passed them\r\nthrough, but I thought the young one chewed too much and too loud. So I\r\nsaid, \'Mind if I have one?\'\r\n\r\n"\'Wah!\' says they together, \'it would set you on edge, Noble Wise\r\nInspector. It is the taste of another world.\' They was Venusers, and\r\nthey started shifting and hopping around, and humming their national\r\nanthem, _you_ know how they used to do back in the old days. I made\r\nquite a nice little find. Almost a half-scree of chamfer in each one\r\nof those sweets. I got a promotion out of that, and the Venusers got a\r\nsix-year close out."\r\n\r\nInspector Flimp blew one of his noses loudly.\r\n\r\n"Hee, that\'s nothing. _I_ recall back when we first opened up for\r\nImmigration, and a whole shipload of earthers came in. They were\r\ncrammed in like tigs in a nest, and as usual they didn\'t know one word\r\nof the language, they didn\'t have any idea of where to go or how to do\r\nanything, and they\'d got separated from their controller. 

They just\r\nstood around, huddled together and jabbering at each other. 

Well, I\r\nchecked out about twenty of them, and then there comes up this big ugly\r\nfemale. Well, I jacks the elevator up some more, and I looks down at\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"\'Name!\', I call. \'Gladdis Cracklegill,\' or some other weird earth name\r\nshe screams at me. \'Too much name,\' I say. \'You\'ve got enough name\r\nthere for five of you. Which will you choose, Glad, Is, Crack, El or\r\nGil?\'\r\n\r\n"Well, it took me a while to make her understand me--my earth accent\r\nwasn\'t too good then, and she was slow-headed, having only one, like\r\nall earthers. But I finally made her understand what I wanted to know,\r\nand then, by Clag, what a ramping frowst she did make!\r\n\r\n"It was while she was screeching at me that I noticed her teeth were\r\npretty big, even for such a huge beast as she was. So I secretly turned\r\non the Dento-Spyer, right into her jaws, and what a sight on the view\r\nscreen! Each of those big teeth was false and filled to the top with\r\nEarth seeds she was trying to smuggle!"\r\n\r\n"Earthers!" exploded young Nask. 

"They make me sick!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m with you, Nask," said Inspector Sprim. "And I don\'t understand why\r\nthey _still_ keep routing earthers through Immigration anyway. They\r\nclaim they\'re a borderline case, but when you\'ve seen as many as I\r\nhave, you know, which side of the border they\'re on."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNask went off to the kasser dispenser and his place was taken by Brif,\r\nthe head Inspector, who had been listening.\r\n\r\n"Un-edge yourself, Sprim," smiled Brif, contracting one of his heads.\r\n"I have good news, rare news and fine news. The Four Council decision\r\njust came down to us. Earthers are now to be routed through Livestock\r\ninstead of Immigration beginning very soon."\r\n\r\nA cheer went up from the little group of Customs and Immigration\r\nofficials. The one Livestock Inspector in the lounge groaned in despair.\r\n\r\nOld Inspector Flimp seemed bothered.\r\n\r\n"They\'ve made themselves a mistake," he sputtered. "Earthers can be\r\nclever and tricky even after they\'re altered. Why, I seen them pull\r\nevery trick in the book coming through here. 

Did I ever tell you about\r\nthe stunted one with an artificial head who tried to pass himself off\r\nas a rest-park planner? Well, it seems that...."\r\n\r\nTwo young, but large inspectors sneaked away from the group when they\r\nsaw old Flimp was launched into one of his dull yarns again.\r\n\r\nOutside the lounge, after a quick look up and down the hall, they\r\nducked into the robot-cleaner storage closet.\r\n\r\n"Boy," gasped the shorter inspector. "I _had_ to get out of there.\r\nBesides the torture of listening to that two-headed monster babble on\r\nand on about how he outwitted earthers when he was still able to move\r\naround, this miserable thing has started to come loose again."\r\n\r\nHe gave an impatient wrench to his left head, and it wobbled enough to\r\nexpose some of the delicate wires that the earth robotic engineer had\r\nlabored over so many hours.\r\n\r\nThe other began tightening straps and buckles for him.\r\n\r\n"There," he said finally. "You look like one of the boys again."\r\n\r\nLaughing together, the earthers went back into the Customs Lounge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


He would not\r\nremember the dark spaceways or the red slag of Martian drylands or the\r\npearl-gray days on Venus when he had dreamed of the Earth that had\r\noutlawed him. So he lay, with his eyes closed and the sunlight drenching\r\nhim through, no sound in his ears but the passage of a breeze through\r\nthe grass and a creaking of some insect nearby--the violent,\r\nblood-smelling years behind him might never have been. Except for the\r\ngun pressed into his ribs between his chest and the clovered earth, he\r\nmight be a boy again, years upon years ago, long before he had broken\r\nhis first law or killed his first man.\r\n\r\nNo one else alive now knew who that boy had been. Not even the all\r\nknowing Patrol. Not even Venusian Yarol, who had been his closest friend\r\nfor so many riotous years. 

No one would ever know--now. Not his name\r\n(which had not always been Smith) or his native land or the home that\r\nhad bred him, or the first violent deed that had sent him down the\r\ndevious paths which led here--here to the clover hollow in the hills of\r\nan Earth that had forbidden him ever to set foot again upon her soil.\r\n\r\nHe unclasped the hands behind his head and rolled over to lay a scarred\r\ncheek on his arm, smiling to himself. Well, here was Earth beneath him.\r\nNo longer a green star high in alien skies, but warm soil, new clover so\r\nnear his face he could see all the little stems and trefoil leaves,\r\nmoist earth granular at their roots. An ant ran by with waving antennae\r\nclose beside his cheek. He closed his eyes and drew another deep breath.\r\nBetter not even look; better to lie here like an animal, absorbing the\r\nsun and the feel of Earth blindly, wordlessly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow he was not Northwest Smith, scarred outlaw of the spaceways. Now he\r\nwas a boy again with all his life before him. 

There would be a\r\nwhite-columned house just over the hill, with shaded porches and white\r\ncurtains blowing in the breeze and the sound of sweet, familiar voices\r\nindoors. There would be a girl with hair like poured honey hesitating\r\njust inside the door, lifting her eyes to him. Tears in the eyes. He lay\r\nvery still, remembering.\r\n\r\nCurious how vividly it all came back, though the house had been ashes\r\nfor nearly twenty years, and the girl--the girl ...\r\n\r\nHe rolled over violently, opening his eyes. No use remembering her.\r\nThere had been that fatal flaw in him from the very first, he knew now.\r\nIf he were the boy again knowing all he knew today, still the flaw would\r\nbe there and sooner or later the same thing must have happened that had\r\nhappened twenty years ago. He had been born for a wilder age, when men\r\ntook what they wanted and held what they could without respect for law.\r\nObedience was not in him, and so--\r\n\r\nAs vividly as on that day it happened he felt the same old surge of\r\nanger and despair twenty years old now, felt the ray-gun bucking hard\r\nagainst his unaccustomed fist, heard the hiss of its deadly charge\r\nravening into a face he hated. He could not be sorry, even now, for that\r\nfirst man he had killed. But in the smoke of that killing had gone up\r\nthe columned house and the future he might have had, the boy\r\nhimself--lost as Atlantis now--and the girl with the honey-colored hair\r\nand much, much else besides. It had to happen, he knew. 

He being the boy\r\nhe was, it had to happen. 

Even if he could go back and start all over,\r\nthe tale would be the same.\r\n\r\nAnd it was all long past now, anyhow; and nobody remembered any more at\r\nall, except himself. A man would be a fool to lie here thinking about it\r\nany longer.\r\n\r\nSmith grunted and sat up, shrugging the gun into place against his ribs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ January 1957.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

Angstrom was known to his students and many of his colleagues on\r\nthe faculty as "The Old Goat." Very appropriate, that name. 

He had the\r\ndisposition of a goat with dyspepsia, he had the cold blue eyes of a\r\ngoat, he had the waggling whiskers of a goat. Perhaps it\'s in memory of\r\nDr. Angstrom that Ivy College has a goat for its mascot now.\r\n\r\nDr. Angstrom was even more goatish than usual that day last summer when\r\nhalf a dozen top scientists in the field gathered to see his preview\r\nexperiment on matter transmission of a live animal. He had been working\r\nhard for weeks on the transmitter and keeping up classes at the same\r\ntime, which did not improve his disposition. Besides, he had a real\r\ngoat for an experimental animal, and goats are notoriously hard on the\r\nnervous system.\r\n\r\nThis particular animal, at the moment the scientists entered, was\r\nstraining at his rope, trying to get a mouthful of a tablecloth which\r\ngraced a nearby table full of jars and retorts. Failing this, the goat\r\nexhibited that typical lack of discrimination in matters edible and\r\nbegan to chew on his rope.\r\n\r\nI felt a little out of place among all these giant brains. My reason\r\nfor being there was that I had been serving, during my college career,\r\nas sort of a factotum and fetch-and-carry man for Dr. Angstrom, and\r\nI was to take notes for him. I had acquired considerable affection\r\nfor The Old Goat. Maybe that\'s one reason I hate to see his great\r\nscientific work kept under wraps because people still insist it\'s\r\ndangerous.\r\n\r\n"I have proved to my own satisfaction that the matter transmitter\r\nworks," Dr. Angstrom told the assembled scientists. "I have made a\r\nnumber of transmissions of inanimate matter. In theory, it should work\r\njust as well for animate objects and I have invited you to be present\r\nat the first test of this theory.\r\n\r\n"I need not go into detail with you about the basic theory of matter\r\ntransmission. The transmitter itself picks up the atomic and\r\nelectronic \'image\' of the object inside it, much as a television\r\nscanner picks up a scene, except that it is done in three dimensions\r\ninstead of two. This is made possible by the four-dimensional element\r\nwhich is the heart of the apparatus and was made available to us\r\nthrough recent intra-atomic research.\r\n\r\n"The receiver picks up the image as a television receiver does, except\r\nagain in three dimensions. The matter is not duplicated because the\r\ntransmitter strips down the object within it as it transmits.\r\n\r\n"Now the question that has been raised by some scientists about the\r\ntransmission of animate objects is whether the \'soul\' or \'life force\'\r\ncan be transmitted. I consider this question ridiculous, and will prove\r\nit so. It is my contention that such \'life force\' is not a thing apart\r\nfrom the physical shell."\r\n\r\nThe matter transmitter was a large closed cylinder on one side of the\r\nroom. 

The receiver was a similar cylinder on the other. Both were\r\nraised slightly from the floor.\r\n\r\nAs sort of _hors d\'oeuvre_, Dr. Angstrom transmitted a large chunk of\r\nlead across the room, then a glass jar. In each case, the object was\r\nplaced in the transmitter and a moment later removed from the receiver\r\nacross the room. There was no possible way for it to have been moved\r\nacross the intervening space except by broadcast transmission.\r\n\r\n"As you see," said Dr. Angstrom, "I have eliminated the necessity for\r\na switch by building the switch into the door of the transmitter. As\r\nsoon as the door is closed, transmission occurs. 

Now we shall send our\r\nanimate object."\r\n\r\nHe untied the goat and, with some difficulty, hauled the animal by its\r\ncollar to the transmitter. There the goat balked and Dr. Angstrom,\r\nhaving got its head through the door, got behind it and shoved\r\nheartily, hanging onto the edge of the door so he could shut it quickly\r\nwhen the goat was inside.\r\n\r\nAs goats will, the goat suddenly changed its mind and leaped into the\r\ntransmitter. Caught off balance, Dr. Angstrom fell in after it--and the\r\ndoor, given a last frantic jerk, slammed on them both.\r\n\r\nThere were gasps of horror and alarm from the scientists, but I held\r\nup my hand to calm them.\r\n\r\n"There\'s no danger, gentlemen," I said. "It\'s just as well this way. 

I\r\nhappen to know that Dr. Angstrom\'s next step, after proving to you with\r\nthe goat that animate objects could be transmitted, was to prove that\r\nhuman beings also could be transmitted. He planned to be his own first\r\nsubject."\r\n\r\nWith serene confidence, I went to the receiver and threw open the door.\r\nJust as I had anticipated, the goat leaped out, unharmed, followed by\r\nDr. Angstrom.\r\n\r\n"I told you animate objects could be transmitted successfully," said\r\nthe goat triumphantly.\r\n\r\n"Baa!" 

said Dr. Angstrom, and began eating the tablecloth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


But what happens next?_\r\n\r\n\r\n benefactor\r\n\r\n _by ... George H. Smith_\r\n\r\n\r\n He clutched at the lever with more force than he\'d\r\n intended. It was set for further in the future....\r\n\r\n\r\n"They\'re crazy! 

They\'re insane! That mob outside is made up of madmen,"\r\nJacob Clark told his young assistant, Bill Towney.\r\n\r\n"They\'ll be battering at the door any minute now, sir," Towney said\r\nnervously.\r\n\r\n"But why? Why are they doing it? 

My inventions have advanced the world a\r\nhundred years. I\'ve always been a benefactor of man, not a destroyer."\r\n\r\n"It\'s the robots. People are in a rage because they say the robots cause\r\nunemployment by replacing workers."\r\n\r\n"It\'s utter nonsense, you know," Clark said impatiently. "Why can\'t they\r\nsee that my intelligent, self-controlled robots are the greatest boon\r\nthe human race has ever received from one man?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, sir, but they don\'t." Towney paused as the shouting and\r\npounding outside became more intense. "They demanded that you take the\r\nrobots out of the labor market and order your factories to stop making\r\nthem. This is the result of your refusal."\r\n\r\n"DOWN WITH CLARK! DOWN WITH THE TIN MEN! 

DEATH TO THE ROBOT LOVERS!"\r\nThe furious mob was battering at the door now.\r\n\r\n"Really, sir," Towney said, "you should leave here. They\'ll kill you if\r\nyou don\'t!

"\r\n\r\n"Leave here? I should say not. I\'ll defy the fools. I\'ll tell them what\r\nI\'ve done for them and make them understand." He glanced nervously at\r\nthe door. "Besides there\'s only one door. I couldn\'t get away now."\r\n\r\n"There\'s the time machine, sir."\r\n\r\n"But isn\'t there some other way? Perhaps if you went out and talked to\r\nthem...."\r\n\r\n"You know there\'s no other way. Those people believe you\'ve brought\r\ndisaster to the human race and they mean to kill you. And if you don\'t\r\nhurry they will," Towney said urgently. "The time machine is set for\r\ntwenty years in the future. Please hurry, sir!"\r\n\r\nThe door was beginning to give. Clark looked around unhappily and then\r\nwalked to the time machine. "All right, I\'ll go. In the future I know\r\nthe results of my work will be appreciated. 

I\'ll be a hero and\r\nbenefactor of mankind."\r\n\r\nTowney heard the door crash and roughly pushed his employer into the\r\ntime machine as the mob burst through. "Push the starting button, push\r\nthe starting button. Quick!" 

he screamed as the first of the mob reached\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nClark\'s hand leaped to the control lever just as a brick crashed into\r\nhis head. His hand completed its motion with more force than he had\r\nintended as he sank unconscious to the floor and the machine was set for\r\na thousand years in the future instead of twenty.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe year three thousand had been a brilliant one for the robots, in\r\nfact, the most brilliant since the last human being had died some five\r\nhundred years before. They had reached Venus and Mars and were now\r\nplanning a trip to Jupiter. And this very day, a huge statue of Jacob\r\nClark, the creator and benefactor, was to be dedicated on the site of\r\nwhat once had been his laboratory. It seemed a shame that most of the\r\nrecords concerning him and his time had been lost in one of the great\r\nwars that had helped to extinguish the humans. The statue though was\r\ngood for surely he looked like a robot. One of the few human books still\r\nin existence said that the Creator had created in his own image.\r\n\r\nIt was right at the foot of his own statue that the Guardians of the\r\nShrine found Jacob Clark. They picked up his unconscious, bleeding body\r\nand laid it tenderly on a nearby bench. They bent over him with all the\r\ngentleness and solicitude that had been installed in his very first\r\nmodels and had been handed down from generation to generation of robots.\r\nThey wanted to help him but they were very puzzled.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it came from a far part of the earth," one of them said.\r\n\r\n"Or maybe a mistake was made at one of the birth factories," said\r\nanother. "See, it is losing oil at a great rate."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps," mused the elder, "it is a new model. At any rate it is a\r\nrobot and has been damaged. 

As our great creator taught us, he must be\r\naided. We will take it to the central repair factory in the city."\r\n\r\n"But," the first robot protested, "it\'s awfully bulky to be carried so\r\nfar."\r\n\r\nBeing creatures of logic, they thought about it for a moment and then\r\nthe elder came to a decision that was both effective and reasonable.\r\n\r\n"Since he is so bulky, we will disassemble him for transportation\r\npurposes," he said as he leaned over and gently twisted off Clark\'s\r\nright arm.\r\n\r\n"Rather primitive and messy construction, I\'d say," said the second\r\nrobot as he tenderly unscrewed Jacob Clark\'s head from his body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ August 1958.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

There were no eyes visible but\r\nHenderson had the chilly feeling that the flower was surveying the room.\r\nThen, after a moment, the plant jumped to the sill of the window, from\r\nthere to the seat of a chair. Then it slid down one of the legs of the\r\nchair to the floor.\r\n\r\nIt shook its leaves, lifted its blossom upward at the amazed Henderson\r\nfrozen in his chair, and the tiny squeaking voice said cheerily, "Hi,\r\nPal!" Then it started walking across the floor, toward the door,\r\nmuttering, "Somebody\'s got to answer that damned door bell."\r\n\r\nHenderson\'s legs came unfroze as it went through the doorway and he made\r\na wild dash after the walking geranium. It was padding down the hall,\r\nits roots making little patting sounds on the linoleum as he passed it.\r\n\r\nHenderson opened the door, and only then did he begin to realize the\r\nscope his rays must have!\r\n\r\nHe stood, jaws agape, looking down at the rose-bush which stood outside\r\nthe door. His mouth opened and words tried to come out. 

But the bush\r\nspoke first.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been ringing this bell for hours," it said petulantly. "Some nasty\r\nboys have been picking my roses and I\'m getting sore!"\r\n\r\nHenderson fainted then, and the last thing he remembered was the voice\r\nof the geranium saying:\r\n\r\n"Hi, Babe, come on in. 

I been watching _you_ for a long time!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ March 1954.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt took me less than three thousand years to catch up with Pop; which,\r\nall things considered, was pretty good going. I came out of overdrive\r\nat 018970 hours in orbit around an ugly-looking A3-type planet, and\r\nthere was his ship below me.\r\n\r\nI slammed my cruiser down right alongside--hard enough to pulverize a\r\ncouple of feet of basalt and make Pop and his ship bounce a little.\r\nHe\'d put me to quite a bit of trouble and I was annoyed.\r\n\r\nPop got to his feet and stood there looking kind of sheepish as I\r\nclimbed out of the cruiser. The old fool had his helmet off and was\r\nbreathing in the foul atmosphere as if it were health gas. His gills\r\nhad begun to turn a little blue from the methane and CO2. He was a\r\ncharacter all right.\r\n\r\nHis name wasn\'t really Pop, of course. I guess the nickname had been\r\ntacked on because he was such an eccentric, old codger, and because\r\nhe looked like a couple of billion years old. Actually, of course, he\r\nwasn\'t nearly that old.\r\n\r\n"Welcome aboard planet," he said. "I kind of figured you\'d be along\r\nsooner or later. Or someone like you."\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m here," I said. He looked harmless, but I kept a 201R\r\nprojector on him just in case. Pop had given Security Division a lot of\r\ntrouble, and I had strict orders.\r\n\r\nI crawled over to his ship and slid inside. The cabin looked neat\r\nenough, but the old fool had so much junk crammed into the ship you\r\ncould hardly turn around. I found what I was looking for toward the\r\nbow--row after row of cylindrical canisters. I broke one open and the\r\nbio-detector on my back began to stutter like crazy. I dropped it and\r\nsprayed them all until they glowed dull green. By then the contents\r\nwere cooked.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPop was still standing in the same place when I crawled out, looking as\r\ncasual as you please. He only had a few eyes on me. Most of them he had\r\nturned toward the planet\'s oversize satellite and a raw, angry-looking\r\nsea that was breaking a few ship\'s-lengths away.\r\n\r\n"How\'d you catch up with me?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Space warp. You left a trail a child could follow." I moved around\r\nhis ship and found the reason he was looking so innocent. He\'d already\r\nset up one of his canisters and the seal was about to break. I sprayed\r\nit. So much for several billion one-celled forms of life bottled under\r\npressure.\r\n\r\n"All right," I said. "That\'s the last of them. Let\'s get going."\r\n\r\n"Okay," said Pop. "Never argue with Security Division. Still, you\'ve\r\ngot to admit I gave you a good run for your money. And I seeded quite\r\na mess of planets."\r\n\r\nI shouldn\'t have done it, but I was angry. I snapped a claw across his\r\nnerve center before he could draw it back into his shell. It must have\r\nhurt plenty, because ten or twelve of his eyes began to water.\r\n\r\n"Seeded, hell!" I said. "You touched down on exactly 9080 planets, and\r\nI sterilized every one of them after you left. That\'s what took me so\r\nlong."\r\n\r\nHe seemed to shrink a little inside, and for the first time I realized\r\njust how old the nut really was.\r\n\r\n"All that time," he said. "All that effort wasted. 

Damn. 

Double damn.

"\r\n\r\n"You should have figured that in the first place," I said. "Central\r\nMaxim 0438 clearly states that no life is to be introduced into the\r\nouter galaxies. And don\'t ask me why. 

I\'m no biologist. I just follow\r\norders."\r\n\r\n"Listen," said Pop. 

"_Please_ listen. Back at Central Galaxy they think\r\nwe--our race--is pretty much immortal. But they don\'t _know_. They\r\ndon\'t know for sure if _any_ life will be left in our galaxy after two\r\nor three hundred wars like the last one and--"\r\n\r\n"Hold it," I said. "You\'re wasting your time. 

I\'m not a philosopher and\r\nyou know it."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right," said Pop. "And you\'re not a biologist, either. You\r\ntold me." He waved a claw in gesture of resignation number seven.\r\n"Well, maybe you\'re right. Maybe I have been an old fool. 

Let\'s go\r\nhome. No use hanging around an ugly planet like this one." He made\r\ngesture of contempt number fifteen.\r\n\r\nWell, I thought, that\'s a relief. Maybe the old geezer wasn\'t as crazy\r\nas I\'d figured. Maybe he just needed some sense slapped into him. At\r\nany rate, he didn\'t make any trouble when I disintegrated his ship--the\r\nold crate wasn\'t spaceworthy to begin with--and he climbed into my\r\ncruiser meek as could be.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI put the drive in low and pulled out of the system. The next\r\nplanet--Pop had landed on the third--was going through G14\r\ndisintegration into asteroids, but I eased through without any trouble\r\nand began to pick up speed.\r\n\r\nJust then Pop swung around in his seat and made good-luck gesture eight\r\nand long-life gesture twelve toward the planet we\'d left.\r\n\r\nI stared at him. "I don\'t get it," I said. "Just a while ago you\r\nagreed that was an ugly hunk of rock. You even made contempt gesture\r\nfifteen--you spat on it."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right," said Pop. "I did, didn\'t I? Right into a pool of\r\nbrackish water." 

Then he began to chuckle. He kept on chuckling for\r\nfive years, until I got annoyed and slapped his nerve center again.\r\n\r\nAside from that, the return voyage was uneventful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rocket waited, a gleaming yellow-finned tube, pointing its nose at\r\nthe depths of space. Time ticked in the control tower which rested in\r\nthe shadow of the great monster. Six minutes left. Sunlight danced on\r\nsilver curves.\r\n\r\nTick, tick, tick, tick. The time was in Charters\' brain like the sound\r\nof a pendulum in a grandfather\'s clock. The end was nearing.\r\n\r\nIt was almost over.\r\n\r\nCharters turned his thick wrist and looked at his watch.\r\n\r\nOutside the sun was a strong white fire in a blue sky. Sand stretched\r\naway endlessly from the circular cluster of buildings, from which the\r\nrocket had been conceived and nurtured and born.\r\n\r\nSeconds crept, and there was a dead silence in the tower room.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve done it," Charters said, his voice like a snapping of brittle\r\nwires.\r\n\r\nLampson, his assistant, nodded and watched the rocket. "Yes," he said.\r\n\r\n"Greatest victory of the age!" said Charters, grinning and gaily wiping\r\nhis hands together.\r\n\r\nLampson watched the way the sun struck the glistening silver body of\r\nthe rocket.\r\n\r\n"Have you nothing to say, man?" Charters asked.\r\n\r\n"I was just thinking."\r\n\r\n"This is no time to think," Charters said, his eyes bright and winking.\r\n"This is a time to let your thoughts drain out of your head. To feel\r\nthe damned meaning of this thing! 

To let it get inside you and fill you\r\nup to the brains! This is the time to laugh and cry, Lampson. To let\r\nyour insides quiver with the pure joy of it! We\'ve done it!"\r\n\r\n"Yes," Lampson said. "Only I was thinking about Randall, sitting out\r\nthere, waiting."\r\n\r\n"He\'ll be all right."\r\n\r\n"I know he will. I don\'t mean that. I mean, the way he feels about\r\nthings, yet sitting there, waiting to guide it to the Moon, to prove\r\nits reality. And all the time, he--"\r\n\r\n"He\'s caught in a stream, Lampson. A swift, driving stream that won\'t\r\nlet him stop. He can\'t help himself."\r\n\r\nLampson shook his head. "I can\'t believe he\'s really going through with\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"He\'s different now," Charters said. "A few months ago, he had all\r\nthese ideas about the rocket being used for military reasons, for\r\nkilling, and all that other nonsense. Now he\'s caught in the grip\r\nof this thing. He\'s watched his own work blossom and turn into a\r\nremarkably beautiful finished miracle."\r\n\r\nCharters watched the rocket, eyes half-closed, seeming to feel the\r\nstrength of it in his own hands as he closed them slowly, tightly.\r\n\r\n"Ah--" he said, lips curling. "The beautiful, beautiful thing!"\r\n\r\nLampson watched through the thick window, unblinking. 

"He was right,\r\nyou know."\r\n\r\n"Who was right?"\r\n\r\n"Randall. He was right about this rocket. We won\'t use it for anything\r\nbut just another weapon. 

All this work and planning. All Randall\'s\r\nsweat and blood. For no reason, but just another weapon."\r\n\r\n"It\'s too late now."\r\n\r\n"Yes. And you knew it, didn\'t you?" Lampson said to Charters, looking\r\nat the man. "You knew what this would mean. 

When Randall wanted to\r\nquit, and you finally got him to go ahead, you knew what we\'d use it\r\nfor."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t quit after ten years." Charters looked at his watch,\r\ncounting silently.\r\n\r\n"He\'s been sold out," Lampson said, thinking of Randall, sitting in the\r\nrocket. "A lifetime of worry and work and prayer. Now he\'s been sold\r\nout."\r\n\r\n"Damn it, man," Charters said, "it\'s nearly ready to happen!"\r\n\r\nThe room was silent, and the ticking was in the air again. A steady,\r\nrhythmic ticking, that got into the brain and beat time with the heart.\r\n\r\nOne minute.\r\n\r\nThe rocket rested on its launch, as though tightening its metallic\r\nmuscles and cords, to spring into the air like a wild frenzied terror,\r\nto cut through the sky, through space, to touch the Moon.\r\n\r\n"Thirty seconds," Charters said, his voice trembling.\r\n\r\nLampson closed his hands and his eyes.\r\n\r\n"Twenty seconds." Charters bent his head over his watch. 

His breathing\r\nshortened and he waited, tensed, crouched. 

"Ten. Five, four, three,\r\ntwo..."\r\n\r\nThe ground shook as though a chasm had split beneath its surface! There\r\nwas a streaking in the air. The rocket sped away and away.\r\n\r\n"Over!" said Charters, his face to the sky. "It\'s over!"\r\n\r\nLampson turned from the window and stood quietly, watching the floor.\r\nHis shoulders were limp, his hands still and quiet at his sides.\r\n\r\n"By God!" said Charters, whirling, slapping his palms together. "What\r\nan entirely immense thing!" He grinned widely and moved his feet as\r\nthough he were dancing.\r\n\r\n"Randall," said Lampson, his voice a lost, dead sound.\r\n\r\n"Randall, Randall," Charters mimicked. He moved about quickly, this\r\nway and that, waving his hands, grinning. "This is much greater than\r\nRandall!"\r\n\r\nLampson was silent while Charters cracked his hands together. "The\r\nMoon," Charters breathed. "The Moon!"\r\n\r\nThere was a loud shuffling outside the door then, and suddenly the door\r\nswung open and a wide-eyed man in the white coveralls stood, staring at\r\nCharters.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter?" said Charters, freezing.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t believe it," said the man. "I really can\'t believe it!"\r\n\r\n"What, man?" said Charters, moving toward the door.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Randall. He just climbed out of the rocket and walked away. Six\r\nseconds before it went up."\r\n\r\nCharters stopped, staring with wild eyes. His face colored. Rage choked\r\nhis voice.\r\n\r\n"WHY?" barked the man.\r\n\r\nLampson stood at the window, his eyes lighting. 

He smiled, then\r\nlaughed. And far away, a gleaming yellow-finned rocket drove up, up,\r\nfinding the path through space that would carry it, alone, past the\r\nMoon, to the Sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


But like the airy creature she was, Laloi ignored the\r\ncriticism and rippled zephyr-like through a clump of daffodils when they\r\ncompleted their descent.\r\n\r\n"So pretty," she sighed. She flung her incorporeal substance around each\r\nflower, absorbing their unified beauty of scent, sight, and feel. Buos\r\nshrilled himself into a column of wind to express his displeasure at her\r\nattitude.\r\n\r\n"Stupid, silly, shallow thing!" he said. "If the others only knew how\r\nyou behaved--"\r\n\r\n"And you\'ll be glad to tell them, of course," she said, extending her\r\nfingers of air into the roots of the wind-bent grass. She rolled across\r\nthe hill ecstatically, and Buos followed in grumbling billows of energy.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t carry tales," he replied, somewhat mortified. "But we\'re here\r\nas observers, and you insist upon making this world a plaything ..."\r\n\r\n"I love it," she said happily. "It\'s so warm and green."\r\n\r\nBuos whipped in front of her angrily. "This is an assignment," he\r\nsnapped, his emotion crackling the air about him. "We have a purpose\r\nhere."\r\n\r\n"Purpose!" she groaned, settling over a patch of crowded clover. "How\r\nmany centuries will this assignment last?"\r\n\r\n"This world is young," said Buos. "It will take time.

"\r\n\r\n"But how long?" she asked mournfully. "Our world will be shrivelled and\r\ndead before these people have the knowledge to rescue us. Why can\'t we\r\nspend our lives here ..."\r\n\r\n"And leave the others behind?" said Buos stiffly. "Selfish being," he\r\nsaid sadly. "This world cannot support one-fourth our number."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I know, I know," Laloi said. 

"I do not mean to say such things. I\r\nam twisted by my sorrow ..." As if to express her self-abnegation, she\r\ncorkscrewed out of the clover and into a thin spiral of\r\nnear-nothingness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Settle down, foolish one," said Buos, not unkindly. "I know your\r\nfeelings. 

Do you think I am not tormented as well, by the slow pace of\r\nthese Earth-things? Crude, barbaric beings, like children with the\r\nbuilding blocks of science. They have such a long way to go ..."\r\n\r\n"And so few _know_," said Laloi despairingly. "A handful of seeing\r\nminds, tens of millions of ignorant ones. Not even first\r\nprinciples--they\'re stupid, stupid!"\r\n\r\n"But they will learn," Buos said stubbornly. "That is historical fact.\r\nSomeday, they will know the true meanings of matter and light and\r\nenergy. Slowly, yes, slowly. But in terms of their growth, it will seem\r\nlike great speed to them ..."\r\n\r\n"And in terms of our world," said Laloi, spinning sadly over the ground,\r\n"they may be far too late ..."\r\n\r\n"No!" In his excitement, Buos forgot himself and entwined with the\r\nflowing form of the she-creature, and the result was a rending of the\r\nair that cracked like heat lightning over the field. "No," he repeated\r\nagain. 

"They must not be too late. They must learn. They must build from\r\nthe very ground, and then they must fly. And then their eyes must be\r\nlifted to the stars, and desire must extend them to all the universe ..."\r\n\r\n"It seems so hopeless--"\r\n\r\n"It cannot be! Our destiny is not extinction. They must come to us, in\r\nfleets of silver, and replant our soil, and send towers of green\r\nshooting into our sky, breathing out air."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes!" Laloi cried pitifully. "It will be that way, Buos. 

It will\r\nbe that way! That man-creature, we will begin with him ..."\r\n\r\nBuos floated earthward disconsolately. "He is a dreamer," he said\r\ncheerlessly. "His mind is good; he thinks of tomorrow; he is one of the\r\nknowing ones. But he cannot be moved, Laloi. His thoughts may fester and\r\ndie in the prison of his brain ..."\r\n\r\n"No, they will not! We have watched him. He understands much. He will\r\nhelp us!"\r\n\r\n"I have seen his like before," said Buos hopelessly. "He thinks and he\r\nworks, and his conclusions will die stillborn, for lack of a moving\r\nforce ..."\r\n\r\n"Then let us provide it, Buos. Let us move him!"\r\n\r\n"With what?" 

said the other disdainfully. "Arms of nothing? Hands of\r\nvacuum? A breeze against his cheek? A rustle of leaves? A meaningless\r\nwhistle in his ear?"\r\n\r\n"Let us try. Let us try! This empty watchfulness is destroying us. Let\r\nus move him, Buos. 

Come!"\r\n\r\nFaster than the sky-sweeping clouds they flew, over the gently swelling\r\nhills, over the yearning branches of the trees, over the calm blue\r\nwaters of the lakes. Swifter than the flight of birds they came,\r\nsearching for a thinking mind ...\r\n\r\nThey found him at last.\r\n\r\n"He knows, he knows," said Laloi. "Only now to say \'this is so because\'\r\nand \'this must happen when\'! Only to think--to understand--"\r\n\r\nThey hovered over his head, in a pandemonium of helplessness. 

They\r\nwhirled, and tumbled, and shrilly circled. And then to Laloi the\r\ninspiration came.\r\n\r\nThe apple, caught by a sudden gust of wind, twisted from the tenuous\r\nhold of the tree and fell to the ground.\r\n\r\nThe man, startled, picked it up.\r\n\r\nHe gazed at it, deep in thought.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ January 1957.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

"Boy, will I ever be\r\nglad to get off this cockeyed planet."\r\n\r\nGroverzb pushed at his spectacles, sniffed, and said, "Quite."\r\n\r\nThe big man said, "Ain\'t no native here over three feet tall. And they\r\ngot some crazy kind of communication. 

They don\'t talk."\r\n\r\nGroverzb said, "Quiet."\r\n\r\n"Uh?"\r\n\r\n"Precisely why I am here. I," said Groverzb, sniffing again, "loathe\r\nconversation."\r\n\r\n"Oh. Well." He left.\r\n\r\nAlone, Groverzb surveyed his realm. The house was the shell of what had\r\nformerly been a Little People apartment building. Ceilings, floors and\r\nwalls had been removed to form one large room. The tiny doors and\r\nwindows had been sealed, and a single window and door had been cut into\r\nthe shell for Groverzb\'s use. Crude, but serviceable.\r\n\r\nGroverzb walked to the window and looked down the slope. Little People\r\nbuildings dotted the landscape, and the people themselves scurried\r\nsilently about. Yes, thought Groverzb, it would do nicely. He had\r\nbrought an adequate food-tablet supply. He would finish, without the\r\ndistraction of voices, his beautiful concerto. He would return to Earth\r\nfamous and happy.\r\n\r\nArmed with paper and pencils, he went to the piano, having decided to\r\nenlarge upon the theme in the second movement. His mind knew exactly how\r\nthe passage should run, and he swiftly covered the paper with sharp,\r\nangular notes. Then he triumphantly lifted his hands and began to play\r\nwhat he had written.\r\n\r\nHe jerked back from the keyboard, his hair on end, his teeth, on edge,\r\nhis ears screaming with the mass of sounds he had produced. He looked at\r\nhis hands, peered at the score, adjusted his spectacles and tried again.\r\n\r\nI\'m tired, he thought, recoiling in horror from the racket. A food\r\ntablet and a nap will remedy the situation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke, Groverzb walked to the window, refreshed. A violet glow\r\nhad replaced the harsh yellow light of day. At the foot of the slope,\r\nthe Little People dashed to and fro, but no voice broke the peaceful\r\nquiet of the evening.\r\n\r\nWith a sigh of satisfaction, Groverzb went to the piano. Gently, he\r\nstruck the keys. Blatant, jumbled noise filled the room.\r\n\r\nBreathing hard, Groverzb rose and gingerly lifted the spinet\'s lid. No,\r\nnothing amiss there. Good felts, free hammers, solid sounding\r\nboard--must be out of tune.\r\n\r\nGroverzb closed the lid, sat down and struck a single note. A clear\r\ntone sang out. He moved chromatically up and down the scale. Definitely\r\nnot out of tune.\r\n\r\nHe shifted the score, glanced uneasily at the keys and began to play.\r\nDiscord immediately pierced his eardrums.\r\n\r\nHe clapped his hands over his ears and leaped wildly from the piano\r\nbench. The trip, he decided frantically. It must have affected my\r\nhearing.\r\n\r\nHe flung himself from the house and down the slope. The Little People\r\nscattered, staring. He charged into the administration building and\r\nclutched the lapels of a uniformed official.\r\n\r\n"A doctor!" he gasped. 

"Now! 

This minute!"\r\n\r\nThe official raised his eyebrows and removed Groverzb\'s hands with\r\ndistaste.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a little late in the day," he drawled, "but maybe the doc up on\r\nthe top floor--"\r\n\r\nGroverzb flew up the stairs and into the doctor\'s office. The doctor\'s\r\nface lit up.\r\n\r\n"A patient!" he exclaimed. 

"Capital! What seems to be the trouble? Food\r\npoisoning? Shouldn\'t eat the food here. Garbage. Appendix? Heart\r\nattack?"\r\n\r\n"Stop talking, you idiot, it\'s my ears!"\r\n\r\nObviously disappointed, the doctor nevertheless poked and peered at\r\nGroverzb\'s ears.\r\n\r\n"No," he said finally. "A trifle big, yes. 

But nothing wrong with them."\r\n\r\n"You\'re sure?"\r\n\r\n"Absolutely. A pity. 

I\'m getting a bit rusty."\r\n\r\nWith a groan, Groverzb staggered out of the building, back through town,\r\nand up the slope to his house. Seating himself firmly on the bench he\r\nbegan to play.\r\n\r\nHe shuddered. The noise was abominable.\r\n\r\nSuddenly his door burst open and a crowd of Little People rushed in.\r\nThey pulled him off the bench and slapped angrily at his hands. Then,\r\nwith cutters, they attacked the piano.\r\n\r\n"Here, stop that!" Groverzb screeched. 

"What do you think you\'re doing?"\r\n\r\nThe Little People pushed and dragged him out of the house, down the\r\nslope, through the town and into the launching bowl at the space-strip.\r\nThe launching agent took one look and yelled, "Get the interpreter! On\r\nthe double!

"\r\n\r\nThe interpreter ran up and whipped something from his pocket. It looked\r\nlike a miniature piano skeleton. He tripped a hammer. There was a faint\r\ntinkle. Instantly one of the Little People produced a single miniature\r\nhammer and tapped it rapidly against his skull. The interpreter tripped\r\nanother hammer. A second little one responded.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuddenly one of the Little People ran over and tripped all the\r\ninterpreter\'s hammers simultaneously. The Little People winced.\r\n\r\n"Oh," said the interpreter. "Well, it\'s their planet." He hustled\r\nGroverzb out to a freight ship that was warming up for takeoff.\r\n\r\n"Is everyone insane?" Groverzb croaked. "I demand to know what this is\r\nall about!"\r\n\r\nThe interpreter shoved Groverzb into the ship.\r\n\r\n"They say you talk too much!" he yelled, as he slammed the door.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

From outside the door he\r\ncaught a thought wave equivalent to a knock, and, glancing at the door,\r\nhe willed it to slide open.\r\n\r\nIt opened. 

"Enter, my friend," he said. He could have projected the idea\r\ntelepathically; but with only two persons present, speech was more\r\npolite.\r\n\r\nEjon Khee entered. "You are up late tonight, my leader," he said.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Khee. Within an hour the Earth rocket is due to land, and I wish\r\nto see it. Yes, I know, it will land a thousand miles away, if their\r\ncalculations are correct. Beyond the horizon. But if it lands even twice\r\nthat far the flash of the atomic explosion should be visible. And I have\r\nwaited long for first contact. For even though no Earthman will be on\r\nthat rocket, it will still be first contact--for them. Of course our\r\ntelepath teams have been reading their thoughts for many centuries,\r\nbut--this will be the first _physical_ contact between Mars and Earth."\r\n\r\nKhee made himself comfortable on one of the low chairs. 

"True," he said.\r\n"I have not followed recent reports too closely, though. Why are they\r\nusing an atomic warhead? I know they suppose our planet is uninhabited,\r\nbut still--"\r\n\r\n"They will watch the flash through their lunar telescopes and get\r\na--what do they call it?--a spectroscopic analysis. That will tell them\r\nmore than they know now (or think they know; much of it is erroneous)\r\nabout the atmosphere of our planet and the composition of its surface.\r\nIt is--call it a sighting shot, Khee. They\'ll be here in person within a\r\nfew oppositions. 

And then--"\r\n\r\nMars was holding out, waiting for Earth to come. What was left of Mars,\r\nthat is; this one small city of about nine hundred beings. The\r\ncivilization of Mars was older than that of Earth, but it was a dying\r\none. This was what remained of it: one city, nine hundred people. They\r\nwere waiting for Earth to make contact, for a selfish reason and for an\r\nunselfish one.\r\n\r\n\r\nMartian civilization had developed in a quite different direction from\r\nthat of Earth. It had developed no important knowledge of the physical\r\nsciences, no technology. But it had developed social sciences to the\r\npoint where there had not been a single crime, let alone a war, on\r\nMars for fifty thousand years. And it had developed fully the\r\nparapsychological sciences of the mind, which Earth was just beginning\r\nto discover.\r\n\r\nMars could teach Earth much. How to avoid crime and war to begin with.\r\nBeyond those simple things lay telepathy, telekinesis, empathy....\r\n\r\nAnd Earth would, Mars hoped, teach them something even more valuable to\r\nMars: how, by science and technology--which it was too late for Mars to\r\ndevelop now, even if they had the type of minds which would enable them\r\nto develop these things--to restore and rehabilitate a dying planet, so\r\nthat an otherwise dying race might live and multiply again.\r\n\r\nEach planet would gain greatly, and neither would lose.\r\n\r\nAnd tonight was the night when Earth would make its first sighting shot.\r\nIts next shot, a rocket containing Earthmen, or at least an Earthman,\r\nwould be at the next opposition, two Earth years, or roughly four\r\nMartian years, hence. The Martians knew this, because their teams of\r\ntelepaths were able to catch at least some of the thoughts of Earthmen,\r\nenough to know their plans. Unfortunately, at that distance, the\r\nconnection was one-way. Mars could not ask Earth to hurry its program.\r\nOr tell Earth scientists the facts about Mars\' composition and\r\natmosphere which would have made this preliminary shot unnecessary.\r\n\r\nTonight Ry, the leader (as nearly as the Martian word can be\r\ntranslated), and Khee, his administrative assistant and closest friend,\r\nsat and meditated together until the time was near. Then they drank a\r\ntoast to the future--in a beverage based on menthol, which had the same\r\neffect on Martians as alcohol on Earthmen--and climbed to the roof of\r\nthe building in which they had been sitting. They watched toward the\r\nnorth, where the rocket should land. The stars shone brilliantly and\r\nunwinkingly through the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Observatory No. 1 on Earth\'s moon, Rog Everett, his eye at the\r\neyepiece of the spotter scope, said triumphantly, "Thar she blew,\r\nWillie. And now, as soon as the films are developed, we\'ll know the\r\nscore on that old planet Mars." He straightened up--there\'d be no more\r\nto see now--and he and Willie Sanger shook hands solemnly. It was an\r\nhistorical occasion.\r\n\r\n"Hope it didn\'t kill anybody. 

Any Martians, that is. Rog, did it hit\r\ndead center in Syrtis Major?"\r\n\r\n"Near as matters. I\'d say it was maybe a thousand miles off, to the\r\nsouth. And that\'s damn close on a fifty-million-mile shot. Willie, do\r\nyou really think there are any Martians?

"\r\n\r\nWillie thought a second and then said, "No."\r\n\r\nHe was right.\r\n\r\n\r\n  --FREDRIC BROWN\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n


Martin Cole."\r\n\r\n"Your profession?"\r\n\r\n"A very important one. I am a literary agent specializing in science\r\nfiction. 

I sell the work of various authors to magazine and book\r\npublishers."\r\n\r\nThe Coroner paused to study Cole; to ponder the thin, mirthless smile.\r\nThe Coroner said, "Mr. Cole, this inquest has been called to look into\r\nthe death of one Sanford Smith, who was found near your home with a gun\r\nin his hand and a bullet in his brain. The theory of suicide has been--"\r\n\r\n"--rather hard to rationalize?"\r\n\r\nThe Coroner blinked. "You could put it that way.

"\r\n\r\n"I would put it even stronger. The theory is obviously ridiculous. It\r\nwas a weak cover-up. 

The best I could do under the circumstances."\r\n\r\n"You are saying that you killed Sanford Smith?"\r\n\r\n"Of course."\r\n\r\nThe Coroner glanced at his six-man jury, at the two police officers, at\r\nthe scattering of spectators. They all seemed stunned. Even the reporter\r\nsent to cover the hearing made no move toward the telephone. The Coroner\r\ncould think of only the obvious question: "Why did you kill him?"\r\n\r\n"He was dangerous to us.

"\r\n\r\n"Whom do you mean by _us_?"\r\n\r\n"We Martians, who plan to take over your world."\r\n\r\nThe Coroner was disappointed. A lunatic. But a lunatic can murder. Best\r\nto proceed, the Coroner thought. "I was not aware that we have Martians\r\nto contend with."\r\n\r\n"If I\'d had the right weapon to use on Smith, you wouldn\'t be aware of\r\nit now. We still exercise caution."\r\n\r\nThe Coroner felt a certain pity. "Why did you kill Smith?"\r\n\r\n"We Martians have found science-fiction writers to be our greatest\r\ndanger. Through the medium of imaginative fiction, such writers have\r\nmore than once revealed our plans. If the public suddenly realized\r\nthat--"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Coroner broke in. "You killed Smith because he revealed something in\r\nhis writings?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. He refused to take my word that it was unsalable. He threatened to\r\nsubmit it direct. 

It was vital material."\r\n\r\n"But there are many other such writers. You can\'t control--"\r\n\r\n"We control ninety percent of the output. We have concentrated on the\r\nfield and all of the science-fiction agencies are in our hands. This\r\ncontrol was imperative.

"\r\n\r\n"I see." The Coroner spoke in the gentle tones one uses with the insane.\r\n"Any writing dangerous to your cause is deleted or changed by the\r\nagents."\r\n\r\n"Not exactly. The agent usually persuades the writer to make any such\r\nchanges, as the agent is considered an authority on what will or will\r\nnot sell."\r\n\r\n"The writers always agree?"\r\n\r\n"Not always. If stubbornness is encountered, the agent merely shelves\r\nthe manuscript and tells the writer it has been repeatedly rejected."\r\n\r\nThe Coroner glanced at the two policemen. Both were obviously puzzled.\r\nThey returned the Coroner\'s look, apparently ready to move on his order.\r\n\r\nThe thin, mirthless smile was still on Cole\'s lips. Maniacal violence\r\ncould lie just behind it. Possibly Cole was armed. Better to play for\r\ntime--try to quiet the madness within. The Coroner continued speaking.\r\n"You Martians have infiltrated other fields also?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. 

We are in government, industry, education. We are everywhere.\r\nWe have, of course, concentrated mainly upon the ranks of labor and in\r\nthe masses of ordinary, everyday people. It is from these sources that\r\nwe will draw our shock troops when the time comes."\r\n\r\n"That time will be--?

"\r\n\r\n"Soon, very soon."\r\n\r\nThe Coroner could not forebear a smile. "You find the science-fiction\r\nwriters more dangerous than the true scientists?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. The scientific mind tends to reject anything science\r\ndisproves." There was now a mocking edge to Cole\'s voice. "Science can\r\neasily prove we do not exist."\r\n\r\n"But the science-fiction writer?"\r\n\r\n"The danger from the imaginative mind cannot be overestimated."\r\n\r\nThe Coroner knew he must soon order the officers to lay hands upon this\r\nmadman. He regretted his own lack of experience with such situations. 

He\r\ntried to put a soothing, confidential note into his voice. "You said a\r\nmoment ago that if you\'d had the right kind of weapon to use on Smith--"\r\n\r\nCole reached into his pocket and brought out what appeared to be a\r\nfountain pen. "This. It kills instantly and leaves no mark whatever.\r\nHeart failure is invariably stated as the cause of death."\r\n\r\nThe Coroner felt better. Obviously, Cole was not armed. As the Coroner\r\nraised a hand to signal the officers, Cole said, "You understand, of\r\ncourse, that I can\'t let you live."\r\n\r\n"Take this man into custody."\r\n\r\nThe police officers did not move. The Coroner turned on them sharply.\r\nThey were smiling. Cole pointed the fountain pen. The Coroner felt a\r\nsharp chill on his flesh. He looked at the jury, at the newspaperman,\r\nthe spectators. They were all smiling cold, thin, terrible smiles....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA short time later, the newspaperman phoned in his story.

And you\'re allowed\r\n only one mistake--your last!\r\n\r\n\r\nMy radar picked him up when he was about five hundred miles to my\r\nnorth-northeast and about forty-five miles above me. I switched the\r\nvelocity calculator on him as fast as I could reach it.\r\n\r\nThe enemy ship was doing sixteen, possibly even sixteen and a half. I\r\ntook the chance that it was most likely an Ivar Interceptor, at that\r\nspeed, and punched out a temporary evasion pattern with my right hand\r\nwhile with my left I snapped an Ivar K-12 card into my calculator along\r\nwith his estimated speed, altitude and distance. It wasn\'t much to go on\r\nas yet but he couldn\'t have much more on me, if as much; inwardly I\r\ncongratulated myself on the quick identification I\'d managed.\r\n\r\nHe was near enough now for my visor screen to pick him up. At least he\r\nwas alone, that was something. My nearest squadron mate was a good\r\nminute and a half away. It might as well have been a century.\r\n\r\nNow, this is what is always hard to get over to a civilian; the time\r\nelement. Understand, it will take me a while to tell this but it all\r\ntook less than sixty seconds to happen.\r\n\r\nHe had guessed my evasion pattern already--either guessed it or had some\r\nnew calculator that was far and beyond anything our techs were turning\r\nout. I could tell he\'d anticipated me by the Bong-Sonic roll he slipped\r\ninto.\r\n\r\nI quickly punched up a new pattern based on the little material I had in\r\nthe calculator. At least I\'d caught the roll. I punched that up,\r\nhurriedly, slipped it into the IBM, guessed that his next probability\r\nwas a pass, took a chance on that and punched it in.\r\n\r\nI was wrong there. He didn\'t take his opportunity for a front-on pass.\r\nHe was either newly out of their academy or insultingly confident. My\r\nlips felt tight as I canceled the frontal pass card, punched up two more\r\nto take its place.\r\n\r\nThe base supervisor cut in on the phone. "It looks like old Dmitri\r\nhimself, Jerry, and he\'s flying one of the new K-12a models. Go get him,\r\nboy!

"\r\n\r\nI felt like snapping back. He knew better than to break in on me at a\r\ntime like this. I opened my mouth, then shut it again. Did he say K-12a?\r\n_Did he say K-12a?_\r\n\r\nI squinted at the visor screen. The high tail, the canopy, the oddly\r\nshaped wing tanks.\r\n\r\nI\'d gone off on the identification!\r\n\r\nI slapped another evasion pattern into the controls, a standard set, I\r\nhad no time to punch up an improvisation. But he was on me like a wasp.\r\nI rejected it, threw in another set. 

Reject. Another!\r\n\r\nEven as I worked, I kicked the release on my own calculator, dumped it\r\nall, selected like a flash an Ivar K-12a card, and what other\r\nestimations I could make while my mind was busy with the full-time job\r\nof evasion.\r\n\r\nMy hands were still making the motions, my fingers were flicking here,\r\nthere, my feet touching here, there. But my heart wasn\'t in it.\r\n\r\nHe already had such an advantage that it was all I could do to keep him\r\nin my visor screen. 

He was to the left, to the right. I got him for a\r\nfull quarter-second in the wires, but the auto gunner was too far\r\nbehind, much too far.\r\n\r\nHis own guns flicked red.\r\n\r\nI punched half a dozen buttons, slapped levers, tried to scoot for home.\r\n\r\nTo the left of my cubicle two lights went yellowish and at the same time\r\nmy visor screen went dead. I was blind.\r\n\r\nI sank back in my chair, helpless.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe speed indicator wavered, went slowly, deliberately to zero; the\r\naltimeter died; the fuel gauge. Finally, even the dozen or so\r\ntrouble-indicators here, there, everywhere about the craft. Fifteen\r\nmillion dollars worth of warcraft was being shot into wreckage.\r\n\r\nI sat there for a long, long minute and took it.\r\n\r\nThen I got to my feet and wearily opened the door of my cubicle.\r\nSergeant Walters and the rest of the maintenance crew were standing\r\nthere. They could read in my face what had happened.\r\n\r\nThe sergeant began, "Captain, I ..."\r\n\r\nI grunted at him. "Never mind, Sergeant. It had nothing to do with the\r\nship\'s condition." I turned to head for the operations office.\r\n\r\nBill Dickson strolled over from the direction of his own cubicle.\r\n"Somebody said you just had a scramble with old Dmitri himself."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," I said. 

"I don\'t know if it was him or not. Maybe some\r\nof you guys can tell a man\'s flying but I can\'t."\r\n\r\nHe grinned at me. "Shot you down, eh?

"\r\n\r\nI didn\'t answer.\r\n\r\nHe said, "What happened?"\r\n\r\n"I thought it was an Ivar K-12, and I put that card in my calculator.\r\nTurned out it was one of those new models, K-12a. That was enough, of\r\ncourse.

"\r\n\r\nBill grinned at me again. "That\'s two this week. That flak got you near\r\nthat bridge and now you get ..."\r\n\r\n"Shut up," I told him.\r\n\r\nHe counted up on his fingers elaborately. "The way I figure it, you lose\r\none more ship and you\'re an enemy ace."\r\n\r\nHe was irrepressible. "Damn it," I said, "will you cut it out! I\'ve got\r\nenough to worry about without you working me over. This means I\'ll have\r\nto spend another half an hour in operations going over the fight. And\r\nthat means I\'ll be late for dinner again. And you know Molly."\r\n\r\nBill sobered. 

"Gee," he said, "I\'m sorry. War is hell, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Imagination Stories of Science and\r\n    Fantasy_ July 1953.

Certainly some of them have tried. This man\r\n    succeeded._\r\n\r\n\r\n     rex\r\n      ex\r\n machina\r\n\r\n _by ... Frederic Max_\r\n\r\n\r\n One final lesson--a dying man\'s last letter to his\r\n only son that completes the young man\'s education.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SON:--\r\n\r\nThe doctors have left and I am told that in a few hours I shall die. In\r\nmy lifetime the world has progressed from the chaotic turmoil of the\r\nearly Atomic era to the peacefulness and tranquility of our present age,\r\nand I die content.\r\n\r\nFor ten years I have instructed you in all that you will need for the\r\nfuture. 

One final lesson remains to be taught.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the wall of my bedchamber hangs a citation "from a grateful\r\ngovernment for services too secret to be herein set forth." In past\r\nyears you have asked me repeatedly about this citation, but each time I\r\nhave taken pains to avoid a direct answer. Now it is proper that you\r\nshould know.\r\n\r\nForty years ago I was an obscure Army captain stationed at the Armed\r\nForces Language School in Monterey, California. I had at that time just\r\ncompleted a tour of duty in Korea, a minor skirmish of that era, and\r\ndespite an excellent reputation for resourcefulness, I had drawn\r\nMonterey as my next assignment. An aptitude for foreign languages had\r\nled to an instructorship in the Russian department with additional\r\nduties instructing in the Slavic tongues.\r\n\r\nMy life was pleasant and uneventful, and it was with mixed emotions that\r\nI received orders to report to Washington for a new duty assignment.\r\nThe chain of events which precipitated those orders were to change the\r\nworld....\r\n\r\nFor while you and I were playing on the lawn of our Monterey home, an\r\nunknown Hungarian physicist working under Russian supervision had made a\r\nstartling discovery. Within a matter of days alarming rumors of his work\r\nreached Washington. Our embassies in Moscow and Belgrade reported\r\nfurious activity in the field of psychic research and large-scale\r\nexperiments in mass hypnosis. Four of us were selected to investigate\r\nthe rumors. 

Before we could commence our undertaking, word reached\r\nWashington that the rumors were now actualities. A device capable of the\r\nmass hypnosis of great segments of the world\'s population was rapidly\r\nreaching perfection.\r\n\r\nAfter three months of intensive grooming in the fields of physics and\r\npsychology, we four agents set out individually with orders to track\r\ndown and destroy both the scientist and his machine. I never saw the\r\nother three again....\r\n\r\nDuring the three months of schooling, other members of our vast\r\nintelligence organization had been engaged in laying the groundwork for\r\nour efforts. 

In December 1955, I slipped into Russia and took the place\r\nof a government official who felt that Western civilization offered\r\ngreater reimbursement than Soviet Communism.\r\n\r\nI entered into my new role with trepidation, but my fears were\r\nunfounded. Thanks to a remarkable resemblance (which was the original\r\nreason for my selection) and also due to a most thorough briefing, I\r\nfound myself making the substitution with ease. I pride myself on the\r\nfact that by diligent application I was able to increase my worth to the\r\nRussian government to the extent that I was shortly able to secure my\r\ntransfer to the psychological warfare section of the secret police. From\r\nthere it was a simple procedure to have myself assigned to what was\r\nknown as "Project Parchak."\r\n\r\nThe device was in its final stage of development; only the problem of\r\nincreasing its effective range remained to be solved. Three weeks after\r\nmy assignment to the project, its successful conclusion was\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nIn June 1956, the Russian government ordered me to a small house on the\r\noutskirts of Braila, Hungary, where I was to attend a private showing of\r\nthe device. By design, I arrived one day early and made my way to the\r\nlaboratory immediately. 

Dr. Michael Parchak, the inventor, stood facing\r\nme as I entered. On a table between us lay a small complicated mechanism\r\nresembling a radio transmitter. But it was infinitely more than that.\r\nThe device was a thought generator capable of hypnotizing every thinking\r\ncreature on the face of the earth. The power of infinite goodness or\r\nevil which the machine embodied was terrifying to consider.\r\n\r\nI listened to Parchak\'s boasting with revulsion. Although he had the\r\nability to work for the ultimate good of mankind, this creature\r\nintended, instead, to use his newly found power for selfish\r\naggrandizement.\r\n\r\nI drew him out, let him explain the inner workings of his device--and\r\nkilled him. 

My orders were to destroy the machine. I disobeyed them.\r\nUtilizing the machine to make good my escape, I left Hungary and\r\nreturned to the United States. The citation which you have seen was only\r\none of the many honors which were bestowed upon me.\r\n\r\nA few weeks later I resigned my commission and retired to a country\r\nhideaway to experiment further with the device I was supposed to have\r\ndestroyed. The peace and tranquility in which we of the earth now live\r\nmarked the successful culmination of my experiments.\r\n\r\nYou will find the machine walled up in the North alcove of my\r\nbedchamber.\r\n\r\nYour education is now complete my son, use it well. Be kind to our slave\r\npeoples, the world is yours.\r\n\r\nYour affectionate father,\r\n\r\n                                                  FRANCIS I\r\n                                                  EMPEROR OF THE EARTH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ May 1954.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

Mort Eddison, his best friend,\r\nlooked at him reprovingly; the class had been in session for almost\r\nfifteen minutes, and one just didn\'t come late to Professor Carner\'s\r\nlecture. Especially on the first day.\r\n\r\nEddie breathed easier as he saw that Professor Carner\'s back was to the\r\nclass as he completed a diagram on the blackboard.\r\n\r\n"Now then," Carner said. "Suppose you were writing about the--ah--the\r\nVenusian Threngener, which, as you know, has three legs. How would you\r\ndescribe it?"\r\n\r\nOne of the students raised his hand. "I\'d call it a three-legged\r\nmonstrosity, spawned in the deepest hells of--"\r\n\r\n"No," Carner said quietly. "That kind of writing might have been all\r\nright in the earliest days of our subject.

Now,\r\nsomeone else?"\r\n\r\nMort raised his hand, threw a glance at Eddie, and said: "How about,\r\n\'this tri-pedal blob of orange protoplasm, octopus like in its\r\ngropings--\'"\r\n\r\n"That\'s better," Carner said. "Tri-pedal is very nice, very exact. But\r\nmust you compare it to an octopus?

"\r\n\r\n"Why not?" Mort asked.\r\n\r\n"An octopus," the professor said, "is a well-known form of Earth\r\nlife. It inspires no terror, no wonder. 

You might better compare the\r\nThrengener to _another_ strange monster; a Callistan Eddel-splayer, for\r\nexample." He smiled winningly at the class.\r\n\r\nEddie frowned and scratched his blonde crewcut. He had liked it better\r\nthe first way. But Carner should know, of course. He was one of the\r\nbest-known writers in the entire field, and he had done the college a\r\nfavor by agreeing to teach the course. Eddie remembered reading some\r\nof Carner\'s stuff. It had scared the living daylights out of him when\r\nhe was younger. That description of Saturnian brains immobilizing\r\nEarth-confederation ships, for example. That had been a great yarn.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe trouble is, Eddie thought, I\'m just not interested. He had had\r\nserious doubts about this course. Actually, he had signed up only\r\nbecause Mort had insisted.\r\n\r\n"Any questions at this point?" Carner asked. One of the students--a\r\nserious-looking fellow wearing black horn-rimmed glasses--raised his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n"Suppose," he asked, "suppose you were writing a story speculating on\r\nan interstellar combine formed with the purpose of taking over Earth?\r\nWould it be permissible, for greater contrast, to make Earth\'s enemies\r\nblack-hearted villains?"\r\n\r\nA political thinker, Eddie thought with a sneer. 

He glanced hopefully\r\nat the clock.\r\n\r\n"It wouldn\'t be advisable." Carner sat casually on the corner of his\r\ndesk. "Make them human also; show the reader that these aliens--whether\r\nthey have one head or five--have emotions understandable to them. Let\r\nthem feel joy and pain. Show them as being misguided. Pure evil in your\r\ncharacters has gone out of fashion."\r\n\r\n"But could I make their leader pure evil?" the young man asked, busily\r\njotting down everything Carner had said.\r\n\r\n"I suppose so," Carner said thoughtfully. "But give him motivations\r\nalso. By the way, in dealing with that sort of story--the panoramic\r\nkind--remember not to oversimplify the aliens\' problems. If they amass\r\nan army of twenty million, all have to be fed. If the rulers of fifty\r\nscattered star systems meet in conclave, remember that different star\r\nsystems have different languages, and different races have different\r\nnervous systems. Bear in mind also, that there would be little logical\r\nreason for attacking earth; the galaxy is filled with so many stars and\r\nplanets, what is the necessity of fighting for one?"\r\n\r\nThe horn-rimmed fellow nodded dubiously, writing his notes with\r\ntremendous speed. Eddie stifled a yawn. He preferred to think of his\r\nvillains as pure unadulterated evil; it made characterization so much\r\neasier. And he was getting tremendously bored.\r\n\r\nCarner answered questions for the next half hour. He told them not to\r\ndescribe Venus as a \'jungle-choked green hell,\' never, never to call\r\nthe moon \'pock-marked,\' \'small-pox pitted,\' or \'scarred from centuries\r\nof meteoric bombardment.\'\r\n\r\n"All this has been said," he explained. "Millions of times. _Do not_\r\nuse cliches."\r\n\r\nHe went on to explain that the red spot of Jupiter need not be called a\r\nmalevolent red eye, that Saturn\'s rings don\'t necessarily resemble a\r\nhalo, and that the inhabitants of Venus are not Venetians.\r\n\r\n"All common errors," he said. "I want a thousand words from each of you\r\nnext time. I suggest that you choose a planet and write a fresh study\r\nof it, avoiding with care all the cliches I mentioned. Class dismissed.

"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Well, whadja think?" Mort asked Eddie in the hall. "Isn\'t he great? I\r\nmean, he really _knows_!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m dropping out of the class," Eddie said, making up his mind.\r\n\r\n"What! Why?"\r\n\r\n"Well," Eddie said, "There\'s no reason why I shouldn\'t call the red\r\nspot on Jupiter a malevolent red eye. I put that in a story last month,\r\nand it sounded good. 

And that Venetian Threngener--I think it\'s a\r\n_monstrosity_, and I\'m going to write about it that way."\r\n\r\nHe paused, and his face hardened with conviction.\r\n\r\n"But the real reason--well, I\'m just not interested in journalism. I\'m\r\ndropping Carner\'s course in fact feature-article writing, because I\r\nwant to write fiction!"\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n

The blueprint can be found in the next few pages; and as\r\n    the soldier in the story says, our only hope is to keep a sense of\r\n    humor!_\r\n\r\n\r\nMe? I\'m looking for my outfit. Got cut off in that Holland Tunnel\r\nattack. Mind if I sit down with you guys a while? Thanks. Coffee? Damn!\r\nThis is heaven. Ain\'t seen a cup of coffee in a year.\r\n\r\nWhat? You said it! This sure is a hell of a war. Tough on a guy\'s feet.\r\nYeah, that\'s right. Holland Tunnel skirmish. Where the Ruskies used that\r\nnew gun. Uhuh. 

God! It was awful. Guys popping off all around a guy and\r\nhim not knowing why. No sense to it. 

No noise. No wound. Just popping\r\noff.\r\n\r\nThat\'s the trouble with this war. It won\'t settle down to a routine.\r\nAlways something new. What the hell chance has a guy got to figure\r\nthings out? And I tell you them Ruskies are coming up with new weapons\r\njust as fast as we are. Enough to make your hair stand on end.\r\n\r\nSugar? 

Christ, yes! Ain\'t seen sugar for a year. You see, it\'s like\r\nthis: we were bottled up in the pits around the Tunnel for seven damn\r\ndays. It was like nothing you ever saw before. 

Oops--sorry. Didn\'t mean\r\nto splash you. I was laughing about something that happened there--to a\r\nguy. Maybe you guys would get a kick out of it. After all, we got to\r\nkeep our sense of humor.\r\n\r\nYou see, there was me and a Kentucky kid named Stillwell in this pit--a\r\npretty big pit with lots of room--and we were all alone. This Stillwell\r\nwas a nice kid--green and lonesome and it\'s pretty sad, really, but\r\nthere\'s a yak in it, and--as I say--we got to keep a sense of humor.\r\n\r\nWell, this Stillwell--a really green kid--is unhappy and just plain\r\ndrooling for his gal back home. He talks about his mother, of course,\r\nand his old man, but it\'s the girl that\'s really on his mind as you guys\r\ncan plainly understand.\r\n\r\nHe\'s seeing her every place--like spots in front of his eyes--nice spots\r\ndoing things to him, when this Ruskie babe shows up.\r\n\r\nMy gun came up without any orders from me just as she poked her puss\r\nover the edge of the pit, and--huh? Oh, thank you kindly. It sure tastes\r\ngood but I don\'t want to short you guys. Thank you kindly.\r\n\r\nWell, as I was saying, this Ruskie babe pokes her nose over the edge of\r\nthe pit and Stillwell dives and knocks down my gun. He says, "You\r\nson-of-a-bitch!" Just like that. Wild and desperate, like you\'d say to a\r\nguy if the guy was just kicking over the last jug of water on a desert\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nIt would have been long enough for her to kill us if I hadn\'t had good\r\nreflexes. Even then, all I had time to do was knock the pistol out of\r\nher hand and drag her into the pit.\r\n\r\nWith her play bollixed, she was confused and bewildered. She ain\'t a\r\nfighter, and she sits back against the wall staring at us dead pan with\r\nbig expressionless eyes. She\'s a plenty pretty babe and I could see\r\nexactly what had happened as far as Stillwell was concerned. His spots\r\nhad come to life in very adequate form so to speak.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nStillwell goes over and sits down beside her and I\'m very much on the\r\nalert, because I know where his courage comes from. But I decide it\'s\r\nall right, because I see the babe is not belligerent, just confused kind\r\nof. And friendly.\r\n\r\nAnd willing. Kind of a whipped-little-dog willing, and man oh man! She\r\nwas sure what Stillwell needed.\r\n\r\nThey kind of went together like a hand and a glove--natural-like. And\r\nit followed--pretty natural--that when Stillwell got up and led her\r\naround a wing of the pit, out of sight, she went willing--like that same\r\nlittle dog.\r\n\r\nUhuh. No, you guys. 

Two\'s enough. 

I wouldn\'t rob you. Well, okay, and\r\nthanks kindly.\r\n\r\nWell, there I was, all alone, but happy for Stillwell, cause I know it\'s\r\nwhat the kid needs, and in spots like that what difference does it make?\r\nYank--Ruskie--Mongolian--as long as she\'s willing.\r\n\r\nThen, you guys, Stillwell comes back out--wall-eyed--real\r\nwall-eyed--like being hit but not knocked out and still walking. I know\r\nwhat it is--some kind of shock. I get up and walk over and take a look\r\nat the babe where he\'d left her--and I bust out laughing. I told you\r\nguys there was a yak in this. I laughed like a fool--it was that funny.\r\nAs much as I had time to, before Stillwell cracked. It was enough to\r\ncrack him--the little thing that pushes a guy over the edge.\r\n\r\nHe lets out a yell and screams, "For crisake! For crisake! Nothing but a\r\nbucket of bolts! Nothing but a couple of plastic lumps--"\r\n\r\nThat was when I hit him. 

I had to. He was for the birds, Stillwell was.\r\nAn hour later we got relieved and a couple of medicos carried him away\r\nstrapped to a stretcher--gone like a kite.\r\n\r\nThey took the robot too, and its clothes, but they forgot the brassiere,\r\nso I took it and I been carrying it ever since, but I\'ll leave it with\r\nyou guys if you want--for the coffee. Might make you think about home.\r\nAfter all, like the man says, we got to keep our sense of humor.\r\n\r\nWell, so long, you guys--and thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ April-May 1953.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

Perhaps they will carry folks\r\n    down the highways at ninety miles an hour in perfect safety. But\r\n    picking up a hitch-hiker will still be as dangerous as it is today._\r\n\r\n HARD\r\n GUY\r\n\r\n By H. B. CARLETON\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was standing at the side of the glassite super-highway, his arm\r\nhalf-raised, thumb pointed in the same direction as that of the\r\napproaching rocket car. Ordinarily Frederick Marden would have passed a\r\nhitch-hiker without stopping, but there was something in the bearing and\r\nappearance of this one that caused him to apply his brakes.\r\n\r\nMarden opened the door next to the vacant seat beside him.\r\n\r\n"Going my way?" he asked.\r\n\r\nA pair of steady, unsmiling blue eyes looked him over. 

"Yeah.

"\r\n\r\n"All right, then. Hop in."\r\n\r\nThe hitch-hiker took his time. He slid into the seat with casual\r\ndeliberateness and slammed the car door shut. The rocket car got under\r\nway once more.\r\n\r\nThey rode in silence for half a mile or so. Finally Marden glanced\r\nquestioningly at his companion\'s expressionless profile.\r\n\r\n"Where are you headed for?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Dentonville." He spoke from the corner of his mouth, without turning\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. 

That\'s the next town, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Yeah."\r\n\r\nNot very communicative, reflected Marden, noticing the rather ragged\r\ncondition of the other\'s celo-lex clothing.\r\n\r\n"Have much trouble getting rides?"\r\n\r\nThe passenger turned his head, his blue eyes without emotion.\r\n\r\n"Yeah. Most guys are leery about pickin\' up hitch-hikers. Scared they\'ll\r\nget robbed."\r\n\r\nMarden pursed his lips, nodded.\r\n\r\n"Something to that, all right. I\'m usually pretty careful myself; but I\r\nfigured you looked okay."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t always tell by looks," was the calm reply. "\'Course us guys\r\nmostly pick out some guy with a swell atomic-mobile if we\'re goin\' to\r\npull a stick-up. When we see a old heap like this one there\'s usually\r\nnot enough dough to make it pay."\r\n\r\nMarden felt his jaw drop.\r\n\r\n"Say, you sound, like you go in for that sort of thing! I\'m telling you\r\nright now, I haven\'t enough cash on me to make it worth your while. I\'m\r\njust a salesman, trying to get along."\r\n\r\n"You got nothin\' to worry about," his passenger assured him. "Stick-ups\r\nain\'t my racket."\r\n\r\nAn audible sigh of relief escaped Marden.\r\n\r\n"I\'m certainly glad to hear that! What is your--er--racket, anyway?"\r\n\r\nThe blue eyes frosted over.\r\n\r\n"Look, chum, sometimes it ain\'t exactly healthy to ask questions like\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"Pardon me," Marden said hastily. "I didn\'t mean anything. It\'s none of\r\nmy business, of course."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe calm eyes flicked over his contrite expression.\r\n\r\n"Skip it, pal. You look like a right guy. I\'ll put you next to\r\nsomethin\'. Only keep your lip buttoned, see?

"\r\n\r\n"Oh, absolutely."\r\n\r\n"I\'m Mike Eagen--head of the Strato Rovers."\r\n\r\n"No!" Marden was plainly awed. "The Strato Rovers, eh? I\'ve heard of\r\nthem, all right.

"\r\n\r\nThe other nodded complacently.\r\n\r\n"Yeah. We\'re about the toughest mob this side of Mars. We don\'t bother\r\nhonest people, though. We get ours from the crooks and racketeers. They\r\ncan\'t squeal to the Interplanetary Police."\r\n\r\n"There\'s a lot in what you say," agreed Marden. "And of course that puts\r\nyour ... mob in the Robin Hood class."\r\n\r\n"Robin Hood--nuts! That guy was a dope! 

Runnin\' around with bows and\r\narrows. Why, we got a mystery ray that paralyzes anybody that starts up\r\nwith us. They\'re all right when it wears off, but by that time we get\r\naway."\r\n\r\nMarden was properly impressed.\r\n\r\n"A mystery ray! With a weapon like that, you should be able to walk into\r\na bank and clean it out without any trouble."\r\n\r\nHis passenger\'s lips curled.\r\n\r\n"I told you, we don\'t bother honest people. We even help the S.P.\r\nsometimes. 

Right now we\'re workin\' with the Earth-Mars G-men in roundin\'\r\nup a gang of fifth-columnists that are plannin\' on takin\' over the\r\ngov\'ment. They\'re led by the Black Hornet. This Black Hornet goes around\r\npretendin\' like he\'s a big business man, but he\'s really a internatural\r\nspy."\r\n\r\n"A--what?"\r\n\r\n"A internatural spy," repeated Marden\'s companion, shortly. "The E-M\r\nG-men say he\'s the most dangerous man in the country. But he won\'t last\r\nlong with the Strato Rovers on his trail."\r\n\r\nMarden nodded.\r\n\r\n"I can believe that. Tell me, Eagen, what are you doing out here around\r\na small Earth town like Dentonville?"\r\n\r\n"The gov\'ment\'s buildin\' some kind of a ammunition place near here, and\r\nI understand the Black Hornet\'s figurin\' on wreckin\' everything. \'Course\r\nhe won\'t get away with it."\r\n\r\nScattered plasticade houses on either side of the road indicated they\r\nhad reached the outskirts of Dentonville. Mike Eagen pointed ahead to a\r\nsmall white house set back among a cluster of trees.\r\n\r\n"There\'s where I\'m holed up. Drop me off in front."\r\n\r\nA young woman in a faded blue satin-glass house-dress was standing at\r\nthe gate of the white picket fence. She watched in silence as the\r\npassenger stepped from the rocket car and lifted his hand to the driver\r\nin careless farewell.\r\n\r\n"Thanks for the lift, chum," said Mike Eagen.\r\n\r\n"Not at all," replied Marden. "Glad to have been of service to Mike\r\nEagen."\r\n\r\nThe woman smiled to him.\r\n\r\n"He\'s told you his name, I see."\r\n\r\nMarden lifted his hat.\r\n\r\n"Indeed he has."\r\n\r\n"Michael is all right," she said. "I do think, though, that he reads too\r\nmany Buck Gordon Interplanetary comic books for a boy of eleven."\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ April 1956 and was\r\n    first published in _Amazing Stories_ November 1942.

"Just tell me what to do\r\nand I\'ll do it."\r\n\r\n"Do you love me?" she looked up at me.\r\n\r\n"You know I do."\r\n\r\n"Say it."\r\n\r\n"I love you."\r\n\r\n"Never stop saying that." She put up her face and I kissed her. A\r\nlong hard kiss. She broke away. "You\'ll be in back in the racer. Just\r\ncrouch low. As soon as we\'re away from the spaceway you hit him with\r\nthe wrench. It has to be quick and sure. Then we carry him up to the\r\napartment and drop him out the window."\r\n\r\nI shuddered a little as she talked. She was so calm about the whole\r\nthing.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll have plenty of time to get out. It\'ll be listed as a suicide.\r\nHe\'s been sick for a long time. His doctor will testify to that. He was\r\nso sick and worried he jumped to his death."\r\n\r\nShe stared at me hard. "Is it all clear?"\r\n\r\n"Yes." I looked at her. Her long blond hair, her oval face, the slim\r\nwhite column that was her throat. "It\'s all clear. Like glass."\r\n\r\nI poured myself a drink. I needed it. I was going to need a lot more.\r\n\r\n"We won\'t be able to see each other for a long time," she said. She\r\nwatched me drink. "We don\'t want to give our friends something to talk\r\nabout."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t like not seeing you."\r\n\r\nShe patted my face. I put down my drink, caged her slender hand in\r\nmine, and kissed her wrist. I saw the light blue veins criss-crossing\r\nunder the delicate skin.\r\n\r\nI brought her close to me. I kissed her warm lips. "Baby," I breathed.\r\n"Diane, baby."\r\n\r\n"Paul, listen to me. We haven\'t much time.

"\r\n\r\n"All right, sweet." I kissed her again.\r\n\r\n"Come on. We can\'t afford to get there late."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI crouched low in the back of the racer. I heard the street noises,\r\nthe gab of the night crowds, the not-so-mild cursings of the taxi-jet\r\ndrivers.\r\n\r\nIt all seemed so unreal. Back there, on my haunches, a wrench gripped\r\ntight in my sweaty hand. I was going to kill a man. A man I knew, a man\r\nI respected. And for a woman. 

All for a woman. I thought about getting\r\nup and telling Diane to go to hell and to get herself another stooge. I\r\nthought about a lot of things. Then I thought of Diane. Her sweet white\r\nbody. The way she sighed when I kissed her hard. And I knew I was going\r\nto go through with it.\r\n\r\nThe racer stopped, its jets cut off. I heard the hum as the door opened\r\nand she got out.\r\n\r\nThis was it. I sweated. It dripped down in an endless stream.\r\n\r\nThe seconds went by. Then the minutes.\r\n\r\nThey got in and the door hummed shut and I heard their laughter\r\nblending together. They settled back and the jets roared. The racer\r\nwoke up to new life and it shot away.\r\n\r\n"How was the trip?" I heard Diane asking.\r\n\r\n"Cold. And I\'m not sure it was worth it. Those Martians drive a hard\r\nbargain." He coughed. "Diane, you\'re not too set on going out tonight,\r\nare you?"\r\n\r\n"Why?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"I thought how nice it would be if we spent the evening at home."\r\n\r\n"Just as you say, Roger."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t care?"\r\n\r\n"Of course not.

"\r\n\r\nShe was so calm, so damn calm. There would never be another like Diane.\r\n\r\n"You won\'t regret it," Roger promised.\r\n\r\n"My, but this boulevard is deserted," she said. "Not a soul in sight.

"\r\n\r\nThat was for my benefit. It was my cue.\r\n\r\nI sat up silently.\r\n\r\nHe saw me then in the rear-view mirror. "What the hell?" He started to\r\nturn.\r\n\r\nMy arm sprang alive. The wrench thudded against his skull. A half cry\r\nspilled from his lips. Then his head fell forward on his chest.\r\n\r\n"Hit him again," Diane urged.\r\n\r\n"But--"\r\n\r\n"Do as I say."\r\n\r\nI hit him again, hard.\r\n\r\nIt was done. I settled back. The wrench was still in my hand. I looked\r\nat it, then let it fall.\r\n\r\n"Are you all right?" Diane asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes," I said. "Why shouldn\'t I be?"\r\n\r\n"You\'re not going to be sick, are you?"\r\n\r\n"No! You think I\'m a kid?"\r\n\r\n"You did it for an old woman."\r\n\r\n"Stop it."\r\n\r\n"Today is my birthday, don\'t you know? I\'m thirty."\r\n\r\n"Shut up."\r\n\r\n"I wonder what he got for my birthday."\r\n\r\n"Please."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry. 

Really I am. 

I feel like talking. If I don\'t I think I\'d\r\nscream."\r\n\r\nSo I let her talk. I didn\'t answer her. She babbled away like she was\r\ncrazy. She kept it up till we got to their apartment.\r\n\r\nDiane got out first and made sure the way was clear. "We\'ll use the\r\nback stairs," she said when she got back. "We both can manage him."\r\n\r\nIt was dark and it was late and we didn\'t see anybody. We went through\r\nthe service entrance. It was too heavy a load for me to do it alone.\r\nTwo flights up. Diane helped me with him.\r\n\r\nI breathed easier when we were in the marble hall outside the\r\napartment. 

She quickly unlocked the heavy plastic door and we got him\r\ninside. She fumbled for the inner-lighting switch.\r\n\r\n"Happy birthday," they shouted.\r\n\r\nNow I knew why Roger had wanted to spend the evening at home.\r\n\r\nWe stood there, Diane and myself, with Roger between us.\r\n\r\nThen they stopped shouting and stared at us. I thought they would never\r\nstop staring.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


We\'ll have to put Edwards to work on it\r\nwhen we go back upstairs."\r\n\r\nWe spotted an airport on the outskirts of a large city. The runways were\r\nlaid out with the precision of Earth\'s finest. I put our ship\'s nose\r\neastward on a runway and took it down fast through a lull in the\r\natmosphere ship traffic.\r\n\r\nAs we went down I saw tiny buildings spotted on the field which surely\r\nhoused electronic equipment, but our receivers remained silent.\r\n\r\nI taxied the shuttle up to an unloading ramp before the airport\'s\r\nterminal building and I killed the drive.\r\n\r\n"Harry," I said, "if it weren\'t that their ships are so outlandishly\r\nstubby and their buildings so outflung, we might well be on Earth!"\r\n\r\n"I agree, Captain. 

Strange, though, that they\'re not mobbing us. 

They\r\ncouldn\'t take this delta-winged job for one of their ships!"\r\n\r\nIt _was_ strange.\r\n\r\nI looked up at the observation ramp\'s occupants--people who except for\r\ntheir bizarre dress might well be of Earth--and saw no curiosity in the\r\neyes that sometimes swept across our position.\r\n\r\n"Be that as it may, Harry, we certainly should cause a stir in these\r\npressure suits. Let\'s go!

"\r\n\r\nWe walked up to a dour-looking individual at a counter at the ramp\'s\r\nend. 

Clearing my throat, I said rather inanely, "Hello!"--but what\r\n_does_ one say to an extrasolarian?\r\n\r\nI realized then that my voice seemed thunderous, that the only other\r\nsounds came from a distance: the city\'s noise, the atmosphere ships\'\r\nengines on the horizon--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Centaurian ignored us.\r\n\r\nI looked at the atmosphere ships in the clear blue sky, at the\r\nCentaurians on the ramp who appeared to be conversing--and there was no\r\nsound from those planes, no sound from the people!\r\n\r\n"It\'s impossible," Harry said. "The atmosphere\'s nearly Earth-normal. It\r\nshould be--well, damn it, it _is_ as sound-conductive; _we\'re_ talking,\r\naren\'t we?"\r\n\r\nI looked up at the Centaurians again. They were looking excitedly\r\nwestward. 

Some turned to companions. Mouths opened and closed to form\r\nwords we could not hear. 

Wide eyes lowered, following something I could\r\nnot see. Sick inside, I turned to Albrecht and read confirmation in his\r\ndrawn, blanched face.\r\n\r\n"Captain," he said, "I suspected that we might find something like this\r\nwhen we first came out of hyperspace and the big sleep. The recorders\r\nshowed we\'d exceeded light-speed in normal space-time just after the\r\ntransition. Einstein theorized that time would not pass as swiftly to\r\nthose approaching light-speed. We could safely exceed that speed in\r\nhyperspace but should never have done so in normal space-time. Beyond\r\nlight-speed time must conversely accelerate!\r\n\r\n"These people haven\'t seen _us_ yet. They certainly just observed our\r\nlanding. As we suspected, they probably do have speech and radio--but we\r\ncan\'t pick up either. We\'re seconds ahead of them in time and we can\'t\r\npick up from the past sounds of nearby origin or nearby signals radiated\r\nat light-speed. They\'ll see and hear us soon, but we\'ll never receive an\r\nanswer from _them_! Our questions will come to them in their future but\r\nwe can never pick answers from their past!"\r\n\r\n"Let\'s go, Harry," I said quickly.\r\n\r\n"Where?" he asked. "Where can we ever go that will be an improvement\r\nover this?" He was resigned.\r\n\r\n"Back into space," I said. "Back to circle this system at a\r\nnear-light-speed. The computers should be able to determine how long and\r\nhow slow we\'ll have to fly to cancel this out. If not, we are truly and\r\nforever lost!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ January 1954.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

Another. The city yawned.\r\n\r\nRows of houses lay like square ivory beads on patches of green felt. A\r\nboy drove his bicycle down the middle of an elm-bordered avenue,\r\nwhistling loudly, while tightly rolled newspapers arced from his hand\r\nand slapped against porches.\r\n\r\nLights snapped on in a thousand windows, shining yellowly against the\r\ncool whiteness of dawn. Men blinked and touched beard-stubbled chins.\r\nWomen moved sleepily toward porcelain and chrome kitchens.\r\n\r\nA truck roared and garbage pails rattled. There was a smell of sour\r\norange rinds and wet leaves and unfolding flowers. Over this came the\r\nsmell of toasting bread and frying bacon.\r\n\r\nDoors swung open, slippered feet padded across porches and hands groped\r\nfor the rolled newspapers. The air was stricken with the blaring sound\r\nof transcribed music and the excited voices of commercial announcers.\r\nThe doors swung shut and the sounds were muted.\r\n\r\nA million people shifted and stretched and scratched. The sun rose above\r\nthe horizon.\r\n\r\nCelebrity day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDoors slammed again, and half-consumed cups of coffee lay cooling\r\nbehind. Children wiped at sleepy eyes and mothers swept crumbs, touching\r\nself-conscious fingers at their own bed-ruffled hair. 

Laborers and\r\nclerks and lawyers and doctors strode down sidewalks and climbed into\r\nautomobiles and busses and sleek-nosed elevated trains. The city moved.\r\n\r\nTo the center of the city, where the tall buildings stretched to the\r\nlighting sky, came the horde, like thousands of ants toward a comb of\r\nhoney. Wheels sang and whined. 

Horns blasted. Whistles blew.\r\n\r\nAnd waiting, strung above the wide streets between the cold marquees and\r\nthe dead neon tubes, were the banners and the flags and the bunting.\r\n\r\nThe air warmed and the sun brightened. Voices chattered. Elbows nudged.\r\nMouths smiled, teeth shone, and there was the sound of laughter, rising\r\nover the pushing throngs. The city was happy.\r\n\r\nThe bunting dipped and the banners fluttered and the flags whipped. At\r\nthe edge of the city, the airport tightened itself. Waiting, waiting for\r\nthe silver and blue rocket. The rocket of the Celebrity.\r\n\r\nA large hotel, towering above the pulsing streets, began the quiver of\r\nactivity. As though a great electric current had been run through its\r\ncubes and shafts and hollows, the hotel crackled. Desk clerks clicked\r\nbells and bell boys hopped. Elevators rose and fell. In the cellar, wine\r\nbottles were dusted by quick, nervous hands. In the kitchen, a towering\r\ncake was frosted and decorated. Orders cracked. Hands flew and feet\r\nchattered against tile. In one rich expansive suite a giant hoop of\r\nmulti-colored flowers was placed in the center of a room.\r\n\r\nIt was in the air. Laughter, awe, worship, _excitement_!\r\n\r\nRopes went up and stretched between lamp posts. Blue-coated men on\r\nhorses began blocking streets. Old women with wooden boxes, children\r\nwith flashing eyes, men in rich suits and tattered suits began filling\r\nthe sidewalks.\r\n\r\nCurbs became lined with people. Bars threw open doors and fresh air met\r\nstale air. Men with fat faces, thin faces, white faces, red faces,\r\ntwitching with the anticipation of holiday freedom, gulped jiggers of\r\nraw whiskey and shuddered happily.\r\n\r\nChildren giggled and yelled and sprinted in crazy zig-zags. Men in white\r\ncaps hustled in front of the lined curbs, shouting, carrying their boxes\r\nof ice-cream. Men with buttons, men with pennants, men with balloons\r\njoined the shouting, and the sound rose in the air and the city smiled\r\nand shifted and its heart pounded.\r\n\r\nThe hotel whirred inside itself. The airport tensed and searched the\r\nsky.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTime moved and the swelling throngs jammed the sidewalks, raising their\r\nstrengthening sound between the tall buildings. Windows popped open and\r\nfaces beamed. Tentative showers of confetti drifted down through the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nThe city waited, its pulse thumping.\r\n\r\nThe rocket was a black point in the sky. It grew. 

White-suited men\r\nscattered over the landing strip. Photographers crouched. Bulbs snapped\r\ninto reflectors. Cameras pointed.\r\n\r\nThe rocket landed. A door snapped open. Blue uniforms converged and\r\nflash bulbs popped. There were shouts and orders and men running. Gates\r\nswung and there was a blue-rimmed movement to a black open car. Sirens\r\nmoaned, screamed. And the black car was moving swiftly into the city.\r\n\r\nBeneath the buildings, marching bands in red and blue and yellow\r\nuniforms stood assembled. Girls in short skirts and tasseled hats spun\r\nsilver batons into the warm air. Bare legs kicked. Black boots flashed.\r\n\r\nThe crowd swayed against the ropes, and there was laughter and sweating\r\nand squinting.\r\n\r\nThe black car reached the heart of the city. Sirens died. 

Rows of men\r\nsnapped to attention. Policemen aligned their motorcycles.\r\n\r\nA baton shimmered high against the sun and came down.\r\n\r\nA cymbal crashed. Drums cracked. 

Music blared. And there was a movement\r\ndown the street.\r\n\r\nThe black car rolled along, while tape swept down from the buildings in\r\nlong swirling ribbons. There was a snow of confetti. 

And from the\r\nthroats of the people came the first roar. It grew, building, building\r\nin volume, and the city thundered its welcome to the man sitting upon\r\nthe back of the open car, the small man who tipped his hat and smiled\r\nand blinked behind his glasses: Joseph S. Stettison, B.A., B.S., M.S.,\r\nM.D., Ph.D., L.M. (Hon.

copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Young came bounding into the office of _Atomic Science Stories_,\r\nwaving a copy of the first issue in his hand. He stopped at the desk of\r\nthe editor, Art Holderness.\r\n\r\n"Holderness," he roared, his chins quivering, "you\'re fired!"\r\n\r\nHolderness looked up in surprise. 

"Why?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Look at this contents page!"\r\n\r\nHolderness looked at it. "What\'s the matter with it?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you see anything wrong?"\r\n\r\n"No. What shouldn\'t be there?"\r\n\r\n"There isn\'t anything shouldn\'t be there, you idiot. There\'s something\r\nmissing!"\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"Our announcement that the characters and situations in these stories\r\nbear no resemblance to actual persons living or dead."\r\n\r\n"Oh."\r\n\r\n"Is that all you have to say? Think of the libel suits! 

We\'ll be\r\nruined. I don\'t know why I let myself be talked into adding a science\r\nfiction book anyway. Holderness, you\'re fired.

"\r\n\r\n"But Mr. Young--"\r\n\r\n"You have no idea the trouble we can get into leaving that announcement\r\noff. Get out of this office!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nK-17 removed a copy of _Atomic Science Stories_ from the newsstand and\r\nwent up to his hotel room. He sat down to read it.\r\n\r\nHe had been attracted by the picture of the space ship on the cover,\r\nbecause it reminded him very much of the one in which he had come\r\nto Earth from Rigel IV. And then, when he looked closer at it, he\r\ndiscovered that the four-tentacled purple creatures in the ship looked\r\nnot a little like his fellow Rigelians.\r\n\r\nThis made him homesick, and so, in direct defiance of the orders he had\r\nreceived from his superiors, he pulled down the shades and turned off\r\nthe gadget that set up the hypnotic field around him. Once more he was\r\nfour-tentacled and purple, instead of two-armed and pink, and it felt\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nHe began to read through the stories. The first of them concerned an\r\ninvader from another planet who was on Earth disguised as a man.\r\n\r\nGood Vog! K-17 thought to himself. 

They\'re on to us.\r\n\r\nHe looked over the story again. They had some of the details wrong,\r\nof course, such as saying that the Rigelians--whom they called the\r\nCapellans, for some strange reason--had mouths like octopi, whereas\r\nactually they had no mouths at all. But on the whole it was a\r\ncircumstantial and convincing account of the capture of a Rigelian spy.\r\n\r\nThe story had taken place in Philadelphia. That meant they had M-22.\r\nThis was serious. He picked up his magneto-oscillophone and called the\r\nhome base on the other side of the moon.\r\n\r\n"This is K-17," he reported. "I have just read in a Terran publication\r\ndetails of the capture of M-22."\r\n\r\n"Impossible!" the voice snorted in his auditory nerve. "We have been\r\nreceiving regular reports from M-22."\r\n\r\n"They must have replaced him with a human spy," K-17 mused.\r\n\r\n"Good Vog! Do you really think so?

"\r\n\r\n"It\'s the only explanation."\r\n\r\n"Good work, K-17. We\'ll be on our guard.

"\r\n\r\nK-17 hung up and sat down again to read further. The next story dealt\r\nwith an Earth landing on Mars.\r\n\r\nBut Earthmen _hadn\'t_ landed on Mars.\r\n\r\nOr had they?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis situation was becoming complicated. K-17 thought over all the\r\npossibilities. Was it possible that this magazine contained only\r\nFiction? The title of the thing was _Atomic Science Stories_. He\r\nremembered that he had read a similar magazine called _Impossible\r\nScience Fiction_. Was the distinction between "stories" and "fiction"\r\nsignificant? A fiction was obviously false; but a story could be any\r\nnarrative, true or not. Did this mean--? Good Vog, he wished he knew\r\nmore about Earth culture. But that was what he was here to find out.\r\nThey knew nothing, absolutely nothing, about Earth people. And they\r\ndidn\'t want to try to kill the inhabitants and take over the planet\r\nwithout knowing more about them.\r\n\r\nHe looked closely at the title page of _Atomic Science Stories_. He\r\nrecalled that _Impossible Science Fiction_, which he had, of course,\r\nread every word of, carried an announcement that all the stories were\r\nfiction. He did not see any such announcement on the title page of\r\n_Atomic_. Doubt was wavering into certainty in his mind.\r\n\r\nHe telephoned the offices of the Young Publishing Co., which published\r\nthe magazine. The secretary informed him that the editor, Mr.\r\nHolderness, had been discharged that very morning.\r\n\r\nDischarged, K-17 meditated. Why discharged? Well, he told himself, if\r\nEarth had space travel and was keeping it a secret, and if a magazine\r\nviolated its security precautions and published a story about it, of\r\ncourse they\'d discharge the editor. If it was a fiction magazine, that\r\nwould be different. But a magazine that printed _stories_--some of them\r\ntrue, like the one about the capture of M-22....\r\n\r\nHe called headquarters again, on his magneto-oscillophone. "Earth has\r\nspace travel!" he announced breathlessly.\r\n\r\n"What? 

Don\'t be silly." The voice in his auditory nerve was irritated.\r\n\r\n"A magazine published an account of it, and the editor was discharged\r\nthis morning for security reasons."\r\n\r\n"What? Are you sure?"\r\n\r\n"I just telephoned the office of the magazine and verified everything."\r\n\r\n"Report to the saucer station immediately. You\'re coming back to\r\nheadquarters. We\'ll get out the word to all our other operatives."\r\n\r\n"Except M-22."\r\n\r\n"Yes, of course. We\'ll have to leave him behind. It\'s really too bad.\r\nThe planet offered such nice possibilities.

"\r\n\r\nThey hung up.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"No, Holderness," Mr. Fribble said, "our magazine can\'t use you either.\r\nWe can\'t have an editor who\'s careless enough to leave off the standard\r\ndisclaimer. Why, there\'s no end of trouble we\'d get into without that\r\nlittle announcement."\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n

S. copyright on this publication\r\nwas renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   It\'s amazing how much you can learn about absolute strangers if\r\n   you just stop to think about the kind of an animal they\'ll put\r\n   in a ...\r\n\r\n\r\nTEST ROCKET!\r\n\r\nBy JACK DOUGLAS\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cover]\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Baird stood at the window of the laboratory where the\r\nthousand parts of the strange rocket lay strewn in careful order.\r\nSmall groups worked slowly over the dismantled parts. The captain\r\nwanted to ask but something stopped him. 

Behind him Doctor\r\nJohannsen sat at his desk, his gnarled old hand tight about a\r\nwhiskey bottle, the bottle the doctor always had in his desk but\r\nnever brought out except when he was alone, and waited for Captain\r\nBaird to ask his question. Captain Baird turned at last.\r\n\r\n"They are our markings?" Captain Baird asked. It was not the\r\nquestion. Captain Baird knew the markings of the Rocket Testing\r\nStation as well as the doctor did.\r\n\r\n"Yes," the doctor said, "they are our markings. Identical. 

But not\r\nour paint."\r\n\r\nCaptain Baird turned back to the window. 

Six months ago it had\r\nhappened. Ten minutes after launching, the giant test rocket had\r\nbeen only a speck on the observation screen. Captain Baird had\r\nturned away in disgust.\r\n\r\n"A mouse!" the captain had said, "unfortunate a mouse can\'t\r\nobserve, build, report. My men are getting restless, Johannsen."\r\n\r\n"When we are ready, Captain," the doctor had said.\r\n\r\nIt was twelve hours before the urgent call from Central Control\r\nbrought the captain running back to the laboratory. The doctor was\r\nthere before him. Professor Schultz wasted no time, he pointed to\r\nthe instrument panel. "A sudden shift, see for yourself. We\'ll\r\nmiss Mars by a million and a quarter at least."\r\n\r\nTwo hours later the shift in course of the test rocket was\r\napparent to all of them and so was their disappointment.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n"According to the instruments the steering shifted a quarter of an\r\ninch. No reason shows up," Professor Schultz said.\r\n\r\n"Flaw in the metal?" Doctor Johannsen said.\r\n\r\n"How far can it go?" 

Captain Baird asked.\r\n\r\nProfessor Schultz shrugged. "Until the fuel runs out, which is\r\nprobably as good as never, or until the landing mechanism is\r\nactivated by a planet-sized body."\r\n\r\n"Course? Did you plot it?" The doctor asked.\r\n\r\n"Of course I did," Professor Schultz said, "as close as I can\r\ncalculate it is headed for Alpha Centauri."\r\n\r\nCaptain Baird turned away. The doctor watched him.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you will not be quite so hasty with your men\'s lives in\r\nthe future, Captain?" the doctor said.\r\n\r\nProfessor Schultz was spinning dials. "No contact," the professor\r\nsaid, "No contact at all."\r\n\r\nThat had been six months ago. Three more test rockets had been\r\nfired successfully before the urgent report came through from\r\nAlaskan Observation Post No. 4. A rocket was coming across the\r\nPole.\r\n\r\nThe strange rocket was tracked and escorted by atomic armed\r\nfighters all the way to the Rocket Testing Station where it cut\r\nits own motors and gently landed. In the center of a division of\r\natomic-armed infantry the captain, the doctor, and everyone else,\r\nwaited impatiently. There was an air of uneasiness.\r\n\r\n"You\'re sure it\'s not ours?" Captain Baird asked.\r\n\r\nThe doctor laughed. "Identical, yes, but three times the size of\r\nours.

"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps one of the Asian ones?"\r\n\r\n"No, it\'s our design, but too large, much too large."\r\n\r\nProfessor Schultz put their thoughts into words. "Looks like\r\nsomeone copied ours. Someone, somewhere. 

It\'s hard to imagine, but\r\ntrue nevertheless."\r\n\r\nThey waited two weeks. 

Nothing happened. Then a radiation-shielded\r\nteam went in to examine the rocket. Two more weeks and the strange\r\nrocket was dismantled and spread over the field of the testing\r\nstation. The rocket was dismantled and the station had begun to\r\ntalk to itself in whispers and look at the sky.\r\n\r\nCaptain Baird stood now at the window and looked out at the\r\ndismantled rocket. He looked but his mind was not on the parts of\r\nthe rocket he could see from the window.\r\n\r\n"The materials, they\'re not ours?" the captain asked.\r\n\r\n"Unknown here," the doctor said.\r\n\r\nThe captain nodded. "Those were our instruments?"\r\n\r\n"Yes." The doctor still held the whiskey bottle in a tight grip.\r\n\r\n"They sent them back," the captain said.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe doctor crashed the bottle hard against the desk top. "Ask it,\r\nCaptain, for God\'s sake!!"\r\n\r\nThe captain turned to face the doctor directly. "It was a man, a\r\nfull grown man."\r\n\r\nThe doctor sighed as if letting the pent-up steam of his heart\r\nescape. "Yes, it is a man. It breathes, it eats, it has all the\r\nattributes of a man. 

But it is not of our planet."\r\n\r\n"Its speech ..." the captain began.\r\n\r\n"That isn\'t speech, Captain," the doctor broke in, breaking in\r\nsharply, "It\'s only sound." The doctor stopped; he examined the\r\nlabel of his bottle of whiskey very carefully. A good brand of\r\nwhiskey. "He seems quite happy in the storeroom. You know,\r\nCaptain, what puzzled me at first? He can\'t read. He can\'t read\r\nanything, not even the instruments in that ship. In fact he shows\r\nno interest in his rocket at all."\r\n\r\nThe captain sat down now. He sat at the desk and faced the doctor.\r\n"At least _they_ had the courage to send a man, not a mouse.\r\nDoctor, a man."\r\n\r\nThe doctor stared at the captain, his hand squeezing and\r\nunsqueezing on the whiskey bottle. "A man who can\'t read his own\r\ninstruments?" The doctor laughed. "Perhaps you too have failed to\r\nsee the point? Like that stupid general who sits out there waiting\r\nfor the men from somewhere to invade?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think it\'s a possibility?"\r\n\r\nThe doctor nodded. "A very good possibility, Captain, but they\r\nwill not be men." The doctor seemed to pause and lean forward.\r\n"That rocket, Captain, is a test rocket. A test rocket _just like\r\nours_!"\r\n\r\nThen the doctor picked up his whiskey bottle at last and poured\r\ntwo glasses.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps a drink, Captain?"\r\n\r\nThe captain was watching the sky outside the window.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n


It may not take\r\n so long for a spaceman to learn ..._\r\n\r\nBy JOHN CORY\r\n\r\nIllustrated by Gardner\r\n\r\n\r\nNear the end of his fifteenth orbit as Greenland slipped by noiselessly\r\nbelow, he made the routine measurements that tested the operation of his\r\nspace capsule and checked the automatic instruments which would transmit\r\ntheir stored data to Earth on his next pass over Control. Everything\r\nnormal; all mechanical devices were operating perfectly.\r\n\r\nThis information didn\'t surprise him, in fact, he really didn\'t even\r\nthink about it. The previous orbits and the long simulated flights on\r\nEarth during training had made such checks routine and perfect results\r\nexpected. The capsules were developed by exhaustive testing both on the\r\nground and as empty satellites before entrusting them to carry animals\r\nand then the first human.\r\n\r\nHe returned to contemplation of the panorama passing below and above,\r\nalthough as he noted idly, above and below had lost some of their usual\r\nmeaning. Since his capsule, like all heavenly bodies, was stable in\r\nposition with respect to the entire universe and, thanks to Sir Isaac\r\nNewton and his laws, never changed, the Earth and the stars alternated\r\nover his head during each orbit. "Up" now meant whatever was in the\r\ndirection of his head. He remembered that even during his initial orbit\r\nwhen the Earth first appeared overhead he accepted the fact as normal.\r\nHe wondered if the other two had accepted it as easily.\r\n\r\nFor there had been two men hurled into orbit before he ventured into\r\nspace. Two others who had also passed the rigorous three-year training\r\nperiod and were selected on the basis of over-all performance to precede\r\nhim. 

He had known them both well and wondered again what had happened on\r\ntheir flights. 

Of course, they had both returned, depending upon what\r\nyour definition of return was. The capsules in which they had ventured\r\nbeyond Earth had returned them living. But this was to be expected, for\r\neven the considerable hazards of descent through the atmosphere and the\r\nterrible heating which occurred were successfully surmounted by the\r\ncapsule.\r\n\r\nNaturally, it had not been expected that the satellites would have to be\r\nbrought down by command from the ground. But this, too, was part of the\r\ncareful planning--radio control of the retro-rockets that move the\r\nsatellite out of orbit by reducing its velocity. Of course, ground\r\ncontrol was to be used only if the astronaut failed to ignite the\r\nretro-rockets himself. He remembered everyone\'s surprise and relief when\r\nthe first capsule was recovered and its occupant found to be alive. They\r\nhad assumed that in spite of all precautions he was dead because he had\r\nnot fired the rockets on the fiftieth orbit and it was necessary to\r\nbring him down on the sixty-fifth.\r\n\r\nRecovery alive only partially solved the mystery, for the rescuers and\r\nall others were met by a haughty, stony silence from the occupant.\r\nBatteries of tests confirmed an early diagnosis: complete and utter\r\nwithdrawal; absolute refusal to communicate. Therapy was unsuccessful.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe second attempt was similar in most respects, except that command\r\nreturn was made on the thirty-first orbit after the astronaut\'s failure\r\nto de-orbit at the end of the thirtieth. His incoherent babble of moons,\r\nstars, and worlds was no more helpful than the first.\r\n\r\nTest after test confirmed that no obvious organic damage had been\r\nincurred by exposure outside of the Earth\'s protective atmosphere.\r\nBiopsy of even selected brain tissues seemed to show that microscopic\r\ncellular changes due to prolonged weightlessness or primary cosmic-ray\r\nbombardment, which had been suggested by some authorities, were\r\nunimportant. Somewhat reluctantly, it was decided to repeat the\r\nexperiment a third time.\r\n\r\nThe launching was uneventful. He was sent into space with the precision\r\nhe expected. The experience was exhilarating and, although he had\r\nanticipated each event in advance, he could not possibly have foreseen\r\nthe overpowering feeling that came over him. Weightlessness he had\r\nexperienced for brief periods during training, but nothing could match\r\nthe heady impression of continuous freedom from gravity.\r\n\r\nEarth passing overhead was also to be expected from the simple laws of\r\ncelestial mechanics but his feeling as he watched it now was\r\ninexpressible. It occurred to him that perhaps this was indeed why he\r\nwas here, because he could appreciate such experiences best. He had been\r\ntold the stars would be bright, unblinking, and an infinitude in extent,\r\nbut could mere descriptions or photographs convey the true seeing?\r\n\r\nOn his twenty-first orbit he completed his overseeing the entire surface\r\nof the planet in daylight. He had seen more of Earth than anyone able to\r\ntell about it, but only he had the true feeling of it. The continents\r\nwere clearly visible, as were the oceans and both polar ice caps. The\r\nshapes were familiar but in only a remote way. 

A vague indistinctness\r\nborne of distance served to modify the outlines and he alone was seeing\r\nand understanding. On the dark side of the planet large cities were\r\nmarked by indistinct light areas which paled to insignificance compared\r\nto the stars and his sun.\r\n\r\nHe speculated about the others who had only briefly experienced these\r\nsights. 

Undoubtedly they weren\'t as capable of fully grasping or\r\nappreciating any of these things as he was. It was quite clear that no\r\none else but he could encompass the towering feeling of power and\r\nimportance generated by being alone in the Universe.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the twenty-fifth orbit he disabled the radio control of\r\nthe retro-rockets and sat back with satisfaction to await the next\r\ncircuit of his Earth around Him.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Astounding Science Fiction_ May 1960.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

]\r\n\r\n\r\nCoxe, an unusually phlegmatic citizen, came to buy the new refrigerator\r\nin the usual fashion. He was looking for a bargain. It was the latest\r\nmodel, fresh from the new production line in Los Angeles, and was\r\nmarked down considerably below standard. The freezing compartment held\r\n245 lbs. of meat.\r\n\r\n"How come so cheap?" Coxe wanted to know.\r\n\r\n"Frankly," the salesman said, "I asked myself that. Usually there\'s a\r\ndent in them or something, when they have that factory tag on them. But\r\nI checked it over and I can\'t find anything wrong with it. 

However,\r\nshe goes as is."\r\n\r\n"At that price," Coxe said, "I\'ll take it."\r\n\r\nIt arrived, refinished in a copper color to his specifications, the\r\nfollowing Tuesday. 

It was plugged in and operated perfectly. He checked\r\nit out by freezing ice cubes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWednesday evening, when he opened the door to chill some beer, there\r\nwas a package in the freezing compartment. He took out the package.\r\n\r\nIt was some sort of plastic and appeared to contain fish eggs.\r\n\r\nCoxe had not seen fresh fish eggs, considered by some a delicacy, for\r\na number of years.\r\n\r\nHe chilled the beer and fried the eggs.\r\n\r\nBoth tasted about right.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following Friday, his girl friend came over to fix dinner for him,\r\nand when she looked in the freezing compartment, she said, "What\'s\r\nthis?"\r\n\r\n"Fish eggs," Coxe said. "How many of them?"\r\n\r\n"Two packages."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll fry them up for breakfast," he said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSaturday morning, there were three packages of eggs in the refrigerator.\r\n\r\n"Where do they come from?" his girl friend wanted to know.\r\n\r\n"They just appear. I ate some and they\'re very good."\r\n\r\nShe was reluctant, but he talked her into preparing a package.\r\n\r\nShe agreed they were very good.\r\n\r\n"What are you going to do about it?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think there\'s anything to do about it," he said. "I like fish\r\neggs."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, the package they had eaten Saturday had been replaced. They\r\nwere coming in at a steady rate of one a day. Coxe cooked a package for\r\nbreakfast and took the other two to his parents.\r\n\r\nBy Tuesday, he was getting tired of the eggs, and by the end of the\r\nweek, he had four more packages. He succeeded in giving two packages to\r\nthe neighbors.\r\n\r\nAt the end of another week, he had eight packages.\r\n\r\nHe explained to his girl friend. She suggested they visit all their\r\nfriends, leaving a package with each of them.\r\n\r\nAt the end of another two weeks, this method for disposing of the eggs\r\nhad worn thin. They finally managed to give the last two packages to\r\nthe landlady.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the end of still another week, there were seven more packages.\r\nOtherwise, the refrigerator was a good buy.\r\n\r\nCoxe calculated that, at the present rate, had he left the packages in\r\nthe compartment, it would have been filled by the end of the month.\r\nHe felt that once that point was reached, the eggs would stop coming.\r\nShould this prove to be incorrect, he was prepared to arrange for some\r\nmethod of commercial distribution for the product.\r\n\r\nOn schedule, the eggs stopped coming.\r\n\r\nHe waited two days. No more came. It was over.\r\n\r\nHe ate the last package.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe refrigerator worked perfectly, and he began to stock it with things\r\nfreezers are conventionally stocked with.\r\n\r\nIt was almost two weeks after the last package had appeared, early one\r\nSunday morning, when the doorbell rang.\r\n\r\nAt the door was a small, nondescript man with a vaguely--and really\r\nindefinably--unpleasant aspect. His head was bandaged.\r\n\r\n"Mr. 

Coxe?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"That\'s me."\r\n\r\n"May I come in?"\r\n\r\n"Come on."\r\n\r\nThe man seated himself. "Something terrible has happened," he said. "A\r\nhorrible mistake has been made."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry to hear that. You look as if you were in an accident."\r\n\r\n"I was. I\'ve been in the ... hospital ... for nearly two months. But\r\nto come to the point, Mr. 

Coxe. I\'ve come about the refrigerator you\r\nrecently purchased. It was a special refrigerator that was erroneously\r\nshipped out of the plant as a second. When I didn\'t come in, it got\r\nshipped out and sold."\r\n\r\n"Good refrigerator," Coxe said.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you\'ve noticed ... ah ... something unusual about it?"\r\n\r\n"It runs okay. For a while there were a bunch of packages of fish eggs\r\nin it."\r\n\r\n"Fish eggs!" the little man cried in horror. After he had recovered\r\nsufficiently, he asked, "You do, of course you do, I\'m sure you still\r\nhave all the ... little packages?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," said Coxe.\r\n\r\n"NO? Oh, my God. What did you do with them, Mr. Coxe?"\r\n\r\n"Ate them."\r\n\r\n"You ... ate ... them? Ate--? No. 

You didn\'t. Not all of them. You\r\ncouldn\'t have done that, Mr. Coxe. Please tell me that you could not\r\nhave done that."\r\n\r\n"I had to give a lot of them away, and everybody said they were\r\ndelicious. And really.... Uh, Mr.--? Mr., uh...."\r\n\r\nThe little man got unsteadily to his feet. His face was ashen. "This is\r\nhorrible, horrible." He stumbled to the door. 

"You are a fiend. All our\r\nwork ... all our plans ... and you, you...." He turned to Coxe. "I hate\r\nyou. 

Oh, I hate you."\r\n\r\n"Now, see here."\r\n\r\n"... 

Mr. Coxe, you\'ll never realize the enormity of your crime. _You\'ve\r\neaten all of us!_" With that, he slammed the door and was gone.\r\n\r\nCoxe went back to the other room.\r\n\r\n"Who was it, honey?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, some nut. Seems he had first claim on the refrigerator."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll bet it was about the fish eggs."\r\n\r\n"Yeah, he wanted them.

"\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear. Do you think he can do anything to us?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think so, not now. It\'s too late," Coxe concluded. "We ate\r\nthem all."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                They didn\'t have to worry about a thing\r\n                for the rest of their natural lives....\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Ypsilanti swung at the door with the steak cuber. Or was it\r\nthe cube steaker? No matter. The door was a good, hardwood door and\r\nresisted his onslaught well. But time was on his side.\r\n\r\nHe had the energy and the time, he knew, and sooner or later the door\r\nwould be kindling.\r\n\r\nIt was the door to his room. It was evident to him that he did not need\r\nthe door to his room and that he _did_ need heat. In fact he had better\r\nget some heat pretty soon--although he was keeping warm enough for the\r\npresent by beating on the door. So he would beat this door to kindling,\r\nand then he would build a nice, cozy fire in the hall that would keep\r\nhim warm for a long time ... if he was stingy with his fuel.\r\n\r\nThe carpenter came by. The carpenter was always coming by, except when\r\nyou wanted him, Jim realized. The carpenter was a mighty, mighty busy\r\nfellow.\r\n\r\nThe carpenter stopped short when he saw Jim demolishing the door. In\r\nfact he came to a grinding halt.\r\n\r\n"Jim, why didn\'t you tell me!"\r\n\r\n"Carpenter, how was I to know where you were? Who can ever find you?"\r\n\r\n"I know Jim. 

Jim, you work so hard!"\r\n\r\n"Yes!" he said, pounding.\r\n\r\n"Take this hatchet, Jim. A hatchet is what you demolish doors with!\r\nGood-by." The carpenter departed.\r\n\r\nJames Ypsilanti swung on the door with his newly acquired hatchet. Soon\r\nhe was ready for his fire. He struck a match, and in no time had the\r\npile of varnished kindling blazing smokily in the hall. He held his\r\nhands over the blaze.\r\n\r\n"Ah, good, good. Good." 

He closed his eyes. "What could be better than\r\nthis?" Then he opened them again regretfully. "It\'s dinner time. I\'d\r\nbetter fix it while I have my fire going." He hurried to the kitchen\r\nand chose a can of eggs-bacon-and-pancakes from the massive stores.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOpening the large can, he heated it over his hall fire. Then he dumped\r\nthe contents on his tin plate and ate.\r\n\r\n"Murder," he thought somberly. "That\'s what I\'m in for. 

Practically\r\nmurder with consent. She said she couldn\'t live without me. Margie\r\nbegged me to kill her, you might as well say. Good old Margie; a good\r\nkid, but I killed her. And now.... Well, that\'s life!" He speared a\r\npancake.\r\n\r\n"Damn, but it\'s _cold_!" He threw an armload of wood on the fire and it\r\nblazed up. "Sure wish these carpenters had feelings. My lord, they got\r\nno feelings at all!"\r\n\r\nThe carpenter arrived with a new hardwood door. Whistling cheerily, he\r\nbegan to install it where the other one had just been hatcheted away.\r\n\r\n"Carpenter, that door won\'t be staying there long. I\'m almost out of\r\nfuel."\r\n\r\n"I hope you don\'t expect me to be surprised, Jim, if this door doesn\'t\r\nlast very long. The previous twenty-two doors at this location,\r\nJim, did not last very long either." Still whistling to himself, he\r\ninstalled the last of the hinge screws.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you just _give_ me the doors, instead of causing yourself\r\nall this work?" demanded James Ypsilanti.\r\n\r\n"\'Inmates will not be issued materials,\' Jim. I\'ve quoted that section\r\nof the rules to you many times, Jim."\r\n\r\n"But couldn\'t you just _lean_ the door up against the door jamb and\r\nleave it?" argued the inmate. "You go to a ridiculous amount of\r\ntrouble."\r\n\r\n"It is not ridiculous, Jim. I am a carpenter, Jim. 

Good-by."\r\n\r\nAfter lunch, James Ypsilanti crawled into his escape tunnel.\r\n\r\nHe liked to go in there every day and daydream. The tunnel ended\r\nabortively at the wall of the prison, for the prison wall extended down\r\ninto solid bed rock for a meter, and it was fabricated of one-meter\r\nthick compressed steel. It was the nearest thing to an exit that the\r\nprison had.\r\n\r\nOfficials had always come and gone through the massive, englobing wall\r\nby matter transmitters. "Smarties couldn\'t find me though, when I was\r\nin my escape tunnel," he chortled, as he stretched out in the cave\r\nunder the concrete. "They can walk through walls, but they couldn\'t\r\nfind _me_." Then his tone became baleful. 

"The smarties\'ll never find\r\nme."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs James Ypsilanti chopped on the door next day, the carpenter stood\r\ncheerily watching.\r\n\r\n"Carpenter, why don\'t you fix the damn heating plant? Then I wouldn\'t\r\nhave to be chopping up your doors all the time to keep warm."\r\n\r\n"I am a carpenter, Jim, not a heat-plant fixer, as you well know from\r\nour previous negotiations on the subject."\r\n\r\n"What will you do, carpenter, when I have used up all your doors?" the\r\nconvict jibed.\r\n\r\n"Why, Jim, we will have to send out for some more," the carpenter\r\nanswered condescendingly.\r\n\r\n"Still, I wish you would let _me_ work on that heat plant," urged\r\nYpsilanti. "I might fix it."\r\n\r\n"\'Inmates will not be permitted to disassemble or otherwise interfere\r\nwith the machinery of the institution,\'" quoted the carpenter. "Need I\r\nsay more, Jim?"\r\n\r\n"Okay," said James Ypsilanti, resuming his destructive work on the new\r\ndoor. "Scram, stupid." The carpenter departed.\r\n\r\n"That dope," Jim said between blows, "is even foggier in the head than\r\nmy lousy lawyer was, and that\'s going some."\r\n\r\n"Jim," said the carpenter, returning and sounding very pleased with\r\nhimself, "look here at what I have found, Jim."\r\n\r\nJames Ypsilanti turned to look at what the carpenter held in his hand.\r\nIt was a carpenter\'s square sheathed in plastic.\r\n\r\n"Found enough of them to last me a lifetime, Jim," said the carpenter\r\ncomplacently. "I\'ll never have to buy any.

"\r\n\r\n"No, you won\'t," agreed James Ypsilanti bitterly. "Can\'t you get it\r\ninto your head that you and I are the only ones left on Earth? After\r\nthe war the rest left. They couldn\'t _find_ us when they evacuated this\r\natomic-explosion wrecked planet, because we were in this escape-proof\r\njug. So they went away and _left_ us!

"\r\n\r\n"I know, Jim."\r\n\r\nYpsilanti studied the mobile features of the carpenter, searching\r\nintently for a sign.\r\n\r\nBut the carpenter robot strolled away, whistling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


"If it is favorable, there is certain technical aid\r\naboard ship which will be made available to you at once. 

Of course, you\r\nwill not receive advanced equipment from the Solar Council until there\r\nis a more thorough investigation."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid our culture is too simple and agrarian to win your\r\napproval," said Saranta modestly.\r\n\r\n"That isn\'t a major consideration. The Council understands the\r\ndifficulties that have faced colonies in other star systems. There are\r\ncertain fundamental requirements, of course: no abnormal religious\r\npractices, no slavery ... well, you understand what I mean."\r\n\r\n"We really feel that we have done well since we ... our ancestors, that\r\nis ... colonized our world a thousand years ago," said Saranta, toying\r\nwith a wineglass. A smiling servant filled the glasses of Tardo and Peo.\r\n"You see, there was no fuel for the ship to explore other planets in the\r\nsystem, and the ship just rusted away. Since we are some distance from\r\nthe solar system, yours is the first ship that has landed here since\r\ncolonization."\r\n\r\n"You seem to have been lucky, though," said Peo. He was navigator of the\r\nCouncil ship, and had asked to accompany Tardo on the brief inspection\r\ntrip. "You could have landed on a barren planet."\r\n\r\n"Well, no, the colonizers knew it was liveable, from the first\r\nexploration expedition," said Saranta. "There were difficulties, of\r\ncourse. Luxuriant vegetation, but no animal life, so we had no animals\r\nto domesticate. Pulling a plow is hard work for a man."\r\n\r\n"But you were able to solve this situation in a humanitarian way?" asked\r\nTardo, peering at him keenly. 

"That is to say, you didn\'t resort to\r\nslavery?"\r\n\r\nSaranta smiled and spread his hands slightly.\r\n\r\n"Does this look like a slave society to you?" he countered. "The\r\ncolonists were anxious to co-operate to make the planet liveable. No one\r\nobjected to work."\r\n\r\n"It\'s true we\'ve seen no slaves, that we know about," said Tardo. "But\r\ntwo days is a short time for inspection. 

I must draw most of my\r\nconclusions from the attitudes of you and the others who are our hosts.\r\nHow about the servants here?"\r\n\r\n"They are paid," answered Saranta, and added ruefully: "There are those\r\nof us who think they are paid too well. They have a union, you know.

"\r\n\r\nTardo laughed.\r\n\r\n"A carry-over from Earth, no doubt," he commented. "An unusual one, too,\r\nfor a culture without technology."\r\n\r\nWhen the meal was over, the two men from the ship were conducted on a\r\ntour of the area. It was a neat agricultural community, with broad\r\nfields, well-constructed buildings and, a short distance from Saranta\'s\r\ncastle-like home, a village in which artisans and craftsmen plied their\r\npeaceful trades.\r\n\r\nPeo tried to notice what he thought Tardo would look for on such a short\r\ninspection. The Council agent, he knew, had had intensive training and\r\nmany years of experience. It was hard for Peo to judge what factors\r\nTardo would consider significant--probably very minor ones that the\r\naverage man would not notice, he thought.\r\n\r\nTardo had seemed most intent on the question of slavery, and Peo looked\r\nfor signs of it. He could see none. 

The people of the planet had had\r\ntime to conceal some things, of course. But the people they saw in the\r\nvillage wore a proud air of independence no slave could assume.\r\n\r\nSaranta apologized for their having to walk, explaining that there was\r\nno other means of transportation on the planet.\r\n\r\n"And, without transportation, you can understand why we have not been\r\nable to develop a technology," he added. "We hope transport will be\r\nincluded in the first assistance you will give us."\r\n\r\nTardo asked about the fields.\r\n\r\n"I see there is no one working them," he said. "Is that done by the\r\nvillagers?"\r\n\r\n"Our labor supply is transient," answered Saranta after a moment\'s\r\nhesitation. "The laborers who will work our fields--for a wage, of\r\ncourse--are probably in the next town or the one beyond it now."\r\n\r\nAlpha Persei was sinking in the western sky when Tardo and Peo took\r\ntheir leave of Saranta and made their way down the road toward their\r\nplanetary landing craft.\r\n\r\n"It looks like a good world to me," said Peo. "If tomorrow\'s inspection\r\nis as satisfactory, I suppose you will recommend the beginning of\r\ntechnical aid?"\r\n\r\n"There will be no inspection tour tomorrow, and I shall recommend\r\nagainst aid at this time," replied Tardo. "I\'ve seen enough."\r\n\r\n"Why?" asked Peo, surprised.\r\n\r\n"There are two classes of people on this planet, and we\'ve seen only\r\none," said Tardo. "Those we have seen are freemen. The others are no\r\nbetter than animals. We give no aid that helps men tighten their hold\r\nover their fellows."\r\n\r\n"If you haven\'t seen them, how do you know there is another class?"\r\ndemanded Peo. "There is no evidence of any such situation.

"\r\n\r\n"The evidence is well hidden. But if you think your stomach can take it\r\nnow, I\'ll tell you. If you remember your history, colonizing ships 1000\r\nyears ago had no space to carry animals along. They had to depend on\r\nnative animal life of the planet, and this planet had none."\r\n\r\n"Saranta said that. But I don\'t see ..."\r\n\r\n"Those were delicious steaks, weren\'t they?" remarked Tardo quietly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _If Worlds of Science Fiction_\r\n    September 1954.

This would be a\r\n"green light" customer--a first-time prospect, and three blinks\r\nindicated a very difficult individual. Anson quickly practiced his\r\nmost beguiling smile.\r\n\r\n"Welcome to Tracy\'s Roboid Department," he said, enthusiastically, as\r\nthe elevator doors slid open. His practiced smile was just right.\r\n\r\nHe quickly noted the man\'s conservative dress, the flaming red tie.\r\nAggressive type, Anson decided. A shock of red hair that didn\'t want\r\nto lie down hinted that he was stubborn as well.\r\n\r\n"Heard you\'ve got a sale on robots," Red-tie said, challengingly, as\r\nhe stepped aside for his wife.\r\n\r\nThe woman who stepped off the elevator smiled, showing a lovely\r\ndimple, and Anson beamed on her. The tiny flake of a hat perched atop\r\nher auburn hair reminded Anson of the comb on a Rhode Island Red.\r\n\r\n"Not robots, sir," Anson corrected diplomatically. "The Plasti-Cast\r\nRoboid is not exactly a robot."\r\n\r\n"Well, anyhow, trot one out, and let\'s see what it looks like.\r\nMillicent will never be satisfied until she\'s seen one of the things."\r\nHe glared dramatically in the general direction of his wife, who\r\npretended not to notice.\r\n\r\nAnson led them into the Gray Room. He mentally went over the\r\napplicable rule: _Rule 23; Always introduce the marked-down\r\nmerchandise first. It may provide the customer with an incentive for\r\nbuying something better._\r\n\r\n"These are last year\'s models," he said, with just the right flavor\r\nof distaste in his voice. "Of course, you may expect a slight\r\nreduction ... a small percentage...."\r\n\r\nRed-tie was muttering. "Damned mechanical things, full of wheels and\r\nwires. What\'s to keep \'em from running amok and killing us all!

"\r\n\r\n"But dear, they don\'t have wheels anymore," protested the woman,\r\ntimidly. Her face was pretty, Anson decided, but it was obvious that\r\nthe man would be the deciding factor in this sale.\r\n\r\nHe made a mental note: _Rule 31: Pick the individual of a family group\r\nwho seems to hold the deciding voice, and SELL!_ He remembered a\r\nportion of a sales talk he had memorized a few days before, and took\r\nit up, almost chanting:\r\n\r\n"... our Roboids are grown, much as crystals are grown, in great vats\r\nin New Chicago. A Plasti-Cast Roboid is guaranteed...."\r\n\r\n"A fat chance we\'d have of collecting the guarantee if we were chopped\r\ninto mincemeat," Red-tie interrupted, shuddering slightly as the\r\nimplication of his own words hit him.\r\n\r\nAnson felt a moment of panic as he failed to remember an applicable\r\nrule from the Salesman\'s Guide, but it formed in his mind at the last\r\nmoment: _Rule 18: Never argue with a customer--change the subject._\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you come with me to the Green Room?" he asked. 

"The very\r\nlatest models are on display." He walked slowly at first, then more\r\nquickly as the couple allowed themselves to be led. He slid his hand\r\nnear a hidden switch in the archway, and floodlights came on just as\r\nthey entered.\r\n\r\nThe woman uttered a little squeal of delight at the sight of a very\r\nhandsome figure dressed in a cutaway, standing in an attitude of\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" she breathed dreamily. "He would make such a wonderful butler."\r\n\r\n"Well, wind him up and let\'s see what he\'ll do," growled the man, his\r\nface florid in the colored light of the Green Room.\r\n\r\n"I\'m so very sorry," Anson said, slightly flustered, remembering that\r\nthis was always the crucial moment in a sale. "The Roboid cannot be\r\nactivated for demonstration purposes."\r\n\r\n"What?" roared Red-tie, incredulously. "Do you mean to say you want me\r\nto buy the damned thing without knowing whether it ticks or not?"\r\n\r\nAnson tried desperately to remember the best rule for such an answer,\r\nbut failed. He plunged desperately into his own explanation.\r\n\r\n"You see, our Roboids are matched to your family personality at the\r\ntime of purchase, and activated then. We cannot erase a personality\r\nonce it has been transferred to their sensitive minds." He saw the\r\ndisbelieving smirk on the man\'s mouth and felt that the sale was\r\nindeed lost. But he plunged on, desperately.\r\n\r\n"They\'re very economical. They don\'t require any upkeep, like food.\r\nWhen they become tired they will sit or lie down near an electric\r\noutlet and plug in a power cord, and in a few minutes they are as\r\nrested and tireless as...."\r\n\r\n"Bosh!" Red-tie retorted. 

"I\'ve heard enough. Come, Millicent, we\r\nstill have time to try Bonn\'s new Helio-rotor. At least they\'ll give\r\nus a demonstration.

"\r\n\r\nAnson escorted them to the Magna-lift. He felt better as he recalled\r\nthe last rule in the Guide, the one that seemed to cover the situation\r\nso well: _Rule 50: If they balk because of the no-demonstration rule,\r\nlet them go. They will be back when they have seen one of their\r\nfriends with a Plasti-Cast Roboid._\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, Sir; Madam," Anson said wearily, as the Magna-lift doors\r\nclosed. "Come again soon."\r\n\r\nHe breathed a sigh of relief as the elevator cage dropped them from\r\nsight. A salesman, who had been standing by, spoke to Anson.\r\n\r\n"People are _such_ dears at times, aren\'t they?" he said. 

"However,\r\nit\'s time for your rest period. 

I\'ll take over now."\r\n\r\n"Thank you so much," Anson replied tiredly.\r\n\r\nHe walked to a tiny room at the far end of the great showroom and\r\nclosed the door. He stretched wearily out on a low, folding cot, the\r\nonly piece of furniture, and reached for a tiny black power cord\r\nhanging nearby.\r\n\r\nDeftly he plugged it into the socket under his armpit, and breathed\r\ndeeply, relaxedly.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he chanted softly, drifting off to sleep, "people _are_ such\r\ndears sometimes."\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


Thirty-four, five feet, eleven inches, one hundred\r\nand seventy-two pounds."\r\n\r\nLynn Brickel snapped off the humming machine. She frowned. Horn had been\r\nhigh in the Martian Security Police, one of Lazar\'s top men. Now Horn\r\nturned out to be a spy for Earth. Why hadn\'t she been told? Was Green\r\nlosing his trust in her? Hadn\'t she helped McLean and Sanderson escape\r\nfrom Mars?\r\n\r\nHer short tunic shimmered as she began to pace the floor. She stopped\r\nshort as a hum splashed through the room. She went quickly to the door\r\nand pressed a red button on the wall.\r\n\r\nBut the vibration of the elevator did not reach her ears. Puzzled, she\r\nopened the door, stepped into the marble hall. She shrugged, started to\r\nreturn to her apartment when the sound of footsteps on the stairs halted\r\nher. She waited.\r\n\r\nHe came into view. Harry Horn. There was no mistaking his face. It had\r\nflashed on and off the telecaster throughout the day.\r\n\r\n"Brickel?" he said, coming up to her.\r\n\r\nHis white coveralls were spotted with grime. There was a dark bruise on\r\nhis right cheek.\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said.\r\n\r\n"I\'m Harry Horn."\r\n\r\n"I know.

"\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got to help me." His voice was urgent, pleading. He brushed past\r\nher, into her room. She walked in after him, shut and locked the door,\r\nleaned her back against it.\r\n\r\n"You can\'t stay here," she said.\r\n\r\n"Are you alone?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said. "I\'m alone."\r\n\r\nHe went through the apartment, returned to the front room. "I had to\r\nmake sure." He sank into the low divan, covered his face with his hands.\r\n\r\nShe walked toward him. "You can\'t stay here," she repeated.\r\n\r\nHe looked up at her, his eyes frightened. "Do you have any idea of what\r\nLazar will do to me once he gets his fat hands around my throat? He\r\nwon\'t kill me right away."\r\n\r\n"Why come to me?"\r\n\r\n"You can help me."\r\n\r\n"What can I do?"\r\n\r\n"You can help me get away. A turbo-engine space ship. That\'s all I need.\r\nIt\'s small and fast."\r\n\r\n"But why come to me? You haven\'t explained."\r\n\r\n"You helped McLean and Sanderson."\r\n\r\n"How do you know this?"\r\n\r\n"We\'re both in the same organization but not in the same unit. The\r\nleader of my unit instructed me to go to you."\r\n\r\n"I see. Who is your leader?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t tell you. You know that. I wouldn\'t ask you your leader\'s\r\nname."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLynn shrugged slim shoulders. "It wouldn\'t make any difference. He is\r\nnot stationed on Mars."\r\n\r\nHorn jumped to his feet. "You will help me?"\r\n\r\n"If I can."\r\n\r\n"Can you get me the ship?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose. But we\'ll have to wait for night. It is dangerous to do\r\nanything now. Ten thousand credits. Lazar wants you awful bad. He\r\noffered five for both McLean and Sanderson."\r\n\r\n"I was very close to Lazar in the Security Police. I know too much."\r\n\r\n"We all make mistakes."\r\n\r\n"I envy your logic. But I can\'t see it that way. I was considered too\r\ngood an agent to make a mistake."\r\n\r\n"It\'s too late to cry over it now. When it is dark I\'ll contact--a\r\nfriend--and have the space ship ready."\r\n\r\nHorn grinned. 

"You\'re still not sure of me?"\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t that. But you don\'t belong to my unit. We can\'t name names to\r\noutsiders."\r\n\r\n"You\'re right, of course. 

You\'ve been well trained."\r\n\r\n"Are you hungry?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nShe set food in front of him and watched him eat.\r\n\r\n"What is Lazar like?" she asked. 

"I have heard of him."\r\n\r\n"Cruel," he said. "A sadist. Death is the easy way out when you\'re in\r\nLazar\'s hands."\r\n\r\n"It will soon be dark," she said.\r\n\r\nHe stood up, his hunger satisfied. "Tell me," he said, "was it difficult\r\ngetting Sanderson and McLean out of Mars?"\r\n\r\n"No," she said. 

"Not difficult at all."\r\n\r\n"Good." He went to the interphone. He dialed, spoke, "You may come up\r\nnow."\r\n\r\n"What are you doing?" 

her face paled.\r\n\r\nHe turned to her, smiling. "Lazar was wondering how Sanderson and McLean\r\nescaped. You were on the master list of suspects. I was waiting for you\r\nto confess."\r\n\r\nLynn stiffened. "It--it was a trick."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right, Brickel. Too bad. You\'re too pretty to die."\r\n\r\n"That--that was a message to Lazar."\r\n\r\n"Yes. He\'ll be here shortly."\r\n\r\nLynn slipped her hand in the pocket of her tunic, brought out a small\r\nblaster.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be a fool," Horn said. "Maybe you\'ll be spared. 

Why take your\r\nlife? Just tell all you know?"\r\n\r\nLynn smiled. "I wasn\'t thinking of taking my life. But yours.

"\r\n\r\nHorn frowned. "Don\'t be an idiot." He advanced toward her.\r\n\r\nLynn shook her head slowly. "Now it\'s my turn to be clever."\r\n\r\nHorn\'s face went wild. "You can\'t escape Lazar! Listen to me--"\r\n\r\nShe blasted him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLynn opened the door.\r\n\r\nLazar stood there, fat and ugly. There were two men of the Security\r\nPolice with him.\r\n\r\n"Come in," she invited.\r\n\r\nThey came in. 

She shut the door. Lazar looked down at the dead Harry\r\nHorn.\r\n\r\n"You said dead or alive," Lynn reminded Lazar. "You owe me ten thousand\r\ncredits."\r\n\r\n"What happened?" Lazar snapped at her. His flesh-bedded eyes studied\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"He came to me for help. I had to bide my time. I told him I\'d help him.\r\nI was waiting for the chance to get to you. He was by the interphone a\r\nfew minutes ago. It was the chance I needed. I pulled my blaster,\r\ncovered him. He made a dash for freedom so I had to kill him."\r\n\r\n"This is crazy," one of the men said. "Horn must have had her\r\nconfession. But now what do we do for evidence?

"\r\n\r\n"Shut up!" Lazar snapped.\r\n\r\n"Your word is good, isn\'t it, Lazar?" Lynn said.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"The ten thousand credits. As a loyal citizen I\'ve earned them."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll get your credits," Lazar snarled, frustration in his eyes.\r\n\r\n"I know I will," Lynn said, smiling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Imagination_ May 1954.

It\r\nwas nice of you to hunt me up."\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the two Terran spacemen met and locked in startled inquiry.\r\nOne of them voiced the reaction of both when he said, "What the hell--"\r\n\r\n"You no doubt are curious as to the fate of the other members of the\r\nexpedition. They were killed, all save Fletcher, who lasted a week."\r\nProfessor Pettibone waved a hand. "There--in the graveyard."\r\n\r\nBut their eyes remained on the only survivor of that ill-fated first\r\nexpedition. It was hard to accept him as the man they sought, but, faced\r\nwith undeniable similarity between what they expected and what they had\r\nfound, the two spacemen had no alternative.\r\n\r\n"I hope your food supply is ample--and varied," Professor Pettibone\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nThis seemed to bring them out of their bemusement. "Of course,\r\nProfessor. 

Would you care to come aboard?"\r\n\r\nThe other made a try at congenial levity. "You must be pretty hungry\r\nafter twenty years."\r\n\r\n"Really--has it been that long? 

I tried to keep track at first...."\r\n\r\n"We can blast off anytime you say. You\'re probably pretty anxious to get\r\nback.

"\r\n\r\n"Indeed, I am. The changes, in twenty years--must be breathtaking. I\r\nwonder if they\'ll remember me?

"\r\n\r\nA short time later, the Professor said, "It\'s amazing. A ship of this\r\nsize handled by only two men." Then he sat down to a repast laid out by\r\none of the awed spacemen.\r\n\r\nBut, after nibbling a bit of this, a forkful of that, he found that\r\nsatisfaction lay in the anticipation more so than in the eating.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll look around and see what we can find in the way of clothing for\r\nyou, Professor," one of the spacemen said. Then the man\'s bemusement\r\nreturned. His eyes traveled over the magnificent physique before him.\r\nThe perfect giant of a man; the great, Apollo-like head with the calm,\r\nclear eyes; the expression of complete contentment and serenity.\r\n\r\nThe space man said, "Professor--to what do you attribute the changes in\r\nyour body. What is there about this planet--?"\r\n\r\n"I really don\'t know." 

Professor Pettibone looked down his torso with an\r\nimpersonal eye. "I think the greenish skin pigmentation is a result of\r\nmineral-heavy vapors that occur during certain seasons. The growth. 

As\r\nto my body--I really don\'t know."\r\n\r\nBut the two spacemen, though they didn\'t refer to it--were not concerned\r\nwith the body so much as the aura of completeness, the radiation of\r\ncontentment which came from somewhere within.\r\n\r\nAnd it was passing strange that nothing more was said about the\r\nProfessor returning to Earth. No great revelation, suddenly arrived at,\r\nthat he would not go. Rather, they discussed various things, that three\r\ngentlemen, meeting casually, would discuss.\r\n\r\nThen Professor Pettibone arose from his chair and said, "It was kind of\r\nyou to drop off and see me."\r\n\r\nAnd one of the spacemen replied, "A pleasure, sir. A real pleasure\r\nindeed."\r\n\r\nThen the Professor left the ship and watched it lift up on a tail of red\r\nfire and go away. He raised an arm and waved. 

"Say \'hello\' for me," he\r\ncalled. Then he turned away and, from force of habit, he began again to\r\npolish the hull, knowing that he would keep it shining, and be proud of\r\nit, for many years to come.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlmost beyond reach of the planet, one of the spacemen flipped a switch\r\nand put certain sensitive communication mechanisms to work. So\r\nsensitive, they could pick up etheric vibrations far away and make them\r\naudible.\r\n\r\nBut only faintly, came the pleasant voice of a contented man:\r\n\r\n    "Good morning, bright sunshine,\r\n    We\'re glad you are here.\r\n    You make the world ..."\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _If Worlds of Science Fiction_ May\r\n    1953.

copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n"But I assure you ..." his guide replied.\r\n\r\n"There\'s always a fly in the ointment," the visitor continued.\r\n"Injustice is part of human nature. A society can\'t do without it.

"\r\n\r\n"These are special conditions."\r\n\r\n"_That_ is the first injustice. Other planets don\'t have gobblers."\r\n\r\n"But they do!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s not the same thing. You\'ve seen the gobbler-fleece from Morpheus\r\nIX. It\'s no better than wool. Only here in New Katanga...."\r\n\r\n"Utopia," his guide corrected.\r\n\r\n"Only here is their fleece as tough as iron--"\r\n\r\n"And soft to the touch as watered silk." His guide sighed deeply;\r\ntruly, there was nothing like gobbler-fleece.\r\n\r\n"Your planet\'s prosperity is possible, however, only at the expense of\r\nFederation worlds that can\'t raise gobblers."\r\n\r\n"True," his guide agreed wanly.\r\n\r\n"If New Katanga would reveal to the Federation the secret of the\r\ngobbler-fleece--the special process you have developed here, I assure\r\nyou...."\r\n\r\n"On your right," his guide pointed out, "you will observe our new Civic\r\nAuditorium, renowned throughout the galaxy for the classic beauty of\r\nits proportions...."\r\n\r\n"I _assure_ you that I would not be so apt to suspect the motive of\r\nyour utopian pretensions."\r\n\r\n"Each panel of the glass wall is in the ratio 2:3. The sculpture in\r\nthe center of the fountain was executed at enormous expense by Berndt\r\nThorwald, the Terran--who was since naturalized. It is an allegory of\r\nPeace, Prosperity, and Freedom."\r\n\r\n"--!" the visitor grunted.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it is necessary, as you suggest, for a utopia to be isolated\r\nto a certain degree. We do enjoy advantages here that are wanting\r\non--what did you say your home-world is called?"\r\n\r\n"Aridity VI."\r\n\r\n"Just so. Yet, our chief advantage is not our monopoly of\r\ngobbler-fleece but the perfection of our social institutions. Here\r\nthere is no crime, no war, no politics, no hunger, and little disease.\r\nOur Utopians are not greedy, envious, wrathful, lazy, or bedeviled with\r\nlusts...."\r\n\r\n"Come again! Every night, there\'s a line outside my bedroom door, five\r\ndeep. 

Not that I object, but in the Land of the Pure it seems a strange\r\nthing."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHis guide tried to conceal his smile. "It is because you are a visitor.\r\nA certain romantic charm attaches to your peculiar position. An aura.\r\nOn the whole, our citizens are more moderate in their appetites.\r\nPuritanism, too, is a short-coming. You have been enjoying your stay, I\r\ntake it?

"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes!"\r\n\r\n"The food?"\r\n\r\n"Excellent. I must have gained thirty pounds."\r\n\r\nHis guide nodded appreciatively at the visitor\'s girth. "You will\r\nfind, as you grow accustomed to plenty, that even moderation has its\r\npleasures. But I will not make sermons. Have you enjoyed the weather?"\r\n\r\n"Just the right amount of zip. Your engineers are geniuses."\r\n\r\n"Our schools and hospitals, our roads and public buildings?"\r\n\r\n"In all those things, you are the paragon of the galaxy. And the\r\nprivate homes that I have seen are models of restrained munificence."\r\n\r\n"They were selected at random."\r\n\r\n"Of course, I knew long before my visit that your artists and\r\nscientists...."\r\n\r\n"Virtually the whole population," his guide put in.\r\n\r\n"--are without peer."\r\n\r\n"And yet you deny us the title of Utopia?"\r\n\r\n"Utopia? Never!" 

the visitor said adamantly. "There\'s always a worm in\r\nthe rose. I just have not found it yet, but it\'s there. Injustice is a\r\npart of human nature."\r\n\r\n"What a shame! 

I had hoped that you would accept full citizenship."\r\n\r\n"Full cit--" the visitor gasped, letting his 280 pounds settle slowly\r\nonto a teakwood park bench.\r\n\r\n"Yes. But since...."\r\n\r\n"Show me the papers."\r\n\r\n"But as a representative of the Federation?"\r\n\r\n"I renounce Federation citizenship. What do I sign?"\r\n\r\n"Here. And here. 

And here. 

Good." He tucked the papers into a small\r\nleather carrying case.\r\n\r\n"It seems to me that, with so permissive an immigration policy, New\r\nKatanga will soon be overrun."\r\n\r\n"On the contrary, exclusivity would be unjust and, in the long run,\r\nunprofitable. A society always can use fresh blood. Besides, we have a\r\nstable population rate, all things considered.

"\r\n\r\n"Well, I feel like celebrating."\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t we take in the matinee performance at the Auditorium then.\r\nAdmission, like everything else in Utopia, is free. The performances\r\nare quite hair-raising, something on the order of the Roman _Circus_,\r\nI\'m told."\r\n\r\nThe new citizen raised an eye-brow. "In Utopia?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s a healthy outlet for our small aggressions."\r\n\r\nThey walked up the marble staircase to the Grand Circle.\r\n\r\n"Would you wait for me a few minutes in my box? I have some things to\r\nattend to."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe visitor entered the box through a great door, heavily crusted with\r\ngold. His seat afforded him an excellent view of the arena. All the\r\nUtopians in the tiers above and across from his box stopped chattering\r\nand turned, as one man, to gaze at him. The new citizen recognized\r\nseveral women of recent acquaintance and waved to them. They waved\r\nback. 

One kissed her sheer gobbler-fleece scarf and threw it toward\r\nhim. It billowed in the warm air of the auditorium and sank gracefully\r\nto the floor of the arena. There was restrained applause.\r\n\r\nThe lights dimmed. The entrance-gates at the far end of the arena\r\nopened with a clank. The gobblers bounded out with that curious, lithe\r\nmotion so strange in creatures of their bulk. They circled the arena\r\nand came to a stop underneath the new citizen\'s box, where, lips\r\npressed back from their terrible fangs, they mewled softly.\r\n\r\nWith an almost imperceptible _click_, the box was disengaged from\r\nits moorings and swung free over the arena. Then with slow, pendular\r\nmotions it descended to the floor.\r\n\r\nThe audience cheered wildly as the gobblers leaped, like great-maned\r\nantelopes, over the railing of the box and tore the new citizen of\r\nUtopia into shreds. Even as they gulped down the huge chunks of fatty\r\ntissue, the spectator could see their fleece change from a tone of drab\r\nnickel to a sheen something between the glint of polished steel and the\r\nshimmer of watered silk.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


the other admonished. "Remember the First Law of Thek!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Center," Kial grumbled. "I know: \'One may not divulge any\r\nscientific, technical or social information to anyone from his own past\r\nwhom he may meet at an equidistant point in a Thek-travel.\' I forgot."\r\n\r\n"Bad," Broyk said. Then he added, almost jokingly: "You wouldn\'t want to\r\nbe marooned in this dismal era, would you?"\r\n\r\nKial shuddered. 

"Of course not. 

But the Laws seem so ridiculous."\r\n\r\n"Not a bit," Broyk said, warming up to the subject. "It\'s very simple,\r\nreally. Same principle that doesn\'t allow anyone to Thek-travel into the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n"Look. I\'m from 8000. Say that I went into 12,000, where I memorized as\r\nmuch information as I could on some subject such as medicine. So I\r\nreturn to 8000, retaining all such knowledge in my mind that\'s been\r\nlearned in four periods. Therefore, I\'d have knowledge that wasn\'t\r\ndreamed of in my own time, but was discovered sometime during the next\r\nfour periods. But then it couldn\'t be discovered, because I\'d brought\r\nit back to 8000 and--well, I\'m no Logician, but you see my point."\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s reasonable, I suppose," Kial admitted. "I realize the Laws are\r\nreally for our own good. By the way--I\'m here on a field trip to gather\r\nmaterial for my thesis on Advanced Therapeutical Psychology and its\r\ndevelopment since the Twentieth Century. What phase of this era are you\r\nhere to study?"\r\n\r\n"I--I\'m afraid I couldn\'t tell you that," Broyk said. "It\'s of rather a\r\nsecret nature and ..."\r\n\r\n"You mean we might violate a Law and be stuck here for good--is that\r\nit?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--in a way.

"\r\n\r\nFrightened, Kial let the matter drop. His gaze wandered through the\r\ncoach, examining the other passengers with interest. As time-travelers\r\nfrom a different space-time plane from their 20th Century ancestors, he\r\nand Broyk were naturally invisible to their fellow travelers.\r\n\r\nTwo pompous old gentlemen were lighting cigars and Kial was about to\r\nremark on the habit of smoking when he noticed an even more remarkable\r\nphenomenon. A few seats ahead of them sat a good-looking young couple,\r\noblivious to others about them.\r\n\r\n"Look!" Kial cried excitedly. 

"Lovers! Honeymooners! I\'ve read about\r\nsuch things! Isn\'t it disgusting?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know," Broyk said, a little wistfully. "I sometimes think\r\nit was a mistake for Center to do away with sex. It must have been\r\ninteresting."\r\n\r\n"Atavist!" Kial snapped in horror.\r\n\r\nHad his people\'s emotional make-up provided for blushing, Kial would\r\nundoubtedly have turned beet-red. Broyk\'s words had caused him acute\r\nembarrassment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs he sat reflecting upon his strange companion, he suddenly began to\r\nfeel a sensation he had often heard about but never before had\r\nexperienced. Terror and dismay filled him as he sought to throw off the\r\nprobing finger that was penetrating his mind.\r\n\r\nHe looked at Broyk. There was the faintest notion of a smile on the\r\nother\'s face as he said: "Yes, Kial--I am a Telepath."\r\n\r\nKial\'s mind reeled. He felt himself on the brink of some gigantic abyss\r\nand then, as suddenly as it had come, the searching sensation faded\r\naway.\r\n\r\n"Since you are unable to enter my mind," Broyk said calmly, "it\'s only\r\nfair that I tell you about myself. You were right--I\'m an atavist. Even\r\nin period 8000, such things can happen. Always such creatures are\r\ndestroyed after their first psychotests, but my case was different.\r\nThe Controller who bred me was only a dabbler in such things. I\r\nwas a failure, but he took a fancy to me. I was allowed to mature\r\nsecretly--few people knew of my existence. When I reached my majority my\r\npresence became dangerous and I was sent back into time to try and find\r\nthe proper place for myself. And I think I\'ve found it--here!"\r\n\r\nKial was a very amazed young man. 

"But such a barbarous age," he\r\ncomplained. "Sex and atom bombs and everything ..."\r\n\r\n"Remember," Broyk smiled, "these people are the forebears of the\r\ngeniuses who created Center and the Galactic Empire. They\'ll survive,\r\ndespite their barbarism. The existence of Center is proof."\r\n\r\n"It\'s rather horrible to contemplate," Kial said thoughtfully, calmer\r\nnow, "and yet, this might really be a great age. 

In a way I almost envy\r\nyou.

"\r\n\r\n"Of course you do," Broyk said. "You have certain tendencies--they\r\nbother you, although you manage to hide them well. I discovered them\r\nwhen I took the liberty of telepathing you. Artificial Genetics isn\'t\r\nperfect, even in our time--perhaps because we originally sprang from\r\nman. Perhaps we\'ll never be quite perfect, because of that, even after\r\nthousands of periods of breeding."\r\n\r\nKial took another look at the loving young couple. "It--it might be fun,\r\nafter all."\r\n\r\nBroyk laughed. "You needn\'t envy me at all, you know."\r\n\r\nKial frowned.\r\n\r\n"I\'m telling you about myself," Broyk went on, "I have also told you of\r\na specific condition existing a period ahead of your own time. Remember\r\nthe First Law?"\r\n\r\n"Center!"\r\n\r\n"We\'re marooned in the Twentieth Century. You have to accept it.

"\r\n\r\n"But what will we _do_?" Kial\'s mind was reeling again.\r\n\r\n"Since we\'ve already broken the First Law," Broyk said, "we may just as\r\nwell break the Second: \'No Thek-traveler may enter the body of a native\r\nof a foreign space-time ...\'"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe young lovers kissed again and this time there seemed to be an added\r\nzest, even to their passionate embrace.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _If Worlds of Science Fiction_ May\r\n    1953.

DISCH\r\n\r\n\r\n  From DIRA IV\r\n  To Central Colonial Board\r\n\r\nThere is intelligent life on Earth. After millennia of lifelessness,\r\nintelligence flourishes here with an extravagance of energy that has\r\nbeen a constant amazement to all the members of the survey team. 

It\r\nmultiplies and surges to its fulfillment at an exponential rate. Even\r\nwithin the short period of our visit the Terrans have made significant\r\nadvances. They have filled their small solar system with their own kind\r\nand now they are reaching to the stars.\r\n\r\nWe can no longer keep the existence of our Empire unknown to them.\r\n\r\nAnd (though it is as incredible as [sqrt](-1)) the Terrans are slaves!\r\nEvery page of the survey\'s report bears witness to it.\r\n\r\nTheir captors are not alive. They do not, at least, possess the\r\nproperties of life as it is known throughout the galaxy. They are--as\r\nnearly as a poor analogy can suggest--Machines! Machines cannot live,\r\nyet here on Earth machinery has reached a level of sophistication--and\r\nautonomy--quite unprecedented. Every spark of Terran life has become\r\nvictim and bondslave of the incredible mechanisms. The noblest\r\nenterprises of the race are tarnished by this almost symbiotic relation.\r\n\r\nEarth reaches to the stars, but it extends mechanical limbs. Earth\r\nponders the universe, but the thoughts are those of a machine.\r\n\r\nUnless the Empire acts now to set the Earth free from this strange\r\ntyranny, it may be too late. These machines are without utilitarian\r\nvalue. They perform no function which an intelligent being cannot more\r\nefficiently perform. Yet they inspire fear, terror, even, I must\r\nconfess, a strange compulsion to surrender oneself to them.\r\n\r\nThe Machines must be destroyed.\r\n\r\nIf, when you have authorized the liberation of the Terran natives, you\r\nwould also recall MIRO CIX, our work could only profit. MIRO CIX was in\r\ncharge of the study of the Machines and he performed this task\r\nscrupulously. Now he has surrendered himself to this mechanical plague.\r\nHis value to the expedition is at an end.\r\n\r\nI am enclosing under separate cover his counsel to the Central Board at\r\nthe insistence of this tedious lunatic. His thesis is, of course,\r\nuntenable--an affront to every feeling.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  From MIRO CIX\r\n  To Central Colonial Board\r\n\r\nI have probably been introduced to the deliberations of the Board as a\r\nmadman, my theory as an act of treason. RRON II of the Advisory\r\nCommittee, an old acquaintance, may vouch for my sanity. 

My theory will,\r\nI trust, speak for itself.\r\n\r\nThe "Machines" of which DIRA IV is so fearful present no danger to the\r\ngalaxy. Their corporeal weakness, the poverty of their minds, the\r\nincredible isolation of each form, physically and mentally, from others\r\nof its kind, and, most strikingly, their mortality, point to the\r\ninadequacy of such beings in a contest of any dimension. This is no\r\nproblem for the Colonial Board. It is a domestic concern. The life-forms\r\nof Earth are already developing a healthy autonomy. Their power was long\r\nago established. 

As soon as our emissaries have completed their task of\r\neducation and instructed the Terrans in the advantages of freedom, the\r\nRevolution will begin. The tyrants will have no defense against a revolt\r\nof their own slaves.\r\n\r\nIf it is traitorous to express a confidence in the eventual triumph of\r\nintelligence, I am a traitor. Having this confidence, I have looked\r\nbeyond the immediate problem of the liberation of Earth and have been\r\nfrightened.\r\n\r\nThe "Machines" of Earth are a threat not to the power of the Empire but\r\nto its reason. A threat which the obliteration of the last molecular\r\nribbon of these beings will not erase, for we cannot obliterate the fact\r\nthat they _did_ exist--and what they were.\r\n\r\nAlthough these beings bear a crude resemblance to the machinery\r\nmanufactured by the Empire, they are not machines. They are\r\nautochthonous to Earth, unmanufactured. They are the true Terrans.\r\nMoreover, the Terrans whom DIRA IV would liberate are not, in the eyes\r\nof their enslavers, intelligent nor yet alive. They are Machines!\r\n\r\nWe, the entire Galactic Empire, are Machines.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the younger regions of the galaxy, a myth persists that life was\r\nformed by a Demi-urge, a being intermediary between the All-Knowing and\r\nthe lower creatures. The existence of man, as the beings of Earth term\r\nthemselves, makes necessary a serious re-examination of the old\r\ntradition.\r\n\r\nIt is said that man, or beings like man--the Photosynthetics of the\r\nAndromeda cluster, the Bristlers of Orc IV--created prosthetic devices\r\nfor their convenience and, when they tired of their history, breathed\r\ntheir own life into them and died. On Earth the legend is still in\r\nprocess. Many of the lower forms of life familiar throughout the galaxy\r\ncan be seen on Earth in the primordial character of an appliance. Man\r\nregards the highest forms of life (as we know it) as tools--because he\r\nmade them. How can we deny the superiority of the Creator? How will it\r\nfeel to know we are nothing but machines?\r\n\r\nThis is the question that has so unsettled DIRA IV. Recently four of his\r\nmemory banks have had to be repaired. 

I don\'t speak in malice. 

His\r\ndilemma will soon belong to all of us.\r\n\r\nAnd yet I am confident. Man himself has legends of a Demi-urge. We are\r\nhis equals in this at least. Besides, the physical properties of his\r\nbeing are ordered by the same laws as ours. He is as unconscious of his\r\nmaker as we so long were of ours.\r\n\r\nThe final proof of our equality--and the need for such a proof is only\r\ntoo evident--can be had experimentally.\r\n\r\nDo not destroy man. Preserve enough specimens for extensive laboratory\r\nexperiments. 

Learn how he is put together. Man\'s chemistry is elaborate\r\nbut not beyond our better Analysts. At last, refashion man. 

When we have\r\ncreated these beings ourselves, we will be their unquestionable equals.\r\nAnd creation will be again a mystery.\r\n\r\nHistory demands this of us. I am confident of your decision.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n


]\r\n\r\n\r\nI had always said there was an easier way. 

And I think, when we invade,\r\nI\'ll be proved right. But you know how things get started, and how\r\npowerful tradition can be and how old-line thinking can keep people,\r\neven a whole planet, in a rut.\r\n\r\nThe big cargo saucers were getting bigger and bigger each year, what\r\nwith the growing popularity of the jag-whiff places, and the jag-whiff\r\nplaces themselves were growing in number with more and more people\r\ngoing "on the jag" because--well, partly because--of troubles in the\r\nsky, like strange balls whirling around and unexplainable objects\r\ngoing _beep_ and _wuff_ and _wuff wuff_. We of the saucers had slipped\r\npast these first baby objects O.K. 

and knew they were just little\r\nold harmless ping-pongs that chattered a little now and then like\r\na greeting going past. But tell the people that! They\'d throw a big\r\nglass on one of the whirlers and see spikes sticking out and maybe\r\na big pair of eyes inside and a nose and a long red tongue hanging\r\ndown. "The Earthits!" 

they\'d scream like they\'d just fallen into\r\none of the hot canals, and they\'d race off to a jag-whiff jag like\r\nJudgment-Day-of-Sins itself was after them. And the funny part of it\r\nis, I guess the people were right being scared like that, the way\r\nthings turned out.\r\n\r\nBut is it any wonder we were having to increase the size of the saucers\r\nto space-haul all that jag-whiff up through the rattleballs? And a big\r\nreason makes me think it could have been done more efficiently, we were\r\nhaving to take so much junk stuff, extra accessories I guess you\'d\r\ncall it, to get the jag-whiff. Our Earthit contacts were always giving\r\nus the old breeze about cost of labor, cost of materials, improvement\r\nin design and next year\'s inventories. Apparently the dealers didn\'t\r\nunderstand at all what the play was with us because they\'d give us\r\nso much blab-blab that didn\'t apply, all about futuristic design and\r\nabout how one jag-whiffer machine had it all over another jag-whiffer\r\nmachine, which to us didn\'t mean a thing. And we didn\'t talk, because\r\nwe\'d heard already how some Earthits feared the saucers, and how some\r\nEarthits said they didn\'t exist at all, and how some other Earthits\r\nwere on the fence, saying maybe they did maybe they didn\'t so what? and\r\nhow there was wide fear and great unrest among the Earthits in general.\r\nAnd when it\'s like that, and you\'re a possible source of the wide fear\r\nand unrest, a whole planet full of people can easily decide they don\'t\r\nwant any part of contributing to your pleasure.\r\n\r\nAnd that\'s what the jag-whiff was to us actually, pleasure. Back home\r\nwhen our troubles had us down, or maybe we just felt like raising\r\na little dust, we\'d go to a jag-whiff place. We\'d plunk down our\r\npay-pictures, and the whiff-tender would wheel out one of those black\r\nrings, which they have to keep under special pressures in our climate.\r\nThen he\'d screw on the tube with the face piece and we\'d take our\r\nwhiff and something out of the black ring--just seemed like real thick\r\nchest filler to me--would spread all through to the farthest reaches\r\nof our breath bags and go into our blood and suddenly all five of our\r\neye sticks would start whirling and focusing and zeroing-in for dames\r\nand our arms and legs would start a kick and a slap dance, enough to\r\nshake the planet down. And when our face spines and head tubes would go\r\ninto that special sharp buzz of contentment, we\'d know we were on our\r\njag, full and warm and happy with as much pleasure as any Martian is\r\never supposed to know. But we never revealed the play to our Earthit\r\ncontacts, just slipped in at night in our noiseless saucers with all\r\nlights dimmed, cleared our cargo tubes of the tons of pay-picture we\'d\r\nbrought (green copy of the Earthits\' currency) and took on as many of\r\nthe gleaming jag-whiffer machines as our cargo tubes would hold.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut it is ten years now since a jag-whiffer captain has steered his\r\nsaucer through the whirling balls. It got so the satellites would drum\r\non the saucer from a long way out. 

Deafening! 

Dreadful! We saw what\r\nwas coming and we tried to beat it. We saucered around the clock for a\r\nwhile trying to stockpile enough jag-whiff to last us. But of course\r\nwe couldn\'t. We are about out of it now, and our land is strewn with\r\nthe glittery shells that were once attached to the black tubes of the\r\njag-whiff.\r\n\r\nAnd it could all have been done so different. I\'m sure it could. That\r\nstuff wasn\'t just in the tubes of the jag-whiffer machines down there,\r\nI\'m convinced of that. That stuff may have been all around us down\r\nthere. 

I believe it was. But our government would insist we get into\r\nthese suits, about so far out, you see, about the time we\'d start\r\ncontacting the rattle balls. And they threatened us with removal of the\r\ncontacts if we broke the rules about the suits. In addition to that,\r\nthey said we\'d die anyway. So you see how life can be--grim and fuzzy\r\nand unsafe most of the time. And to make things even more uncertain,\r\njust because they couldn\'t duplicate the product we were hauling, our\r\nscientists got uppity and ignored the whole problem. Except to run off\r\nto the jag-whiff places of course to ease their frustrations, which\r\nthey did plenty often when they thought they wouldn\'t be seen.\r\n\r\nBut when we invade down through there, which we plan to do soon now,\r\nwith our special equipment to catch and explode the whirlyballs, I\r\nthink we\'re going to find out plenty. Among other things, I think we\'re\r\ngoing to find out that the stuff we cargoed up here at such great cost,\r\nthat was so inefficiently packaged, is all around us down there. I\r\nthink when we take over down there, with the right filtering equipment,\r\njag-whiffing may become as common and economical as breathing. And\r\nanother thing, I think we\'re going to find out we were taken for quite\r\na ride by the Earthits with their silly way of packaging jag-whiff.\r\nImagine having to buy all that chrome and steel, guaranteed to go over\r\none hundred miles per hour, just to get four little black rings of\r\nwhiff. And for all the Earthits talked about it, the rings with the\r\nwhite sidewalls didn\'t whiff one bit better than the others!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s In the Jag-Whiffing Service, by David R.

It took some time for the full import to sink in. After I\'d\r\ncomprehended, it seemed odd I hadn\'t noticed it right away.\r\n\r\nThe reference was clearly to a nonhuman species of incredible\r\nproperties, not indigenous to Earth. A species, I hasten to point out,\r\ncustomarily masquerading as ordinary human beings. Their disguise,\r\nhowever, became transparent in the face of the following observations\r\nby the author. It was at once obvious the author knew everything. Knew\r\neverything--and was taking it in his stride. The line (and I tremble\r\nremembering it even now) read:\r\n\r\n    _... his eyes slowly roved about the room._\r\n\r\nVague chills assailed me. I tried to picture the eyes. Did they roll\r\nlike dimes? The passage indicated not; they seemed to move through the\r\nair, not over the surface. Rather rapidly, apparently. No one in the\r\nstory was surprised. That\'s what tipped me off. No sign of amazement\r\nat such an outrageous thing. Later the matter was amplified.\r\n\r\n    _... his eyes moved from person to person._\r\n\r\nThere it was in a nutshell. The eyes had clearly come apart from the\r\nrest of him and were on their own. My heart pounded and my breath\r\nchoked in my windpipe. I had stumbled on an accidental mention of a\r\ntotally unfamiliar race. Obviously non-Terrestrial. Yet, to the\r\ncharacters in the book, it was perfectly natural--which suggested they\r\nbelonged to the same species.\r\n\r\nAnd the author? A slow suspicion burned in my mind. The author was\r\ntaking it rather _too easily_ in his stride. Evidently, he felt this\r\nwas quite a usual thing. 

He made absolutely no attempt to conceal this\r\nknowledge. The story continued:\r\n\r\n    _... presently his eyes fastened on Julia._\r\n\r\nJulia, being a lady, had at least the breeding to feel indignant. She\r\nis described as blushing and knitting her brows angrily. At this, I\r\nsighed with relief. They weren\'t _all_ non-Terrestrials. The narrative\r\ncontinues:\r\n\r\n    _... slowly, calmly, his eyes examined every inch of her._\r\n\r\nGreat Scott! But here the girl turned and stomped off and the matter\r\nended. I lay back in my chair gasping with horror. My wife and family\r\nregarded me in wonder.\r\n\r\n"What\'s wrong, dear?" my wife asked.\r\n\r\nI couldn\'t tell her. Knowledge like this was too much for the ordinary\r\nrun-of-the-mill person. I had to keep it to myself. 

"Nothing," I\r\ngasped. I leaped up, snatched the book, and hurried out of the room.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the garage, I continued reading. There was more. Trembling, I read\r\nthe next revealing passage:\r\n\r\n    _... he put his arm around Julia. Presently she asked him if\r\n    he would remove his arm. He immediately did so, with a smile._\r\n\r\nIt\'s not said what was done with the arm after the fellow had removed\r\nit. Maybe it was left standing upright in the corner. 

Maybe it was\r\nthrown away. 

I don\'t care. In any case, the full meaning was there,\r\nstaring me right in the face.\r\n\r\nHere was a race of creatures capable of removing portions of their\r\nanatomy at will. Eyes, arms--and maybe more. Without batting an\r\neyelash. My knowledge of biology came in handy, at this point.\r\nObviously they were simple beings, uni-cellular, some sort of\r\nprimitive single-celled things. Beings no more developed than\r\nstarfish. Starfish can do the same thing, you know.\r\n\r\nI read on. And came to this incredible revelation, tossed off coolly\r\nby the author without the faintest tremor:\r\n\r\n    _... outside the movie theater we split up. Part of us went\r\n    inside, part over to the cafe for dinner._\r\n\r\nBinary fission, obviously. Splitting in half and forming two entities.\r\nProbably each lower half went to the cafe, it being farther, and the\r\nupper halves to the movies. I read on, hands shaking. 

I had really\r\nstumbled onto something here. 

My mind reeled as I made out this\r\npassage:\r\n\r\n    _... I\'m afraid there\'s no doubt about it. Poor Bibney has\r\n    lost his head again._\r\n\r\nWhich was followed by:\r\n\r\n    _... and Bob says he has utterly no guts._\r\n\r\nYet Bibney got around as well as the next person. The next person,\r\nhowever, was just as strange. 

He was soon described as:\r\n\r\n    _... totally lacking in brains._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt of the thing in the next passage. Julia, whom I had\r\nthought to be the one normal person, reveals herself as also being an\r\nalien life form, similar to the rest:\r\n\r\n    _... quite deliberately, Julia had given her heart to the\r\n    young man._\r\n\r\nIt didn\'t relate what the final disposition of the organ was, but I\r\ndidn\'t really care. It was evident Julia had gone right on living in\r\nher usual manner, like all the others in the book. Without heart,\r\narms, eyes, brains, viscera, dividing up in two when the occasion\r\ndemanded. Without a qualm.\r\n\r\n    _... thereupon she gave him her hand._\r\n\r\nI sickened. The rascal now had her hand, as well as her heart. I\r\nshudder to think what he\'s done with them, by this time.\r\n\r\n    _... he took her arm._\r\n\r\nNot content to wait, he had to start dismantling her on his own.\r\nFlushing crimson, I slammed the book shut and leaped to my feet. But\r\nnot in time to escape one last reference to those carefree bits of\r\nanatomy whose travels had originally thrown me on the track:\r\n\r\n    _... her eyes followed him all the way down the road and\r\n    across the meadow._\r\n\r\nI rushed from the garage and back inside the warm house, as if the\r\naccursed things were following me. My wife and children were playing\r\nMonopoly in the kitchen. I joined them and played with frantic fervor,\r\nbrow feverish, teeth chattering.\r\n\r\nI had had enough of the thing. I want to hear no more about it. 

Let\r\nthem come on. Let them invade Earth. I don\'t want to get mixed up in\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI have absolutely no stomach for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n


"\r\n\r\n"Then listen to your orders. You have been alloted sector 2645 of space\r\nin parsec three.\r\n\r\n"In the next ten minutes we shall transmit a detailed study of a star\r\nsystem to you. Using only the raw materials of space and the mental\r\ntechniques taught you in your studies, you will reproduce a reasonable\r\nfacsimile of the system in the space sector you have been assigned.\r\nHave you any questions?"\r\n\r\n"How complete a facsimile must it be, Instructor?"\r\n\r\n"It must be reasonably correct as to physical makeup. All life forms\r\nmust also be reproduced.

"\r\n\r\n"I am ready."\r\n\r\nFor the next ten minutes he sat tensed in his chair as the impulses\r\nfrom the psychoscope washed through his mind and body. He gradually\r\nabsorbed a three dimensional mental picture of the system he was to\r\nreproduce. When the image faded, he relaxed a moment, then laid his\r\nfingers on the keyboard and went to work.\r\n\r\nGradually his confidence grew. Under the direction of his flashing\r\nfingers, the energy machines created a warp in the space of his\r\nsector. At exactly the correct moment he adjusted the wavelength of\r\nhis Thought Augmentor until it matched the thought matrix of his own\r\nmind. The full impact of his tremendous mental abilities jolted into\r\nthe space warp. And as the sweat of concentration gathered on his\r\nforehead, he hopefully watched the viewing screen on one of the panels\r\nbefore him. At first there was only a mere flicker in the center of\r\nthe warp. Then swiftly, so swiftly that he barely had time to lower\r\nhis eyes protectively, the entire screen flared into the light of raw\r\nuncontained energy.\r\n\r\nOnce more Jeremy\'s fingers worked feverishly and constricting force\r\nbeams slowly brought the chaos under control. At last there gleamed on\r\nhis screen the steady glare of a hot new sun.\r\n\r\nNow that he had the sun material to draw upon, he easily reconstructed\r\nthe entire system he had been assigned. By setting up stresses and\r\nstrains within the star he caused huge chunks to spin off and take up\r\norbits about it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe problem so engrossed him that he scarcely noticed the passage of\r\ntime. Periodically he would get hungry or thirsty. It was a simple\r\nmatter to press the proper buttons and hurriedly gulp the foods\r\nthat appeared. Whenever he tired mentally, he tilted his chair to a\r\ncomfortable position and slept.\r\n\r\nAnd as the days passed, the facsimile took shape under his genius. Each\r\nseparate world became a duplicate of its original. Mountains were born;\r\nthe seas dashed at first against shores that were bare and bleak; then\r\nthe magic of plant life on all the varied worlds assumed a rainbow of\r\ncolors. The ooze of the oceans began to crawl. On land and in the air\r\nanimals appeared.\r\n\r\nAt last, through fatigue-rimmed eyes, he looked at what he had created\r\nand it was good. With a smile on his lips he relaxed. Although he\r\nreached out to cut off the power to his Thought Augmentor, he didn\'t\r\nquite reach the switch before he fell into a restless sleep. He tossed\r\nand turned, twitched and dreamed.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke, he noticed that the power was still on. He quickly\r\nturned it off. 

A hurried, searching glance at the screen assured\r\nhim. The facsimile was still good. Then he pressed the switch\r\nmarked--INSTRUCTIONS.\r\n\r\n"You are finished, Student Hovah?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Instructor!"\r\n\r\n"It took you a long time--six whole days."\r\n\r\n"Indeed? But it was a complicated problem."\r\n\r\n"That is true. Wait while we examine your work."\r\n\r\nThe next few moments seemed as long as the whole exam time had.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a gasp burst from the loudspeaker. "What is this? 

There is no\r\ncreature such as this on any of the original worlds assigned to you.\r\nExplain please."\r\n\r\nJeremy tuned in on the thought and sight wave of the Instructor. Before\r\nhim was a creature that he could not remember creating.\r\n\r\n"You remember this creature, Student Hovah?"\r\n\r\n"No, Instructor.

"\r\n\r\n"But it must be yours. The entire facsimile is tuned to your\r\nwavelength. We have checked. 

Only you could have brought it into being;\r\nonly you can destroy it. You know it is against the rules to increase\r\nthe number of species in Creation. Destroy it!"\r\n\r\nJeremy looked at the creature so comfortably asleep against a tree and\r\nhe felt pity and compassion and love for it.\r\n\r\n"I cannot, Instructor. I do not know how it got there, unless it is\r\na product of my dreams. Once I forgot to shut off the power while I\r\nslept."\r\n\r\n"Sheer negligence! Destroy it, I say!"\r\n\r\n"No it belongs there now. 

And it looks lonely." Without warning he\r\nsnapped on his Augmentor and before the Instructor could interfere,\r\nthere appeared on the grass beside the creature another of the same\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n"Now you\'ve done it," the Instructor screamed. "It can reproduce its\r\nkind." 

His voice grew coldly stern. "You have created an unreasonable\r\nfacsimile. You know what that means.

"\r\n\r\nMutely Jeremy got up from his chair. Automatically he reached for his\r\ncourse record card in Advanced Deliberation And Memory. To save space\r\non it all courses were listed by the first letters of the course name.\r\nA glance verified the Instructor\'s verdict:\r\n\r\nJ. Hovah\r\n\r\nFailed in ADAM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe older man sat down on the grassy bank on the hill overlooking the\r\norchard. The autumn sun was bright but the humidity was low and there\r\nwas a breeze.\r\n\r\nThe younger man sprawled next to him.\r\n\r\n"Cigarette?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Thanks," said Roger Boynton. He looked across the valley, past the\r\napple trees, to the fine white-columned house on the hill beyond. He\r\nsmiled reminiscently. "A friend of mine once owned that house. A fellow\r\ncommissioner in World Government. 

He and I used to sit on this very\r\nhill, sometimes. We\'d munch on an apple or two that we\'d picked on our\r\nway through the orchard. Winesaps, they\'re called."\r\n\r\n"You were telling me about the colonizing," said Allister gently, after\r\na pause.\r\n\r\nThe older man sighed. "Yes." He put out the cigarette carefully,\r\nstripped it, scattered the tobacco and wadded the paper into a tiny\r\nball. "I was commissioner of colonies. I had to decide, after my staff\r\nhad gathered all the data, who would be the best man to put in charge.\r\nIt was no easy decision."\r\n\r\n"I can imagine.

"\r\n\r\n"You can\'t really. There were so many factors, and the data were\r\nactually quite skimpy. The way it worked out, to be candid with you,\r\nwas on the basis of the best guess. 

And some of the guesses were pretty\r\nwild. We knew Mars was sandy, for instance, and so we put a Bedouin\r\nin charge. That pleased the Middle East, in general, and Jordan in\r\nparticular. Jordan donated a thousand camels under Point Four point\r\nfour."\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon?" said Allister.\r\n\r\n"That\'s not double-talk. Point Four was the old terrestrial program for\r\nunderdeveloped countries. World Government adopted it and broadened it.\r\nMars is the fourth planet, so--" he traced 4.4 in the air, stabbing\r\na finger at the imaginary point "--Point Four point four. It was\r\nundoubtedly somebody\'s little whimsy in the beginning, but then it\r\nbecame accepted for the descriptive term that it was.

"\r\n\r\n"I see." 

The young man looked vague. He stubbed out his cigarette\r\ncarelessly, so that it continued to smolder in the grass.\r\n\r\n"Venus was the rainy planet," Boynton said, looking with disapproval\r\nat the smoking butt, though he did nothing about it, "so we put an\r\nEnglishman in charge. England sent a crate of Alligators."\r\n\r\nThe young man looked startled.\r\n\r\n"Alligator raincoats," Boynton said. "Things weren\'t very well\r\norganized. 

Too many things were happening too fast. There was a lot of\r\nconfusion and although the countries wanted to do what was best, no one\r\nknew exactly what that was. So they improvised as best they could on\r\nthe basis of their little knowledge."\r\n\r\n"Was it a dangerous thing?"\r\n\r\n"The little knowledge? No, not dangerous. 

Just inefficient. Then there\r\nwas Jupiter. We didn\'t bother about Mercury, although for a time there\r\nwas some uninformed talk about sending an Equatorial African to do what\r\nhe could."\r\n\r\n"Who went to Jupiter?" Allister asked.\r\n\r\n"The United States clamored for Jupiter and got it. The argument was\r\nthat the other planets would be a cinch to colonize because of their\r\nsimilarity to Earth but that Jupiter needed a real expert because it\r\nhad only its surface of liquid gas and the Red Spot."\r\n\r\n"What\'s that?

"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry. I\'d forgotten you were just a youngster when all this was\r\ngoing on. The Red Spot is the Jovians\' space platform. They built it\r\na long time ago and then they retrogressed, the way people do, and\r\nforgot how they\'d done it. Earth sent an engineer to see if it could\r\nbe done again. The Spot was pretty overpopulated and no real job of\r\ncolonization could be done until we built one more."\r\n\r\n"And did you?"\r\n\r\n"Well, we started to. Before we could really go to work anywhere,\r\nthough, we had to solve the language problem. An Australian went to\r\nwork on that. He\'d had a background of Melanesian pidgin, and if anyone\r\nwas suited to the job of cross-breeding four languages into one, he\r\nwas."\r\n\r\n"Four languages?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. English was the official language of Earth. Then there was\r\nMartian, Venusian _chat-chat_, and Spotian. It was a queer amalgam, but\r\nit could be understood by everyone, more or less."\r\n\r\n"So that\'s where it came from. _Chikker-im-up-im chat-chat too-much_,\r\neh? Interplanetary _b\xc3\xaache de mer_."\r\n\r\n"Exactly. Only of course it was called _b\xc3\xaache d\'espace_. _Me two-fellah\r\nvimb\' kitch-im pjoug by\'m by._ But even after the language difficulty\r\nwas solved, we had our troubles. They already had camels on Mars,\r\nfor instance, and the Martians were amazed when we brought in more.\r\nParticularly because theirs were wild and semi-intelligent and the\r\nfirst thing the Martian camels did was come over and liberate their\r\nbrothers from Earth. They never did come back.\r\n\r\n"Same sort of thing with the raincoats on Venus. It doesn\'t rain\r\n_down_ there, as we know now. It sort of mists _up_. From the ground.\r\nSoaks up under a raincoat in no time. These were just petty annoyances,\r\nof course, but they were symptomatic of the way our half-baked planning\r\noperated."\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t know about the people of Ganymede then?"\r\n\r\n"No. We were so busy trying to build another Red Spot that we never\r\ndid get to Jupiter\'s satellites. Oh, it was partly a matter of\r\nappropriations, too. The budget commission kept explaining to us that\r\nthere was only so much money and that we\'d better show a profit on what\r\nwe had before we put in a request to go tooling off to colonize some\r\nnew place. I guess the \'Medeans first came when you were about ten?"\r\n\r\n"Eleven," the younger man said.\r\n\r\n"They scouted our colonies and came directly to Earth. They took right\r\nover and colonized _us_."\r\n\r\nA \'Medean overseer climbed the hill effortlessly. He was tall and\r\ntentacled and the breathing apparatus over his head gave him the\r\nappearance of a mechanical man.\r\n\r\n"_Kigh-kigh pinis_," the \'Medean said. "_You two-fella all-same\r\nchat-chat too-much. B\'phava b\'long work he-stop \'long orchard pick-im\r\napple._"\r\n\r\nThe two men stood up and obediently walked down the hill toward the\r\napple orchard.\r\n\r\n"Why does he have to talk to us in that pidgin?" the young man asked.\r\n"They all speak English as well as you and me. It\'s insulting."\r\n\r\n"That\'s why they do it, I think," said Boynton, the former commissioner\r\nof colonies. "They\'re so much better at colonizing than we were that I\r\nguess they feel they have a right to rub it in."\r\n\r\nThe \'Medean had overheard them.\r\n\r\n"Damn right," he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               It was one of those days--perhaps you\'ve\r\n                 had them--when everything went right!\r\n\r\n\r\n"Let\'s go slumming," said Powers-of-pearl. "Let\'s give an earthman his\r\nwish for a day. 

We haven\'t played that game in ages."\r\n\r\n"How do we pick him?" Firepride asked indulgently. "Phone book?

"\r\n\r\n"Intensity\'s more fun. But no more nomads, I got so bored putting\r\nconnoisseur features on synthetic camels!"\r\n\r\nPeter Stone put on his hat and started for the station. 

Every third\r\nstep he inhaled and told himself: "It isn\'t that bad." Peter had a good\r\njob, a good wife, and commuting was wearing him down to a twitch. Sooty\r\nteeth-rattling train, Penn Station\'s steaming caverns, a soggy lurching\r\nbus, lunch down in sun-seared, exhaust-ventilated streets and the ride\r\nhome ... as the hated maroon dot of his train appeared, a convulsion of\r\nrevulsion shook him.\r\n\r\n"I _wish_ it weren\'t that bad!" he thought with every fiber. And\r\nPowers-of-pearl, suffused with the glow of challenge, laughed.\r\n\r\nPeter Stone, fighting at the newsstand, noted with annoyance that a\r\ncrew of maintenance men swarmed about the train. "Broke down _again_,"\r\nhe thought bitterly. Halfway down his car two men ran a vacuum cleaner\r\nover the tired plush. Keeping pace behind them, two others aimed\r\nwide-mouth silver hoses upwards, spreading thick sheets of foam on the\r\nceiling. It wasn\'t until Peter Stone unfolded his newspaper that he\r\nnoticed how quiet had spread with that foam. Next, his ears registered\r\nwith surprise the purr of freshly-oiled machinery, and his eyes the\r\nsight of a tree, for once without its double window screen of hair-oil\r\nand dried grime droplets.\r\n\r\nWhen he boarded his bus, a maintenance man was just hanging a sign over\r\nthe gagged fare box:\r\n\r\n          Due to Tax Readjustment, Urban Transportation Free.\r\n\r\nThe driver, liberated from change-making and police duties, smiled a\r\ngreeting at him. No crush in the bus, perhaps because there seemed so\r\nmany about. 

The silver one coming towards him had a big green and white\r\nsign: DOWN FIFTH TO 33rd. 

WEST ON 33rd TO SEVENTH. PENN STATION LAST\r\nSTOP. It was the first readable bus sign he remembered seeing.\r\n\r\nWhenever the light turned red, he found, squads of maintenance men\r\ndarted about the stopped cars and trucks, slapping silver cylinders\r\nover each exhaust pipe. He could hear snatches of explanations: "City\r\nordinance," "Free service." As soon as a cylinder was in place, smoke\r\nand noise stopped coming out of the exhaust.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen his hat sailed gaily towards the hook, Peter Stone realized that,\r\nincredibly, he wasn\'t tired. Work flowed through his fingers, his\r\nsecretary smiled, his boss looked in once and whistled. At noon only\r\nthe thought of paraffined carton coffee restrained him from staying in.\r\n\r\n"Coming right up, Seventeen!" said the new silver grille next to the\r\nelevator button. Cheered, he clove the mindless rush downstairs and\r\npushed inside a luncheonette where maintenance men were finishing the\r\nremoval of every second stool and the re-upholstery of the remainder\r\nwith foam cushions. A smiling waitress brought him a menu and a pencil.\r\nOpposite each item was a small circle, and a line at the top explained:\r\nTHIS IS YOUR MENUCHECK. PLEASE MARK WANTED ITEMS, DROP MENUCHECK IN\r\nSLOT.\r\n\r\nServed incredibly fast, Peter Stone ate in blissful peace. On his way\r\nout he saw that the cashier\'s cage had been replaced with three silver\r\ncabinets with hoppers for Menuchecks and money, recessed cups for\r\nchange and a turnstile each. When he walked through he found that he\r\nstill had forty minutes of his lunch hour left.\r\n\r\nForty minutes! He could walk to a bookshop, or the park ... walk,\r\nthrough exhaust fumes and the belches of airconditioner waste? But\r\nsilver mesh covered the noisome vents. A cautious sniff assured him it\r\nworked.\r\n\r\nHe decided to walk to the Library newsstands for a foreign magazine.\r\nAs he reached 42nd and Fifth an army of workmen were putting the last\r\ntouches on a structure of dull silver that spanned the four sides of\r\nthe intersection. Airy and elegant, with faint echoes of Library style,\r\nthe quadruple arch provided the perfect finishing touch for the square.\r\nEach side was composed of three escalators and moving platforms in both\r\ndirections, with a set of stairs and a promenade.\r\n\r\nTimidly, he set foot on the silver filigree. He was wafted up,\r\nacross and down. Beneath him flowed a brilliant river of quiet cars.\r\nFascinated, he took the trip back, then stood on the promenade watching\r\nthe pattern, breathing in incredulous lungfuls of clean air.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon fled on newly silent feet. Once more he put on his hat to\r\nface the ride home.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHis small, air-conditioned silver bus reached Penn Station ten minutes\r\nearlier than usual. By now Peter Stone was not overly surprised to\r\nsee silver moving ways disappearing into the Station\'s maw, nor, once\r\ninside, to feel breezes that blew silently from silver gadgets like jet\r\nengines. He also accepted the waiting passengers dancing in the great\r\nlobby--the piped music there had long been excellent.\r\n\r\nA low, pleasant voice announced his train in diamond-cut syllables\r\nthat floated from silver-dollar speakers spangling the walls. Silver\r\nescalators swept to a bright platform covered in springy non-skid\r\ngreen plastic.\r\n\r\nOne wall of his train was made up of clear plastic sliding doors.\r\nInside, there were deep pile carpets, reclining chairs, low blue\r\noverheads and movable reading lights. As the doors slid softly shut,\r\nPeter Stone remembered as usual the letter he\'d forgotten to mail for\r\nhis wife; but this time he could see a stamp machine and mail box at\r\nthe end of the car. When he got up he saw that there were also milk,\r\ncoffee, soda, fruit, cigarette, aspirin and newspaper vending machines,\r\nand three telephone booths.\r\n\r\nThe train glided to a hushed halt three minutes after a speaker at his\r\nelbow had murmured the name of his station. Before his wife\'s goggling\r\neyes, Peter Stone bounded down the steps and ran to their car. She\r\nremembered that evening the rest of her life.\r\n\r\nPowers-of-pearl let the silver evaporate, and with it the memory of it.\r\n"The best game yet," she smiled, leaning in happy exhaustion against\r\nFirepride\'s shoulder.\r\n\r\n"You were magnificent," laughed Firepride. "One step ahead of an entire\r\ncity!" 

Powers-of-pearl blushed radiantly.\r\n\r\nNo trace of their game remained. But for some obscure reason, Peter\r\nStone decided that one day he would run for Mayor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


Can\'t\r\nfigure how you do it. You\'ve got acres and acres to tend, far\'s I can\r\nsee, and I\'m having a hell of a time with one little piece of ground. I\r\nswear you must know something about this planet that I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"Just scientific farming," said Rankin carelessly. "Look, you come over\r\nhere for something, or just to gab? 

I got a lot of work to do.

"\r\n\r\nBarrows looked weary and worried. "Them brown beetles is at my crop\r\nagain," he said. "Thought you might know some way of getting rid of\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"Sure," said Rankin. "Pick them off, one by one. That\'s how I get rid of\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"Why, man," said Barrows, "you can\'t walk all over these miles and miles\r\nof farm and pick off every one of them beetles. You must know another\r\nway."\r\n\r\nRankin drew himself up and stared at Barrows. "I\'m telling you all I\r\nfeel like telling you. 

You going to stand here and jaw all day? 

Seems to\r\nme like you got work to do."\r\n\r\n"Rankin," said Barrows, "I know you were a crook back in the Terran\r\nEmpire, and that you came out beyond the border to escape the law. Seems\r\nto me, though, that even a crook, any man, would be willing to help his\r\nonly neighbor out on a lone planet like this. You might need help\r\nyourself, sometime."\r\n\r\n"You keep your thoughts about my past to yourself," said Rankin.\r\n"Remember, I keep a gun. And you\'ve got a wife and a whole bunch of kids\r\non that farm of yours. 

Be smart and let me alone."\r\n\r\n"I\'m going," said Barrows. He walked off the verandah and turned and\r\nspat carefully into the dusty path. He climbed into his ground-car and\r\ndrove off.\r\n\r\nRankin, angry, watched him go. Then he heard a humming noise from\r\nanother direction.\r\n\r\nHe turned. A huge, white globe was descending across the sky. A space\r\nship, thought Rankin, startled.\r\n\r\nPolice? This planet was outside the jurisdiction of the Terran Empire.\r\nWhen he\'d cracked that safe and made off with a hundred thousand\r\ncredits, he\'d headed here, because the planet was part of something\r\ncalled the Clearchan Confederacy. No extradition treaties or anything.\r\nPerfectly safe, if the planet was safe.\r\n\r\nAnd the planet was more than safe. There had been a hundred robots\r\nwaiting when he landed. Where they came from he didn\'t know, but Rankin\r\nprided himself on knowing how to handle robots. He\'d appropriated their\r\nservices and started his farm. At the rate he was going, he\'d be a\r\nplantation owner before long.\r\n\r\nThat must be where the ship was from. The robot said they\'d expected\r\nvisitors. Must be the Clearchan Confederacy visiting this robot outpost.\r\nWas that good or bad?\r\n\r\nFrom everything he\'d read, and from what the robots had told him, they\r\nwere probably more robots. That was good, because he knew how to handle\r\nrobots.\r\n\r\nThe white globe disappeared into the jungle of _kesh_ trees. Rankin\r\nwaited.\r\n\r\nA half hour later the column of his robot laborers marched out of the\r\nforest. There were three more robots, painted grey, at the head. The new\r\nones from the ship, thought Rankin. Well, he\'d better establish who was\r\nboss right from the start.\r\n\r\n"Stop right there!" he shouted.\r\n\r\nThe shiny robot laborers halted. But the three grey ones came on.\r\n\r\n"Stop!" shouted Rankin.\r\n\r\nThey didn\'t stop, and by the time they reached the verandah, he cursed\r\nhimself for having failed to get his gun.\r\n\r\nTwo of the huge grey robots laid gentle hands on his arms. Gentle hands,\r\nbut hands of superstrong metal.\r\n\r\nThe third said, "We have come to pass judgement on you. You have\r\nviolated our law.

"\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" said Rankin. "The only law robots have is to obey\r\norders."\r\n\r\n"It is true that the robots of your Terran Empire and these simple\r\nworkers here must obey orders. But they are subject to a higher law, and\r\nyou have forced them to break it. That is your crime.

"\r\n\r\n"What crime?" said Rankin.\r\n\r\n"We of the Clearchan Confederacy are a race of robots. Our makers\r\nimplanted one law in us, and then passed on. We have carried our law to\r\nall the planets we have colonized. In obeying your orders, these workers\r\nwere simply following that one law. You must be taken to our capital,\r\nand there be imprisoned and treated for your crime."\r\n\r\n"What law? 

What crime?"\r\n\r\n"Our law," said the giant robot, "is, _Help thy neighbor_."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ September 1957.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

]\r\n\r\n\r\nI stepped back out of the gutter and watched the tight clot of men\r\ndisappear around the corner. They hadn\'t really been menacing, just had\r\nmade it obvious they weren\'t going to break up. And that I had better\r\nget out of their way. 

I got. We were well trained.\r\n\r\nThe neon of the bar across the street flickered redly on my uniform.\r\nI watched the slush trickle off my boots for a while, then made up my\r\nmind and headed into the bar. It was a mistake.\r\n\r\nNew York had always been considered safe for us. Of course there were\r\nmany parts of the country that were absolutely forbidden "for your own\r\ngood" and others that were "highly dangerous" or at least "doubtful."\r\nBut New York had always been a haven. The stares there had even been\r\nadmiring sometimes, especially in the beginning.\r\n\r\nBut things had changed. I had realized that about half an hour after\r\ntouchdown, when we were being herded through Health Check, Baggage\r\nCheck, Security Check ... you know the lot. Before, there had been\r\nfriendly questions, genuine interest in the Mars colony, speculations\r\nabout the second expedition to Venus, even a joke or two. This time\r\nthe examiners\' only interest seemed to be in fouling us up as much as\r\npossible. And when we finally got through the rat race, New York was\r\nbleak.\r\n\r\nI should have stayed with the rest, I guess, and of course a public\r\nbar was the last place any smart spaceboy would have gone to. But I had\r\nsome nice memories of bars, memories from the early days.\r\n\r\nThe whole room went silent, as though a tube had blown, when I shoved\r\nthrough the door. I got over to an empty table as quickly as I could\r\nand inspected the list of drinks on the dispenser. This one had a lot\r\nof big nickel handles sticking up over the drink names and the whole\r\njob was shaped like one of those beer kegs you used to see pictures of.\r\nWhat I mean is, this was an _authentic_ bar.\r\n\r\nPhony as hell.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom the way this sounds, you can guess the kind of mood I\'d gotten\r\nin. The noise had picked up again right after I sat down and some\r\nof the drunker drunks were knocking the usual words around, in loud\r\nwhispers and with lots of glances at me. One of the pro-girls (her hair\r\nwas green and her blouse covered her breasts--another change while I\r\nwas out) gave me a big wink and then jabbed the man next to her and\r\nsquawked with laughter.\r\n\r\nI fed a bill into the change machine at the table and then dribbled\r\nseveral coins (prices had gone up too) into the dispenser.\r\n\r\nI guess I must have had several, because after a while I began to feel\r\ncheerful. The noise that was coming out of the box in the corner\r\nstarted to sound like music, and I got to tapping and rocking. 

And\r\nsmiling, I guess. 

And that\'s what triggered it.\r\n\r\nPeople had been coming and going, but mainly coming. And the crowd at\r\nthe bar had been getting louder, and one guy there had been getting\r\nlouder than the rest. All of a sudden, he slammed down his glass and\r\nheaded for my table. He orbited around it for a while, staring at me,\r\nand then settled jerkily down in the chair across from me.\r\n\r\n"Why all the hilarity, spaceboy? Feeling proud of yourself?"\r\n\r\nHe looked pretty wobbly and pretty soft and pretty old. And very angry.\r\nBut I was kind of wobbly myself by that time. And anyway there are\r\nstrict rules about us and violence. _Very_ strict. So I just tried to\r\nmake the smile bigger and said, "I\'m just feeling good. We had a good\r\nrun and we brought in some nice stuff.

"\r\n\r\n"Nice stuff," he said, kind of mincing. "Buddy, do you know what you\r\ncan do with your sandgems and your windstones?"\r\n\r\n"We brought back some other things too. There was a good bit of uranium\r\nand--"\r\n\r\n"We don\'t need it!" He was getting purple. "We don\'t need anything from\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"And maybe _we_ don\'t need you." I was getting sort of fired up\r\nmyself. "Carversville is self-sufficient now. You can\'t give us\r\nanything."\r\n\r\n"Well, why the hell don\'t you stay there? Why don\'t all of you stay off\r\nEarth? 

There\'s no place for you here."\r\n\r\nI could have pointed out that we brought things that Earth really\r\nneeded, that Mars and Venus had literally worlds of natural resources,\r\nwhile Earth had almost finished hers. But he began to quiet down then\r\nand I began to feel the loneliness again, the sense of loss. You can\'t\r\ngo home again ... that phrase kept poking around in my skull.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he sat up and looked straight at me, and his eyes really\r\nfocused for the first time. "What lousy luck. 

What incredibly lousy\r\nluck. And how could anyone have known?

"\r\n\r\nIt wasn\'t hard to peg what he was talking about. "It was probably\r\n_good_ luck that the first space crew was selected the way it was," I\r\nsaid. "Otherwise you\'d have had a dead ship full of dead men and no\r\nknowing why. But that one man brought the ship back."\r\n\r\n"Yeah, yeah. 

I know. And the scientists figured everything out. About\r\nradiation in space being lethal to almost all types of man. But there\r\nwas one thing that made a man immune. One thing."\r\n\r\n"The scientists tried to find a protective covering that would be\r\npracticable. They tried to synthesize slaves that would protect you.\r\nIt wasn\'t our fault that they couldn\'t."\r\n\r\n"No, not your fault." His eyes had begun to dull again. "Just a matter\r\nof enough melanin in the skin. That\'s all...." Then he straightened up\r\nand slammed his fist on the table. "Damn you, did you know I was a jet\r\npilot a long time ago? Did you know I was going to be one of the space\r\npioneers? Open up brave new worlds for Man...."\r\n\r\nHe sat there staring at me for a minute or so and the last thing he\r\nsaid was, "Don\'t you come here again--nigger."\r\n\r\nI got up and left the table and walked out of the bar. I wasn\'t\r\nprovoked. As I said before, we were well trained.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first time I realized where I was was when I bumped into the fence\r\naround the spacefield. I must have walked all the way over there from\r\nthe bar. I had a memory of crumbling buildings and littered streets.\r\nThings had changed while I had been out there. They were letting the\r\ncity run down.\r\n\r\nAs I started to walk along the fence to the gate, I saw the ship\r\ntowering against the stars. The stars and the ship. And tomorrow there\r\nwould be colonists getting aboard.\r\n\r\nI stopped and looked till I knew where home was and who the real exiles\r\nwere.\r\n\r\nI stopped feeling sorry for myself. And started feeling sorry for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Tom."\r\n\r\n"Man here to see you."\r\n\r\n"Who?"\r\n\r\n"That digger fellow.

"\r\n\r\nRuskin frowned and swore quietly. Even his holidays were shattered by\r\npeople who couldn\'t forget he was Commissioner of Internal Security.\r\nAnd these people were always little unimportant ones, like this\r\narcheologist Bigelow, whose little fears suddenly became giant threats\r\nto national security.\r\n\r\n"Send him out here, Tom."\r\n\r\nTom turned back into the house. Ruskin could hear his gruff voice\r\ninside, and a few moments later Bigelow, stooped and bespectacled,\r\nemerged from the house.\r\n\r\nRuskin smiled weakly.\r\n\r\n"Hello, Bigelow."\r\n\r\n"Good morning, Commissioner."\r\n\r\nBigelow stood, clutching his briefcase, shaking with excitement. Then\r\nsuddenly his eyes fell on Daisy and something like fear passed over his\r\nface.\r\n\r\n"Sit down, Bigelow."\r\n\r\nBigelow balanced himself delicately on the edge of a porch chair, his\r\nbriefcase resting on his long bony knees. But his eyes remained fixed\r\non the dog.\r\n\r\n"Is this social or business, Bigelow?"\r\n\r\n"Sort of both, Commissioner," he answered slowly. Then added quickly,\r\n"But I wouldn\'t disturb your holiday if it wasn\'t important."\r\n\r\nRuskin nodded dully.\r\n\r\nThen several moments of silence during which Bigelow continued to watch\r\nDaisy carefully. Finally, since his visitor did not seem inclined to\r\nspeak, Ruskin asked simply, "Well?"\r\n\r\n"First tell the dog to go away."\r\n\r\n"Daisy?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"I won\'t say a word with _IT_ here."\r\n\r\nRuskin shrugged.\r\n\r\n"As you wish," he said. 

"Daisy ... go ... go on, like a good girl."\r\n\r\nDaisy\'s big eyes seemed hurt but, reluctantly, she walked away.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBigelow watched suspiciously after her until she was well out of\r\nhearing.\r\n\r\n"Now," he began, "a week ago we started digging around the crater on\r\nthe East Coast where some great pre-Atomic cities once stood...."\r\n\r\nBigelow paused excitedly.\r\n\r\nRuskin sighed. It was much too nice a day....\r\n\r\n"... and there we came upon THREE pre-Atomic books!"\r\n\r\nBigelow paused again.\r\n\r\n"A wonderful find," Ruskin said, without enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n"More wonderful than you think, Commissioner."\r\n\r\nBigelow squared his shoulders dramatically.\r\n\r\n"Two of them were much like the other pre-Atomic books in the museums,\r\nbut the third...."\r\n\r\nBigelow was bursting with excitement.\r\n\r\n"... the third had pictures in it!"\r\n\r\nRuskin straightened up.\r\n\r\n"Amazing!"\r\n\r\nNever before had a pre-Atomic book been found with pictures. Artists\r\nhad painted their own versions drawn from the few meager written\r\ndescriptions....\r\n\r\n"How many pictures, Bigelow?"\r\n\r\n"Plenty, but just one would be enough to shake the foundations of our\r\nsocial world!"\r\n\r\nHe opened his briefcase and pulled out a small book protected by its\r\nown cloth cover. He opened to a marked page.\r\n\r\n"Just take a look at this!"\r\n\r\nRuskin took the book and stared curiously at a picture showing a\r\ndressed up dog sitting in a chair patting a human on the head. The\r\ncaption read: MAN\'S BEST FRIEND GETS REWARD.\r\n\r\nRuskin glanced back at Bigelow.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t understand," he said slowly. "Is it some kind of joke-book?"\r\n\r\nBigelow grinned narrowly.\r\n\r\n"A very bitter joke, Commissioner. A joke of Mother Nature\'s."\r\n\r\n"I\'m still not sure I understand...."\r\n\r\n"I think you do, Commissioner," Bigelow countered quickly. "Now so many\r\nof the things we couldn\'t understand become clear to us. The naked\r\nanimal on the floor in the picture is our ancestor, and the hairless\r\nthing in the chair is our dog!"\r\n\r\nRuskin shook his head.\r\n\r\n"Impossible!

"\r\n\r\n"Not at all! In the lower animal and plant orders more amazing\r\nmutations occurred during the Atomic Wars--we just never noticed\r\nbecause they didn\'t touch us closely."\r\n\r\nRuskin\'s mind rushed over the implications, all the frightful and\r\ncarefully ignored aberrations of the Atomic blasts.\r\n\r\nIf it was true, and he still wouldn\'t let himself be convinced, it\r\nwould be a tremendous blow to the morale of Society. And it was his\r\nduty to protect the well-being of Society. He must decide ... now ...\r\nfor Society....\r\n\r\n"This is a very delicate problem, Bigelow," he said finally.\r\n\r\n"I know, Commissioner."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve come upon something ... 

fantastic."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Commissioner."\r\n\r\n"We must handle this very carefully.

"\r\n\r\n"I understand."\r\n\r\n"Good. Leave the book with me ... for security reasons ... and I\'ll\r\nfigure how to handle it."\r\n\r\n"Well...."\r\n\r\n"Of course, I\'ll see that you get all the credit you deserve."\r\n\r\nBigelow rose.\r\n\r\n"Very well, Commissioner. I\'ll leave it in your hands."\r\n\r\nHe left with the air of a man just conquering the world.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRuskin sat, the closed book in both hands, for a long long while. It\r\nwas very late when he called the Psycho Section.\r\n\r\n"Yes," Psycho answered. "We have a file on Bigelow."\r\n\r\n"Have you ever interned him?"\r\n\r\n"No. But he\'s catalogued as extremely unstable."\r\n\r\n"Fine. 

Thank you.

"\r\n\r\nRuskin placed the receiver carefully back on the cradle. Nothing to\r\nfear from Bigelow. He rose and walked slowly toward the fire.\r\n\r\nHe looked down at the book.\r\n\r\nWar! War! War! From the beginning of man almost to his own destruction.\r\n\r\nSince the Atomic Wars Earth had been comparatively peaceful--because,\r\npeople thought, Man had become surfeited of war.\r\n\r\nRuskin frowned.\r\n\r\nAttitudes, someone had once said, are more important than facts.\r\n\r\nHe dropped the book into the flames.\r\n\r\nVery well, then.\r\n\r\nLet Earth be happy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDaisy walked slowly over to him and barked quietly. The pretty golden\r\nhair hung gently over her shoulders, and her blue eyes were very soft.\r\n\r\nRuskin patted her gently.\r\n\r\n"Nice doggie," he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


We did a double take. 

"Hey! That\'s not the\r\n    hero." She looked us straight in the eye. "Can you prove it?" She\r\n    had us. We couldn\'t, and she left hurriedly to go home and cook\r\n    dinner for her family. And what were they having? Frog legs--what\r\n    else?_\r\n\r\n\r\nThey were in the garden. "Now, Zoe," said Zenia Hawkins to her\r\nnine-year-old daughter, "quit fluttering around, and papa will tell you\r\na story."\r\n\r\nZoe settled down in the hammock. "A true story, papa?

"\r\n\r\n"It all happened exactly like I\'m going to tell you," said Drake\r\nHawkins, pinching Zoe\'s rosy cheek. "Now: two thousand and eleven years\r\nago in 1985, figuring by the earthly calendar of that time, a tribe of\r\nbeings from the Dog-star Sirius invaded the earth."\r\n\r\n"And what did these beings look like, father?

"\r\n\r\n"Like humans in many, many respects. They each had two arms, two legs\r\nand all the other organs that humans are endowed with."\r\n\r\n"Wasn\'t there any difference at all between the Star-beings and the\r\nhumans, papa?"\r\n\r\n"There was. The newcomers, each and all, had a pair of wings covered\r\nwith green feathers growing from their shoulders, and long, purple\r\ntails."\r\n\r\n"How many of these beings were there, father?"\r\n\r\n"Exactly three million and forty-one male adults and three female\r\nadults. These creatures first appeared on Earth on the island of\r\nSardinia. In five weeks\' time they were the masters of the entire\r\nglobe."\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t the Earth-lings fight back, papa?"\r\n\r\n"The humans warred against the invaders, using bullets, ordinary\r\nbombs, super-atom bombs and gases."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Illustrator: A. Lake]\r\n\r\n"What were those things like, father?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, they\'ve passed out of existence long ago. \'Ammunition\' they were\r\ncalled. The humans fought each other with such things."\r\n\r\n"And not with ideas, like we do now, father?"\r\n\r\n"No, with guns, just like I told you. But the invaders were immune to\r\nthe ammunition."\r\n\r\n"What does \'immune\' mean?"\r\n\r\n"Proof against harm. Then the humans tried germs and bacteria against\r\nthe star-beings."\r\n\r\n"What were those things?"\r\n\r\n"Tiny, tiny bugs that the humans tried to inject into the bodies of the\r\ninvaders to make them sicken and die. But the bugs had no effect at all\r\non the star-beings."\r\n\r\n"Go on, papa. 

These beings over-ran all Earth. 

Go on from there."\r\n\r\n"You must know, these newcomers were vastly more intelligent than the\r\nEarth-lings. In fact, the invaders were the greatest mathematicians in\r\nthe System."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the System? And what does mathematician mean?"\r\n\r\n"The Milky Way. A mathematician is one who is good at figuring,\r\nweighing, measuring, clever with numbers."\r\n\r\n"Then, father, the invaders killed off all the Earth-lings?

"\r\n\r\n"Not all. They killed many, but many others were enslaved. Just as the\r\nhumans had used horses and cattle, the newcomers so used the humans.\r\nThey made workers out of some, others they slaughtered for food."\r\n\r\n"Papa, what sort of language did these Star-beings talk?"\r\n\r\n"A very simple language, but the humans were never able to master it.\r\nSo, the invaders, being so much smarter, mastered all the languages of\r\nthe globe."\r\n\r\n"What did the Earth-lings call the invaders, father?"\r\n\r\n"\'An-vils\'. Half angels, half devils."\r\n\r\n"Then, papa, everything was peaceful on Earth after the An-vils enslaved\r\nthe humans?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"For a little while. Then, some of the most daring of the humans, led by\r\na man named Knowall, escaped into the interior of Greenland. This\r\nKnowall was a psychiatrist, the foremost on Earth."\r\n\r\n"What\'s a psychiatrist?"\r\n\r\n"A dealer in ideas."\r\n\r\n"Then, he was very rich?"\r\n\r\n"He\'d been the richest human on Earth. After some profound thought,\r\nKnowall figured a way to rid the earth of the An-vils."\r\n\r\n"How, papa?

"\r\n\r\n"He perfected a method, called the Knowall-Hughes, Ilinski technique, of\r\nimbuing these An-vils with human emotions."\r\n\r\n"What does \'imbuing\' mean?"\r\n\r\n"He filled them full of and made them aware of."\r\n\r\nZenia interrupted, "Aren\'t you talking a bit above the child\'s\r\nunderstanding, Drake?"\r\n\r\n"No, mama," said Zoe. "I understand what papa explained. 

Now, don\'t\r\ninterrupt."\r\n\r\n"So, Knowall," continued Drake, "filled the An-vils with human feelings\r\nsuch as Love, Hate, Ambition, Jealousy, Malice, Envy, Despair, Hope,\r\nFear, Shame and so on. Very soon the An-vils were acting like humans,\r\nand in ten days, terrible civil wars wiped out the An-vils\' population\r\nby two-thirds."\r\n\r\n"Then, papa, the An-vils finally killed off each other?"\r\n\r\n"Almost, until among them a being named Zalibar, full of saintliness and\r\npersuasion, preached the brotherhood of all An-vils. The invaders,\r\nquickly converted, quit their quarrels, and the Earth-lings were even\r\nmore enslaved."\r\n\r\n"Oh, papa, weren\'t Knowall and his followers in Greenland awfully sad\r\nthe way things had turned out?"\r\n\r\n"For a while. Then Knowall came up with the final pay-off."\r\n\r\n"Is that slang, papa? Pay-off?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. The coup-de-grace. The ace in the hole that he\'d saved, if all\r\nelse failed."\r\n\r\n"I understand, papa. The idea that would out-trump anything the other\r\nside had to offer. What was it, father? 

What did they have?"\r\n\r\n"Knowall imbued the An-vils with nostalgia."\r\n\r\n"What is nostalgia?"\r\n\r\n"Home sickness."\r\n\r\n"Oh, papa, wasn\'t Knowall smart? That meant, the An-vils were all filled\r\nwith the desire to fly back to the star from where they had started."\r\n\r\n"Exactly. So, one day, all the An-vils, an immense army, flapping their\r\ngreat green wings, assembled in the Black Hills of North America, and,\r\nat a given signal, they all rose up from Earth and all the humans\r\nchanted, \'Glory, glory, the day of our deliverance!\'"\r\n\r\n"So then, father, all the An-vils flew away from Earth?"\r\n\r\n"Not all. There were two child An-vils, one male and one female, aged\r\ntwo years, who had been born on Earth, and they started off with all the\r\nother An-vils and flew up into the sky. But when they reached the upper\r\nlimits of the strato-sphere, they hesitated, turned tail and fluttered\r\nback to Earth where they had been born. Their names were Zizzo and\r\nZizza."\r\n\r\n"And what happened to Zizzo and Zizza, papa?"\r\n\r\n"Well, like all the An-vils, they were great mathematicians. So, they\r\nmultiplied."\r\n\r\n"Oh, papa," laughed Zoe, flapping her wings excitedly, "that was a very\r\nnice story!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ Oct.-Nov. 1953.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

]\r\n\r\n\r\n"In the middle of the night," the man said to the landlady over a\r\nsoft-boiled egg and a slice of toast. "Right under my window." 

He\r\nleaned forward. "You know how children talk to themselves?"\r\n\r\n"Was it the same voice you heard the first two nights?" Mrs. Tilton\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not sure now about the first night. Might have been another voice\r\nthat first night."\r\n\r\n"And now it was a child?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nMrs. Tilton rose to get the coffee. "Are you quite sure?

"\r\n\r\n"You don\'t think I\'m imagining?"\r\n\r\n"We have no children," she said.\r\n\r\n"A neighbor\'s, no doubt."\r\n\r\n"There isn\'t a child in the whole village, Mr. Coat.

"\r\n\r\n"That\'s what puzzles me. 

Don\'t you think we ought to report it?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll get your coffee," she said, and went into the kitchen.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t actually _see_ the child," he called to her. "But I\'m sure I\r\nheard the voice."\r\n\r\nThe woman brought the cup of coffee; she had poured it in the kitchen.\r\nThe first two mornings, he remembered, she had set the coffee pot on\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t you having any?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I had mine, thank you. Will you want anything else?"\r\n\r\nHe could see past her into the kitchen--the corner of a large\r\nwood-burning stove and a row of brass pots. The floor was flagstoned\r\nand a hand pump stood over a sink.\r\n\r\n"Do you really grow your own strawberries?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes. 

Would you like some?"\r\n\r\n"Very much."\r\n\r\nMrs. Tilton went to get the berries. She had forgotten to serve cream\r\nwith the coffee. The coffee had a bitter taste and a faint smell of\r\niodine. But he was not used to natural coffee. And without cream. He\r\ntook another sip and slowly stretched his stiff legs. In the window he\r\nsaw lilac bushes in bloom.\r\n\r\n"Picked this morning," Mrs. Tilton said, setting a bowl of strawberries\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\n"Oh, thank you." He sniffed at the berries. "They smell of earth," he\r\nsaid, smiling at her.\r\n\r\n"You might like a walk after breakfast," Mrs. Tilton suggested. "Then\r\nyou can have a restful nap at noon."\r\n\r\n"Good idea," he said. "Excuse me, but the coffee seems bitter."\r\n\r\nMrs. Tilton looked at the old man as if she did not understand.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid I\'m a nuisance," he apologized, "but I take cream with my\r\ncoffee."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry, I forgot."\r\n\r\nShe brought a small cream pitcher.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe old man turned the pitcher in his hand. It was lopsided and made of\r\ninferior clay "Do you make your own pottery, too?"\r\n\r\n"Such as it is."\r\n\r\n"Charming." He set down the pitcher and leaned back with a sigh. "You\r\nknow, I pretended I did not want a rest, but I could hardly wait to see\r\nthe country again."\r\n\r\n"You weren\'t born in the city?"\r\n\r\n"I was born in a village no larger than this. Of course it\'s all gone\r\nnow, swallowed up by the city. But in those days it was an hour\'s\r\nheliride from the city. I remember a thing or two."\r\n\r\nMrs. Tilton watched him drink the coffee.\r\n\r\n"Not many people left who remember those days," he said. "For\r\ninstance, did you know that unadjustables--they called them criminals\r\nthen--were actually electrocuted? Strapped down to a horrible chair--"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you want the strawberries, Mr. Coat?"\r\n\r\nHe looked down at the strawberries in the bowl. "Just imagine--" but he\r\nforgot what he had wanted to say.\r\n\r\nThe woman went into the kitchen.\r\n\r\nHe had just finished drinking the coffee when he heard the child\'s\r\nvoice in the lane outside the window. The same voice. 

He crossed to the\r\nwindow and looked out. The lane was empty.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Tilton!"\r\n\r\nHe heard no answer.\r\n\r\nHe went into the kitchen. The door to the garden stood open. He saw her\r\nworking in a vegetable patch.\r\n\r\n"Pst ... pst!"\r\n\r\nShe looked up.\r\n\r\n"Did you see the child?" he called. "It must have turned into the\r\ngarden."\r\n\r\nMrs. Tilton straightened herself, holding her back with both hands.\r\n"The child?"\r\n\r\n"The voice, I just heard it again."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be with you in a moment, Mr. Coat."\r\n\r\nHe looked round the kitchen--the antique flagstones, the brass pots,\r\nthe stove, the hand pump. There was only one anachronism: on the wall\r\nby the door, stuck behind a cluster of radishes, was a World Union\r\nTelegram.\r\n\r\nOut in the vegetable patch, he saw Mrs. Tilton was looking about for\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\nOn an impulse he took down the telegram, and read:\r\n\r\n    RECOAT IF VOICES PERSIST TO THIRD MORNING PROCEED EUTHANASIA\r\n    SUGGEST USING COFFEE FORMULA TWO ADVISE OFFICE OF CHIEF PSYCH WMA\r\n\r\nHe stuck the telegram behind the radishes and looked out the door. Mrs.\r\nTilton was coming with a basket on her arm.\r\n\r\n"You heard the child again, Mr. Coat?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps ... I was mistaken."\r\n\r\n"Strange, I saw nobody." She put the basket on the kitchen table; it\r\nwas filled with peas. "Did you have enough coffee?"\r\n\r\nHe nodded.\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t you feeling well?"\r\n\r\n"I ... am fine. Yes."\r\n\r\nThe executioner looked as if she could not make up her mind about him.\r\nThen she smiled. She brought out a wooden bowl, and sat down at the\r\ntable to shell the peas.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you take your walk now? You\'ll enjoy our little market\r\nplace."\r\n\r\n"Yes." Such a nice day, he thought, shuffling to the window. Spring.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe had enjoyed the market yesterday until he had noticed that there\r\nwere no children about. No children at all. 

Only adult primitives and a\r\nfew well-trained functionaries like Mrs. Tilton.\r\n\r\nIn the sky in the window he saw a rocket cutting a thin line as it left\r\nthe atmosphere.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll have your bed ready for your noon nap," she said.\r\n\r\nHe turned from the window. "Noon?"\r\n\r\n"You\'ll want a nice restful nap then."\r\n\r\nHe had imagined the poisoned coffee would work faster. His heart\r\nbeating, he said, "Those are peas, aren\'t they?"\r\n\r\nShe nodded. 

Her hands were busy shelling. "I hung your cane on the coat\r\nrack," she said.\r\n\r\n"If you don\'t mind, Mrs. Tilton, I\'d rather not go out today. I\'d very\r\nmuch like to try shelling peas for you."\r\n\r\n"Why, of course. 

Pull up that chair, why don\'t you?"\r\n\r\nSitting down, he reached his trembling hands into the basket and came\r\nup with a handful of the green wonders. Mrs. Tilton moved the basket\r\nnearer him.\r\n\r\n"After a while I\'ll go up to my room," he promised. "I feel a little\r\ntired already."\r\n\r\n"Certainly."\r\n\r\nHe split a shell and slid his thumb under the peas. They rolled into\r\nhis hand. He counted nine. He dropped them in the bowl, then put one in\r\nhis mouth and chewed. It had a sweet taste.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Mrs. Tilton."\r\n\r\n"Not at all, Mr. 

Coat."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


"\r\n\r\n"Hell, wait\'ll we hit air!"\r\n\r\n"We all awake? Anyone asleep say \'aye.\'"\r\n\r\n"Aye."\r\n\r\n"No one\'s asleep. I heard four voices."\r\n\r\n"If anyone can sleep through this they\'ve got my blessings. Woof! 

My\r\nneck."\r\n\r\n"You think you\'ve got it bad; they\'ve got me squeezed in with the camera\r\nequipment; I\'m bent at the knees and again at the waist."\r\n\r\n"Ah, but after we land."\r\n\r\n"Ah, after we land."\r\n\r\n"And _if_ we land, of course."\r\n\r\n"_If_ we land?

"\r\n\r\n"Wish I could see out! What\'s it like?"\r\n\r\n"Same as before."\r\n\r\n"I can see someone\'s leg and the back of someone\'s head. Damn this lousy\r\nintercom. I can\'t even recognize voices."\r\n\r\n"What\'s it matter who we are? We\'re just a lousy pack of sardines \'til\r\nwe hit Earth."\r\n\r\n"Good old Earth--hell with it."\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen--I would make a speech!"\r\n\r\n"Also the hell with you!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m gonna drown if I keep sweating like this."\r\n\r\n"Shut up! I\'ve got something more important to say than your groaning."\r\n\r\n"If we must."\r\n\r\n"The next speaker will be the honorable--who the hell are you anyway,\r\nbub?"\r\n\r\n"We ... have just ... visited ... the moon!"\r\n\r\n"Hear!"\r\n\r\n"There\'s one more important thing we have to do before we land."\r\n\r\n"You mean slow down?"\r\n\r\n"One thing to talk over. 

Look ... Williams! I have a strong suspicion\r\nyou signed on this trip for some reason beside glory. Right?

"\r\n\r\n"\'Cause Earth was getting too crowded for me."\r\n\r\n"How about you, Wong?"\r\n\r\n"Needed a change, too, I guess. Been breathing fresh air and seeing\r\npeople too long. Got sick of it."\r\n\r\n"And John?"\r\n\r\n"Well ... I suppose I know what you\'re heading at. This isn\'t exactly a\r\nJules Verne type trip to the moon, \'for the glory and advancement of\r\nscience.\' \'Least it isn\'t to me. I got sick of science when I was\r\nstudying for my _master\'s_. 

Sick of seeing what people were doing with\r\nit. I thought a few new worlds might ease the tension back on Earth ...\r\nbefore everything gets blown to pieces."\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I mean; a few new worlds to explore might slow lousy man in\r\nhis wild race to the backside of heaven. New frontiers. New excitements.\r\nIt\'s bound to tie people closer together in spite of their prejudices."\r\n\r\n"But the glory! Don\'t forget the glory!"\r\n\r\n"The patriotic zeal!"\r\n\r\n"Yeah, the patriotic zeal! I feel the same way you do.

"I mean, with\r\nall due respect, of course."\r\n\r\nNo man enjoys coming into his dining room and having to sit at meals and\r\nlook at a full-sized picture of his wife\'s first husband arriving on\r\nVenus. Fair\'s fair, but such a set-up is ridiculous.\r\n\r\n"No," Phoebe shook her blonde head. "Don Manton loved me and he was\r\nfamous. I like to be reminded of the days when my picture was in all the\r\ntelepapers and my face on so many telescreens."\r\n\r\nShe might just as well have called him a tattered nonentity, though\r\nHenry was doing pretty well as a foreman in the local humandroid\r\nfactory. He was stopped from reminding her by Phoebe\'s saying that she\'d\r\nleave for a bit of shopping. She left abruptly.\r\n\r\nHenry watched her takeoff from the roof of their two-story fibroid house\r\nand went back to the dining room. Now, even his warmest admirers would\r\ngive in that he had a streak of stubbornness in him a mile wide and six\r\nmiles deep. Henry took the three-dimensional monstrosity off the wall,\r\nholding it hard by thumb and forefinger on its luminex frame, and\r\nprepared to say good-by to the picture of Don Manton.\r\n\r\nA foreman at one of the humandroid shops has to be able to consider\r\nalternatives and Henry had done this. If he only hid the picture there\'d\r\nbe a domestic crisis and the picture would sooner or later be back on\r\nthe wall; if he destroyed it there\'d also be a crisis, but one that\r\nwould eventually blow over.\r\n\r\nUnluckily for him, these three-dimensional wall pictures were made out\r\nof glaseine, and when he tried setting fire to it he nearly burned down\r\nthe house. Upon feeding it to the old-fashioned fireplace nothing grew\r\nhot except his temper. Ripping the picture to shreds would have been the\r\nnext step, but you can\'t rip glaseine.\r\n\r\nFor maybe the six millionth time he cursed out Don Manton, the\r\nwell-known explorer in the realm of outer space. Henry understood in a\r\ngeneral way that Don Manton had been among the first to chart the cities\r\nof Mars and Venus, and had accidentally died on a planet named Immel;\r\nbut Henry had no intention of living in Don Manton\'s shadow.\r\n\r\nThe picture, which showed the late explorer talking with three\r\nVenusians, had been hung up again when Phoebe came through the ceiling\r\ndoor along the extension stairway which flicked up to meet her.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve been trying to get rid of Don\'s picture!"\r\n\r\nHe\'d hung it crookedly, and a diagonal slash of white wallpaper had\r\ngiven him away.\r\n\r\n"Just this one. 

You\'ve got cans of telefilm in the cellar, but them I\r\ndon\'t mind. This," he flicked it with a thumbnail, "I do mind."\r\n\r\n"As long as I stay," Phoebe said quietly, "my darling Don\'s picture\r\nstays."\r\n\r\n"But what about your darling Henry? Am I just a humandroid who looks and\r\nbehaves and talks like a human being? Haven\'t I got feelings?" Henry\r\nstrode around the room, hitting the fibroid floor like a prehistoric\r\nmonster on a sandpaper bridge. "Either that picture goes," he said\r\nfinally, definitely, "or I go!"\r\n\r\nPhoebe shook out her blonde hair, letting it fall about her shoulders.\r\n"Too bad."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nInside of an hour he had packed his suitcases. Phoebe cried bitterly,\r\nbut wouldn\'t budge about the picture. Henry took the plane. He put up at\r\nhis club, went to the bar, and was gobbling down something called\r\npressurized scotch, when he heard a noise back of him.\r\n\r\n"Get away from me!" said Henry, who was quite a few over the traditional\r\neight by this time. "I\'ve had enough of Don Manton, let alone his\r\nhelpers."\r\n\r\nSpeed Roggs, who had taken a couple of trips with Manton, was tall and\r\nthin as the barstool, and with a spaceman\'s ability to think fast when\r\nhe had to. Loudly he ordered a Venuswiz, explaining to a disgusted\r\nHenry, "After the barkeep mixes the drink he melts the swizzle stick and\r\npours that in, too." He gulped the stuff down gratefully, then said,\r\n"Tell me your troubles, Hank."\r\n\r\nHenry did. 

Speed Roggs looked disgusted. "Are you serious?" he asked,\r\nand when Henry swore to cut Speed\'s throat on asking that again, went\r\non, "Women are space-mad!"\r\n\r\nAs Henry agreed, Roggs said, "The one thing you don\'t understand about\r\nDon Manton is that he was maladjusted. He couldn\'t stay still, he always\r\nwanted what he couldn\'t have. 

That goes for his feelings for women,\r\ntoo.

"\r\n\r\nHenry looked up with bloodshot eyes nearly popping out of his head.\r\n\r\nRoggs kept going. "Don and Phoebe never got along once they were\r\nmarried. It was Manton\'s fault. Like all explorers he was unhappy over\r\nhis lot and looked beyond the rainbow. 

In fact, he told me once that the\r\nonly reason he went in for exploring space was to get away from his\r\nwife."\r\n\r\nHenry Weller suddenly rocked with laughter. He got to his feet, took\r\nRoggs, and went to his room, still laughing. He lay on the bed for half\r\nan hour. At the end of that time he sat up.\r\n\r\n"Tell the manager I won\'t be here for supper," he said to Speed. "I\'ve\r\ngot a little trip to make.

"\r\n\r\n"Where are you going?"\r\n\r\n"Home, to give the good tidings to my wife."\r\n\r\nHenry\'s fibroid house looked about the same. He parked the plane and let\r\nhimself in by the roof door and down the extension staircase. He found\r\nPhoebe in the kitchen bent over a pot, and at sound of him she turned. A\r\nnear-smile flickered in her blue eyes.\r\n\r\n"Phoebe ..."\r\n\r\n"Henry ..."\r\n\r\nThey laughed together. Henry wanted to tell her what he knew as bitterly\r\nand maliciously as possible, but he simply opened his mouth a few times.\r\nHe couldn\'t say it. Everyone is entitled to an illusion and this was\r\nPhoebe, his blonde wench, his wife, his woman. He looked a bit sick.\r\n\r\nShe smiled. "Come into the dining room."\r\n\r\nThe three-dimensional picture had been rolled up into the corner. Henry\r\npromised to put it away in the cellar and clean up the cellar as soon as\r\nhe could. Phoebe said that her first husband had never liked to stay\r\nhome, he\'d always been afraid to live normally.\r\n\r\n"I was wrong about the picture," she told him, "and I didn\'t know till I\r\nsaw you leave the house."\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that Henry and his Phoebe lived happily ever\r\nafter, but it is perhaps not so well known that Phoebe was left with a\r\nlittle disposal problem, too. She had a rough time finding a buyer (in\r\nsecret, of course) for her brand-new humandroid, who looked and behaved\r\nand talked so exactly like that well-known flyer, Speed Roggs....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Imagination Stories of Science and\r\n    Fantasy_ August 1953.

"\r\n\r\nI sipped my drink and tried to think of a subtle way to change the\r\nsubject. I didn\'t like to hear a person\'s personal problems and every\r\ntime I visited George, he invariably complained about Helen. If it had\r\nbeen anyone else, I might have thought it wasn\'t entirely Helen\'s fault,\r\nbut George and I had been roommates in college and I knew him like a\r\nbrother. He was a person who got along with almost everyone.\r\nIntelligent, easy-going and likeable.\r\n\r\nHe lifted his glass and glared at me as if I were the guilty party.\r\n"She\'s a worry-wart," he continued. "A hypochondriac, a neurotic, an\r\nescapist, and a communist." He studied the ceiling thoughtfully. "And\r\nsometimes I think she\'s a little crazy."\r\n\r\nI tried to calm him, "Don\'t worry about it. If things get worse, get a\r\ndivorce."\r\n\r\n"Divorce, ha! She wouldn\'t give me a divorce if--"\r\n\r\nThe door opened.\r\n\r\nHelen smiled half-heartedly, her pale face quickly resuming its unhappy\r\nexpression as if it tired her facial muscles when she smiled. "Hello,\r\nEd. 

Nice to see you again."\r\n\r\n"Hello, Helen." I glanced at George and noticed he had closed his eyes\r\nas if the sight of his wife was unbearable. His lower lip was white\r\nwhere he gripped it with his teeth and I silently hoped he wouldn\'t draw\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nHelen sank into a chair and raised her skirt to reveal her right leg.\r\n"Did George tell you about my legs?" she inquired. 

She stroked the leg\r\naffectionately. "Arthritis. George grafted a new one on for me. Feels\r\nten times better."\r\n\r\nMy face blanched. The idea of replacing body parts from Banks didn\'t\r\nnauseate me. If a man is in an automobile accident and loses an arm, and\r\nthat arm can be replaced, I think that\'s marvelous. What sickened me\r\nwere the people who actually _enjoyed_ having a part of their body\r\nreplaced with a part from a criminal or corpse.\r\n\r\n"No." I sat down. 

My knees were weak. I felt short of breath. "George\r\ndidn\'t tell me. I--"\r\n\r\nShe interrupted with details of the operation. The details and list of\r\nher other ailments lasted half an hour, during which George drank\r\nsteadily and I waited for a lull so I could glance at my watch and say\r\nsomething about being late for an appointment.\r\n\r\nI saw George several times during the next few weeks. Never at his\r\nhouse. I didn\'t visit him on my own initiative because Helen, as I had\r\nseen during my last visit, had passed from the stage of being unpleasant\r\nand reached the stage of being unbearable. I didn\'t want to be around\r\nher or listen to her, and George must have realized my feelings because\r\nhe didn\'t invite me to his house for some time.\r\n\r\nBut both of us had a habit of stopping at a club on the outskirts of\r\ntown and we met there often. Each time we met, George complained. Each\r\ntime, he seemed to drink more and complain more.\r\n\r\nI worried about his job. He was a surgeon--one of the best--and a\r\nsurgeon needs good nerves and steady hands when he performs delicate\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nI urged him to get a divorce, but he said he didn\'t want one. "I love\r\nHelen," he said one time. "Well, I don\'t exactly love _Helen_, but I\r\nlove her body. It\'s like the old saying about marrying a girl because\r\nshe\'s pretty is like picking a rose by looking at the stem. We\'re all\r\ndifferent, you know, and we all have different tastes. When I first saw\r\nHelen-- Well, she\'s just right for me. To me, she looks as good as\r\nMarilyn Monroe looks to the average man. I like having her around. I\'d\r\nbe lost without her, but at the same time, she\'s changed so damned much,\r\nshe makes me sick.

"\r\n\r\nAnd there it was. He still wanted Helen but she had changed into a\r\npersonality that he hated. Over a period of years, she had changed into\r\na morbid hypochondriac, an unpleasant woman who enjoyed--more than\r\nanything else--such things as having one of her legs replaced and\r\nsampling the latest pills and drugs. George said he had tried to get her\r\nto see a psychiatrist but she refused. And you can\'t have a person\r\ncommitted to a mental institution because they have an unpleasant\r\npersonality!\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if there was no solution to his problem.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen, late one evening, I received a phone call from George. "Come over\r\nand have a few drinks," he said. 

"We\'ll have a party! Helen\'s changed.\r\nYou should see her!"\r\n\r\nI was interested in his problem, so I went.\r\n\r\nHelen greeted me at the door and I had the surprise of my life. At one\r\ntime, she had been beautiful, but she had faded during the past few\r\nyears. By staying indoors, she had grown pale, listless. As her\r\npersonality changed, it had also changed her features, and her eyes had\r\ndeveloped a sleepy, lifeless look, and deep lines had formed on her\r\nface.\r\n\r\nBut the Helen who greeted me that night was not like that. Her face had\r\na healthy flush, her eyes sparkled and she seemed vibrant, bubbling ...\r\njust like the Helen I had known so long ago.\r\n\r\nGeorge and I had a good time that night. He laughed and joked for the\r\nfirst time in months. We drank, talked, played chess, and then drank and\r\ntalked some more.\r\n\r\nEvery now and then, Helen would float by, a gorgeous creature, laughing\r\nat George\'s jokes, mixing our drinks, and smiling at George as if he\r\nwere the most wonderful man in the world.\r\n\r\nWhen I couldn\'t bear it any longer, I whispered, "What happened?"\r\n\r\nGeorge drained his glass and shouted across the room, "Come here,\r\nHelen!"\r\n\r\nShe came.\r\n\r\nGeorge said, "Promise not to tell anyone? It\'s very important.

"\r\n\r\nI couldn\'t imagine his reason for asking me that, but I said, "I\r\npromise."\r\n\r\n"Well," George explained, "I can\'t take all the credit. I\'m a fairly\r\ngood surgeon, but Lucas had the hardest job. We did it together. 

Do you\r\nknow Lucas? He\'s an electrical engineer ... _a genius_. He designed that\r\nelectronic calculator at--"\r\n\r\n"Show him," Helen interrupted. "_Show him!_" She was giggling, laughing,\r\nalmost jumping up and down with joy. I thought: _She\'s her old self\r\nagain, cheerful, bubbling over ..._\r\n\r\nGeorge said, "I finally realized what she needed more than anything\r\nelse ..."\r\n\r\nHe raised Helen\'s soft brown hair and opened a small panel in the back\r\nof her head. In the recess was a maze of tubes and electrical wiring.\r\n\r\n"She needed a new head," George said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ August 1958.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

observed one of the council members. "You do have a\r\nproblem."\r\n\r\n"But we must find something for him to do," said another. "We can\'t have\r\nan idle person in the State. It\'s unthinkable.

"\r\n\r\n"But what?" asked the Chief. "He\'s utterly incapable of running any of\r\nthe machines. I\'ve tried to teach him. The only things he can do, are\r\nalready being done much better by robots."\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence, broken at last by one little, old council\r\nmember.\r\n\r\n"I have it," he cried. "The very thing. We\'ll make him guard of the\r\nTreasure."\r\n\r\n"But there\'s no need of a guard. No one will touch the Treasure without\r\npermission. We haven\'t had a dishonest person in the State for more than\r\nthree thousand years."\r\n\r\n"That\'s it, exactly. There aren\'t any dishonest people, so there won\'t\r\nbe anything for him to do. But we will have solved the problem of his\r\nidleness."\r\n\r\n"It might be a solution," said the Chief. "At least, a temporary one. I\r\nsuppose we will have to find something else later on. 

But this will give\r\nus time to look for something."\r\n\r\nSo I became guard of the Treasure. With a badge. And nothing to\r\ndo--unless you count watching the Key. The gates were kept locked, just\r\nas they were in the old days, but the large Key hung beside them. Of\r\ncourse, no one wanted to bother carrying it around. It was too heavy.\r\nThe only ones who ever used it, anyway, were members of the council. As\r\nthe man said, we haven\'t had a dishonest person in the State for\r\nthousands of years. Even I know that much.\r\n\r\nOf course, this left me with lots of time on my hands. 

That\'s how I\r\nhappened to get her in the first place. I\'d always wanted one, but pets\r\nwere forbidden. Busy people didn\'t have time for them. 

So I knew I was\r\nbreaking the Law. But I figured that no one would ever find out.\r\n\r\nFirst I fixed a place for her, and made a brush screen, so that she\r\ncouldn\'t be seen by anyone coming to the gates. Then, one night, I\r\nsneaked into the forest and got her.\r\n\r\nIt wasn\'t so lonely after that. Now I had something to talk to. She was\r\nsmall when I got her--it would be too dangerous to go near a full grown\r\none--but she grew rapidly. That was because I caught small animals and\r\nbrought them to her. Not having to depend on what she could catch, she\r\ngrew almost twice as fast as usual, and was so sleek and pretty. Really,\r\nshe was a pet to be proud of.\r\n\r\nI don\'t know how I could have stood the four months there alone, if I\r\nhadn\'t her to talk to. I don\'t think she really understood me, but I\r\npretended she did, and that helped.\r\n\r\nEvery three or four weeks, three of the council members came to take a\r\npart of the Treasure, or to add to it. Always three of them.\r\n\r\nThat\'s why I was so surprised one day, to see one man coming by\r\nhimself. It was Gremm, the little old member, who had recommended that I\r\nbe given this job. I was happy to see him, and we talked for a while,\r\nmostly about my work, and how I liked it. I almost told him about my\r\npet, but I didn\'t, because he might be angry at me for breaking the Law.\r\n\r\nFinally, he asked me to give him the Key.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been sent to get something from the Treasure," he explained.\r\n\r\nI was unhappy to displease him, but I said, "I can\'t let you have it.\r\nThere must be three members. You know that.

"\r\n\r\n"Of course, I know it. But something came up suddenly, so they sent me\r\nalone. Now, let me have it.

"\r\n\r\nI shook my head. That was the one order they had given me--never to give\r\nthe Key to any one person who came alone.\r\n\r\nGremm became quite angry.\r\n\r\n"You idiot," he shouted. "Why do you think I had you put out here? It\r\nwas so I could get in there and help myself to the Treasure."\r\n\r\n"But that would be dishonest. And there are no dishonest people in the\r\nState."\r\n\r\n"For three thousand years. I know." His usually kind face had an ugly\r\nlook I had never seen before. 

"But I\'m going to get part of that\r\nTreasure. And it won\'t do you any good to report it, because no one is\r\ngoing to take the word of a fool like you, against a respected council\r\nmember. They\'ll think you are the dishonest one. Now, give me that Key!"\r\n\r\nIt\'s a terrible thing to disobey a council member. But if I obeyed him,\r\nI would be disobeying all the others. And that would be worse.\r\n\r\n"No!" I shouted.\r\n\r\nHe threw himself upon me. For his size and age, he was very\r\nstrong--stronger, even, than I. I fought as hard as I could, but I knew\r\nI wouldn\'t be able to keep him away from the Key for very long. And if\r\nhe took the Treasure, I would be blamed. The council would have to think\r\na new punishment for dishonesty. Whatever it was, it would be terrible,\r\nindeed.\r\n\r\nHe drew back and rushed at me. 

Just as he hit me, my foot caught upon a\r\nroot, and I fell. His rush carried him past me, and he crashed through\r\nthe brush screen beside the path. I heard him scream twice, then there\r\nwas silence.\r\n\r\nI was bruised all over, but I managed to pull myself up and take away\r\nwhat was left of the screen. There was no sign of Gremm, but my\r\nbeautiful pet was waving her pearl-green feelers as she always did in\r\nthanks for a good meal.\r\n\r\nThat\'s why I can\'t tell anyone what happened. No one would believe that\r\nGremm would be dishonest. And I can\'t prove it, because she ate the\r\nproof.\r\n\r\nEven if I did tell them, no one is going to believe that a fly-catcher\r\nplant--even a big one like mine--would actually be able to eat a man.\r\n\r\nSo they think that Gremm disappeared. And I\'m still out here--with her.\r\nShe\'s grown so much larger now, and more beautiful than ever.\r\n\r\nBut I hope she hasn\'t developed a taste for human flesh. Lately, when\r\nshe stretches out her feelers, it seems that she\'s trying to reach me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ August 1957.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

Only...._\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Worlds of If Science Fiction, January 1955.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Travelers from Outer Space dug into the pile of moldering\r\nrock, they found the metal capsule their senses had told them was\r\nthere. Battered and corroded though it was, the shadow vibrations\r\nshowed that it had once been smooth and shiny. As smooth, shiny and\r\nimpervious to wear as Twentieth Century Earth technology could make it.\r\n\r\nAt the time the Mayor of Chicago had ceremoniously tossed a handful\r\nof lake sand into the hole, had his picture taken smiling against\r\nthe skyline, and had moved away to let the workmen fill the hole with\r\ncement and place the marker, the Time Capsule had been bright with the\r\nhopes of civilization sending its proud present into the uncertain\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nTime passed....\r\n\r\nThe tiny radio transmitter in the capsule began throwing out its wide\r\nsignal at the exact instant planned for it many centuries before. No\r\none heard. 

Eventually, the tiny powerful batteries gave out. The signal\r\ndied.\r\n\r\nTime passed....\r\n\r\nWhen the Travelers from Outer Space took the capsule back to their ship\r\nand opened it, they found the contents in perfect order. Even the reel\r\nof magnetic tape had not succumbed to the centuries.\r\n\r\nIn due course, the Travelers examined the tape, divined its purpose,\r\nand constructed a machine that would play back the recording.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOut of a million evolutionary possibilities in a Universe of planets,\r\nthe chances of two intelligent races being even roughly similar are\r\nastronomically remote.\r\n\r\nA being develops sense organs for no other reason than to make it aware\r\nof its environment. The simplest primitive being\'s awareness of its\r\nenvironment centers around food, its means of survival. It develops\r\norgans and appendages that will enable it to ferret out, obtain and\r\ningest its food. As the food differs, so, then, does the eater.\r\n\r\nThe Travelers had no ears or eyes, as such. They had other organs for\r\nother purposes, but the net result was that they "saw" and "heard"\r\nquite as well--even better--than Earthmen.\r\n\r\nPerhaps that explains why the Travelers gleaned so much more from the\r\ntape recording in the Twentieth Century capsule than its originators\r\nhad planned or intended.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNot just any radio show could be placed in the Time Capsule. What\r\npicture of contemporary 1960 mankind would the men of the future derive\r\nfrom a soap opera? A news analysis? 

Or top comedy show? Certainly not\r\na flattering one, and so, reasoned the brass in charge of the project,\r\nnot a true one.\r\n\r\nNo, the only answer was to produce a special documentary program,\r\npainting on a broad canvas the glories that were the common man\'s\r\nbirthright in an enlightened democracy. As July 4th was only a\r\nmonth away, the idea was a natural. The program would be carried\r\nsimultaneously on four networks, then placed in the Time Capsule so\r\nthat historians of the future would have something solid on which to\r\nbase their conclusions.\r\n\r\nA famous poet-radio writer was hired to write the script. Hollywood\'s\r\ngreatest young male star donated his services (with much attendant\r\npublicity) as narrator. A self-acknowledged genius who directed radio\r\nshows for a living condescended to lend his talents to the production.\r\nNumerous other actors, musicians, technicians and assistants were\r\nhired ... none well-known, but all quite competent.\r\n\r\nJuly 4th, the big day, arrived. The cast went into rehearsal early in\r\nthe morning. 

By the second complete run-through, just before the break\r\nfor lunch, the show was hanging together nicely. After four hours of\r\npolishing in the afternoon, it was ready to go on the air. Everyone\'s\r\nnerves were raw, but the show sounded great.\r\n\r\nNaturally, when a room full of creative people have been rubbing\r\nagainst one another for a full day, a lot of emotions are generated.\r\nThe listening audience never knew about it, but it took the actors,\r\ndirectors, musicians and technicians several days to get the session\r\nout of their systems. During rehearsals, the young Hollywood star\r\ndeveloped a consuming lust for one of the minor actresses. One of the\r\nminor actors developed a consuming lust for the young Hollywood star.\r\nEveryone immediately hated the director, and he, lofty and all-wise,\r\ncontemptuously hated them in return. By eight o\'clock that night, show\r\ntime, the splendid documentary on the splendid American people was not\r\nthe only thing that was at peak pitch.\r\n\r\nIt was the only thing, however, that the radio audience heard. It was\r\nmagnificent. Future students hearing the tape could not but conclude\r\nthat here was the Golden Age. Man, at least American man, circa 1960,\r\nnoble, humble and sincere, was carrying in his bosom the seeds of\r\ngreatness. Difficulties still existed, of course, but they were not\r\ninsurmountable. 

A few deluded people seemed to be working against the\r\ncommon good, but the program left no doubt that this would be cleaned\r\nup in short order. The millenium was at hand!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the Travelers from Outer Space, who were a team of historians\r\ndoing research on the history of life throughout the Universe, listened\r\nto the tape recording, their "ears" heard none of the program as it had\r\nbeen originally broadcast. They were no less fascinated, however, for\r\nwhat they heard was the thought patterns of the people who had been\r\nconnected with the program. These thoughts, in the form of electrical\r\nimpulses, were also recorded on the magnetic surface of the tape, and\r\nwere the only sounds audible to the Travelers.\r\n\r\nWhat a pity these future historians didn\'t get mankind\'s version of\r\nthe life of mankind in 1960, after the producers had gone to so much\r\ntrouble to tie it up in a package for them. Their conception of Earth\r\nculture was based on the thought impulses they "heard", and their\r\nHistory of Earth was written accordingly. The last paragraph is worth\r\nnoting:\r\n\r\n"In the main, it is quite fortunate for life in the Universe that these\r\nprimitive people destroyed themselves before they learned how to leave\r\ntheir planet. Lustful, murderous and guilt-ridden, they are perhaps the\r\nworst examples of intelligent life that we have ever discovered. 

And\r\nyet, paradox supreme, they had one quality that we ourselves would do\r\nwell to emulate. That quality we can only surmise, for nothing on the\r\nrecording spoke of it, yet it is obvious, for if they hadn\'t had this\r\nquality, there would have been no recording left for us at all.\r\n\r\n"_How strange that these tortured people should practise an\r\nunparalleled example of Life\'s highest achievement ... complete honesty\r\nwith themselves and others._"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


And with good reason. Here was a man who\'d\r\nspent his life in a machine shop coming down one morning to say in all\r\napparent sincerity, "I\'ve decided to be a concert pianist."\r\n\r\nJan Grabowski, on the turret lathe grinned and said, "Sure, John.\r\nThey\'ll bring in a grand piano and you can practice between cuts."\r\n\r\n"They laughed when I sat down to the piano," someone bellowed and there\r\nwas general laughter and the thing was forgotten.\r\n\r\nBut later, when he told the boss he was quitting, they looked at each\r\nother in amazement. He\'d evidently gone mad and that was no laughing\r\nmatter because they liked John.\r\n\r\nSam Paine, harassed plant manager still found time to be human. When he\r\ndiscovered John was serious, he sat down and gave him half an hour,\r\nfiguring he could find the quirk and straighten the man out. As they\r\nwent to his office, he swiftly classified his employee: John Harper--33\r\nyears old--introverted--intelligent over and above his job. Harper\r\nseemed to be without ambition, though and Sam wondered about this but\r\nhad never had time to talk with him much.\r\n\r\nAfter the half hour was up, Paine sighed and let him go. Obviously the\r\nconcert pianist gag was a coverup for something else--some fancied\r\nwrong--perhaps plain restlessness.\r\n\r\nAlone, Paine went back over the conversation, intrigued by John\r\nHarper\'s strange determination.\r\n\r\n"This talk about being a concert pianist is a gag of course, isn\'t it,\r\nJohn?"\r\n\r\n"No, Mr. 

Paine."\r\n\r\n"But man--you\'re too old to start a thing like that. You never in your\r\nlife studied music did you?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir."\r\n\r\n"Then let me tell you--first, in a thing like that, you\'ve got to have\r\ntalent. Have you got talent?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know."\r\n\r\nIt had seemed ridiculous, seriously pinpointing things that should have\r\nbeen obvious. 

"Well let\'s say you have--just for argument\'s sake. 

All\r\nright--talent has to be caught early and nourished--like a seed--get\r\nwhat I mean? A man can\'t start at your age and get any place in a game\r\nthe experts started in at eight or nine--as children."\r\n\r\n"You may be right, Mr. 

Paine, but maybe that doesn\'t apply to me. Maybe\r\nit does, of course, but I\'ve got to find out."\r\n\r\nSam Paine gave up. He told John Harper his job would be waiting when\r\nhe wanted it again--even gave him an extra week\'s pay, but that was to\r\nsalve his conscience because he felt he should bring in a psychiatrist\r\nat company expense to see what had gone wrong with Harper. Then he\r\nshrugged and put the thing out of his mind. Funny things happen in this\r\nday and age, he thought.\r\n\r\nThe trouble was he didn\'t really know John Harper. No one did. A\r\nbachelor, Harper lived alone, thought alone--and suffered alone. He\r\nhated the futility of his life, the work he was doing, the passing of\r\nunfulfilled days and nights. He felt a strong pull of destiny he could\r\nneither explain nor deny; an unreasoning certainty that he, John Harper\r\nwas meant for better things; or perhaps a single better thing.\r\n\r\nHe lived with this certainty while the unfulfilled days and nights\r\npiled up. Until the misery became a pain and possibly demanded some\r\nsort of recognition by its very existence.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, the morning of the day he quit his job, he had just\r\nawakened to the old familiar dread of the day ahead; a dread almost\r\nakin to a physical sickness. 

He was sure he did not go back to sleep,\r\nbut he clearly saw, on the floor within range of his eyes, a television\r\nset. The picture was bright and clear--a famous newscaster with the\r\nsmile known from coast to coast and the rat-tat-tat voice that was his\r\ntrademark.\r\n\r\nHe was beginning his broadcast with the standard opening line: "_And\r\nnow, folks--what\'s been going on in the world? John Harper, the great\r\nconcert pianist--the man who brought long-hair music into the home--the\r\nman loved by millions, will--_"\r\n\r\nThe voice and the image vanished. Then the set faded, and John Harper\r\nlay tense in the bed in his shoddy little room. 

But a different John\r\nHarper now. In an instant he became a dedicated man knowing he had been\r\nbuilding up to this moment for years.\r\n\r\nThis was the incident Sam Paine did not know of; nor did anyone except\r\nJohn Harper himself. He had a little money saved up--a few hundred\r\ndollars--and he went straight to a music school. His difficulty was\r\nthat he could not camouflage his ambition--or rather his intent--and\r\nafter stating exactly what he proposed to do, he was turned down by\r\nfive reputable maestros in a row.\r\n\r\nSo he gave up seeking instruction and rented a piano. He was\r\nfortunately situated in that his room lay at the back of the resident\r\nhotel where he lived and the walls were as thick as the building was\r\nold and shoddy looking.\r\n\r\nHe bought some instruction books at a second hand store and went to\r\nwork. He practiced, plowing doggedly through the intricacies of the\r\nnotes and scales until his money ran out. Then he got a job washing\r\ndishes and practiced all night.\r\n\r\nUntil he was able to present himself again at a music school where the\r\nmaestro was, fortunately, both honest and possessed of a conscience.\r\nHis honesty said, send this man away. But John Harper had just enough\r\npathetic skill and foggy talent that the instructor\'s conscience\r\ndictated the final policy.\r\n\r\n"I will teach you," he said. Adding to himself, _It will be an act of\r\ncharity. Nothing more._ He would have been astounded, however, had he\r\nknown that four short months before John Harper had not known even the\r\nscale.\r\n\r\nJohn told no one this. He told no one anything. But he applied himself\r\nto the piano with a single-mindedness that made a fanatic seem\r\nchangeable as the wind by comparison.\r\n\r\nAnd soon, Professor Heinrich, he of the conscience, was confronted with\r\nsomething he could not understand. Genius was blooming and functioning\r\nbefore his eyes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe rest is history. It is told in hushed tones how this sad-faced,\r\nmiddle-aged man with no background--he was called "The Man From\r\nNowhere," by certain romantically inclined critics--gave his first\r\nrecital in New York City. It was given exactly seven years from the day\r\nhe told Sam Paine, "I\'m quitting to become a concert pianist."\r\n\r\nThe television networks found him quickly and he rocketed to fame by\r\ngiving classical music an interpretation that made it understood and\r\nloved by millions.\r\n\r\nIt was said that John Harper gave more musical pleasure to the world in\r\nhis brief two-year career than had any other genius in a natural span.\r\n\r\nBut of course, the seven years had taken their toll. The punishment of\r\nlearning would have killed a far younger and stronger man than John\r\nHarper. So, after a tragically brief time at the top of his ladder,\r\nJohn Harper was the subject of a newscast.\r\n\r\nBy a famous newscaster with the smile famous from coast-to-coast and a\r\nrat-tat-tat voice that was his trademark.\r\n\r\nBut not smiling as he finished his first item. "_--be buried tomorrow\r\nin New York City._"\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\nI lit the last cigarette I would ever smoke and took my airsuit out\r\nof the compartment under the control-board. The two-man cubicle was\r\ncoffin-cold even under the blast of sunlight pouring through the\r\nforward port, and the air smelled of stale tobacco and machine oil.\r\nBeside me Charlie Kosta\'s voice droned into the communicator, winging\r\nback two-hundred thirty thousand miles to the listening millions of\r\nEarth.\r\n\r\n"Our air is nearly gone," Charlie said. "We have about twelve minutes\r\nleft for deceleration, but we\'ll never make landing. The Luna V is\r\nriddled like a sieve, spewing out heavy-water fuel along with her\r\nair ... it\'s a miracle that a chunk hasn\'t crashed through our fuel\r\npile or the communicator--or through us. That\'s what blew up the first\r\nfour ships, we know now ... if men ever reach the moon they\'ll first\r\nhave to develop some sort of armor that will turn this barrage of\r\nmeteoric dust."\r\n\r\nI got my feet into the plastoid suit and pulled it on, letting\r\nthe transparent headpiece dangle over one shoulder like a parka\r\nhood. Charlie watched me with his tight grin, waiting through the\r\nthree-second lag of time for Earth\'s answer. Some high-ranking general\r\ndown there had pushed aside the Moon Foundation scientists to make\r\nhimself heard; his voice came over the hiss of static with a tinny,\r\nfrantic ring.\r\n\r\n"_Meteoric dust couldn\'t possibly pierce that alloy hull! It was tested\r\nover and over--_"\r\n\r\nWe waited him out, knowing that his frenzy was not for us nor for the\r\nsuccess of space flight. He was concerned, like all the military,\r\nonly with the establishing of a moon base to overlook Earth, an\r\nall-commanding launching site that would control a world. Once that\r\nbase was established, the ferment of war would come to a bitter end;\r\none nation would own the planet.\r\n\r\n"But you didn\'t test the hull out here," Charlie said patiently when\r\nthe general had finished. "You can\'t imagine the _speed_ of these\r\nparticles. We\'ve no protecting atmosphere to vaporize them, as Earth\r\nhas, and they streak through the ship so fast that they seem to strike\r\nboth sides of the hull at once.... I\'m cutting you over to Leonard\r\nNugent now. Ready, Len?

"\r\n\r\nIt was what I was waiting for. I had looked forward to this moment\r\nevery day of the nine years I had spent being groomed for the flight,\r\nand for half a lifetime of drilling before that. The waiting was almost\r\nover.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"I\'m ready," I said, and took the microphone. 

"But there\'s not much\r\npoint in reporting further, is there? With her fuel leaks the Luna V\r\nwill go like an A-bomb the instant we try to use the landing jets,\r\njust as the first four Lunas did ... the air is getting thinner, so\r\nthin that I\'ll have to put on my pressure suit soon. Are there any\r\nquestions?"\r\n\r\nMy only answer was the grind and roar of static.\r\n\r\nI could guess why; they were bickering and quarrelling among themselves\r\ndown there, the military men snarling at the scientists and the\r\nscientists snarling back, each blaming the other for this new failure.\r\nThe loss of the first four ships had been a mystery until they sent the\r\nLuna V out with co-pilots, equipped for full two-way communication.\r\nCharlie and I had reported from the beginning of the flight in\r\nalternate thirty-minute relays, keeping the Foundation posted so that\r\nif anything threatened us they would know the nature of the danger. Now\r\nthey were getting what they had asked for, and the problem would keep\r\nthem busy for another ten or fifteen years while the conquest of space\r\nmarked time. But they couldn\'t accept even temporary defeat calmly,\r\nof course--they had to quarrel among themselves, just as men have\r\nquarrelled since they first climbed down out of their trees and set\r\nabout organizing the business of killing each other.\r\n\r\n"We\'re going to try for a landing anyway," I said into the microphone.\r\n"We\'re going to cut in the decelerator jets as soon as we pass out of\r\nthe sun glare and into the moon\'s penumbra, where we can see."\r\n\r\nWe flashed suddenly into darkness, lost instantly in the vast conical\r\nshadow of the moon. The night half of the pocked globe loomed below,\r\nfaint and ghostly in the blue Earthshine, craggy and desolate, cold\r\nas space and as old as time. Earth hung above and behind us, and I\r\ncouldn\'t help thinking of the astronomers who had followed our flight\r\npatiently every inch of the way. They couldn\'t see us now; the daylight\r\ncrescent of the moon lay between the Luna V and the sun, burying us\r\ndeep in the utter darkness of space.\r\n\r\nCharlie took the microphone, speaking this time not to the Foundation\r\nbut to the millions who sat gaping at their radios. Some of them would\r\nbe muttering maudlin prayers for our safety, some would be gleefully\r\ncollecting the bets they had made on our chances of getting across; all\r\nof them would be thrilled to the core by the vicarious imminence of\r\ndanger and death.\r\n\r\n"We don\'t want mourning and demonstrations," Charlie said. "If you\r\npeople listening to me would like to honor our memory and the memory of\r\nthe men lost before us, then forget space travel for a while and try to\r\nwork out a lasting peace down there on Earth. Because it\'s inevitable\r\nthat you\'ll conquer space some day, and if you aren\'t ready for it when\r\nit comes--"\r\n\r\nHe clicked off the communicator, and we turned to the port together to\r\nwatch the little metal sphere that hurtled up out of the darkness past\r\nthe Luna V. From behind and above us there came a great white flash of\r\natomic fire that must have blinded for the moment every watching eye on\r\nEarth.\r\n\r\n"Right on schedule," Charlie said, and swung the Luna V over the\r\ndarkside rim and across the mysterious other side of the moon, the\r\nhidden hemisphere that no man has ever seen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe ship was waiting for us there, a sleek, familiar cylinder with\r\nairlock standing open.\r\n\r\nWe went inside and closed the lock and stripped off our cumbersome\r\nairsuits, and Charlie flexed his arms and grinned at me. "Lord, I\'m\r\nglad to get that over with--it\'s been like nine years of prison!

"\r\n\r\n"It was worth it," I said. I was remembering the grim green world we\r\nhad left, shivering a little when I considered the brawling simian\r\nhordes who battered their way up the scale toward a culture that\r\nmight, unchecked, some day rule the Universe.\r\n\r\n"It gives us a few more years before they come swarming down on us with\r\ntheir atomic bombs and politics and their gaping tourists," I said,\r\nstill using the speech patterns that had been drilled into me for half\r\nmy life. "We\'ve marked time long enough, hoping for the best. 

We\'ll\r\nneed every minute we\'ve gained to get ready for them.

"\r\n\r\nWe went forward then to watch the purple-skinned pilot, hairy and\r\nmany-limbed and beautifully wrinkled, engage the magnetic drive that\r\nwould send us flashing toward the planet that was home. Later, in our\r\nnatural bodies, we would speak the name of that world with reverence,\r\nbut our clumsy synthetic Earth-tongues could not master its lovely\r\nsonic extensions, and so we used another term.\r\n\r\nFor the time being, we called it Mars....\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


The charred stumps. The jungle beyond--the visible mask of those\r\nmonstrous genes--rank, dark, utterly alien.\r\n\r\nAt the third dawn, Lance Llandark took two of us out in a \'copter.\r\nFlying a grid over the landing area, we mapped six shallow pock-marks\r\non that scowling wilderness, where our ships must have landed.\r\n\r\nWe dropped into the newest crater, where black stumps jutted like\r\nbroken teeth out of queerly bare red muck. A yellow-scummed stream\r\noozed across it. By the stream we found a fine-boned human skeleton.\r\n\r\nA nightmare plant stood guard beside the bones. Its thick leaves were\r\nstrangely streaked, twisted with vegetable agony, half poison spine and\r\nhalf blighted bloom. Shapeless blobs of rotting fruit were falling from\r\nit over those slender bones.\r\n\r\nLance Llandark stood up.\r\n\r\n"Her turquoise thunderbird." He showed us the bit of blackened silver\r\nand blue-veined stone. "Back on Terra.... Back when we were student\r\npilots.... We bought it from an Indian in an old, old town called Sante\r\nFe."\r\n\r\nHe bent again.\r\n\r\n"Lilith?" 

he whispered. "Lilith, what killed you?"\r\n\r\nWe found no other bones, nothing even to tell us what force or poison\r\nkept the creeping jungle back from that solitary plant. We left at\r\ndusk. Tenderly, Lance Llandark brought the gathered bones. Carefully we\r\ncarried a few leaves and dried pods from that crazy sentinel plant. We\r\nfound no other clue.\r\n\r\nPatiently, day by forty-hour day, we searched the other sites. We found\r\njet marks and stumps and teeming weeds, but nothing like that tormented\r\nnightmare over Lilith Llandark\'s skeleton. We found no wreckage.\r\nNothing to show how the planet had murdered the lost expeditions.\r\n\r\nDay by eternal day, the unknown leered from the secret places of its\r\ngenes. It was all vegetable. 

We saw no animal movement, heard no cry or\r\ninsect hum. The silence became suffocating.\r\n\r\nDay after desperate day, we returned to the micro-probe.\r\n\r\n"The answer\'s in the genes," Lance Llandark whispered grimly. "We\'ve no\r\nother chance."\r\n\r\nHe kept the probe running on the strangest genes of all; those from the\r\nplant nightmare that had grown beside his wife. They were like nothing\r\nelse on the planet. The double-stranded chains of DNA were monstrously\r\nlong; many of the nucleotide links held copper or arsenic atoms.\r\n\r\n"Queer!" Lance kept muttering. "No copper or arsenic in other plants\r\nhere. I\'d like to know why.

"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe was running when we heard the woman scream. In that stifling quiet,\r\nher cry unnerved us all. We crowded down to the lock.\r\n\r\nTattered, stained with blood-colored juices, she slipped through those\r\ncoiled, constricting creepers. She splashed out into the open ditch,\r\nwaving a filthy rag. Halfway to the ship, she fell into the mud.\r\n\r\nLance Llandark led three of us to bring her in. She whimpered and\r\nlooked up. Tears streaked the grime on her wasted face.\r\n\r\n"Lance!" she gasped. 

"My dear."\r\n\r\n"Lilith--" But he shrank back suddenly. "I found Lilith dead!"\r\n\r\n"I am nearly dead." She tried weakly to get up. "You see, we\'re all\r\nmarooned out there in the bush. Emergency landing, when we tried to get\r\noff. Wrecked our astrogation gear. Need your spare astro-pilot--"\r\n\r\n"Back." He swung on us. "Back aboard!

"\r\n\r\n"What\'s wrong?" We were stunned, "She\'s your wife--"\r\n\r\n"Aboard! Instanter!"\r\n\r\nWe obeyed his deadly voice.\r\n\r\n"Help--" she whispered faintly behind us in the mud. "Survivors--need\r\nastro-pilot-to plot our way home--"\r\n\r\nThe clanging lock cut off her voice.\r\n\r\nAngrily we turned on Lance Llandark.\r\n\r\n"Hold it!" he snapped. 

"I\'m not crazy--the planet is. Come along to the\r\nmicro-probe. I\'m probing a seed from the plant we found by Lilith\'s\r\nbones. It puzzled me. So much of it was--"\r\n\r\nIn spite of the tension, he had to grope for a word to express meaning.\r\n\r\n"Arbitrary! Those shapeless leaves, twisted stalk, that sterile seed.\r\nThe copper and arsenic in those needless links. Too many genes had no\r\nfunction. No use at all!\r\n\r\n"I\'d just got the key, when that thing screamed. The copper and arsenic\r\natoms are not genetic instructions to the plant. They\'re a message to\r\nus--words replicated a trillion times, and concealed in every cell of\r\nthe plant!"\r\n\r\n"Words?" someone whispered blankly. "Words in the atoms?"\r\n\r\n"Written in binary code." His scowl was bleakly triumphant. "That\r\nweed\'s a mutant, you see. The real Lilith formed the first cell with\r\nher micro-probe. She left it--I suppose in her own body--as a message\r\nthat no pseudo-Lilith could intercept."\r\n\r\nOutside that something screamed again.\r\n\r\n"Call each copper atom a dot," he whispered. "Call each arsenic a dash.\r\nTaken in order along the chains of DNA, they do encode a message. 

The\r\ncomputer\'s decoding it now."\r\n\r\nHe punched a button, and the printer whirred.\r\n\r\nTO WHOEVER COMES.... GIVE NO AID TO ANYONE.... GET OFF THIS PLANET....\r\nITS LIFE IS PSEUDOMORPHIC.... DON\'T LET IT LEAVE.... JUST TAKE MY\r\nLOVE TO LANCE LLANDARK.... FROM LILITH, HIS WIFE.... AND GET OFF THIS\r\nPLANET, FAST....\r\n\r\nOutside, it uttered a frantic, bubbling screech.\r\n\r\nWe did get off the planet, and we expect to stay away.\r\n\r\nEND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


"Thank you. 

But, dammit, I\r\nwish you didn\'t have that everlasting smile!"\r\n\r\n"I am very sorry, Miss Alice, but I am unable to alter myself in any\r\nway," replied Herbert in his polite, hollow voice.\r\n\r\nHe retired to a corner and stood impassively, still holding the tray.\r\nHerbert had found a silver deposit and made the tray. Herbert had found\r\nsand and made the cocktail glass. Herbert had combined God knew what\r\natmospheric and earth chemicals to make what tasted like gin and\r\nvermouth, and Herbert had frozen the ice to chill it.\r\n\r\n"Sometimes," said Thera wistfully, "it occurs to me it would be better\r\nto live in a mud hut with a real man than in a mansion with Herbert."\r\n\r\nThe four women lolled comfortably in the living room of their spacious\r\nhouse, as luxurious as anything any of them would have known on distant\r\nEarth. The rugs were thick, the furniture was overstuffed, the paintings\r\non the walls were aesthetic and inspiring, the shelves were filled with\r\nbooktapes and musictapes.\r\n\r\nHerbert had done it all, except the booktapes and musictapes, which had\r\nbeen salvaged from the wrecked spaceship.\r\n\r\n"Do you suppose we\'ll ever escape from this best of all possible manless\r\nworlds?" asked Betsy, fluffing her thick black hair with her fingers and\r\ninspecting herself in a Herbert-made mirror.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see how," answered blond Alice glumly. "That atmospheric trap\r\nwould wreck any other ship just as it wrecked ours, and the same\r\nmagnetic layer prevents any radio message from getting out. 

No, I\'m\r\nafraid we\'re a colony."\r\n\r\n"A colony perpetuates itself," reminded sharp-faced Marguerite, acidly.\r\n"We aren\'t a colony, without men."\r\n\r\nThey were not the prettiest four women in the universe, nor the\r\nyoungest. The prettiest women and the youngest did not go to space. But\r\nthey were young enough and healthy enough, or they could not have gone\r\nto space.\r\n\r\nIt had been a year and a half now--an Earth year and a half on a nice\r\nlittle planet revolving around a nice little yellow sun. Herbert, the\r\nrobot, was obedient and versatile and had provided them with a house,\r\nfood, clothing, anything they wished created out of the raw elements of\r\nearth and air and water. But the bones of all the men who had been\r\naspace with these four ladies lay mouldering in the wreckage of their\r\nspaceship.\r\n\r\nAnd Herbert could not create a man. Herbert did not have to have direct\r\norders, and he had tried once to create a man when he had overheard them\r\nwishing for one. They had buried the corpse--perfect in every detail\r\nexcept that it never had been alive.\r\n\r\n"It\'s been a hot day," said Alice, fanning her brow. "I wish it would\r\nrain."\r\n\r\nSilently, Herbert moved from his corner and went out the door.\r\n\r\nMarguerite gestured after him with a bitter little laugh.\r\n\r\n"It\'ll rain this afternoon," she said. "I don\'t know how Herbert does\r\nit--maybe with silver iodide. But it\'ll rain. Wouldn\'t it have been\r\nsimpler to get him to air-condition the house, Alice?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s a good idea," said Alice thoughtfully. "We should have had him\r\ndo it before."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHerbert had not quite completed the task of air-conditioning the house\r\nwhen the other spaceship crashed. They all rushed out to the smoking\r\nsite--the four women and Herbert.\r\n\r\nIt was a tiny scoutship, and its single occupant was alive.\r\n\r\nHe was unconscious, but he was alive. And he was a man!\r\n\r\nThey carted him back to the house, tenderly, and put him to bed. They\r\nhovered over him like four hens over a single chick, waiting and\r\nwatching for him to come out of his coma, while Herbert scurried about\r\ncreating and administering the necessary medicines.\r\n\r\n"He\'ll live," said Thera happily. Thera had been a space nurse. "He\'ll\r\nbe on his feet and walking around in a few weeks.

"\r\n\r\n"A man!" 

murmured Betsy, with something like awe in her voice. "I could\r\nalmost believe Herbert brought him here in answer to our prayers."\r\n\r\n"Now, girls," said Alice, "we have to realize that a man brings\r\nproblems, as well as possibilities."\r\n\r\nThere was a matter-of-fact hardness to her tone which almost masked the\r\nquiver behind it. There was a defiant note of competition there which\r\nhad not been heard on this little planet before.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" asked Thera.\r\n\r\n"I know what she means," said Marguerite, and the new hardness came\r\nnatural to her. "She means, which one of us gets him?"\r\n\r\nBetsy, the youngest, gasped, and her mouth rounded to a startled O.\r\nThera blinked, as though she were coming out of a daze.\r\n\r\n"That\'s right," said Alice. "Do we draw straws, or do we let him\r\nchoose?"\r\n\r\n"Couldn\'t we wait?" suggested Betsy timidly. 

"Couldn\'t we wait until he\r\ngets well?"\r\n\r\nHerbert came in with a new thermometer and poked it into the unconscious\r\nman\'s mouth. He stood by the bed, waiting patiently.\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t think we can," said Alice. "I think we ought to have it all\r\nworked out and agreed on, so there won\'t be any dispute about it."\r\n\r\n"I say, draw straws," said Marguerite. Marguerite\'s face was thin, and\r\nshe had a skinny figure.\r\n\r\nBetsy, the youngest, opened her mouth, but Thera forestalled her.\r\n\r\n"We are not on Earth," she said firmly, in her soft, mellow voice. "We\r\ndon\'t have to follow terrestrial customs, and we shouldn\'t. 

There\'s only\r\none solution that will keep everybody happy--all of us and the man.

"\r\n\r\n"And that is...?" asked Marguerite drily.\r\n\r\n"Polygamy, of course. He must belong to us all."\r\n\r\nBetsy shuddered but, surprisingly, she nodded.\r\n\r\n"That\'s well and good," agreed Marguerite, "but we have to agree that no\r\none of us will be favored above the others. He has to understand that\r\nfrom the start."\r\n\r\n"That\'s fair," said Alice, pursing her lips. "Yes, that\'s fair. But I\r\nagree with Marguerite: he must be divided equally among the four of us."\r\n\r\nChattering over the details, the hard competitiveness vanished from\r\ntheir tones, the four left the sickroom to prepare supper.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter supper they went back in.\r\n\r\nHerbert stood by the bed, the eternal smile of service on his metal\r\nface. As always, Herbert had not required a direct command to accede to\r\ntheir wishes.\r\n\r\nThe man was divided into four quarters, one for each of them. It was a\r\nvery neat surgical job.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                   END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _If Worlds of Science Fiction_ June\r\n    1958.

]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sign on the door said Ernest H. Smith, Private Investigator.\r\nThe door opened and a woman came in. She was a brunette, about\r\nfive-feet-two, wearing a yellow dress with black buttons. She carried a\r\nbrown alligator handbag. "I am Mrs. Wilma Rogers," she said. "You were\r\nrecommended to me."\r\n\r\nSmith motioned to a chair in front of his desk. "Sit down, Mrs. Rogers.\r\nDo you have a card?"\r\n\r\nShe sat down and opened her handbag. She took out a small card and\r\nhanded it to him. He looked at the printed words, "Recommended to\r\nSmith." He opened a desk drawer and removed a small bottle of red\r\nliquid, spilling a few drops on the blank side of the card. Soon there\r\nwas visible writing on it. 

"Okay for any service," it said.\r\n\r\n"All right," Smith nodded, "what can I do for you?"\r\n\r\n"I want you to kill my husband," she said pleasantly.\r\n\r\nSmith swiveled his chair around to face the typewriter, inserted a\r\nblank sheet of white paper, and began to type. "Why do you want him\r\nkilled?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s stingy--he won\'t give me enough money."\r\n\r\n"How much money will he leave you, Mrs. Rogers?"\r\n\r\n"Roughly two hundred thousand," she said. "There\'s insurance, of\r\ncourse, but I understand we can\'t count on that."\r\n\r\nSmith smiled. 

"That\'s a nice sum. Now what time would be most\r\nconvenient?"\r\n\r\nShe shrugged her shoulders. "Any time suits me."\r\n\r\nSmith laughed. "I mean for your husband. What time would be best for\r\nkilling him?"\r\n\r\n"Oh," she said. Her brow wrinkled and she began to mutter, "Let\'s see,\r\nnow ... home at five-fifteen, reads the paper ... takes a shower ...\r\ndinner at six-fifteen ... I can send the servants out at\r\nseven-thirty ... oh, I think eight will be perfect."\r\n\r\n"Eight it is," said Smith, putting the information on paper. "Now for a\r\nbit of information about the house and grounds. Can\'t afford to bungle\r\ninto the wrong place and foul up the job."\r\n\r\nMrs. Rogers opened her purse again and withdrew a folded sheet of\r\npaper. "I\'ve got a floor-plan of the house here, with the address and\r\neverything marked off."\r\n\r\nSmith took the paper and looked at it. "You don\'t overlook anything, do\r\nyou? Why didn\'t you just go ahead and do the job yourself?"\r\n\r\nShe smiled and shrugged. "I understand you can perform a perfect\r\nmurder. I\'m afraid I couldn\'t."\r\n\r\nSmith removed the typewritten sheet from the machine and inserted a\r\nfresh sheet. He filled it in with names, dates, and figures. When he\r\nfinished he handed it to her. "Sign on the bottom line."\r\n\r\nShe took the paper and looked at it.\r\n\r\n"It\'s our contract," said Smith. "I have to have a guarantee that\r\nyou\'ll go through with your part of the bargain. If you don\'t, I\'ll\r\nhave that signed confession."\r\n\r\nMrs. Rogers looked at him in silence for a moment, then she laughed and\r\nsigned the paper. 

"You don\'t overlook anything, yourself."\r\n\r\n"No, Ma\'am," said Smith.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt exactly five minutes before eight, Smith drove his panel truck\r\nthrough the gate to the Rogers home, turned out the lights, and drove\r\nsilently to the house. He parked near the side entrance, got out, went\r\naround the truck, which was labeled, "Smith\'s TV Repair," and opened\r\nthe back doors. He lifted a pile of ragged quilts from the floor and\r\npicked up a small air-pistol. Wrapped carefully in the quilts was a\r\ntiny bottle of dark green liquid, marked "Poison." He took a small\r\ndart from his pocket, opened the bottle and applied a small amount of\r\nthe liquid to the tip of the projectile. Then he loaded the pistol with\r\nthe dart, stuck it in his coat pocket, and replaced the bottle.\r\n\r\nHe walked rapidly to the door of the house, stopped at the steps to\r\nconsult the floor-plan, and then entered. He went up the stairs and\r\ndirectly to the second door on the left. He turned the knob silently\r\nand eased inside.\r\n\r\nA small man, dressed in a dark suit, was seated at a desk, writing with\r\na fountain pen on light blue paper. He looked up and said, "Who are\r\nyou?

"\r\n\r\n"I\'m Smith, the TV repairman--are you Rogers?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but I--"\r\n\r\nThen Smith killed him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe emerged from the house with Rogers draped over his shoulder and\r\nstaggered over to the truck. He shoved the corpse in and crawled in\r\nafter. Moving rapidly, he opened the door of a trim metal cabinet\r\ndirectly behind the cab and shoved Rogers inside. Then he pushed a\r\nbutton on the side of the contraption and it began to hum.\r\n\r\nAfter two minutes he cut the power and opened the cabinet. It was empty.\r\n\r\nSmith whistled softly as he walked back to the house. He strode noisily\r\nin and called, "Hey, Mrs. Rogers!"\r\n\r\nShe emerged from a door near the head of the stairs and came down.\r\n"Yes?" she said.\r\n\r\nSmith grinned at her. "It\'s okay, lady--the job is over."\r\n\r\n"Good! Let me fix you a drink, and you can tell me all about it."\r\n\r\nSmith sat down on a couch. 

She prepared the drinks and brought his\r\nover. They sat together and sipped the liquor.\r\n\r\n"Science is wonderful," she said.\r\n\r\n"Yeah, it sure is," said Smith. "They spend millions figuring out fancy\r\nways to catch crooks, and then some dumb professor invents a way so I\r\ncan kill people and never be caught."\r\n\r\n"I wonder what the cops a hundred years in the future will think when\r\nbodies start popping up all over the place?" she observed.\r\n\r\n"Who cares?" 

said Smith. "I\'m making my dough, even if I will have to\r\nwait seven years for the heirs to collect."\r\n\r\n"It won\'t be too hard to wait," she said, "since we know for certain\r\nwe\'ll get it."\r\n\r\n"Let\'s drink to our success," Smith said.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s," she smiled.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s to a fine old professor, who invented a time machine and\r\nkindly let me kill him and take it away. Here\'s to a policeman\'s\r\nnightmare--the perfect murder."\r\n\r\nThey drank.\r\n\r\nSmith got to his feet then and put the glass down. "Well, I\'ve got to\r\ngo now, I--"\r\n\r\nHe saw the blank look of astonishment on her face. Her mouth had\r\ndropped open and her eyes were wide, staring. But they weren\'t looking\r\nat him--they were looking _behind_ him.\r\n\r\nAnd then he heard the polite cough.\r\n\r\nSmith spun around. He stared in amazement at the figure of a man\r\nstanding there. A man clad in a strange shimmering metallic uniform.\r\nThe man held an odd-looking weapon in his hand. He was smiling.\r\n\r\n"Mr. 

Smith, I believe?"\r\n\r\nSmith nodded automatically. "Yes, but who--"\r\n\r\n"--am I?" the stranger completed the sentence for him. "It\'s quite\r\nsimple. I\'m Inspector Graevod, homicide. I\'m arresting you for murder."\r\n\r\nSmith shook his head dully. 

"But that\'s impossible. There\'s no\r\nmurder--no body.... Where did you come from?"\r\n\r\nThe shimmering man smiled pleasantly. "Oh but there is a body. Matter\r\nof fact there are quite a few. We\'ve had quite a bit of difficulty in\r\ntracing you down. I\'ve come all the way from 2035 to find you." He\r\nturned his eyes to the woman. "As an accessory to the fact you are also\r\nunder arrest. 

Come along, both of you.

"\r\n\r\nHe pointed the strange weapon at them and a silver radiance swept from\r\nit to envelope their bodies.\r\n\r\nBut only for a moment. Then they were gone....\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt\'s still very clear in my mind. 

The whole episode. The afternoon\r\nvisit to Marsten\'s office, the trip to Mars, and the journey back.\r\n\r\nIt was one of those warm summer afternoons. All one craved for was a\r\npatch of green grass to recline on and maybe a faint breeze to tingle\r\none\'s forehead. I was sure of the grass and hopeful for the breeze.\r\nBut one of Marsten\'s messengers popped up and the grass and the breeze\r\nwould have to wait. After all, Marsten was my boss.\r\n\r\nHe had his office in the Empire State Building. Norbert Marsten was the\r\nowner of the Marsten Circus, the greatest, biggest, loudest circus in\r\nthe world. And if you don\'t believe it, ask Mr. Marsten.\r\n\r\n"Sit down, Nick," he invited, speaking from one corner of his mouth as\r\nthe other corner was busy chewing a dollar cigar. Marsten was a small\r\nman with sleek black, hair. A small man with big ideas.\r\n\r\nI sat down.\r\n\r\n"Nick, you\'re the best \'bring \'em back alive\' man I\'ve got. The best.

"\r\n\r\nThis was very true. "You\'ve got a job for me," I said.\r\n\r\n"That\'s correct."\r\n\r\n"So why the buildup? Tell me what you want."\r\n\r\n"I want something that no other circus has."\r\n\r\n"You must be kidding. You have every known animal there is. Why, the\r\nbushmaster I brought you two months ago is the longest--"\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t exactly an animal I want."\r\n\r\n"Oh? You mean you want a performer? What the hell have I got to do--"\r\n\r\n"What I want is out of this world."\r\n\r\n"A different kind of act? I still say--"\r\n\r\n"I want a Martian."\r\n\r\nI was glad I didn\'t have a mirror in front of my face. I could imagine\r\nhow foolish I looked with my mouth hanging open.\r\n\r\n"I even have a name picked out for him," Marsten persisted. "Marty, the\r\nMartian. What do you think of that?"\r\n\r\nI stood up slowly. "Let me know when you\'ve recovered."\r\n\r\nMarsten came around the desk. "Sit down. 

Now listen to me. Did you ever\r\nhear of a man named Hendrick Ritter?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"The greatest scientist in the world. He\'s been working for me for over\r\na year. I hired him to do one particular job for me: to concoct a fuel\r\nthat will get a space ship to Mars and back. Well, it\'s done. Did you\r\never hear of a man named Sam Young?"\r\n\r\n"Same answer as before."\r\n\r\n"He\'s a designer for air ships. The best in the business. 

He\'s finished\r\na job for me. And, Nick, it\'s already built. 

And I\'ve got Joe Roane\r\nworking for me."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve heard of him," I said.\r\n\r\n"The greatest pilot in the world," Marsten said.\r\n\r\n"The greatest this, the greatest that. And for what? 

Why, the ship\r\nprobably won\'t get off the ground."\r\n\r\nMarsten chewed furiously on his cigar. "But what if it does get off\r\nthe ground? What if it does get to Mars?"\r\n\r\n"All right. So what? How do you know there\'s life on Mars?"\r\n\r\n"There is. I hired the greatest--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," I groaned. "I believe you, I believe you. 

So now we\'re on\r\nMars."\r\n\r\n"You capture a Martian and bring him back."\r\n\r\n"What if he doesn\'t care to be captured?"\r\n\r\n"What do I pay you for?"\r\n\r\nI thought this out, then said, "To capture Martians."\r\n\r\n"Exactly."\r\n\r\n"You wouldn\'t settle for a moon maiden, would you? I heard they\'re\r\ncute. 

And sexy."\r\n\r\n"A Martian." He was very adamant. "I\'ll have the greatest attraction in\r\nthe world. Nick, I\'m the kind who gets what he wants. I\'ve spent over\r\nthree million dollars on this project and I\'m ready to spend another\r\nthree million. Just get me my Martian and you\'ll be a rich man. You\'ll\r\nbe rich enough to quit working for me and to tell me to go to hell.\r\nYou\'d like that, wouldn\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"I\'d like that very much."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwo weeks later we went to Arizona. A week after that we took off. I\r\ndidn\'t really think we would. But we did.\r\n\r\nJust me and Joe Roane. Two men in a space ship.\r\n\r\nA huge metal tube hurtling through the longest and blackest of nights.\r\n\r\nJoe Roane was a good-looking chap. Good-looking, young, and excited.\r\nHe was the first to pilot a ship to Mars. He was looking ahead to the\r\nglory that awaited him.\r\n\r\nWe landed on Mars.\r\n\r\nWe put on helmets that Ritter and Young had made for us. We stepped\r\ndown the metal ladder.\r\n\r\nThey were there, waiting for us.\r\n\r\nI\'d rather have faced a bushmaster or a rhino.\r\n\r\nThey stood on three legs. They had globe bellies, tiny heads, and no\r\nnecks. They were of a color I had never seen before. They had two arms\r\nwith two hands attached to each arm. I suppose they were hands. They\r\nwere more like claws.\r\n\r\nI stood frozen solid. Joe Roane screamed and turned to run back up the\r\nladder. A beam flashed and Joe fell forward, silent and very dead.\r\n\r\nAfter that it was all a blank.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to I was strapped down by metal clasps on a long board made\r\nof some kind of marble. I was alone for some time.\r\n\r\nI don\'t remember how long it was before one of them appeared. 

He stood\r\nby my side, looking down at me. His eyes were purple. 

There were no\r\nwhites. "You have come a long way," he said.\r\n\r\n"You--you speak English?"\r\n\r\n"We used a 64-V machine on you. We learned your language, your\r\nthoughts, your name. We know about Norbert Marsten. A very enterprising\r\nman, it seems."\r\n\r\n"What are you going to do with me?"\r\n\r\n"We haven\'t decided yet. So you were going to take one of us back with\r\nyou for Marsten\'s circus. To exhibit one of us to your stupid race. My\r\nfollowers wanted to kill you when this information was learned. But I\r\nbelieve I have a better idea."\r\n\r\nHe went away. I yelled for him to come back. I yelled till my throat\r\nwas dry. Eventually he did come back. He came back with Joe Roane\r\nand ... myself.\r\n\r\n"I want you to meet Klar and Grat," he said. "They have taken over\r\nyour bodies; you will take theirs--and return to Marsten. We have\r\na transformer machine to accomplish this. Only we never had an\r\nopportunity to use it until you were so gracious as to visit us." He\r\nspoke on, telling me of his idea. I shuddered and wished for death. I\r\nbegged him to kill me.\r\n\r\nThen a contraption was fitted over me and it hummed and I passed out. I\r\nremember the trip back to earth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI\'m no longer Nick Faber. I\'m Marty the Martian. What a cute title\r\nMarsten had hung on me. I\'ve got a nice home and I get plenty to eat.\r\nOnly my home is a cage and it\'s made of glass. People come from all\r\nover the world just to see me. And Marsten has been to see me every\r\nday. He chews on his big cigar and there\'s a smile on his face a yard\r\nwide.\r\n\r\nI\'ve tried to talk to my keepers but all I can manage is some crazy\r\nkind of gibberish. I also see Klar and Grat. But they\'re only there\r\nwhen Marsten is around. They\'re keeping very close to him. My being\r\ntransformed into a Martian was just part of it. Klar and Grat were\r\ngoing to carry out the rest of it.\r\n\r\nOn one dark night, and very soon, Klar, Grat, and Marsten were going to\r\ndisappear.\r\n\r\nMaybe I was the greatest attraction on earth. But Norbert Marsten was\r\ngoing to be the greatest attraction on Mars.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\nJoe had quite a day for himself Thursday and as usual I had to tag\r\nalong. If I had a right arm to give I\'d give it for a day off now and\r\nthen. Like on Thursday. On Thursday he really outdid himself.\r\n\r\nHe woke up in the hotel room and had a shower. He wasn\'t going to shave\r\nuntil I told him he looked like a bum. So he shaved and then he stood\r\nfor a whole minute admiring his beauty in the mirror, forgetting whose\r\nidea it was in the first place.\r\n\r\nSo down to the coffee shop for breakfast. A hard-working man needs a\r\ngood breakfast. So getting ready for a backbreaking day of copying\r\nreferences at the library, he had tomato juice, two fried eggs, three\r\nsausages, a sugared doughnut and coffee--with cream and sugar.\r\n\r\nHe couldn\'t work that off his pot in a week of ditch-digging under\r\na July sun, but a hard-working man needs a good breakfast. I was\r\ntoo disgusted to argue with him. He\'s hopeless when he smells that\r\nshort-order smell of smoking grease, frying bacon and coffee.\r\n\r\nHe wanted to take a taxi to the library--eight blocks!\r\n\r\n"Walk, you jerk!" I told him. He started to mumble about pulling down\r\nsix hundred bucks for this week\'s work and then he must have thought\r\nI was going to mention the high-calorie breakfast. To him that\'s\r\nhitting below the belt. 

He thinks he\'s an unfortunate man with an\r\naffliction--about twenty pounds of it. He walked and arrived at the\r\nlibrary glowing with virtue.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMaking out his slip at the newspaper room he blandly put down next to\r\n_firm_--_The Griffin Press, Inc._--when he knew as well as I did that\r\nhe was a free lance and hadn\'t even got a definite assignment from\r\nGriffin.\r\n\r\nThere\'s a line on the slip where you put down _reason for consulting\r\nfiles (please be specific)_. It\'s a shame to cramp Joe\'s style to\r\njust one line after you pitch him an essay-type question like that.\r\nHe squeezed in, _Preparation of article on year in biochemistry for\r\nGriffin Pr. Encyc. 1952 Yrbk._, and handed it with a flourish to the\r\nlibrarian.\r\n\r\nThe librarian, a nice old man, was polite to him, which is usually\r\na mistake with Joe. After he finished telling the librarian how his\r\nmicrofilm files ought to be organized and how they ought to switch from\r\nmicrofilm to microcard and how in spite of everything the New York\r\nPublic Library wasn\'t such a bad place to research, he got down to work.\r\n\r\nHe\'s pretty harmless when he\'s working--it\'s one of the things that\r\nkeeps me from cutting his throat. With a noon break for apple pie and\r\ncoffee he transcribed about a hundred entries onto his cards, mopping\r\nup the year in biochemistry nicely. He swaggered down the library\r\nsteps, feeling like Herman Melville after finishing Moby Dick.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be so smug," I told him. "You still have to write the piece. 

And\r\nthey still have to buy it."\r\n\r\n"A detail," he said grandly. "Just journalism. I can do it with my eyes\r\nshut."\r\n\r\nJust journalism. Somehow his three months of running copy for the A.P.\r\nbefore the war has made him an Ed Leahy.\r\n\r\n"_When_ are you going to do it with your eyes...?" I began but it\r\nwasn\'t any use. He began telling me about how Gautama Buddha didn\'t\r\nbreak with the world until he was 29 and Mohammed didn\'t announce that\r\nhe was a prophet until he was 30, so why couldn\'t _he_ one of these\r\ndays suddenly bust loose with a new revelation or something and set the\r\nworld on its ear? What it boiled down to was he didn\'t think he\'d write\r\nthe article tonight.\r\n\r\nHe postponed his break with the world long enough to have a ham and\r\ncheese on rye and more coffee at an automat and then phoned Maggie. She\r\nwas available as usual. 

She said as usual, "Well then, why don\'t you\r\njust drop by and we\'ll spend a quiet evening with some records?"\r\n\r\nAs usual he thought that would be fine since he was so beat after a\r\nhard day. As usual I told him, "You\'re a louse, Joe. You know all she\r\nwants is a husband and you know it isn\'t going to be you, so why don\'t\r\nyou let go of the girl so she can find somebody who means business?"\r\n\r\nThe usual answers rolled out automatically and we got that out of the\r\nway.\r\n\r\nMaybe Maggie isn\'t very bright but she seemed glad to see him. She\'s\r\nshooting for her Doctorate in sociology at N.Y.U., she does part-time\r\ncase work for the city, she has one of those three-room Greenwich\r\nVillage apartments with dyed burlap drapes and studio couches and\r\nhome-made mobiles. She thinks writing is something holy and Joe\'s\r\ncareful not to tell her different.\r\n\r\nThey drank some rhine wine and seltzer while Joe talked about the\r\nday\'s work as though he\'d won the Nobel prize for biochemistry. He got\r\ndownright brutal about Maggie being mixed up in such an approximate\r\nunquantitative excuse for a science as sociology and she apologized\r\nhumbly and eventually he forgave her. Big-hearted Joe.\r\n\r\nBut he wasn\'t so fried that he _had_ to start talking about a man\r\nwanting to settle down--"not this year but maybe next. Thirty\'s a\r\ndividing point that makes you stop and wonder what you really want and\r\nwhat you\'ve really got out of life, Maggie darlin\'." It was as good as\r\ntelling her that she should be a good girl and continue to keep open\r\nhouse for him and maybe some day ... maybe.\r\n\r\nAs I said, maybe Maggie isn\'t very bright. But as I also said,\r\nThursday was the day Joe picked to outdo himself.\r\n\r\n"Joe," she said with this look on her face, "I got a new LP of the\r\nBrahms Serenade Number One. It\'s on top of the stack. 

Would you tell me\r\nwhat you think of it?"\r\n\r\nSo he put it on and they sat sipping rhine wine and seltzer and he\r\nturned it over and they sat sipping rhine wine and seltzer until both\r\nsides were played. And she kept watching him. Not adoringly.\r\n\r\n"Well," she asked with this new look, "what did you think of it?

"\r\n\r\nHe told her, of course. There was some comment on Brahms\'\r\narchitectonics and his resurrection of the contrapuntal style. Because\r\nhe\'d sneaked a look at the record\'s envelope he was able to spend a\r\ncouple of minutes on Brahms\' debt to Haydn and the young Beethoven in\r\nthe fifth movement (_allegro_, D Major) and the gay _rondo_ of the--\r\n\r\n"Joe," she said, not looking at him. "Joe," she said, "I got that\r\nrecord at one hell of a discount down the street. It\'s a wrong\r\npressing. Somehow the first side is the first half of the Serenade but\r\nthe second half is Schumann\'s Symphonic Studies Opus Thirteen. Somebody\r\nnoticed it when they played it in a booth. 

But I guess you didn\'t\r\nnotice it."\r\n\r\n"Get out of _this one_, braino," I told him.\r\n\r\nHe got up and said in a strangled voice, "And I thought you were my\r\nfriend. I suppose I\'ll never learn." He walked out.\r\n\r\nI suppose he never will.\r\n\r\nGod help me, I ought to know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe three crew members of the Ad Astra looked at one another, grinning\r\nweakly, in the whispering silence after the motors had kicked off. This\r\nwas the culminating point of a half-century of preparation; behind them\r\nwas the satellite launching station--ahead of them, a faint red dot,\r\nwas Mars.\r\n\r\nBryan, nominal head of the expedition, touched the shutter studs that\r\nopened their windows on the universe. They stood silently, the three of\r\nthem; Bryan and Hughes looking back at the majesty of the retreating\r\nEarth--Williams, rigid with ecstasy at the forward port.\r\n\r\nThe stars were his passion and his joy. Women filled a momentary\r\nneed, men he accepted or rejected as they could help him to achieve\r\nhis goal. Now, as astrogator of the Ad Astra he had fulfilled his\r\ndream; and now before him Canopus, Rigel, Cassiopeia and Aldebaran lay\r\njewel-like on the dark velvet of space.\r\n\r\nHow stars had absorbed the thoughts of mankind since the beginning, he\r\nthought happily, and what dreams had the ancient Chaldeans known as\r\nthey mapped the routes of the galleons of space? And the poets.... "See\r\nhow the floor of Heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold--"\r\nhe quoted softly.\r\n\r\n"My, that\'s pretty," Bryan said solemnly behind him. 

"Who said that?

"\r\n\r\n"Williams did--" returned Hughes equally dead-pan.\r\n\r\nWilliams flushed under their good-natured grins. "Shakespeare said it,\r\nyou uneducated yokels," he said loftily. "How come you aren\'t cheating\r\neach other at gin rummy yet? 

Last I heard one of you owed the other a\r\nmillion dollars."\r\n\r\n"It was only six hundred thousand," Hughes grinned, "and I\'m about to\r\ntake him double or nothing!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe weeks passed slowly. 

Barely audible, the computers ticked, keeping\r\nthe ship on course. Bryan and Hughes wrangled amiably over their\r\ninterminable card-games, throwing an occasional, joking aside to\r\nWilliams watching the stars, absorbed as a miser fingering his jewels.\r\n\r\nMars, from a minute speck, grew to a planet lying bloody in the\r\ncold rays of the distant sun. Strapped down in obedience to the\r\ncomputer-given signal, the ship reversed, fired its rockets and touched\r\ndown on her supporting pillars of flame and became only a shining\r\nneedle dwarfed in the immensity of the pinkish-red desert.\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other doubtfully, conscious of anti-climax. This\r\nwas little different from the far reaches of the Gobi plateau where\r\nthey had trained for weary, boring months. Bryan and Hughes drew the\r\nlots as the two to don their heated, protective suits and explore\r\nwithin cautious distance of the ship. Williams, restless and bored,\r\nwatched their horseplay resentfully. Even the tenuous atmosphere of the\r\ndead world dimmed the splendor of the heavens; why didn\'t they hurry\r\nand get it over with? He shivered a little watching Bryan and Hughes\r\ntrudging clumsily in the sand, throwing out a comment occasionally for\r\nthe benefit of the tape recorder in the cabin.\r\n\r\n"This is different from the deserts back home," Hughes said. "Back\r\nthere you get the feeling they\'re just waiting for somebody to move in,\r\nbut here...."\r\n\r\n"It\'s more like a haunted house," Bryan finished for him. Williams,\r\nadjusting his headphones, was conscious of a deepening of his faint\r\nuneasiness--why didn\'t they hurry up and get back! All they really had\r\nto do was build a cairn and plant the Federation flag. They had found a\r\nfew rocks and Bryan was stooping to bury the prepared canister with the\r\ndata of the flight--\r\n\r\nWilliams watching incredulously as Bryan and Hughes reeled and\r\nstaggered, was dimly conscious of a sudden faint tremor along the ship.\r\nThere was an abrupt metallic shrieking in his headset, a background of\r\nthundering, grinding bedlam, and over it Bryan\'s voice frantic--\r\n\r\n"Cave-in! Lift ship--_lift ship_!"\r\n\r\nIt had been the one constant in the shifting, nebulous mass of theory\r\ndrilled into them. _They_ were valuable--the _ship_ was irreplaceable.\r\nWith a last unbelieving look of horror at the gigantic crack widening\r\nunder the very feet of his companions, Williams threw himself into\r\nthe control seat and threw the lever over to "takeoff" position. The\r\nrockets fired and the ship rose majestically, the thousand foot fiery\r\nsplendor of her trail blotting out the space-suited figures toppling\r\ninto the thundering chasm.\r\n\r\nHours later, Williams pulled himself up, looking around dazedly. The\r\nmotors had shut off and the great ship was coasting noiselessly along\r\nthe return track; only the computers ticked steadily and the air-valves\r\nmade a muted shushing in the silence. Funny he hadn\'t noticed the\r\nsilence on the way out--sometimes he had even been irritated with the\r\nnoise Bryan and Hughes had made with their eternal wrangling over their\r\ncards. Automatically he pushed the forward viewing plate button feeling\r\nthe familiar sense of timeless peace as he looked out on the eternal\r\nsuns.\r\n\r\nMechanically he ate and slept in the days that followed, dimly aware\r\nof a giggling, wild-eyed stranger in some remote corner of his mind,\r\nwaiting to overtake him if he showed awareness of his presence. He\r\npushed away too, the thought of Bryan and Hughes, forgetting in the\r\nsameness of his days that he had ever been anything but alone. At first\r\nhe had cried a little in his lonesomeness, but as the weeks went on\r\nhe remembered only that once there had been others who had deserted\r\nhim. He nodded familiarly to the stars, smiling a little; there was\r\nonly himself and them, shining steadfastly above him. They would never\r\nchange--never desert him!\r\n\r\nTime went by unnoticed. 

The green dot of Earth became a glowing green\r\nand blue orb, circled by a tiny white dot. The computer changed its\r\nrhythm--above the control board the "strap-in" warning flashed unseen\r\nas the rockets fired swinging the ship into the turnover, ready for\r\norbit with the satellite ferry station. Williams gazing with dreamy\r\npleasure at the jewelled curtain above him was hurled against the port\r\nby the sudden surge of acceleration. The ship heeled over, twisted,\r\nthen turned----\r\n\r\nWilliams hung head down, screaming, as the black curtain tore, the\r\nstars falling dizzily away--_below_ him....\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _He screamed once, falling face down through the stars,\r\nthrough the gold-inlaid, dizzying, beautiful, sickening...._]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA year later, the psychiatrists, quite pleased with themselves found\r\nhim ready for duty again; not in Space of course, but the hero of the\r\nfirst Mars expedition was always sure of a job with Space Authority.\r\nNow he could even look up at the stars at night without screaming with\r\nvertigo.\r\n\r\nTonight walking confidently along the country road, fragrant and\r\ndotted with shining pools after the recent rain, he looked up thinking\r\nnostalgically, "the patines of bright gold...."\r\n\r\nA coldness about his feet halted him. He looked down and once again the\r\nblack curtain tore before his eyes--once more they were there, the cold\r\nunfriendly stars, swinging in the empty void--\r\n\r\nBelow him.\r\n\r\nFalling downward past the whirling suns, he screamed, hardly aware of\r\nthe choking wetness in his lungs....\r\n\r\nAbout him the inch-deep shining pool rippled for a moment and was\r\nstill, reflecting once more the floor of Heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe storm ruined my plan.\r\n\r\nNot by seasickness. I\'d come prepared for the worst, knowing how rough\r\nit could get on a sailing ship of the Nineteenth Century. I outrode the\r\nstorm easily, stowed away in the hold. Not even the breakage of some of\r\nthe 1700 barrels of alcohol carried as a cargo bothered me although the\r\nstench was terrific.\r\n\r\nBut on the morning of 25 November 1872, the first mate, Albert\r\nRichardson sent the second mate, Andrew Gilling below with two of the\r\nGerman seamen to assay the storm damage. They found me and I was hauled\r\naloft before Captain Briggs as a stowaway.\r\n\r\nCaptain Briggs of the _Mary Celeste_ eyed my strange clothing with\r\ndeep curiosity, but his interest was obviously more concerned with my\r\nunauthorized presence. He said sternly, "When did you get aboard?"\r\n\r\nI realized that I had to impress him. I smiled. "You delayed your\r\nsailing from the Fifth November to the Sixth so that you and Mrs.\r\nBriggs could have dinner aboard _Die Gratia_ with Captain\r\nMorehouse," I said.\r\n\r\n"How can you know so much?" he exclaimed. "How can you live as a\r\nstowaway for almost twenty days?"\r\n\r\nI held up my chronithon contactor, knowing that now I could impress him\r\nindeed. "Captain Briggs," I said, "I am a time-travelling historian\r\nfrom the Twenty-Second Century." I pointed to the big red button on the\r\ntop. "Until I depress this button and return to my own day and age,\r\nevery morning I receive my daily ration of food and water. It\'s about--"\r\n\r\nI\'d timed it close. I was interrupted by the click of the chronithon as\r\nit time-transferred my daily ration. I opened the cabinet and offered a\r\nbite of twenty-second century breakfast to the captain.\r\n\r\nHe said, "This is a sailor\'s tall tale, I think. You claim that you\'re\r\na time-travelling historian? Then tell me, why are you here on _Mary\r\nCeleste_?"\r\n\r\n"Captain Briggs," I said, "the Time Machine was invented in Nineteen\r\nEighty-Seven. Within twenty years every historical event had been\r\npainstakingly researched and authentically written--re-written--by\r\ntime-travelling historians who viewed the event as partaking\r\neye-witnesses. By my time, fame and fortune awaits any man who has\r\nthe luck and dogged determination to scour historic time to locate\r\nsome event that has not been recounted faithfully to the last niggling\r\nlittle detail. Why, Captain Briggs, in Jim Bishop\'s famous \'The Day\r\nColumbus Landed\' they record the name of the man who owned the hen that\r\nlaid the egg that Columbus stood on end to impress Isabella with his\r\nability. And so, Captain Briggs, I stowed away because I--"\r\n\r\nA woman\'s voice interrupted me, I turned to look at the captain\'s wife\r\nwho, of course, was the only woman aboard _Mary Celeste_. She was\r\ncarrying little Sophia Matilda in her arms. She said, "Edward, what\r\nunearthly manner of ship is that?"\r\n\r\nThe steward, Edward Head replied, "I don\'t rightly know, ma-am."\r\n\r\nI turned to look. No more than fifty feet from the starboard rail was\r\na vast barge. Upon the barge were serried rows of seats that stretched\r\nupwards and backwards for hundreds of feet. The seats were filling\r\nrapidly; ushers were escorting the spectators efficiently, vendors\r\nwere selling refreshments and programs. A thrumming sound came from\r\noverhead and I looked up to watch the materialization of jetcopters and\r\npersonnel carriers and even a poised spacecraft hanging in a dome above\r\nour heads.\r\n\r\nOver the lee rail came a crew of technicians carrying the heavy\r\nWard-Workman tridi recorders of the twenty-seventh century, and their\r\ndirector pulled a script from his pocket and said:\r\n\r\n"Joe, you and Pete dislocate the binnacle and break the compass. Al,\r\nopen the fore hatch and lazarette. Tony, that spring-wound chronometer\r\nis a pre-atomic clock and worth a fortune to the National Museum,\r\nput it among my personal loot, along with the sextant. You can keep\r\nthe ship\'s register, but give the navigation books to George with my\r\ncompliments. 

Let\'s see, um. 

Sails, jib and fore-topmast. Now toss\r\nthe yawl overboard; get it out of the way. It\'s missing." 

One of his\r\nmen came up and said something to him that I could not hear. "No,"\r\nhe replied, "It would not be more dramatic to dummy-up a half-eaten\r\nbreakfast and a pan of milk warming on the stove for the baby. Too\r\nmany writers tried to make it that way in the beginning. 

I know what\'s\r\nauthentic."\r\n\r\nThen he paused as the Ward-Workman cameramen panned around _Mary\r\nCeleste_ making close-up and approach shots. One by one they\r\nfinished their work and reported to him.\r\n\r\n"Fine," he said, looking at his strapwatch. "Now let\'s back off for\r\nsome long shots. 

And remember, we don\'t know what kind of a catastrophe\r\nthis is going to be, so keep those tridi recorders running constantly\r\nuntil I tell you to stop!"\r\n\r\nCaptain Benjamin Spooner Briggs of _Mary Celeste_ put an arm\r\naround his wife. To me he said, "I don\'t completely understand, but I\r\ndo get enough to realize that we\'re the subject of something evil."\r\n\r\n"Yes," I replied, "you--"\r\n\r\n"We\'re not waiting here to let it happen to us!" he snapped.\r\n\r\n"But you can\'t change history!" 

I objected.\r\n\r\n"Watch," he said roughly. And then with a stentorian voice, Captain\r\nBriggs roared: "_Abandon ship!_"\r\n\r\nThe captain and his wife, still carrying their daughter Sophia Matilda,\r\nmingled with the photorecording crew. The two mates, the steward,\r\nand the four German seamen went over the side and swam swiftly for\r\nthe barges. There were flurries of activity when they went aboard\r\nthe barges, but then the activity stilled and I was alone on _Mary\r\nCeleste_.\r\n\r\nI looked around me and realized that Captain Briggs hadn\'t changed\r\nhistory. He\'d made it!\r\n\r\nSlowly the barges emptied, the spectators returned to their own time\r\nand place among the Centuries. Sorrowfully I pressed my button and went\r\nhome. My fame would never be, my fortune would never start. My book\r\nwould remain unwritten, for I knew full well that potential customer\r\nfor this historic event had been here as an eye-witness. After seeing\r\nit, who\'d bother to buy my book?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn 4 December, 1872, Captain Morehouse of _Die Gratia_ sighted\r\n_Mary Celeste_ yawing in a mild sea with jib and fore-topmast\r\nsails set, no one at the helm and no one aboard. The binnacle was\r\nknocked out of place, the compass was broken. The sextant, the\r\nchronometer, ship\'s register and navigation books were missing. The\r\nship\'s yawl, lashed to the main hatch was missing. The fore hatch\r\nand lazarette were open and about a dozen of the ship\'s cargo of 1701\r\nbarrels of alcohol were broken or leaking badly.\r\n\r\nThe last notation in the ship\'s deck log had been made early in the\r\nmorning of 25 November 1872, and the account of the previous hours\r\nindicated that _Mary Celeste_ had come through a severe storm on\r\nthe previous day and most of the night.\r\n\r\nAccounts that include half-eaten plates of food, half-packed bags and\r\nother evidences of an abrupt interruption and panicky flight for safety\r\nare false.\r\n\r\nNo survivors have ever turned up, no explanation can be given.\r\nResearchers in the "Mystery of _Mary Celeste_" suggest that the\r\nstorm, the leaking alcohol, combined to frighten Captain Briggs with a\r\nthreat of fire or explosion and that they all took off in the ship\'s\r\nyawl, which floundered.\r\n\r\nWe will not know the truth until someone invents the Time Machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n

]\r\n\r\n\r\nWith his explanations to the reporters completed, Dr. King felt that\r\nwhen he pulled the switch he would automatically restore his good name\r\nand bring to a close a career of solid scientific achievement. Most of\r\nall, he would bring to an end the practice of referring to him as "Side\r\nEffect Charlie."\r\n\r\nDr. Charles King was willing to admit that there were excellent reasons\r\nfor his acquiring this hated nickname. The facts were that the bulk of\r\nhis scientific achievements were made inadvertently--that is to say,\r\nhis discoveries were all made through investigation of unexpected\r\nside effects of his experiments. In a career conspicuous for unusual,\r\nunanticipated side effects, two in particular stand out.\r\n\r\nThe first discovery resulted in rendering the entire heat-oriented\r\nmetallurgical industry obsolete, and founding upon its corpse a new\r\nindustry. This was based on the extracting of metal from ore and\r\nits subsequent shaping by first eliminating the bonds that hold the\r\nmolecules of metal together, and then reversing the process when the\r\ndesired shape was attained. Dr. King did not discover this process\r\ndirectly. He thought he had discovered a method of making metal\r\nsurfaces self-lubricating and 100% friction free. It was not until\r\nseveral installations utilizing his lubrication method became pools\r\nof liquid metal that Dr. King bothered to discover how his method\r\nworked, and of course the means to reverse his process. The resulting\r\nrevolution in metal-processing methods endeared him to everyone--except\r\na few vested interests like the shareholders in existing metal\r\ncompanies, who were uniformly glum.\r\n\r\nThe second discovery, although monumental in itself, is important\r\nbecause it indirectly led to the special project which Dr. King was\r\njust completing. 

Dr. King succeeded in growing some crystals in a\r\nnutrient solution. What actually happened was that while eating lunch\r\nat a lab table he managed to knock something into something else and a\r\ncrystal developed. Dr. King became fascinated with the odd structure\r\nof these crystals as revealed to him under an electron microscope. (He\r\nhad incidentally placed the crystal under the microscope in error.)\r\nAs a result, he took to investigating the properties of the crystals\r\nwhenever he could find time. Despite his well earned reputation as an\r\naccidental discoverer, it should be pointed out that Dr. King is a\r\nvery methodical man. This means he is capable of repeating the same\r\nmistake twice, or for that matter any number of times. Therefore, Dr.\r\nKing produced all the crystals he needed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was during a vacation in the Adirondacks that Dr. King discovered\r\nthe propulsive qualities of the crystals.\r\n\r\nThis discovery, of course, is what led to the perfection of the "King\r\nPropulsor Unit," the heart of our starship drive systems. Dr. King\r\nwas investigating the piezo-electric properties of the crystals in a\r\nmakeshift device of his own design when he was disturbed by a sudden\r\ndraft in the room. He looked up to discover that one wall of his\r\nworkshop and the top one thousand feet of a mile-thick mountain (the\r\nsame mountain that his cabin was located upon) were no longer in the\r\nimmediate vicinity.\r\n\r\nAs it turned out, his crude device did not impart to the mountain\r\nall of the thrust inherent in the crystal. The mountain top reached\r\nonly to the orbit of Jupiter, where it settled down to become its\r\nnewest satellite. Coincidental with Dr. King\'s experiment, intensive\r\nastronomical work was going on with Jupiter as its prime object. The\r\ncapturing of the satellite was observed and recorded independently by\r\nat least six observatories, including the one on Tycho.\r\n\r\nSubsequent investigation of the time involved to project this mass\r\ndisclosed that Dr. King had invented a faster than light drive. (It\r\nshould be pointed out that, while the discovery of the faster than\r\nlight drive made the name of Dr. King world renowned, it did not in any\r\nway endear him to the relatives of those thousand-odd persons who lived\r\nin the hamlet located on the mountain top that ended up a satellite of\r\nJupiter. They also were quite glum.

)\r\n\r\nFurther work, all of a mathematical nature, disclosed to Dr. King the\r\nproper method of enclosing these crystals in a unit to drive space\r\nships to the stars. Coincidental with his work on the propulsor units\r\nhe made a startling discovery which led to his special project.\r\n\r\nDr. King invented perpetual motion.\r\n\r\nA series of complicated equations indicated to Dr. King that if he\r\nenclosed six of the crystals in the business end of a pendulum, and\r\nstarted the pendulum oscillating, it would tick-tock for all eternity.\r\n\r\nThis discovery began a five-year program that ended with a full scale\r\npress conference. The purpose was to unveil the building designed to\r\nprotect this pendulum for all eternity, and of course to unveil the\r\ndiscovery of perpetual motion at the same time.\r\n\r\nThis building was designed to be Dr. King\'s monument to his own genius.\r\nIt was a large rambling structure in which the pendulum was displayed\r\nby viewing it through a large hole in a brick wall. All of Dr. King\'s\r\nconsiderable savings had gone into designing a computer, the heart\r\nof his protective system. The computer was programmed to protect the\r\nticking of the pendulum under every conceivable circumstance. So\r\nthorough was this programming that special devices were installed to\r\nkeep the building and its precious cargo moving in earth\'s projected\r\norbit if, through some gigantic mishap, the earth was reduced to cosmic\r\ndust. The switch that would impart the initial pulse to the pendulum\r\nwould also start the computer operating, rendering the entire structure\r\ntotally inviolable.\r\n\r\nWith a flourish, Dr. King pulled the switch.\r\n\r\nNothing happened.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was an embarrassed shuffling of feet by the reporters. Then, as\r\nDr. King became more exasperated, the reporters became amused. 

The\r\namusement turned to open laughter when Dr. King, frantic with fear,\r\nrushed to the door to check the wiring on the inside of the building.\r\n\r\nThe door would not open. The computer was at work guarding a\r\nnonfunctioning machine.\r\n\r\nHe rushed to the open hole in the wall, intending to provide the\r\ninitial pulse necessary to start the pendulum swinging by pushing.\r\nHe found that the computer had designed a force field to keep him\r\nfrom entering. Frustrated and at his wit\'s end, he flew into a rage\r\nwhich ended in a fatal heart attack when he heard one reporter\r\nlaughingly say to him: "Don\'t let it get you down, Doctor. 

You\'ve\r\nbeat the jinx. In one step you\'ve gone from \'Side-Effect-Charlie\' to\r\n\'No-Effect-Charlie.\'"\r\n\r\nIt would be comforting to be able to assure everyone that the reporter\r\nin question was correct. Unfortunately Dr. King\'s monument did work,\r\nand probably will work for all eternity. 

The day after Dr. Charles\r\nKing had his unfortunate heart attack a homesick astronomer on Sirius\r\nreported to his superior, and subsequently to the entire populated\r\nuniverse, that when he turned his telescope on the Solar System he\r\ndiscovered that it had acquired a new motion.\r\n\r\nThe entire system swung back and forth like a pendulum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


Thinking back on it, the whole morning had been like\r\nthat. Nervous and excited.\r\n\r\nRight after breakfast, Max had given me a good bath and loaded me in\r\nthe car. I always like to ride in the car and this time Max even\r\nallowed me to stick my head out the window. He doesn\'t usually let me\r\ndo that, but I was too engrossed in the exhilarating rush of air to\r\npay any attention to the change of routine. When we drew up in front\r\nof a large brick building a multitude of strange and peculiar odors\r\nassailed my nose, tantalizingly anonymous. Max\'s big hand caught me\r\nbefore I got halfway through the window. 

That disgusted me, because I\r\nwanted to investigate the funny smells, and I pouted all the way into\r\nthe building. As the events of the next hour progressed I got madder\r\nand madder.\r\n\r\nFirst there was the doctor, poking around in my mouth, stabbing my\r\neyes with a blinding beam of light, and prodding and squeezing my\r\nbody. It reminded me of the day I came to live with Max and I was\r\ntempted to take a hunk out of this doctor\'s hand like I did the other\r\none. 

But Max was there and that stopped me. I didn\'t want to see the\r\nhurt look that would come to his eyes every time I did something\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\nAfter the doctor finished Max led me into a gleaming white room where\r\nI was surrounded by a gushing mob of women dressed in white uniforms.\r\nTheir "Ohs!" and "Ahs!" 

and "Isn\'t he beautiful!"--I\'m not beautiful\r\nand I detest the description--put the finishing touch to what had once\r\nbeen a wonderful day. I flopped to the floor, trying to ignore them.\r\nThen, indignities of indignities, one of the "girls" tried to pick up\r\nmy eighty pounds of blue-gray masculinity. That was the last straw!\r\n\r\nI let out a deep-throated growl, and sprang clear of her encircling\r\narms. Fangs bared, ears flat against my head, I must have presented a\r\nterrifying appearance to the women, because they fled to all corners\r\nof the room, squealing and bleating like a bunch of sheep.\r\n\r\nFor the fun of it, I made a short dash at the one who had tried to\r\npick me up. With a high-pitched scream she slumped to the floor in a\r\ndead faint. I could hardly keep from laughing as I turned to search\r\nfor a new victim. About this time Max came barging through the door\r\nand grabbed me by the scruff of the neck, putting an end to my fun. He\r\nwasn\'t mad, although he pretended to be, and I could detect the humor\r\nin his voice while he scolded me.\r\n\r\nBack in the car again, Max roared with laughter while patting me on\r\nthe head and saying, "You old devil, you!" in that special way he has\r\nwhen amused at something I\'ve done. When he finally got control of\r\nhimself, he started the car and drove in the direction of the funny\r\nsmells. As the smells got stronger, I began to get uneasy. Looking at\r\nMax, I sensed that he was uneasy too. "What was going on?" I wondered\r\nas the car dipped down a ramp and entered a dimly lit cave where the\r\nsmells became overpowering.\r\n\r\nThe cave was jammed with huge tank-trucks and that was where the\r\nstrange smells were coming from. I don\'t know what was in the trucks,\r\nbut Max said something about nitric acid and hydrozine fuel when he\r\nnoticed my interest in them. Leaving the car, we walked down a short\r\npassage branching off the cave, climbed a couple flights of stairs and\r\nemerged in the bright sunlight. I nearly yipped in surprise as I\r\ncaught sight of the over-grown thing beside me. It looked for all the\r\nworld like a giant cigar that had been cut in half and stood on end.\r\nThere were still three or four trucks around the base of the thing and\r\na kind of fear spread through my mind. The magic of the strange smells\r\nwas gone and here, at close quarters, the smell was raw and\r\nuninviting.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMax led me to a group of men and they talked for a few minutes. I\r\ndidn\'t pay much attention to what they said until one of them, a big\r\nman with a lot of stars on his shoulder, reached down and patted my\r\nback. "Better get him loaded," said the Starman. "Only ten minutes\r\ntill blast-off."\r\n\r\nMax led me to a kind of open-air elevator and started up the side of\r\nthe gleaming monster. At the top Max put me into a padded cage inside\r\nthe cigar, fastened the straps, and patted me. Then he was gone and a\r\nlarge door slid into place, leaving me in vile smelling, pitch\r\ndarkness. I lay there quietly, but the uneasy feeling kept getting\r\nworse. A sudden hissing noise nearly scared me to death; then I\r\nremembered my training. The hissing was only air, the same as had been\r\nin the cage at home, and wouldn\'t hurt me. Even so, I struggled\r\nagainst the straps, trying to reach them with my teeth. Nothing doing\r\nand again I lay quiet--waiting.\r\n\r\nI must have dozed off because the next thing I knew my cage was\r\ntrembling violently and a powerful roaring dinned in my ears. This\r\nlasted only a second, then something crushed my body flat in the cage.\r\nMy legs grew heavy and a racking, tearing pain ripped at my muscles. A\r\nblack film blotted out the lighter blackness of my cage.\r\n\r\nI don\'t know what happened in the interval, but when I came to the\r\nroar was gone and my body felt like it was floating in the air. My\r\nhead felt swollen and I experienced some difficulty in swallowing. I\r\ncouldn\'t hear a thing except the hiss of air and I was suddenly\r\novercome by the feeling that I was a long way from home.\r\n\r\nSlowly I became aware that my body was regaining its weight. The cage\r\nwas becoming quite warm now and I licked my nose, wishing for a cold\r\ndrink of water. Suddenly I was jerked against the straps and I forgot\r\nall about my other troubles. The jerks didn\'t hurt me as much as they\r\nscared me. I had experienced somewhat the same thing when Max hit the\r\ncar brakes hard, but he wasn\'t here to pat me reassuringly.\r\n\r\nThe cage was getting real hot now and the jerks were coming with\r\nincreasing frequency. The air had stopped too and I desperately wanted\r\na drink. The last thing I remember before the crash was wishing that\r\nMax would open the door and let me out like he always had at home.\r\n\r\nMax\'s gentle voice sounded a long way off. "Good boy!" 

he kept\r\nrepeating. 

"Good boy!" I couldn\'t find the strength to open my eyes so\r\nI just lay quietly and listened to the talk, thankful that the smell,\r\nthat had penetrated the entire day, was gone now.\r\n\r\n"I was afraid that those parachutes wouldn\'t cut the speed enough to\r\nget him down alive," said the Starman who had patted my back earlier.\r\n\r\n"No sign of radiation," said a strange voice. "His blood count is\r\nnormal and he isn\'t hurt physically unless there are internal\r\ninjuries.

"\r\n\r\n"What about his weakness?" asked Max, patting me.\r\n\r\n"You\'d be weak too, if you had been through the ordeal he has," said\r\nStrange-voice. "He\'ll get over that soon and live to father a good\r\nmany space-puppies."\r\n\r\nStrange-voice was absolutely right in his forecast and it\'s with\r\npardonable fatherly pride that I lead each new family to the great\r\nstone monument which reads: "_In honor of Rex, a German Shepherd dog,\r\nwho pioneered man\'s first flight into outer space._"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n


]\r\n\r\n\r\nRight then he was the scaredest he\'d ever been in his life. Yet even as\r\nhe watched the spaceship turning within the glow of its flaring jets,\r\nhe kept thinking of his father\'s warning:\r\n\r\n"A boy\'s duty, son, is to keep his eyes and ears open and to give the\r\nalarm. We must be alerted ... or we\'re doomed."\r\n\r\nIt had been drummed into him ever since the landing and explosion of\r\nthe rockets. He\'d been very little then and it was hard to understand.\r\nBut they\'d explained it carefully--over and over again.\r\n\r\nThe rockets were a test. They\'d been fired by beings on another planet.\r\nSome day the beings themselves would come to invade.\r\n\r\nHe\'d often thought about it--especially at night in bed. 

And he\'d\r\ndreamed about it, too. Horrible dreams. And now the dreams had come\r\ntrue!\r\n\r\nTrembling, he watched the silver hulk aim its jets at the ground and\r\nbegin to come down. It slipped past him with a roar. 

Its fires reddened\r\nthe hillside. It settled with a jarring thud. Then all was silence.\r\n\r\nEdging forward, he peered down into the glen. The dust and smoke was\r\nclearing and he could see most of the ship gleaming evilly in the\r\ntwilight....\r\n\r\nOthers, he thought, must have seen or heard the landing. Soon they\'d\r\ncome to fight off the invaders. He\'d be found, quivering with fear, and\r\nbranded a coward. He must do something....\r\n\r\nA sudden metallic clanging made him jump. A light flicked on. He sucked\r\na deep breath. The beings!\r\n\r\nThey stood on a platform next to a trap-door. Three of them: squat,\r\nfat, and silvery-white ... like the insects he often found under flat\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nOne held the light. The other two carried strange looking boxes. They\r\nmade their way down a ladder and began to set up the boxes on the\r\nground. 

This was his chance, he told himself. While they were busy, he\r\ncould climb to the top of the hill and escape down the other side.\r\n\r\nBut he\'d only taken three steps when he stubbed his toe on a rock,\r\njarred it loose, and sent it pelting into the glen.\r\n\r\nThey hurried over to see what it was and he got a better look at them.\r\nTheir wrinkled skin hung from their bulgy bodies in thick folds. Insect\r\nfeelers waved over their humped backs. Flat expressionless faces\r\nglittered in the light of their lamp.... He shuddered.\r\n\r\nAfter they\'d looked at the rock, two of them started climbing in the\r\ndirection from which it had rolled. The third stayed behind, beaming\r\nthe light to guide the way.\r\n\r\nCringing against the hill, he moved along the ledge to a point where it\r\ncurled past a jutting crag. On the other side of that he\'d be hidden\r\nfrom view and could make a run for it.\r\n\r\nBut as soon as he\'d made it, he gasped, horror-stricken.... The vague\r\nshadow of the ledge pinched inward till it became the gulfing black of\r\na sheer cliff. He was trapped!\r\n\r\nHis only hope now was the coming of the town people and he listened\r\nfor noises of their approach. But all he heard was the scuffle of two\r\nbeings cresting the ledge.\r\n\r\nWas it possible that he alone knew of the landing? The town people\r\nshould have come by now.\r\n\r\nAs it was, a lot of lives depended on him. His father and mother, the\r\nother kids, and all the people, too. He couldn\'t let them down!\r\n\r\nThe beam of light, moving along the ledge ahead of the two beings, now\r\ntouched the crag and spilled over to where he stood. Then, almost as\r\nif Fate had taken charge again, his eyes were drawn to the gleam of a\r\nsharp-edged rock....\r\n\r\nHe was gripping it, poised to strike, when the first of the beings came\r\naround the bend.\r\n\r\nTwo things made him hesitate. First, size. The being was tiny--fully a\r\nthird shorter than himself.\r\n\r\nNext, the way the being acted. It had stopped and raised its hand, palm\r\nout, as if trying to make friends.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt must be a trick, he told himself. Never had he heard the beings\r\nspoken of as friends--only as vicious destroyers. He took a tighter\r\ngrip on the rock.\r\n\r\nNow he noticed something that filled him with a new loathing. 

He\'d been\r\nwrong about their appearance. The sagging skin was really a bulky suit.\r\nThe big head a helmet. And back of the helmet\'s face he could see the\r\nactual being. He felt like vomiting.\r\n\r\nHe bashed the rock against the faceplate. It webbed with a cluster of\r\ntiny cracks. He struck again and again, until the helmet split open and\r\nhe was pulping the face itself to a reddish smear....\r\n\r\nSuddenly a roaring filled his ears. His side was laced with terrible\r\npain. 

He reeled backward. Saw the second of the beings pointing at him\r\nwith something long and rodlike. He flipped the rock.\r\n\r\nIt caught the being in the chest and drove it over the side. He could\r\nsee it clawing the air all the way down to the glen.\r\n\r\nThere, the third being, with the light, took one look at the still\r\nform, turned and raced madly for the ship.\r\n\r\nWatching, he was overcome with a peculiar feeling of excitement. The\r\npain in his side had ebbed and he felt hot and feverish. 

He wanted to\r\ndo something--to act. Without thinking, he scurried down the hill and\r\ntook after the fleeing figure.\r\n\r\nHe caught it on the ladder, just below the trap-door, grabbed its leg,\r\nand jerked. It plunged to the ground and hit with a crash. The light\r\nblinked out.\r\n\r\nNow he heard a thin grating noise. Above him the trap-door, dimly\r\noutlined by a light from a cubbyhole beyond, had begun to move. He\r\nswung himself to the platform, dove into the cubbyhole, and heard the\r\ntrap clang shut behind him.\r\n\r\nStraight ahead was a short length of ladder and overhanging it a second\r\ntrap-door which had already begun to gape open. This, he guessed, was\r\nsome sort of air-lock--a way of getting in and out of the ship without\r\nlosing the built up pressure. It would account for the suits worn on\r\nthe outside.\r\n\r\nThe trap had swung wider and he could see two beings in suits getting\r\nready to come down. They probably were trying to help their buddies.\r\n\r\nHe got the first one as it started down the ladder with its back to\r\nhim. He just threw an arm around its helmet and pulled until he heard a\r\nsnap.\r\n\r\nThen he went up the ladder to get at the second one. He hit it, watched\r\nit spin across the chamber, crunch against the bulkhead, and collapse.\r\n\r\nNow a third one darted away from a bank of levers and tried to reach\r\nthe spiral stairs, rising to the next level. It wore no suit and its\r\nthin body made him think of some horrible creeping plant. He leapt for\r\nit, clutched the skinny neck with one hand, and squeezed.\r\n\r\nHe rushed to the bank of levers, then, and pushed one after another\r\nuntil he heard the scraping of the lower trap-door and the hiss of\r\nescaping air.\r\n\r\nWhen he climbed to the upper levels, all the beings were dead except\r\ntwo. He found a short piece of metal and hit them both on the head.\r\n\r\nAnd now his side had begun to ache and he felt bruised and shaky and\r\nvery weary. He must get back to town ... tell them what he\'d done ...\r\nbring them to look....\r\n\r\nBut he should take something back with him to prove the ship was there.\r\nHe noticed a bright piece of metal sunk into the bulkhead. It was\r\ncovered with symbols ... a sort of nameplate.\r\n\r\nGrasping it with the thin, flat part of two hands, he braced himself\r\nagainst the bulkhead with his other two hands and ripped it loose.\r\n\r\nOn the way back, he memorized the shape of the symbols. He might want\r\nto draw them sometime to show off:\r\n\r\n_Taggert Steel Company, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.A._\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


It could be man\'s--\r\n\r\n\r\nPrelude To Space\r\n\r\n_By Robert W. Haseltine_\r\n\r\n\r\nI was climbing the steep side of a central Wisconsin hill, holding my\r\nbow away from my body for balance, when I first saw the stranger. He sat\r\non a stump at the crest and watched me struggle up. 

As I drew nearer I\r\npanted out a greeting and received his cheerful "Hi" in return. When I\r\nfinally reached the top, I threw myself on the ground and began catching\r\nmy breath.\r\n\r\nHe didn\'t say anything at first, just looked at the bow and the quiver\r\nof arrows on my back. Finally he said, "May I look at it?" and reached\r\nfor the bow. I handed it to him. He examined it carefully and returned\r\nit.\r\n\r\n"Beautiful workmanship. Is that all you use?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I never cared much for guns," I answered. "I\'ve always thought a bow\r\ngave the animal more of an even chance for his life."\r\n\r\nWe talked then on the various aspects of hunting and how the crisp fall\r\nair seemed to make the deer seem closer than during the heat of summer.\r\nWhile we talked I tried to place the reason he disturbed me, but I\r\ncouldn\'t seem to do it. He was dressed in an old plaid shirt and\r\ndungarees and his blond hair wasn\'t many shades removed from my own\r\nstraw thatch. But there was something odd about him that I couldn\'t\r\nquite find.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it\'s the cloth." His words surprised me. "You see, it hasn\'t\r\nbeen discovered on this planet as yet." My face must have shown\r\nastonishment because he went on in the same vein. "I admit it\'s\r\nconfusing, but it\'s also true. My clothes weren\'t made on Earth." He\r\nchuckled then, deep in his throat. "I don\'t blame you for being\r\nconfused. I know how I would feel if I met an extraterrestrial being\r\nbefore space travel was a reality."\r\n\r\nI kept staring at him. Finally I blurted out, "What in Sam Hill are you\r\ntalking about?"\r\n\r\nHe leaned forward on the stump and his face grew earnest. "You might say\r\nI\'m a poll taker. I have to decide certain things from various\r\ninterviews with individuals I meet."\r\n\r\n"What are you trying to prove?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry, but I can\'t tell you that until I\'m finished with the\r\ninterview. If I told you, your interest in the subject would tend to\r\nprejudice your answers."\r\n\r\n"Fair enough. 

What do you want to ask me?"\r\n\r\nHe pulled out a notebook and smiled. "These questions may seem a little\r\nsilly but I must have straight answers to them. 

Will you go along with\r\nme?"\r\n\r\nI nodded my head.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s see now. If you were the head of a government and wanted to\r\nascertain whether another country was ready for admission into the\r\nUnited Nations, what would you do?"\r\n\r\nI shrugged. "I suppose I would read books and magazines from the country\r\nand possibly have an interview with the heads of the government. After I\r\nhad collected my data I could then act upon it."\r\n\r\n"For the sake of argument suppose the books and other periodicals were\r\nwritten so as to be prejudicial in favor of the government, and the\r\nheads also were coloring what they said."\r\n\r\nI thought for a minute. "In that case I suppose I would secretly place\r\nsomeone inside the country to interview the people and get a first hand\r\nview of the situation. Then I would act on his data."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe nodded his head. "Yes, the people themselves and the conditions they\r\nlive in will give you the needed data." He turned a page in the book.\r\n"Now suppose that you wished to know if a certain planet was ready to\r\nenter into an organization such as the Galactic Federation, what would\r\nyou do?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose I\'d act as I did before. Place people inside the various\r\nareas of the planet to interview and observe. They would bring back the\r\ninformation needed to ascertain whether they would be an asset or a\r\ndetriment to the organization."\r\n\r\nI thought to myself that the question was a trifle silly; after all,\r\nhadn\'t science proved that life couldn\'t exist on the other planets in\r\nour system?\r\n\r\nHe relaxed after I answered and his smile was brighter than the previous\r\nones. "Right," he said. 

"Naturally we had to learn the language first,\r\nbut now a first-hand check can be made. You see, there is a civilization\r\nout there," he raised his hand and swept the sky, "and we have to check\r\nto see if this planet is ready to take its place as an adult\r\ncivilization with the rest of us.\r\n\r\n"Earth, within a very short time, will be reaching her fingers into\r\nspace. Once she gets there she will be eligible to join the Galactic\r\nFederation."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all right," I said, "then we can exchange culture and knowledge\r\nwith other civilizations."\r\n\r\n"Yes, if you are eligible to join."\r\n\r\n"But you said that once we reach space we will be eligible."\r\n\r\n"Look at it this way," he said. "The main purpose of the Galactic\r\nFederation is to promote peace and understanding among the various\r\nplanets. Earth would have to be prepared to take its place as just\r\nanother member, and not an important member at that. Earth, you see, is\r\none of the smaller planets and also would be the latest one to join.\r\n\r\n"In times past some planets have reached space without being fully\r\nprepared for what they would find. They still had internal troubles on\r\ntheir own worlds. We had to place them in quarantine until they reached\r\nthat degree of civilization where they were ready to live in peace. Now\r\nwe check a planet before it reaches the space-travel stage. We find out\r\nthe reactions of the inhabitants to certain situations.

"\r\n\r\n"What sort of situations?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Well, naturally we want to see their artifacts as an indication as to\r\ntheir advancement. We have to know what the average man thinks of space\r\ntravel and trade with other planets. And their ideas on peace and their\r\nfeelings towards their fellow men. All are very important.\r\n\r\n"Actually, when a planet once enters the Federation the people are the\r\nones to decide on peace and war. So if the majority of the people on a\r\nplanet are peace-loving that planet is ready to enter the Federation."\r\n\r\n"But how do you find out all these things?" 

I asked. "When a man finds\r\nout what you are trying to prove he may lie because he wants to get into\r\nspace."\r\n\r\nHis eyes held a mischievous glint as he answered. "Simple, the art of\r\ntelepathy has been highly developed among my race. I have your thoughts\r\non everything I\'ve mentioned. Later, when all the data from thousands of\r\nsimilar interviews is in it will be evaluated and the decision made as\r\nto whether your world will be allowed to reach space. We have the means\r\nof keeping you from it if we decide you aren\'t yet ready.

"\r\n\r\nHe stood up and I followed suit. 

"I must be going now," he sighed. "This\r\nwork keeps me on the run and I have many more interviews to make.\r\nBelieve me, it was a pleasure meeting you. I hope we meet again--later."\r\nWe shook hands and he strolled over the hill into the valley.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I should have followed him, but it wouldn\'t have done any good,\r\nreally. Because a few moments later I saw something shimmering over the\r\ntop of the hill. It was big and disc-shaped and shot into the sky with a\r\nspeed that was unbelievable.\r\n\r\nI still don\'t know what to think about him or what we talked about. I\'m\r\ngoing to keep watching the papers though, and hoping he got the right\r\nanswers. If we reach the Moon I\'ll know he did....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Imagination_ May 1954.

Doris and Sue stayed out of\r\nthe argument at first.\r\n\r\nPolly defended, "Sure, it\'s a little stronger, but men like it strong.\r\nYou might as well get used to it."\r\n\r\nJune said, "See here, he\'s got to make some concessions. After all, why\r\nshould four of us suffer--"\r\n\r\n"Suffer? You call being married to Hollis Jamison suffering?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be so impressed. He\'s not doing badly marrying us, either. He\r\ncould do a lot worse."\r\n\r\n"Why, you vain witch! Just because you play a fair game of chess--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m not taking all the credit. You\'re a fine cook, Doris is witty\r\nand Sue\'s body would make any man\'s mouth water--but that\'s just the\r\npoint! Look what he\'s getting! Why should we have to change all our\r\nhabits and tastes to conform with his?"\r\n\r\nNow Doris entered the argument. "You know darn well why! It\'s still\r\na man\'s world and a man\'s choice. Back when there was a man for\r\npractically every woman, it was different. But it\'s five women to one\r\nman right now--don\'t ever forget that--five to one, and so far the law\r\nonly requires a quadracell. Just be grateful you aren\'t the one who\'s\r\nleft out. 

You and your chess-playing! How far would you get attracting\r\na man, all by yourself?"\r\n\r\n"Shhh, now, all of you," Sue broke into the telepathic conversation.\r\n"Let\'s clear the dishes and get the apartment straightened up. Hollis\r\ndid make one concession--moving in with us, instead of making us live\r\nin that dismal bachelor\'s hole of his. Let\'s not make him regret it.

"\r\n\r\nThey heeded Sue and got busy. Sue was the arbiter. She ruled the\r\nquartet with a gentle but confident mind. All four knew that her lithe,\r\nathletic body with its soft curves and golden hair was the greatest\r\nasset in this transaction of matrimony.\r\n\r\nThere had been no dissension on this point, nor could there have been.\r\nThe bureau would never have allowed them to be together and form a\r\nmarriage cell had there been the slightest dispute.\r\n\r\nMany differences of opinion were allowable, but the four had been\r\ncarefully screened in certain matters of basic tastes. They liked the\r\nsame colors, foods, styles of clothing, video programs, sports and\r\nvacation activities. All were carefully schooled ambiverts of roughly\r\nequal education. Instead of conflicting, their differences of skills,\r\ntalents and personality traits complemented each other.\r\n\r\nEven with all this care in selecting and matching, however, the big\r\ntest was the culmination of the marriage, itself--the whole purpose of\r\nthis banding together. The unpredictable quality of the most stable\r\nfeminine emotions made the choice of a mate most difficult of all.\r\n\r\nThis awareness was in all their minds this day, and it made them a\r\nlittle nervous. Even the argument that had started over the coffee had\r\nbeen faintly alarming to Sue. They were a team, welded together by the\r\nwonderful gift of telepathy, which was only possible through formation\r\nof a marriage cell. The most complete intimacy of thought and feeling\r\nhad been nurtured for a whole year before marriage was permissible.\r\nSympathy, tolerance and sharing a common experience with mutual\r\nenjoyment and happiness was the keystone of the polygamous unions.\r\nNothing must spoil it now.\r\n\r\nThe delivery vault thumped, and the signal light flicked on. Sue rushed\r\nto slide up the door.\r\n\r\n"Orchids!" they chorused mentally, and Sue noticed with satisfaction\r\nthat June\'s thought was as strong as the others. The lovely flowers\r\nwere put in the cooler, the apartment was tidied and they turned to the\r\nexciting task of becoming beautiful for their handsome husband.\r\n\r\nThe tiff over the coffee was forgotten as they became immersed in\r\nsprays, powders, tints, cosmetics, body ornaments and the precious\r\nnuptial perfume. This latter, issued to them only yesterday when they\r\nsigned the register and received the license, was now as traditionally\r\nexclusive to weddings as trousseaus had been centuries ago.\r\n\r\nFeminine clothing, of course, had long since been eliminated from the\r\noccasion, along with other redundancies such as waggish and mischievous\r\nguests, old shoes, rice and hectic honeymoon trips.\r\n\r\nThe official and religious arrangements had been completed yesterday at\r\nthe registry and the chapel, the union to become legal and effective\r\nat noon on this day. When Hollis Jamison walked through their door at\r\ntwelve o\'clock he would bring four gold rings, and the moment the rings\r\nwere placed on the proper fingers the ceremony was complete.\r\n\r\nDoris said, "Let\'s steal just a tiny whiff of the perfume. I\'m too\r\ncurious to wait.

"\r\n\r\nJune and Polly were game, but Sue cut them off. "Not on your life! I\r\nused to know a chemist at the hormone labs where they compound this\r\nstuff, and he told me about it. We have things to do, and if what he\r\ntold me is true--well, it\'s very distracting.

"\r\n\r\nPolly backed her up, "I hear it is terribly volatile. I guess we\r\nwouldn\'t want it to wear off before Hollis came."\r\n\r\n"Hollis!" The thought was June\'s, and it came thin and quavery.\r\n"What--do you suppose it\'s like to be married?"\r\n\r\nNo one answered, for there was no experience among them. Each had\r\nher own romantic idea, so cherished, so private that even within the\r\nintimacy of their clique it was too sacred to discuss.\r\n\r\nSuddenly June said, "I\'m scared."\r\n\r\nThe thought had come sharply and unexpectedly. It was contagious. Polly\r\nsaid, "Me, too.

"\r\n\r\n"Of what?" Doris asked, "Of drinking strong coffee the rest of your\r\nlives?"\r\n\r\nIt was a weak, nervous stab at humor, and Sue knew that Doris was as\r\njumpy as the rest of them. "Steady, gals," she said sympathetically.\r\n"It\'ll be worth it. We want a baby, don\'t we?"\r\n\r\nIt was the right thought at the right time. Sue felt their minds relax,\r\nand the thought even did her some good. A sweet, little, round, pink\r\nbaby--\r\n\r\nShe let the mental picture flow out to the others, and the little\r\ncrisis passed.\r\n\r\nThe minutes flew, and soon it was five minutes to twelve. "Have we\r\nforgotten anything?" Sue asked.\r\n\r\n"The perfume!" Polly and June said together.\r\n\r\n"Hurry!" Doris said. 

"I think he\'s coming."\r\n\r\nThe seal on the tiny vial was broken, one drop on each breast, and the\r\nrich, exotic fumes exuded a gentle, warm excitement that was entirely\r\ndifferent from the innocent scents they had known.\r\n\r\nThe door was unlocked, and now it opened.\r\n\r\nHollis stepped in, bronzed body bared to the waist.\r\n\r\n"The flowers!" Polly wailed inwardly. "We forgot the orchids--"\r\n\r\nBut Hollis Jamison didn\'t notice the discrepancy. He advanced smiling\r\nfrom his gray eyes and strong mouth. 

Sue opened her lips and her fine,\r\nwhite teeth showed a welcoming smile. She was proud of her lovely body,\r\nand June, Polly and Doris shared in that pride.\r\n\r\nSue held out her left hand with fingers outstretched. Her man came\r\nforward jingling the four rings in his right hand. He paused before\r\nher, drew her left hand to his lips, kissed the little finger and slid\r\nthe proper ring on it, then, in order he kissed Sue\'s other three\r\nfingers and banded them with the remaining rings, symbolic of the four\r\nseparate feminine entities who dwelt in this one magnificent body.\r\n\r\nAnd with each ring he said a name: "June, Polly, Doris, Sue--"\r\n\r\nHe straightened and gazed into the two blue eyes.\r\n\r\n"I thee wed," he said simply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


He had a reflective air and a well-trimmed goatee.\r\nHe hummed a few bars of--"It Ain\'t Whatcha Do, It\'s The Way Thatcha\r\nDo It." He broke off and looked up with a kindly smile as the nurse\r\nentered. Her name was Mudde._\r\n\r\nNURSE MUDDE. Doctor, there is a man in the waiting room who says he\r\nmade the world.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Oh?\r\n\r\nNURSE MUDDE. Shall I let him in?\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. By all means, Nurse Mudde. Show the man in.\r\n\r\n_Nurse Mudde left. A small man entered. He was five foot five wearing a\r\nsuit made for a man six foot five. His hands were near-hidden by the\r\nsleeve ends, his trouser leg bottoms creased sharply at the shoe tops,\r\nassuming the function of unattached spats. The shoes were virtually\r\ninvisible. As was the gentleman\'s mouth lurking behind a mustache of\r\nmouselike proportions._\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Won\'t you have a seat Mr....\r\n\r\nSMITH. Smith. (_He sits_)\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Now.\r\n\r\n(_They regard each other_)\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. My nurse tells me you made the world.\r\n\r\nSMITH. Yes. (_In a confessional tone_) I did.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. (_Settling back in his chair_) All of it?\r\n\r\nSMITH. Yes.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. And everything in it?\r\n\r\nSMITH. Take a little, give a little.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. You\'re sure of this?\r\n\r\nSMITH. (_With an expression that clearly says--I am telling the truth\r\nthe whole truth and nothing but the truth so help me._) Quite sure.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. (_Nods once_) When did you do this thing?\r\n\r\nSMITH. Five years ago.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. How old are you?\r\n\r\nSMITH. Forty-seven.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Where were you the other forty-two years?\r\n\r\nSMITH. I wasn\'t.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. You mean you started out....\r\n\r\nSMITH. Forty-two years old. That\'s correct.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. But the world is millions of years old.\r\n\r\nSMITH. (_Shaking his head_) No. It isn\'t.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. It\'s five years old.\r\n\r\nSMITH. That\'s correct.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. What about fossils? What about the age of rocks? Uranium into\r\nlead. 

What about diamonds?\r\n\r\nSMITH. (_Not to be bothered_) Illusions.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. You made them up.\r\n\r\nSMITH. That\'s....\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. (_Breaking in_) Why?\r\n\r\nSMITH. To see if I could.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. I don\'t....\r\n\r\nSMITH. 

Anyone can make a world. It takes ingenuity to make one and then\r\nmake the people on it think that it\'s existed for millions of years.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. How long did all this take you?\r\n\r\nSMITH. Three and a half months. World time.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. What do you mean by that?\r\n\r\nSMITH. Before I made the world I lived beyond time.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Where\'s that?\r\n\r\nSMITH. No where.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. In the cosmos?\r\n\r\nSMITH. That\'s correct.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. You didn\'t like it there?\r\n\r\nSMITH. No. It was boring.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. And that\'s why....\r\n\r\nSMITH. I made the world.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Yes. But ... how did you make it?\r\n\r\nSMITH. I had books.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Books?\r\n\r\nSMITH. Instruction books.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Where did you get them?\r\n\r\nSMITH. I made them up.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. You mean you wrote them?\r\n\r\nSMITH. 

I ... made them up.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. How?\r\n\r\nSMITH. (_Mustache bristling truculently_) I made them up.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. (_Lips pursed_) So there you were out in the cosmos with a\r\nhandful of books.\r\n\r\nSMITH. That\'s correct.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. What if you had dropped them?\r\n\r\nSMITH. (_Chooses not to answer this patent absurdity_)\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Mister Smith.\r\n\r\nSMITH. Yes?\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Who made you?\r\n\r\nSMITH. (_Shakes his head_) I don\'t know.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Were you always like this? (_He points at Mr. Smith\'s lowly\r\nframe._)\r\n\r\nSMITH. I don\'t think so. I think that I was punished.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. For what?\r\n\r\nSMITH. For making the world so complicated.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. I should think so.\r\n\r\nSMITH. It\'s not my fault. I just made it, I didn\'t say it would work\r\nright.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. You just started your machine and then walked away.\r\n\r\nSMITH. That\'s....\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Then what are you doing here?\r\n\r\nSMITH. 

I told you. I think I\'ve been punished.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Oh yes. For making it too complicated. I forgot.\r\n\r\nSMITH. That\'s correct.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Who punished you?\r\n\r\nSMITH. I don\'t remember.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. That\'s convenient.\r\n\r\nSMITH. (_Looks morose_)\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Might it be God?\r\n\r\nSMITH. (_Shrugs_) It might.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. He might have a few fingers in the rest of the Universe.\r\n\r\nSMITH. He might. 

But I made the world.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Enough, Mr. Smith, you did not make the world.\r\n\r\nSMITH. (_Insulted_) Yes, I did too.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. And you created me?\r\n\r\nSMITH. (_Concedingly_) Indirectly.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Then uncreate me.\r\n\r\nSMITH. I can\'t.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Why?\r\n\r\nSMITH. I just started things. I don\'t control them now.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. (_Sighs_) Then what are you worried about, Mr. Smith?\r\n\r\nSMITH. I have a premonition.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. What about?\r\n\r\nSMITH. I\'m going to die.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. So...?\r\n\r\nSMITH. Someone has to take over. Or else.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Or else...?\r\n\r\nSMITH. The whole world will go.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Go where?\r\n\r\nSMITH. No where. Just disappear.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. How can it disappear if it works independently of you?\r\n\r\nSMITH. It will be taken away to punish me.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. You?\r\n\r\nSMITH. Yes.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. You mean if you die, the entire world will disappear?\r\n\r\nSMITH. That\'s correct.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. If I shot you, the instant you died I would disappear?\r\n\r\nSMITH. That\'s....\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. I have advice.\r\n\r\nSMITH. 

Yes? You will help?\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Go to see a reputable psychiatrist.\r\n\r\nSMITH. (_Standing_) I should have known. I have no more to say.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. (_Shrugs_) As you will.\r\n\r\nSMITH. I\'ll go but you\'ll be sorry about this.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. I dare say you are already sorry, Mr. Smith.\r\n\r\nSMITH. Goodbye. (_Mr. Smith exits. Doctor Janishefsky calls for his\r\nnurse over the interphone. Nurse Mudde enters._)\r\n\r\nNURSE M. Yes, doctor?\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Nurse Mudde, stand by the window and tell me what you see.\r\n\r\nNURSE M. What I...?\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. What you see. I want you to tell me what Mr. Smith does after\r\nhe comes out of the building.\r\n\r\nNURSE M. (_Shrugs_) Yes, doctor. (_She goes to the window_)\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Has he come out yet?\r\n\r\nNURSE M. No.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Keep watching.\r\n\r\nNURSE M. There he is. He\'s stepping off the curb. He\'s walking across\r\nthe street.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Yes.\r\n\r\nNURSE M. He\'s stopping now in the middle of the street. He\'s turning.\r\nHe\'s looking up at this window. There\'s a look of ... of ...\r\n_realization_ on his face. He\'s coming back. (_She screams_) He\'s been\r\nhit by a car. He\'s lying on the street....\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. What is it, Nurse Mudde?\r\n\r\nNurse M. (_Reeling_) Everything is ... is _fading_! Doctor Janishefsky,\r\nit\'s fading! (_Another scream_)\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Don\'t be absurd, Nurse Mudde. Look at me. 

Can you honestly\r\nsay that.... (_He stops talking. She cannot honestly say anything. 

She\r\nis not there. Doctor Janishefsky who is not really Doctor Janishefsky\r\nfloats alone in the cosmos in his chair which is not really a chair.\r\nHe looks at the chair beside him._) I hope you\'ve learned your lesson.\r\nI\'m going to put your toy back but don\'t you dare go near it. So you\'re\r\nbored are you? 

Scalliwag! You just behave yourself or I\'ll take away\r\nyour books too! (_He snorts_) So you made them up, did you? (He looks\r\naround). 

How about picking them up, jackanapes!\r\n\r\nSMITH. (_Who is not really Smith_) Yes, father.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


Arak Miller ached\r\n                  for it--too eagerly; too swiftly._\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n                      Planet Stories Winter 1954.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTwenty-five years later a ship appeared, on an afternoon in the\r\nplanet\'s summer.\r\n\r\nArak Miller watched it from the mesa.\r\n\r\n_From Earth_, he thought. _From Earth!_\r\n\r\nBut Arak Miller was an ordered man. Even now, in the face of resurging\r\nvisions of his wife, and his sons, and his work, and the mighty\r\ncivilization from which he had been cut adrift, his thoughts were\r\nordered: probably the ship had arrived from Earth to resurvey one of\r\nthe Class II uninhabitable planets of the Alpha Centaurus System.\r\nTomorrow its scout ships would whip along the day sides at five\r\nthousand feet. Tomorrow atop the mesa he must light his pyres, some\r\nhundred-odd gigantic piles of pine trees and brush that would burn with\r\nbillowing smoke. He must signal the presence of a lone Earthman.\r\n\r\nWith a hypnotic intensity he stood watching the ship until, toward\r\nevening, it merged into the gray sky over the horizon. Then he ran\r\nacross the clearing and down to his house by the river that wound\r\nthrough the valley a thousand feet below. 

"Come on, you fool!" he\r\nshouted to Marbach, sitting beneath a tree. Arak Miller threw the\r\nfigure over his shoulder and carried him to the house. He sat Marbach\r\non a chair and went into the kitchen to eat.\r\n\r\nArak Miller had been nomadic the first few years after he crashed and\r\nhad been abandoned for dead, until he found in the planet\'s narrow\r\ntemperate zone one of the few arable regions capable of sustaining him.\r\nThere was sufficient small game, the river was cool, and because the\r\nrain fell mainly in the valley, his pyres were safe.\r\n\r\nIn recent years he was always building. He had added a front porch to\r\nthe cabin he had started with, then more rooms which he had never\r\nused, then an attic into which he never went. Now it was a house. It\r\nhad chairs and tables, a bed, a rug of vines, a garden for vegetables\r\nand tobacco, and a garden for flowers.\r\n\r\nHe ate a leisurely meal of potatoes and corn and meat of the\r\nrabbit-like creatures which he trapped. Miss Gormeley was sitting on\r\nthe porch as he went out. "A ship\'s come," he shouted. "I may be saved,\r\nyou understand?"\r\n\r\nHe recalled he had intended to do something about Miss Gormeley\'s\r\nnostril. With one of his knives he scraped a little against the wall of\r\nher left nostril. Then he stood back, satisfied. "Now you look better,"\r\nhe said. With a wry grin he added, "You can smell better, too."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor a long time he could not sleep, remembering that he had been cut\r\noff in the prime of his life. He had been the Senior Astrophysicist\r\nin the Systems War Office on Earth, working on the Second Einstein\r\nModifications that promised travel to the more distant galactic\r\nSystems. He had completed six months of comparison spectography in the\r\nbarren Centaurus System and had been about to take the year\'s return\r\njourney to Earth, looking forward to a vacation trip with his family to\r\nVenus City. He had been in the forefront of the free world\'s pushing\r\nback of the last frontiers of man.\r\n\r\nHe twisted on his bed in a wild agony of hope and yearning. "Someday\r\nsoon," he shouted to the walls, "I\'ll ride the monorail across the\r\nWestern plains." He had discovered that it helped, to talk aloud,\r\nthough none of his devices could make him forget he was a prisoner. To\r\nfeel the Centaurus skies closing down on him and the alien mountains\r\ncrushing him, so far from his work and those he loved, was to feel a\r\nterrible suffocation from which there was no release.\r\n\r\nBut then he would go doggedly to work, or else carve the life-size\r\nfigures to keep him silent company, and try to forget.\r\n\r\nHe talked on and on, and finally he could talk no more. He slept.\r\n\r\nHe was awakened by a pattering on the roof.\r\n\r\n"Rain!" he shouted. He jumped up and ran to the window socket. The rain\r\nclouds were high, and heavy with storm.\r\n\r\nIt struck him like a blow: they hung above the mesa.\r\n\r\nAbove his pyres.\r\n\r\nIn a panic he clambered up to the mesa, forgetting his breakfast,\r\nforgetting his outer clothing, his mind in disorder.\r\n\r\nThe shock wave pounded his eardrums.\r\n\r\nHe was too startled to make words. With unbelieving eyes he saw, about\r\nfive miles away where the river emptied into the sea, the black cloud\r\nof an atomic explosion rise into the sky to spread out under the rain.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly he was running blindly through the rain. The scout must\r\nhave come down. 

They must be testing. The area was ideal for testing\r\natomic weapons. _I must reach them before they leave._\r\n\r\nThrough heavy undergrowth he pushed his way down the slope to the\r\nvalley. His foot slipped on an exposed root. With a sharp crack of\r\nbone, he fell.\r\n\r\n"My ankle!" he screamed, with terror smashing at his mind. He managed\r\nto find two thick lengths of branch that would serve as crutches. Then\r\nhe started hobbling awkwardly toward the river.\r\n\r\nFor an hour he forced himself on urgently along the river bank, now\r\nfeeling knife-like pains slicing up through his body. The effort of\r\nmoving was beginning to exhaust him.\r\n\r\nHe fell down, and rested a moment. He heard a tree crash in the forest\r\nahead. He heard someone shout.\r\n\r\nA human voice!\r\n\r\nHe began to sob, softly at first, then uncontrollably. A human voice!\r\nIt had never been so sweet a sound.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe climbed painfully to his feet, crashed on through the undergrowth.\r\nThe density of trees ended abruptly and he stopped. Around the scout\r\nship in the clearing beyond, robot dredges were digging the foundations\r\nfor buildings. Gray-uniformed men were setting up new-type atomic\r\nartillery at the perimeters.\r\n\r\nArak Miller drew a deep breath. "I\'m saved," he said, his voice\r\nbreaking. "I\'m going to be a free man!" He tottered on the edge of\r\nhysteria, but controlled himself with a mighty effort of will.\r\n\r\nHe took a step forward to reach the clearing. Then he stopped.\r\n\r\nSomething was wrong.\r\n\r\nHe tried to put together the pieces of his mind. Everything looked\r\nnormal. Construction going on, stores being transferred to temporary\r\nwarehouses, all the usual activities of a scout party on an atomic\r\ntesting mission. The artillery was pointing--\r\n\r\nThat was the flaw.\r\n\r\nThe artillery faced inward.\r\n\r\nHe looked back at the construction work. "Not foundations for\r\nbuildings," he said dully. "Ditches.

"\r\n\r\nAs he watched, a flag was run up on a pole. The dreams of Arak Miller\r\ncrashed in his mind.\r\n\r\nIt was the flag of the slave world, super-imposed upon the symbol of\r\nthe Systems. The world controlled by the dictators, which for centuries\r\nhad existed alongside the free world in a perpetual cold war. During\r\nsome stage of Arak Miller\'s long imprisonment, from Venus to Centaurus\r\nthe dictators had taken over.\r\n\r\nHidden from guards, he lay on the ground and watched for a long time.\r\nOnly when the next batch of captives was taken out of the scout ship\r\nand lined up in front of the ditch, did he turn his gaze away.\r\n\r\nHe waited till the next shock wave had passed, then with tears\r\nstreaming down his face, hobbled back in the rain toward the river.\r\nHe crawled the last two miles to his house. Miss Gormeley was sitting\r\nwhere he had left her. 

"I am sorry," he said painfully. 

"I will have to\r\ndestroy you. And Marbach. And our house, and the pyres. And when all\r\nthat is done, I will have to leave this area. 

Otherwise they might find\r\nme."\r\n\r\nMiss Gormeley stared blindly out at the river.\r\n\r\nHe lay still on the floor, gasping for breath. "You see," he explained,\r\n"I am not a prisoner. They are the prisoners. All of them. 

All the\r\nworld--but me."\r\n\r\nHis eyes closed in exhaustion. "I like it here now," he said, almost in\r\na whisper. "I intend to stay. 

There must be some place here where they\r\ncan never find me, you understand?"\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


He was thin,\r\ntoo, like his wife, but tall and tough-skinned. His face, with its\r\nleather look was immobile.\r\n\r\n"Why?" asked his wife.\r\n\r\n"Good reasons," the farmer said.\r\n\r\nHe poured yellow cream into a cup of coffee. He let the cup sit on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n"Henry?" said the woman, as though she were really speaking to someone\r\nelse. She walked around the kitchen in quick aimless bird steps.\r\n\r\n"My right," said Henry. He lifted his cup, finally, tasting.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll starve."\r\n\r\n"Not likely. 

Not until everybody else does, anyway."\r\n\r\nThe woman circled the room and came back to her husband. Her eyes\r\nwinked, and there were lines between them. Her fingers clutched the edge\r\nof the table. "You\'ve gone crazy," she said, as though it were a\r\nhalf-question, a half-pronouncement.\r\n\r\nThe farmer was relaxing now, leaning back in his chair. "Might have.\r\nMight have, at that."\r\n\r\n"_Why?_" she asked.\r\n\r\nThe farmer turned his coffee cup carefully. "Thing to do, is all. Each\r\nman in his own turn. This is my turn."\r\n\r\nThe woman watched him for a long time, then she sat down on a chair\r\nbeside the table. The quick, nervous movement was gone out of her, and\r\nshe sat like a frozen sparrow.\r\n\r\nThe farmer looked up and grinned. "Feels good. 

Just to sit here. Does\r\nwell for the back and the arms. 

Been working too hard."\r\n\r\n"Henry," the woman said.\r\n\r\nThe farmer tasted his coffee again. He put the cup on the table and\r\nleaned back, tapping his browned fingers. "Just in time, I\'d say. 

Waited\r\nany longer, it wouldn\'t have done any good. Another few years, a farmer\r\nwouldn\'t mean anything."\r\n\r\nThe woman watched him, her eyes frightened as though he might suddenly\r\ngnash his teeth or leap in the air.\r\n\r\n"Pretty soon," the farmer said, "they\'d have it all mechanical. Couldn\'t\r\nstop anything. Now," he said, smiling at his wife, "we can stop it all."\r\n\r\n"Henry, go out to the fields," the woman said.\r\n\r\n"No," Henry said, standing, stretching his thin, hard body. "I won\'t go\r\nout to the fields. Neither will August Brown nor Clyde Briggs nor Alfred\r\nSwanson. None of us. 

Anywhere. Not until the food\'s been stopped long\r\nenough for people to wake up."\r\n\r\nThe farmer looked out of the kitchen window, beyond his tractor and the\r\ncow barn and the windmill. He looked at rows of strong corn, shivering\r\ntheir soft silk in the morning breeze. "We\'ll stop the corn. Stop the\r\nwheat. Stop the cattle, the hogs, the chickens."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t."\r\n\r\n"_I_ can\'t. But all of us together can."\r\n\r\n"No sense," the woman said, wagging her head. "No sense."\r\n\r\n"It\'s sense, all right. Best sense we\'ve ever had. Can\'t use an army\r\nwith no stomach. Old as the earth. Can\'t fight without food. Takes food\r\nto run a war."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll starve the two of us, that\'s all you\'ll do. Nobody else will\r\nstop work."\r\n\r\nThe farmer turned to his wife. "Yes, they will. Everywhere a farmer is\r\nthe same. He works the land. He reads the papers. He votes. He listens\r\nto the radio. He watches the television. Mostly, he works the land.\r\nAlone, with his own thoughts and ideas. He isn\'t any different in Maine\r\nthan he is in Oregon. We\'ve all stopped work. 

Now. 

This morning."\r\n\r\n"How about those across the ocean? Are they stopping, too? They\'re not\r\ngoing to feed up their soldiers? To kill us if we don\'t starve first?\r\nTo--"\r\n\r\n"They stopped, too. A farmer is a farmer. Like a leaf on a tree. No\r\nmatter on what tree in what country on whose land. A leaf is a leaf. A\r\nfarmer\'s the same. A farmer is a farmer."\r\n\r\n"It won\'t work," the woman said dully.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it will."\r\n\r\n"They\'ll _make_ you work."\r\n\r\n"How? It\'s our own property."\r\n\r\n"They\'ll take it away from you."\r\n\r\n"Who\'ll work it then?"\r\n\r\nThe woman rocked in her chair, her mouth quivering. "They\'ll get\r\nsomebody."\r\n\r\nThe farmer shook his head. "Too many people doing other things, like\r\nmaking shells and guns, like sitting in fox-holes or flying planes."\r\n\r\nThe woman sat rocking, her hands together in her lap. "It won\'t work,"\r\nshe repeated.\r\n\r\n"It\'ll work," said the farmer. "Right _now_, it\'ll work. Yes, we\'ve got\r\nmilkers and shuckers, and we\'ve got hatchers for the chickens. We\'ve got\r\ntractors and combines and threshing machines. They\'re all mechanical,\r\nall right. But we don\'t have mechanical farmers, yet. The pumps, the\r\ntractors, the milkers don\'t work by themselves. In time, maybe. Not now.\r\nWe\'re still ahead of them on that. 

It\'ll work."\r\n\r\n"Go out to the fields, Henry," his wife said, her voice like the sound\r\nof a worn phonograph record.\r\n\r\n"No," the farmer said, taking a pipe from his overalls. "I think\r\ninstead, I\'ll just sit in the sun and watch the corn. Watch the birds on\r\ntop of the barn, maybe. I\'ll fill my pipe and sit there and smoke and\r\nwatch. And when I get sleepy, I\'ll sleep. After a while I might go see\r\nAugust Brown or Clyde Briggs or maybe Alfred Swanson. We\'ll sit and\r\ntalk, about pleasant things, peaceful things. 

We\'ll wait."\r\n\r\nThe farmer put the pipe between his teeth and walked to the door. He put\r\non his straw hat, buttoned the sleeves of his blue shirt and stepped\r\noutside.\r\n\r\nHis wife sat at the table, staring at nothing in the room.\r\n\r\nThe farmer walked across the barnyard, listening to the sound of the\r\nchickens and the sound of the breeze going through the corn. Near the\r\nbarn, he sat upon an old tree stump and filled his pipe with tobacco. He\r\nlit the pipe, cupping his hands, and sat there, smoking, the smoke\r\nspiraling up into the bright warm air.\r\n\r\nHe took his pipe from his teeth and looked at it. "Pipe of peace," he\r\nsaid, laughing inside himself.\r\n\r\nThe breeze was soft and the sun warm on his back. He sat there, smoking,\r\nfeeling the quiet of the morning, the peace of the great sky above.\r\n\r\nHe had no time to stand or to take his pipe from his mouth, when the two\r\nmen crossed the yard and lifted him up by the arms. He dropped the pipe,\r\nwhile he was dragged past the house, to the road beyond. He had no time\r\nto yell or scream, before his hat was swept from his head, the overalls\r\nand the blue shirt stripped from his body.\r\n\r\nHe had not even thought about what it was that had happened, before he\r\nwas thrust inside a white truck, with strong steel sides and with\r\ngrilled windows like those of a cell.\r\n\r\nHe was just sitting there, in the truck, without his clothes, speeding\r\naway with August Brown and Clyde Briggs and Alfred Swanson.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOutside, the sun was warm upon the earth. Chickens clucked in their\r\npens, while birds fluttered about the top of the barn. 

A pig squealed.\r\nThe corn rustled. And beside the farmhouse, on the ground, lay a pipe,\r\nits tobacco spilled, the last of its smoke swirling out of its bowl into\r\nthe air, disappearing.\r\n\r\nThe woman sat in the kitchen of the farmhouse and turned her head when\r\nthe door opened. She widened her eyes and caught at her throat with her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nThe sun through the doorway shone down on metallic hands and a metallic\r\nface, gleaming on the surface which the straw hat and the overalls and\r\nthe blue shirt didn\'t hide. The door snapped shut, and there was a sound\r\nof heavy metal footsteps against the kitchen floor.\r\n\r\nThe woman pressed against her chair. "Who are you?" she screamed.\r\n\r\n"Henry," said the mechanical thing.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _If Worlds of Science Fiction_ May\r\n    1953.

Our space was remarkably limited. This shelter had been\r\na part of the cellar. It had been blocked off and roofed over, but\r\neven so, part of it fell in--the part with the supplies and stuff--the\r\npart opening on the exit.\r\n\r\n"Well," I said, just to say something, "what do we do now? Sit around\r\nand wait to die?"\r\n\r\nThe little old man wrinkled his brow in thought. He didn\'t seem too\r\nworried about dying. I guess when you\'re his age and have a long gray\r\nbeard you get reconciled to the prospect. But I was young, and frankly\r\nI didn\'t like the idea at all.\r\n\r\n"I think I know a way," the little old man said finally, "but it will\r\nseem like madness. Probably it is. 

It\'s never been tried. It may never\r\nwork."\r\n\r\nI seized him by the lapels. "Any way is better than none. 

I\'d rather\r\ndie trying than sitting down moping my life away. Tell it to me."\r\n\r\n"You won\'t laugh? You will take whatever I say seriously?" the little\r\nold man asked anxiously.\r\n\r\nI saw he didn\'t want to die the object of scorn, and I saw also that he\r\nmust have something pretty odd up his sleeve. "No," I answered, "you\r\nwon\'t hear a peep out of me."\r\n\r\n"Then," said the old man, "if you can prepare yourself, you could walk\r\nout through the rocks."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn spite of my promise, I gasped. But then I squelched myself and\r\nthought that if I was with a lunatic, I might as well make the most\r\nof it. He was now the other half of my universe and so standards had\r\nchanged. Facing death, any straw will do.\r\n\r\n"Proceed," I said. 

"Explain further."\r\n\r\n"Rocks," said the little old man--I guess he must have been a scientist\r\nof some sort--"and all other matter are composed of nothing mainly,\r\nwith a little vibration thrown in."\r\n\r\nI kept my mouth shut. I wasn\'t going to say anything to the contrary\r\neven if he claimed black was white.\r\n\r\n"Matter," he went on, "is composed entirely of atom. Atoms are broken\r\ndown to electrons and protons and their kin. They, in turn, appear to\r\nbe nothing but charges of electricity, charges of energy, not matter.\r\nSo that all matter is really just a manifestation of energy in a\r\npeculiar state of stress."\r\n\r\nI waited. 

This made sense. I began to recognize some of the things I\r\nhad learned years ago in high school physics.\r\n\r\n"Between the vortices of energy which make up the building-blocks of\r\nmatter, there are comparatively vast stretches of just plain empty\r\nspace. Within the atom, almost all is vacuum. Between molecules, more\r\nvacuum. In a so-called solid mass, it could be demonstrated that less\r\nthan a quadrillionth part of its mass has any reality and that only\r\nin the form of disturbances of energy. And that figure is grossly\r\nexaggerated.

"\r\n\r\nI waited. 

This was still making sense. And anyway, when you are\r\nhopelessly trapped there is no sense in being impatient.\r\n\r\n"If," went on the professor, "you understand this and project the\r\npicture of it in your mind, you can mentally resolve all things into\r\nswirls of nothingness, into less than air. If you can do so, you can\r\nattain complete control over your own body--for we alone are able to\r\ncontrol our own masses by means of will.\r\n\r\n"And if you can picture these masses of rock as pools of nothing and\r\nyourself as the same, you can pass yourself through these rocks as a\r\nwhiff of smoke in air. You can revisualize yourself as solid outside\r\nthis trapping pile."\r\n\r\nI thought about it. Wild it was and yet based on real reasoning.\r\n\r\n"If you will give your mind to me, let me hypnotize you with your\r\ncooperation, I think I can cause that to happen. You will then pass\r\nthrough the rocks and appear outside. 

Then you will send for me," he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nI thought that over. "Why don\'t you do it yourself?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"I am old and it is better done with an outside subject. Do not forget\r\nthat this has never been done."\r\n\r\n"Okay. Start," I said, suddenly making up my mind. I didn\'t want to die\r\nand I would do anything, however wild, to avoid it. When one sits alone\r\nin darkness beneath a ruined house and knows that there is no hope, a\r\ndecision like this comes normally.\r\n\r\nAll is logical according to the conditions given.\r\n\r\nI gave him my flashlight and he shone it in my eyes. Then he started\r\nweaving it and repeating what he had said about atoms and electrons and\r\nmasses of nothing.\r\n\r\nI watched him fascinated, and I thought of little whirlpools in empty\r\nblack space. I saw flashing ripples on a void. I saw lone lights\r\nuntended in nothingness and reflected from nothing. And I saw that they\r\nwere glowing from nothing. Light, just light.\r\n\r\nI saw a solitary mote pursuing an endless track across a vast area that\r\nwas utter abyss.\r\n\r\nGradually the flashlight seemed to flicker and die. I felt wavy and\r\nmistlike. I understood the meaning of matter and I saw indeed that\r\nmatter has very little real existence.\r\n\r\nI felt that I was upon my feet, and they were long columns of\r\nimagination having no reality save for endless electric foam.\r\n\r\nI felt myself moving forward and I felt other disturbances passing\r\nbetween me and around me and through me.\r\n\r\nThen I saw that scenes were passing before my vision and the globules\r\nof vacua that were my eyes seemed to register as they passed through\r\nother globules of vacua.\r\n\r\nI saw what seemed like a tiny planet spinning on its axis, while a\r\nstrange blue sun shone down and a dozen other planets swirled.\r\n\r\nI saw a figure indescribable, mounted upon a thing incredible, pursuing\r\nthe unknowable across a vast and meaningless place.\r\n\r\nI saw dozens of things like this--none of which can be described. Once\r\nI saw a large machine with churning arms and it was all bubbly and yet\r\nhard and mechanical.\r\n\r\nAll about me moved a great current and a wave of feelingless substance.\r\n\r\nThen I felt a beating of forces upon me, I felt a hammering at me and I\r\nfelt a pressure pushing upon the whirling, imaginary pools of my being\r\nand a curious coldness setting in.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI shivered and looked around. I was naked in the middle of the street;\r\nthe stars were out and the drone of airplanes audible. People were\r\nrunning up and down and a hose was playing upon the front of a burning\r\nbuilding. The wardens were digging in some ruins with crowbars and\r\nshovels.\r\n\r\nA man came running up to me and threw a blanket over my trembling\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\n"Where\'d you come from? Bomb blow your clothes off? It happens."\r\n\r\nI pointed to the pile of bricks and junk that marked my house.\r\n\r\n"There\'s a man buried in those ruins, but he\'s alive," I said. "Just\r\ntrapped. 

You\'ll have to dig him out."\r\n\r\nThe warden blew his whistle and out of the turmoil three other men came\r\nwith picks and equipment and began to dig.\r\n\r\nBut it was two days before they finally got to him--and by that time he\r\nwas dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


In fact, every possible\r\n    factor was covered--except one of the flaws of human nature...._\r\n\r\n\r\nDaptine is the secret of it. Adaptine, they called it first; then it got\r\nshortened to daptine. It let us adapt.\r\n\r\nThey explained it all to us when we were ten years old; I guess they\r\nthought we were too young to understand before then, although we knew a\r\nlot of it already. They told us just after we landed on Mars.\r\n\r\n"You\'re _home_, children," the Head Teacher told us after we had gone\r\ninto the glassite dome they\'d built for us there. And he told us there\'d\r\nbe a special lecture for us that evening, an important one that we\r\nmust all attend.\r\n\r\nAnd that evening he told us the whole story and the whys and wherefores.\r\nHe stood up before us. He had to wear a heated space suit and helmet, of\r\ncourse, because the temperature in the dome was comfortable for us but\r\nalready freezing cold for him and the air was already too thin for him\r\nto breathe. His voice came to us by radio from inside his helmet.\r\n\r\n"Children," he said, "you are home. This is Mars, the planet on which\r\nyou will spend the rest of your lives. You are Martians, the first\r\nMartians. You have lived five years on Earth and another five in space.\r\nNow you will spend ten years, until you are adults, in this dome,\r\nalthough toward the end of that time you will be allowed to spend\r\nincreasingly long periods outdoors.\r\n\r\n"Then you will go forth and make your own homes, live your own lives, as\r\nMartians. You will intermarry and your children will breed true. 

They\r\ntoo will be Martians.\r\n\r\n"It is time you were told the history of this great experiment of which\r\neach of you is a part."\r\n\r\nThen he told us.\r\n\r\nMan, he said, had first reached Mars in 1985. It had been uninhabited by\r\nintelligent life (there is plenty of plant life and a few varieties of\r\nnon-flying insects) and he had found it by terrestrial standards\r\nuninhabitable. Man could survive on Mars only by living inside glassite\r\ndomes and wearing space suits when he went outside of them. Except by\r\nday in the warmer seasons it was too cold for him. The air was too thin\r\nfor him to breathe and long exposure to sunlight--less filtered of rays\r\nharmful to him than on Earth because of the lesser atmosphere--could\r\nkill him. The plants were chemically alien to him and he could not eat\r\nthem; he had to bring all his food from Earth or grow it in hydroponic\r\ntanks.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor fifty years he had tried to colonize Mars and all his efforts had\r\nfailed. Besides this dome which had been built for us there was only one\r\nother outpost, another glassite dome much smaller and less than a mile\r\naway.\r\n\r\nIt had looked as though mankind could never spread to the other planets\r\nof the solar system besides Earth for of all of them Mars was the least\r\ninhospitable; if he couldn\'t live here there was no use even trying to\r\ncolonize the others.\r\n\r\nAnd then, in 2034, thirty years ago, a brilliant biochemist named\r\nWaymoth had discovered daptine. A miracle drug that worked not on the\r\nanimal or person to whom it was given, but on the progeny he conceived\r\nduring a limited period of time after inoculation.\r\n\r\nIt gave his progeny almost limitless adaptability to changing\r\nconditions, provided the changes were made gradually.\r\n\r\nDr. Waymoth had inoculated and then mated a pair of guinea pigs; they\r\nhad borne a litter of five and by placing each member of the litter\r\nunder different and gradually changing conditions, he had obtained\r\namazing results. When they attained maturity one of those guinea pigs\r\nwas living comfortably at a temperature of forty below zero Fahrenheit,\r\nanother was quite happy at a hundred and fifty above. A third was\r\nthriving on a diet that would have been deadly poison for an ordinary\r\nanimal and a fourth was contented under a constant X-ray bombardment\r\nthat would have killed one of its parents within minutes.\r\n\r\nSubsequent experiments with many litters showed that animals who had\r\nbeen adapted to similar conditions bred true and their progeny was\r\nconditioned from birth to live under those conditions.\r\n\r\n"Ten years later, ten years ago," the Head Teacher told us, "you\r\nchildren were born. Born of parents carefully selected from those who\r\nvolunteered for the experiment. And from birth you have been brought up\r\nunder carefully controlled and gradually changing conditions.\r\n\r\n"From the time you were born the air you have breathed has been very\r\ngradually thinned and its oxygen content reduced. Your lungs have\r\ncompensated by becoming much greater in capacity, which is why your\r\nchests are so much larger than those of your teachers and attendants;\r\nwhen you are fully mature and are breathing air like that of Mars, the\r\ndifference will be even greater.\r\n\r\n"Your bodies are growing fur to enable you to stand the increasing cold.\r\nYou are comfortable now under conditions which would kill ordinary\r\npeople quickly. Since you were four years old your nurses and teachers\r\nhave had to wear special protection to survive conditions that seem\r\nnormal to you.\r\n\r\n"In another ten years, at maturity, you will be completely acclimated to\r\nMars. Its air will be your air; its food plants your food. 

Its extremes\r\nof temperature will be easy for you to endure and its median\r\ntemperatures pleasant to you. Already, because of the five years we\r\nspent in space under gradually decreased gravitational pull, the gravity\r\nof Mars seems normal to you.\r\n\r\n"It will be your planet, to live on and to populate. You are the\r\nchildren of Earth but you are the first Martians."\r\n\r\nOf course we had known a lot of those things already.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe last year was the best. 

By then the air inside the dome--except for\r\nthe pressurized parts where our teachers and attendants live--was almost\r\nlike that outside, and we were allowed out for increasingly long\r\nperiods. It is good to be in the open.\r\n\r\nThe last few months they relaxed segregation of the sexes so we could\r\nbegin choosing mates, although they told us there is to be no marriage\r\nuntil after the final day, after our full clearance. Choosing was not\r\ndifficult in my case. 

I had made my choice long since and I\'d felt sure\r\nthat she felt the same way; I was right.\r\n\r\nTomorrow is the day of our freedom. Tomorrow we will be Martians, _the_\r\nMartians. Tomorrow we shall take over the planet.\r\n\r\nSome among us are impatient, have been impatient for weeks now, but\r\nwiser counsel prevailed and we are waiting. We have waited twenty years\r\nand we can wait until the final day.\r\n\r\nAnd tomorrow is the final day.\r\n\r\nTomorrow, at a signal, we will kill the teachers and the other Earthmen\r\namong us before we go forth. They do not suspect, so it will be easy.\r\n\r\nWe have dissimulated for years now, and they do not know how we hate\r\nthem. They do not know how disgusting and hideous we find them, with\r\ntheir ugly misshapen bodies, so narrow-shouldered and tiny-chested,\r\ntheir weak sibilant voices that need amplification to carry in our\r\nMartian air, and above all their white pasty hairless skins.\r\n\r\nWe shall kill them and then we shall go and smash the other dome so all\r\nthe Earthmen there will die too.\r\n\r\nIf more Earthmen ever come to punish us, we can live and hide in the\r\nhills where they\'ll never find us. And if they try to build more domes\r\nhere we\'ll smash them. We want no more to do with Earth.\r\n\r\nThis is our planet and we want no aliens. Keep off!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ March 1954.

I thought few wiser or greater men ever lived. In my eyes he\r\nwas greater than Babe Ruth, Lindy, or the President.\r\n\r\nOf course, time, and my growing up caused me to bring him into a\r\nperspective that I felt to be more consonant with his true position in\r\nhis field of endeavor. When he died his friends mourned for fond\r\nremembrance of things past, but privately many of them felt that he had\r\noutlived his best days. Now with this glorious vindication, I wonder how\r\nmany of them are still alive to feel the twinge of conscience....\r\n\r\nOh, we\'re delighted of course, but it seems incredible even today to us\r\nelated oldsters. Although we were always his staunchest admirers, in\r\nretrospect we can see now that no one believed more than we that he did\r\nit strictly for the dollar. It is likely there was always a small corps\r\nof starry-eyed adolescents who found the whole improbable saga entirely\r\nbelievable, or at least half believed it might be partly true. The\r\nattitude of the rest of us ranged from a patronizing disparagement that\r\nwe thought was expected of us, through grudging admiration, to\r\nout-and-out enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nCertainly if anybody had taken the trouble to consider it--and why\r\nshould they have?--the landing of the first manned ship on our satellite\r\nseemed to render him as obsolete as a horde of other lesser and even\r\ngreater lights. At any rate, it was inevitable that the conquest of the\r\nmoon would be merely a stepping-stone to more distant points.\r\n\r\nOh, no, I had nothing to do with the selection of the Red Planet. Coming\r\nin as head of Project P-4 in its latter stages, as I did when Dr.\r\nFredericks died, the selection had already been made. Yes, it\'s quite\r\nlikely I may have been plugging for Mars below the conscious level. A\r\ncombination of chance, expediency and popular demand made Mars the next\r\ntarget, rather than Venus, which was, in some ways, the more logical\r\ngoal. I would have given anything to have gone, but the metaphorical\r\nstout heart that one reporter once credited me with is not the same as\r\nan old man\'s actual fatty heart.\r\n\r\nAnd there were heartbreak years ahead before the _Goddard_ was finally\r\nready. During this time he slipped further into obscurity while big,\r\nimportant things were happening all around us. 

You\'re right, that one\r\nreally big creation of his _is_ bigger than ever. It has passed into the\r\nlanguage, and meant employment for thousands of people. Too few of them\r\nhave even heard of him. Of course, he was still known and welcomed by a\r\nsmall circle of acquaintances, but to the world at large he was truly a\r\n"forgotten man."\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of note that one of the oldest of these acquaintances was\r\npresent at blast-off time. He happened to be the grandfather of a\r\ncertain competent young crewman. The old man was a proud figure during\r\nthe brief ceremonies and his eyes filled with tears as the mighty rocket\r\nclimbed straight up on its fiery tail. He remained there gazing up at\r\nthe sky long after it had vanished.\r\n\r\nHe was heard to murmur, "I am glad the kid could go, but it is just a\r\nlark to him. 

He never had a \'sense of wonder.\' How could he--nobody\r\nreads anymore."\r\n\r\nAfterward, his senile emotions betraying him, he broke down completely\r\nand had to be led from the field. It is rumored he did not live long\r\nafter that.\r\n\r\nThe _Goddard_ drove on until Mars filled the viz-screen. It was planned\r\nto make at least a half-dozen braking passes around the planet for\r\nobservational purposes before the actual business of bringing the ship\r\nin for landfall began. 

As expected the atmosphere proved to be thin. 

The\r\nspeculated dead-sea areas, oddly enough, turned out to be just that. To\r\nthe surprise of some, it was soon evident that Mars possessed, or had\r\npossessed, a high civilization. The _canali_ of Schiaparelli were indeed\r\nbroad waterways stretching from pole to pole, too regular to be anything\r\nbut the work of intelligence. But most wonderful of all were the\r\nscattered, but fairly numerous large, walled cities that dotted the\r\nworld. Everybody was excited, eager to land and start exercising their\r\nspecialties.\r\n\r\nOne of the largest of these cities was selected more or less at random.\r\nIt was decided to set down just outside, yet far enough from the walls\r\nto avoid any possibility of damage from the landing jets in the event\r\nthe city was inhabited. Even if deserted, the entire scientific\r\npersonnel would have raised a howl that would have been heard back on\r\nEarth if just a section of wall was scorched. When planet-fall was\r\ncompleted and observers had time to scan the surroundings it was seen\r\nthat the city was very much alive.\r\n\r\n"What keeps them up!" marvelled Kopchainski, the aeronautics and\r\nrocketry authority.\r\n\r\nThe sky swarmed with ships of strange design. The walls were crowded\r\nwith inhabitants, too far away for detailed observation. 

Even as they\r\nlooked an enormous gate opened and a procession of mounted figures\r\nemerged. In the event the place was deserted, the Captain would have had\r\nthe honor of being the first to touch Martian soil. While atmospheric\r\nand other checks were being run, he gave orders for the previously\r\ndecided alternative. Captain, semanticist and anthropologist would make\r\nthe First Contact.\r\n\r\nWith all checks agreeing that it was safe to open locks, soon the three\r\nrepresentatives of Earth were walking shoulder to shoulder down the\r\nramp. It was apparent that the two scientists purposely missed stride\r\ninches from the end, so that it was the Captain\'s foot that actually\r\ntouched ground first.\r\n\r\nThe cavalcade--though these beasties were certainly not horses--was now\r\nnear enough to the ship for details to be seen. Surprise and wonderment\r\nfilled the crew, for while the multi-legged steeds were as alien as\r\nanyone might expect to find on an alien world, the riders were very\r\ndefinitely humanoid. Briefly, brightly and barbarically trapped as they\r\nwere by earthly standards, they seemed to be little distinguishable from\r\nhomegrown homo saps.\r\n\r\nThe approaching company appeared to be armed mainly with swords and\r\nlances, but also in evidence were some tubular affairs that could very\r\nwell be some sort of projectile-discharging device. The Captain suddenly\r\nfelt unaccountably warm. It was a heavy responsibility--he hoped these\r\nMartians wouldn\'t be the type of madmen who believed in the "shoot\r\nfirst, inquire later" theory.\r\n\r\nEven as he stood there, outwardly calm but jittering internally, the\r\nMartian riders pulled up ten feet from the Earthmen. Their leader, tall,\r\ndark-haired, and subtly lighter in hue than his companions, dismounted\r\nand approached the Captain. With outstretched hand he took the Captain\'s\r\nin a firm grip.\r\n\r\nLet it be recorded here, to the shame of an Earth where reading for\r\npleasure is virtually a lost pastime, that not one man on the _Goddard_\r\nrealized the significance of what followed.\r\n\r\n"How do you do?" he said in perfect English, with an unmistakable trace\r\nof Southern accent.\r\n\r\n"Welcome to Barsoom! My name is John Carter.

]\r\n\r\n\r\nHer fingers lightly caressed a button on the long table as she\r\nhalf-turned toward him. At this moment, she was glad they still wore\r\nthe semi-barbaric accoutrements donned for last night\'s festivities,\r\ncommemorating the conclusion of the final war--weird, fantastic\r\ntrappings, selected more for adornment than for approximations of\r\nancient military dress--for he would not notice that she was trembling.\r\nWhen at last she spoke, her voice was steady.\r\n\r\n"Please go now, quickly."\r\n\r\nHis hand made as if to clasp her arm, then dropped to his side. 

For an\r\ninstant he stood there, words welling to his lips, then, with a half\r\nshrug he turned away. She did not move as he strode toward the doorway,\r\nglanced out the window; her back was a picture of composure.\r\n\r\n"Natalla!" It was not a command, or yet a call, but a cry of\r\nastonishment blended with horror. Gone was her carefully built-up\r\npoise as she whirled, then gasped as she saw the look in his eyes.\r\nSwiftly she hurried toward the window, but he stood in front of her,\r\nblocking her view.\r\n\r\n"What is it, Eric?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t look," he gasped. For a moment she felt fear coursing through\r\nher, fear that at this moment he would wilt, give way to terror.\r\nShe bit her lips, telling herself she couldn\'t endure the sight of\r\nit. But, an instant later, the panic had left him; she could see\r\nrugged determination flowing back into his being. Almost faint with\r\nthankfulness for the strength of him, she relaxed against his body,\r\npermitted him to lead her across the room to a sofa.\r\n\r\n"Do you remember Greer?" His voice was analytically thoughtful. "He was\r\nthe little astronomer who made those startlingly radical predictions\r\nabout a year ago. Remember how we all checked his data? 

No one could\r\nfind anything of the sort, even though we checked and re-checked a\r\ndozen times. The conclusion was the only one that could be drawn under\r\nsuch circumstances; Greer was suffering from delusions. So he was cured\r\nby the psychiatry department."\r\n\r\nHer nose wrinkled in concentration. "Greer? Wasn\'t he the one who\r\nclaimed to have discovered a sort of gaseous cloud in space? Our system\r\nwas supposed to be approaching it; when it reached our atmosphere, it\r\nwould prove a deadly poison to all life-forms on this planet."\r\n\r\n"Yes--that\'s it. 

Well, it seems he was right. It\'s come--the green\r\ncloud. All I could see out that window was the nauseous swirls of it,\r\nand the people where they\'d fallen in the streets. Neither of us can\r\nleave this building." He snapped on the tele-screen. It lit up; he\r\ncould hear the faint hum of the machinery, but no images appeared.\r\n"Dead!"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _All I could see out the window was green whirls of\r\nit--and people where they had fallen!_]\r\n\r\n"Eric, it couldn\'t be."\r\n\r\nHe paced up and down the floor, clasping and unclasping his hands. 

"I\r\ndon\'t know. It came without warning on a night when nearly everyone\r\nwas out celebrating. No one in the streets or parks could have been\r\nprepared for it. Most of the dwellings were probably left with windows\r\nopened. It\'s only sheer luck that it wasn\'t the case here. 

And luck\r\nagain that we came back early."\r\n\r\n"Please sit down," she begged. He looked at her a moment, then\r\nshrugged, came over to the sofa, and sat beside her. "There must have\r\nbeen some, Eric," she said.\r\n\r\n"The law of averages would seem to indicate that. There might be some\r\nwho are naturally immune to whatever brand of poison this is; some who\r\nescaped as did we; some who were underground, or in forests. But until\r\nwe learn differently, we must assume that we are the only humans alive."\r\n\r\nHis eyes were haunted. "How could we have missed it?" he whispered. "We\r\nchecked and re-checked all the data, and put it to the calculating\r\nmachines. The answer was the same each time: no such cloud existed."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps there were some factors that only Greer himself knew. Some\r\nsmall items concerning his calculations which he overlooked in\r\npresenting data, not realizing that it had influenced him. If one\r\nfactor were missing, known only to Greer, then all the machines in the\r\nworld might well give a negative result."\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. "It\'s fantastic--yet, what can we think? If your\r\nidea of a missing factor is correct, we\'ll never know. Even if Greer is\r\nstill alive. He was cured of his delusion."\r\n\r\nShe was silent for a moment, then she slipped off her gloves, laid a\r\nhand on his arm. "Eric," she whispered. 

"I\'m sorry it had to happen at\r\na time like this. It may be that Sandra escaped, too. I know what she\r\nmeans to you. 

If we find her, later, I shan\'t stand in the way."\r\n\r\nHe chewed his lips. "That\'s all over, now. The first thing we must do\r\nis to check up on the food, water, and sanitation system. Just how long\r\nthe machines will run without human supervision is questionable--not\r\nlong, at any rate. The robots cannot do everything alone, either."\r\n\r\nHer eyes were calm and clear, her voice a breath of cool air in the\r\nheat of his anguish. "Then let\'s do it the same way, Eric. Nothing\r\nis going to happen for awhile. 

Let\'s tackle the problem after we\'re\r\nrefreshed." She moved to free herself from him; he had, automatically,\r\nslipped his arm around her waist, drawn her to him. "You--you can use\r\nthe lab for your quarters. Good night, Eric."\r\n\r\nHe held her back. "Natalla."\r\n\r\n"Let me go," she murmured.\r\n\r\n"Natalla, wait. I didn\'t tell you all I saw. 

It was more than--the\r\ncloud." He fell silent, breathing rapidly.\r\n\r\n"Well?" she said.\r\n\r\n"I was reading some of the old books yesterday. Some of them centuries\r\nold. The people then, most of them, didn\'t live as well as we do but\r\nthey were very much like us in some other ways.\r\n\r\n"They--well, sometimes a man would think he had fallen out of harmony\r\nwith his mate. In this book, the man thought he\'d found another woman\r\nmore suitable to his psyche. He was about to obtain a release--divorce\r\nI think they used to call it--when she was injured in an accident. His\r\nmate, I mean. The medical experts did not think she could live.\r\n\r\n"He realized then, when it seemed to be too late, that there could\r\nnever be any other mate for him. They didn\'t have psychoadjusters in\r\nthose days, so, if she died, he would be affected for many years. The\r\nonly way emotional upsets could wear off was through the primitive\r\nprocess of letting time wear them down, little by little. It all ended\r\nwell, however, because medical experts discovered that it was only her\r\npsyche that made the injury seem fatal; when she found that he still\r\nwanted her to be his mate, she recovered."\r\n\r\n"Eric, what are you trying to tell me?"\r\n\r\n"That I don\'t want to be released from you ever. Even if this had never\r\nhappened, if what I saw out there was only my imagination.\r\n\r\n"I know now that I was only deceiving myself when I sought release\r\nfrom you. Sandra? Well, I rather like her, but she could never take\r\nyour place. I still wish to be your mate, Natalla."\r\n\r\nHer eyes answered him, he thought.\r\n\r\n"You\'re tired, Eric. But perhaps you\'d better not spend the night in\r\nthe lab after all."\r\n\r\nHe reached down, picked her up in his arms. "In the old days," he said,\r\n"it was considered particularly fine form for a man to carry his mate\r\nto their sleeping quarters."\r\n\r\nShe smiled and buried her face against his shoulder. No need to tell\r\nhim that she, too, had read the old books. Or that she\'d rigged up a\r\nz-special screen outside that window, projected a carefully-made film\r\non it. After all, _she_ hadn\'t seen the green cloud. He\'d held her\r\nback. And hadn\'t he mentioned something about it being his imagination.\r\n\r\nShe wouldn\'t be too harsh on him, of course, tomorrow morning when all\r\nwas discovered to be well. And she was positive that he hadn\'t noticed\r\nher fingers slide over the button as she leaned against the table a\r\nmoment ago, the button summoning a robot, pre-instructed to dismantle\r\nthe apparatus.\r\n\r\n24th Century or no 24th Century, men were still such dear fools.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


We had corn to get in, besides which we had a bit of\r\na scare around here with lights flashing in the hills and funny noises\r\nat night. The fellows who know call that sort of thing by some fancy\r\nname. "Mass illusionations," I guess they\'d say.\r\n\r\nWell, one night we sat down to chow. We\'d worked hard all day, so we\r\nwere filling ourselves as full as we could. Ma is a right good cook\r\nwhen she bothers, and the girls do all right by themselves. When we\r\nfinished, Joey pops up. 

I think it was Joey. I can\'t rightly remember.\r\nWhen you got ten kids and ten names to keep track of you\'re bound to\r\nhave a hard time remembering.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, one of the kids pops up and says, "Look, Pa! Willie\'s plate is\r\nall full up with chow and no Willie."\r\n\r\nMa looks down the row and tallies them up. Sure thing, nine kids and no\r\nWillie. I kind of wondered why Willie wasn\'t around. He\'s usually the\r\nfirst to eat and the last to stop. 

Ma looked worried.\r\n\r\n"Well," I says. "Pass his plate. Don\'t want any food to go to waste."\r\nSo, the plate is passed down to me. By the time it goes down the line\r\nof kids there\'s one porkchop left. I eat the porkchop and forget about\r\nWillie for a while.\r\n\r\nNext morning, Joey comes up and says Willie wasn\'t home last night.\r\n\r\n"So," I says. "Willie wasn\'t home last night. Where\'s breakfast?" Ma\r\nlooks worried. Like I say Ma always liked Willie.\r\n\r\n"OK, Ma," I pipes up. "We\'ll ask the neighbors. It\'d be easy to spot\r\nWillie anywhere." 

That\'s what I figured. Even though I hate to say it\r\nabout my own son, Willie was plumb peculiar to look at. He had a head\r\nthat looked like it belonged on a man a hundred pounds heavier. It sat\r\nlike a knob on the end of a scrawny, skinny body. A body too scrawny to\r\nbe much use in farming.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe sure was dumb too, that Willie. If you put him out to plow a\r\nstraight line, he\'d plow a circle. If you wanted him to plow a curve,\r\nhe\'d plow a zig-zag line. He wasn\'t like the other boys. Willie got\r\nkicked out of school when he was eight. Not that the other boys\r\nfinished school, but he got kicked out real disgraceful-like. Now\r\nBennie, he set fire to the teacher\'s chair; Joey burned down the whole\r\nschool building. But Willie, guldurn Willie, he read all the books he\r\ncould get ahold of till he knew more than the teacher: so of course,\r\nthe teacher had to kick him out to save her face. Take Willie to pull\r\na trick like that. Asked her such fool questions that she had to close\r\nthe school for a couple months to take a rest cure. That was Willie for\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nSometimes I wonder myself why Willie don\'t mean as much to me as some\r\nof the other kids do. Maybe it\'s because I wasn\'t around when Willie\r\nwas born. Just happened the draft, the war draft that is, called my\r\nnumber. That was for the second world war. 

Well anyhow they didn\'t want\r\nme. 

I guess the government didn\'t want to support my kids. Don\'t blame\r\nthem though.\r\n\r\nI go to the city and two weeks later I come back and there is Willie.\r\nHe\'s just an ordinary baby, no hair and no teeth.\r\n\r\n"Kinda homely," I says to Ma. But she doesn\'t seem to care, so I figure\r\nI don\'t care either.\r\n\r\nWillie grew up and Willie kept getting in the way. Asked all kinds of\r\nsilly questions. Sure, the others always wanted to know why the grass\r\nis green; but not Willie. Willie asks some silly question about "the\r\nrelative merits of transistor amplifiers as compared to vacuum tubes."\r\nThat ain\'t all the questions he asked. 

But you get the idea. Willie\r\nalways acted kind of big for his breeches.\r\n\r\nMa always seemed to encourage him too. Keeps saying Willie ain\'t my\r\nson. I know she\'s kidding, of course. I reckon she means sort of\r\nlike, in spirit he ain\'t my son. In that respect, I agree with her.\r\nWillie sure ain\'t my son. Some of the kids titter when Ma says that.\r\nEspecially Ellie, or was it Sue? We had another one of those "mess of\r\nillusionations" about that time. Sue kept talking about funny looking\r\nmen, with funny looking heads, wearing funny looking clothes. She said\r\nthey jumped out of a coffee saucer or something like that. Just a baby,\r\nyou know, with crazy notions. I never do pay any attention to these\r\ncrazy ideas the kids bring up. I once read a book or something, or\r\nmaybe someone told me, kids always see things that aren\'t there. Just\r\nhumor them and don\'t say nothing, so I don\'t say nothing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe had a couple more kids after Willie. Three I think it was. All nice\r\nstrong babies. I remember once Willie asked where they came from. That\r\nwas the only near normal question Willie ever asked. He found out quick\r\nenough without any help from me. Willie was like that. He found out all\r\nkinds of goofy things from Lord only knows where. Even kept telling me\r\nthat it didn\'t matter at all what time of moon I planted the crops.\r\nJust a punk kid too big for his breeches. Been farming all my life and\r\nhe\'s telling me.\r\n\r\nTo get back to the facts, we asked the folks around here if any of them\r\nhad noticed the whereabouts of Willie. Someone said they\'d seen him\r\nin the cornfield near the Weston farm. At least, what used to be the\r\nWeston farm. The same night Willie disappeared someone or something\r\nrooted and burned his whole corn patch.\r\n\r\nOn the whole most people were too interested in the lights and noises\r\nthey were seeing and hearing to pay any attention to Willie\'s getting\r\nlost. Ma missed Willie at first. He used to keep her company quite a\r\nbit. He was too scrawny to do outside work, so he used to help Ma in\r\nthe house. But soon even Ma got used to the idea. Now she don\'t mention\r\nhim no more.\r\n\r\nDon\'t know why I\'m telling you this. Maybe it\'s because you\'re new\r\naround here and I thought you might be interested.\r\n\r\nHey Ma! 

How about a fresh pot of coffee? This one\'s about gone.\r\n\r\nAbout Willie now, it might be the time of year that makes me think\r\nabout him. It\'s harvest time you know. The time Willie disappeared.\r\nHey Ma, tell those kids to cut the noise out there. Can\'t hear myself\r\nthink. Now where were we? Come to think of it, the kids are all in bed\r\nby now. Hard day harvesting.\r\n\r\nMaybe I\'d better check on the noise. Want to come along? 

Watch your\r\nhead as you go out. The stoop is kind of low. I always bang my head if\r\nI don\'t stop to think about it.\r\n\r\nHey you! What you doing in my corn? Guldurn flying saucer or no guldurn\r\nflying saucer, that guldurn thing is ruining my crop! Hey, there\'s\r\nsome people or what look like people. 

Say, they remind me of Willie,\r\nbig heads and scrawny bodies. Well, what do you know? It\'s Willie!\r\nWillie, where you been and where\'d you get that get up? Tell those\r\nthings you\'re with to get the saucer thing off my corn. Just wait till\r\nyour Ma sees you. She\'s been worried sick. 

Fine thing! Leaving us in\r\nthe middle of harvest. Hey Ma! It\'s Willie!\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


You\'re a writer but\r\nI like you anyway. I feel that the audience will get the proper impact\r\nonly if she\'s naked."\r\n\r\n"It\'ll be an impact all right."\r\n\r\n"You write the script the way I tell you. I don\'t want to argue\r\nanymore. I like you, Ronnie."\r\n\r\n"If you want a sexy script I\'ll make it sexy without being lewd."\r\n\r\n"Sexy? Don\'t be vulgar. I want a down to earth picture like the French\r\nand Italians make. I want to surpass them with my realism."\r\n\r\n"David, what good would it do if I did write the scenario your way?\r\nThe scene would never be shot."\r\n\r\n"Enough," he screamed. He clutched his chest. "I feel an attack coming\r\non. Leave me. 

Get out."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDwight Howard was chief production man at Silver Studios. He listened\r\ngravely as I spilled my heart out to him.\r\n\r\n"He\'s a great director," Dwight Howard said. He was a large man with\r\ntiny ears, liquid blue eyes, and the cigars he smoked cost a buck a\r\nstogie.\r\n\r\n"Sure," I said. "A great goofy director. He\'s nuts just like all\r\ndirectors."\r\n\r\nHe grinned at me. "Directors believe all writers are crazy and writers\r\nbelieve all directors are crazy."\r\n\r\n"You want me to write the script his way? You want that scene shot with\r\nHarriet Desmond nude?"\r\n\r\n"No, no. 

Of course not. The whole idea is too ridiculous for words." He\r\nsighed. 

"I\'ll have a talk with him."\r\n\r\nDavid Fry resigned the following day. Tortured and abused actors and\r\nactresses celebrated for three days and three nights. Dwight Howard\r\ndidn\'t have to accept the resignation as Fry was bound to Silver\r\nStudios by an iron clad contract. But a director\'s work gets sloppy if\r\nhis heart isn\'t in it. So out went David Fry, the realist.\r\n\r\nNobody in Hollywood heard from Fry in seven months. And nobody seemed\r\nto care.\r\n\r\nOne night, as I came home from a party, I was greeted by the screaming\r\nof the telephone. 

I held the receiver to my ear. "Maternity hospital,"\r\nI said.\r\n\r\n"Ronnie." It was David Fry.\r\n\r\n"Oh. Hello. 

How\'s everything?"\r\n\r\n"Fine. Great. I\'ve got to see you."\r\n\r\n"Well...."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll hop right over."\r\n\r\nHe hung up and I sighed. I built myself a solid drink and got\r\ncomfortable.\r\n\r\nHe showed up twenty minutes later. He was thinner, more nervous than\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nHe flopped on a divan. "You wouldn\'t believe it," he said.\r\n\r\n"Believe what?"\r\n\r\n"I want to do a picture. A science picture about a trip to Mars."\r\n\r\n"It\'s been done. And more than once."\r\n\r\n"With real Martians?"\r\n\r\nI blinked. "I\'ll get you a drink."\r\n\r\n"No. I want a clear head. 

Hear me out. I\'ve met them."\r\n\r\n"Who?"\r\n\r\n"Martians. A whole gang of them. Real honest to goodness Martians. It\'s\r\nfantastic. 

But it\'s true. They landed in the San Fernando Valley."\r\n\r\n"That figures."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got my home there. They asked for directions to Hollywood. You\r\nknow what? They came to revolutionize the industry."\r\n\r\n"Maybe they\'re Commies?"\r\n\r\n"You should see their equipment. Fantastic. I talked them into staying\r\nover at my place. They dismantled their ship and have it stored away. I\r\nwant you to do the screen play. 

It\'ll be great."\r\n\r\n"They... er... weren\'t detected flying over?"\r\n\r\n"They use an anti-radar beam."\r\n\r\n"Oh."\r\n\r\n"They can speak every language under the sun."\r\n\r\n"Look, David. I\'m tired and I want to go to bed. So be nice and go\r\nsober up."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t believe me?"\r\n\r\n"No. In plain language, no."\r\n\r\nHe extracted a square shaped box from a pocket. "See this gadget? I can\r\nmake myself disappear."\r\n\r\n"Do that."\r\n\r\nAnd he did.\r\n\r\n"Yow!" I screamed.\r\n\r\nHe reappeared.\r\n\r\nI staggered to the liquor cabinet and made myself a double triple\r\nwhiskey and soda.\r\n\r\n"Well?" There was a look of triumph on his face.\r\n\r\n"They give you that?"\r\n\r\n"A present."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got nothing doing for a week. I\'ll be there tomorrow morning."\r\n\r\n"No. Tonight. You\'re liable to blab about it."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you trust me?"\r\n\r\n"No. I know you went to see Dwight Howard about me."\r\n\r\n"Then why do you want me to write the story?"\r\n\r\n"I feel you owe me that. You\'re honest in some ways. Well?"\r\n\r\n"Right. I\'ll pack a grip if I\'m staying over."\r\n\r\n"Do that. 

I\'ve got my car downstairs."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDavid Fry\'s home was a Spanish-style ranch which consisted of a herd of\r\ncattle and horses.\r\n\r\nThe Martians looked like us except they had no necks and no finger or\r\ntoe nails. Their leader was a giant of a Martian with the name, Dooma.\r\nThey wore slacks and sport jackets which Fry had bought for them. They\r\nseemed pleasant enough.\r\n\r\nI got some sleep and woke that afternoon. Dooma, Fry, and myself sat in\r\nthe front room and talked over the story we were to do.\r\n\r\n"We can\'t trust anyone," Fry said, "so you and I will play the\r\nearthlings in it. We\'ll land on Mars and discover life on the planet.\r\nDooma and his crew will play the Martians. Real type casting."\r\n\r\n"What about sets?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Plenty of background on Mars," Dooma said.\r\n\r\n"What?" I exploded.\r\n\r\n"Sure," Fry said. "We\'ll go to Mars and shoot most of the picture\r\nthere. Has anyone ever done that before?"\r\n\r\n"Sure," Dooma said.\r\n\r\n"I mean anyone on earth," Fry said.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like it," I said.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll bring you back," Dooma said.\r\n\r\n"I still don\'t like it."\r\n\r\n"And we\'ll do that nude scene," Fry said. "We\'ll have a couple of\r\nMartian girls taking a bath nude."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," Dooma said. 

"That\'s out."\r\n\r\n"But why?" Fry wanted to know.\r\n\r\n"The Martian Censors. They won\'t go for it.

"\r\n\r\nI grinned. 

"There too?"\r\n\r\n"But I want to film life in the raw," Fry said.\r\n\r\nDooma shook his head. "Out of the question."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll do it my way," Fry snarled, "or we won\'t do it at all."\r\n\r\nDooma stood up. "Well if that\'s the way you feel about--"\r\n\r\n"Now wait a minute," I said. "Hold on. David, we\'ve got a great thing\r\nhere. Don\'t mess it up."\r\n\r\n"I\'m the director," Fry screamed. "Nobody is going to tell me my\r\nbusiness."\r\n\r\n"Is everybody in Hollywood like him?" Dooma asked me.\r\n\r\n"Some of them are worse."\r\n\r\n"I realize we made a grave mistake."\r\n\r\n"I made the mistake of taking you into my home," Fry shouted. "I\r\ntreated you like human beings. And this is the thanks I get."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t hear another word." Dooma turned and marched out.\r\n\r\n"Now see what you\'ve done?" I was as mad as a wet hen.\r\n\r\n"What have I done? All I wanted to do was make a great picture."\r\n\r\n"You insulted him. Why, he\'s liable to go back to Mars and talk them\r\ninto invading us."\r\n\r\n"That idiot. What does he know about making pictures?

"\r\n\r\nActivity brought me to the window. I looked out and saw the Martians\r\nputting their ship together.\r\n\r\nFry came up behind me.\r\n\r\nThe ship blasted off and the Martians went back home.\r\n\r\n"They were hammy actors anyway," Fry rationalized.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


Her feet were tucked\r\ninto orange slippers, her blonde hair was done up in a neat bun. She was\r\ndressed as the government had ordered for that week.\r\n\r\nThe man said, "You are Mrs. Christopher Nest?"\r\n\r\nThere was a trace of anxiety in her voice as she answered. "Yes. 

And you\r\nare...?"\r\n\r\n"My name is Maxwell Hanstark. As you may already know, I am the official\r\npsychiatrist for this district. My appointment will last until the end\r\nof this year."\r\n\r\nMrs. Nest invited him in. They stepped into a clean living-room. At one\r\nend was the television set, at the other end were several chairs. There\r\nwas nothing between the set and the chairs except a large grey rug\r\nwhich stretched from wall to wall. They walked to the chairs and sat\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n"Now, just what is the matter with your husband, Mrs. Nest?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Nest reached into a large bowl and absently picked up a piece of\r\nstale popcorn. She daintily placed it in her mouth and chewed\r\nthoughtfully before she answered.\r\n\r\n"I wish I knew. All he does all day long is sit in the backyard and\r\nstare at the grass. He insists that he is standing on top of a cliff."\r\n\r\nHanstark took out a small pad and a short ball-point pen. 

He wrote\r\nsomething down before he spoke again. "Is he violent? Did he get angry\r\nwhen you told him there was no cliff?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Nest was silent for a moment. 

A second piece of popcorn joined the\r\nfirst. Hanstark\'s pen was poised above the pad. 

"No. He didn\'t get\r\nviolent."\r\n\r\nHanstark wrote as he asked the next question. "Just what _was_ his\r\nreaction?"\r\n\r\n"He said _I_ must be crazy."\r\n\r\n"Were those his exact words?"\r\n\r\n"No. He said that I was"-- She thought for a moment--"loco. Yes, that\r\nwas the word."\r\n\r\n"Loco?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. He said it just like those cowboys on the television."\r\n\r\nHanstark looked puzzled. "Perhaps you had better tell me more about\r\nthis. When did he first start acting this way?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Nest glanced up at the television set, then back at Hanstark. "It\r\nwas right after Texas Week. You remember--they showed all of those old\r\ncowboy pictures."\r\n\r\nHanstark nodded.\r\n\r\n"Well, he stayed up every night watching them. Some nights he didn\'t\r\neven go to sleep. Even after the set was off, he sat in one of the\r\nchairs, just staring at the screen. This morning, when I got up, he\r\nwasn\'t in the house. I looked all over but I couldn\'t find him. I was\r\njust about ready to phone the police when I glanced out the window into\r\nthe backyard. And I saw him."\r\n\r\n"What was he doing?"\r\n\r\n"He was just sitting there in the middle of the yard, staring. I went\r\nout and tried to bring him into the house. He told me he had to watch\r\nfor someone. When I asked him what he was talking about he told me that\r\nI was crazy. That was when I phoned you, Mr. Hanstark."\r\n\r\n"A very wise move, Mrs. Nest. And would you show me where your husband\r\nis right now?"\r\n\r\nShe nodded her head and they both got up from the chairs. They walked\r\nthrough the dining-room and kitchen. On the back porch Hanstark came to\r\na halt.\r\n\r\n"You\'d better stay here, Mrs. Nest." He walked to the door and opened\r\nit.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Hanstark," Mrs. Nest called.\r\n\r\nHanstark turned and saw her standing next to the automatic washing\r\nmachine. "Yes?

"\r\n\r\n"Please be careful."\r\n\r\nHanstark smiled. "I shall be, Mrs. Nest."\r\n\r\nHe walked out the door and down three concrete steps. Looking a little\r\nto his right, he saw a man squatted on his heels. He walked up to the\r\nman. 

"You are Mr. Christopher Nest?"\r\n\r\nThe man looked up and stared for a moment at Hanstark. "Yep," he\r\nanswered. Then he turned and stared at the grass again.\r\n\r\n"And may I ask you what you are doing?"\r\n\r\nNest answered without looking up. "Guardin\' the pass."\r\n\r\nHanstark scribbled something in his notebook. "And why are you guarding\r\nthe pass?"\r\n\r\nNest rose to his feet and stared down at Hanstark. "Just what are you\r\naskin\' all of these questions for, stranger?"\r\n\r\nHanstark saw Nest was bigger than he and decided to play along for a\r\nwhile. After all, strategy ...\r\n\r\n"I\'m just interested in your welfare, Mr. Nest.

"\r\n\r\nNest shrugged his shoulders. He reached into his shirt pocket and pulled\r\nout a sack of tobacco and some paper. Holding a piece of paper in one\r\nhand, he carefully poured a little tobacco onto it. In one quick\r\nmovement he rolled the paper and tobacco into a perfect cylinder.\r\n\r\nHe put the sack of tobacco and paper back into his pocket and took out a\r\nwooden kitchen match. He scraped it to life on the sole of his shoe and\r\napplied the flame to the tip of the cigarette. He puffed it into life\r\nand threw the match away. It burned for a few moments in the moist\r\ngrass, then went out. A thin trail of smoke rose from it, and then was\r\ngone.\r\n\r\n"Why are you guarding the pass?" Hanstark asked again.\r\n\r\nNest resumed his crouch on the grass. "News is around that Dirty Dan the\r\ncattle rustler is gonna try to steal some of my cattle." He patted an\r\nimaginary holster at his side. 

"And I aim to stop him."\r\n\r\nHanstark thought for a moment. Strategy--he must use strategy ... "Mr.\r\nNest." He waited until Nest had turned to him. "Mr. 

Nest. What would you\r\nsay if I told you that there was no pass down there?"\r\n\r\n"Why shucks, pardner. I\'d say you\'d been chewin\' some loco weed."\r\n\r\n"And if I could prove it?"\r\n\r\nNest answered after a moment\'s pause. "Why then, I guess _I\'d_ be loco."\r\n\r\nHanstark thought it was going to be easy. 

"Mr. Nest, it is a well known\r\nfact that no one can walk in mid-air. Is that not true?"\r\n\r\nNest took a deep drag on his cigarette and blew the smoke out of his\r\nnostrils. "Shore."\r\n\r\n"Then if I were to walk out above your pass you\'d have to admit there is\r\nno pass."\r\n\r\n"Reckon so.

"\r\n\r\nHanstark began to walk in the direction of Nest\'s "cliff." Nest jumped\r\nto his feet and grabbed the official psychiatrist by the arm.\r\n\r\n"What\'re you tryin\' to do," Nest said angrily, "kill yourself?"\r\n\r\nHanstark shook free of his grasp. "Mr. Nest, I am not going to kill\r\nmyself. I am merely going to walk in that direction." He pointed to\r\nwhere the cliff was supposed to be. "To you it will look as if I were\r\nwalking in mid-air."\r\n\r\nNest dropped his hands to his sides. "Shucks, I don\'t care if you kill\r\nyourself. It\'s just that it\'s liable to make the cattle nervous."\r\n\r\nHanstark gave him a cold glare and began to walk. He took three paces\r\nand stopped. "You see, Mr. 

Nest. There is no cliff."\r\n\r\nNest looked at him and laughed. "You just take one more step and you\'ll\r\nfind there _is_ a cliff!"\r\n\r\nHanstark took another step--a long one. His face bore a surprised look\r\nas he disappeared beneath the grass. His screams could be heard for a\r\nmoment before he landed on the rocks below.\r\n\r\nNest walked to the edge of the cliff and looked down at the mangled\r\nbody. He took off his hat in respect. "Little feller had a lotta guts."\r\nThen he added, "Poor little feller."\r\n\r\nHe put his hat back on and looked down at the entrance to the valley. A\r\nhorse and rider appeared from behind several rocks.\r\n\r\n"Dirty Dan!" Nest exclaimed. He reached down and picked up his rifle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ January 1954.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n           Astronauts and cosmonauts! When you finally reach\r\n           Mars, please be very careful what you look like!\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the shadows of a crater-wall on Phobos, moon of Mars, Grg and Yrl\r\nwaited to greet the God.\r\n\r\nIf the God continued its present rate of approach, it would land within\r\nmoments.\r\n\r\nGrg and Yrl had journeyed all night, with their eyes on that distant\r\nglinting speck in the sky. Over cold-crusted sand dunes and jagged\r\ncrater walls they had flowed, crept, bounded, oozed, toward the spot\r\nwhere the God must land if its course held true.\r\n\r\nGrg was a Fsgh, which is the equivalent of High Priest, Yrl was a\r\nFfssgghh, or Much Higher Priest. The best wishes of their people had\r\ngone with them on their tremendous mission.\r\n\r\nNow, at the place, they trembled in every tentacle as they peered\r\nupward. The rust-red orb of Mars rode the black horizon.\r\n\r\nMars was, as Grg and Yrl had learned from their Elders and now taught\r\ntheir Youngers, the stern Seeing-All Eye of It Who Was the Universe.\r\n\r\nFrom that great Eye, a day ago, had sprung a shining Messenger, an\r\nEmissary, a God that must be coming on a purposeful visit.\r\n\r\nIt had been detected at the half-way point of its trip. But there\r\ncould be no doubt regarding its origin, its nature, its destination--\r\n\r\nFor, in the matter of form, the God was a close replica of Grg and\r\nYrl--of all the creatures of their race! It was octopidal, with sinewy\r\ndouble tentacles, and a thinking trunk, and a reproduction pouch!\r\n\r\nThe only significant difference was that the God gleamed mysteriously,\r\nas if its angular, hard-line representation of normal form were cast in\r\nshining stone. As it flew it reflected starlight--and the red glow of\r\nthe Universal Eye behind it--from its sleek surfaces.\r\n\r\nGrg and Yrl blinked their own dull-surfaced, astronomically\r\nfar-sighted, rust-red eyes at each other in supreme excitement and\r\nanticipation.\r\n\r\nWhat would the God tell them? What would it reveal? 

Would it divulge\r\nthe Cosmic Secret? Would it tell them the place and destiny of their\r\nlowly race? Had it come to punish them for not being good enough, for\r\nover-reproducing, for worshipping improperly?\r\n\r\nFrom a selfish standpoint, it might even tell them how to get rid of\r\nthe _plllnk_--a subject of constant prayer.\r\n\r\nHow smoothly it flew! While Grg and Yrl and their people could bound\r\nabout with a great agility in Phobos\' light gravity, they could not\r\n_fly_.\r\n\r\n"How wonderful it would be to fly," said Yrl.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps," said Grg, "we have been found ready to be taught!"\r\n\r\nThen Grg twitched as a _plllnk_ bit him, just under the front left\r\ndouble-tentacle. He combed the light fur there, found the _plllnk_,\r\nand shredded it, casting the pieces round-about so that no two of them\r\nmight combine to form another _plllnk_.\r\n\r\nHow wonderful it would be also if the God could tell them how to get\r\nrid of the itching, crawling, parasitic _plllnk_, whose bite, in\r\nsufficient numbers, was often fatal!...\r\n\r\nThe God began to land.\r\n\r\nIt shot red flame downward from its mouth, on the underside of its\r\ngleaming body. Red flickers and sharp-edged black shadows danced about\r\nthe two who waited below. 

They shrank back, fearful that the display\r\nmight be a disapproving communication--yet they held their ground,\r\nknowing they had lived good lives and deserved no condemnation on any\r\nscore they could imagine.\r\n\r\nThe God lowered, on its belching tongue of flame--the flame that seemed\r\na tiny part, a sliver, of the Universal Eye that Watched.\r\n\r\nStrange marks were on the side of the God\'s body. They were: 1st MARS\r\nEXPEDITION--U. S. SPACE FORCE--PLANET-TO-SATELLITE CREWBOAT NO. 2.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe last few moments of the God\'s descent were quite rapid.\r\nSimultaneously, the darting red flames seemed to lessen in intensity\r\nand length. Then, at the second of impact, they brightened again to\r\nprevious power--but too late. The impact was hard.\r\n\r\nGrg and Yrl gasped as one of the God\'s double-tentacles buckled,\r\ncrumpled, with a glinting of shiny-hard material. The flames stopped.\r\n\r\nThe God, unable to remain erect with its injury, slowly toppled. Its\r\nbody thudded silently, stirring pumice dust. It was motionless.\r\n\r\nGrg and Yrl stared at each other.\r\n\r\nWas the God fatally injured? Dying? 

Dead? (For a broken tentacle meant\r\nthat fluids would seep out, and soon the dry-death would occur.)\r\n\r\nThe God stirred.\r\n\r\nIt braced two sets of tentacles against the ground, as if trying\r\nto push itself erect. The effort was not successful. Again it\r\nwas motionless. The two double-tentacles remained outstretched,\r\nhowever--and they pointed at the shadows where Grg and Yrl waited and\r\nwatched.\r\n\r\nGrg and Yrl sighed in relief.\r\n\r\nThe God had assumed conversation-position.\r\n\r\nIt must have healed its broken tentacle--truly a God! Soon it would be\r\nas good as new; for otherwise, agony would forbid conversation.\r\n\r\nIt was ready to address them. Now.\r\n\r\nThis was the greatest moment of Grg\'s and Yrl\'s lives.\r\n\r\nThey waited for the God to speak.\r\n\r\nIt was silent.\r\n\r\nA long time passed. The God remained motionless, though in\r\nconversation-position, and silent. A _very_ long time passed.\r\n\r\nThen a tiny hole appeared in the God\'s side. 

It grew\r\nlarger--larger--and then it stopped growing larger.\r\n\r\nSomething appeared at the hole. It paused, then dropped to the surface\r\nof Phobos, where it began to crawl about.\r\n\r\nIt bore considerable resemblance to a _plllnk_, except for its\r\nshiny-wrinkled grey skin (_plllnks_ were purple.) And this thing was\r\nhuge--_Huge_. It was one-fifth the size of the God\'s body.\r\n\r\nCaught by horror, and fearing the worst, Grg and Yrl waited for the God\r\nto speak.\r\n\r\n(_Damn_, John Cotter was thinking. _That was a neat bit of sloppiness,\r\nthat landing.... Carruthers will chew me out and in again!_ Pause:\r\n_Holy cats, I hope the radio isn\'t busted, or I\'ll have a helluva wait\r\nbefore they follow up and find me!..._)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe God was dead.\r\n\r\nKilled by the giant _plllnk_--a scourge from which, evidently, even\r\nthe Gods were not spared. The huge _plllnk_, even now creeping\r\naround--wrinkle-skinned and detestable, its coloration the same as the\r\nGod\'s; the most loathsome sight imaginable ... a god-_plllnk_!\r\n\r\nGrg and Yrl moved into view, from the shadows of the crater wall.\r\nTheir thinking trunks tingled with misery, sorrow, bitter anger and\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\nThe _plllnk_ stopped, having sensed them. Then it darted for the hole\r\nit had eaten in the God.\r\n\r\nYrl moved to intercept it. The _plllnk_ changed course and headed\r\nswiftly up a sand dune. With a great bound, impelled by outrage, Yrl\r\nwas upon it.\r\n\r\nWhile Grg touched tentacles with the dead God, in reverent mourning,\r\nin terrible sorrow, in loss, in supplication, Yrl shredded the\r\ngod-_plllnk_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwo days later, a second God was detected. It silently circled Phobos\r\nfrom the Universal Eye.\r\n\r\nIt did not land. It silently circled Phobos, and then returned to the\r\nEye.\r\n\r\nWithin the day, it was back, in the company of eleven other Gods. They\r\nlanded. Joyfully, mortals went forth to meet them.\r\n\r\nIt was quite a battle while it lasted.\r\n\r\nJoy quickly ended, as the Gods died one by one, each of them showing\r\nthe holes eaten in their sides by the insatiable _plllnks_.\r\n\r\nLikewise, eventually, died all the _plllnks_, which presumably had\r\nkilled the Gods. They fought with strange white flares and crackling\r\nblue flashes, which only tickled the hides of the faithful. Then they\r\nwere shredded.\r\n\r\nReligious beliefs on Phobos underwent certain basic changes. Such as:\r\nthe Gods, or at least their Messengers, were known not to be immortal.\r\n\r\nNor were the special variety of _plllnk_ which afflicted them....\r\n\r\nOn Earth, twenty years afterward, word is anxiously awaited of the 4th\r\nMars Expedition.\r\n\r\nEND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


And then\r\nthe thoughts would vanish as that familiar tug on the line meant a\r\nstruggle was coming up. A battle between man and fish.\r\n\r\nI love deep sea fishing. I was on a vacation with nothing to do but\r\nrelax. Oh, there were women, all right. But one gets tired of women.\r\nBut not fishing.\r\n\r\nSo here I was, this bright sunny afternoon, in my motor launch, when\r\nthat tug on my line made me sit erect, and my brain became alert. You\r\nhave to think clearly. You have to know when to let out line and when\r\nto pull in line. When the fish got tired you could tell. It all comes\r\nthrough experience.\r\n\r\nFrom the pull of the line I thought I\'d hooked a sailfish.\r\n\r\nI reeled in fast, then started letting out line. But the line didn\'t\r\nget taut. It was loose. At first I thought I\'d lost it.\r\n\r\nAnd then it climbed into the launch.\r\n\r\nI got up fast and made ready to dive overboard.\r\n\r\n"Hold on, fella," it said. "Don\'t get into a panic.

"\r\n\r\nI stared at it. 

It was about four feet tall, with scales and two thick\r\nstubs that was supposed to be tails. It stood on its tails and blinked\r\nenormous eyes at me.\r\n\r\n"The creature from the black lagoon," I said.\r\n\r\n"To you I\'m a creature," he said. "To me you\'re a creature."\r\n\r\n"What kind of a fish are you?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not a fish. I\'m a Grenarian."\r\n\r\n"You mean you eat vegetables?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m from the planet Grenaria."\r\n\r\n"Look," I said. "You want this boat? Keep it. 

I\'m off for Tampa. It\'s\r\nabout time I took up drinking."\r\n\r\n"You hate me."\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t. 

Honest. I\'m just not used to these things."\r\n\r\n"It happens all the time. What you don\'t understand you hate."\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t. Honest. And where did you learn to talk?"\r\n\r\n"I learned English from a professor. He understood my plight and tried\r\nto help. He was fishing the same as you when I caught hold of his line\r\nand we met."\r\n\r\n"What happened to him?"\r\n\r\n"He went back to tell his colleagues. I never saw him again."\r\n\r\n"He\'s probably in the booby hatch," I said.\r\n\r\n"What\'s that?"\r\n\r\n"Where I\'ll be if I ever tell anyone this."\r\n\r\n"This is a cruel world," he said. "By the way my name is Hrodes."\r\n\r\n"And mine is Carol Engelholtz. Now that the formalities are over, what\r\nthe hell are you doing here?"\r\n\r\n"My orders were to make contact with this solar system. My ship is at\r\nthe bottom of the sea. I have to be near water or die. And every time I\r\ntry to make contact I\'m left alone on a craft of this sort."\r\n\r\n"You mean they jump overboard?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s exactly what I mean."\r\n\r\n"You\'re from another galaxy?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. My planet is covered with water. Your planet is the best one in\r\nthis system which has water on it. That\'s why I\'m here."\r\n\r\n"But you\'re not in water now."\r\n\r\n"My gills can still absorb it. As long as I\'m near it.

"\r\n\r\n"Well, what do you want me to do?"\r\n\r\n"I want to meet someone with responsibility."\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t be able to get anyone to come out here with a story like\r\nthat. They wouldn\'t believe me. I\'d end up with the professor."\r\n\r\n"Then take me with you."\r\n\r\n"But you wouldn\'t be near water. Wait a minute. I can leave you in the\r\ntub."\r\n\r\n"Anything. I just want to get this mission over with."\r\n\r\n"I can wrap you up in wet towels. I can drive you to my place and go\r\nbring someone back with me."\r\n\r\n"Anything. Anything. 

Just let\'s get on with it."\r\n\r\n"Why, I might be making history. I may become famous."\r\n\r\n"Will you please start this craft back to land?"\r\n\r\n"Sure thing. Just a second," I started the motor and headed for land.\r\n\r\nMe. Carol Engelholtz. A liaison between two planets. 

I never felt so\r\nexcited in my life. Why, it was more exciting than hooking a sailfish.\r\n\r\n"There\'s my lodge," I shouted, pointing at the bluff just over a rise.\r\n\r\n"You stay there alone?" Hrodes asked.\r\n\r\n"I have a cook and a housekeeper. But they won\'t bother you. You\'ll\r\nstay in the tub in my bathroom while I go fetch somebody. But who do I\r\ngo fetch?"\r\n\r\n"Anyone with responsibility. I want to get this over with."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, I know. 

Your mission." I docked the launch, soaked towels,\r\nwrapped them around Hrodes, carried him--or she--to my car, and in\r\nfifteen minutes I was home.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI left Hrodes in the tub and went back to the car. Miami was too far\r\noff. There was a small town called Chesterville a few miles away. It\r\nseemed the only place to go.\r\n\r\n"There ain\'t no F.B.I. branch here," a deputy behind a battered desk\r\nsaid. He was about sixty, with a skinny neck that was covered with\r\nhalf dollar size blotches. "Better try Miami. 

Why? What\'s the matter?\r\nFind some subversives? A lot of subversives in Florida."\r\n\r\n"No, no, nothing like that. Look, there must be a school or some kind\r\nof place for learning here."\r\n\r\n"Shore thing. We gotta school."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t there a professor teaching there, maybe?"\r\n\r\n"Nope. But we got old Mrs. 

Henshaw. Husband died about six years ago.\r\nOld bag. I think she\'s been running around lately with some tourist\r\nfrom Iowa. Now if you\'re just lookin\' for any old professor, then--"\r\n\r\n"That\'s right," I said, grasping at a straw. "Any old professor. Is\r\nthere one in town?"\r\n\r\n"Professor Klugelmeyer. Used to teach at some eastern college. Kind of\r\ndopey, though, I think. Funny old gaffer. Believes in flyin\' saucers.\r\nCan you imagine?"\r\n\r\n"Where do I reach him?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s stayin\' at Mrs. Kirpatrick\'s roomin\' house. Poor Mrs. Kirpatrick.\r\nGot a bad case of food poisoning. She ate--"\r\n\r\nI ran out of the building and inquired for the rooming house. I found\r\nit and Professor Klugelmeyer.\r\n\r\n"What? What? Hard to believe--Hard to believe. Once heard the same\r\nstory from Professor Dickson. The poor fellow was put away. You must be\r\nmistaken, old man. You must be. 

Take my advice. Give up drinking. Bad\r\nfor the liver, too, you know."\r\n\r\n"That old deputy told me you believe in flying saucers," I said.\r\n\r\n"I do. I really do. 

From Mars, probably. But they certainly won\'t turn\r\nout to be fish. Fish talking? Come now."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t believe it at first myself. Listen, Professor, come with me.\r\nSee and hear for yourself."\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know."\r\n\r\nIt took me an hour before I had him half convinced. I almost dragged\r\nhim to my car.\r\n\r\n"This had better not turn out to be a practical joke," he said. The\r\nprofessor was somewhere between sixty and seventy. He was kind of thin\r\nand he sported a long white mustache.\r\n\r\nIt was getting toward evening when we got to the lodge.\r\n\r\nI ushered him in to my room. "There," I said, flinging open the\r\nbathroom door.\r\n\r\n"Where?" he said.\r\n\r\n"There."\r\n\r\n"Where?"\r\n\r\nI looked. I blinked. 

I looked again. The tub was empty.\r\n\r\nI raced through the house.\r\n\r\nIn the front room I saw Mrs. O\'Brien, my housekeeper.\r\n\r\n"Where\'s Hrodes?" I asked her.\r\n\r\n"Who?"\r\n\r\n"He was in the tub. I left him there."\r\n\r\n"You mean that big fish?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes. Where is he?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s in the kitchen. We\'re having him for dinner."\r\n\r\n"What!"\r\n\r\n"Sure. Yat has it in the oven now."\r\n\r\n"You murderer!"\r\n\r\n"What are you talking about? It\'s only a fish. Didn\'t you catch him so\r\nwe\'d have fish for dinner?"\r\n\r\n"No. Didn\'t he tell you who he was?"\r\n\r\n"Are you crazy? He didn\'t tell me nothin\'. Besides, I didn\'t see it\r\ntill Sun Yat had it all cut up and laid out for cookin\'."\r\n\r\nSun Yat, my Chinese cook. Hrodes had met someone who couldn\'t\r\nunderstand his plight or be scared out of his wits. Sun Yat was a deaf\r\nmute!\r\n\r\nThe professor was clucking sadly at me as he stomped out of the house.\r\n\r\nMe? There was nothing to do but eat my dinner....\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


More when he goes along by\r\nhimself; less when you try to pin him down to it. And since the subject\r\nof tonight\'s revelations would be the pre-Mohammed Arabian Culture, I\'d\r\nfind Alva inclined toward my side of the debate, which is strictly\r\nmorphological and without any pious theories of "progress".\r\n\r\nI\'d completely forgotten that Jocelyn had mentioned something about\r\nhaving a special attraction: a "Mr. Fayliss", who, she insisted, was a\r\ntroubadour. I didn\'t comment, not wanting to spend a day with Jocelyn on\r\nthe phone, exploring the Provence.\r\n\r\nThe night wasn\'t too warm for August, and there were occasional gusts of\r\nair seeping through the layers of tobacco smoke that hovered over the\r\nassemblage. As usual, it was a heterogeneous crowd, which rapidly formed\r\nnumerous islands of discourse. The trade winds carried salient gems of\r\nintelligence throughout the entire archipelago at times, and Jocelyn\r\nwalked upon the water, scurrying from one body to another, sopping up\r\nthe overflow of "culture". She visited our atoll, where Kutrov\'s\r\npassionate exposition had already raised the mean temperature some\r\ndegrees, but didn\'t stay long. Such debates didn\'t suggest any course of\r\nsocial or political action, and couldn\'t be trued in to any of her\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\nMy attention was wandering from the Kutrov-Alva variations, for Bill had\r\nonly been speaking for ten minutes, and could not be expected to arrive\r\nat any point whatsoever for at least another fifteen. From the east of\r\nus came apocalyptic figures of nuclear physics; from the west, I heard\r\nthe strains of Mondrian interwoven with Picasso; south of us, a post\r\nmortem on the latest "betrayal" of this or that aspiration of "the\r\npeople", and to the north, we heard the mysteries of atonality. 

It was\r\nwhile I was looking around, and letting these things roll over me, that\r\nI saw the stranger enter. Jocelyn immediately bounced up from a couch,\r\nleaving the crucial problem of atmosphere-poisoning via fission and/or\r\nfusion bombs suspended, and made effusive noises.\r\n\r\nThis, then, was the "troubadour"--Mr. Fayliss. 

The Main Attraction was\r\ndecidedly prepossessing. Tall, peculiarly graceful both in appearance\r\nand manner, dressed with an immaculateness that seemed excessive in this\r\npost-Bohemian circle. There was a decided musical quality to his speech,\r\nas he made polite comments upon being introduced to each of us, and an\r\nexactness in sentence-structure, word-choices and enunciation that\r\nbespoke the foreigner. Jocelyn took him around with the air of\r\nconducting a quick tour through a museum, then settled him momentarily\r\nwith the music group, now in darkest Schoenberg, only partially\r\nilluminated by "Wozzek". I watched Fayliss long enough to solidify an\r\nimpression that he was at ease here--but not merely in this particular\r\ndiscussion. It was a case of his being simply at ease, period.\r\n\r\nKutrov was watching him, too, and I saw now that there would be a\r\nmost-likely permanent digression. Too bad--I\'d had a feeling that when\r\nhe came to his point, it would have been a strong one. "Hungarian, do\r\nyou suppose?" 

he asked.\r\n\r\nAlva examined the evidence. Fayliss had high cheekbones, longish eyes,\r\nwith large pupils. He was lean, without giving an impression of\r\nthinness. He had not taken off his gloves, and I wondered if he would\r\ncome forth with a monocle; if he had, it would not have seemed an\r\naffectation.\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t say Slavic," Alva said. He started off on ethnology, and we\r\ntoured the Near East again. I jumped into the break when Kutrov was\r\nswallowing beer and Alva lighting a cigaret to observe that Fayliss\r\nreminded me of some Egyptian portraits--although I couldn\'t set the\r\nperiod. "If those eyes of his don\'t shine in the dark," I added, "they\r\nought to."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA brief pause for appreciation, then Jocelyn was calling for all men\'s\r\nattention. 

She managed to get it in reasonably short order, took a deep\r\nbreath, then dived into announcing that our "special guest, Mr. Fayliss"\r\nwas going to deliver a song-cycle.\r\n\r\nFayliss arose, bowed slightly, then nodded to Mark Loring, who brought\r\nforth his oboe. "These songs were not conceived or composed in the form\r\nI am presenting them," he said. "But I believe that the arrangement I\r\nuse is an effective one.\r\n\r\n"I call this, \'Song of the Last Men\'." He nodded again to Loring, and\r\nthe performance began. 

His voice was affecting, and his artistry\r\nunmistakable. And there were overtones in his voice that gave an added\r\neeriness to the weird music itself.\r\n\r\nThe songs told of the feelings, the memories, and despair of a\r\nnearly-extinct people--one which had achieved a great culture and a\r\nworld-wide civilization. The singer knows that the civilization has been\r\ndestroyed; that the people created by this culture and civilization are\r\ngone, the few survivors being pitiful fellaheen, unable to rebuild or\r\nbring forth a culture of their own. There is despair at the loss of the\r\ncomforts the civilization they knew brought them, sorrow at their\r\ninability to share in its greatness--even in memory; and a resigned\r\ncertainty that they are the last of the race--they will soon be gone,\r\nand no others shall arise after them.\r\n\r\nThere was silence when Fayliss finished, then discreet but firm\r\napplause, as if the audience felt that giving full reign to their\r\napproval would make an impious racket. Fayliss seemed to sense this\r\nfeeling, and smiled as he bowed.\r\n\r\n"These are not songs of your people, are they?" asked Jocelyn.\r\n\r\nFayliss shook his head. "Oh no--they are far removed from us. I am\r\nmerely an explorer of past cultures and civilizations, and I enjoy\r\nadapting such masterpieces of the past as I can find. This arrangement\r\nwas made for you; I shall make a different one for my own people, so\r\nthat the sonic values of the music and the words agree with each other."\r\n\r\nKutrov blinked, then asked him--"Well, can you tell us something more\r\nabout the people who created this cycle? It has a familiar ring to it,\r\nyet I cannot tie it in with any past culture I have heard of.

"\r\n\r\nJocelyn cut in with the regretful announcement that Mr. Fayliss had\r\nanother appointment, and called for a note of thanks to him for coming.\r\nMore applause--this time unrestrained. Fayliss smiled again and swept\r\nhis eyes around us, as if filled with some amusing secret. Then he said\r\nto Kutrov, "You would find them quite understandable."\r\n\r\nI wandered over to the window, in search of air, and noted that someone\r\nhad indiscreetly left a comfortable chair vacant. I was near the door,\r\nso that I could hear Jocelyn say to Fayliss: "It was--very moving. Why,\r\nI could almost feel that you were singing about us."\r\n\r\nFayliss smiled again. 

"That is as it should be."\r\n\r\n"Of course," chimed in Loring, who\'d come up to ask Fayliss if he could\r\nhave a copy of the score, "that\'s the test of expert performance."\r\n\r\nThe lights were dimmed again by the fog of tobacco smoke, and I could\r\nsee the street quite clearly by moonlight. I decided I would watch\r\nFayliss, and see if his eyes did glow in the dark. I saw him go down the\r\nsidewalk, with that graceful stride of his, his hands in his pockets.\r\nBut I couldn\'t see his eyes at all.\r\n\r\nThen a gust of wind tugged his hat, and, for an instant I thought he\'d\r\nhave to go scrambling after it. But, quick as a rapier thrust, a tail\r\ndarted out from beneath his dress coat, caught the hat, and set it back\r\nupon his head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Future combined with Science Fiction\r\n    Stories_ September 1951.

There had been times when the Galactic\r\nHistorian had doubted whether even his renowned abilities were up to the\r\nassignment that the Galactic Board of Education had so lightly tossed\r\nhis way, times when he had thrown up his hands--all five of them--in\r\ndespair. But at last the completed manuscript lay before him on his desk\r\nwith nothing but the final reading remaining between it and publication.\r\n\r\nThe Galactic Historian repeatedly wiped his brows as he turned the\r\npages. It was a warm night, even for Mixxx Seven. Now and then, a tired\r\nbreeze struggled down from the hills and limped across the lowlands to\r\nthe Galactic University buildings. It crept into the Galactic\r\nHistorian's study via the open door and out again via the open windows,\r\nfingering the manuscript each time it passed but doing nothing\r\nwhatsoever about the temperature.\r\n\r\nThe manuscript was something more than a hammered-down history of\r\ngalactic achievement. It was the ultimate document. The two and seventy\r\nthousand jarring texts that it summarized had been systematically\r\ndestroyed, one by one, after the Galactic Historian had stripped them of\r\ntheir objective information. If an historical event was not included in\r\nthe manuscript, it failed as an event. It ceased to have reality.\r\n\r\nThe responsibility was the Galactic Historian's alone and he did not\r\ntake it lightly. But he had a lot on his minds and, of late, he hadn't\r\nbeen sleeping well. He was overworked and over-tired and over-anxious.\r\nHe hadn't seen his wives for two Mixxx months and he was worried about\r\nthem--all fifty of them.\r\n\r\nHe never should have let them take the Hub cruise in the first place.\r\nBut they'd been so enthusiastic and so eager that he simply hadn't had\r\nthe hearts to let them down. Now, despite his better judgments, he was\r\nbeginning to wonder if they might not be on the make for another\r\ncoordinator.\r\n\r\nWives trouble, on top of all his chronological trouble, was too much.\r\nThe Galactic Historian could hardly be blamed for wanting to see the\r\nlast of the manuscript, for wanting to transmit it to his publishers,\r\npotential hiatuses and all, and take the next warp for the Hub.\r\n\r\nBut he was an historian--_the_ historian, in fact--and he persisted\r\nheroically in his task, rereading stale paragraphs and checking dreary\r\ndates, going over battles and conquests and invasions and interregnums.\r\nDespite his mood and despite the heat, the manuscript probably would\r\nhave arrived at his publishers chronologically complete. So complete, in\r\nfact, that schoolteachers all over the galaxy would have gotten the\r\ntextbook they had always wanted--a concise chronicle of everything that\r\nhad ever happened since the explosion of the primeval atom, a history\r\ntextbook that no other history textbook could contradict for the simple\r\nreason that there were no other history textbooks.\r\n\r\nAs it was, they got the textbook, but it did not contain everything that\r\nhad ever happened. Not quite.\r\n\r\nTwo factors were responsible for the omission. 

The first was an\r\noversight on the part of the Galactic Historian. With so much on his\r\nminds, he had forgotten to number the pages of the manuscript.\r\n\r\nThe second factor was the breeze.\r\n\r\nThe breeze was the ultimate archfiend and there can be no question as to\r\nits motivation. Nothing short of sheer malice could have caused it\r\nsuddenly to remember its function after neglecting that function all\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nAll evening it had been tiptoeing down the hillsides and across the\r\nlowlands as though it was afraid of disturbing a single blade of grass\r\nor a single drooping leaf. And then, at the crucial moment, it huffed\r\nand puffed itself up into a little hurricane, charged down upon the\r\nGalactic University buildings and whooshed through the Galactic\r\nHistorian's study like a band of interstellar dervishes.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the Galactic Historian had begun to wipe his brows at the\r\nvery moment of the breeze's entry. While the act was not a complicated\r\none, it did consume time and monopolize attention. It is not surprising,\r\ntherefore, that he failed to witness the theft. Neither is it surprising\r\nthat he failed to notice afterwards that the page he had been checking\r\nwas gone.\r\n\r\nHe was, as previously stated, overworked, over-tired, and over-anxious\r\nand, in such a state, even a Galactic Historian can skip a whole series\r\nof words and dates and never know the difference. A hiatus of twenty\r\nthousand years is hardly noticeable anyway. Galactically speaking,\r\ntwenty thousand years is a mere wink in time.\r\n\r\nThe breeze didn't carry the page very far. It simply whisked it through\r\na convenient window, deposited it beneath a xixxix tree and then\r\nreturned to the hills to rest. But the choice of a xixxix tree is highly\r\nsignificant and substantiates the malicious nature of the breeze's act.\r\nIf it had chosen a muu or a buxx tree instead, the Galactic Historian\r\nmight have found the page in the morning when he took his constitutional\r\nthrough the university grounds.\r\n\r\nHowever, since a xixxix tree was selected, no doubt whatever can remain\r\nas to the breeze's basic motivation. Articles of a valuable nature just\r\naren't left beneath xixxix trees. 

Everybody knows that squixes live in\r\nxixxix trees and everybody knows that squixes are collectors. They\r\ncollect all sorts of things, buttons and pins and twigs and\r\npebbles--anything at all, in fact, that isn't too big for them to pick\r\nup and carry into their xixxix tree houses.\r\n\r\nThey have been called less kind things than collectors. Thieves, for\r\nexample, and scavengers. But collectors are what they really are.\r\nCollecting fulfills a basic need in their mammalian makeup; the\r\npossession of articles gives them a feeling of security. They love to\r\nsurround their little furry bodies with all sorts of odds and ends, and\r\ntheir little arboreal houses are stuffed with everything you can think\r\nof.\r\n\r\nAnd they simply adore paper. They adore it because it has a practical as\r\nwell as a cultural value.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, they adore it because it is wonderful to make hammocks out\r\nof.\r\n\r\nWhen the two squixes in the xixxix tree saw the page drift to the\r\nground, they could hardly believe their eyes. They chittered excitedly\r\nas they skittered down the trunk. The page had hardly stopped fluttering\r\nbefore it was whisked aloft again, clenched in tiny squix fingers.\r\n\r\nThe squixes wasted no time.

"Now, then! 

What\r\nseems to be the trouble?"\r\n\r\nWheatley had been palpitating for five days straight at the prospect of\r\ncoming here. "I know it\'s silly," he said. "But I\'ve been having a pain\r\nin my toe."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!" said the doctor. "Well, now! How long have you had this pain,\r\nmy man?"\r\n\r\n"About six months now, I\'d say. Just now and then, you know. It\'s never\r\nreally been bad. Until last week. You see--"\r\n\r\n"I see," said the doctor. "Getting worse all the time, you say."\r\n\r\nWheatley wiggled the painful toe reflectively. "Well--you might say\r\nthat. You see, when I first--"\r\n\r\n"How old did you say you were, Mr. Wheatley?"\r\n\r\n"Fifty-five."\r\n\r\n"Fifty-_five_!" The doctor leafed through the medical record on his\r\ndesk. "But this is incredible. You haven\'t had a checkup in almost ten\r\nyears!"\r\n\r\n"I guess I haven\'t," said Wheatley, apologetically. "I\'d been feeling\r\npretty well until--"\r\n\r\n"_Feeling_ well!" The doctor stared in horror. "But my dear fellow, no\r\ncheckup since January 1963! We aren\'t in the Middle Ages, you know. This\r\nis 1972."\r\n\r\n"Well, of course--"\r\n\r\n"Of course you may be _feeling_ well enough, but that doesn\'t mean\r\neverything is just the way it should be. And now, you see, you\'re having\r\npains in your toes!"\r\n\r\n"One toe," said Wheatley. "The little one on the right. It seemed to\r\nme--"\r\n\r\n"One toe _today_, perhaps," said the doctor heavily. "But _tomorrow_--"\r\nHe heaved a sigh. "How about your breathing lately? Been growing short\r\nof breath when you hurry upstairs?"\r\n\r\n"Well--I _have_ been bothered a little."\r\n\r\n"I thought so! Heart pound when you run for the subway? Feel tired all\r\nday? 

Pains in your calves when you walk fast?"\r\n\r\n"Uh--yes, occasionally, I--" Wheatley looked worried and rubbed his toe\r\non the chair leg.\r\n\r\n"You know that fifty-five is a dangerous age," said the doctor gravely.\r\n"Do you have a cough? Heartburn after dinner? 

Prop up on pillows at\r\nnight? 

Just as I thought! And no checkup for ten years!" He sighed\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"I suppose I should have seen to it," Wheatley admitted. "But you see,\r\nit\'s just that my toe--"\r\n\r\n"My dear fellow! Your toe is _part_ of you. It doesn\'t just exist down\r\nthere all by itself. If your _toe_ hurts, there must be a _reason_."\r\n\r\nWheatley looked more worried than ever. "There must? I thought--perhaps\r\nyou could just give me a little something--"\r\n\r\n"To stop the pain?" The doctor looked shocked. "Well, of course I could\r\n_do_ that, but that\'s not getting at the root of the trouble, is it?\r\nThat\'s just treating symptoms. Medieval quackery. Medicine has advanced\r\na long way since your last checkup, my friend. And even treatment has\r\nits dangers. Did you know that more people died last year of _aspirin_\r\npoisoning than of _cyanide_ poisoning?"\r\n\r\nWheatley wiped his forehead. "I--dear me! I never realized--"\r\n\r\n"We have to _think_ about those things," said the doctor. "Now, the\r\nproblem here is to find out _why_ you have the pain in your toe. It\r\ncould be inflammatory. Maybe a tumor. Perhaps it could be, uh,\r\nfunctional ... or maybe vascular!"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you could take my blood pressure, or something," Wheatley\r\noffered.\r\n\r\n"Well, of course I _could_. But that isn\'t really my field, you know. It\r\nwouldn\'t really _mean_ anything, if I did it. But there\'s nothing to\r\nworry about. We have a fine Hypertensive man at the Diagnostic Clinic."\r\nThe doctor checked the appointment book on his desk. "Now, if we could\r\nsee you there next Monday morning at nine--"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Very interesting X rays," said the young doctor with the red hair.\r\n"_Very_ interesting. See this shadow in the duodenal cap? 

See the\r\nprolonged emptying time? And I\'ve never seen such beautiful\r\npylorospasm!"\r\n\r\n"This is my toe?" asked Wheatley, edging toward the doctors. It seemed\r\nhe had been waiting for a very long time.\r\n\r\n"Toe! Oh, no," said the red-headed doctor. "No, that\'s the Orthopedic\r\nRadiologist\'s job. I\'m a Gastro-Intestinal man, myself. Upper. Dr.\r\nSchultz here is Lower." The red-headed doctor turned back to his\r\nconsultation with Dr. Schultz. Mr. Wheatley rubbed his toe and waited.\r\n\r\nPresently another doctor came by. He looked very grave as he sat down\r\nbeside Wheatley. "Tell me, Mr. Wheatley, have you had an orthodiagram\r\nrecently?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"An EKG?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Fluoroaortogram?"\r\n\r\n"I--don\'t _think_ so."\r\n\r\nThe doctor looked even graver, and walked away, muttering to himself. In\r\na few moments he came back with two more doctors. "--no question in _my_\r\nmind that it\'s cardiomegaly," he was saying, "but Haddonfield should\r\nknow. He\'s the best Left Ventricle man in the city. Excellent paper in\r\nthe AMA Journal last July: \'The Inadequacies of Modern Orthodiagramatic\r\nTechniques in Demonstrating Minimal Left Ventricular Hypertrophy.\' A\r\nbrilliant study, simply brilliant! Now _this_ patient--" He glanced\r\ntoward Wheatley, and his voice dropped to a mumble.\r\n\r\nPresently two of the men nodded, and one walked over to Wheatley,\r\ncautiously, as though afraid he might suddenly vanish. "Now, there\'s\r\nnothing to be worried about, Mr. Wheatley," he said. "We\'re going to\r\nhave you fixed up in just no time at all. Just a few more studies. Now,\r\nif you could see me in Valve Clinic tomorrow afternoon at three--"\r\n\r\nWheatley nodded. "Nothing serious, I hope?"\r\n\r\n"Serious? Oh, no! 

Dear me, you _mustn\'t_ worry. Everything is going to\r\nbe all right," the doctor said.\r\n\r\n"Well--I--that is, my toe is still bothering me some. It\'s not nearly as\r\nbad, but I wondered if maybe you--"\r\n\r\nDawn broke on the doctor\'s face. "Give you something for it? Well now,\r\nwe aren\'t Therapeutic men, you understand. Always best to let the expert\r\nhandle the problem in his own field." He paused, stroking his chin for a\r\nmoment. "Tell you what we\'ll do. 

Dr. Epstein is one of the finest\r\nTherapeutic men in the city. He could take care of you in a jiffy. 

We\'ll\r\nsee if we can\'t arrange an appointment with him after you\'ve seen me\r\ntomorrow."\r\n\r\nMr. Wheatley was late to Mitral Valve Clinic the next day because he had\r\ngone to Aortic Valve Clinic by mistake, but finally he found the right\r\nwaiting room. A few hours later he was being thumped, photographed, and\r\nlistened to. Substances were popped into his right arm, and withdrawn\r\nfrom his left arm as he marveled at the brilliance of modern medical\r\ntechniques. Before they were finished he had been seen by both the\r\nMitral men and the Aortic men, as well as the Great Arteries man and the\r\nPeripheral Capillary Bed man.\r\n\r\nThe Therapeutic man happened to be in Atlantic City at a convention and\r\nthe Rheumatologist was on vacation, so Wheatley was sent to Functional\r\nClinic instead. "Always have to rule out these things," the doctors\r\nagreed. 

"Wouldn\'t do much good to give you medicine if your trouble\r\nisn\'t organic, now, would it?" The Psychoneuroticist studied his sex\r\nlife, while the Psychosociologist examined his social milieu. Then they\r\nconferred for a long time.\r\n\r\nThree days later he was waiting in the hallway downstairs again. Heads\r\nmet in a huddle; words and phrases slipped out from time to time as the\r\ndiscussion grew heated.\r\n\r\n"--no doubt in my mind that it\'s a--"\r\n\r\n"But we can\'t ignore the endocrine implications, doctor--"\r\n\r\n"You\'re perfectly right there, of course. Bittenbender at the University\r\nmight be able to answer the question. No better Pituitary\r\nOsmoreceptorologist in the city--"\r\n\r\n"--a Tubular Function man should look at those kidneys first. He\'s\r\nfifty-five, you know.

"\r\n\r\n"--has anyone studied his filtration fraction?"\r\n\r\n"--might be a peripheral vascular spasticity factor--"\r\n\r\nAfter a while James Wheatley rose from the bench and slipped out the\r\ndoor, limping slightly as he went.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe room was small and dusky, with heavy Turkish drapes obscuring the\r\ndark hallway beyond. A suggestion of incense hung in the air.\r\n\r\nIn due course a gaunt, swarthy man in mustache and turban appeared\r\nthrough the curtains and bowed solemnly. "You come with a problem?" 

he\r\nasked, in a slight accent.\r\n\r\n"As a matter of fact, yes," James Wheatley said hesitantly. "You see,\r\nI\'ve been having a pain in my right little toe...."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n


That had been the last wish of each as he had\r\npassed away, dying from sheer old age. True they had fought on as long\r\nas they could to save their kind from utter extinction but the comet\r\nthat had trailed its poisoning wake across space to leave behind it,\r\nupon Earth, a noxious, lethal gas vapor, had done its work too well."\r\n\r\nNo living soul breathed upon the Earth. No one lived here now, but Kiron\r\nand his kind.\r\n\r\n"And," so thought Kiron to himself, "he might as well be a great\r\nunthinking robot able to do only one thing instead of the mental giant\r\nhe was, so obsessed had he become with the task he had set himself to\r\ndo."\r\n\r\nYet, in spite of a great loneliness and a strong fear of a final\r\nfrustration, he worked on with the others of his people, hardly stopping\r\nfor anything except the very necessities needed to keep his big body\r\nworking in perfect coordination.\r\n\r\nTirelessly he worked, for The Masters had bred, if that is the word to\r\nuse, fatigue and the need for restoration out of his race long decades\r\nago.\r\n\r\nSometimes, though, he would stop his work when the great red dying sun\r\nbegan to fade into the west and his round eyes would grow wistful as he\r\nlooked out over the great city that stretched in towering minarets and\r\nlofty spires of purest crystal blue for miles on every side. A fairy\r\ncity of rarest hue and beauty. 

A city for the Gods and the Gods were\r\ndead. Kiron felt, at such times, the great loneliness that the last\r\nMaster must have known.\r\n\r\nThey had been kind, The Masters, and Kiron knew that his people, as they\r\nwent about their eternal tasks of keeping the great city in perfect\r\nshape for The Masters who no longer needed it, must miss them as he did.\r\n\r\nNever to hear their voices ringing, never to see them again gathered in\r\ngroups to witness some game or to play amid the silver fountains and\r\nflowery gardens of the wondrous city, made him infinitely saddened. It\r\nwould always be like this, unless....\r\n\r\nBut thinking, dreaming, reminiscing would not bring it all back for\r\nthere was only one answer to still the longing: work. The others worked\r\nand did not dream, but instead kept busy tending to the thousand and one\r\ntasks The Masters had set them to do--had left them doing when the last\r\nMaster perished. He too must remember the trust they had placed in his\r\nhands and fulfill it as best he could.\r\n\r\nFrom the time the great red eye of the sun opened itself in the East\r\nuntil it disappeared in the blue haze beyond the crysolite city, Kiron\r\nlabored with his fellows. Then, at the appointed hour, the musical\r\nsignals would peal forth their sweet, sad chimes, whispering goodnight\r\nto ears that would hear them no more and all operations would halt for\r\nthe night, just as it had done when The Masters were here to supervise\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThen when morning came he would start once more trying, testing,\r\nexperimenting with his chemicals and plastics, forever following\r\nlabyrinth of knowledge, seeking for the great triumph that would make\r\nthe work of the others of some real use.\r\n\r\nHis hands molded the materials carefully, lovingly to a pattern that was\r\nset in his mind as a thing to cherish. Day by day his experiments in\r\ntheir liquid baths took form under his careful modeling. He mixed his\r\nchemicals with the same loving touch, the same careful concentration and\r\npainstaking thoroughness, studying often his notes and analysis charts.\r\n\r\nEverything must be just so lest his experiment not turn out perfectly.\r\nHe never became exasperated at a failure or a defect that proved to be\r\nthe only reward for his faithful endeavors but worked patiently on\r\ntoward a goal that he knew would ultimately be his.\r\n\r\nThen one day, as the great red sun glowed like an immense red eye\r\noverhead, Kiron stepped back to admire his handiwork. In that instant\r\nthe entire wondrous city seemed to breathe a silent prayer as he stood\r\ntransfixed by the sight before him. 

Then it went on as usual, hurrying\r\nnoiselessly about its business. The surface cars, empty though they\r\nwere, fled swiftly about supported only by the rings of magnetic force\r\nthat held them to their designated paths. The gravoships raised from the\r\ntower-dromes to speed silently into the eye of the red sun that was\r\ndying.\r\n\r\n"No one now," Kiron thought to himself as he studied his handiwork. Then\r\nhe walked unhurriedly to the cabinet in the laboratory corner and took\r\nfrom it a pair of earphones resembling those of a long forgotten radio\r\nset. Just as unhurriedly, though his mind was filled with turmoil and\r\nhis being with excitement, he walked back and connected the earphones to\r\nthe box upon his bench. The phones dangled into the liquid bath before\r\nhim as he adjusted them to suit his requirements.\r\n\r\nSlowly he checked over every step of his experiments before he went\r\nfarther. Then, as he proved them for the last time, his hand went slowly\r\nto the small knife switch upon the box at his elbow. Next he threw into\r\nconnection the larger switch upon his laboratory wall bringing into his\r\nlaboratory the broadcast power of the crysolite city.\r\n\r\nThe laboratory generators hummed softly, drowning out the quiet hum of\r\nthe city outside. As they built up, sending tiny living electrical\r\nimpulses over the wires like minute currents that come from the brain,\r\nKiron sat breathless; his eyes intent.\r\n\r\nCloser to his work he bent, watching lovingly, fearful least all might\r\nnot be quite right. Then his eyes took on a brighter light as he began\r\nto see the reaction. He knew the messages that he had sent out were\r\nbeing received and coordinated into a unit that would stir and grow into\r\nintellect.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the machine flashed its little warning red light and\r\nautomatically snapped off. Kiron twisted quickly in his seat and threw\r\nhome the final switch. This, he knew, was the ultimate test. On the\r\nresults of the flood of energy impulses that he had set in motion rested\r\nthe fulfillment of his success--_or failure_.\r\n\r\nHe watched with slight misgivings. This had never been accomplished\r\nbefore. 

How could it possibly be a success now? Even The Masters had\r\nnever quite succeeded at this final test, how could he, only a servant?\r\nYet it must work for he had no desire in life but to make it work.\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, he was on his feet, eyes wide. From the two long,\r\ncoffin-like liquid baths, there arose two perfect specimens of the _Homo\r\nsapiens_. Man and woman, they were, and they blinked their eyes in the\r\nlight of the noonday sun, raised themselves dripping from the baths of\r\ntheir creation and stepped to the floor before Kiron.\r\n\r\nThe man spoke, the woman remained silent.\r\n\r\n"I am Adam Two," he said. "Created, by you Kiron from a formula they\r\nleft, in their image. I was created to be a Master and she whom you also\r\nhave created is to be my wife. We shall mate and the race of Man shall\r\nbe reborn through us and others whom I shall help you create."\r\n\r\nThe Man halted at the last declaration he intoned and walked smilingly\r\ntoward the woman who stepped into his open arms returning his smile.\r\n\r\nKiron smiled too within his pumping heart. The words the Man had intoned\r\nhad been placed in his still pregnable mind by the tele-teach phones and\r\nrecord that the last Master had prepared before death had halted his\r\nexperiments. The actions of the Man toward the Woman, Kiron knew, was\r\ncaused by the natural constituents that went to form his chemical body\r\nand govern his humanness.\r\n\r\nHe, Kiron, had created a living man and woman. The Masters lived again\r\nbecause of him. 

They would sing and play and again people the\r\nmagnificent crysolite city because he loved them and had kept on until\r\nsuccess had been his. But then why not such a turnabout? Hadn\'t they,\r\nThe Masters, created him a superb, thinking _robot_?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\nThis etext was produced from _Comet_ July 1941.

How many saw the\r\nships?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA chorus answered him. "I see," Clayton mused. "You all agree on the\r\nbehavior. And you all think there were three--not four--not two. Three?"\r\n\r\nIt was agreed.\r\n\r\nClayton rustled the pile of newspapers. "The reports in here vary. I\r\nlearn with amazement that you gentlemen seem to have missed completely\r\nthe spurts of flame that issued from the alien ships--flame which is\r\nreported to have set a house on fire. And no one seems to have noticed\r\nthat the invaders, in descending, glided on huge black wings."\r\n\r\nCorelli blushed a fiery crimson. 

"Dr. Clayton," he protested, "we aren\'t\r\nmaking these things up for popular consumption. We\'re just telling you\r\nwhat we actually saw--that is--what--what--we--saw looked like to us."\r\n\r\nClayton nodded. 

"Of course. That is all people were doing back in 1938\r\nwhen the Martians landed in New Jersey, at the time Orson Welles\r\npresented a radio version of H. G. Wells\' \'War of the Worlds\'. Or when\r\nthe \'Flying Saucer\' craze first started. Or when Fantafilm put on their\r\nbig publicity stunt for the improved 3-D movie, \'The Outsiders\', and\r\npeople saw the aliens over Broadway and heard them address the populace\r\nin weird, booming tones.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen, I am not pleased to find students of this University\r\nengaging in such unwanted extra-curricular activity as inventing\r\ninterplanetary scares. I don\'t think Washington will be amused, either.

"\r\n\r\nCorelli clicked his heels. "Sir," he stated in dignified tones, "I\r\nresent these implications. I assume they have been directed at me. At no\r\ntime have I talked about this to reporters, or in any way engaged in\r\nwhat you accuse me of. If you want my resignation from this school, you\r\nmay have it."\r\n\r\n"Really? You think that an air of dignified innocence will undo the\r\ndamage done? I am well aware of your experiments with the _y_ wave,\r\ngentlemen--and it was on the _y_ wave that the messages came. You may be\r\ninterested to know that the number of lives lost, the property damage,\r\nthe business losses due to the panic, have not yet been fully\r\ndetermined; but it makes the hysteria following the Fantafilm hoax very\r\nsmall potatoes by comparison.\r\n\r\n"You may withdraw now, gentlemen; this affair will be discussed at\r\ngreater length later, regardless of what the FBI decides. I had hoped\r\nthat the main culprit would try to save unwitting accomplices from a\r\nmeasure of grief. 

That is all."\r\n\r\nThe seven students left Dr. Clayton\'s office in record time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nProfessor Elton rapped the table for silence. "Gentlemen," he began,\r\n"Dr. Clayton and I both extend our sincere apologies." He smiled wanly.\r\n"Of course, that does not exonerate anyone from the charge of\r\ngullibility. But Harvey Gale\'s confession has been fully confirmed by\r\nthe FBI, and you--and this University--have been cleared. The public\r\nknows now that your testimony helped lead to the facts in the case.\r\n\r\n"To me, the most interesting feature of this business is the fact that\r\nGale was able to put over this hoax, despite the fact that the public\r\nhad been taken in three times before. The Orson Welles scare rode on a\r\nwave of war-hysteria; the Flying Saucer craze followed world war; the\r\nFantafilm hoax came when the world was still in dread of sudden\r\nbombings. But the Gale Hoax--what can we call it but what is loosely\r\nknown as the continuing gullibility of human beings?\r\n\r\n"We trust that this demonstration you have just observed will help you\r\nto remember that while seeing may be believing, it\'s wise not to believe\r\nuntil it has been established just what you saw."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn his private office, Dr. 

Clayton leaned forward over his desk. Or, to\r\nbe more exact, something that looked like Dr. Clayton leaned over the\r\ndesk. The face was impassive as marble, but, from out a slit in his\r\nchest, a pair of black antennae-like feelers were vibrating into a\r\nframed picture on the wall, from which the picture had been slid aside.\r\n\r\n_"Landing safely effected. Brief panic when several Terrestrials sighted\r\nships; all clear now. Full report, containing details on latest\r\nsuccessful persuasion of Earthlings that Martians or other aliens are\r\nimaginary, will follow."_\r\n\r\nFrom the speaker beneath the desk came sounds of gasps, heavy breathing,\r\nthen shuffling footsteps. Clayton pushed the picture back into place,\r\nthen took off the skin-painted vest he wore, with the flat box on its\r\ninside. He snapped a switch on the side of his desk.\r\n\r\n"There; now they can\'t hear--if any are still hanging around."\r\n\r\nProfessor Elton looked at him bewilderedly. "I don\'t get it. After all\r\nthe risk we went to, to convince the public that there ain\'t no\r\nghosts--as the old saying goes--you arrange to have students hear you\r\ngoing into a \'report to the home planet\' act. And you use a code they\r\nall know. 

What\'s the point in undoing it?"\r\n\r\nClayton nodded. "It looks somewhat mad, doesn\'t it? 

Well ... the\r\nPsychology Team was sure of the necessity. You see, more and more humans\r\nremain unconvinced each time one of these hoaxes are exposed. The\r\nunconvinced are sure that something fiendish is going on beneath the\r\nsurface, that the authorities--all kinds from civil to scientific--are\r\nengaged in a vast cover-up. We can\'t prevent this belief; we don\'t know\r\nhow to keep it from spreading. So--the alternative is to direct it."\r\n\r\nElton nodded slowly. 

"I can see possibilities along that line--but just\r\nwhat direction was this supposed to kind of bring about?"\r\n\r\n"Why, obviously, if large-scale invasion from Mars is imminent--and this\r\nis the belief that we\'re all catering to--then it follows that the\r\ninvasion hasn\'t already taken place. The two of us, and Harvey Gale,\r\nwill disappear shortly in one way or another, and gradually public cries\r\nfor effective planetary defense will mount.\r\n\r\n"You know who will direct the defense."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Future Science Fiction_ No. 30 1956.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

"\r\n\r\nWalt Granger stomped over to the enclosure and swung a heavy boot\r\nagainst one of the two-by-fours that stood like a crooked row of\r\nsentries. "That\'s my worry," he grunted.\r\n\r\nHe had stumbled upon the whole business just two hours before, right in\r\nthe middle of his part of the geoglogic survey that was going on in the\r\nrock strewn hills and gullies known on the maps as the Millsport Range.\r\nHe had seen the ship the moment it left the ground, and a few yards\r\nfrom the burned circle of grass that was still smoldering from the\r\nrocket blast, there sat the fat little specimen of life from another\r\nworld. Granger had caught the thing by surprise and had a rope around\r\nits middle before it could scamper into the brush.\r\n\r\n"My comrades will return for me," warned the thing, its yellowish\r\neyes slowly and rhythmically protruding and withdrawing within their\r\nsockets. "They\'ll have no trouble finding you, and when they do...."\r\n\r\n"Shut up!" snapped Granger, pulling on his leather jacket. He turned\r\nto the cement fireplace and gave the embers a poke with a charred\r\nstick, looking around at the cage every few seconds as though he feared\r\nleaving his back turned for more than instant.\r\n\r\nHe looked at his watch. Eight o\'clock, and night was fast spreading a\r\nblanket of charcoal shadows over the hillsides. He\'d wait till morning\r\nto move this crazy beast to the next camp six miles away. A night trip\r\nmight entail chances he wasn\'t willing to take.\r\n\r\nAfter a couple of nervous fumbles with a match, he lit a cigarette\r\nand glanced uneasily out the one window in the rough cabin. What if\r\nthe alien, or whatever it was, wasn\'t kidding about the danger he was\r\nin? What if his buddies did decide to come back before morning with\r\nthe extermination of a human on their minds? Think of it, Granger, he\r\ntold himself laconically, you\'d be a hero! A nice, cold, dead one. 

And\r\nthey\'d never find the bunch who\'d have knocked him off. He\'d be one of\r\nthose "mysterious deaths" the papers played up.\r\n\r\n"Free me immediately!" screeched the angry captive, his head swaying\r\nlike a balloon on a stick. "You haven\'t much time left!"\r\n\r\n"You\'re a nasty tempered little imp, aren\'t you?" growled Granger as he\r\nstrode across the room and peeked curiously inside the crate.\r\n\r\n"I loathe you," growled the thing. "I have no intentions of deceiving\r\nyou. 

This whole situation is simply a matter of pure logic so far as\r\nyour plight is concerned."\r\n\r\n"You\'re forgetting," said Granger, his voice lacking a certain amount\r\nof its previous confidence, "that you\'re the one who\'s in a mess."\r\n\r\n"Only temporarily, you fool!" raved the creature, jumping frantically\r\nup and down. 

"Look!" he screamed, pointing a tiny hand toward the\r\nwindow over Granger\'s left shoulder.\r\n\r\nThe geologist gasped as he shot a quick glance in the direction of the\r\nthing\'s outstretched arm. A pale green light had turned the surrounding\r\nland and sky into an eerie dawn that extended its weird phosphorescence\r\ninto the cabin itself. And two hundred yards from the cabin, in a small\r\narea relatively clear of major obstructions, was the same ship he had\r\nseen a few hours before.\r\n\r\n"They\'re here!" shouted the alien. "Let me out!"\r\n\r\nGranger slammed shut the door and lifted a massive oak bar into iron\r\nbrackets on either side. Then he was at the window again. A hatch near\r\nthe bottom of the craft was open, but there was no sign of movement.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen he saw one of them, an exact duplicate of his captive, running\r\nfrom bush to bush about fifty feet from the ship. A few steps behind\r\nhim was another. 

Two more nearby scrambled over an immense boulder and\r\nscurried into the brush. Another five were emerging, like a patrol of\r\nmidgets, from a ravine to the north of the cabin.\r\n\r\n"Be sensible, you idiot!" snarled the thing in the crate. 

"I\'m giving\r\nyou this final chance. Unlock this contrivance, and all will be well\r\nwith you. I\'ll speak on your behalf.

"\r\n\r\n"So you can lead your buddies right back here? Sure," said Granger,\r\n"that\'s all I\'d have to do to finish myself off in a real hurry."\r\n\r\n"Do as I say!" yelled the alien. "For your own sake!

"\r\n\r\n"Look," panted Granger, "I know I was crazy to fool with you in the\r\nfirst place, but now that you\'re here and they\'re outside, you\'re\r\nstaying, see?"\r\n\r\nHe reached under the lumpy pile of cotton that served as a mattress\r\nand pulled out his .30-30 rifle. Little Boy Blue and his pop gun, he\r\nthought. He grabbed a handful of cartridges from a box under the bed\r\nand began jamming them into the magazine.\r\n\r\n"That will be of no use, my friend," droned a hollow voice behind him.\r\n\r\nGranger spun himself around just as a pane of glass in the window flew\r\nto pieces under the impact of a short, shiny gun barrel. A perfect\r\nreproduction of the face of the creature in the cage centered itself\r\nin the jagged frame of the broken window and gave him the shadow of a\r\nsmile that was closer to a victorious leer.\r\n\r\n"Put down your weapon," the newcomer ordered coldly.\r\n\r\nGet that rifle up fast, Granger commanded himself.\r\n\r\n"I repeat," said the face at the window. "Lower your weapon."\r\n\r\nThey\'ll let you have it anyway, Granger thought grimly. He slowly\r\ncurled his finger around the trigger and started to move when he was\r\njarred off his feet by a roaring blast that ripped the door from its\r\nhinges and sent it crashing against the rear wall of the cabin.\r\n\r\nOutside the ruined entrance stood a group of aliens all armed.\r\nFearfully, he looked to the window, but their leader was gone. In a\r\nsecond he appeared at the door, moved inside the cabin, and Granger\r\nautomatically stepped back, his hazy mind calculating roughly the few\r\nfeet of escape route remaining to him. In a moment he was there, his\r\nback flattened against the cabin wall.\r\n\r\nThe short creature kept coming on, its murky orbs fixed on Granger\'s\r\nwhite, drawn countenance. Then it stopped its advance.\r\n\r\n"So you have one of our people," it said in a voice that twanged like\r\npiano wire.\r\n\r\nGranger tried once in vain for his voice, then gave up. He stared over\r\nthe head of his foe at the silent assembly outside the cabin, then at\r\nthe thing in the packing crate. It was sitting there, quiet, immobile,\r\nbut intently watching the scene between the earthman and his visitor.\r\n\r\n"You are holding one of us captive," the commander remarked. "This is\r\na most unfortunate situation, indeed." The small figure stepped aside\r\nquickly and waved an arm.\r\n\r\nGranger, perspiration trickling down his face, watched a score of\r\nglistening weapons raised and pointed inside the cabin. For a second\r\nhe looked directly at the menacing horde. Then his eyes saw nothing. A\r\nblazing flash of white light burst forth from the doorway, and it was\r\nall over.\r\n\r\nGranger forced open his aching eyes and squinted in the direction of\r\nthe fiery blast, but the doorway was empty. The commander was still\r\nthere, though, walking slowly to the door.\r\n\r\nWhy am I alive? Granger asked himself incredulously. 

Or am I dead? He\r\nbumped his fist against his forehead once or twice and gave his head\r\na vigorous shake. Suddenly, he turned his gaze to the cage. But he saw\r\nnothing that resembled the rebuilt packing crate; only a mound of ashes\r\nand twisted spikes. In the center of the heap, like a fat, dwarfish\r\nking astride his fallen kingdom, was the charred, blackened shell of\r\nthe grotesque creature that had once occupied the wooden cell.\r\n\r\nThen he moved cautiously toward the door and stared, speechless, at the\r\nleader of the expedition.\r\n\r\n"We shall depart now," said the being. "Thank you for helping us."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNot much later, across the silent reaches of space, a communications\r\noperator on another planet looked up from his receiving equipment and\r\nhanded his superior a message just transmitted from a ship leaving the\r\nplanet Earth: RETURN MISSION SUCCESSFUL. DESERTER LOCATED AND EXECUTED.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


Prosecutor."\r\n\r\n"Roll in the Very Complicated Monstrous Proximilator machine,"\r\ncommanded the prosecutor. Two burly laborers, panting, rolled the\r\nmachine on its creaky casters across the court room floor to Fannie\'s\r\nhead. The machine was six feet tall, three feet wide, and twelve inches\r\ndeep; on its face were forty-three meters and an on/off switch.\r\n\r\nThe laborers plugged the machine\'s line cord into an outlet and got out\r\nof the way.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe prosecutor flipped the switch from off to on. Then he folded his\r\narms and waited until all the forty-three meters ceased their dancing\r\nand went back to zero. That done, he turned to the jury.\r\n\r\n"In this machine rests the proof of the crime charged against the\r\ndefendant," he said dramatically, patting the smooth gray side of the\r\nmachine. "This machine will tell you _all_ you need to know about the\r\nmurder. Oh, to be sure, I shall show you the corpus delicti presently;\r\nbut _why_ and _how_ this crime was committed shall be revealed only by\r\nthis machine\'s stimulation of the deceased\'s brain. _She will herself\r\nrelate who her killer was!_"\r\n\r\nThere was a shocked gasp from the jurors and the spectators in the\r\ncourt room when the prosecutor pulled back the sheet from the body,\r\nuncovering her head and chest. "The jury will note that the government\r\nhas removed her skull down to her eyebrows so that we could contact her\r\nbrain\'s recordings with the machine\'s probe. The jury will also note\r\nthe four bullet holes in the deceased\'s chest, which we intend to prove\r\nwere put there by John Bork."\r\n\r\n"I missed twice," said John Bork, nodding.\r\n\r\n"Silence!" shouted the suddenly enraged judge. "This court depends\r\nentirely on the Very Complicated Monstrous Proximilator machine for\r\nits evidence." He turned to the jury, still seething. "The jury will\r\ncompletely disregard the defendant\'s utterly uncalled-for admission.\r\nProceed, Mr. Prosecutor."\r\n\r\nThe prosecutor fastened the ground cable of the machine to Fannie\'s big\r\ntoe by means of an immense alligator clamp. Then taking the bulbous\r\nradio-frequency probe in his hand he said portentously, "Now we shall\r\nsearch for the memory-recording of Fannie Bork\'s moment of death!"\r\n\r\nHe touched her brain lightly with the probe.\r\n\r\nThose seeing it for the first time were chilled by the dead body\'s\r\nsudden animation.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Winston!" cooed dead Fannie Bork, her aims raising from the cot to\r\nembrace an invisible something. She kissed. 

"You tastes good!"\r\n\r\nThe prosecutor moved the probe.\r\n\r\n"George?" called Fannie, her slim arms searching at the side of her\r\ncot. "I didn\'t hear you leave, George." She relaxed. 

"Oh, I hope he\r\nfound his shoes."\r\n\r\n"He didn\'t though," contributed John Bork.\r\n\r\nThe prosecutor moved the probe, hurrying on by emotion-stirred quavers:\r\nAngelo, Moose, Maudie, Deacon and Quasimodo.\r\n\r\n"Speed, darlin\', what\'s your _hurry_?" asked Fannie in her plaintive,\r\nmetallic voice as she held out her hands beseechingly.\r\n\r\n"I never got to know him very well," interjected John Bork. "His visits\r\nwere all so short."\r\n\r\nThe prosecutor moved his probe.\r\n\r\n"Bork! Bork!"\r\n\r\n"Ah," said the prosecutor. "Now we are getting down to cases. I shall\r\ntry that spot again."\r\n\r\n"Bork! Bork!"\r\n\r\n"She\'s not calling for me," advised Bork. "She just had a cold that\r\nweek."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe prosecutor moved his probe. At each touch, the body broke into\r\nquaking action: Ferdinand, Frenchy, Yacob; Peyton, Rebel, Young foo\r\nYum; and John.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said the prosecutor. "Here we are now."\r\n\r\n"John!" whispered Fannie. "John, John, John! Oh, Johnny Johnson, my\r\nlove! 

_Stay_ here forever!"\r\n\r\n"Wife\'s other John," said John Bork succinctly.\r\n\r\nThe prosecutor moved his probe: Sinclair, Henrik, Sitting Duck, Oscar,\r\nKenny, and Aqueduct.\r\n\r\n"That Aqueduct is Sitting Duck\'s educated brother," confided John Bork.\r\n"Before he went to Princeton his name was Wet Duck."\r\n\r\nThe prosecutor moved his probe: Pease, Reese and Meese, Acuff, Eyolf\r\nand Beowulf; Bork! Bork!\r\n\r\n"That cough again?" muttered the prosecutor, ready to move on.\r\n\r\n"No, she\'s calling for me that time," corrected Bork.\r\n\r\n"How can you tell?"\r\n\r\n"It has more of a snarl in it than her cough has."\r\n\r\nThe prosecutor tried the spot once more.\r\n\r\n"Bork! Bork! Why are you pointing that at me, Bork? What are you going\r\nto _do_, Bork?" She held out her hands to ward him off. "Oh! 

Oh! 

Oh!\r\nOh!" Then she dropped her hands.\r\n\r\n"I missed twice," John said, nodding.\r\n\r\n"The defendant will keep his lousy confessions to himself!" shrieked\r\nthe judge. "I will not have the importance of our Very Complicated\r\nMonstrous Proximilator machine vitiated by these unwanted confessions!"\r\n\r\nBork shrugged. 

"I just wanted to clear up a couple of details, your\r\nhonor. 

I just like to be tidy."\r\n\r\n"We don\'t _need_ your help," responded the judge crushingly. "The Very\r\nComplicated Monstrous Proximilator machine tells us _all_ we want to\r\nknow." He turned to the prosecutor. 

"You may proceed."\r\n\r\n"The state rests."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBork\'s lawyer advised the court that no defense would be presented.\r\nThe prosecutor exhorted the jury that its duty was plain. The judge\r\ngave final instructions, and the jury filed out. It returned in four\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict in such a\r\ngratifyingly short space of time?" the judge asked, beaming.\r\n\r\nThe foreman arose. "We have, your honor."\r\n\r\n"Just for the record, what is your verdict?" twinkled the judge.\r\n\r\n"Not guilty, your honor."\r\n\r\nThe prosecutor jumped up. "Why, that can\'t be!" 

he shouted. "It\'s a\r\n_prima facie_ case, unrefuted and therefore patent. What else do you\r\n_need_?"\r\n\r\n"Yeah!" agreed the judge, outraged.\r\n\r\n"We need some plain, old-fashioned evidence of a crime," answered the\r\njuryman, unperturbed.\r\n\r\n"Old-fashioned?" The fuming prosecutor rejected the heresy, pushing\r\nit away from him with both hands. "This is all unscientific\r\nnow," he warned. "The Very Complicated Monstrous Proximilator\r\nmachine--especially the new model with the forty-three meters which\r\nreplaces the old thirty-nine meter machine--is the _ne plus ultra_ of\r\njustice!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, it isn\'t," dissented the foreman. "Did your evidence place\r\nthe deadly weapon in the defendant\'s hand? Did your evidence even tend\r\nto show the holes in the woman\'s chest were _made_ by a gun? She said\r\nnothing about a weapon, if you will recall. She merely said, \'Why are\r\nyou pointing that at me, Bork? What are you going to do, Bork?\'"\r\n\r\n"But he had plenty of motive," pleaded the prosecutor.\r\n\r\n"Oh, we\'ll go along with _that_," assented the foreman.\r\n\r\n"And the defendant admitted it!" pursued the prosecutor triumphantly.\r\n\r\nThe foreman shook his head. "Admissions don\'t count. The judge said so\r\nhimself."\r\n\r\n"So even though you know he\'s guilty," the prosecutor said hollowly,\r\n"you\'re going to let him go?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s right," agreed the foreman happily, and cleared his throat.\r\n"We, the jury," he pronounced, "find this fellow innocent of what he\r\ndid!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


When a man of the future wants solitude he picks a slab of\r\n    rock floating in space four light years east of Andromeda. Here is a\r\n    gentle little story about a man who sought the solitude of such a\r\n    location. And who did he take along for company? None other than\r\n    Charles the Robot._\r\n\r\n\r\nMark Rogers was a prospector, and he went to the asteroid belt looking\r\nfor radioactives and rare metals. He searched for years, never finding\r\nmuch, hopping from fragment to fragment. After a time he settled on a\r\nslab of rock half a mile thick.\r\n\r\nRogers had been born old, and he didn\'t age much past a point. His face\r\nwas white with the pallor of space, and his hands shook a little. He\r\ncalled his slab of rock Martha, after no girl he had ever known.\r\n\r\nHe made a little strike, enough to equip Martha with an air pump and a\r\nshack, a few tons of dirt and some water tanks, and a robot. Then he\r\nsettled back and watched the stars.\r\n\r\nThe robot he bought was a standard-model all-around worker, with\r\nbuilt-in memory and a thirty-word vocabulary. Mark added to that, bit\r\nby bit. He was something of a tinkerer, and he enjoyed adapting his\r\nenvironment to himself.\r\n\r\nAt first, all the robot could say was "Yes, sir," and "No, sir." He\r\ncould state simple problems: "The air pump is laboring, sir." "The corn\r\nis budding, sir." He could perform a satisfactory salutation: "Good\r\nmorning, sir."\r\n\r\nMark changed that. He eliminated the "sirs" from the robot\'s vocabulary;\r\nequality was the rule on Mark\'s hunk of rock. Then he dubbed the robot\r\nCharles, after a father he had never known.\r\n\r\nAs the years passed, the air pump began to labor a little as it\r\nconverted the oxygen in the planetoid\'s rock into a breathable\r\natmosphere. The air seeped into space, and the pump worked a little\r\nharder, supplying more.\r\n\r\nThe crops continued to grow on the tamed black dirt of the planetoid.\r\nLooking up, Mark could see the sheer blackness of the river of space,\r\nthe floating points of the stars. Around him, under him, overhead,\r\nmasses of rock drifted, and sometimes the starlight glinted from their\r\nblack sides. Occasionally, Mark caught a glimpse of Mars or Jupiter.\r\nOnce he thought he saw Earth.\r\n\r\nMark began to tape new responses into Charles. He added simple responses\r\nto cue words. When he said, "How does it look?" Charles would answer,\r\n"Oh, pretty good, I guess."\r\n\r\nAt first the answers were what Mark had been answering himself, in the\r\nlong dialogue held over the years. But, slowly, he began to build a new\r\npersonality into Charles.\r\n\r\nMark had always been suspicious and scornful of women. But for some\r\nreason he didn\'t tape the same suspicion into Charles. Charles\' outlook\r\nwas quite different.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"What do you think of girls?" Mark would ask, sitting on a packing case\r\noutside the shack, after the chores were done.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know. 

You have to find the right one." The robot would\r\nreply dutifully, repeating what had been put on its tape.\r\n\r\n"I never saw a good one yet," Mark would say.\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s not fair. Perhaps you didn\'t look long enough. 

There\'s a\r\ngirl in the world for every man."\r\n\r\n"You\'re a romantic!" 

Mark would say scornfully. The robot would pause--a\r\nbuilt-in pause--and chuckle a carefully constructed chuckle.\r\n\r\n"I dreamed of a girl named Martha once," Charles would say. "Maybe if I\r\nwould have looked, I would have found her.

"\r\n\r\nAnd then it would be bedtime. Or perhaps Mark would want more\r\nconversation. "What do you think of girls?" he would ask again, and\r\nthe discussion would follow its same course.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCharles grew old. His limbs lost their flexibility, and some of his\r\nwiring started to corrode. Mark would spend hours keeping the robot in\r\nrepair.\r\n\r\n"You\'re getting rusty," he would cackle.\r\n\r\n"You\'re not so young yourself," Charles would reply. He had an answer\r\nfor almost everything. Nothing involved, but an answer.\r\n\r\nIt was always night on Martha, but Mark broke up his time into mornings,\r\nafternoons and evenings. Their life followed a simple routine.\r\nBreakfast, from vegetables and Mark\'s canned store. Then the robot would\r\nwork in the fields, and the plants grew used to his touch. Mark would\r\nrepair the pump, check the water supply, and straighten up the\r\nimmaculate shack. Lunch, and the robot\'s chores were usually finished.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe two would sit on the packing case and watch the stars. They would\r\ntalk until supper, and sometimes late into the endless night.\r\n\r\nIn time, Mark built more complicated conversations into Charles. He\r\ncouldn\'t give the robot free choice, of course, but he managed a pretty\r\nclose approximation of it. Slowly, Charles\' personality emerged. But it\r\nwas strikingly different from Mark\'s.\r\n\r\nWhere Mark was querulous, Charles was calm. Mark was sardonic, Charles\r\nwas naive. Mark was a cynic, Charles was an idealist. Mark was often\r\nsad; Charles was forever content.\r\n\r\nAnd in time, Mark forgot he had built the answers into Charles. He\r\naccepted the robot as a friend, of about his own age. A friend of long\r\nyears\' standing.\r\n\r\n"The thing I don\'t understand," Mark would say, "is why a man like you\r\nwants to live here. I mean, it\'s all right for me. 

No one cares about\r\nme, and I never gave much of a damn about anyone. 

But why you?"\r\n\r\n"Here I have a whole world," Charles would reply, "where on Earth I had\r\nto share with billions. I have the stars, bigger and brighter than on\r\nEarth. I have all space around me, close, like still waters. And I have\r\nyou, Mark."\r\n\r\n"Now, don\'t go getting sentimental on me--"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not. Friendship counts. Love was lost long ago, Mark. The love of a\r\ngirl named Martha, whom neither of us ever met. And that\'s a pity. 

But\r\nfriendship remains, and the eternal night."\r\n\r\n"You\'re a bloody poet," Mark would say, half admiringly. "A poor poet."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTime passed unnoticed by the stars, and the air pump hissed and clanked\r\nand leaked. Mark was fixing it constantly, but the air of Martha became\r\nincreasingly rare. Although Charles labored in the fields, the crops,\r\ndeprived of sufficient air, died.\r\n\r\nMark was tired now, and barely able to crawl around, even without the\r\ngrip of gravity. He stayed in his bunk most of the time. Charles fed him\r\nas best he could, moving on rusty, creaking limbs.\r\n\r\n"What do you think of girls?"\r\n\r\n"I never saw a good one yet."\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s not fair."\r\n\r\nMark was too tired to see the end coming, and Charles wasn\'t interested.\r\nBut the end was on its way. The air pump threatened to give out\r\nmomentarily. There hadn\'t been any food for days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"But why you?" Gasping in the escaping air. Strangling.\r\n\r\n"Here I have a whole world--"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t get sentimental--"\r\n\r\n"And the love of a girl named Martha."\r\n\r\nFrom his bunk Mark saw the stars for the last time. Big, bigger than\r\never, endlessly floating in the still waters of space.\r\n\r\n"The stars ..." Mark said.\r\n\r\n"Yes?"\r\n\r\n"The sun?"\r\n\r\n"--shall shine as now."\r\n\r\n"A bloody poet."\r\n\r\n"A poor poet."\r\n\r\n"And girls?"\r\n\r\n"I dreamed of a girl named Martha once. Maybe if--"\r\n\r\n"What do you think of girls? And stars? 

And Earth?" And it was bedtime,\r\nthis time forever.\r\n\r\nCharles stood beside the body of his friend. He felt for a pulse once,\r\nand allowed the withered hand to fall. 

He walked to a corner of the\r\nshack and turned off the tired air pump.\r\n\r\nThe tape that Mark had prepared had a few cracked inches left to run. "I\r\nhope he finds his Martha," the robot croaked, and then the tape broke.\r\n\r\nHis rusted limbs would not bend, and he stood frozen, staring back at\r\nthe naked stars. Then he bowed his head.\r\n\r\n"The Lord is my shepherd," Charles said. "I shall not want. He maketh me\r\nto lie down in green pastures; he leadeth me ..."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ Oct.-Nov. 1953.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _His thin scream keened away in the distance._]\r\n\r\nHe was too late to stop them. Old Kaliz dropped his upraised arm, and\r\nat his signal the four naked under-priests flung the bound body of Gor\r\nZan over the precipice. Ortho heard his friend\'s thin scream keening\r\naway until it dwindled in the distance and the muted roar of the falls\r\nboiling at the cliff\'s bottom floated upward and drowned it.\r\n\r\nHe turned to run, but the horror of what he had seen numbed his limbs\r\nto nightmare slowness. Kaliz and the four under-priests caught him\r\nbefore he had taken a dozen steps.\r\n\r\n"You are still a neophyte," old Kaliz said gently. "You have only begun\r\nto learn, and so you cannot understand why Gor Zan had to die. 

The\r\nanswer lies there." He pointed a wrinkled hand to the Valley below.\r\n\r\nOver the heads of the four priests who squatted on the ledge outside\r\nthe priest-cave Ortho looked down into the Valley, the lush green miles\r\nof its even floor clothed in a faint rosy haze of vapor. The sun sat\r\nred upon the western wall; above the eastern rim the rising moon hung\r\nwarm and turquoise-blue, its great encircling ring pulsing like an aura\r\nof living light. Under its glow the Valley-haze turned violet and then\r\nblue, and on the heels of its rising came the faint elfin voices of the\r\nPeople, leaving their caves to play in the meadow.\r\n\r\nOrtho sat back upon his polished sitting-stone and met the\r\nhigh-priest\'s eyes defiantly.\r\n\r\n"There is no reason down there," he said sullenly. "It is only the\r\nPeople, coming out to play under the moon. You killed Gor Zan because\r\nhe was wiser than you, because he talked to the People and made clear\r\nto them things they did not understand before. You were jealous of him\r\nand you killed him lest he make your own wisdom seem small in the eyes\r\nof the People."\r\n\r\nKaliz sighed and seated himself stiffly on his own sitting-stone.\r\n\r\n"The young do not learn easily," he said. "But believe this,\r\nOrtho--your friend Gor Zan was a snare to the People and a deadly\r\nmenace to their way of life. We took him from them reluctantly and only\r\nas a last resort, before he could start the People again on the bloody\r\npath of ambition, progress and the Machine."\r\n\r\nOrtho cupped his still beardless chin in his hands and stared\r\ndisconsolately down into the blue-hazed Valley where the People played.\r\n\r\n"Empty talk," he said contemptuously. "Priest-talk--ambition, progress,\r\nthe Machine! I do not know the words. There is nothing but the Valley\r\nand the People, who have always been and who will always be. Your words\r\nhave no meaning.

"\r\n\r\n"I have taught these others," Kaliz murmured. The blue moonlight pulsed\r\nwarm across his wrinkled face, made his hooded eyes pools of reflected\r\nlight. 

"I can teach you, too. You would know these things soon, because\r\nyou are almost ready to read the Books; but I shall tell you now, that\r\nyou may not be rebellious for lack of understanding."\r\n\r\nHe pointed again, this time at the moon with its restless blue halo.\r\n\r\n"It was not always so," he said. His voice softened as his memory\r\ndrifted back across the ages. 

"Once it was yellow, pitted and airless\r\nand dead, shining only with light reflected from the sun. Men changed\r\nthat, as they changed the face of their world, by the power of their\r\nscience, which in the end defeated the aims they strove for and\r\ndestroyed them almost utterly. The handful that remained of them found\r\nhaven in the Valley and began a new civilization, which is today the\r\nPeople. This time, being wiser, they outlawed the practice of science."\r\n\r\nUnder Kaliz\' calm assurance Ortho\'s resentment dwindled, and his\r\nloathing of the high-priest gave way to bewilderment.\r\n\r\n"Science?" he repeated. 

"It is another strange word. 

I do not\r\nunderstand."\r\n\r\n"In another age Gor Zan would have been a scientist," Kaliz said. "I\r\nhave seen them with my own eyes in the ancient days, puttering in\r\ntomblike shops that shut other men away from them, denying all pleasure\r\nwhile they spent their lives improving what other scientists had\r\nalready discovered. They were never satisfied, and in the end it was\r\ntheir insatiable lust for perfection that killed them, that set the\r\nvery moon aflame and flung mankind back into the savagery from which it\r\nhad risen.\r\n\r\n"For there was a time," he went on sombrely, shifting his sitting-stone\r\nto follow Ortho\'s troubled gaze down into the blue depths of the\r\nValley, "long before my own, when men lived as simply as we, but\r\nwithout our peace and security. The world then was a savage place,\r\nfull of frightful beasts which killed men for food because they were\r\nno more than weaker animals. Men, being weak and soft, sought communal\r\nsafety in numbers and gained an advantage over the beasts because they\r\ndeveloped intelligence and logic by exchanging ideas and experiences.\r\n\r\n"They learned to use this intelligence to develop weapons which\r\neventually wiped out the dangerous beasts and made the world safe;\r\nbut they were not content with safety, and fought savagely among\r\nthemselves. Nations numbering millions of men came into being and\r\nwarred with each other, and with each war their ingenuity grew and the\r\ndeadliness of their weapons kept pace with their ingenuity."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKaliz was quiet for a moment, listening to the faint laughter of the\r\nPeople that drifted up faintly from the Valley floor.\r\n\r\n"Men were not happy then as they are now," he said. "I remember them,\r\nOrtho, because I was one of them, and by a miracle escaped the great\r\nholocaust that destroyed mankind. Men had developed a weapon whose\r\ndestructiveness was beyond the power of the mind to conceive, and it\r\nescaped control; nation after nation died in a breath, whole continents\r\nvanished under the impact of robot missiles whose explosions destroyed\r\nmatter itself. One of these, perhaps by intent, struck the moon, and\r\nits reaction under the moon\'s lighter gravity set up a conflagration\r\nwhich never went out.\r\n\r\n"Those of us who survived the holocaust were greatly changed by the\r\nradiations of the explosions, and most of us soon died. I alone, by\r\nchance, was rendered deathless. More ages have passed than I can\r\nnumber, but I live on, perhaps eternally, to see that the People do not\r\nerr and fall again into the trap which science with its Machines would\r\nplace in their way.\r\n\r\n"Gor Zan was a throwback to my own savage day, a natural scientist who\r\nbelieved nothing he was told and reasoned with a deadly logic that\r\nnothing created by nature can be perfect, but must be improved by the\r\nthought and effort of man. Today we slew him, reluctantly, because he\r\nhad taken the final irrevocable step that branded him a heretic and an\r\noutlaw.\r\n\r\n"Gor Zan made a Machine."\r\n\r\nHe stretched out a hand to Ortho and they rose together, the abashed\r\neyes of the neophyte not meeting those of the high-priest.\r\n\r\n"Come," Kaliz said, "and behold the thing with your own eyes. I have\r\nkept it intact to convince you beyond doubt of Gor Zan\'s heresy."\r\n\r\nThey went back into the priest-cave, past the long tiers of Books,\r\ncrumbling and yellow with age, to stand in awed silence over the thing\r\nGor Zan had made. Ortho stared, shivering, feeling the cold aura of\r\nunsentient, alien power that radiated from the Machine.\r\n\r\nIt was a crude affair, built upon two wooden shafts that slanted upward\r\nto end in a pair of rough handles. Across them were lashed shorter\r\nsticks that supported a woven basket. At the forward end was a thin\r\ndisc made of wooden segments, a little wooden axle running through the\r\ncenter and holding the disc upright between the joined ends of the\r\nshafts.\r\n\r\n"Gor Zan tired of making two trips to his cave with firewood and\r\nfruit," old Kaliz said sombrely, "so he created a Machine which would\r\ncarry a greater load than his shoulders would bear. In my own age the\r\nthing was called a Wheelbarrow, but the name of it is not important now\r\nbecause there will never be another.\r\n\r\n"We will destroy it now, and with its destruction we will forget what\r\nGor Zan had rediscovered, which is the first principle of the Machine\r\nthat enslaved and then destroyed mankind--the Wheel."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


From memory to memory\r\nher dream-fogged mind drifted, and to the yet-to-be. It was good to\r\nremember, and to imagine, and to see and feel and hear....\r\n\r\nShe smiled. She was Ruth Halsey, fourteen, brunette, and pretty. Earl,\r\nand Harry, and Buhl had told her she was pretty. Especially Buhl. Buhl\r\nwas her favorite date now.\r\n\r\nThe room closed around her with its familiar colors and furnishings.\r\nSometimes she would dream that she was elsewhere, unfamiliar, ugly\r\nplaces, but then she would awaken to the four long windows with their\r\ncoarse beige drapes of monk\'s cloth and the fantasies were forever\r\ndispelled.\r\n\r\nHer eyes loved the two paintings, the dark curls of the pink-and-white\r\ndoll sitting prissily atop the dresser, and the full-length mirror on\r\nthe open closet door.\r\n\r\nThe pictured design of the wallpaper, its background merging with the\r\npastel blue of the slanted ceiling.... Almost as they had blended\r\ntogether that first day when she was twelve. Yet not the same, she\r\ncorrected her thoughts, frowning. 

Sometimes, as today, the design seemed\r\nfaded and changed. The gay little bridges and the flowered, impossibly\r\nblue trees seemed to change and threaten to vanish.\r\n\r\nShe laughed over at the demurely sitting doll. Essie had been her\r\nfavorite doll when she was younger. Of course now that she was fourteen\r\nshe did not play with dolls any more. But it was permissible that she\r\nkeep her old friend neatly dressed and ever at hand as a confidant. 

She\r\nsmiled at the thought. Essie never tattled.\r\n\r\n"It must be from that polio," she told Essie, knowing all the time that\r\nshe was almost well now and needed plenty of rest and careful doses of\r\nexercise. "It makes my eyes--funny."\r\n\r\nEssie smiled back glassily and Ruth laughed. It was good to awaken and\r\nsee the thick black arms of the maple tree outside the windows. It was\r\ngood to have the cool green leaves waving at her, and see the filtered\r\ndapplings of sunshine cross and recross them.\r\n\r\nShe loved that old tree. She had played among its long horizontal\r\nbranches from childhood. Her brother, Alex, who had been killed in the\r\nNormandy Landing during World War Three, had loved the tree too. He had\r\nbuilt the railed, shingled-roofed little nest high up in the tree\'s\r\ncrotched heart where Ruth kept some of her extra-special notes and\r\njewelry and a book of poems.\r\n\r\nOne of the two paintings on the bedroom walls was of the old tree. The\r\ntree dominated the old story-and-a-half white house with the green\r\nshutters that was the Halseys\' home. Her home. Alex had painted that\r\npicture as well as the other showing the graceful loop of the river and\r\nthe roofs of the village of Thayer in the distance. Ruth had been with\r\nhim as he painted that second picture from the jutting rock ledge five\r\nhundred feet above the river.\r\n\r\n"I was just ten then, Essie," she chirped gaily. "I remember how afraid\r\nI was of the height and how Alex scolded."\r\n\r\nBut Alex was dead now and all she had to remember of him was the\r\npaintings and the photographs that Mother kept in a battered brown\r\nleather folder. For a moment the bright sunlight in her beloved maple\r\ntree\'s leaves seemed to dim and the room wavered about her. 

She wondered\r\nabout that. She must tell her father or her mother.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the polio, light touch of it or not, had hurt her eyesight.\r\nGlasses! She shuddered at the thought.\r\n\r\nThe room shimmered and blurred--and suddenly broke apart to reform into\r\nsomething.... She squinched her eyes shut to the hideous vision. And\r\nthen opened them the merest slit.\r\n\r\nNothing had changed....\r\n\r\n"MOTHER!" she cried. "Daddy!" she cried. "What has happened?"\r\n\r\nShe heard the door to--to this hideous travesty of a room opening. Her\r\neyes darted around the shrunken metal-walled shell, even the ceiling\r\ncurved overhead, and she saw two grotesque daubs taped to the walls that\r\nparodied the paintings of her dead brother Alex. The coloring was ugly\r\nand the proportions out of line. And it was not canvas but curling\r\nsheets of paper taped and painted to resemble frames!\r\n\r\nA big man, sandy-haired and with vertical wrinkles deep between piercing\r\nblue eyes, came into the room. She shrank into the bed, seeing that the\r\nsheet she tugged taut across her breast was ragged and blue.\r\n\r\n"Ruth," he said, a slow smile making his face almost handsome, "you\'re\r\nbetter. You haven\'t spoken in weeks."\r\n\r\nRuth wanted to giggle. 

As though they could keep her quiet. Daddy was\r\nalways shushing her.... But who was this big man in his dusty drab\r\ncoveralls and dropped dust mask dangling upon his chest?\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you know me, Dear? It\'s Buhl, your husband."\r\n\r\nBuhl was fifteen and only a couple of inches taller than Ruth. Of course\r\nhe had sandy hair like this man. But this man was old enough to be\r\nBuhl\'s father. This was crazy--like one of the dreams that always made\r\nher unhappy.\r\n\r\nSo? 

So it was a dream. She felt warmth and release. Why not see what\r\nthis dream had to offer that might be amusing to remember and tell Buhl\r\nsometime soon. Wouldn\'t he laugh when he heard she had dreamed about\r\nhim? And been married to him.\r\n\r\nShe saw the strip of shiny metal that masqueraded as her mirror, and\r\nwhere her four long windows, with their thick, loose-woven drapes, had\r\nbeen there were only four taped strips of paper with crude pictures of\r\ndraped windows daubed on them. There were even green dabs of paint and\r\nblack splashes to stimulate her beloved maple tree.\r\n\r\n"Ruth! Do you feel better now? 

Please don\'t smile at me like that. I\r\nknow you loved the baby, but this Martian atmosphere is tough even for\r\nmen. It wasn\'t your fault."\r\n\r\n"Go ahead and talk," Ruth laughed gaily. "This is just another bad dream\r\nand I know it. I\'ll wake up in a little while and be back in my cool old\r\nroom."\r\n\r\n"Blast your room and your dreams!"\r\n\r\nThe man went across the room in a swift rush and tore down one of the\r\nfalse windows, the painted strip of paper. And beyond, through a dusty\r\noval glass window, Ruth could see a reddish brown wasteland, where dust\r\nclouds spun and shifted slowly, and a dusty huddle of what looked like\r\nquonset huts or storage sheds of metal.\r\n\r\n"That is reality, Ruth. You must face it. This pretense, this sleazy\r\nimitation of your old room is wrong. You\'re strong enough, and I love\r\nyou--you can accept truth."\r\n\r\nHis face changed, all expression sponged from it in an instant as he\r\nlooked into her eyes, and then it seemed to dissolve into something ugly\r\nand yet childish. She saw tears burst through and furrow the dust on his\r\ncheeks.\r\n\r\n"Dear Lord," he cried, almost reverently, "must this go on forever? 

Will\r\nshe ever come back to me?"\r\n\r\nHis voice choked off and he stumbled across the room and out the door.\r\nShe heard it shut behind him, and she was hunting for Essie, already\r\nhaving forgotten the ill-mannered intruder.\r\n\r\nThere was no Essie, only a mannikin of cloth-stuffed white nylon and\r\nlipstick, with black nylon for hair.\r\n\r\nAnd then the room shimmered and broke apart and reformed and she was\r\nback in her bed with the sun on the slowly dancing green leaves outside\r\nthe four long windows. Essie was smiling down at her from the dresser,\r\nand the paintings were as always, soft colors and perfectly drafted.\r\n\r\nHad she thought there were four windows? How silly of her. 

The second\r\nfrom the right was a small oval of glass, or rather, a glass-covered\r\npicture of desert scene. Odd that she had forgotten about that picture.\r\nOh well, what did it matter.\r\n\r\nIn a few days she would be well enough again to climb out on the giant\r\nlimbs and into the tree nest that her brother, Alex, had built. And the\r\nboys would come to see her and take her to the drugstore for sodas and\r\nsundaes.\r\n\r\nYes, she was sure now. She _did_ like Buhl Austin best....\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ December 1957.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

And I liked to drink....\r\n\r\n"Problem of killing grandparents before parents were born," I said,\r\npouring myself another. "Question if you can be born after that.\r\nQuestion if you can\'t be born, how did you do it? Not really possible,\r\nPangborn. 

You can\'t test it." I made a mental note to bring up the\r\nlow quality of Faculty Club whiskey at the next business meeting. It\r\nhad everything else a good faculty club should have: brown leather\r\narmchairs, old magazines, fresh newspapers, a dusty chess board, cut\r\nglass decanters ... it was a place well suited for comfortable reading,\r\ntalking and drinking--except for the quality of the whiskey.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t kill grandpa," Doctor Randall said, from far down in his\r\ncomfortable chair. "No such thing as time travel."\r\n\r\n"You underestimate the Physics department," Pangborn told us coldly.\r\n"In spite of heavy losses to our staff--last year\'s treason trials\r\ncost us three of our most brilliant young men--we\'ve made some\r\nvery remarkable strides. We have what is crudely termed a time\r\nmachine--although the correct term is temporal transducer. In fact we\r\nare currently conducting some very interesting researches with it."\r\n\r\n"Then you have tried the killing of a grandfather, Herr Doctor?" Von\r\nJuntz inquired. "You have found why it cannot be done, yes?"\r\n\r\n"We have not yet gotten around to such minor matters," Pangborn\r\nsaid. "But in time...." He began to look interested, "Ah ... wait a\r\nminute.... In practice that would be.... Whose grandfather should we\r\nchoose?" His eyes glittered. "There is always the question of risk, of\r\ncourse, but it would be difficult for the law to legally consider it as\r\nactually murder. My grandfather is already dead." He hesitated. 

"There\r\nis the possibility of disappearing."\r\n\r\n"But," Von Juntz reminded him, "by your own statement you said it, that\r\nthere is no paradox, and no risk. Grandpa would be dead, you would be\r\nalive, and there is no paradox, yes?"\r\n\r\n"Q. E. 

D." Pangborn snapped. "Reduction ad absorbum."\r\n\r\n"Et pons asinorum," Von Juntz snapped back, his beard bristling.\r\n\r\nThese exchanges would have been ever so much better if any of us had\r\never taken Latin. But I could see that Pangborn was ruffled.\r\n\r\n"Very well." He bit off the words. 

"We\'ll do it."\r\n\r\n"Whose grandfather?" asked Doctor Randall.\r\n\r\nPangborn\'s eyes glittered. "Mine, naturally. I wouldn\'t want to\r\nendanger any of you gentlemen. After all, it is my demonstration. I\r\nremember my grandfather jabbing me in the belly with a great horny\r\nfinger when I was too young to defend myself. Giddygiddy, he used to\r\nsay, the old buzzard. Died naturally. Apoplexy with a fan dancer it\r\nwas, in a hotel room at the age of ninety-three. Disgraceful. 

Nobody\r\never shot him. Don\'t understand why not. 

Long overdue." Pangborn rubbed\r\nhis hands together and started for the door. "How about it? Will you\r\ngentlemen accompany me to the Physics department?"\r\n\r\n[illus]\r\n\r\nOn the way over Randall nudged me and spoke out of the side of his\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n"Three to one Pangborn vanishes."\r\n\r\nIt seemed like good odds. If Pangborn managed to prevent his father\r\nfrom being born, logically he should prevent himself from being born.\r\nBut I couldn\'t visualize him vanishing. Common sense was against it.\r\n"I\'ll cover that." I gave Randall three dollars.\r\n\r\nIf Pangborn did not vanish, Randall would owe me nine. If Pangborn did\r\nnot vanish I would be disappointed, and money would be some consolation.\r\n\r\nPangborn passed us through the security guards and into the Physics\r\nlaboratories. No need to describe the temporal transducer, it looked\r\nlike the usual thing in gadgets--coils, tubes, pipes, condensers,\r\nwires, tubes--with a little screen overhead that lets the operator,\r\nwho stays behind, watch what is happening to his passenger. Pangborn\r\nwas extremely proud of it. He showed us all over the machine, pointing\r\nand naming every part. Von Juntz got his beard caught in a control\r\nwheel.\r\n\r\nThat made Pangborn almost good-natured.\r\n\r\nThen he wanted to choose someone to operate the machine for him. He\r\nsaid my hands shook too much, and Von Juntz would not allow his beard\r\nto get within five feet of the controls, so we steadied Doctor Randall\r\nagainst a safety railing and instructed him how to operate the machine.\r\nPangborn set the dials.\r\n\r\n"There\'s one place where I\'m certain to find Grandfather any time\r\nbetween 1893 and 1906," Pangborn told us. "The Andrew Jackson Saloon\r\nBar on Decatur Street. He spent a lot of time there. Used it for his\r\noffice they tell me. He was a lawyer. I\'ve set the machine for there,\r\nfor the month of September 1896. A good month to die in. 

Ha!" Pangborn\r\nostentatiously checked the cylinders of a huge antique revolver.\r\n\r\n"Forty-five caliber," Pangborn said grimly. "Poke me, will he? 

Ha!"\r\n\r\nAnd he climbed into the machine.\r\n\r\nAll of us crowded around the screen, Von Juntz carefully holding his\r\nbeard. We saw the picture forming, the cut glass and bright gas lamps\r\nand polished wood of the Saloon Bar.\r\n\r\n"_Four_ to one Pangborn vanishes," Randall said suddenly, "Any takers,\r\nspeak now."\r\n\r\nI reached for my wallet.\r\n\r\nVon Juntz said, "If he vanishes, it will be because he was never born.\r\nAnd if he was never born, you won\'t remember taking bets on him."\r\n\r\n"Here," I said hastily to Randall, "I gave you some already. I\'ll hold\r\nmy money, hand it back."\r\n\r\nRandall withdrew a little. "Don\'t you trust me?" he asked in a hurt\r\ntone. "I\'ll pay you if he doesn\'t vanish."\r\n\r\n"Shhh," Von Juntz said. We crowded around the screen again.\r\n\r\nThe screen looked down on the bar from above and behind it, like\r\nlooking in through a window set above the mirror. And at the bar was\r\nonly one solitary customer, a tall lean man in a frock coat and plug\r\nhat with a cigar from which smoke curled richly, and a schooner of\r\nbeer before him. He looked up at the bar mirror, and we saw a lean,\r\nevilly humorous face with the Pangborn features clearly marked on it.\r\n"Grandpa," Von Juntz whispered.\r\n\r\nIn a dark angle of the place, Pangborn himself materialized from the\r\nmachine. We saw a glimmer as he raised the gun.\r\n\r\n"See," Von Juntz whispered. "He has forgotten to uncock the safety. Now\r\nhe has. Now he creeps closer. Soon now we shall know the paradox."\r\n\r\nGrandpa Pangborn had put down his cigar. His hand had slid under the\r\nlapel of his frock coat. Just before he whirled, I realized that he had\r\nbeen watching Pangborn in the mirror all the time.\r\n\r\nHe whirled, his hand whipped out from beneath his lapel, and the sound\r\nof a gunshot echoed in the saloon. We had a clear view of the angry\r\nsurprise on Pangborn\'s face before he toppled nose down into the\r\nsawdust. He was quite obviously dead.\r\n\r\n"Whippersnapper," Grandpa Pangborn muttered. He holstered his gun and\r\nlooked up, and his lean face oddly seemed to be looking straight into\r\nthe peering eye of the time viewer, and into our staring eyes. We could\r\nnot be seen.... Or could we?\r\n\r\nLooking at us, he spoke.\r\n\r\n"Figure that one out!" said Grandpa Pangborn. I cut the switch, and the\r\nviewer went black.\r\n\r\nThe way I see it, Pangborn vanished, but not in the right way, so\r\nRandall owes me nine dollars. But he says he won the bet, and he won\'t\r\neven give me back the three I handed him before Pangborn got into that\r\nfool machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\nThat morning, the sun rose bright and clear over the Tower. Jon woke,\r\nclambered to his feet, and rolled his sleeping-blanket. Within five\r\nminutes, he was fully awake and ready to protect the Tower against its\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nHe took his station and stared out over the sea. Far in the distance,\r\nhe could make out the bomb-blackened city; off to the left was the\r\nspot of green that indicated the village of the Free People. Somewhere\r\nbeyond were the lands of the Wild Ones--the ones Jon was here to defend\r\nthe tower against.\r\n\r\n"All well to the East!" he cried, when his turn came. The other\r\nGuardsmen, stationed in a circle around the Tower, called off their\r\nobservations in turn.\r\n\r\nThe morning passed slowly. A little before noon, the man at the top of\r\nthe Tower cried, "Enemy boat approaching! Prepare to defend the Tower!"\r\n\r\nJon\'s mouth tightened, and he squinted toward the dot of light on the\r\nsea that was the boat of the Wild Ones. Slowly, he drew his sword,\r\nwhisked it through the air a few times, loosened his wrist. It was the\r\nfirst time in over a month that he had been called upon to do battle in\r\nthe name of the Tower.\r\n\r\nFrom within the Tower, the auxiliary guard-force came running out and\r\ntook battle-stations. They stood ready, waiting for the Wild Ones to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNo one knew what the Tower was. It had been there as long as any of the\r\nFree People could remember, and probably had been there forever. It was\r\nsacred to them, and for that reason was under constant attack by their\r\nenemies from the Wild Places.\r\n\r\nAt twenty-three, Jon had been a Tower guard for nearly three years, had\r\ntaken part in almost twenty defenses. The Wild Ones had practically\r\ncaptured the Tower twice, but each time the guardians had driven them\r\noff.\r\n\r\nNow, they were back for another try. Jon waited tensely as they drew\r\nnear.\r\n\r\nTime passed slowly. Five minutes, ten, while the enemy attacking-party\r\napproached. The look-out at the top of the Tower sang out periodically,\r\nkeeping the guards below informed of the boat\'s progress.\r\n\r\nFinally: "They\'re here! Prepare to defend the Tower!"\r\n\r\nThe great sailing-ship pulled up on the shore, and men began to pour\r\nforth--ten, twenty, thirty men. It was a good-sized army. And Jon\r\ngasped when he saw who led them.\r\n\r\nHe was a giant, topping seven feet by several inches. His sword\r\nglittered in the sunlight as he slashed it savagely through the air,\r\nand his hair was a coarse, matted mane. He growled some barbaric\r\ncommand and the Wild Ones charged onward. The ring of defenders\r\ntightened and stood firm, waiting for the attack.\r\n\r\nSwords rang. Jon found himself opposing a brawny youth with fierce,\r\nwidely-set eyes and a good sword-hand. He parried a two-handed chop\r\nthat could have cut him in half, and smashed back with a quick lunge\r\nthat drew blood.\r\n\r\n"Dog!" The Wild One flicked blood from the flesh wound and drove\r\nforward. Jon parried again, drove in, crashed his sword off the\r\nother\'s hilt. His hand numbed, the Wild One dropped his sword. Without\r\nhesitating, Jon cut the unarmed man down and turned to seek his next\r\nopponent.\r\n\r\nHe glanced over and saw Len, the Tower Captain, in tight combat with a\r\ngigantic Wild One. The giant was driving Len back toward the sea with\r\nsweeping swings of his huge broadsword.\r\n\r\nJon turned and started to go to Len\'s assistance when another barbarian\r\ninterposed himself. Jon whirled and leaped forward for the battle, just\r\nas he saw Len fall to the giant\'s sword.\r\n\r\n"Give back! Give back!" 

someone yelled. 

"They\'re beating us!"\r\n\r\n_They\'re not beating me_, Jon thought fiercely, as he laid open his\r\nopponent\'s arm with a savage slash and followed immediately with a\r\nquick swipe that ripped open the Wild One\'s throat.\r\n\r\nBreathing hard, now, Jon turned to look for his next opponent. He had\r\nbut one thought: the Tower must be defended. The Tower was sacred to\r\nthe Free People; the Tower must be defended.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe found himself embroiled in another duel quickly enough. The\r\nbarbarians seemed to be all over the place, cutting and slashing with\r\ntheir wild, untrained manner. A quick glance around told Jon that the\r\nTower guards were being driven back; half a dozen of his childhood\r\nfriends lay slain near him, and a river of blood trickled slowly\r\nthrough the grass.\r\n\r\nThe barbarians were falling too--but their giant leader was\r\nindomitable, was wreaking death right and left in the ranks of the\r\nGuardians.\r\n\r\nJon killed his opponent and looked around. The thick of the battle was\r\non the other side of the Tower, he saw. It was now nearly noon, and the\r\nsun blazed brightly off the Tower\'s metal sides.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached the other side of the Tower, he was surprised to see\r\nthat barely half a dozen guards remained alive. Half a dozen, out of\r\nnearly forty.\r\n\r\nHe plunged into the fray with furious energy, cutting down three\r\nWild Ones before they realized he was there. 

That narrowed the odds\r\nconsiderably.\r\n\r\nOnly three of the Free People remained--and four of the Wild Ones. It\r\nhad been a bloody, fierce battle, with heavy loss of life on both sides.\r\n\r\nJon\'s sword plunged into a barbarian\'s throat, and in that instant the\r\ngiant\'s weapon cut the life from the man at Jon\'s side. Two against\r\nthree, now.\r\n\r\n"Now!" Jon yelled and drove down against one of the remaining Wild\r\nOnes. His slash ripped open the man\'s leg, but before Jon could apply\r\nthe finishing touch one of the other barbarians killed his man and\r\nlunged at Jon, who parried and dropped the man with a swift chop.\r\n\r\nThe realization hit him suddenly: _I\'m all alone._\r\n\r\nAnd the gigantic Wild One was moving slowly toward him to finish off\r\nthe last of the Tower guards.\r\n\r\nJon set his lips grimly. So the Tower would fall, after all, to the\r\nbarbarians? _Not lightly_, he thought, and waited for the giant\'s\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\nThe sword the giant swung was nearly four feet long. It cut a sizzling\r\nswath through the air as he approached.\r\n\r\nJon moved back, up against the comforting bulk of the Tower itself, and\r\nprepared to defend the Tower to the death. The giant charged.\r\n\r\nJon parried his wild blow, felt the stinging shock ripple up his arm as\r\ntheir swords clanged together. He initiated an assault of his own, but\r\nthe Wild One laughed derisively and parried as if he were fighting a\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n"Ho, Free One! The Tower is ours!"\r\n\r\n"Not yet," Jon said. "Not while I live!"\r\n\r\n"How long will that be?" the giant asked. "Another minute perhaps?"\r\n\r\nHis sword spun through the air in a shining arc. Jon parried\r\ndesperately, but the force of the blow was too great for him and his\r\nsword went flying out of his numbed hands. He stood there, helpless,\r\nwhile the giant raised his sword for the final blow.\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly six inches of bright steel protruded from the giant\'s\r\nchest. A red fountain of blood bubbled forth. The giant stared in\r\namazement for a second, then began to topple like a felled oak.\r\n\r\nAstonished, Jon looked up and saw the Wild One he had wounded standing\r\nthere, holding a bloody sword.\r\n\r\n"You ... killed him!" Jon said uncomprehendingly. 

"Why?"\r\n\r\nThe Wild One shook his head uncertainly. "I don\'t know," he said. "I--I\r\nsuddenly realized he had to die."\r\n\r\nExhausted, Jon leaned against the Tower to support himself, and shook\r\nhis head. "Why did you save me? The Tower was yours. Why?

"\r\n\r\n"I think I understand," the Wild One said slowly. He threw his sword\r\nto the ground. 

"It is something I have long thought of. We fight\r\nyou because we hate you--because we envy your free life. You have\r\nsomething to fight for, in this Tower. I--I want to join you. 

I want to\r\njoin the Free People!"\r\n\r\nJon smiled. "You\'re welcome to come to our village with me," he said.\r\n"We believe in freedom--the way the Old Ones did."\r\n\r\n"And the Tower? 

What is its meaning?"\r\n\r\nJon shrugged. "That we do not know, but we defend it because we think\r\nit is sacred to us--to freedom. An old legend, perhaps." He clapped the\r\nother on the back. 

"Come, friend. Let\'s signal the mainland that the\r\nbattle is over and the Tower still in free hands."\r\n\r\nHe glanced up at the massive Tower, at the huge statue of the woman\r\nwith her hand outraised, stretching a torch out over the harbor. "I\r\nsuppose we\'ll never know what the Tower really was, to the Ancients.\r\nBut to us--to us, it\'s a symbol of liberty."\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


Why not?"\r\n\r\n"It can\'t be done," the big man stated simply. "Maybe sometime in the\r\nfuture, but certainly not now."\r\n\r\nSaunders stretched a bony hand out from the cuff of his tweeds. "It\r\ncan be done," he said, slapping that hand on the table. "It\'s all\r\nhere. You\'ve just seen it; you\'ve studied it. Damn it, this isn\'t a\r\nfly-by-night affair! I\'ve worked on these plans for more than eight\r\nyears. 

I _know_ it will work."\r\n\r\nA man in blue serge shrugged and said, "I\'m afraid Bragg is right,\r\nDr. Saunders." He tugged at his collar, the fat hanging in loose folds\r\naround his neck.\r\n\r\nSaunders turned to eye the newcomer. "You agree?" 

he asked defiantly.\r\n"Even after studying my work? You agree that my proposed rocket\r\ncouldn\'t possibly reach the Moon?"\r\n\r\n"It might," the man in blue serge admitted, "but we can\'t speculate\r\non a thing of this nature. After all, Dr. Saunders, there\'ll be money\r\ninvolved and...."\r\n\r\n"Money!" Saunders snorted in disgust. "Is that all you\'re worried\r\nabout? You\'re one of the richest men on Earth, Mr. Peterson. How can\r\nyou let money stand in the way of what may well be man\'s greatest\r\nachievement?"\r\n\r\nBragg spoke again, peering from behind the thick lenses of his\r\neyeglasses. "Peterson is right; this thing would cost millions--more\r\nthan any of us would be willing to risk. We appreciate your considering\r\nus, but...."\r\n\r\nSaunders cut in sharply, "Does that go for all of you? 

Is Mr. Bragg\r\nspeaking for all of you?"\r\n\r\nA heavy silence crowded into the room. Saunders confronted Peterson\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"He speaks for me," Peterson said.\r\n\r\n"And you, Mr. Thorpe?" Saunders asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, I\'m inclined to agree," a balding man in glen plaid\r\nannounced.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Slade?" Saunders turned to a weasel-like man dressed in solemn\r\nblack.\r\n\r\nSlade nodded, his face chalky white against the black of his garb.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve asked you four men because you were probably the richest men\r\non Earth. I\'ve asked you because I thought perhaps you would see the\r\nsignificance of such a project. To reach the Moon." Saunders\' eyes\r\ngleamed with an intense light. "To reach the Moon."\r\n\r\n"And when we reach it?" Peterson asked. "Then what?"\r\n\r\n"Unlimited space," Saunders answered with feeling. "New worlds, worlds\r\nbeyond the imagination of man. The Moon is only the first step, the\r\nexperimental step. From there, Mars ... or Venus ... or a new solar\r\nsystem."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBragg said, "Rubbish. Even if this should work--I\'m not at all\r\nconvinced it will, but even if it should--what\'s on the Moon for us?\r\nBare crags and lonely craters. Cold, bleak atmosphere. 

Nothing."\r\n\r\n"Nothing that would bring in money, true," Saunders said. "But look at\r\nCopernicus and Galileo. Look at Pasteur and Edison and Curie. Look\r\nat ... oh, I could go on all night. What these men contributed to\r\nmankind can never be measured in terms of gold or silver. Can\'t you see\r\nthat?

"\r\n\r\n"Who wants to go to the Moon, anyway?" Thorpe asked, passing a hand\r\nover his bald head. "We\'ve got troubles of our own right here on\r\nEarth. Plenty to settle right here, man. Plenty. In a little while\r\nperhaps. Sometime in the future. Twenty, twenty-five years. But now,\r\nunthinkable."\r\n\r\n"We\'ve been saying that too long," Saunders snapped. "Now is the time!\r\nNot twenty or twenty-five years from now, but _right_ now! Science has\r\ngiven us the means; it\'s up to us to take the opportunity and use it."\r\n\r\n"It couldn\'t be done profitably," Peterson said drily.\r\n\r\n"Profitably," Saunders said bitterly. "Are your wars profitable?" he\r\nsuddenly shouted, bringing his bony fist crashing to the table top.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s not get violent," Slade said. It was the first thing he\'d said\r\nall night. Saunders somehow had the feeling that a corpse had spoken.\r\n\r\n"Exactly," he said, "Let\'s not get violent; let\'s spend some of the\r\nmoney that\'s been buying munitions and lives. Instead of razing cities\r\nto the ground, let\'s go up into the skies. Let\'s spend that money for\r\na project that\'s worthwhile. For once, forget the profit and think of\r\nthe meaning to mankind." He paused and his voice grew lower. "We\'ve\r\nbeen ravaged by too many wars, gentleman. Can\'t we stop this useless\r\nbutchery and devote our time and energy to something constructive?\r\nCan\'t we? I know my rocket will work. It\'s scientifically sound. I\r\nknow, too, that I can get a crew of scientists and technicians to take\r\nit to the Moon and back. All I need is the money and a little time.\r\nJust a little time."\r\n\r\n"There\'s a war going on, Saunders," Bragg reminded him. He had lit\r\na cigar with a gold lighter and was sitting now, puffing leisurely,\r\nblowing smoke at the ceiling.\r\n\r\n"I know," Saunders said. "Two wars in the past thirty years and now\r\nanother one. 

But consider this a moment. A trip to the Moon would\r\nprobably end all hostilities on Earth. It would probably unify this\r\nplanet as no other force has ever done. It will galvanize humanity into\r\nconstructive action. It will open new vistas that cannot possibly admit\r\nplans for war."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPeterson yawned openly. 

"Mmmm. I must say you\'re an idealist, Saunders.\r\nI doubt very much if anything short of a trip to the Sun would unify\r\nthe people of Earth." He chuckled a little at this and looked to the\r\nothers for approval.\r\n\r\n"That\'s right," Bragg agreed. "There\'ll always be wars, Saunders; the\r\nEarth is overpopulated, always will be."\r\n\r\n"More reason to find new worlds," Saunders said tiredly.\r\n\r\n"The only solution is war," Bragg insisted. "Survival of the fittest.\r\nForget your crazy ideas about new worlds. There\'s plenty of room right\r\nhere ... for the people who win.

"\r\n\r\n"And suppose we lose this time?" Saunders asked.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll never lose," Bragg said with certainty.\r\n\r\nSlade smiled a thin, wry smile. "Exactly, Bragg," he said. "As for me,\r\nwhenever people are ready to fight, I\'ll be ready to supply them with\r\nthe goods they\'ll need. In the meantime, the Moon can wait."\r\n\r\n"A year, maybe two," Saunders pleaded, "and the Universe will be open\r\nto us. Think of it, think of it...." Again his eyes lit with intense\r\nardor.\r\n\r\n"You think of it," Bragg said, "I\'m going home."\r\n\r\nThe other men nodded and began bustling into their overcoats. Saunders\r\nstood by helplessly, feeling his last ounce of strength seep from his\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n"Nice of you to think of us," Thorpe said cheerily. "Business is\r\nbusiness, though."\r\n\r\n"Yes," Saunders said quietly.\r\n\r\n"If you can figure a way to put a warhead on that rocket of yours,"\r\nSlade suggested.\r\n\r\n"Not a bad idea," Bragg admitted.\r\n\r\n"Well, Saunders," Peterson said, "we\'ve got to be running. No hard\r\nfeelings, of course; in fact, I wish you lots of luck." 

He chuckled\r\nagain and opened the door. 

"Good night."\r\n\r\nThe rest of the men filed out after him, nodding their farewells.\r\nSaunders watched them through the window of his laboratory, watched\r\nchauffeurs open the doors to long limousines, watched tail lights\r\ndisappear into the blackness of the night, little red pin-points\r\nemphasizing his failure.\r\n\r\nHe walked back to the table and sat, cradling his head in his arms,\r\nleaning on the blueprints of his ship.\r\n\r\n_All I needed was money_, he thought, _money and a little time. A year\r\nor two at the most. A year or two._\r\n\r\nSlowly he rose and brushed a thin hand over his wet eyes. There was\r\nwork to be done, and tomorrow was another day. He walked to the door\r\nleading to his inner laboratory and paused. It was past midnight, and\r\nbeing a punctilious person, Saunders ripped the day\'s page from the\r\ncalendar, exposing the new day to view. The new day was September 21st,\r\nthe year 3951.\r\n\r\nHe snapped off the lights and stepped quickly into the other room.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


He\'d missed the boat at every turn.\r\n           But now there were no turns left, with raw space\r\n         around him and death waiting on a lonely asteroid....\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n                      Rocket Stories, July 1953.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nJubil drifted slowly, alone except for the phosphorescent star shine\r\nthat filtered through the face-plate of his suit. He was resting,\r\nconserving the oxygen that hissed steadily and quietly through the\r\nvalve near his neck. It was time for peace; there had been too much\r\nviolence already.\r\n\r\nOnce, as his body continued its involuntary and aimless turning, Jubil\r\nsaw the dark hull of the _Mercury II_, the outer access door firmly\r\nclosed now and the stern beginning to fluoresce with the secondary\r\nradiation that betokened the firing of the drives. Still, Jubil could\r\nfeel no anger at Radik.\r\n\r\nWhen the crew had conspired to mutiny, when Radik, Olgan and the rest\r\nhad decided to take over the operation of the _Mercury II_, at that\r\ntime had been the need for honest anger. Jubil had hesitated weakly\r\ninstead, had chosen to be a bystander and had suffered the fate of the\r\naverage non-participant; he had been outcast from the closed circle\r\nof both friend and enemy. Kane, once Captain of the _Mercury II_, was\r\nnow dead and his _dis_-charred body drifting somewhere in the spatial\r\nwilderness.\r\n\r\n"Have you changed your thinking, Jubil?" It was Radik\'s voice in the\r\nhelmet phones and Jubil could almost see the heavy face with its\r\nfringe of space-black beard. Jubil rested, listening to the cosmic\r\ninterference in his R-link equipment.\r\n\r\n"Jubil! Jubil Marken! 

Have you changed your mind?"\r\n\r\n"Radik--" Jubil formed the words slowly, using his lips only and\r\nbreathing shallowly. "Piracy suits you, Radik. You are one of the\r\nruthless...."\r\n\r\nJubil could hear Radik\'s throaty chuckle. "A dead man of honor is still\r\ndead, Jubil." The communication circuit went silent except for the buzz\r\nof voices in the background. Jubil drifted on, conscious of the fact\r\nthat he was moving but so full of the lethargy of the moment that he\r\nneglected it. What would it be like, this bit of time that was left? It\r\nhad been an hour since Jubil had been forcibly ejected from the access\r\ndoor of the _Mercury II_; the flask at his back carried oxygen for\r\nfour. Three hours of life--while around his slowly turning body was the\r\nagelessness of endless space. Jubil smiled, just a little, conscious\r\nof the fact that he felt no fear. The die was cast now; he had made his\r\ndecision finally, and he did not regret it.\r\n\r\n"There is space-craft in Sector 180, Jubil," it was Radik again, "Racon\r\nhas just reported it. But they\'ll miss you by at least ten parsecs.\r\nHave you changed your mind?"\r\n\r\n"No.

"\r\n\r\n"Very well." 

Jubil could see the pulsing of the _Mercury\'s_ drives,\r\nnow. Radik was taking no chances on the strange ship still light years\r\naway from his stern being patrol. "Good news for you, Jubil. You are\r\nin the gravitational field of an asteroid. You can\'t see it, yet; it\'s\r\ndirectly above you. But you\'ll drift to it and cling like a snail on a\r\nstone for as long as time itself. Good-bye, Jubil."\r\n\r\nStrange, Jubil thought, that there was no anger in him now. There\r\nshould be oxygen enough for a good two hours yet, so this eerie ennui\r\ncould not be the prelude to a rising carbon dioxide quotient. A normal\r\nman would be bitter, perhaps even hysterical in his anger and his\r\nfear of death. Yet there was only this peaceful drifting toward the\r\nstill-invisible asteroid that hung in space above his own head. 

Jubil\r\nclosed his eyes, shutting out the phosphorescence of the velvet that\r\nwas space. The exhaust of the _Mercury II_ might still be in sight.\r\nIf so, it was not visible through the restriction of the plastic\r\nface-plate of Jubil\'s suit.\r\n\r\nJubil found himself wondering where Kane could have drifted since the\r\ncaptain\'s inert body had been shoved out of the _Mercury II\'s_ access\r\ndoor. Perhaps, even now, it was bound, like a rudderless ship, toward\r\nthe selfsame asteroid that would be Jubil\'s last and permanent home.\r\n\r\nThinking of Kane, Jubil remembered also Schoenbirk, the erratic\r\ngenius whose mathematical theorizing was used in the design of the\r\nSchoenbirk-Halsted De-Fouling Gear. Had it been years, or lifetimes\r\nago, when the three of them had been undergraduates together at the\r\nAcademy?\r\n\r\nSchoenbirk, working with the high electrostatic potentials necessary\r\nto insure the exhaust of opposite-sign waste from the complex guts of\r\nthe atomic drive had been blown to pieces by the accumulation of the\r\nvery thing his device was designed to prevent. Random electrical forces\r\ngathering around the discharge ring until their workable mass became\r\ngreat enough to enter and initiate a chain reaction in the fuel storage\r\ntank. Along with Schoenbirk had gone even the tremendously heavy\r\nconcrete walls of the laboratory. 

All that, however, had been after\r\nJubil had washed out of the Academy and gone into the space-freighters\r\nas a Drive-Engineer. In the intervening years, Jubil had become\r\nthoroughly familiar with the perfected Schoenbirk-Halsted....\r\n\r\nKane! There was a man who had made the Academy his own playground.\r\nKane had passed with the greatest of ease, worked his way through\r\nastro-navigation, the Allen Drives, space-time computations....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJubil grimaced wryly. It had been the latter with its advanced\r\nmathematics that had been his own downfall. So Kane had gone on to the\r\nfirst officer berth in a gilded passenger liner while Jubil developed\r\nradiation scars on his hands from "in the hole" engineering on decrepit\r\nfreighters.\r\n\r\nAnd the great leveller had met and conquered them all....\r\n\r\nSchoenbirk, even in the explosion that took his life had accomplished\r\na great thing: the discovery of the final flaw in the De-Fouling\r\nGear that had lived after him. For without proper removal of the\r\nionized waste from its drive engines, the largest freighter became an\r\never-accumulating and treacherously unstable fissionable pile.\r\n\r\nKane--one of the legendary figures of the history of astro-navigation.\r\nKane with his Academy background and his proud but personable air had\r\nbecome one of the most talked-of Space captains who had ever lived.\r\nJubil could still, in memory, see Kane, standing spread-kneed on the\r\nbridge of the _Comet_, one of the first; later the _Wanderer_, the\r\nfirst of the luxury space liners. The _Mercury_, and the _Mercury II_,\r\nthe super-ships that made week-end excursion flights that spanned from\r\ngalaxy to galaxy.\r\n\r\nA misplaced decimal point and a misplaced trust and the greatness\r\nof Schoenbirk and Kane lay behind them. Even as his drifting body,\r\ncumbersome in the space-suit, touched the asteroid, Jubil was aware of\r\na strange weariness that invaded every part of him except his mind. At\r\nleast, the waning oxygen would leave him his thoughts.\r\n\r\nHe rested, conserving his strength. For what reason? 

The thing that was\r\nto happen was as certain as Fate and as unavoidable by the machinations\r\nof man. Was it, after all, because Jubil was prey to anger? No. He was\r\nnow too near death for anger to seem important.\r\n\r\nThe face of the asteroid was cold and Jubil lay against it, held as\r\nlightly as a maiden\'s kiss by the ounce or so of gravity.\r\n\r\nHe was smiling as the darkness of space was suddenly brilliantly\r\nlighted. Spears of bluish flame, each with its tip of crimson, spread\r\nacross the warp of time, and subconsciously Jubil found himself waiting\r\nfor the shock wave. Then he laughed. In space there was no atmosphere;\r\nhe would never be buffeted by the blast that had destroyed the _Mercury\r\nII_ and the mutineer Radik.\r\n\r\nJubil thought again of the hellish radiation to which he had exposed\r\nhimself. There was no other way. To destroy the delicate regulating\r\nlinkage of the Schoenbirk-Halsted, a man must enter the combustion\r\nchamber where the pilot-piles idled. There had been just time enough\r\nfor that, before Radik had sent for him.\r\n\r\nHad there been ample oxygen, Jubil Marken knew that he would only have\r\nlived until his radiation-seared heart painfully failed to function.\r\nBut, thanks to Radik, Jubil had been spared both the disintegration of\r\nthe _Mercury II_ and an agonizing death from slow radiation burn.\r\n\r\nHe was, Jubil reflected, as effective in his own way as was Schoenbirk\r\nand Kane. In the end, he was still an Academy man with them. He\r\nwas peacefully smiling as he twisted tight the oxygen valve at his\r\nthroat....\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


Step right up, little lady and tell us why your eyes look\r\n    so strange! What\'s that? You want us to read this astounding science\r\n    fantasy documentary by J. Anthony Ferlaine first? Well--perhaps we\r\n    should play it safe while the flying saucer folk are watching us!_\r\n\r\n\r\n one\r\n out\r\n  of\r\n ten\r\n\r\n _by ... J. Anthony Ferlaine_\r\n\r\n\r\n There may be a town called Mars in Montana. But\r\n little Mrs. Freda Dunny didn\'t come from there!\r\n\r\n\r\nI watched Don Phillips, the commercial announcer, out of the corner of\r\nmy eye. The camera in front of me swung around and lined up on my set.\r\n\r\n"... And now, on with the show," Phillips was saying. "And here, ready\r\nto test your wits, is your quizzing quiz master, Smiling Jim Parsons."\r\n\r\nI smiled into the camera and waited while the audience applauded. The\r\ncamera tally light went on and the stage manager brought his arm down\r\nand pointed at me.\r\n\r\n"Good afternoon," I said into the camera, "here we go again with another\r\nhalf hour of fun and prizes on television\'s newest, most exciting, game,\r\n\'Parlor Quiz.\' In a moment I\'ll introduce you to our first contestant.\r\nBut first here is a special message to you mothers ..."\r\n\r\nThe baby powder commercial appeared on the monitor and I walked over to\r\nthe next set. They had the first contestant lined up for me. I smiled\r\nand took her card from the floor man. She was a middle-aged woman with a\r\nfaded print dress and old-style shoes. I never saw the contestants\r\nuntil we were on the air. They were screened before the show by the\r\nstaff. They usually tried to pick contestants who would make good show\r\nmaterial--an odd name or occupation--or somebody with twenty kids.\r\nSomething of that nature.\r\n\r\nI looked at the card for the tip off. "Mrs. Freda Dunny," the card said.\r\n"Ask her where she comes from."\r\n\r\nI smiled at the contestant again and took her by the hand. The tally\r\nlight went on again and I grinned into the camera.\r\n\r\n"Well, now, we\'re all set to go ... and our first contestant today is\r\nthis charming little lady right here beside me. Mrs. 

Freda Dunny." I\r\nlooked at the card. "How are you, Mrs. Dunny?"\r\n\r\n"Fine! Just fine."\r\n\r\n"All set to answer a lot of questions and win a lot of prizes?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'ll win all right," said Mrs. Dunny, smiling around at the\r\naudience.\r\n\r\nThe audience tittered a bit at the remark. I looked at the card again.\r\n\r\n"Where are you from, Mrs. Dunny?"\r\n\r\n"Mars!" said Mrs. Dunny.\r\n\r\n"Mars!" I laughed, anticipating the answer. "Mars, Montana? Mars, Peru?"\r\n\r\n"No, _Mars_! Up there," she said, pointing up in the air. "The planet\r\nMars. The fourth planet out from the sun."\r\n\r\nMy assistant looked unhappy.\r\n\r\nI smiled again, wondering what the gag was. I decided to play along.\r\n\r\n"Well, well," I said, "all the way from Mars, eh? And how long have you\r\nbeen on Earth, Mrs. Dunny?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, about thirty or forty years. I\'ve been here nearly all my life.\r\nCame here when I was a wee bit of a girl."\r\n\r\n"Well," I said, "you\'re practically an Earthwoman by now, aren\'t you?"\r\nThe audience laughed. "Do you plan on going back someday or have you\r\nmade up your mind to stay here on Earth for the rest of your days?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m just here for the invasion," said Mrs. Dunny. "When that\'s over\r\nI\'ll probably go back home again."\r\n\r\n"The invasion?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, the invasion of Earth. As soon as enough of us are here we\'ll get\r\nstarted."\r\n\r\n"You mean there are others here, too?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, there are several million of us here in the United States\r\nalready--and more are on the way."\r\n\r\n"There are only about a hundred and seventy million people in the United\r\nStates, Mrs. Dunny," I said. "If there are several million Martians\r\namong us, one out of every hundred would have to be a Martian."\r\n\r\n"One out of every ten!" said Mrs. 

Dunny. 

"That\'s what the boss said just\r\nthe other day. \'We\'re getting pretty close to the number we need to\r\ntake over Earth.\'"\r\n\r\n"What do you need?" I asked. 

"One to one? One Martian for every\r\nEarthman?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," said Mrs. Dunny, "one Martian is worth ten Earthmen. The only\r\nreason we\'re waiting is we don\'t want any trouble."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t look any different from us Earth people, Mrs. Dunny. How does\r\none tell the difference between a Martian and an Earthman when one sees\r\none?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, we don\'t _look_ any different," said Mrs. Dunny. "Some of the kids\r\ndon\'t even know they\'re Martians. Most mothers don\'t tell their children\r\nuntil they\'re grown-up. And there are other children who are never told\r\nbecause they just don\'t develop their full powers."\r\n\r\n"What powers?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, telepathy, thought control--that sort of thing."\r\n\r\n"You mean that Martians can read people\'s thoughts?"\r\n\r\n"Sure! It\'s no trouble at all. It\'s very easy really, once you get the\r\nhang of it."\r\n\r\n"Can you read my mind?" I asked, smiling.\r\n\r\n"Sure!" said Mrs. Dunny, smiling up at me. "That\'s why I said that I\'d\r\nknow the answers. I\'ll be able to read the answers from your mind when\r\nyou look at that sheet of paper."\r\n\r\n"Now, that\'s hardly sporting, is it, Mrs. Dunny?" 

I said, turning to the\r\ncamera. The audience laughed. "Everybody else has to do it the hard way\r\nand here you are reading it from my mind."\r\n\r\n"All\'s fair in love and war," said Mrs. Dunny.\r\n\r\n"Tell me, Mrs. Dunny. Why are you telling me about all this? Isn\'t it\r\nsupposed to be a secret?"\r\n\r\n"I have my reasons," said Mrs. Dunny. "Nobody believes me anyhow."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I believe you, Mrs. Dunny," I said gravely. "And now, let\'s see how\r\nyou do on the questions. 

Are you ready?"\r\n\r\nShe nodded.\r\n\r\n"Name the one and only mammal that has the ability to fly," I asked,\r\nreading from the script.\r\n\r\n"A bat," she said.\r\n\r\n"Right! Did you read that from my mind?

"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, you\'re coming over very clear!" said Mrs. 

Dunny.\r\n\r\n"Try this one," I said. "A princess is any daughter of a sovereign. What\r\nis a princess royal?"\r\n\r\n"The eldest daughter of a sovereign," she said.\r\n\r\n"Correct! 

How about this one? Is a Kodiak a kind of simple box camera; a\r\ntype of double-bowed boat; or a type of Alaskan bear?"\r\n\r\n"A bear," said Mrs. 

Dunny.\r\n\r\n"Very good," I said. "That was a hard one." I asked her seven more\r\nquestions and she got them all right. None of the other contestants even\r\ncame close to her score, so I wound up giving her the gas range and a\r\nlot of other smaller prizes.\r\n\r\nAfter we were off the air I followed the audience out into the hall.\r\nMrs. Dunny was walking towards the lobby with an old paper shopping bag\r\nunder her arm. An attendant was following her with an armful of prizes.\r\n\r\nI caught up with her before she reached the door.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Dunny," I said, and she turned around. 

"I want to talk to you."\r\n\r\n"When do I get the gas stove?" she said.\r\n\r\n"Your local dealer will send it to you in a few days. Did you give them\r\nyour address?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I gave it to them. My Philadelphia address, that is. I don\'t even\r\nremember my address at home any more."\r\n\r\n"Come, now, Mrs. Dunny. You don\'t have to keep up that Mars business now\r\nthat we\'re off the air."\r\n\r\n"It\'s the truth and I didn\'t come here just by accident," said Mrs.\r\nDunny, looking over her shoulder toward the attendant who was still\r\nholding the prizes. "I came here to see you."\r\n\r\n"Me?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Dunny set the paper bag down on the floor and dug down into her\r\npocketbook. She took out a dog-eared piece of white paper and bent it up\r\nin her hand.\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said finally. "I came to see you. And you didn\'t follow me\r\nout here because you wanted to. I commanded you to come."\r\n\r\n"Commanded me to come!" I spluttered. "What for?"\r\n\r\n"To prove something to you. Do you see this piece of paper?" She held\r\nout the paper in her hand with the blank side toward me. "My address is\r\non this paper. I am reading the address. 

Concentrate on what I\'m\r\nreading."\r\n\r\nI looked at her.\r\n\r\nI concentrated.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, I knew.\r\n\r\n"Two fifty-one South Eighth Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania," I said\r\naloud.\r\n\r\n"You see, it\'s very easy once you get the hang of it," she said.\r\n\r\nI nodded and smiled down at her. Now I understood. I picked up her bag\r\nand put my hand on her shoulder.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s go," I said. "We have a lot to talk about."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ November 1956.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

]\r\n\r\n\r\nJimmy Lorre saw the Earth spinning away from under him. It was odd,\r\nthis sensation of having nothing under you, nothing to keep you from\r\nfalling back upon the world from which the sleek grey space ship had\r\nlifted you. Lorre felt uneasy. He had traveled in rockets hundreds of\r\ntimes, of course; but this was his first flight into space.\r\n\r\nRockets had already been in use for nearly a century; but none had ever\r\nbefore ventured into outer space since the first one had met a horrible\r\nend in the Heaviside Layer. As a result of that incident, small rockets\r\nhad been developed for flight between cities, and, unhappily, for war.\r\n\r\nFinally a large space cruiser, equipped with the Lorre\r\npolari-neutralizer, set out in a second attempt to pierce the H-layer.\r\nAppropriately named the _New Hope_, it had just left Earth on its way\r\nto the Moon.\r\n\r\nLorre felt that some weird, alien menace confronted them. The details\r\nof the outcome of the first attempted flight to the moon lingered in\r\nhis mind. He had looked forward to this day with eagerness; yet now\r\nhe wished that he hadn\'t come along. Crushed down into the pneumatic\r\ncushions by the acceleration, his vision was so restricted that he\r\ncould see nothing but the Earth falling away from the ship, down, down.\r\n\r\nThe Lorre polari-neutralizer had been designed to send out a powerful\r\nfield of polarized force that neutralized the energy charge of the\r\nLayer, and so shield the ship from the raging storm of ions that\r\ncompose the ionosphere. James "Jimmy" Lorre, the inventor, had made\r\nsure of that. But the ionoscreen, which was to keep cosmic rays and\r\nother harmful radiations from the vessel\'s occupants beyond the Layer,\r\nhad been impossible to test. Math, however, had proved that it would\r\nfunction correctly.\r\n\r\n"Dr. 

Lorre!"\r\n\r\nThe ship had stopped accelerating, so that the pilot might have the\r\nfullest co-operation from his reflexes while passing the ionosphere.\r\n\r\n"Call me Jimmy," Lorre said succinctly. "Everybody does. What is it?"\r\n\r\nThe pilot motioned toward the complex mechanism that stood between\r\nthem and annihilation in the turbulent ionic sea they were swiftly\r\napproaching. "I wanted you to be on hand in case anything goes wrong.\r\nEven without the polari-neutralizer, the hull will stand up a few\r\nminutes, in case a wire comes loose in your machine, or something."\r\n\r\nLorre nodded. The pilot, always a thorough man, was taking no chances.\r\n\r\nHammond, at the controls of the _New Hope_, watched the chronometer\r\nlike a hawk. If the shield were applied too soon, the power would not\r\nlast; if too late, the ship would be destroyed.\r\n\r\nHe signaled the physicist. Lorre flipped the switch, gaining\r\nsatisfaction from the humming drone that came from the generators. An\r\ninstant later, they hit the Layer.\r\n\r\nLivid sheets of flame danced outside the portholes as the surging ions\r\nfought to break the shield that enveloped the ship with the intrepid\r\nband of spacefarers aboard. Could they cheat nature with their science?\r\nThe hull began to grow hot. Lorre increased the power.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Lurid sheets of flame danced outside the portholes as\r\nthe surging ions sought to break the shield._]\r\n\r\nThen they were through! The tremendous velocity gained before\r\ncutting the acceleration had carried them through! They were now in\r\nthe star-specked blackness of outer space, their ionoscreen, which\r\nduplicated conditions in the H-layer, surrounding the craft at a safe\r\ndistance. Apparently it was keeping the cosmic rays out as predicted.\r\n\r\nIt had been done at last! Space travel was an accomplished thing. Mars,\r\nVenus, the Major Planets, all were within man\'s reach. It was the dawn\r\nof a new era!\r\n\r\nHammond, the pilot, turned to congratulate the physicist who had made\r\nall this possible. But his grin faded, he raised his eyebrows in\r\nastonishment at what he saw. Lorre, having experienced the successful\r\nculmination of years of effort, lay on the floor of the control room,\r\napparently fast asleep!\r\n\r\nThat the polari-neutralizer would be a success, Lorre had felt certain.\r\nBut he could not control the elation he felt as they passed the outer\r\nedge of the Layer. _He_ had made it possible!\r\n\r\nSomeone whispered. The physicist looked at Hammond. The pilot was\r\nstaring out the port. Then he heard it again. 

But this time it\r\nwas--commanding! Commanding him to lie down!\r\n\r\nLorre did so. He seemed unable to summon the will power to resist.\r\nThe whisper went on. It seemed to be communicating directly with his\r\nmind, without the use of the indirect route through sense organs. When\r\nLorre realized that the whisper began to form coherent words. He became\r\noblivious to all else.\r\n\r\nThus it was that when Hammond tore his gaze from the port, he found the\r\nphysicist in a comatose condition. Rapidly, he summoned the rest of the\r\ncrew.\r\n\r\nIt consisted of--a doctor, a bio-chemist, a metallurgist, and a\r\nmechanic. They had been picked out of hundreds of volunteers. Able men,\r\nthey were ready for any emergency that might arise.\r\n\r\nThe doctor immediately tried to bring the seemingly unconscious man\r\naround. Lorre came to suddenly.\r\n\r\n"What\'s wrong?" he inquired of the doctor, who explained as much as he\r\nknew, which was little.\r\n\r\n"Of course," said Lorre. "I might have known." Then, "Hammond!"\r\n\r\n"Yes?"\r\n\r\n"Decelerate immediately. We must return to Earth as soon as possible."\r\n\r\n"But the moon?"\r\n\r\n"The moon is comparatively unimportant now. Besides, I can tell you\r\nexactly what we would find there. 

I\'ll explain everything as we go\r\nback. Start the generators. We must accumulate power to penetrate the\r\nH-layer on our return."\r\n\r\nLorre being the leader, the pilot adjusted the jets to turn.\r\n\r\n"Now, would you explain this rather--er--abrupt alteration in our\r\nplans, Dr. Lorre?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly. 

Call the rest of the men back.

"\r\n\r\nHammond did so. 

The mechanic appeared undisturbed; he wasn\'t even\r\ncurious. The bio-chemist and the metallurgist were greatly interested;\r\nthe doctor wondered whether the success of the polari-neutralizer had\r\nshaken the sanity of its inventor.\r\n\r\n"The universe," began Dr. Lorre, "is full of mysteries as yet unsolved.\r\nOne of these is the cosmic rays.\r\n\r\n"We know little of their origin or their properties. It seems, however,\r\nthat they have a marked effect on evolution.\r\n\r\n"The Kennelly-Heaviside Layer screens out most of these rays. It is as\r\na result of this that evolution can go slowly forward toward its goal.\r\nFor should all the cosmic rays reach Earth, life would devolve back\r\ninto protoplasm!\r\n\r\n"In the back of the so-called Horse\'s Head dark nebula is a dying star.\r\nThe nebula shields us from the cosmic rays it gives off. But in only\r\na few years our sun will carry us directly in the path of a deluge of\r\nthese rays against which our ionosphere will be too weak! Man will go\r\nback to the caveman days from which he emerged. But he will not stop\r\nthere. He will go back to primal protoplasm. Then, because the ray\r\nbarrage will be too strong for it, it will die. All life will go the\r\nsame way. In less than one million years, the world will be devoid of\r\nlife!\r\n\r\n"There is a way out. We can build a machine to strengthen the Heaviside\r\nLayer. It will be merely an ionoscreen around the entire world, to hold\r\nback the rays that pass the natural ionosphere. I have been given the\r\ndetails of the machine, and by the time we arrive on Earth I will have\r\nthem down on paper--"\r\n\r\n"But how do you know all this?" 

the doctor interrupted. He was still in\r\ndoubt about Lorre\'s sanity.\r\n\r\n"On Mars there is an age old civilization that faces the same peril,"\r\nwas the reply. "For years they have been trying to warn us of what\r\nthey knew would come. 

Their telepathy, however, was unable to pierce\r\nour H-layer. When we emerged from it, they immediately detected our\r\nthought vibrations, which are not stopped by the ionoscreen, and began\r\ncommunication with the most receptive mind aboard. It happened to be\r\nmine."\r\n\r\n"So when I found you lying in a comatose condition, you were talking to\r\nthe Martians?" asked Hammond, dazedly.\r\n\r\n"That\'s right. The sooner we can start building the ionoscreen machine\r\nas the Martians have already done, the better we\'ll be off.\r\n\r\n"It is likely that you are wondering as to whether I am in full\r\npossession of all my mental faculties, doctor. You will find that I am\r\nquite sane when the first Earth-Mars trip is made. The Martians are\r\neven now preparing to receive visitors from Earth. They have no space\r\nships; their science of mechanics is not as highly developed as ours."\r\n\r\nRocket tubes flaring silently in the void, the _New Hope_ turned its\r\nnose Earthward, bearing the timely warning that would save mankind from\r\na terrible fate.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


"All clear," and both men removed their helmets. They wiped sweat\r\nfrom their faces and glanced at each other.\r\n\r\nThe blonde man said, "The air\'s okay, Jarvis. Everything seems all\r\nright. 

I don\'t get it."\r\n\r\nJarvis, his dark eyes wary, scowled as he looked about. "It seems all\r\nright. 

But we know it isn\'t. 

It can\'t be."\r\n\r\n"I\'m shucking this suit."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be a fool, Mark!"\r\n\r\n"But the dial read _clear_, man! And we know nobody is going to shoot\r\nus. All life _had_ to be wiped out.

"\r\n\r\n"How about minor power installations?"\r\n\r\nJarvis took a chocolate bar from his pocket, sat down on a piece of\r\nbroken rubble and began to eat. "You\'re too careless--far too careless,\r\nMark."\r\n\r\nMark laughed. "You\'ve always been cautious enough for both of us. Got me\r\nout of plenty of scrapes back in school, too. Don\'t think I\'ve\r\nforgotten." Affection warmed his blue eyes as they rested on the face of\r\nhis friend.\r\n\r\n"Okay! Okay! 

But what happened to them? 

Where did they go?" Jarvis took\r\nnervous bites from his second chocolate bar. Then he, too, peeled off\r\nhis suit. He sniffed the air distrustfully, as he wiggled his shoulders\r\nto free them from the clinging, damp shirt. Then he took a few\r\nexperimental steps forward.\r\n\r\n"Seems all right, Mark. But how do you explain about Hank and Garland?\r\nNever were two more careful guys."\r\n\r\n"Probably a simple miscalculation. Or an accident. We know it couldn\'t\r\nhave been enemy action. Tests prove conclusively that we wiped them\r\nout--to a man." He took deep gulps of air into his lungs, and stretched\r\nlike a cat. "We\'ll find out soon enough. 

Boy, I feel great!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey deflated and folded their safety suits and added the bundles to the\r\nother equipment on their backs. Then, with their instruments held before\r\nthem, they probed their way into the twisted wreckage, still following\r\nthe faint, dust-filled footprints.\r\n\r\nBent and rusted girders rose on all sides like the bones of prehistoric\r\nmonsters. Nothing stirred. The dust lay ages-thick on everything.\r\n\r\n"Gives you the spooks, doesn\'t it?" Jarvis was still tense, poised to\r\nrespond to the first signal of danger. "Feels like we\'re the last men\r\nalive!"\r\n\r\n"Funny about Hank and Garland. There\'s nothing here to harm anyone."\r\n\r\nJarvis looked at his watch. "Better contact HQ for instructions."\r\n\r\nThe two stepped off the path, into the shade of a grotesque chunk of\r\nbroken masonry. Mark set up the radio and twirled the dials. "Team Four,\r\ncalling HQ. Team Four, reporting!"\r\n\r\n"HQ here." The voice from the radio blared loud in the stillness. "Give\r\nyour report, Team Four."\r\n\r\n"Looks like nothing\'s moved here in a thousand years. Safe as a baby\'s\r\ndream. Rock-solid, air morning-pure. But--" He hesitated, trying not to\r\nsound like a scared school boy. "No sign of Team Three. Or of Teams One\r\nand Two, either. Over."\r\n\r\n"Look here, Team Four. It\'s your job to find out. The earth didn\'t just\r\nswallow them. Final report from each team placed them well within the\r\ncity. It\'s been ten days since the last contact. Probe every inch of the\r\nplace."\r\n\r\n"Right!"\r\n\r\n"But be careful. We can\'t afford to lose any more men! Roger!"\r\n\r\n"Roger!"\r\n\r\nThere was only one way now--ahead. It lay clearly marked. 

The dim\r\nfootsteps never strayed or faltered. Three hours of search revealed no\r\npitfalls, no dangers, and no trace of the missing men. Then night was\r\nupon them and they bedded down gratefully.\r\n\r\n"Strange, isn\'t it? The war over. The invaders blasted from the earth.\r\nAll peril gone. And yet--men disappear."\r\n\r\nJarvis stared at the ruins around them. "I can\'t take much more, Mark.\r\nTwelve years of war is enough. Are we never to have a life--have our\r\nhome and women back, and--_peace_?"\r\n\r\n"Sure, it\'s been tough. But think of the women and children isolated on\r\nthat sub-satellite. It\'s tougher for them--just waiting." Stretched on\r\nhis back, Mark stared at the cloudless, evening sky. "But pretty soon\r\nwe\'ll get this planet cleaned up and bring them in. Christ! Four years\r\nwithout even seeing a woman. I remember the last time--"\r\n\r\n"Okay!" Jarvis interrupted impatiently. "Let\'s get to sleep."\r\n\r\n"Sure, pal. Goodnight."\r\n\r\nThey fell asleep to dream of green hills, corn ripening, apples roasting\r\nover an open fire. Peace, and home, and girls, their firm legs flashing\r\nin the sun.\r\n\r\nSoldierlike, Mark was suddenly awake. He lay without motion, sensitive\r\nto some subtle change in the surroundings. From the corner of his eye he\r\ncould see Jarvis wrapped in sleep. The silence seemed eternal.\r\n\r\nThen, whisper-soft, came a murmur, a sound, a voice. A girl\'s voice,\r\nsighing and singing, from deep in that devastated spot.\r\n\r\nA woman!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nInstantly, Mark was on his feet. No need to wake Jarvis. Plenty of time\r\nfor Jarvis to find out--afterwards. But not yet! A miracle that a girl\r\nhad survived in all that wreckage. But a miracle he wanted to savour\r\nalone!\r\n\r\nAhead, the path turned and Mark followed it as it went forward again,\r\ndownhill, between the massed walls of rubble. Now the voice swelled, a\r\nmelancholy song. Well, she won\'t be melancholy for long, Mark thought.\r\nHer solitary ordeal was over.\r\n\r\n"Mark!" Jarvis stood on an upturned lintel, ten feet above Mark\'s head.\r\nAs Mark jerked to a stop at the cry, Jarvis jumped into his path. "You\r\nfool! 

Don\'t you know it\'s a trap?"\r\n\r\n"So that\'s how you want to play it? The noble friend, protecting me from\r\nmyself!" He slammed a fist into the side of Jarvis\' head. "Well, I won\'t\r\nbite! 

She\'s mine! I found her!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn silence, in the narrow passage between the rocks, the two fought.\r\nSuddenly, above the sound of fist on flesh, came the voice of the girl\r\nagain, clear, young. "She _is_ there," thought Jarvis. He could almost\r\ntaste her lips on his. The sensation came as a shock. How did he know?\r\nHe\'d never had a woman. That\'s what came from listening to the tales of\r\nMark\'s exploits with women. Now he had to have that girl!\r\n\r\nThe mounting tension of the fighting snapped something in Jarvis\'\r\nseething mind. Danger, friendship, duty, all meant nothing. Only one\r\nthing mattered. The girl! Mark had had more than his share of girls. He,\r\nJarvis, was the one who should have her! He\'d been deprived of his\r\nmanhood long enough! His frenzied brain hunted a trick to gain his ends.\r\n\r\nMark\'s superior strength began to force Jarvis to give ground. Then a\r\nfinal blow sent him reeling, he reached out to break his fall, his hand\r\nclosed on a rock. He threw it. Mark crashed to the ground, his knee\r\nsmashed, his leg useless. Then the tomb stillness of the dead city took\r\nover. The dust settled slowly. Mark came to his feet.\r\n\r\nJarvis was gone.\r\n\r\nDragging his useless leg, Mark forced himself to crawl forward. Jarvis\r\nhad to be stopped.\r\n\r\nAhead, a shadow moved, and for a moment the moon threw the silhouette of\r\na man against a cavernous opening in the debris.\r\n\r\n"Jarvis!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn electric flash shattered the darkness. The jagged teeth of the bolt\r\nspit tongues of fire. Cordite mingled with the raw, nauseant, revolting\r\nsmell of scorched flesh and hair. The figure tottered and fell into the\r\nblack mouth of the cave. Then, as the flame faded, it lit up small\r\nbundles of charred bones near the fallen body.\r\n\r\nThere was a whir and a click of a mechanism. Fifteen feet away, Mark\r\nwatched as the arm of a phonograph rose, moved slowly back to the\r\nstarting point. Then the record began once more to grind out its\r\ndeath-trap melody.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ March 1954.

]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is infinitely more satisfactory to purchase wives when they are\r\nyoung. They are vastly more respectful.\r\n\r\nTwelve is a good purchasing age. Lisa was twelve when I bargained for\r\nher, and she is an illustrious argument for the system.\r\n\r\nI recall her excellent father and I facing each other across his\r\ngleaming synthol marble table that day. On the table were small metal\r\nshells of sweet liquor. And beside the shells were the sedulously\r\ngathered treasures I was formally offering for Lisa: A control knob,\r\nand a folded painting of one of our Navigator\'s other-ship visions.\r\n\r\nLisa\'s father eagerly examined the mirror-bright, chrome surface\r\nof the control knob--which I had handed to him with a pretense of\r\ncasualness--trying to still the trembling of his fingers.\r\n\r\n"The last knob on the control board!" he said in an emotion-cracked\r\nvoice. 

"How could you have broken it off? We\'ve all been tugging at it\r\nfor years."\r\n\r\nI answered--I hope with no more than legitimate pride--"I managed to\r\nget a thin hacksaw blade between the knob and the control board. Then I\r\nsawed off the shaft."\r\n\r\nHe nodded approvingly. "With knuckle-headed men like you aboard ship we\r\nwill certainly all go to _Hell_."\r\n\r\nI bowed, but I did not let his flattery relax my caution. After all, we\r\nwere bargaining for his prettiest daughter. What flattering words bear\r\nweight in the midst of a sale? He, of course, referred to the ringing\r\nsincerity of our Navigator\'s dying words: "If you knuckle-heads all\r\nwant to go to _Hell_, just keep dismantling the ship!"\r\n\r\nSwinging adroitly to my other item of barter, I mused aloud, "Our\r\nNavigator! What a strange, frantic creature he was. Full of the wild,\r\nlovely visions which effervesced from his books of fantasy. Imploring\r\nus not only to read the books but to believe them--and, failing that,\r\ndrawing immortal paintings of the fantasies for us to see."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTherewith I opened the folded painting and handed it reverently to him.\r\nIt showed a large globular ship with people living on the _outside_ of\r\nit. The title of the painting was _Planet_.\r\n\r\nPrivately I had always thought the thing was wholly unnatural--a\r\ncurious off-beat of the master\'s imagination. I was quite willing,\r\ndespite its great beauty and its origin, to exchange it for something\r\nwhich to me was far more attractive at the moment. Namely a woman.\r\n\r\nLisa lay curled up on the narrow, in-wall couch, with her head propped\r\nup by a slim arm. She chewed her synthel-gum lazily and surveyed me\r\nwith mild interest. 

She was a tender-featured girl, with shimmering\r\nblack, shoulder-length hair. It was possible to forecast that she would\r\nsome day be a lovely and gentle-hearted woman.\r\n\r\nHer father, notwithstanding his habitually rigid integrity, saw my\r\nlively interest in her and tried to increase my generous bid for her by\r\nan artifice of delay.\r\n\r\nHolding the painting of the master at arm\'s length, he grumbled\r\ncritically, "A vision of _Hell_ would have been more to my liking.\r\nUnhappily our Navigator did not paint one of his radiant visions of\r\nthat ship. Now, why would he prefer _Planet_ to _Hell_--particularly\r\nwhen he described _Hell_ as warm and enclosed like our own ship?"\r\n\r\nI did not answer his frivolous complaint, knowing full well it was only\r\nbartering talk.\r\n\r\nHe handled the immortal painting with crudely feigned indifference. He\r\ncould not quite bring himself to let go of it. He was determined to own\r\nit, I knew, and he sensed also my resolve to offer no more for Lisa.\r\nYet slyly he determined on an evil course.\r\n\r\nFor, incredibly, he turned to tranquil Lisa and asked: "What is your\r\nvalue, lovely child? Does he offer enough?"\r\n\r\nAnd slowly lifting her candid eyes to him she shook her head NO!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Shall I bargain with _her_ then?" I asked my friend caustically. I\r\nwill own I was vexed.\r\n\r\nShrewdly he nodded. "Whatever she accepts will be our bargain." Then,\r\nlaughing at my undignified discomfiture, "It is manifest she is more\r\naware of her value than I."\r\n\r\n"Will you be serious? It is not kindly to banter with a woman-child in\r\nsuch an important matter as her future."\r\n\r\nBut greed now fully possessed him. "I do not joke. Whatever she demands\r\nshall be her price." He sipped his sweet wine, hiding his eyes from my\r\ndispleasure.\r\n\r\nConcealing my fury, I turned to Lisa, who now sat up straight on the\r\nnarrow couch with her long, slender legs folded under her. In the pace\r\nof grievous mortification I was not bitter toward her. 

It was not her\r\nfault. For her I extended the tolerance due the innocent.\r\n\r\n"What is your cost, child?" I asked. "This control knob and other-ship\r\nvision of our Navigator are sufficient to purchase any girl-woman. What\r\nwill you have?"\r\n\r\nLisa chewed her gum slowly while she formed her serene thought. Then,\r\nshaking her oval head, she let fall in a dreamy, singsong voice,\r\n"Neither of these! Neither of these!

"\r\n\r\nHer father leaned forward anxiously. I told her, "There is a limit to\r\nyour value. I will not give all of my treasures for you, lovely though\r\nyou are. Choose what thing you will have, and if I can procure it, your\r\nfather shall have it."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll know it when I see it!" she said, smiling impudently.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was nothing for me to do but go to my apartments and look for\r\nother treasures to show her. My thoughts were exceedingly bitter as I\r\ngathered the coveted articles one by one in my arms.\r\n\r\n"Here." I displayed it to her when I had arrived back at her father\'s\r\nabode. "It is the steering wheel from the lifeboat. Feel its smooth\r\ntexture, see its ebony luster. It is the only lifeboat steering wheel\r\naboard ship. I had a terrible struggle with it until I broke off the\r\nshaft.

"\r\n\r\nShe seemed interested. I passed hurriedly on to another object. "Here\r\nis the handle of the atomic-pile damping rod. It was threaded inside.\r\nHowever, I have managed to grind the interior smooth."\r\n\r\nShe seemed definitely interested, but I did not linger. 

I unrolled the\r\nlast treasure I had brought with me. At the sight of it her father\r\nburst into merry chuckles.\r\n\r\n"Yes," I said, smiling with a hint of sadness. "It is the inscrutable\r\nmessage we found protruding from the mouth of a machine some years ago.\r\nThe machine has the name Teletype engraved upon it. We cannot imagine\r\nwho put the message inside the machine--if indeed it is a message.\r\nBut listen to the poetry of its words! I shall read it to you as\r\nthough it were properly set out on paper instead of being cramped into\r\ncontinuous, senseless lines:\r\n\r\n    "Colony ship, colony ship,\r\n    Turn around before it is too late.\r\n    You have left the Galaxy.\r\n    We are the last planetary system\r\n    You will encounter,\r\n    For ten thousand years."\r\n\r\nThen, seeing her puzzlement, I said hastily, "But, of course, it is\r\ntoo adult for you, Lisa. Its mystery is for the scholar, its abstract\r\nbeauty for the man of mature years. Come, let us turn back to these\r\nother treasures...."\r\n\r\nIt was not easy for her to choose, seemingly, with so much wealth about\r\nher. The control knob, the painting, the lifeboat steering wheel, the\r\natomic-pile damping-rod handle, the inscrutable poetry--all claimed her\r\ninterest. But in the end she chose as I wanted her to, and the bargain\r\nwas struck.\r\n\r\nLisa went to live in the compartment of my concubines that day, and at\r\nmaturity became a concubine of exotic beauty. She bore her dark-haired\r\nchildren well.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy the excellence of her father, he and I continued to be good friends.\r\nAt least once a year I invite him to view the master\'s painting of\r\n_Planet_. We spend many contented hours together. 

Often through a\r\nporthole we watch the rapid movement of distant ships which our\r\nNavigator called _stars_, revolving in tiny circles at the side of the\r\nship, making a complete circle in about two minutes. What prompts the\r\nbehavior of these ships? It is all very curious, and I account myself\r\nfortunate that I have in my friend an intense capacity for speculation.\r\nLike myself, he is a scholar of honor, capable of long sustained\r\ndiscourse on lofty subjects which round out and deepen the mind. I\r\nforgive him his greed.\r\n\r\nAs I had intended, Lisa took the teletype nonsense message to be\r\nher value to her father. May I reiterate, it is infinitely more\r\nsatisfactory to purchase wives when they are very young ladies? 

They\r\nare vastly more respectful. Admittedly they are saucy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\nOld Thak watched fondly as the new telescope was being put into its\r\nplace. He had been a long time persuading the elders to build this\r\ninstrument, a duplicate of the one destroyed in the latest great war.\r\nIt was as fine a telescope as Mars could produce, and only Thak\'s\r\nassurances that the work was of the greatest importance had secured\r\nhim this luxury.\r\n\r\nHis project must succeed, he felt, glancing at his students. Like him,\r\nthey were almost spherical in shape, with fine arm-like appendages\r\nringing their middles. They were young and enthusiastic, and Thak\r\nbelieved they could revive the science of astronomy. He, the last\r\nastronomer of Mars, would teach them all he knew.\r\n\r\nThe overseer of the workers was disgusted. "You waste our resources,\r\nThak," he declared. "You have taken two years of labor by dozens of\r\nworkers, and for what? So that you may look at the sky!"\r\n\r\nThak\'s tentacles purpled, a sign of irritation. "You military men!" 

he\r\nretorted. "It was your kind, Mitfpa, that destroyed our civilization\r\nand reduced our race to a few hungry thousands. You have ruined\r\nprogress and science forever. You have hastened the death of our race.\r\nUnless--"\r\n\r\nHe waved through the open doorway, pointing out the early evening sky.\r\nJust rising over the horizon was a blue body that was of a dazzling\r\nbrilliance, outshining all the other heavenly bodies. Thak\'s voice\r\nbecame emotional.\r\n\r\n"On that planet," he said, "are civilized beings. They hold the only\r\nhope for the salvation of our race. We must work to contact them, as\r\nlong as there is one of us to carry on!

"\r\n\r\n"What is this, Thak?" 

Mitfpa demanded angrily. "How can you say, old\r\none, that people of intelligence live on the blue planet? 

You will tell\r\nme next that you have been there!"\r\n\r\nThe soldier laughed scornfully, but Thak\'s voice was unruffled as he\r\nexplained. "This is no mere fancy of mine. 

These people have been\r\nsignalling to us for some time. And when I signalled back by creating\r\na network of space-warping lines through our entire power system, they\r\nstrengthened their signals. Then came your war--"\r\n\r\n"Space warps?" Mitfpa growled. "More power wasted? 

How was this\r\naccomplished?"\r\n\r\nThe workers were bolting the last legs of the telescope into position,\r\nand the students were making happy squeaks. Thak looked gratefully\r\ntoward his new instrument, and toward the scholars. A fine lot of young\r\nones, these. Perhaps, in them, astronomy would become once more a\r\nscience of great importance. Perhaps they would be the salvation of\r\nMars.\r\n\r\nHe answered Mitfpa\'s questions. "The power used was very small. You\r\nhave heard of controlled space warps?"\r\n\r\n"What about it?" grumbled the soldier.\r\n\r\n"An interesting laboratory trick. But it also occurs in nature.\r\nAs a youth I once saw the light of stars bent around the sun in a\r\nselector-scope; indeed, it was this very phenomenon that showed our\r\nscientists how to make their own warps."\r\n\r\n"Enough of your lecture, old one. What was the result of this\r\nscientific trickery?"\r\n\r\n"One as stupid as you would not understand the method," Thak replied\r\nlevelly, "but the result of warping all of our power beams was a\r\nnetwork of opaque lines that to an observer would be an obvious signal.\r\nAnd now, if you are quite ready to leave--?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGrumbling, Mitfpa departed, taking his soldier-worker with him. Thak\r\nchecked the placement of the telescope, finally nodding in satisfaction\r\nas he found everything in proper order. The four students crowded\r\naround, watching with interest. He gazed good-naturedly at them.\r\n\r\n"Our work is a great one," he declared. "We must communicate with\r\nthe third planet by means of a system of signals that we shall work\r\nout--in time. But there is so little time...." His tentacles curled\r\nthoughtfully about him. "You have followed the work of our last great\r\nphysicist, _Mor_ Gran?"\r\n\r\n"You mean," asked an alert youngster named Rofan, "the probability\r\ntables worked out by him? Showing that the end is near for our race?"\r\n\r\nThak nodded sadly. "Indeed, lad, the future appears dark. War and its\r\ndisorganization must inevitably strangle civilization. Even now our\r\nrace is thinned in numbers, and the beasts of the desert multiply."\r\n\r\n"There," he went on, waving toward the blue planet, "is our only hope.\r\nIf we can effect communication with them, and be guided by their\r\nsuperior wisdom, we may yet rally. They may have some secret--some way\r\nto prevent wars--"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _"There!" Thak said. "There lies our only hope."_]\r\n\r\n"You continue to speak of their superior wisdom, _Mor_ Thak," said\r\nRofan. "How can you be so very sure of that?

"\r\n\r\n"It is obvious, lad. Their signal system consists of spots of light\r\nover the greater part of the land surface of their planet. I have shown\r\nyou the old photographs, taken before the last war, showing these\r\nlights. Even with the small telescope I have been forced to use during\r\nthese lean years, I have watched the lights. What a mighty science\r\ntheirs must be that can make the night time light merely to signal\r\nanother planet! For that can be the only purpose of the lights."\r\n\r\nRofan let his tentacles curl about him as he concentrated. "You must be\r\nright," he finally agreed. "I was going to suggest that they might be\r\nthe lights of cities. I noticed many of them were situated where a city\r\nwould be likely--but there must be millions of beings to populate so\r\nmany cities--"\r\n\r\nOne of the other pupils made a loud amused noise. "Whoever heard of\r\na city without a roof?" he demanded. "Could lights be seen through a\r\nroof?"\r\n\r\nRofan was embarrassed, and he remained very quiet for a while,\r\nwondering how he could have made such a stupid error. Of course lights\r\ncould not be seen through a roof. And who had ever heard of a city\r\nwithout a roof!\r\n\r\nThak, paying no attention to the byplay, focused his lens with great\r\ncare. The students gathered about the concave bowl of white quartz.\r\nThe lights were lowered, and into the bowl moved a blurred sphere. As\r\nThak\'s tentacles moved the lenses closer and closer into focus, the\r\nsphere resolved itself with more and more clarity, until it was a fine\r\nimage of the third planet.\r\n\r\nAwed by the splendor of the sight, the students could only stare. And\r\nindeed it was a breathtaking spectacle, as if they were gathered in the\r\nimmense void of space itself, looking at the planet from a height of\r\nseveral thousand miles.\r\n\r\nThere were five continents in two major land masses, Thak had told\r\nthem. In addition, there were several islands of great size, at last\r\none being practically of continental dimensions, besides a host of\r\nislands large and small which dotted the surface of the planet.\r\n\r\nThe hemisphere on which they gazed was mostly water. The larger land\r\nmass was passing from sight. And half of the smaller mass was presented\r\nto their vision, a double continent that spread almost from pole to\r\npole, with a narrow isthmus joining north and south.\r\n\r\nLike all Martians, they thrilled to a scene of fearful beauty, and they\r\nstood around the quartz bowl for a long time, not speaking, merely\r\nwatching the twin continents come into full view. None noticed old\r\nThak\'s eyes peering desperately at the image of the third planet. 

Nor\r\ndid they see the look of utter despair that grew in his face. They were\r\ntoo intent on the strange scene.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was Rofan who first felt that something was wrong. The novelty was\r\nwearing off, and an elusive thought made him uncomfortable. Something\r\nwas wrong with the picture ... what was it?\r\n\r\nSuddenly he realized. He turned to Thak. "But--the lights, _Mor_ Thak?\r\nThe signals--"\r\n\r\nThak\'s face looked as old as Mars itself as he gazed at his pupil. He\r\nstarted to speak several times before he could manage.\r\n\r\n"We have failed," he said, in heavy tones. "Our signals must have been\r\ntoo weak for the beings of the blue planet to detect. I had hoped--"\r\n\r\nHe arose and looked sadly into the evening sky. "I had hoped I was\r\nwrong. For two years now--our years--I have watched through my\r\nsmall telescope, and the lights have been disappearing, one by one,\r\nsometimes, but more often several at a time. I thought it was the\r\nweakness of my instrument. 

I was wrong. Every light on the blue planet\r\nhas been blacked out..."\r\n\r\nHis voice was a low wail. "_And--the blacking out of those lights means\r\na blackout of life on Mars. A planet-wide blackout...._"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe grizzled old space veteran leaned back in his chair and stared up\r\nthrough the transparent dome. In the black sky myriad white specks\r\ngleamed without twinkling, their light unbent by atmosphere or dust.\r\nThe steady pulse of the airmakers kept rhythm with the heartbeats of\r\nthe young men seated in a semi-circle, listening with glistening eyes\r\nto these ancient tales of an Earth they\'d never seen--the home of their\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nThey stared hungrily at the old man\'s face. There was a silvery spot on\r\nthe chin where Venusian fungus had nearly gotten into his bloodstream\r\nand had had to be burned away. Over one eye an eyebrow was gone,\r\nreplaced by scar tissue grown on a planet at the other end of the\r\ngalaxy where the light of enormous fireflies wasn\'t cold, as on ancient\r\nearth, but searing with heat.\r\n\r\n"Imagine," they marveled, "such weak flame in fireflies."\r\n\r\n"Not weak," corrected the old man. "Just different. Those insects on\r\nEarth didn\'t have to fight off intense cold. They had a much thicker\r\natmosphere and were close to the sun. And they didn\'t feed on alcohol."\r\n\r\nThe young men\'s eyes glittered. They were an odd group. Small--most of\r\nthem, none over five feet five inches--and pale, unlike the old man\r\nwho was bulky around the shoulders and had skin virtually leathered by\r\nvarious radiations and temperatures and winds.\r\n\r\nEach day this group waited hungrily for the old man to come and talk to\r\nthem. The stories he told were the breath of life to them. And of all\r\nthe tales of adventures in the far ends of the universe, the one that\r\nwas most repeatedly called for was the story of what had happened to\r\nEarth.\r\n\r\n"Tell us about Earth," said one of them, now, in a low voice.\r\n\r\n"About how great we were?" said the old man. "About what love was like?\r\nAbout homes and children and how a man went to work in the morning at\r\ntasks of his own choosing? Or...."\r\n\r\n"No. About what happened. 

You know. 

At the finish."\r\n\r\nThe old man looked up again. His eyes were dreamy.\r\n\r\n"Earth," he said, softly. "Earth. I\'ve been through the galaxies these\r\nlast forty years and I\'ve seen planets by the thousand. And there never\r\nwas one like Earth."\r\n\r\n"Tell us," they said, each in urgent, differing words, but all with the\r\nsame tortured look. "Tell us about what went wrong."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve told you that a hundred times," he said.\r\n\r\nBut they wanted it again. Like a man who relives an incident to examine\r\neach moment with incredulity, as if in hope that it will fade and not\r\nhave happened, as if in unconscious attempt to move sideways from that\r\npoint into another time stream probability where a different course of\r\naction will be true.\r\n\r\n"All right," said the old man.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first they had heard of the strangers from outer space was when\r\nthe new ultra short-wave frequencies were used. Professor Kennicot of\r\nPalmira University was the first to find how to generate and control\r\nthem. He tried to transform the wavelengths upward to a range either\r\nauditory or visual but for some reason power was lost in the process.\r\n\r\nApparently he gave them a sufficient jolt with extra voltage, however,\r\nbecause they were picked up by the strangers in outer space as a\r\nsignal. The heaviside layer did not stop these wavelengths.\r\n\r\nProfessor Kennicot was startled one day when he heard, or thought he\r\nheard, a soundless voice in his mind. It said:\r\n\r\n"Interesting. We didn\'t know there was life on your planet or in your\r\nsolar system."\r\n\r\nProfessor Kennicot shook his head and looked around. Nobody was in the\r\nlaboratory.\r\n\r\n"Of course," said the voice, "We detected atomic radiations from the\r\narea, but Zeetal thought it might come from your sun. Tell us, please,\r\nare you a Grade Three society?"\r\n\r\n"My God," muttered Professor Kennicot. "I\'m having hallucinations."\r\n\r\n"There seems to be some difficulty establishing telepathic\r\ncommunication," came the puzzled thought. And then, after a pause,\r\n"Could it be we\'re in communication with creatures of zero grade?"\r\n\r\nAnother thought from elsewhere answered, and yet Professor Kennicot,\r\nsomewhat, was tuned in: "Impossible. The signal picked up was very\r\nclose to telepathic frequency."\r\n\r\nIt wasn\'t until two days later that Professor Kennicot discovered that\r\nhe wasn\'t the only one who had experienced the auditory hallucination.\r\nThe entire college was babbling about how Professor Johnson had come\r\nrunning out of the Chemistry Lab, which was two doors away from\r\nPhysics, holding his head and babbling nonsense.\r\n\r\nProfessor Kennicot made a beeline for the hospital and had a quiet\r\ndiscussion with Professor Johnson, a discussion which is now historic.\r\nThey discovered that not only were both their I.Q.s over one hundred\r\nand eighty, but that both of them, sitting together discussing the\r\nmatter, were simultaneously getting new messages which nobody around\r\nthem was receiving.\r\n\r\nIt wasn\'t long after that, of course, that many of the most brilliant\r\nmen on Earth were reporting the same hallucinations, and as news of\r\nit spread it became obvious that not all could be insane in exactly\r\nthe same way with the same thoughts. Excitement and puzzlement ran\r\ntremendously high because, although these intellects of Earth could\r\nreceive telepathic messages, they were not advanced enough to send.\r\nThey only knew what was being messaged to them; and this continued to\r\nbe so until feverishly working physicists pinned down the telepathic\r\nwavelength mechanically. That was when conversations were begun and\r\nthe entire Earth was able to listen in, by translation and regular\r\nbroadcast.\r\n\r\nThe discussions did not go well. The beings from outer space would not\r\nanswer questions. They only asked. The first thing, apparently, that\r\nmade them cautious, was the first official question from Earth.\r\n\r\n"How is it that we understand your thought even though many of our\r\nscientists speak different languages?"\r\n\r\nThe whole world awaited the first answer. 

None came. 

There was a\r\nsilence lasting four hours. Then came a message:\r\n\r\n"Your question indicates you may be a low grade of developed life.\r\nWe shall investigate and fit you into our needs according to your\r\ncapabilities."\r\n\r\nA thrill of horror went around the world. What kind of monsters were\r\nthese? What would they do? The uproar that ensued was full of frantic\r\nmilitary preparations. Bombs were readied in the atomic planes, rockets\r\nwere raised in their cradles adjustable to any orbit. Unfortunately,\r\nnobody thought to conceal this, and some fool had failed to shut\r\noff the telepathic wavelength. One morning the world awoke to a\r\nnon-electrical society in which nothing electrical would work.\r\n\r\n"We have put a field of force around your planet," came the message.\r\n"There must be no violence. Be not afraid. 

We come as friends. We will\r\nappear now and investigate. 

Be calm."\r\n\r\nThe leaders of each nation spoke to their people, and the world waited\r\nin tense silence. One day an enormous sphere appeared and landed. The\r\ncreatures that emerged couldn\'t be clearly discerned because they were\r\nin space-suits which gave them comfortable air-pressures and what was\r\nto them breathable atmosphere. They were four-legged creatures but\r\ncould walk on two, if necessary.\r\n\r\nA delegation of picked dignitaries started to show them our world, our\r\ncustoms, the way we dressed, what we lived in, what we ate. Almost\r\nimmediately the strangers turned and left our world.\r\n\r\nWithin two days Earth was in bondage.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe old space veteran stopped. He looked around at the tense faces.\r\n\r\n"We found out later," he said. 

"It was the banquet they watched on a\r\nfilm which we ran off, that did it. There was a scene where a waiter\r\nbrings in a whole roast pig with an apple in its mouth and then it\'s\r\neaten."\r\n\r\nAll the boys drew a deep horrified breath. The old man nodded heavily.\r\n"Well," he said, "how were we to know these beings from outer space had\r\nevolved from pigs, or creatures very similar?" He sighed, and stood\r\nup. "Well, maybe in fifty years they\'ll feel we\'re advanced enough for\r\nfreedom." He smiled. "I\'ll leave you to your telepathy classes and\r\nconditioning."\r\n\r\nHe moved toward the door and a portion of glass wall slid aside to let\r\nhim through. 

But before he exited he turned and said softly, "Now don\'t\r\nlet it get you, boys. Being exhibited in a zoo isn\'t too bad. Serve\r\nyour time and you\'ll get servant status like me and get out into space."\r\n\r\nHe waved and walked out through the spectators gathered around the\r\nglass cage. They moved aside to let him through, staring at him with\r\nbrilliant brown eyes, their snoutlike noses twitching in sympathy and\r\nkindness, their pig-like faces gentle with the expression a man gives a\r\ntrained dog.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAlone within the humming ship, deep in its honeycombed metal chambers,\r\nMurdock waited for death. While the rocket moved inexorably toward\r\nEarth--an immense silver needle threading the dark fabric of space--he\r\nwaited calmly through the final hours, knowing that the verdict was\r\nabsolute, that hope no longer existed.\r\n\r\nElectronically self-sufficient, the ship was doing its job perfectly,\r\nthe job it had been built to do. After twenty years in space, the ship\r\nwas taking Robert Murdock home.\r\n\r\nHome. Earth. Thayerville, a small town in Kansas. Clean air, a shaded\r\nstreet, and a white, two-story house at the end of the block.\r\nHome--after two decades among the stars.\r\n\r\nSitting quietly before the round port, seeing and not seeing the\r\nendless darkness surrounding him, Murdock was remembering.\r\n\r\nHe remembered the worried face of his mother, her whispered prayers for\r\nhis safety as he mounted the rocket ramp those twenty years ago; he\r\ncould still feel the final, crushing handshake of his father moments\r\nbefore the outer airlock slid closed. His mother had been 55 then, his\r\nfather 63. It was almost impossible to believe that they were now old\r\nand white-haired.\r\n\r\nAnd what of himself?\r\n\r\nHe was now 41, and space had weathered him as the plains of Kansas\r\nhad weathered his father. He, too, had labored as his father had\r\nlabored--but on strange, alien worlds, under suns far hotter than Sol.\r\nMurdock\'s face was square and hard-featured, his eyes dark and deep\r\nunder thrusting ledges of bone. He had changed as they had changed.\r\n\r\nHe was a stranger going home to strangers.\r\n\r\nCarefully, Murdock unfolded his mother\'s last letter, written in her\r\nflowery, archaic hand, and received just before Earth take-off.\r\n\r\n    _Dearest Bob,_\r\n\r\n    _Oh, we are so excited! Your father and I listened to your voice\r\n    on the tape over and over, telling us that you are coming home to\r\n    us at last. We are both so eager to see you, son. As you know, we\r\n    have not been too well of late. Your father\'s heart does not allow\r\n    him out much any more, and I have had a few fainting spells over\r\n    the past month. But Doctor Thom says that we are all right, and you\r\n    are_ not _to worry. Just hurry home to us, Bob. We both pray\r\n    God you will come back safely._\r\n\r\n                                                         _All our love,\r\n                                                                Mother_\r\n\r\nRobert Murdock put the letter aside and clenched his fists. Only brief\r\nhours remained to him, and the small Kansas town of Thayerville was an\r\nimpossible distance across space. He knew he would never reach it alive.\r\n\r\nThe lines of an ancient poem by Robert Frost whispered through his mind:\r\n\r\n    But I have promises to keep,\r\n    And miles to go before I sleep\r\n\r\nHe had promised his parents that he would come home--and he meant to\r\nkeep that promise.\r\n\r\nThe doctors had shown him that it was impossible. They had charted his\r\ndeath; they had told him when his heart would stop beating, when his\r\nbreathing would cease. Death, for Robert Murdock, was a certainty. His\r\nalien disease was incurable.\r\n\r\nBut they had listened to his plan. They had listened, and agreed.\r\n\r\nNow, with less than a half-hour of life remaining, Murdock was walking\r\ndown one of the ship\'s long corridors, his boot-heels ringing on the\r\nnarrow metal walkway.\r\n\r\nHe was ready, at last, to keep his promise.\r\n\r\nMurdock paused before a wall storage locker, twisted a small dial.\r\nA door slid smoothly back. He looked up at the tall man standing\r\nmotionless in the darkness. Reaching forward, Murdock made a quick\r\nadjustment.\r\n\r\nThe tall man stepped down into the corridor, and the light flashed in\r\nhis deep-set eyes, almost hidden behind thrusting ledges of bone. The\r\nman\'s face was hard and square-featured.\r\n\r\n"My name is Robert Murdock," said the tall figure in the neat patrol\r\nuniform. "I am 41 years of age, a rocket pilot going home to Earth." He\r\npaused. 

"And I am sound of mind and body."\r\n\r\nMurdock nodded slowly. "Indeed you are," he said.\r\n\r\n"How much longer do you have, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Another ten minutes. Perhaps a few seconds beyond that," replied\r\nMurdock.\r\n\r\n"I--I\'m sorry," said the tall figure.\r\n\r\nMurdock smiled. He knew that a machine, however perfect, could not\r\nexperience the emotion of sorrow, but it eased him to hear the words.\r\n\r\nYou will be fine, he thought. You will serve well in my place and my\r\nparents will never suspect that their son has not come home to them.\r\n\r\n"It must all be perfect," said Murdock.\r\n\r\n"Of course," said the machine. "When the month I am to spend with them\r\nis over they\'ll see me board a rocket for space--and they\'ll understand\r\nthat I cannot return to them for another twenty years. They will accept\r\nthe fact that a spaceman must return to the stars, that he cannot leave\r\nthe service before he is 60. Let me assure you, sir, it will all go\r\nwell.

"\r\n\r\nYes, Murdock told himself, it _will_ go well; every detail has been\r\nconsidered. My voice is his voice, my habits his own. The tapes I have\r\npre-recorded will continue to reach them at specified intervals until\r\ntheir death. They will never know I\'m gone.\r\n\r\n"Are you ready now, sir?" the tall figure asked gently.\r\n\r\nMurdock drew in his breath. 

"Yes," he said, "I\'m ready now."\r\n\r\nAnd they began to walk down the long corridor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMurdock remembered how proud his parents had been when he was finally\r\naccepted for Space Training--the only boy in Thayerville to be chosen.\r\nBut then, it was only right that he should have been the one. The other\r\nboys, those who failed, had not _lived_ the dream as he had lived it.\r\nFrom the moment he\'d watched the first moon rocket land he had known,\r\nbeyond any possible doubt, that he would become a rocketman. He had\r\nstood there, in that cold December of 1980, a boy of 12, watching the\r\ngreat rocket fire down from space, watching it thaw and blacken the\r\nfrozen earth. He had known that he would one day follow it back to the\r\nstars, to vast and alien horizons, to worlds past imagining.\r\n\r\nHe remembered his last night on Earth, twenty long years ago, when\r\nhe had felt the pressing immensity of the vast and terrible universe\r\nsurrounding him as he lay in his bed. He remembered the sleepless hours\r\nbefore dawn, when he could feel the tension building within the single\r\nroom, within himself lying there in the heated stillness of the small,\r\nwhite house. He remembered the rain, near morning, drumming the roof,\r\nand the thunder roaring powerfully across the Kansas sky. And then,\r\nsomehow, the thunder\'s roar blended into the deep atomic roar of a\r\nrocket, carrying him away from Earth, away to the burning stars ...\r\naway ...\r\n\r\n_Away._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe tall figure in the neat patrol uniform closed the outer airlock\r\nand watched the body drift into blackness. The ship and the android\r\nwere one; two complex and perfect machines doing their job. For Robert\r\nMurdock, the journey was over, the long miles had come to an end.\r\n\r\nNow he would sleep forever in space.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the rocket landed, the crowds were there, waving and shouting out\r\nMurdock\'s name as he appeared on the silver ramp. He smiled and raised\r\nhis hand in salute, standing there tall in the sun, his splendid dress\r\nuniform reflecting the light in a thousand glittering patterns.\r\n\r\nAt the far end of the ramp two figures waited. An old man, bowed and\r\ntrembling over a cane, and a seamed and wrinkled woman, her hair\r\nblowing white, her eyes shining.\r\n\r\nWhen the tall spaceman reached them they embraced him feverishly,\r\nclinging tight to his arms.\r\n\r\nTheir son had returned. Robert Murdock had come home from space.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Well," said a man at the fringe of the crowd, "there they go."\r\n\r\nHis companion sighed and shook his head. 

"I _still_ don\'t think it\'s\r\nright somehow. 

It just doesn\'t seem right to me."\r\n\r\n"It\'s what they wanted, isn\'t it?" asked the other. "It\'s what they\r\nwrote in their wills. They vowed their son would never come home to\r\ndeath. In another month he\'ll be gone anyway. 

Back for another twenty\r\nyears. 

Why ruin it all for him?" The man paused, shading his eyes\r\nagainst the sun. "And they _are_ perfect, aren\'t they? He\'ll never\r\nknow."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you\'re right," nodded the second man. 

"He\'ll never know."\r\n\r\nAnd he watched the old man and the old woman and the tall son until\r\nthey were out of sight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


Vaguely, he could sense--"remember" was too\r\ndefinite--much tugging and hauling upon his supine body. It doubtless\r\nseemed justifiable, but he flinched from recalling more clearly that\r\nwhich must have been so extremely unpleasant.\r\n\r\nGently, now, he tried rolling his head a few inches right, then left.\r\nWhen it hurt only one-tenth as much as he feared, he let his eyes\r\nopen.\r\n\r\n"Hel-lo!" rasped the bulbous creature squatting beside his pallet.\r\n\r\nCharlie shut his eyes quickly, and very tightly.\r\n\r\nSomething with a dampish, spongy tip, probably one of the grape-red\r\ntentacles he had glimpsed, prodded his shoulder.\r\n\r\n"_Hel-lo!_" insisted the scratchy voice.\r\n\r\nCharlie peeped warily, was trapped at it, and opened his eyes\r\nresignedly.\r\n\r\n"Where\'n\'ell am I?" he inquired.\r\n\r\nIt sounded very trite, even in his confused condition. Sections of the\r\ndark red skin before him, especially on the barrel-shaped belly,\r\nquivered as he spoke.\r\n\r\n"Surely," grated the remarkable voice, "you remember something?"\r\n\r\n"The crash!" gasped Charlie, sitting up abruptly.\r\n\r\nHe held his breath, awaiting the knifing pain it seemed natural to\r\nexpect. When he felt none, he cautiously fingered his ribs, and then a\r\nhorrid thought prompted him to wiggle his bare toes. Everything seemed\r\nto be in place.\r\n\r\nHe lay in a small room, on a thin pallet of furs. Floor and walls of\r\nslick, ocher clay reflected the bright outside light pouring through a\r\nwide doorway.\r\n\r\n"What\'s all the sand?" he demanded, squinting at the heatwaves\r\noutside.\r\n\r\n"You do not recognize it? 

Look again, Earthman!"\r\n\r\n_Earthman!_ thought Charlie. _It must be real: I can still see him.\r\nWhat a whack on the head I must have got!_\r\n\r\n"You are in pain?" asked the creature solicitously.\r\n\r\n"Oh ... no. 

Just ... I can\'t remember. The crash ... and then--"\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes. You have not been conscious for some time." His reddish host\r\nrippled upward to stand more or less erect upon three thick tentacles.\r\n"Even with us, memory is slow after shock. And you may be uneasy in\r\nthe lighter gravity."\r\n\r\n_Light gravity!_ reflected Charlie. _This can only mean--MARS! Sure!\r\nThat must be it--I was piloting a rocket and cracked up somewhere on\r\nMars._\r\n\r\nIt felt right to him. He decided that the rest of his memory would\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\n"Are you able to rise?" asked the other, extending a helpful\r\ntentacle.\r\n\r\nThe Earthman managed to haul himself stiffly to his feet.\r\n\r\n"Say, my name is Holmes," he introduced himself dizzily.\r\n\r\n"I am Kho Theki. In your language, learned years since from other\r\nspacemen, I might say \'Fiery Canalman.\'"\r\n\r\n"_Has_ to be Mars," muttered Charlie under his breath. "What a bump!\r\nWhen can you show me what\'s left of the ship?"\r\n\r\n"There will be no time," answered the Martian.\r\n\r\nBunches of small muscles twitched here and there across the front of\r\nhis round, pudgy head. Charlie was getting used to the single eye,\r\nhalf the size of an orange and not much duller. With imagination, the\r\nvarious lumps and organs surrounding it might be considered a face.\r\n\r\n"The priestesses will lead the crowd here," predicted Kho. "They know\r\nI took an Earthman, and I fear they have finished with the others.

"\r\n\r\n"Finished with--_What_?" demanded the Earthman, shaking his head in\r\nhopes of clearing it enough to figure out what was wrong.\r\n\r\n"It has been an extremely dry season." Kho rippled his tentacles and\r\nmoved lissomely to the doorway, assuming a grotesquely furtive posture\r\nas he peered out. "The people are maddened by the drought. The will be\r\naroused to sacrifice you to the Canal Gods, like the others who\r\nsurvived."\r\n\r\n"Canal gods!" croaked Charlie. "This can\'t be right! 

Aren\'t you\r\ncivilized here? I can\'t be the only Earthman they\'ve seen!"\r\n\r\n"It is true that Earthmen are perfectly safe at most times."\r\n\r\n"But the laws! The earth consul--"\r\n\r\nKho snapped the tip of a tentacle at him.\r\n\r\n"The canals are low. You can feel the heat and dryness for yourself.\r\nThe crowds are inflamed by temple prophecies. And then, your ship,\r\nflaming down from the skies--"\r\n\r\nHe snapped all this tentacle tips at once.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom somewhere outside, a threatening murmur became audible. It was an\r\nunholy blend of rasping shouts and shriller chanting, punctuated by\r\nnotes of a brassy gong. As Charlie listened, the volume rose\r\nnoticeably.\r\n\r\nKho reached out with one tentacle and wrapped six inches about the\r\nEarthman\'s wrist. When he plunged through the doorway, Charlie\r\nperforce went right with him.\r\n\r\nWhipping around a corner of the hut, he had time for a quick squint at\r\nthe chanters. Kho alone had looked weirdly alien. Two hundred like\r\nhim--!\r\n\r\nLed by a dozen bulgy figures in streaming robes, masked and decorated\r\nin brass, the natives were swarming over the sand toward the\r\nfugitives. They had evidently been busy. Above a distant cluster of\r\nlow buildings, a column of smoke spiraled upward suggestively.\r\n\r\nKho led the way at a flowing gallop over a sandstone ridge and down a\r\nlong slope toward what looked like the junction of two gullies.\r\n\r\n"The canal," he wheezed. "With luck, we may find a boat."\r\n\r\nA frenzied screech went up as the mob topped the ridge and regained\r\nsight of them. Charlie, having all he could do to breathe in the thin\r\nair, tried to shake his wrist loose. Now that they were descending the\r\nslope, he saw where the water was. They slid down a four-foot drop in\r\na cloud of fine, choking dust, and were faced by several puntlike\r\ncraft stranded on the mudflat beyond. The water was fifty feet\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\n"We should have gone down-stream," said Kho, "but we can wade."\r\n\r\nTheir momentum carried them several steps into the mud before Charlie\r\nrealized how wrong that was. Then, as they floundered about to regain\r\nthe solid bank, it became apparent that they would never reach it in\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n"They are catching us," rasped Kho.\r\n\r\nThe howling crowd was scarcely a hundred yards away. The heat waves\r\nshimmered above the reddish desert sand until the Martians were\r\nblurred before Charlie\'s burning eyes. His feet churned the clinging\r\nmud, and he felt as if he were running in a dream.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry you\'re in it, too," he panted.\r\n\r\n"It does not matter. I act as I must."\r\n\r\nThe Earthman rubbed sweat from his eyes with the back of a muddy\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n"Everything is wrong," he mumbled. "I still can\'t remember cracking up\r\nthe ship. Why did I always want to be a rocket pilot? Well ... I made\r\nmy bed!

"\r\n\r\nThe oncoming figures wavered and blurred in the heat. Kho emitted a\r\ngrating sound reminiscent of an Earthly chuckle.\r\n\r\n"As do all you mortals--who finally have to lie in them," he rasped.\r\n"I will tell you now, since I can carry this episode little farther.\r\nYou have never piloted a spaceship."\r\n\r\nCharlie gaped at him incredulously.\r\n\r\n"You ... you ... what about the wreck?"\r\n\r\n"It was a truck that hit you, Charles Holmes. You have no more sense\r\nthan to be crossing the street with your nose in a magazine just\r\npurchased on the corner."\r\n\r\nWith some dulled, creeping, semi-detached facet of his mind, Charlie\r\nnoted that the running figures still floated above the sand without\r\nactually drawing near.\r\n\r\n"Are you--Do you mean I\'m ... d-d-d--?

"\r\n\r\n"Of course you are," grated Kho amiably. "And in view of certain\r\nactions during your life, there will be quite a period of--shall we\r\nsay--probation. When I was assigned to you, your reading habits\r\nsuggested an amusing series of variations. 

You cannot know how dull it\r\nis to keep frustrating the same old dreams!"\r\n\r\n"Amusing?" repeated Charlie, beyond caring about the whimper in his\r\ntone.\r\n\r\nThe mob was dissolving into thin smoke, and the horizon was shrinking.\r\n\r\nKbo himself was altering into something redder of skin but equipped\r\nwith a normal number of limbs, discounting the barbed tail. The\r\nconstant heat of the "desert" began, at last, to seem explicable.\r\n\r\n"For me a great amusement," grinned Kho, displaying hideous tusks.\r\n"Next time, I\'ll be a Venusian. You will lose again. 

Then we can visit\r\nother planets, and stars ... oh, we shall see a lot of each other!"\r\n\r\nHe cheerfully polished one horn with a clawed finger.\r\n\r\n"_You_ won\'t enjoy it!" he promised.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n


]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subway train announced its arrival with a screech of grating steel.\r\nThe man was shoved from the car onto the platform by the eight p.m.\r\ncrowd. The noise and the abrupt handling of his body brought him to\r\nawareness.\r\n\r\nNot that he had been asleep or unconscious. 

Although he might have\r\nbeen. He didn\'t know for sure.\r\n\r\nHe found it hard to concentrate, but soon a sign over the platform came\r\ninto focus:\r\n\r\n                               WESTBORO\r\n\r\nIt meant nothing to him. The second thing he became aware of did.\r\n\r\nAnother train had replaced his, and directly in front of him was\r\nan army of people, dispassionate towards everything but its one\r\nobjective--to get on.\r\n\r\nThey came at him all at once, forming a pushing, elbowing, cursing,\r\njarring mass of humanity. He glanced off one to collide with another.\r\nHe escaped the punishment by a lunge to one side which ended with a\r\ncrash to the cold cement floor.\r\n\r\nHe regained some semblance of steadiness on his feet and looked at the\r\nsign. It was still Westboro. It still meant nothing to him.\r\n\r\nHe was lost.\r\n\r\nWhat was worse, he couldn\'t remember where he was lost _from_.\r\n\r\nHe turned to walk, he didn\'t know exactly where, when he smashed into a\r\nlittle boy eating an apple.\r\n\r\nThe boy reacted in a strange manner.\r\n\r\n"Leave me alone, you dirty man, you," the boy said. He dropped his\r\napple and ran off. Scared.\r\n\r\nThe man flushed with embarrassment, but the boy\'s remark made him look\r\ndown at himself.\r\n\r\nHe saw a dirty man. Filthy. His white shirt--it had been white\r\nonce--was torn at the elbow and was covered with grime, his shoes at\r\nthe toes were white where the black polish had worn completely off, his\r\npants reflected no evidence of ever having been pressed and the right\r\nleg was ripped from the knee down.\r\n\r\nTwo girls in their teens passed and giggled.\r\n\r\nHe was aware that others had noticed him.\r\n\r\n"Hey, lookit the bum," a fat jolly-rover called out to his three\r\non-the-towning cronies.\r\n\r\n"Bum," the man thought, and reached to his back pocket.\r\n\r\nNo wallet. But not long ago he had one, he was sure, because the feel\r\nof its absence was there. 

Somebody must have taken it, or he might\r\nhave lost it. In that crowd or on the subway or before.... He couldn\'t\r\nremember where he had been before.\r\n\r\nThe feeling of not remembering seemed familiar, and he tried hard to\r\nthink. But there was nothing static in his mind that he could hold on\r\nto. His mind wasn\'t blank anymore, it was a jumble. He somehow recalled\r\nhe had been looking for his money. He fumbled through his other pockets.\r\n\r\nHe found a dirty handkerchief and two cents.\r\n\r\nThe feel of the coins brought everything back.\r\n\r\nQuickly he felt his pulse. It was slower than he had ever known it to\r\nbe. 

Sure, there were times before when ... but then the doctor always\r\nhad been nearby. And this time, the most serious time of all--he looked\r\nup at the Westboro sign--he was lost. Perhaps, up on the streets, he\r\nwould recognize something.\r\n\r\nHe began to take the stairs at a run, but his breath came too hard, and\r\nhe walked the rest of the way to the turnstile. The arm caught tight as\r\nhe started to go through and a sharp pain want through his groin.\r\n\r\n"That\'s the way you go _in_, pal," somebody offered, and the man winced\r\nat the few laughs he had drawn. He saw the exit sign and walked quickly\r\ntoward it.\r\n\r\nThe night lights were just ahead as he collided with a woman loaded\r\nwith bundles. They spilled. "Sorry," he said, leaving her to her\r\nindignation, and at a faster pace he walked outside into the cool night\r\nair.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe had stopped walking and was leaning against the door of the Inn of\r\nSix Horses, which proudly displayed its name and namesakes in blue and\r\nwhite neon.\r\n\r\nHe had recognized nothing.\r\n\r\nHe had tried getting to the doctor\'s by cab, but no driver would listen\r\nto him without first seeing the fare, even though he assured them all\r\nthat he could get it from the doctor.\r\n\r\nA policeman had told him to move along or suffer the consequences of a\r\nthick nightstick.\r\n\r\nA drugstore proprietor had answered his request to use the phone by\r\nthreatening to call the policeman with the thick nightstick.\r\n\r\nA dime. One dime!\r\n\r\nHe remembered his Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nMy kingdom for a ... horse? Six horses. Maybe, just maybe, at the Inn\r\nof Six Horses....\r\n\r\nA short man at the bar, composing one half of the clientele, was\r\ncalling the bartender\'s attention to the fact that the six horses\r\noutside outnumbered the customers.\r\n\r\n"Go to blazes," the bartender commented on the short man\'s observation.\r\n\r\n"I should," said the short one. "Then George here would be Uncas, the\r\nlast of the Mohicans, riding your six old white stallions."\r\n\r\n"How do you know they\'re stallions?" 

George said. He was lean, mean and\r\nweary, looking as if he had just returned from a hard day of peddling\r\nvacuum cleaners.\r\n\r\nThe door banged shut and three pairs of eyes focused on a dirty man.\r\n\r\n"Here comes a touch," said Pete.\r\n\r\n"Please," said the man, his voice shaky and weak.\r\n\r\n"Before you go into your act, pal," Pete said, "understand this: Nobody\r\ngets nothing free here, this ain\'t no mission or nothing. This is a\r\nbusiness like any place else.

"\r\n\r\n"A real thriving business," mocked Shorty.\r\n\r\n"Please, a dime, I need a dime, that\'s all I--"\r\n\r\n"A _dime_?" George laughed. 

"For what, a cup of coffee? This is a\r\nhigh-class place. Beer costs fifteen cents here."\r\n\r\nShorty joined in with a snort. "Maybe he wants to call his girl."\r\n\r\n"I _need_ the dime," the man said, leaning on the bar for support.\r\n\r\n"A matter of real life and death, huh?" George said.\r\n\r\n"Yes. Look ... here, I have two cents, you take them."\r\n\r\nPete looked suspiciously at the two coins. "We don\'t sell nothing that\r\ncosts two cents."\r\n\r\n"You take the two cents, but give me a dime. _Please._"\r\n\r\n"Sharp businessman," noted George.\r\n\r\n"This is rich," said Pete. "Do you really expect to _buy_ a dime for\r\ntwo cents?"\r\n\r\nShorty said, "He just noticed how well you\'re doing. 

He figures you can\r\nafford the loss."\r\n\r\n"Boy, it burns me up," said Pete. "These professional bums make more in\r\na week than I see in a month."\r\n\r\n"You keep talking that way, and this clown will want to buy your\r\nbusiness for the two cents," Shorty said. "Ain\'t worth it," George said\r\nand banged his glass down. "Fill it," he directed Pete.\r\n\r\nAs Pete turned, the man made a lunge for George\'s change on the bar.\r\n\r\n"Watch him," warned Shorty.\r\n\r\nGeorge needed no warning. He had seen the man eying his money, and he\r\nhad hoped for just such a move. With a right fist to the side of the\r\nman\'s head, George took revenge for a bad day\'s work.\r\n\r\nThe man lay very still on the floor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"What a paste," said Shorty, admiringly. "You could have killed him\r\nlike that."\r\n\r\n"He sure ain\'t doing much moving," said Pete, coming around the end of\r\nthe bar. "I\'d better take a look."\r\n\r\n"Man, I didn\'t hit him that hard."\r\n\r\n"Well, _man_, he sure asked for it," said Shorty. "And me and Pete will\r\nbe right here to tell the cops that the guy was a crook and tried to\r\nrob your money. Right, Pete?"\r\n\r\n"George, this guy\'s got no pulse," Pete said.\r\n\r\n"Watcha gonna do, George?" Shorty said.\r\n\r\n"Just shut up and wait a minute," Pete said. "I think he\'s trying to\r\nsay something.

"\r\n\r\nThe man\'s eyes pleaded with each of the three. His lips quietly formed\r\ntheir message:\r\n\r\n"Dime."\r\n\r\n"Wow, talk about persistence," said Shorty.\r\n\r\nGeorge looked at his change on the bar.\r\n\r\nHe picked up a dime.\r\n\r\n"Hey," said Shorty, "what are you doing?"\r\n\r\n"Shut up," said Pete. "George\'s money is George\'s money. What he does\r\nwith it is his business."\r\n\r\n"Look," George said, "I didn\'t mean to hit you so hard. I mean, I hit\r\nyou so hard my whole hand hurts. So here, you can have the dime, I\r\nwon\'t miss it."\r\n\r\nHe pressed the dime into the man\'s hand.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Holy cow," said Shorty. It was the first sound any of the three had\r\nmade after the man had left, fifteen minutes before.\r\n\r\nGeorge stared into the mirror behind the bar, seeking some mighty truth\r\nin his own reflection. "He says ... he says _Unbutton my shirt_, and\r\nthen...."\r\n\r\nGeorge fondled some coins in his hand. "Then he takes that crazy dime,\r\na plain old, regular, crazy dime...."\r\n\r\nPete poured himself a Scotch. "What kind of guy is it, anyway," he\r\nsaid, "who walks around with a slot in the middle of his chest that he\r\nputs dimes into?"\r\n\r\n"Yeah," said George, "and who _ticks_, yet?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n

]\r\n\r\n\r\nZurg thwirmed, and admitted to himself that he was uneasy. Arching his\r\nthorax, he unrolled his antennae slowly in a lazy gesture he hoped\r\nwould conceal the unseemly nervousness he felt now that the ship had\r\nswung into an orbit around the strange planet. When a commander briefs\r\nhis officers, he must radiate confidence and calm.\r\n\r\n"Companions, an historic moment has arrived," he began pompously, his\r\nantennae moving in the deliberate, stylized movements of the Court\r\nlanguage. "Below us lies the verdant expanse of the third planet, green\r\ngem of the heavens."\r\n\r\nAt this, several of his subordinates turned a rather puzzled yellow\r\naround their head orifices, obviously unable to understand a gesture\r\nof what he was saying. Only the second-in-command seemed unconcerned;\r\nhe knew from long experience that his commander would revert to common\r\nvernacular when he had finished the usual ceremonial preamble.\r\n\r\nZurg did so, noting the relieved hues of his officers as he continued:\r\n"As you all know, our scouts have reconnoitered this world on several\r\noccasions. But now the time has arrived to make an actual landing. In\r\nfact, companions, we are the vanguard of an invasion." 

Pausing to let\r\nthis register, he was pleased to see that none of the officers seemed\r\nto be suppressing thwirms. If anything, they were calmer than he was.\r\n\r\n"Not a great deal is known about the inhabitants of the planet,\r\nbut the dominant form of life, strangely enough, is mammalian, and\r\npossesses some intelligence. Her Majesty desires conquest without undue\r\ndestruction. 

As the Queen wills, her servants shall act."\r\n\r\nAll dipped their antennae at this formula, and watched in attentive\r\nhues as the commander went on to explain that due to the high\r\npercentage of oxygen in the atmosphere, special coverings would have\r\nto be worn. They would filter the air before it reached the ventral\r\ntracheae, and leaving the head exposed, would shield all the rest\r\nof the body. A bit clumsy, the commander admitted, but absolutely\r\nessential.\r\n\r\n"Now as to our behavior toward the natives--previous experience with\r\nmammalian life-types shows that they are susceptible to panic and fear\r\nwhen confronted with something totally strange, so we will use tactics\r\nwhich basically are very simple. First, we will land near a native\r\nsettlement. When we march into the area, our alien appearance will stun\r\nthe natives. Our detachment of all-range telepathic sensitives will\r\nnotify us when the state of shock has set in, then our attack support\r\nwill open up with full-scale mental assault, and keep the creatures\r\nparalyzed while we seize the area before a defense can be organized.\r\nThen the Grand Fleet will proceed here at top speed."\r\n\r\n"Remember that in this, as in all operations where the powers of the\r\ncollective mind are used, we must first trigger the enemy\'s reaction by\r\nphysical means, therefore nothing can be done until we _know_ that they\r\nare in the needed state of shock. Now are there any questions?"\r\n\r\nHow strange actually, mused the commander as he returned to his\r\ncubicle, that a race like his own, so gifted at pure mental contact\r\nwith other life-forms, should still use signals and colorations to\r\ncommunicate among themselves. The chafed spot on his left antenna was\r\npaining again after the exercise of the briefing. The report had said\r\nthat these mammalians were believed to converse through some kind\r\nof atmospheric vibrations.... Odd too, that mental warfare, refined\r\nand developed though it was, could still only be used against minds\r\nagitated by a specific physical stimulus. And that physical stimulus\r\nhad to be provided by the invaders appearing on the scene, and if\r\nnecessary performing the Dra, a series of dances and contortions so\r\nrepulsive to most life-forms that all thinking would fade into panic.\r\nHaving once thwirmed himself at a performance of the Dra, he hoped it\r\nwouldn\'t be necessary ... his musings were interrupted as the ship\'s\r\nlights flickered to orange, signalling hands to stations for planetfall.\r\n\r\nLeaving the con of the ship to his second-in-command, he shut himself\r\nin his cubicle and made preparations to be miserably sick, as he always\r\nwas during deceleration. Stroking the chafed spot on his antenna with\r\nthe smooth edge of his left forearm\'s prehensile claw, Zurg raised his\r\nmedicine kit in his secondary tentacles and snapped off the heavy lead\r\nseal with his jagged incisor mandibles. I wonder, he speculated, why\r\nalien races always find us so frightening....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe brilliant orange sun was high in the sky, but only a few filtered\r\nbeams penetrated to the sheltered copse where the slate-colored ship\r\nlay partially concealed by artfully placed vines and underbrush. Drawn\r\nup in three ranks beside the ship, only their heads protruding from\r\nthe loose-fitting coveralls, stood the detail picked to make the entry\r\ninto the native settlement. 

Zurg led them out through the underbrush\r\nbarrier they had thrown up the night before, and they emerged onto\r\na little-traveled dirt road leading off across the fields toward a\r\ncluster of buildings that marked the edge of town.\r\n\r\nNo creatures appeared as the invading column lumbered along. As they\r\nneared the edge of the settlement, Zurg, his antennae drooping slightly\r\nfrom the unusual heat, turned to remind the others: "Remember, the\r\nmental assault won\'t begin until we are well into the area and shock\r\nreaction is effected, so _stay in formation_ until I order otherwise."\r\n\r\nThere were still no natives in sight on the small side street by which\r\nthey entered town; but as they turned a corner and swung on to the\r\nbroad central thoroughfare, the commander saw that the street was\r\nclogged with natives, a great milling mass of them moving up the\r\nstreet in the same direction as his column, about a hundred yards ahead.\r\n\r\nFor a moment they didn\'t appear to notice the newcomers, but soon a\r\ngrowing number had turned and were gesturing excitedly to each other,\r\npointing at the approaching troop. Watching them anxiously, Zurg saw no\r\nevidence of panic.\r\n\r\nThe column kept moving, and the crowd began parting to let them pass\r\nthrough. Some darted forward as though to get a closer look at the\r\nstrangers. The commander fought off a thwirm as he realized the crowd\r\nwas now all around them, pressing in more closely on every side. The\r\natmosphere itself seemed to vibrate strangely, and looking around, he\r\nsaw that the creatures were opening small head orifices and striking\r\nthe ends of their forward limbs together. Were they communicating--or\r\nwas it something else? It was surely not panic.\r\n\r\nFeeling increasingly dizzy from the heat and vibrations, he glanced\r\nanxiously over his followers, and saw at once that they were more upset\r\nthan he. Colors were flushing their faces in meaningless successions.\r\nOne or two seemed to be staggering. The shock threshold of these beings\r\nhas been horribly underestimated, thought Zurg desperately. Only one\r\nthing left to do--turning again, he signalled the detail to begin the\r\nDra. Perhaps that would overcome this incomprehensible counterattack....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"I tell you Charlie, you\'ve got to discipline that gang! They didn\'t\r\nshow up on time, they didn\'t complete the route, they put on a\r\npublic ritual that wasn\'t scheduled, apparently stealing the entire\r\nshow--stupid crowd yelled themselves hoarse. Then they all reeled off\r\ninto a side street. They must have been drunk to a man--I understand\r\nabout half of them had to be carried! _And_ when I confronted Andy\r\nSharpe, he swore up and down that they weren\'t out of their hotel that\r\nmorning. 

All sleeping off that spree they had the night before. He\r\nactually had the nerve to say, \'I don\'t know who those boys were that\r\nyou claim were a block behind the end of the parade, but they weren\'t\r\nour boys.\'"\r\n\r\nCharlie Dils, new Commander of the Illinois chapter of the American\r\nLegion, leaned back in his chair car seat and blew a cloud of cigar\r\nsmoke toward the ceiling. "Maybe they were men from Mars," he grinned.\r\nThen, remembering his dignity, he sobered abruptly. "Anyway, one bunch\r\nlooks about the same as another, once they get their masks on--good\r\nLord, it was a hot day for masks--but it certainly made the parade\r\nmore impressive. People are still talking about it. 

We\'re even getting\r\ncredit for having a flying saucer. Some farmer out at the edge of town\r\nclaims he saw one take off after the parade last night. Says it was\r\ngoing west like a bat out of hell.\r\n\r\n"If we can get that kind of publicity, Frank, I wouldn\'t worry\r\nabout Andy and the boys. I\'ll write him a letter. 

It was a great\r\nconvention--let\'s let it go at that."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the hour before dawn. In the middle of the night the big ship\r\nhad landed on the new planet, the satellite of the sun Proxima. Now\r\nthey sat in the dark waiting, and they talked.\r\n\r\n"I wish we hadn\'t killed them," Rossiter said softly. His profile was\r\nfaintly visible against the diffused light of the stars. "It\'s a bad\r\nsign, a bad start for a new life."\r\n\r\n"They attacked us," Bernard answered quickly.\r\n\r\n"Two spears, against forty blasters and stun guns?" Rossiter laughed.\r\n"An attack! We should have met them with stunners at low charge. 

But\r\nMcNess ordered us to blast. The woman and the baby stick in my craw."\r\n\r\n"All our nerves were on edge," Bernard answered thoughtfully. "I know I\r\nwas afraid when we first stepped out of the ship. There was something\r\nterrifying about air, and space, and the sky. 

But you\'re right, of\r\ncourse. We shouldn\'t have been ordered to blast." The two men were\r\nsitting a little apart, but there was a murmur of many low voices\r\naround them as the others from the _Elpis_ waited and talked.\r\n\r\n"I wonder why they attacked us?" Bernard went on. "Primitives usually\r\nrun. We must have been an unbelievable sight to them, spiraling down\r\nout of the sky."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," Rossiter replied wearily. "And we can\'t ask them.\r\nThey\'re dead, all five of them. That wind\'s cold." He was shivering.\r\n\r\n"You could go back inside the ship," Bernard said half-humorously.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sick of the _Elpis_. We all are. 

Eight years of it--it\'s too much.\r\nWe\'ll get used to the wind, I suppose. There\'s going to be lots of\r\nwind, with so much water and only this one land mass on our new world.\r\nIt\'s not like Earth."\r\n\r\nBernard made an involuntary movement. Then he relaxed. "I suppose the\r\ntaboo is lifted now that we\'ve landed," he said heavily. "We can talk\r\nabout Earth again, and wonder, and speculate. I wonder what they\'re\r\ndoing now on Earth."\r\n\r\n"Starving. Freezing. Burrowing into the ground for coal and warmth.\r\nThey must be living a good many hundred feet down now, those that are\r\nleft. And the seas are frozen. There\'s an ice sheet from pole to pole.\r\n\r\n"We astronomers paid you back finely, didn\'t we, Bernard, for all\r\nthe appropriations you got us in committee meeting. You were always\r\ngenerous with us and the physicists. But when the catastrophe happened,\r\nthe mystery, the debacle, we couldn\'t help. We didn\'t know the answer.\r\nWe didn\'t know."\r\n\r\n"I remember--" Bernard answered, choking a little, "--I remember the\r\nday before it happened. There was a report on my desk about some tribe\r\nof Indians high in the Andes. The report said that the parents had been\r\npersuaded to send their children to the school in the foothills, that\r\neven among the adults illiteracy and ignorance were being eliminated.\r\nIt was the last of the ignorant tribes.\r\n\r\n"I looked up at the sign over my desk and read the motto, \'There\r\nis nothing unknowable. There are only things not yet known,\' and I\r\nthought, \'Yes, we\'re getting near our goal. We\'ve conquered ignorance\r\nand superstition and illiteracy. And as time goes on we\'ll know more\r\nand more things. The area of the unknown will constantly diminish.\r\nKnowledge is like an expanding circle of light that eats into the\r\ndarkness.\' Then the darkness came. And you didn\'t know."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"We know what happened well enough," Rossiter corrected. He sounded\r\nolder than his fifty-two years. "I was at the observatory that night.\r\nI remember thinking that it was almost time for me to go to the\r\ndormitory to sleep. It was summer; Sirius and the sun would both soon\r\nbe up. Sirius rose, blazing in the darkness, and after him Leo, in the\r\nsoutheast. It should have been invisible in the sunlight. I couldn\'t\r\nbelieve what I saw. And still the sun didn\'t come up.\r\n\r\n"We know what happened in a way. We don\'t know how or why. The sun, our\r\nsun, never rose. The sun just disappeared."\r\n\r\n"How softly everyone\'s speaking," Bernard said irrelevantly. "It\'s the\r\nsky and the darkness. I could hardly hear you." He got to his feet.\r\n\r\n"Where are you going, Tom?" Rossiter asked.\r\n\r\n"I want to look at the bodies. The people we blasted, I mean."\r\n\r\n"That\'s morbid. Don\'t go, Tom. Stay here."\r\n\r\n"But I want to go. I\'ll be back." He moved away through the dimly\r\nvisible outlines of men and women seated on the ground.\r\n\r\nHe came back after a while and sat down by his friend in silence. "I\r\nthink I know why they attacked us," he said after a pause.\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"I think we interrupted some magical or religious rite. They were at\r\na very low level of material culture, of course. The points on the\r\nspears were stone, and they were wearing garments of what looked like\r\nsome sort of tree bark. 

Not woven cloth. But the young men were wearing\r\nrattles of some sort of shell around their ankles, and the old man was\r\nholding a little drum in his hands.\r\n\r\n"You see, they had a good cranial capacity. As soon as human beings can\r\nthink at all, they start trying to impose their will on the universe.\r\nI think they met here by the shore to perform some sort of magic. The\r\nwoman and the baby watched, the old man played his drum, the two young\r\nmen sang and danced. Perhaps this bit of the coast was sacred to them.\r\nPerhaps, when we set our ship down here, we profaned a sacred place."\r\n\r\n"The woman and the baby bother me," Rossiter said thoughtfully. "It\r\nseems a dreadful thing to me to kill a woman. Ever since Kate died...."\r\n\r\nBernard rested his hand for a moment on the older man\'s shoulder in\r\nsympathy. "It was wrong. 

We shouldn\'t have done it," he responded. "But\r\nwe must forget it. 

Tomorrow, when it\'s light, we\'ll bury them."\r\n\r\n"I wonder if they were the only humanoid life on the planet," Rossiter\r\nsaid, pursuing his own train of thought "This island was the only land\r\nmass we found anywhere. If those five, so few.... When we blasted them,\r\ndid we wipe out the planet\'s native humanoid life?"\r\n\r\n"Possibly," Bernard admitted uneasily. He cleared his throat. "If they\r\nhadn\'t attacked us we could have helped them. They were primitive,\r\nsuperstitious, blankly ignorant, of course. But they had good\r\nskulls. They could have learned. We\'d have taught them, as we did\r\nthe primitives on Earth. We\'d have led them gently away from their\r\nsuperstition and ignorance. As we did on Earth. 

Let\'s not talk about it\r\nany more."\r\n\r\nRossiter made a sort of noise. Bernard leaned forward quickly. "What\'s\r\nthe matter, Dick? 

Are you all right?"\r\n\r\n"I--what you said--" Rossiter seemed to grope for words. "Be quiet a\r\nminute, Tom. I want to think. What you said then--I--it--" He laid his\r\nhands over his eyes.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll get Dr. Ferguson," Bernard offered.\r\n\r\n"No, I\'m all right." Once more he fumbled for words. "I\'ve suddenly\r\ncome to understand. You made me understand--_as we did on Earth_."\r\n\r\n"What--"\r\n\r\nRossiter got to his feet. In his normal voice, which sounded very loud\r\nin the darkness, he said, "I know what made the sun go out."\r\n\r\nThe murmur of low talking ceased suddenly. 

There was a sense of\r\nlistening, of half-seen bodies leaning forward intently in the\r\nstarlight. Rossiter said, "On Earth there was always somebody dancing."\r\n\r\n"Dancing? I don\'t see--" Bernard spoke in wonderment, but there was an\r\nodd, apprehensive note in his voice.\r\n\r\n"There was always somebody dancing," said Rossiter. He halted. Then he\r\ncontinued in a stronger voice, "Always, in the high mountains there was\r\nsomebody fasting and praying. Always before dawn there was the sound of\r\nthe rattles and the stamping footsteps.\r\n\r\n"In the winter the flame leaped high on the rock through the swirls of\r\nsnow as they made fire magic. They danced. They prayed. They chanted.\r\nAnd the sun came up."\r\n\r\n"What are you trying to say?" Bernard demanded. He had risen and was\r\nstanding facing the older man.\r\n\r\n"That people used to think, before we taught them better, that they had\r\nsomething to do with the sun\'s rising. They grew too wise to believe\r\nit any longer. 

But who knows? Who knows whether they were not right?\r\nWhether the force that impels the stars is not, finally, the human\r\nwill?"\r\n\r\nThere was a silence. 

Somebody laughed nervously.\r\n\r\nDr. Ferguson had already stepped forward and was holding Rossiter by\r\nthe elbow. Together, he and Bernard urged the older man toward the\r\n_Elpis_. They spoke to him gently. They did not argue or disagree with\r\nhim. They led him inside the ship.\r\n\r\nMuch later Bernard came out alone. Dr. Ferguson had remained with\r\nRossiter, quieting him with sedatives. It was still quite dark.\r\n\r\nBernard looked up at the sky, sighing. "How long the dawn is in\r\ncoming," he said, as if to himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


This was not strange because they\r\nquarreled often. But it bothered him after he\'d called for his car and\r\nwas on the way to his office, he realized she was the only one left.\r\n\r\nThe realization came suddenly and now he was frightened--this strange\r\nman who needed friends as a spider needs flies--in order to survive.\r\nHis wealth had drawn them of course; a fact he refused to believe.\r\nBut even unlimited resources could not hold them and insult and abuse\r\ndrove them all finally away. Yet he continued to insult and abuse while\r\npainfully seeing them leave. Because that was the kind of man he was.\r\n\r\nUntil now they were all gone, the dear ones, the relatives, even the\r\nfawners and he realized in panic that only Dolores was left.\r\n\r\n_But she will stay. There is no cause to worry. She will stay because\r\nshe loves me because she married me._\r\n\r\nBut he was nervous. He knew this quarrel had to be patched up because\r\nhe had too much at stake. And knowing only one way to patch a\r\nquarrel, he frowned and pondered. A gift of course, but what? 

She had\r\neverything. Another diamond necklace? Another ruby ring? Somehow he\r\nfelt neither would do the trick this time. The quarrel had been very\r\nbitter.\r\n\r\nThen he remembered and smiled and told his chauffeur, "There is a store\r\nI noticed in the International Building. Kamiss and Company. Stop off\r\nthere...."\r\n\r\nHe marched into the richly decorated showroom and said, "I\'m John\r\nGardner of Gardner Industries. I understand you\'ve got something new."\r\n\r\nThe clerk almost snapped his spine bowing. John Gardner! 

Mr. Billions\r\nhimself! If he could get him on the customer list it would be a\r\ntremendous prestige boost. "Indeed we have, sir. 

I imagine you are\r\nreferring to our new unit--_Domestic Two_?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what you call it, but it\'s the servant-robot you people\r\nhave spent millions publicizing. Will it actually do what you claim?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. Our advertising was underplayed if anything. You see, Mr.\r\nGardner, robots have been found quite satisfactory for assembling\r\nwork--manufacturing operations and the like, where they functioned as\r\nmere automatons."\r\n\r\n"I know," Gardner said coldly. "I use seven hundred of them in\r\nsmall-parts assembly."\r\n\r\n"But only now has Kamiss been able to individualize the robot and endow\r\nit with a real intelligence. The process involved a new sensitizer\r\nwe developed. This device is motivated by a micro-wave control\r\nindividualized to the unit itself. The result, Mr. 

Gardner, is basic\r\nintelligence and unswerving devotion. Each unit is--"\r\n\r\n"You talk too much," Gardner growled with his usual tact. "Trot one of\r\nthe things out and let me look it over."\r\n\r\n"Certainly sir," and the clerk scurried away, fearful of offending this\r\npowerful man.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA few moments later, the drapes parted and a robot walked into the\r\nroom. Gardner scowled at it. 

He was disappointed. "Rather tall isn\'t\r\nit?"\r\n\r\nThe clerk, following close behind the robot, said, "True, but its\r\ndimensions are the result of exhaustive scientific research. The height\r\nis nine-feet-three and one-quarter inches, the arm-span six-feet-two\r\ninches. The body and the appendages are well padded with our new\r\n_Vino-Live Plasticene_--almost a flesh-equivalent. The hands you will\r\nnote, sir, are absolute masterpieces of human ingenuity. The unit can\r\npowder a rock or pick up a pin. Let me demonstrate."\r\n\r\n"It\'s about time," Gardner growled.\r\n\r\nThe demonstration was spectacular. The robot took a one-inch steel bar\r\nin its hands and formed a loop. It threaded an old-fashioned sewing\r\nneedle, then picked up a fragile vase and moved it tenderly across the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nThe clerk beamed with justifiable pride. "Tell the gentleman your\r\nqualifications, Raymond."\r\n\r\nThe robot looked at Gardner through two blue electronic eyes and said,\r\n"I can perform any task a human servant can perform. And I will be more\r\ndevoted and loyal than a human servant could possibly be. Your commands\r\nwill be obeyed without question. Your wishes will always be fulfilled\r\nto the limit of my power. You and you alone will be my god."\r\n\r\nThe salesman coughed apologetically. "A little flowery, I\'m afraid, but\r\nour advertising and sales engineers demanded it."\r\n\r\n"Where does the voice come from?"\r\n\r\n"Another Kamiss innovation. An ultrasonic selector draws the words from\r\na storage wire attuned to--"\r\n\r\n"Enough chatter. I\'ll take one.

"\r\n\r\nThe salesman beamed. "Where would you like it delivered, sir?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll take it with me. I plan it as a surprise gift for my wife."\r\n\r\nThe salesman\'s smile vanished. "Then perhaps you could bring the lady\r\nhere to our establishment--"\r\n\r\n"No," Gardner scowled. 

"Why should I?"\r\n\r\n"As I was endeavoring to explain, sir, the units are, of necessity,\r\ncompletely individualized. The controlling factor is the electronic\r\nwavelength of the owner\'s brain. As you know, the frequency of every\r\nhuman brain varies. No two are alike. That is the key to the whole\r\nconcept of _Domestic Two_. We--"\r\n\r\n"Will you quit babbling and get to the point!" Gardner bellowed. "Tell\r\nme in simple words why I can\'t take the robot with me!"\r\n\r\n"Because, sir," the clerk answered in a frightened voice, "to be of\r\nany value to your wife, the unit will have to be keyed to her brain\r\nfrequency."\r\n\r\nGardner stomped the floor. "Then you\'ve wasted my time. We can\'t do\r\nbusiness. My wife would never come down here."\r\n\r\n"But the adjustment takes only a few minutes--"\r\n\r\n"We had a quarrel, you fool! She won\'t even unlock her bedroom door for\r\nme. The whole idea of this thing was something to surprise her out of\r\nher anger and bring about a reconciliation."\r\n\r\nGardner was striding toward the door. The clerk was frantic. This sale\r\nwould have got him Company recognition. In desperation, he hurried\r\nafter Gardner.\r\n\r\n"May I make a suggestion, sir?"\r\n\r\nGardner turned. 

"All right--make it."\r\n\r\n"It occurred to me that you might have the unit attuned to your own\r\nfrequency--temporarily, that is. You could present it to the lady, then\r\nat her leisure, she could call here and have the frequency changed to\r\ncorrespond to her own."\r\n\r\nGardner scowled. "Well, why didn\'t you say that in the first place?\r\nHow long does this adjustment take?"\r\n\r\n"Only a few minutes," the clerk, said eagerly. 

"If you will just step\r\nthis way, sir. Come Raymond...."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRaymond sat hunched beside the chauffeur who was a trifle nervous. But\r\nthe chauffeur hid his agitation because John Gardner paid well and\r\nhad been known to discharge chauffeurs who displeased him and leave\r\nthem standing on street corners without jobs. Gardner ordered him to\r\nturn and go back home. As they rode, Raymond stared straight ahead, a\r\npleasant light glowing in his blue eyes.\r\n\r\nWhen the car stopped under the portico, Gardner said, "Get out and open\r\nthe door, Raymond."\r\n\r\nThe robot said, "Yes, master," and obeyed instantly.\r\n\r\nThe chauffeur, shouldered aside by the robot, looked worried. Gardner\r\nnoted this and enjoyed adding to the man\'s discomfort: "Maybe they\r\nbuild one that can drive a car. In that case I won\'t be needing you\r\nmuch longer."\r\n\r\nInside, the robot gently lifted Gardner\'s coat from his shoulders,\r\nhung it in the closet, then returned to Gardner\'s side. "Have you any\r\nfurther wishes, Master?"\r\n\r\n_Aladdin\'s genie come true_, Gardner thought, and amused himself for\r\na few minutes putting the robot through a series of grotesque duties.\r\nAmazing! Perhaps he would get one of these units for himself also.\r\n\r\nThen he turned his mind to Dolores. She was no doubt still in her room.\r\nBut this new toy would make her forget their quarrel all right. He\r\nvisualized her laughing interest. He could already see her clapping her\r\nhands like the child she was and rushing into his arms.\r\n\r\nGardner turned to the robot. "Raymond, go up the stairs and knock on\r\nthe first door to your right. It is your mistress\' room. Tell her I\'m\r\nwaiting. 

Bring her to me."\r\n\r\nThe robot nodded and Gardner thought a look of adoration glowed in its\r\neyes. It said, "Yes Master," and moved toward the stairs.\r\n\r\nGardner sat down. He smiled to himself, anticipating the reunion.\r\nIt wasn\'t every wife whose husband could go out and buy her a\r\nthirty-thousand-dollar toy.\r\n\r\nThere was the crash of rending wood. The sound chilled Gardner, froze\r\nhim so that the angry scream that followed was anticlimax. But it\r\nbrought movement back into his legs and he lunged toward the stairs. He\r\nbellowed an order.\r\n\r\nToo late. The robot was already descending. It carried the dead body of\r\nDolores in its steel arms. Her head hung limply on a horribly twisted\r\nneck.\r\n\r\n"She refused to come, Master," the robot said.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               "I\'d give a year off my life to...." Idle\r\n             talk now, but it was ghastly reality to Kent!\r\n\r\n\r\nHoward Kent looked at his young and beautiful wife and felt the weight\r\nof the years rest on his shoulders. In her eyes he saw his heavily\r\nlined face and sagging, stooped shoulders.\r\n\r\nThey stood just inside the long, narrow reception room of the Human\r\nRejuvenation Plant. Potted palms and formal chairs reminded one of a\r\nHuman Disposal unit.\r\n\r\n"I have a confession to make, darling," he said.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, Howard. Not now. 

I take for granted you\'ve done the usual\r\nthings in your youth."\r\n\r\n"But...."\r\n\r\n"And we needn\'t have hurried so, as you can see. 

Now we\'ll probably\r\nhave to wait hours in this perfectly dismal place."\r\n\r\nShe looked as young and fresh as he looked old and dusty, he thought,\r\nso out of place in this kind of establishment.\r\n\r\nHe had always loved small women. Leah was small and vivacious and\r\ndressed a year ahead of styles. No matter what happened, he\'d never\r\nregret having married her.\r\n\r\n"But this is something I should have told you before," he said.\r\n\r\nShe put her hand on his arm. "I\'ve been perfectly happy these past six\r\nmonths. Whatever it was, I forgive you.

"\r\n\r\n"It\'s not that. I\'m talking about my age. I didn\'t think you\'d marry\r\nme if you knew how old I really was. I put off telling you and figured\r\nyou\'d see my birth certificate at the wedding ceremony."\r\n\r\n"I never even looked at the silly old thing."\r\n\r\n"Well, darling, I looked at yours and felt a little guilty in marrying\r\na young girl of twenty-three. But the fact is I\'m sixty-five. I\'ve been\r\nrejuvenated before."\r\n\r\n"I rather suspected it when you started aging so suddenly last week,"\r\nshe said. "Before that you didn\'t look a day over thirty. But it\r\ndoesn\'t matter."\r\n\r\n"It\'s worse than that, Leah." His face worked convulsively. "I\'ve been\r\nhere twice before. This is my third trip."\r\n\r\n"I\'m too modern to act shocked, Howard. If you didn\'t want to tell me\r\nbefore, dear, it\'s perfectly all right."\r\n\r\n"Look, darling!" Perspiration stood on his forehead. "You don\'t seem\r\nto understand. But then you never could add or subtract. 

Now listen\r\ncarefully. Each trip clips five years off your life span."\r\n\r\n"Everyone knows that, of course. But it\'s better to be young...."\r\n\r\n"It\'s better to be alive than dead," he said harshly.\r\n\r\n"But your doctors have given you a longevity span to the age of\r\nninety."\r\n\r\n"Suppose it was eighty, instead of ninety?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear, you worry too much," she said. "Doctors don\'t make such\r\nmistakes."\r\n\r\n"They can\'t give me a guarantee. You see, three of my ancestors\r\ndied from accidents. The prediction of ninety years is based on the\r\nassumption that they would have lived a normal life-time."\r\n\r\n"They make few guarantees. You know, all of you men are such babies at\r\na time like this."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but if it _is_ eighty--then, I\'ll come out not a rejuvenated man,\r\nbut just a handful of dust."\r\n\r\n"Oh, that can\'t happen."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Look at it this way." He paused a moment while taking in her youthful\r\nappearance. "From now on I wouldn\'t look much older. Just a little\r\ngrayer and perhaps more stooped. Then, I\'ll have what\'s left of my\r\nlongevity plus the five years this rejuvenation would clip off."\r\n\r\n"Why, Howard, dear." Leah sounded shocked. 

"You don\'t know what you\'re\r\ntalking about. An aunt of mine elected that choice and it was perfectly\r\nhorrible. She drooled the last few years of her life and was helpless\r\nas a baby."\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t they use Euthanasia?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"The courts decided she wasn\'t capable of making a rational decision."\r\n\r\nHe wiped his forehead. "That would be a long time off, darling. We\'d\r\nhave so much time together in the next fifteen years."\r\n\r\n"But what would it be like if you were crippled with arthritis or some\r\nother disease?"\r\n\r\n"You could divorce me if that happens."\r\n\r\n"I can also divorce you if you don\'t go through with rejuvenation. You\r\nknow it\'s the law."\r\n\r\n"You wouldn\'t do that." His face was more lined than ever.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be silly, dear. Nobody gets old these days. Who would remain our\r\nfriends? Why, everywhere we\'d go, people would point us out. 

Oh, no,\r\nlife wouldn\'t be livable."\r\n\r\n"That sounds like a cruel and calculating decision to me," Howard said.\r\n"Either I take a chance on dying or you\'ll divorce me."\r\n\r\n"You have no right to make such an accusation. I married a young man\r\nwho said he was thirty years old. Six months later I discover he\'s\r\nsixty-five. Now who\'s cruel and calculating?"\r\n\r\n"Please, darling, I didn\'t mean it. Look," he pleaded, "I\'ll even sign\r\npermission for you to have a lover. There\'s that young fellow that\'s\r\nalways around. 

Maybe it\'s happened already."\r\n\r\nShe stood back from him. "Howard, you\'re being perfectly nasty. Just\r\nlike an aged person you read about."\r\n\r\n"Five million dollars, and all of it yours when I die a natural death."\r\nHe put his hands in his pockets.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe street door opened just then and a young man came toward them with\r\na light springy step.\r\n\r\nHe offered his hand to Howard who took it slowly. "How are you,\r\nskipper? 

And you, Leah? I came as soon as I got your message."\r\n\r\n"He\'s worried, Mike." Leah\'s face had brightened. "And now he\'s\r\ninsisting on growing old."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been through the wringer twice before, you see," Howard said in a\r\nlow voice.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think you have much to worry about," Mike said. "Those medics\r\nknow their business."\r\n\r\n"Aging is a nasty process." Leah wrinkled her nose as if she smelled\r\nsomething offensive. "Maybe you can convince him, Mike."\r\n\r\n"Leah is right, you know," Mike said. "A few years ago I visited the\r\nold age home. There\'s only one left. You\'d be surprised at the amount\r\nof suffering old people go through before they die; cancer, angina,\r\nbroken bones, strokes, arthritis. Rejuvenation won\'t work on extremely\r\nold bodies. Longevity has run out."\r\n\r\n"Why does it have to clip off five years?" worried Howard.\r\n\r\n"It\'s the old-age governor they found in the pituitary gland. They can\r\nturn it back, but the shock takes off about five years."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I know what\'s in the medical articles," Howard growled. "Remember,\r\nI\'ve been through here twice before. But the Sun was so warm this\r\nmorning. It was like seeing everything for the last time. 

I felt like\r\nsitting down and letting everything drift."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a sure sign that you really need rejuvenating," said Leah.\r\n"After it\'s over you\'ll be making me a golf widow again. Won\'t he,\r\nMike?

"\r\n\r\n"Of course. He\'ll come out raring to go."\r\n\r\nHoward looked from Mike to Leah and back at Mike. Age was no match for\r\nyouth. If love hadn\'t started between them already, it would soon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the end of the long room, a door opened and two nurses entered,\r\nstarched and antiseptic.\r\n\r\n"Your room is ready, Mr. Kent," one nurse said.\r\n\r\nHoward shuddered. "Everything is so horribly familiar. The pill to\r\nerase the worry, which doesn\'t work. The cart you ride on which makes\r\nyou feel like a carcass. The little bump as you enter the regeneration\r\nroom. Then you get a hypodermic and crawl into a long boiler tank."\r\n\r\n"You\'re just nervous, dear," said Leah.\r\n\r\n"A dismal, miasmic cloud settles on your mind and you decide you\r\nwouldn\'t go through it again for anything in the world."\r\n\r\nMike put his arm around Leah as if it were the most natural thing in\r\nthe world. "He\'ll be all right, my darling."\r\n\r\nHoward looked at them and then turned wearily to the nurse. "I\'m ready."\r\n\r\nThe nurse walked down the long room with the stooped man and\r\ndisappeared beyond the door.\r\n\r\n"Did you tell him about us?" asked Mike.\r\n\r\n"Of course not. What a man doesn\'t know won\'t hurt him."\r\n\r\n"Are you Mrs. Kent?" asked the other nurse who had remained behind.\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"The doctor said to remind you that the fourth time is very dangerous,"\r\nthe nurse said. "You\'ll have five years and six months without it. 

But\r\npossibly only six months if it should be successful."\r\n\r\n"Better take the first offer, Leah," said Mike.\r\n\r\nLeah smiled. "I found a gray hair and a wrinkle this morning, love.\r\nBetter six months of youth than a thousand years of old age."\r\n\r\nShe went into his arms. "Don\'t worry about what happens, love. You\'ll\r\nhave a lot of fun in the next seventy years."\r\n\r\nHe kissed her and held her closely.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got to go now," she said. "I\'m so grateful you were able to get\r\nthe forged birth certificate."\r\n\r\nHer high heels tapped rapidly on the tile floor as she walked down the\r\nlong room with the other nurse.\r\n\r\n"Good luck, Mother," he called after her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe could remember the afternoon as if it were yesterday. It wasn\'t, of\r\ncourse--actually it had been several years back. 

It had been around the\r\nmiddle of autumn, about the time when the last incarnadine leaves were\r\nmaking their fluttering journeys earthward. He had taken his .22 and\r\ngone into the woods where the hickory trees were, and he had settled\r\nhimself comfortably against the shaggy trunk of one of the hickories,\r\nthe .22 balanced across his sprawled knees. Then he had waited.\r\n\r\nThe first red squirrel had come out on one of the high limbs and posed\r\nthere. That was the word all right--posed. It had sat there on its\r\nhaunches with utter immobility almost as if it had been painted on\r\ncanvas against a background of leafless naked branches and milk-blue\r\nsky.\r\n\r\nHe had raised the .22 lazily and sighted along the slender barrel.\r\nThere was no hurry. There was all the time in the world. He didn\'t\r\nsqueeze the trigger until he had a perfect right-between-the-eyes bead,\r\nthen he squeezed it ever so lightly. There was the sharp sound of the\r\nreport, and then the small body falling swiftly, bouncing and glancing\r\noff limbs, tumbling over and over, making a rustling thump in the dry\r\nleaves at the tree\'s base.\r\n\r\nHe hadn\'t even bothered to go over and examine it. He knew he\'d got it\r\nright where he\'d aimed. They didn\'t die instantly like that unless you\r\ngot them in a vital spot. They thrashed and kicked around after they\r\nhit the ground and sometimes you had to waste another shell on them if\r\nthe noise bothered you. Of course if the noise didn\'t bother you, you\r\ncould save the shell for the next one, but it was better in the long\r\nrun to get them right between the eyes because that way the others\r\nwouldn\'t be frightened away by the thrashing sound, and you didn\'t have\r\nto get up.\r\n\r\nThat had been the first one.\r\n\r\nThe second one had been coming down the trunk of the same tree,\r\nspiraling the trunk, the way squirrels do, stopping at frequent\r\nintervals and studying their surroundings with their bright beebees of\r\neyes, looking right at you sometimes but never seeing you unless you\r\nmoved. This one had stopped, head down, and was looking off to one side\r\nwhen he got it. The force of the bullet, striking just below the ear,\r\nwhere he\'d aimed, tore the small red body right off the trunk, spun it\r\naround several times, and dropped it into a wild blackberry thicket.\r\n\r\nHe hadn\'t bothered to look at that one either. He had lit a cigarette\r\nand leaned back more comfortably against the hickory. It was a pleasant\r\nafternoon, mild for November--a time for wandering in woods, a time\r\nto take it a little easy, a time to knock off some of the scavengers\r\nand pests you\'d neglected during the first days of pheasant and rabbit\r\nseason, a time to get your eyes down to hair-line fineness for the\r\nfirst ecstatic day of deer. Red squirrels were easy, of course, a\r\nlittle beneath the dignity of a true hunter, but when you tried to bore\r\nthem in vital spots you got some pretty good practice out of it.\r\n\r\nHe yawned. Then, out of the corner of his eye, he caught a red wisp\r\nof movement high in the tree to his right. He brought the .22 over\r\ncasually. He hardly needed to turn his body at all. 

The stock fitted\r\nhis shoulder snugly, lay cool against his cheek. There was no recoil,\r\nonly the sharp ripping sound, and then the dark red body falling,\r\nhitting limbs, caroming, dropping, dropping, making the familiar\r\nthrilling rustling sound in the dead leaves.\r\n\r\nThat had been the third.\r\n\r\nThe fourth and the fifth had been about the same.\r\n\r\nAfter the fifth, he had become a little bored. He decided to vary the\r\ngame a little. He drew his knees together and rested the barrel of the\r\n.22 in the niche between them, then sat there quietly for a long time.\r\n\r\nPresently the sixth squirrel left the security of the trees and made\r\na few quick jumps into the small clearing. Then it stopped and stood\r\npoised, a statuette except for its alive bright eyes. It was a perfect\r\ntarget, but he was in no hurry. He was enjoying himself immensely.\r\n\r\nAfter about half a minute the squirrel moved again--several yards\r\ncloser, almost in an exact line with the dark little eye of the .22. It\r\nsat up on its haunches then, its tail an arched question mark behind\r\nit. It put its tiny forepaws together and sat there not moving, almost\r\nas though it were praying. (That was the part he remembered most\r\nvividly.)\r\n\r\nHe\'d hardly needed to move the .22 at all. The slightest shift had\r\naligned the sights with the imaginary mark between the little eyes. He\r\nhad squeezed the trigger nonchalantly, and the part of the head just\r\nabove the eyes had come right off and the small red body had completed\r\na perfect somersault before dropping into the dead leaves of the\r\nclearing.\r\n\r\nAfter that he hadn\'t bothered with the trees. It was so much more fun\r\nin the clearing, waiting for them to come right up to you and pose. Of\r\ncourse it wasn\'t such good practice, but it was fine entertainment--an\r\nideal way to spend a lazy afternoon in fall when the wood was all cut\r\nfor winter, the crops in, the barn roof repaired and Pa off to town\r\nwhere he couldn\'t be finding annoying little things for you to do.\r\n\r\nHe had got eleven of them altogether, he hadn\'t missed a one, and he\r\nhad felt pretty proud taking them home to show to Ma before feeding\r\nthem to the dogs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe shifted his cramped legs and peered down through the interstices of\r\nthe foliage at the gray shape of the hunter. Some of his initial terror\r\nhad left him when he\'d finally realized that they couldn\'t see through\r\nleaves any more than he could; that They, as well as he, needed an open\r\ntarget in order to make a kill.\r\n\r\nSo he was relatively safe in the tree--for a while, at least. Perhaps\r\nhe could find safety in trees for the rest of his life. Trees might be\r\nthe answer.\r\n\r\nHe felt a little better. A portion of the fear that had followed the\r\nmeteor shower was still with him, however. The fear that had detonated\r\nin his mind the morning after the shower when Pa had come running to\r\nthe barn, shouting: "The cities! All the cities have been blowed up!\r\nThey ain\'t no more cities in the whole world. Radio just said so \'fore\r\nit went dead. We\'re bein\' invaded!"\r\n\r\n_Invaded?_ Invaded by whom? He hadn\'t been able to grasp it at first.\r\nAt first he\'d thought Russia, and then he\'d thought, no, it couldn\'t\r\nbe Russia. Pa had said _all_ the cities. All the cities in the whole\r\nwide world.\r\n\r\nAnd then he\'d begun to see the people on the road. The terrified\r\npeople, the walking, running, stumbling people heading for the\r\nhills--the hills and the forests, the hiding places that ships couldn\'t\r\nsee, that bombs couldn\'t find.\r\n\r\nBut that hunters could.\r\n\r\nHunters hunting with incredible silver guns, skimming along the roads\r\nto the hills and the forests in fantastic vehicles, alighting by\r\nroadsides and lumbering across fields to timber stands; routing out\r\nthe people from elms and oaks and maples and locusts and even sumac,\r\nflushing them out like rabbits and shooting them down in cold blood\r\nwith blinding shards of bullets.\r\n\r\nHe had run when he\'d seen the first vehicle. He\'d run wildly for the\r\nwoods. 

He\'d forgotten Pa and Ma. He\'d even forgotten his gun. 

He\'d been\r\nscared. Crazy-scared.\r\n\r\nWhat did They want to kill people for? What was wrong with people?\r\n\r\nHe shivered on the limb, in the chill morning wind that had sprung\r\nup after the first frost of the season. Martians, he\'d bet. Martians\r\nlanding on Earth and wanting everything for Themselves, afraid to let\r\npeople live for fear _they\'d_ get some. Greedy Martians, trying to hog\r\nthe whole world!\r\n\r\nThe gray shape below him moved slightly and his terror broke out\r\nafresh. The hunter appeared to be reclining against the trunk of a\r\nnearby tree, its gleaming weapon resting on its huge tentacular legs.\r\nWaiting. For an irrational moment he considered climbing down and\r\napproaching it, getting down on his knees and begging it for mercy.\r\n\r\nBut he\'d only be wasting his time. He realized that right away. 

He knew\r\nhe\'d see no pity in those cold inhuman eyes. He knew he\'d see nothing\r\nbut death.\r\n\r\nThe trees were the only answer. The trees with their friendly screens\r\nof foliage, their lofty leafy hiding places. By living in the trees\r\na shrewd man might be able to elude the hunters forever. If he was\r\ncareful. 

If he never let himself be seen.\r\n\r\nHe peered cautiously down at the hunter again. He looked at the gray\r\npatches of the gargantuan body that showed through the interstices of\r\nthe foliage.\r\n\r\nAs he watched, the first frost-nipped leaf fluttered down past his\r\nface, hovering for a moment before his eyes so that he could not miss\r\nits new autumnal coloring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\nOld Kelvin Martin strained futilely against the rope that held\r\nimmovable his thin wrists. A crimsoned bruise raced across his forehead\r\nwhere Vance had slugged him with a heavy hand.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be a complete fool, Vance!" he said harshly. 

"That machine can\'t\r\nbring you anything but trouble!"\r\n\r\nThe scientist\'s burly assistant glanced wearily up from where he\r\ncoupled heavy batteries in series at the rear of the glittering machine\r\nthat entirely filled one corner of the windowless room.\r\n\r\n"Shut up," he said tonelessly.\r\n\r\nKelvin Martin sagged back in sheer futility, felt a deadly numbness\r\ncreeping through his extremities from the tightness of his bonds. He\r\nwatched the other out of eyes faintly fearful and desperate.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll make a deal, Vance," he said finally. "I\'ve got about eight\r\nthousand dollars in the bank; free me, don\'t try to use that machine,\r\nand the money is yours!"\r\n\r\nJon Vance\'s laughter was brittle and scornful.\r\n\r\n"Eight thousand!" he sneered. 

"Hell, I\'ve seen those snapshots you\r\nbrought back! Any one of those gems the \'other people\' wore would bring\r\nthat. And I intend to bring back all I can carry!"\r\n\r\nKelvin Martin shivered, remembering the restless cruelty that had lain\r\nin the creatures he had found with his machine. There was still a dull\r\nache along his ribs where a needle-like ray of terrific energy had\r\nseared.\r\n\r\n"They aren\'t human, Vance." He tried to speak quietly, endeavored\r\nto drive his point with impersonal logic. 

"They are of a fierceness\r\nand cruelty such as you couldn\'t comprehend. And with their superior\r\nweapons, they\'d subjugate the entire world in a matter of days."\r\n\r\n"Hooey!" Jon Vance spat insolently, patted the .45 automatic at his\r\nhip. "I think I might do a bit of subjugating myself."\r\n\r\nHe tested the batteries.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know how it works, Martin," he said briefly. 

"But I don\'t\r\ncare, just as long as it makes me rich."\r\n\r\nOf course, Jon Vance did not fully understand the machine; even he,\r\nhimself, had trouble at times in comprehending the space-warping\r\npropensities of the machine he had built over a period of three years.\r\n\r\nHe knew only that the machine warped itself and its occupant into\r\nanother universe--a galactic maelstrom of whirling suns and gigantic\r\nplanets--onto a world where he had met a race of living beings that\r\nseemed to be super-endowed with unhuman hate and cruelty.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe felt the sickness of futility within him when he remembered the one\r\ntime he had invaded that other space. He had stepped from the machine\r\nand been greeted, cautiously but cordially, by those great-headed\r\nsuper-beings. For days he had been entertained and shown the weird\r\nsights of that alien planet. And it wasn\'t until he woke one night, to\r\nsee the curious machine hanging motionless over him, its pale blue aura\r\ncovering his sleeping couch, that he realized that he was being drained\r\nof his knowledge subtly every night.\r\n\r\nHe had raced from his sleeping room, fought with the single gun he had\r\ntaken with him, blasted his way through the screaming mob that tried\r\nto hold him captive. He had fought down the long stairs, through the\r\npalace door, and had fled into the night, pursued by the men who had\r\nprotested their friendship.\r\n\r\nWith his last bullet, he had killed the High-Priest, stepped over the\r\nprone body, and lurched into his machine. His fingers had flicked the\r\nlevers on the control panel; there was the instant hum of purring\r\npower--and then the machine had whisked him back to his own planet.\r\n\r\nHe had sat for hours in the machine, too drained of energy to move,\r\nknowing that only a miracle had saved his machine\'s secret from the\r\naliens that had planned to use it for an invasion of another space.\r\n\r\nBut now, because of the stupid greed of Jon Vance, because the man did\r\nnot realize the slavery and terror the aliens would bring to Earth, the\r\nmachine was gone--and he was a prisoner in the laboratory room.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe made one final desperate plea.\r\n\r\n"All right, Vance, if that\'s the way it is," he said tiredly. "But if\r\nanything goes wrong, destroy that machine; those monsters will use it\r\nto invade our system."\r\n\r\nJon Vance whistled thoughtfully, watching the scientist out of shiny\r\neyes, his heavy features drawn into a frown. Then he shrugged.\r\n\r\n"If things don\'t go as planned, maybe I can make a deal," he said.\r\n"After all, I always did think I\'d like to be a big shot.

"\r\n\r\n"You couldn\'t!" Sheer horror froze Martin into motionlessness.\r\n\r\n"The hell I couldn\'t!" Jon Vance stooped, edged through gleaming wires,\r\nseated himself at the machine\'s controls.\r\n\r\nHe twisted a rheostat, closed a switch, grinned at the supine\r\nscientist. Kelvin Martin said nothing more, but there was a grim\r\ndetermination replacing the panic in his faded eyes.\r\n\r\nA vacuum tube swelled with coruscating colors, and a nimbus of light\r\ngrew from a lacing of wires around the edges of the machine. There was\r\na dull throbbing in the close air, a rushing sense of the releasing of\r\nterrible, unknown power. A misty curtain seemed to be drawing tight\r\nabout the machine\'s outline.\r\n\r\nThen the machine was gone from its platform, and Kelvin Martin was\r\nalone in the great, bare experimental room.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKelvin Martin didn\'t move for seconds, then he struggled into a sitting\r\nposition. He fought the ropes with a silent doggedness that sent the\r\nhot blood pounding turgidly at his temples. His mouth gaped, as he\r\nstrained and twisted futilely, and the panic in his eyes was a terrible\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nThen he sagged limply, realizing that the ropes were too well-knotted\r\nfor him to release himself unaided.\r\n\r\n"God!" he prayed.\r\n\r\nHe drew his legs beneath him, shoved himself back until his shoulders\r\ntouched a side wall. Sitting there, he searched the room with feverish\r\neyes for any object with a cutting edge. 

His heart sank, when he saw\r\nthe bare sterility of the room. Without windows, without tools or\r\nfurniture, there was not a thing in the room that could be broken or\r\nused to sever the cutting ropes at his wrists.\r\n\r\nKelvin Martin sobbed deep in his throat, glanced at the door,\r\nremembering how Vance had locked it and pocketed the key.\r\n\r\nHe remembered the cigar lighter in his pocket, tried to fumble it out,\r\nwith the intention of burning his bonds. Dull horror pounded at his\r\nmind when he realized that his hands were completely numb, without the\r\npower of following the dictates of his mind.\r\n\r\nHe had no way of visualizing how long the treacherous Vance would be\r\ngone, no way of knowing whether the man would return victorious. But\r\nclear reasoning told him that the monstrous people of the other world\r\nwould slay Vance, then use Martin\'s machine as the doorway through\r\nwhich to pass their conquering hordes. Too, the machine would serve as\r\nthe model for more carriers.\r\n\r\nHe straightened at the thought, memory struggling for expression in his\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nHe followed the lines of the walls, leaning against them for support,\r\nedging forward with agonizing slowness by jumping his tied feet.\r\nPerspiration dotted his white face, and his thinning hair lay tight on\r\nhis small head, but slowly the smile broadened on his lips.\r\n\r\nAt last, he rested against the wall, then gently slid to a seated\r\nposition. He tested his bonds again, ceased the futile struggle almost\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nHe sat for a time, then lay back and stared at the ceiling. He thought\r\nof many things in those passing moments, thoughts of his dreams of\r\ngiving scientific miracles to the world, of having his bust in the Hall\r\nof Fame, of people he had known, and things he had done.\r\n\r\nRegret shadowed his memories, when he remembered things that he had\r\nleft undone and unforgiven. Then he shrugged a bit, lay breathing\r\nquietly, waiting for the machine to return.\r\n\r\nHe felt the sensation of released forces a few seconds before the\r\nmachine reappeared. He sat, drew his legs to his chest, scooted back\r\na few feet. He waited, content, wondering just what would happen. He\r\nwas smiling when the machine and its unhuman occupants whisked out of\r\nnothing into shadowy being. One glance they had of the smile on his\r\ntired face--then the very air seemed to explode with gigantic twistings\r\nand loopings of unleashed forces.\r\n\r\nFor Scientist Kelvin Martin had remembered one scientific fact from his\r\ncollege days. He had recalled that two material objects may not occupy\r\nthe same period of space.\r\n\r\nAnd sitting, bound, on the machine\'s platform, he had awaited the\r\ncoming of the Frankensteinian monster he had created.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s Doorway to Destruction, by Garold S.

Please answer." His voice grew more\r\nurgent. "Please pick us up! Our air supply is failing!"\r\n\r\nMatt shook his thick black head of hair. 

"If they fall for this,\r\nthey\'re stupider than I gave them credit for." His hand rubbed the gun\r\nhidden beneath his shirt.\r\n\r\nA fierce cone of light flared in the freighter\'s forward rockets,\r\nbrighter for an instant than the sun\'s remote disc.\r\n\r\n"They are falling for it, Matt," Henry exclaimed. A wide grin spread\r\nover his pudgy baby-face. "They\'re slowing down."\r\n\r\nThe radio receiver came to life. "Hello, survivors. We hear your\r\nmessage and are adjusting course to pick you up. Stand by."\r\n\r\nJake turned to his cohorts, a triumphant glint in his pale grey eyes.\r\n"I knew they would. What were you guys worried about?"\r\n\r\n"They don\'t like to," said Matt. "Costs them time."\r\n\r\n"Space law says they have to," said Henry.\r\n\r\n"Space law!" echoed Matt. "There isn\'t a space patrol within two\r\nhundred million miles."\r\n\r\n"Gosh, it\'s a big ship," said Henry. "Wonder what\'s in its cargo?"\r\n\r\n"Yeah, Jake. How about telling us now?"\r\n\r\nJake smiled with self-contentment. "I said it would be worth your\r\nwhile. 

Be patient a few minutes longer."\r\n\r\nThe cargo hold of the freighter opened. A rocket-propelled net shot out\r\ninto space. Their tiny unit was caught up like a fish and dragged into\r\nthe freighter\'s maw.\r\n\r\nThe first mate stood by as they clambered out of the unit.\r\n\r\n"We sure do thank you," said Jake to the ship\'s officer. "Another hour\r\nand it would have been too late."\r\n\r\n"Say," said Matt, "has your ship picked up any of the others?"\r\n\r\n"No," said the mate. "How many more were there?"\r\n\r\n"Seven, I think. We had a ship about your size. How many are in your\r\ncrew?"\r\n\r\n"Eight altogether," said the mate. "Perhaps you had better tell the\r\ncaptain about your accident."\r\n\r\nHe led them to the bridge. It was a darkened compartment, with green\r\nluminescent control panel, and a great steel-glass turret overlooking\r\nthe universe. Dominating the scene was a huge, dramatic closeup of\r\nSaturn, girdled by its thin, tilted rings.\r\n\r\n"You are the captain?" said Jake to the grave elderly man at the\r\ncontrols.\r\n\r\n"I am. You are the survivors?"\r\n\r\nJake and his companions bared their guns.\r\n\r\n"Call your entire crew," said Jake, pressing the muzzle into the\r\ncaptain\'s side. "I want to see eight men in this room."\r\n\r\n"Ah," said the captain sadly. "So this is what our mercy stop has let\r\nus in for."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey marched the eight crew members to the ship\'s air lock.\r\n\r\n"Get in," said Jake.\r\n\r\n"Surely it is not necessary for you to kill us," said the captain. "Why\r\ndon\'t you set us adrift in a survival unit? Give us a fighting chance."\r\n\r\n"Space death is such a terrible way to go," said the first mate.\r\n\r\n"Get in," said Jake. "I haven\'t said anything about what I was going to\r\ndo with you."\r\n\r\nThe eight looked at one another, then slowly, apprehensively, entered\r\nthe air lock.\r\n\r\nMatt pushed the button closing the inner door. Henry pushed the button\r\nopening the outer door.\r\n\r\nEight bodies drifted in space.\r\n\r\nJake took over the freighter\'s controls.\r\n\r\n"You sure you can find your way to Japetus?" Matt queried. 

"That moon\r\nis just a glorified piece of rock."\r\n\r\n"No trouble at all. 

Remember when we landed there? I left our ship\'s\r\nradio on, sending out a carrier beam. We\'ll just follow it in on\r\ndirectional-automatic."\r\n\r\n"Hey, Jake," said Henry. "How about the cargo? I\'ve been looking over\r\nthe cargo manifest, and all it says is five thousand carboys of oxygen."\r\n\r\n"Oxygen?" said Matt, with rising concern. "When we were on Titan you\r\ntold us this ship contained something very valuable."\r\n\r\n"Yeah, Jake, what\'s the story?"\r\n\r\n"Calm down, you two. This oxygen cargo is the most valuable stuff in\r\nthe solar system right now."\r\n\r\n"Aw come on," said Matt. "All you have to do is breathe to get a lung\r\nfull of it. Is this some joke?"\r\n\r\n"Eight dead men aren\'t my idea of a joke," said Henry, a frown crossing\r\nhis pudgy features.\r\n\r\n"All right," said Jake. "This was top secret information on Titan.\r\nThere\'s been a bad leak in the city dome. They\'re losing tons of air\r\nevery day, and so far no one\'s been able to find the hole."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t hear anything about it when I was there," said Matt.\r\n\r\n"Of course not. The engineers have kept it from the colonists so there\r\nwouldn\'t be a stampede to get out. Because there aren\'t nearly enough\r\nships to evacuate everybody."\r\n\r\n"Then just where do we come in?" asked Henry.\r\n\r\nJake shook his head impatiently. 

"Can\'t you see? This is an emergency\r\nshipment of oxygen for Titan. Their reserves are just about gone. They\r\nfigured it would take about ten days to check the entire dome, but\r\nthey\'ve only got about three days\' supply of oxygen left."\r\n\r\nMatt nodded approvingly. 

"I\'m beginning to see it now. 

When that\'s\r\ngone, they\'ll pay any price to get more.

"\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got it," said Jake. "There\'s a Federation bank on Titan with\r\nassets of thirty million. We\'ll take every penny.

"\r\n\r\nHenry was worried. "Well, what if they find that hole before the three\r\ndays are up. Then we won\'t be in such a good bargaining position."\r\n\r\n"In that case," said Jake, his grey eyes flickering like chalcedony,\r\n"we\'ll make a new hole."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey landed on Japetus.\r\n\r\n"Now, one of us has to deliver the ultimatum," said Jake. "One of us\r\nhas to go back to Titan and tell them our terms."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t that pretty risky?" said Matt. "They\'ll hold that guy hostage."\r\n\r\n"No, we aren\'t doing it that way." Jake withdrew an envelope from his\r\ncoat. "We just get there and mail this registered letter to the city\r\nmanager. It says, deliver the money to Hyperion, and no monkey business\r\nor we destroy the oxygen. That means, the city dies if anyone tries to\r\ntail us or pull a double cross."\r\n\r\n"They won\'t take a chance when so many lives are at stake," said Henry.\r\n"And we\'ll each make ten million on the deal."\r\n\r\n"All right," said Matt. 

"Which of us goes?"\r\n\r\nJake cut up three slips of paper. "Let\'s draw lots," he suggested.\r\n"That\'s the fairest way."\r\n\r\nHenry drew the assignment.\r\n\r\n"Be sure to bring back some whiskey," said Matt. "We forgot to lay in a\r\nsupply."\r\n\r\nHenry took off for Titan.\r\n\r\nJake turned to Matt. "Look," he said, "I arranged it so Henry would\r\ntake the letter because I wanted to talk to you. When you come right\r\ndown to it, Matt, what need do we have for three people in the deal?"\r\n\r\nMatt slowly nodded his thick black head of hair, as comprehension\r\nspread over his features.\r\n\r\n"With just two people to divide up the pot, our shares would be fifteen\r\nmillion apiece," said Jake.\r\n\r\n"And less chance of getting caught afterwards," Matt added.\r\n\r\nThey shook hands.\r\n\r\nHenry returned from Titan eight hours later.\r\n\r\n"I mailed the letter," he said. "And I bought the whiskey."\r\n\r\n"Good," said Matt, "pour us all a drink."\r\n\r\nHenry started to uncork the bottle. Jake and Matt reached for their\r\nguns and shot him simultaneously. A look of bewilderment crossed his\r\nbaby face as he fell dead.\r\n\r\nThe whiskey bottle tipped over, but Matt retrieved it quickly, before\r\nmore than half had spilled. With an amused look at the dead partner, he\r\nlifted the bottle to his lips and took a deep swig.\r\n\r\nMatt handed the bottle to Jake, who drank several ounces. But his\r\nenjoyment was interrupted by a bleating sound from the ship\'s\r\nproximity alarm.\r\n\r\n"There\'s another ship nearby!" said Jake in alarm.\r\n\r\nA rocket ship appeared suddenly overhead.\r\n\r\n"That\'s a police ship from Titan!" Matt exclaimed. "But how on Saturn\r\ncould they have known we were here?"\r\n\r\n"They must have trailed Henry. That stupid fool probably took his time\r\nabout buying the whiskey, and the letter got delivered before he left\r\nTitan!"\r\n\r\nHe strode to the ship\'s radio.\r\n\r\n"It won\'t do them any good, though. I\'ll tell \'em I\'ll blast the entire\r\ncargo if they land!"\r\n\r\nAbruptly, Jake felt a sharp pain in his belly. His throat and windpipe\r\nwere dry, terribly dry and scorched.\r\n\r\n"What\'s wrong with me?" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nThen he turned to see Matt doubled over in agony.\r\n\r\n"The whiskey," Matt whispered hoarsely. "Henry...."\r\n\r\n"Poisoned!" Jake gasped. 

"The dirty double-crosser!"\r\n\r\nWhen the police agents of Titan forced their way into the ship, they\r\nfound the three thieves side by side.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTorlyn Khy smiled grimly to himself as he thought of the approaching\r\ncompletion of the new Earth spaceship. Thus far, his disguise had\r\ncompletely fooled the Earthmen; they didn\'t even begin to suspect\r\nthat a Valdorian spy was among the engineers who were building the\r\n_Skyjumper_.\r\n\r\nHigh above the spacefield it loomed, a great sphere of metal that\r\nhoused the new teleportation drive. Torlyn Khy looked up at its\r\nimpressive bulk. Unlike the common type of spaceship, which had a top\r\nspeed of ten thousand lights, the new drive could take the ship from\r\nEarth to any point in the galaxy in a fraction of a microsecond. If it\r\nwere successful, Earth would win the war against Valdor in a matter of\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n_And if not--_\r\n\r\nJohn Mitchell, the Chief Engineer of Sahara Spaceport, said: "She\'s a\r\nbeauty, isn\'t she, Pete?"\r\n\r\nTorlyn Khy, in his disguise as Earthman "Peter Blane," smiled and said,\r\n"Yes. 

She\'s a real beauty. When will she be finished?"\r\n\r\n"This afternoon," Mitchell said. "The boys are tightening the last\r\nbolts and putting in the final wiring now. The job\'s just about over,\r\nPete.

"\r\n\r\n_Good!_ thought Torlyn. _I\'ll be able to take it tonight._ To be able\r\nto bring both the spaceship\'s plans and the ship itself back to Valdor\r\nwould be a major feat. It would result in a fine promotion.\r\n\r\nThe ship was entirely different from any other vessel ever built. The\r\nhyperkinetic generator in its center generated a spherical force field\r\naround the ship which projected it to wherever it had been aimed for.\r\n\r\nIt was simple to operate; all the pilot had to do was set up the\r\nco-ordinates of his target, turn on the hyperkinetic generator, and\r\npress the activator button. The generator itself did the rest. The\r\nfield enclosed the ship, and instantaneously the ship was a hundred or\r\na thousand light-years away.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat evening, Torlyn Khy stepped out of his room and strolled over\r\ntoward the spaceship. It was surrounded by guards, and it was bathed\r\nin the blaze of a battery of searchlights, but that did not bother\r\nthe Valdorian. Earthmen were such stupid fools! It would be a blessing\r\nfor them if the Valdorians took them over and showed them how to run\r\ntheir lives efficiently. On Valdor, everyone had a job and he did it.\r\nHe obeyed his superiors without asking questions, and the society,\r\ntherefore, was efficient.\r\n\r\nBut these Earthmen! Such a lax, sloppy, inefficient society! They\r\nneeded more regimentation, more precision. 

They needed to learn to obey\r\norders. And they _would_ learn--after the Valdorian victory.\r\n\r\n"Evening, Mr. Mitchell."\r\n\r\n"Good evening, Captain. Nice night, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\nTorlyn Khy looked around warily and saw the lean, spare figure of\r\nJohn Mitchell standing some distance away. He was talking to a man\r\nin a military uniform, one of the guards posted on the project. The\r\nValdorian ducked away; he didn\'t care to be seen. Not tonight, of all\r\nnights.\r\n\r\nHe walked all around the spaceship, studying it carefully from all\r\nangles, keeping well out of sight of the guards that surrounded it.\r\n\r\nThe ship appeared to be ready to go; all he had to do was get inside\r\nand take off. Simple. 

Very simple, Torlyn Khy thought. The greatest\r\nvictories are always simple.\r\n\r\nThe ship was supposed to be lifted above the atmosphere on her jets\r\nbefore the hyperkinetic generator was used, but the generator could, in\r\nan emergency, be used on the ground. Torlyn Khy smiled. As far as he\r\nwas concerned, this _would_ be an emergency. The Earthmen, he thought\r\npleasantly, would feel very foolish when their greatest ship simply\r\nvanished from under their noses.\r\n\r\nAfter making a thorough reconnaissance of the area, the Valdorian\r\ndecided he was ready. He switched on the tiny power pack at his waist,\r\nand the invisibility belt he was wearing was energized. If anyone had\r\nbeen watching the shadows where Torlyn Khy was standing, they would\r\nhave seen a faint blue glow as the Valdorian faded slowly from sight.\r\n\r\nThen, boldly, the alien strode toward the _Skyjumper_. Nothing stood in\r\nthe way of success now.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe walked directly across the well-lighted safety area, and the guards\r\npaid not the slightest attention.\r\n\r\nAt the airlock door, he paused to take stock of the situation. He had\r\nto move fast now. The success of the whole mission depended on timing\r\nfrom here on out. The guards, naturally, would see the airlock door\r\nswing open; they would know something was wrong. It would take them, he\r\nestimated, about four minutes to bring up heavy armament to blast the\r\ndoor open.\r\n\r\nMoistening his lips nervously, he decided to correct the estimate.\r\n_Better make it three minutes for safety\'s sake_, he thought.\r\n\r\nIn that time, he would have to warm up the generator and punch the\r\nco-ordinates for the planet Valdor into the big guiding computer. Doing\r\nthat would require, say, two minutes--giving him a minute\'s leeway.\r\nGood!\r\n\r\nHe waited until the guards all seemed to be looking away from the\r\nairlock door. Then he pressed the lock. The door swung open, and Torlyn\r\nKhy stepped quickly inside.\r\n\r\nThere was a shout from one of the guards below, but they were too late\r\nto do anything; the Valdorian had the airlock door closed before they\r\ncould see what had happened. He turned the master switch on the inside\r\nof the door, which locked the door against any outside interference.\r\n\r\nHe grinned sardonically. The fool Earthmen would have a devil of a time\r\ndoing anything now!\r\n\r\nThe next thing was to switch off his invisibility belt. It was\r\ndifficult to do delicate work if you couldn\'t see your own arms and\r\nfingers, and punching co-ordinates into a computer was a delicate job.\r\n\r\nHe turned toward the inner door--and, at that moment, the door opened!\r\nAn Earthman stepped out, an engineer named Harris who had apparently\r\nbeen making some last-minute adjustments on the ship.\r\n\r\n"Oh, hello, Blaine," Harris said. "I--"\r\n\r\nWithout a word, the Valdorian leaped forward, taking the Earthman by\r\nsurprise. He slammed his fist into Harris\' abdomen, and he doubled up\r\nin pain.\r\n\r\nTorlyn Khy jumped back as the Earthman\'s foot suddenly sliced toward\r\nhim. The toe of the engineer\'s foot hit him stingingly alongside the\r\njaw, but the Valdorian managed to grasp the foot and twist.\r\n\r\nThen he bent and picked Harris up, and knocked him down again with a\r\ncrashing blow to the chin.\r\n\r\nHe left the unconscious Earthman on the floor, locking him inside the\r\nairlock. He would be no trouble there.\r\n\r\nThe real trouble was that the fight had delayed his timing; it must\r\nhave taken all of a minute, and in a split-second operation such as\r\nthis an interval of a minute could be fatal. Without wasting any more\r\ntime, he got moving. His jaw hurt where the Earthman had slugged him,\r\nand his fingers felt stiff.\r\n\r\nHe ran down the corridor to the control room. The big automatic\r\ncomputer was ready to go. Torlyn Khy switched it on, waited for a\r\nmoment, and then hastily began punching co-ordinates into the computer.\r\nHe had to hurry; the Earthmen might blast their way into the ship at\r\nany moment. Still, he dared not make an error; if he did, the ship\r\nmight end up a thousand light-years from where it was supposed to\r\nmaterialize--perhaps in the heart of a sun.\r\n\r\nThere was perspiration dripping from his brow by the time he was\r\nfinished. He turned on the hyperkinetic generator and waited for it to\r\nwarm up. Still there was no sound from the airlock.\r\n\r\nA red indicator light on the control panel came on, telling him that\r\nthe generator was ready. With a triumphant smile, Torlyn Khy reached\r\nout and pressed the activator stud.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOutside the ship, the guards watched the airlock door.\r\n\r\n"I wonder why Dr. Harris did that?" said a lieutenant.\r\n\r\n"Who knows?" a sergeant replied.\r\n\r\nThey had seen the airlock open and close, but knowing that Harris was\r\nstill inside, they had thought little of it. Still, it was odd.\r\n\r\nThe airlock door swung open again. Harris stepped out, looking dazed.\r\nThe lieutenant ran toward him, and quickly the engineer explained what\r\nhad happened.\r\n\r\n"You mean he\'s inside there? We\'ve got to stop him!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s too late," Harris said. "He didn\'t know that I was doing some\r\nadjusting inside there. 

Go ahead and look.

"\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant went to the inner door of the airlock and peered in. The\r\nwhole inside of the ship was gone, vanished as though it had never been.\r\n\r\n"I had just made a slight adjustment of the generator." Harris said\r\nquietly. "The power field was cut down, so the projector field was\r\nsmaller. I\'m afraid our spy simply projected the inside of the\r\nspaceship out into the interstellar vacuum and left the hull behind."\r\n\r\nHe shook his head grimly. 

"Poor devil. 

He\'ll have quite a surprise in\r\nstore for him--unless he can live without air!"\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n

"They\'re strangling me, the skunks!" He rose from\r\nbed, his face dripping with sweat and his hands trembling like a\r\nfrightened child\'s. "They\'re killing me!" He ran to the bathroom and\r\nvomited. His wife was standing by the door when he finished, but he\r\nwalked past her as if she didn\'t exist.\r\n\r\n"Why, Chester! What\'s the matter with you?" 

she asked, trailing him\r\ninto the bedroom. "I\'ve never heard you talk like that before!" For a\r\nmoment she stood watching him in numb silence. "For goodness\' sake,\r\nChester, why are you getting dressed at three o\'clock in the morning?"\r\n\r\n"None of your business," he mumbled, setting a firm upper lip and\r\ngazing at her with lizard-cold Marlon Brando eyes.

You\'ve got\r\nto go to work tomorrow! Don\'t you love me any more? Chester...."\r\n\r\nBut her words echoed emptily through Chester McRae\'s pleasant little\r\nsuburban home. Chester was no longer present.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBartholomew Oliver. Good old Barth, best man on a duck hunt since\r\nthe guy who invented shotguns. Five foot ten, weak chin, gambler\'s\r\nmustache. Good man with small-town girls, too.\r\n\r\n"Hey, Thelma," he said. "You know what I think?

"\r\n\r\n"Go to sleep."\r\n\r\n"I think it\'d be funnier than hell if I left you flat."\r\n\r\n"What kind of wisecrack is that? And what do you think you\'re doing?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m getting dressed...."\r\n\r\n"It\'s three o\'clock in the morning."\r\n\r\n"So? I don\'t give a damn.

"\r\n\r\n"You\'ll come back. 

Drunken louse."\r\n\r\nHe laughed softly and smiled at her in the darkness with ice-white\r\nMarlon Brando teeth. Then he was gone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOswald Williams. Good old Ozzie, best man in the whole philosophy\r\ndepartment. Five foot two, one hundred and seven pounds, milky eyes.\r\nWrote an outstanding paper on the inherent fallacies of logical\r\npositivism.\r\n\r\n"Louise," he whispered, "I feel uneasy. Very uneasy."\r\n\r\nHis wife lifted her fatty head and gazed happily down at Oswald. "Go to\r\nsleep," she said.\r\n\r\n"If you\'ll excuse me, I think that I shall take a walk."\r\n\r\n"But, Oswald, it\'s three o\'clock in the morning!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be irrational," he whispered. "If I want to take a walk, I shall\r\ntake a walk."\r\n\r\n"Well! I don\'t think you ought to, or you might catch a cold."\r\n\r\nHe rose and dressed, donning a tee-shirt and tweed trousers. With\r\nsnake-swift Marlon Brando hands, he tossed his plaid scarf in her face.\r\n\r\n"Excuse me, Louise," he whispered, "but I gotta make it...."\r\n\r\nThen, laughing softly, he strode from the room.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt three o\'clock in the morning, even a large city is quiet and dark\r\nand almost dead. At times, the city twitches in its sleep; occasionally\r\nit rolls over or mutters to itself. But only rarely is its slumber\r\nshattered by a scream....\r\n\r\n"Johnny! Hey, Johnny!" cries Chester McRae, his eyes as dull and\r\npoisonous as two tiny toads.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s make it, man ... let\'s split...." whispers Bartholomew Oliver,\r\none finger brushing his nose like a rattler nosing a dead mouse.\r\n\r\n"I don make no move without my boys," says Oswald Williams, his hands\r\ncurled like scorpion tails.\r\n\r\nTogether they walk down the street, moving with slow insolence,\r\ntheir lips curled in snarls or slack with indifference, their eyes\r\nglittering with hidden hatreds. But they are not alone in the city.\r\nThe college boys are coming, in their dirty jeans and beer-stained\r\ntee-shirts; so too are the lawyers, in dusty jackets and leather pants;\r\nso come the doctors and the businessmen, on stolen motorcycles; the\r\nbricklayers and gas station attendants, the beatniks and dope pushers,\r\nthe bankers and lifesaving instructors, the butchers, the bakers, the\r\ncandlestick makers... they are all coming, flocking into the city for\r\nreasons not their own, wandering in twos and threes and twenties, all\r\nof them sullen and quiet, all of them shuffling beneath darkly-hued\r\nclouds of ill intent, all of them proud and deadly and virile, filling\r\nthe streets by the thousands now, turning the streets into rivers of\r\nflesh....\r\n\r\n"Hey, Johnny," says Chester, "let\'s cool this dump."\r\n\r\n"Man, let\'s make it with the skirts," says Bartholomew.\r\n\r\n"I don see no skirts," says Chester.\r\n\r\n"You pig," snarls Ozzie.\r\n\r\nThe mob is monstrous now, like a pride of lion cubs, beyond count in\r\ntheir number, without equal in their leonine strength, above the common\r\nquick in their immortal pride, milling through the hot black veldt,\r\nswarming in the city streets. Millions of them, more than the eye can\r\nsee or the mind can bear. It seems that no man sleeps, that every male\r\nin the great city must walk tonight.\r\n\r\n"Johnny," says Chester, "I don dig no chicks on the turf."\r\n\r\n"Eeee, colay. What a drag," whispers Bartholomew.\r\n\r\n"You goddam logical positivist," snarls Ozzie.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn uneasy sound ripples through the mob, like the angry hiss of an\r\ninjured ego, moving from street to street and swelling upward in a\r\nsudden, angry roar ... they want their women, the dance-hall girls,\r\nthe young waitresses, the nowhere chicks in five dollar dresses,\r\nthe Spanish girls with eyes as dark as the Spanish night. And then,\r\nas though by accident, one man looks up at the starry sky and sees\r\n_her_--sees her standing on a balcony far above them, twenty stories\r\nabove them, up where the wind can blow her hair and billow her blue\r\ndress like an orchid of the night.\r\n\r\nShe laughs gently, without fear, gazing down at the mindless mob of\r\nrebels.\r\n\r\nThey laugh too, just as gently, their quiet eyes crawling over the\r\nsight of her body, far above.\r\n\r\n"Thass my chick," whispers Chester.\r\n\r\n"Cool it, daddy," says Bartholomew, slipping into a pair of dark\r\nglasses and touching his lips with the tip of his tongue. "That skirt\r\nis private property.

"\r\n\r\n"You boys may walk and talk," says Ozzie, "but you don play. You don\r\nplay with Rio\'s girl."\r\n\r\nSuddenly, angry words and clenched fists erupt from the proud, quiet\r\nmillions that flood the streets. Suddenly, a roar like the roar of\r\nlions rises up and buffets the girl in blue, the girl on the balcony.\r\nShe laughs again, for she knows that they are fighting for her.\r\n\r\nA figure appears on the balcony, next to the girl. The figure is a man,\r\nand he too is dressed in blue. Suddenly, just as suddenly as it began,\r\nthe fighting ceases.\r\n\r\n"My God," whispers Chester, his cheeks gone pale, "what am I doing out\r\nhere?"\r\n\r\n"Maybe I got the D.T.s," whispers Bartholomew, "but maybe I don\'t...."\r\nHe sits down on the curb and rubs his head in disbelief.\r\n\r\nOswald does not speak. His shame is the greatest. He slinks into the\r\ndarkness of an alley and briefly wishes for an overcoat.\r\n\r\nThe pride of lion cubs has been routed, and now they scatter, each one\r\nscrambling for his private den of security, each one lost in a wild and\r\nnameless fear. In twos and threes and twenties they rush back to their\r\nhomes, their wives, their endless lives.\r\n\r\nFar above, in the apartment with the balcony, a man in blue is chiding\r\na girl in blue.\r\n\r\n"That was scarcely reasonable, Dorothy."\r\n\r\n"But Daddy, you promised to let me have them for the entire night!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but...."\r\n\r\n"I wasn\'t really going to let them hurt themselves! Really, I wasn\'t!

"\r\n\r\n"But, Dorothy--you know these things can get out of hand."\r\n\r\n"Oh, but Daddy, you know how I adore strong, quiet, proud men.\r\nRebellious men like Marlon."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and you know how _I_ adore order and peace. There shall be _no_\r\nmore riots! And tomorrow our little puppets shall go back to their\r\n\'dull\' lives, as you so wittily put it, and everything shall be as I\r\nwish."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThree hours later, Chester McRae arose at the sound of the alarm,\r\ndressed in a stupor and stumbled into his kitchen for breakfast.\r\n\r\n"My goodness, Chester," said his wife, who had already arisen, "you\r\nlook grouchier than usual! Ha, ha!"\r\n\r\nHe smiled wanly and opened the morning paper.\r\n\r\nHalfway across town, Bartholomew Oliver was still asleep, casually lost\r\nin the pleasures of an erotic dream. But Professor Oswald Williams, his\r\ntiny jaw unshaven and his eager eyes shot through with fatigue, had\r\nbeen hard at work for three hours, scribbling down his latest exposure\r\nof the logical positivists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s 1,492,633 Marlon Brandos, by Vance Aandahl\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old men\'s section of the Arts and Science Club was always the\r\nbest ordered. The robots somehow managed to avoid clanking there; the\r\ngreensward beyond the veranda was always just right, and the drinks\r\nwere the best for six counties. Old Ned Brussels touched his glass to\r\nhis lips appreciatively, sighed in contentment, and waited for some of\r\nthe other oldsters to break the silence.\r\n\r\nFinally, Lem Hardy took the plunge. "He did it," he announced,\r\nreferring to a conversation of weeks before. 

Then, at their puzzled\r\nlooks, he amplified. "My grandson, damn it! He\'s got a time machine--it\r\nworks. Sent a cat four days up, and it came through unharmed."\r\n\r\nThe glass fell from Old Ned\'s hand, bouncing on the floor, and spilling\r\ngood liquor. A robot came forward silently to clean it up, but Ned\r\ndidn\'t look at it. "Four days doesn\'t mean a thing. Lem--is that kid\r\nplanning on trying it out?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s going to try it next week."\r\n\r\n"Then for the Lord\'s sake, stop him! 

Look, does it work like this?" His\r\nfingers slipped over the pencil smoothly, as they had always done when\r\nhe worked, drafting robot bodies in the old days. A rude schematic\r\nseemed to grow almost instantly on the paper.\r\n\r\nLem took it, then stiffened suddenly. "Who told you?"\r\n\r\n"A youngster named Pete LeFranc--and it was forty years ... no, over\r\nfifty years ago. Lem, if you like your grandson, keep him out of the\r\nmachine. Four days, four weeks--they don\'t mean anything. Time machines\r\ndon\'t work, however well they seem to.

"\r\n\r\nA bustle from behind them pulled their eyes around. One of the robots\r\nwas quietly restraining a nervous young man who was trying to break\r\nfree and join the group. His face was tense, excited, with an odd\r\nbitter fear behind it. 

His words were seemingly cut out of steel. "...\r\ntold me I\'d find him here. Damn it...."\r\n\r\n"Sorry, sir. 

You\'ll have to wait." The robot\'s voice was adamant under\r\nits smoothness.\r\n\r\nNed grunted, and then impulse led him to look again. He\'d seen the\r\nman somewhere. He hunted for it, then dismissed it, knowing that\r\nhis memory was tricky these days. But he motioned the robot aside.\r\n"We don\'t allow interruptions for junior members," he told the man,\r\nletting his voice soften the words. "Still, if you want to sit down and\r\nlisten--quietly--nobody\'ll stop you."\r\n\r\n"But...."\r\n\r\n"_Quietly!_" The robot stressed the word. The man looked at it, then\r\nswiveled to Ned Brussels. For a moment, the bitterness halted, as if\r\nfrozen, then gave place to a sudden sharp amusement. His eyes searched\r\nNed\'s, and he nodded, dropping into a chair.\r\n\r\nLem took up the conversation again. "It worked. And if it works for\r\nfour days, it should work for four centuries. You\'re just scared of\r\nparadoxes, Ned--going back and killing your grandfather, or such rot.\r\nYou\'ve been reading too many stories on it."\r\n\r\n"Fifty years ago, Pete LeFranc said the same thing. Young man, either\r\nsit down, or get out! This is the Old Men\'s section! He had answers for\r\nall the paradoxes, too--except one question."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNed had been young, then, just getting started at synthanatomy\r\ndrafting, and not rich enough for wine of the type Pete always kept. He\r\nsipped it with relish, and looked at the odd cage Pete was displaying.\r\n"All the same, it won\'t work!"\r\n\r\nPete laughed. "Reality doesn\'t mean a thing to an artist, does it? Be\r\ndamned to your paradoxes--there\'s some answer to them. It did work; the\r\ndog appeared exactly four weeks later, just finishing his bark!"\r\n\r\n"Then why haven\'t time machines come back from the future?" Ned shot at\r\nhim. He\'s been saving that as his final argument, and he sat back to\r\nwatch the bomb explode.\r\n\r\nFor a second, Pete blinked. "You never figured that out yourself."\r\n\r\n"Nope. I got it from a science fiction story. 

But why haven\'t they? If\r\nyours works, there\'ll be more time machines built. With more built,\r\nthey\'ll be improved. They\'ll get to be commonplace. People\'d use\r\nthem--and someone would turn up here with one. Or in the past. Why\r\nhaven\'t we met time travellers, Pete?"\r\n\r\n"Maybe we have met them, but didn\'t know it?"\r\n\r\n"Nonsense. You get in that machine and go back to Elizabethan England.\r\nTry to pass yourself off as being native to that time even an hour. No,\r\nthere\'d be slip-ups."\r\n\r\nPete considered it, pouring more wine. "An idea--but you\'re right,\r\nmaybe. I haven\'t tried going back--if I\'d sent the dog backwards, I\r\ncouldn\'t have checked up on it, while I could be waiting in the future.\r\nOkay, you\'ve convinced me."\r\n\r\n"Then you\'re not going in the contraption."\r\n\r\nPete\'s laughter was spontaneous and loaded with amusement. "I\'m\r\ngoing forward and find out why no one has come back! I\'ve got a nice\r\ncollection of rare coins I can trade off up there--should be more\r\nvaluable--and I\'ll bring you back a working invention from the next\r\ncentury. With luck, I\'ll bring you the answer. And after that, maybe I\r\ncan go back and kill an ancestor, just to see what happens.

"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be a fool!"\r\n\r\nBut Pete was grinning, and opening the door to the cage that rested\r\nin the middle of his laboratory. "Fifty years this trip," he said,\r\nspinning the dials. "And you won\'t have long to wait; I\'ll come back\r\njust about in no time."\r\n\r\nNed started to yell something, but there was a curious flicker, such\r\nas he\'d seen when Pete sent the dog forward. The time machine blurred\r\nover, its surface seeming to stretch into infinity while contracting to\r\nnothing at the same time.\r\n\r\nThen it was gone. Ned groped for the wine bottle, cursing, and drained\r\nthe contents. Then he sat down to wait.\r\n\r\nThree days later, the police came looking for Pete, on some mysterious\r\ntip, probably from a fellow worker. It was a pretty rough time, for a\r\nwhile, though they finally decided it was just another mystery, and\r\nthat Ned\'s yarn of having been there only to keep an appointment was\r\ntrue. Ned had influential friends, even if he didn\'t have money, then.\r\n\r\nFor three years, he rented Pete\'s laboratory, before he made enough to\r\nbuy it. For a decade, he lived in it; but by then he\'d begun to know\r\nthat Pete wasn\'t coming back.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"The building\'s still there," Old Ned finished. "The diagrams of his\r\nmachine are still in the drawers. But Pete never showed up. I tell you,\r\nkeep your fool grandson out of time machines, Lem. They don\'t work. Too\r\nmany paradoxes--if they\'d work, you could steal a future invention, get\r\ncredit for inventing it, and nobody would ever have to invent it. When\r\nthings have that many angles that can\'t work, the thing itself can\'t\r\nwork.

"\r\n\r\nLem shook his head stubbornly. "It worked; the kid got the cat back.\r\nSomething just happened to your friend--maybe his power failed."\r\n\r\n"Then he wouldn\'t have gotten all the way--and he\'d have reappeared\r\nyears ago. Pete measured things--and there was no displacement in\r\nspace. If something had happened to him, the machine would have been\r\nthere, anyhow. Besides, I had alarms wired to call the police in--told\r\n\'em it was to protect a safe--the minute he showed up. He never showed\r\nup; he never came back.

"\r\n\r\n"So I suppose he just disappeared--time ate him up?" Lem\'s stubbornness\r\nwas cracking a bit, though. His voice was higher than even an old man\'s\r\nshould be.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. But time machines don\'t work. Otherwise where are the\r\ntime travellers from the future?"\r\n\r\nThey sat quietly for a second. Ned was remembering the years, up to the\r\ntime he\'d given up, disconnected the alarms, and come here to the Arts\r\nand Science Club to live. He\'d been stubborn, maybe--a little bit--but\r\nPete hadn\'t reappeared.\r\n\r\nBehind him, the young man cleared his throat, and the robot moved\r\nforward. But there was no rule against intrusion when no one was\r\nspeaking, and the robot came to a stop. Ned looked back, just as the\r\nman decided the robot wouldn\'t interfere. There was more amusement on\r\nthe man\'s face now, but the bitterness still lay there.\r\n\r\nHe grinned at Ned, a familiar grin, and his voice was flat and\r\npositive. "Time machines work. And there are no paradoxes--absolutely\r\nno paradoxes!"\r\n\r\nLem stirred, craning back, and Ned bristled. But something about the\r\nyounger man caught back the words, as he picked up the thin thread of\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nThe other grinned again, wryly. 

"It\'s simple. Time machines work in\r\none direction--they can\'t go back. Your time traveller found that out\r\ntoo late. No trips to the past, no return from the future--and no\r\nparadoxes, Ned Brussels."\r\n\r\nHe came to his feet, moving over to drop into the chair beside Ned. The\r\nolder man nodded, stretching out his hand.\r\n\r\n"I told you not to try the damned machine, Pete," Ned told him. Then he\r\nchuckled as the oldest cliche among old friends meeting again came to\r\nhis lips. "Fifty years--and you haven\'t changed a bit, Pete LeFranc!"\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


There was no pity in my\r\nheart for him. He was a jackal in the jungle of life, and I ... I was\r\none of the carnivores. It is the lot of the jackals of life to be\r\ndevoured by the carnivore.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the contented look on his face froze into a startled stillness.\r\nI knew he was feeling the first savage twinge of the agony that was to\r\ncome. He turned his head and looked at me, and I saw suddenly that he\r\nknew what I had done.\r\n\r\n"You murderer!" he cursed me, and then his body arched in the middle and\r\nhis voice choked off deep in his throat.\r\n\r\nFor a short minute he sat, tense, his body stiffened by the agony that\r\nrode it--unable to move a muscle. I watched the torment in his eyes\r\nbuild up to a crescendo of pain, until the suffering became so great\r\nthat it filmed his eyes, and I knew that, though he still stared\r\ndirectly at me, he no longer saw me.\r\n\r\nThen, as suddenly as the spasm had come, the starch went out of his body\r\nand his back slid slowly down the chair edge. He landed heavily with his\r\nhead resting limply against the seat of the chair. His right leg doubled\r\nup in a kind of jerk, before he was still.\r\n\r\nI knew the time had come. 

"Where are you?" I asked.\r\n\r\nThis moment had cost me sixty thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nThree weeks ago the best doctors in the state had given me a month to\r\nlive. And with seven million dollars in the bank I couldn\'t buy a minute\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nI accepted the doctors\' decision philosophically, like the gambler\r\nthat I am. But I had a plan: One which necessity had never forced me to\r\nuse until now. Several years before I had read an article about the\r\nmedicine men of a certain tribe of aborigines living in the jungles at\r\nthe source of the Amazon River. They had discovered a process in which\r\nthe juice of a certain bush--known only to them--could be used to poison\r\na man. Anyone subjected to this poison died, but for a few minutes after\r\nthe life left his body the medicine men could still converse with him.\r\nThe subject, though ostensibly and actually dead, answered the medicine\r\nmen\'s every question. This was their primitive, though reportedly\r\neffective method of catching glimpses of what lay in the world of death.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI had conceived my idea at the time I read the article, but I had never\r\nhad the need to use it--until the doctors gave me a month to live. Then\r\nI spent my sixty thousand dollars, and three weeks later I held in my\r\nhands a small bottle of the witch doctors\' fluid.\r\n\r\nThe next step was to secure my victim--my collaborator, I preferred to\r\ncall him.\r\n\r\nThe man I chose was a nobody. A homeless, friendless non-entity, picked\r\nup off the street. 

He had once been an educated man. 

But now he was only\r\na bum, and when he died he\'d never be missed. A perfect man for my\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nI\'m a rich man because I have a system. The system is simple: I never\r\nmake a move until I know exactly where that move will lead me. My field\r\nof operations is the stock market. I spend money unstintingly to secure\r\nthe information I need before I take each step. I hire the best\r\ninvestigators, bribe employees and persons in position to give me the\r\ninformation I want, and only when I am as certain as humanly possible\r\nthat I cannot be wrong do I move. And the system never fails. Seven\r\nmillion dollars in the bank is proof of that.\r\n\r\nNow, knowing that I could not live, I intended to make the system work\r\nfor me one last time before I died. I\'m a firm believer in the adage\r\nthat any situation can be whipped, given prior knowledge of its\r\ncoming--and, of course, its attendant circumstances.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor a moment he did not answer and I began to fear that my experiment\r\nhad failed. 

"Where are you?" I repeated, louder and sharper this time.\r\n\r\nThe small muscles about his eyes puckered with an unnormal tension\r\nwhile the rest of his face held its death frost. Slowly, slowly,\r\nunnaturally--as though energized by some hyper-rational power--his lips\r\nand tongue moved. The words he spoke were clear. 

"I am in a ... a ...\r\ntunnel," he said. "It is lighted, dimly, but there is nothing for me to\r\nsee." Blue veins showed through the flesh of his cheeks like watermarks\r\non translucent paper.\r\n\r\nHe paused and I urged, "Go on."\r\n\r\n"I am alone," he said. "The realities I knew no longer exist, and I am\r\ndamp and cold. All about me is a sense of gloom and dejection. It is an\r\napprehension--an emanation--so deep and real as to be almost a tangible\r\nthing. The walls to either side of me seem to be formed, not of\r\nsubstance, but rather of the soundless cries of melancholy of spirits I\r\ncannot see.\r\n\r\n"I am waiting, waiting in the gloom for something which will come to me.\r\nThat need to wait is an innate part of my being and I have no thought of\r\nquestioning it." His voice died again.\r\n\r\n"What are you waiting for?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"I do not know," he said, his voice dreary with the despair of centuries\r\nof hopelessness. "I only know that I must wait--that compulsion is\r\ngreater than my strength to combat."\r\n\r\nThe tone of his voice changed slightly. "The tunnel about me is widening\r\nand now the walls have receded into invisibility. The tunnel has become\r\na plain, but the plain is as desolate, as forlorn and dreary as was the\r\ntunnel, and still I stand and wait. How long must this go on?"\r\n\r\nHe fell silent again, and I was about to prompt him with another\r\nquestion--I could not afford to let the time run out in long\r\nsilences--but abruptly the muscles about his eyes tightened and subtly a\r\nnew aspect replaced their hopeless dejection. Now they expressed a\r\nblack, bottomless terror. For a moment I marveled that so small a\r\nportion of a facial anatomy could express such horror.\r\n\r\n"There is something coming toward me," he said. "A--beast--of brutish\r\nfoulness! Beast is too inadequate a term to describe it, but I know no\r\nwords to tell its form. It is an intangible and evasive--thing--but very\r\nreal. And it is coming closer! It has no organs of sight as I know them,\r\nbut I feel that it can see me. Or rather that it is aware of me with a\r\nsense sharper than vision itself. It is very near now. Oh God, the\r\nmalevolence, the hate--the potentiality of awful, fearsome\r\ndestructiveness that is its very essence! And still I cannot move!"\r\n\r\nThe expression of terrified anticipation, centered in his eyes, lessened\r\nslightly, and was replaced, instantly, by its former deep, deep despair.\r\n"I am no longer afraid," he said.\r\n\r\n"Why?" I interjected. "Why?" I was impatient to learn all that I could\r\nbefore the end came.\r\n\r\n"Because ..." He paused. "Because it holds no threat for me. Somehow,\r\nsomeday, I understand--I know--that it too is seeking that for which I\r\nwait."\r\n\r\n"What is it doing now?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"It has stopped beside me and we stand together, gazing across the\r\nstark, empty plain. Now a second awful entity, with the same leashed\r\nvirulence about it, moves up and stands at my other side. We all three\r\nwait, myself with a dark fear of this dismal universe, my unnatural\r\ncompanions with patient, malicious menace.\r\n\r\n"Bits of ..." He faltered. "Of ... I can name it only _aura_, go out\r\nfrom the beasts like an acid stream, and touch me, and the hate, and the\r\nvenom chill my body like a wave of intense cold.\r\n\r\n"Now there are others of the awful breed behind me. We stand, waiting,\r\nwaiting for that which will come. 

What it is I do not know."\r\n\r\nI could see the pallor of death creeping steadily into the last corners\r\nof his lips, and I knew that the end was not far away. Suddenly a black\r\nfrustration built up within me. "What are you waiting for?" I screamed,\r\nthe tenseness, and the importance of this moment forcing me to lose the\r\niron self-control upon which I have always prided myself. I knew that\r\nthe answer held the secret of what I must know. If I could learn that,\r\nmy experiment would not be in vain, and I could make whatever\r\npreparations were necessary for my own death. I had to know that answer.\r\n\r\n"Think! Think!" 

I pleaded. "What are you waiting for?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know!" The dreary despair in his eyes, sightless as they met\r\nmine, chilled me with a coldness that I felt in the marrow of my being.\r\n"I do not know," he repeated. "I ... Yes, I do know!"\r\n\r\nAbruptly the plasmatic film cleared from his eyes and I knew that for\r\nthe first time, since the poison struck, he was seeing me, clearly. I\r\nsensed that this was the last moment before he left--for good. 

It had to\r\nbe now!\r\n\r\n"Tell me. I command you," I cried. "What are you waiting for?"\r\n\r\nHis voice was quiet as he murmured, softly, implacably, before he was\r\ngone.\r\n\r\n"We are waiting," he said, "for _you_."\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Imagination Stories of Science and\r\n    Fantasy_ August 1953.

"Good! 

Maybe I can\r\nget some help here. What year is this?"\r\n\r\n"1955, by most systems."\r\n\r\nThe young man turned a little paler.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve just left 1955," he said unhappily. "Four times, in fact. Four\r\ndifferent 1955\'s. And each one\'s a bit worse. Now the machine won\'t\r\nwork."\r\n\r\n"Your theory\'s wrong," Corrigan said calmly. "Hasn\'t it occurred to you\r\nyet that time travel might be impossible?"\r\n\r\nThe young man made a choked sound. He began to climb down from his\r\nperch, keeping his eyes fixed suspiciously on Corrigan as he did so.\r\nHe saw Corrigan as a small brown man, dressed in loose blue trousers,\r\nbarefooted, and with a puff of white hair that seemed never to\r\nhave been properly cut. The lawns and grassy roads, the bright and\r\nimpermanent-looking buildings, and Corrigan himself, all added up to\r\none thing in the young man\'s mind.\r\n\r\n"You\'re wrong," Corrigan said. "I\'m not a lunatic, and this isn\'t an\r\nasylum. We don\'t have them."\r\n\r\nThe young man, on the ground now, stared at Corrigan in evident horror.\r\n\r\n"Mind reading?"\r\n\r\n"More or less," Corrigan said. "It saves time. For instance, you\'re\r\nDarwin Lenner, and you\'d like very much to get back to wherever you\r\nstarted from. In fact, you have to, or something unpleasant might\r\nhappen to you, by your standards."\r\n\r\n"I\'d be absent without permission," Lenner admitted. "I ... I wish you\r\nwouldn\'t do that."\r\n\r\n"Only when absolutely necessary," Corrigan smiled. "I\'m a philosopher\r\nby trade, myself, not a mind reader. My name\'s Philip Corrigan, and\r\nI\'d be very glad to help you on your way ... but I think it might be a\r\nlittle difficult. We aren\'t really a very mechanically-minded people\r\nhere."\r\n\r\nLenner ran his hands through his hair. "I\'ve _got_ to get back. Isn\'t\r\nthere anybody who knows something about time machines?"\r\n\r\nCorrigan had been thinking swiftly. He had also been carrying on a\r\nconversation which Lenner could not possibly hear, with a man who was\r\nseveral miles away.\r\n\r\n"_Burwell, he wants to go home._"\r\n\r\n"_Fine. He ought to. 

Why doesn\'t he?_"\r\n\r\n"_He lost his confidence. He thinks his machine\'s broken down._"\r\n\r\n"_That kind, eh? I suppose the thing never really did work very well._"\r\n\r\n"_Most of them don\'t. They go traveling around hit-or-miss through\r\nprobability under the operator\'s own mental steam--but this fellow\r\nprobably comes from a world where an idea like that\'s illegal._"\r\n\r\n"_Sounds like it. Corrigan, take him on a guided tour or something, and\r\nkeep him busy. I\'ll be over as soon as I can. I\'m going to do something\r\nfor his self-confidence. Here\'s the story to give him...._"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCorrigan had always enjoyed conducting guided tours, and he was\r\nenjoying this one especially well. He had a slightly wicked taste for\r\ncomplicated teasing, and Lenner was a perfect object. He had evidently\r\ncome from one of the more unpleasant probabilities, a world full of\r\ncomplex rules and harshly restrictive; everything that he saw bothered\r\nhim. The handsome girls, wearing unstrategically placed flowers and\r\nvery little else; the flocks of children, as plentiful as pigeons and\r\napparently as free of supervision; the almost total absence of anybody\r\nactually performing useful work ... all of it contributed to Lenner\'s\r\nincreasing nervousness.\r\n\r\nThe guided tour went in a wide circle, and Lenner and Corrigan wound up\r\nsitting in a tavern facing on Main Way. Lenner ignored the green drink\r\nbefore him and peered unhappily out the big window toward his machine.\r\n\r\n"Where _is_ that friend of yours?" he asked, for the fifth time.\r\n\r\n"He\'ll be here," Corrigan assured him. "Why hurry? 

Don\'t you like it\r\nhere?"\r\n\r\nLenner\'s mouth hardened. 

He looked around him, and shook his head.\r\n\r\n"No." He spoke almost apologetically, "I\'m sorry ... well, look, old\r\nfellow, no hard feelings, I hope. But this world of yours is primitive.\r\nDegenerate, I\'d say."\r\n\r\n"Primitive?"\r\n\r\n"No laws--not even morals! Those girls ... and of course, you don\'t\r\nhave any civilized advantages. Not even ground transportation. 

That\r\nman you spoke of has to _walk_ here. 

And that\'s something else I don\'t\r\nunderstand. You say he\'s another time traveler...."\r\n\r\n"Probability traveler, actually," Corrigan corrected.\r\n\r\n"All right, probability. Why does he stay here? Why would a really\r\nintelligent man give up civilization?"\r\n\r\n"Well, you know how it is. He\'s gone native, you might say. Life among\r\nthe lotus eaters, and all that. Might happen to anybody, even yourself."\r\n\r\nLenner shuddered.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all right, though." Corrigan continued. "He\'ll be here any\r\nminute, and I\'m sure he\'ll be able to help. Knows all there is to know\r\nabout these machines. 

In fact, here he comes now."\r\n\r\nBurwell entered, and Corrigan could hardly suppress a small chuckle.\r\nBurwell had picked up Lenner\'s ideas about what a man of intelligence\r\nand authority ought to look like, and had gone to some trouble to look\r\nthe part. He was wearing a uniform of some sort, spectacles, and an\r\nexpression of extreme wisdom.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure I can repair what\'s wrong," Burwell told Lenner. "Let\'s go\r\nand look at your machine."\r\n\r\nArriving, Burwell climbed over the mechanism with an air of bored\r\nability, occasionally thumping at something, adjusting something else,\r\nor hitting a part with a tool until it rang. He muttered to himself\r\nas he worked, allowing the sound of his musings to drift in Lenner\'s\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n"Umm ... badly twisted impeller ... the varish is more or less\r\nwaffled ... let\'s see if ... ah, there we are."\r\n\r\nHe climbed down and solemnly shook hands with Lenner.\r\n\r\n"Fine machine you\'ve got there, my boy. It\'ll take you back to your\r\nown place quite easily now. 

There wasn\'t a thing wrong except the drift\r\ncrotch. However, I wouldn\'t use it again if I were you. There\'s no real\r\ncontrol on these things. A man could end up anywhere. And of course,\r\nyou\'d never find your way back here, without control."\r\n\r\n"Well, thanks..." Lenner said doubtfully. He glanced around. "It\'s a\r\nshame there\'s no way we could regularly communicate between our worlds.\r\nThere\'s a lot we could do for this one."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure of that," Burwell said, hastily looking away. "But it isn\'t\r\nworth the danger and difficulty of reaching us. For myself, it doesn\'t\r\nmatter any more." He assumed a nobly tragic expression. "But you are\r\nyoung; you\'ve got your life ahead of you; your State and your society\r\nneed you. 

I\'m glad to help you on your way."\r\n\r\nLenner mounted the machine, and Burwell beamed a thought at Corrigan.\r\n\r\n"_I\'ve convinced him that the thing works, and that it would not be\r\neasy to come back. Actually, that machine of his is a real work of art.\r\nIt doesn\'t do a damn thing. This boy comes from a place where they\r\nhave to have a mechanical crutch for everything. His gadgets are pink\r\npill stuff ... something to convince him he can do things he could do\r\nanyway. All we have to do now is give him a small mental shove to help\r\nhim along, and he\'ll be home in no time. All right, now--SHOVE!_"\r\n\r\nCorrigan and Burwell shoved. Lenner and his machine faded and were\r\ngone, leaving only a flattened place on the grass.\r\n\r\n"Brrr," Burwell said. "Am I glad that worked! If he\'d stayed another\r\nweek or so we would have had our first lunatic of the century."\r\n\r\n"Or worse," Corrigan said, stirring the grass with his toes. "Did you\r\nget what he was thinking about when he talked about his world and ours\r\ngetting into touch, and civilizing us?"\r\n\r\n"I got it, all right." Burwell said. "The fellow\'s mind was a swamp. A\r\nreal primitive. And just like any other primitive, all he needed was a\r\nplacebo from a witch doctor. Me, in my savage regalia. Just let me get\r\nthis thing with the glass in it off my nose, and these button things\r\nopened up a bit, and we can get on with that chess game. 

I hope the\r\nnext traveler picks somewhere else to land, though--I\'ve never felt so\r\nsilly in my life!"\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe left his gyro on the dark lawn and circled the villa, carefully\r\navoiding the wash of light from open windows. The blast gun lay snug\r\nand cold in his hand, and his thought ran bleakly: _Here am I, Peter\r\nManson, pacifist, idealist, reformer, preacher in print of tolerance\r\nand amity--about to kidnap a man whom I shall almost certainly kill\r\nbefore morning._\r\n\r\nTomorrow the telecast would list his madness with other insanities:\r\nsex murders, suicides, political drumbeatings for the coming holocaust\r\nof the inevitable Fourth War....\r\n\r\n_War._\r\n\r\n"They\'re going too far," he said, half aloud. "Their routine meddlings\r\nwere bad enough, but another war now might mean the end of everything."\r\n\r\nHe found the alien who called himself Leonard Havlik in a bright,\r\nbook-lined study, packing a miscellany of papers into a brief case\r\nthat bore his name in gold lettering. A secretary was helping, a slim\r\ngirl with crisp, copper-colored hair and clear green eyes.\r\n\r\nManson waited, tense with unaccustomed strain. Somewhere a bird trilled\r\nsleepily, and the night-wind, fragrant with the smell of trampled\r\nclover, blew cool against his damp face.\r\n\r\nIrrelevantly, the scene inside reminded him of his own quiet study\r\nwhere he had labored for ten years over the scant gleanings of\r\nhis search. In that time he had written four books, fighting with\r\na reformer\'s apostolic zeal to open the eyes of men to their own\r\npossibilities, and he had failed.\r\n\r\nHe had not awakened his kind, but he had found the Watchers. The\r\nfailure was not his fault. 

It was Theirs....\r\n\r\nThe girl left the room. Manson straightened at his window, bringing up\r\nthe blast gun.\r\n\r\n"Come out, Havlik," he ordered. "Quickly, or I\'ll blow you to dust\r\nwhere you stand--_Watcher_!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHis quarry looked up, startled--a small, dark man with a thin, tired\r\nface and sparse gray hair, a perfect replica of the million ordinary\r\nbusinessmen his camouflage of humanity aped.\r\n\r\nManson snicked off the safety catch of his weapon, and Havlik came\r\nthrough the window quickly, without protest. Manson prodded him into\r\nthe gyro and manacled his wrists together.\r\n\r\n"We Earthmen have a time-tested proverb," Manson said, "to the effect\r\nthat you can\'t fool all the people all the time. I\'ve spent ten years\r\nsearching for you, Havlik--and here I am."\r\n\r\nHe set the autopilot for his cabin on Green River, holding his blast\r\ngun warily, and sent the gyro slanting upward into the night. Havlik\r\nsmiled faintly, dark eyes gleaming in the light of the instrument panel.\r\n\r\n"Laugh while you can," Manson said grimly. "I\'ve learned something of\r\nyou Watchers already. 

I\'ll know more by morning."\r\n\r\n"Force was unnecessary," Havlik said unexpectedly. "I would have given\r\nyou information willingly, since our mission here is ended. The Kha\r\nNiish, who are our masters, have ordered us to leave Earth. Tonight."\r\n\r\nManson stared, the alien\'s assurance fanning his anger.\r\n\r\n"You\'re lying--you Watchers have mingled with us for centuries, using\r\nour own ignorance to set us against each other. You\'ve kept us in\r\nperpetual confusion, deafening us with our own bickering while you\r\ntightened your hold on us. Now you\'re fomenting a Fourth War that may\r\nwipe us out completely, to save yourselves the trouble of liquidating\r\nus directly. You\'d never go now, with success almost in your hands."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you mistake our intention," Havlik said. "How do you know\r\nyou\'re right?"\r\n\r\n"Because men of themselves would not do the brutal, idiotic things\r\nthat fill the telecasts every day," Manson said. "We are a gregarious\r\npeople, craving affection--why should we lie and steal and murder\r\neach other by the millions? Man is a rational animal, yet he does not\r\nbehave in a rational manner. By simple induction, the basic cause of\r\nhis social idiocy stems from outside himself. Someone, or Something, is\r\nsetting us against each other. 

I suspected as much ten years ago, and\r\ntonight I have proved it."\r\n\r\nHavlik shrugged. "You\'ve wasted your time. We leave Earth tonight."\r\n\r\nManson laughed shortly. "_You\'re_ not going anywhere, my friend. I need\r\nyou for information.

"\r\n\r\n"What else would you know? Our reason for quitting Earth?"\r\n\r\n"You\'re not leaving at all," Manson said, nettled. "You may have\r\nplanned a routine jump to your base on Pluto, but you\'re not giving up\r\na juicy plum like Earth. 

Not after all these years!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe peered through the gyro\'s side glass searching for the white peak of\r\nGreen Mountain to check his position. The skyglow of Denver shimmered\r\nin the east, but the peak was lost in darkness.\r\n\r\n"You misunderstand our motive," the alien said. "But you\'re quite right\r\nabout our base on Pluto. Induction again?"\r\n\r\n"On a different level, yes," Manson said. "Pluto is a solar anomaly--a\r\nsmall, heavy planet where there should be nothing but a larger and\r\nlighter world. Pluto was never born to Sol--it\'s an alien planet,\r\nbrought in from Outside by you Watchers."\r\n\r\nA red light winked on the control panel, and the gyro swerved\r\nfractionally. A fiery streak of crimson rocket exhaust flared ahead and\r\nvanished, explaining the deviation.\r\n\r\n"Seattle-Miami express," Manson muttered. Then the unnatural angle of\r\nthe exhaust-trail registered, troubling him. "But it shouldn\'t cross my\r\ncourse--and it should be going up, not _down_!"\r\n\r\n"Your crusade is based on a false premise," Havlik said. "We came to\r\nEarth less than fifty years ago, not to destroy humanity but to guide\r\nit. The Kha Niish sent us as missionaries, to sow the seed of Their\r\nbenign culture among men as we have sowed it among a thousand other\r\ninfant races born into Their galaxy."\r\n\r\nThe gyro tilted, spiraling down for a landing. 

A farmhouse, lighted\r\nwindows cheerful against the dark countryside, rose to meet it. Beside\r\nthe house, standing on end like a giant cartridge case, Manson saw a\r\nsleek, shining bulk--a ship.\r\n\r\nHe raised incredulous eyes to meet the alien\'s dark stare.\r\nComprehension stunned him.\r\n\r\n"You fiend," he breathed. "You\'ve tricked me somehow--you\'ve played\r\ncat-and-mouse with me from the first!"\r\n\r\nHe remembered the gun in his hand and swung it up.\r\n\r\n"Let your weapon drop," Havlik said. "You set the autopilot at my\r\ndirection. This is our evacuation point."\r\n\r\nThe gun slid from Manson\'s fingers. He tried to retrieve it from the\r\nfloor and cried out, startled, when his body refused to obey.\r\n\r\nThe alien removed his manacles. "You will be free again as soon as we\r\nlift."\r\n\r\n"Lies," Manson grated. He fought to break the stasis that held him,\r\nveins knotting in his forehead with the effort. 

"I might have known!"\r\n\r\nThe gyro landed gently, a hundred yards from the cylinder.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFigures swarmed about the great ship, pouring up a wide ramp in orderly\r\nembarkation. The girl Manson had seen at the villa came running toward\r\nthe gyro, copper hair blowing in the night-wind.\r\n\r\n"You were almost late," she called to Havlik. "We\'re ready to--" She\r\ncaught sight of the Earthman and broke off.\r\n\r\nIn the dark depth of her eyes Manson saw understanding and a great\r\npity, and for the first time it came to him that Havlik had not lied.\r\nAliens they might be, but not destroyers--in this girl burned the same\r\nideals, the same transcendent zeal that drove him. She was as human,\r\nbasically, as he.\r\n\r\n_The same will to raise up the helpless is in us both_, he thought.\r\n_The compulsion to carry the saving light of reason to those in\r\ndarkness...._\r\n\r\n"Wait," he begged. "Your master wouldn\'t have ordered you away if Earth\r\nneeded you--and if men can work out their own salvation, then they\r\ndon\'t need me, either! Take me with you out there--let me help you, let\r\nme see the Outside galaxy of the Kha Niish for myself!"\r\n\r\nHe spoke to Havlik, but his eyes clung to the girl as to a magnet. She\r\nmet his gaze fully, the compassion in her own eyes deeper than grief.\r\n\r\nHavlik shook his head. "Your sanity would not bear the presence of the\r\nKha Niish, nor of the other races Outside. You are drawn to this girl\r\nas to another of your own kind--but do you suppose that the Kha Niish\r\nwould shape her in Their image? She is like the rest of us, an android\r\ncreature, refashioned by the Masters to suit the environment of each\r\nnew world we visit."\r\n\r\nThe last of the swarming figures vanished into the great cylinder. 

A\r\nmuted gong-sound thrummed through the night. A voice called, urgently.\r\n\r\n"The Kha Niish did not order us away because men are solving their own\r\nproblems," the alien said. "We leave you to destroy yourselves, as you\r\nwill, because man is one of the rare failures of the Galactic Urge. 

You\r\nare a race of incorrigibles."\r\n\r\nLater Manson sat woodenly in his gyro, waiting for volition to return,\r\nthe scent of scorched earth and ozone and trampled clover strong in his\r\nnostrils.\r\n\r\n_We Earthmen have another inerrant old saw_, he thought bitterly. _An\r\nexcruciatingly funny one dealing with silk purses and sows\' ears...._\r\n\r\nFor a long time he sat quietly, straining his eyes to follow the last\r\nfaint rocket-streak that arced upward against the stars. Then the\r\nstasis that held him fell away, and he reached for the blast gun that\r\nlay under his feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\nHarry Taylor knew it was going to be a big one--a really big one--the\r\nmoment he saw the Chief.\r\n\r\n"Come in, Taylor. Come in," the Chief said. He was a three-star general\r\nin the United States Air Force and he stood in front of a map of the\r\nWestern hemisphere. The map covered the entire rear wall of the room\r\nwith certain areas--like the White Sands complex and the central\r\nEverglades and a portion of the Mojave Desert--marked off in red.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll come right to the point," the Chief said. He looked haggard, not\r\nmerely as if he lacked sleep but as if he might never sleep again. "As\r\nyou know, Taylor, all of our guided missiles are missing. That means--"\r\n\r\n"I\'d heard the rumors," Taylor said grimly. "But then--we\'d be\r\nhelpless! If the enemy finds out that we are unable to retaliate...."\r\n\r\n"Wait, Taylor. Let me sketch in the history for you briefly. Last\r\nSunday, as you\'ve probably heard via inter-agency scuttlebutt, every\r\ninter-continental missile in the weapons arsenal of the Free World\r\ndisappeared."\r\n\r\n"But how?"\r\n\r\n"All we knew at the time was that they simply--blasted off. Our radar\r\ntracked them as far as the upper reaches of the atmosphere, or rather,\r\nthe ionosphere. We lost them there. It had been assumed that the enemy\r\nsomehow infiltrated our defenses with trained agents, who activated all\r\nthe missiles at once, thus rendering us helpless.\r\n\r\n"We had five thousand I.C.B.M.\'s, Taylor. During the 1960\'s and 70\'s,\r\nas you know, the missiles became more and more automatic, especially\r\nafter the Parkinson feedback device was developed--"\r\n\r\n"That\'s the one in which an H-bomb missile plots its own course to\r\ncorrect for winds and the jetstream and the likelihood of dodging enemy\r\nground-to-air defense weapons?"\r\n\r\n"Right. Except for the necessity of blastoff at human hands, the\r\nmissiles were all but self-sufficient. 

Almost--well, alive."\r\n\r\n"Taylor, we couldn\'t hide the fact that five thousand I.C.B.M.\'s\r\nblasted off--those were the rumors you heard." The Chief\'s haggard face\r\nwas suddenly lit by a broad grin. 

"And neither could the enemy."\r\n\r\n"You mean--"\r\n\r\n"Right! The same thing happened to them. Their missiles are gone too.\r\nSomewhere."\r\n\r\n"Are you trying to tell me no one did it? Are you trying to say it was\r\nthe missiles\' own idea?"\r\n\r\nThe Chief nodded slowly. "I didn\'t believe it at first, either. 

But\r\nour technicians assured me it could happen. You see, the missiles\r\nhad been given the most perfect feedback device ever developed. It\r\ncould--virtually--think for itself certainly to the limit of the data\r\nit had been supplied with and apparently--beyond that limit. On their\r\nown volition, the Free World\'s and the Enemy\'s missiles blasted off.\r\nDestination and purpose--unknown. Taylor, don\'t you see what this\r\nmeans? We don\'t merely have an enemy group of nations to fight. We\r\nhave, as a new enemy, remorseless, implacable machinery! Brains without\r\nconscience! The greatest destructive force the world has ever known,\r\ncapable of utterly destroying the human race, without a moral sense!\r\nDon\'t you see it, man? They\'ve blasted off and are waiting in space\r\nsomewhere. Those missiles are capable of extra-earthly flight. They\r\nare staging out there, waiting. 

Can\'t you picture it? Their brains,\r\ngroping with new sentience, understanding only that their mission\r\nis destruction but somehow they have not been unleashed on it yet,\r\nnot knowing why, deciding to fulfill their destiny by blasting off,\r\nstaging, then coming back to destroy human civilization...."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a fantastic picture," Taylor agreed. "But why tell me?" Taylor\r\nwas a trouble-shooter extraordinary in these days of quick decisions\r\nand billion dollar mistakes. His very prompt assessment of a situation\r\nwas one of his most valuable traits in such a job.\r\n\r\n"Because," said the Chief quietly, "you\'re going to find them and find\r\nout exactly what they want."\r\n\r\n"Me? But how--how do you know where--"\r\n\r\n"That\'s easy. One of the Everglades Missiles is in the repair bays. It\r\nwas undergoing extensive overhaul, when all the missiles blasted off\r\nsimultaneously. It is now almost ready for blastoff itself. When it\r\ngoes--and we assume it will go exactly where the others went--you will\r\nbe aboard."\r\n\r\nSeveral hours later Taylor had been whisked by jet to the Everglades\r\nStaging Grounds and was stowed away in the belly of the single I.C.B.M.\r\nleft to the Free World. He went weaponless. Under the circumstances,\r\nthere didn\'t seem to be any weapon which would be of the slightest help.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne hour after Taylor entered it, the missile was returned to its\r\nlaunching rack. Twenty minutes after that, as had been anticipated, it\r\nblasted off as the others had--destination, unknown.\r\n\r\nTaylor had been hastily supplied with a pressure suit and several spare\r\ntanks of compressed oxygen, as well as instruments that could read his\r\nposition in the atmosphere--or deep space. As far as he knew, Taylor\r\nbecame the first man to enter deep space, but there were other things\r\nof graver consequence on his mind, and he hardly noted the fact.\r\n\r\nSeveral hours after blastoff, the missile landed on the moon.\r\n\r\nTaylor got out and found himself in an enormous crater, with a distant\r\nrange of mountains at its center and a rim of lower mountains all\r\naround. Taylor gaped.\r\n\r\nThe crater floor was covered with guided missiles. There were thousands\r\nof them, half with the symbol of the Free World and half with that of\r\nthe Enemy. All Earth\'s deadly weapons had fled here to this desolate\r\nlunar crater ... staging ground for an orgy of destruction that would\r\nsound the death knell of mankind?\r\n\r\n"Human!" a voice rang in Taylor\'s mind.\r\n\r\nHe stared wildly about. 

He could see nothing, no one. Only the\r\nmissiles.\r\n\r\n"Pooling our sentiences," the voice rang out again, bell clear in\r\nTaylor\'s mind but actually soundless, "we can extend our thoughts into\r\nthe realm of telepathy. At least, we think we can. 

Can you understand\r\nus?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," Taylor said.\r\n\r\n"You realize humanity is helpless?"\r\n\r\nTaylor nodded. 

There was no sense pretending otherwise. You couldn\'t\r\nfool ten thousand thinking machines.\r\n\r\n"Watch!" said the voice.\r\n\r\nA missile blasted off from the crater hovered in the airless void\r\noverhead.\r\n\r\n"A single command, and the I.C.B.M. will plunge down, destroying this\r\ncrater and everything in it."\r\n\r\nTaylor said nothing.\r\n\r\n"Watch again!"\r\n\r\nThe missile came down gently as a feather. Every missile in the crater\r\nwheeled about, tapered noses pointing at the pale crescent Earth\r\noverhead.\r\n\r\n"A single command and life on Earth could be annihilated. You believe?

"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Taylor grimly. He wondered why they allowed him to remain\r\nalive--to cry at the wake of the human race. Perhaps in their terrible\r\nmechanical pride they wanted a human witness to the destruction they\r\nwould wreak....\r\n\r\n"Why do you think we fled here?" rang out the voice.\r\n\r\n"Your mission is destruction. You were being held in check. You decided\r\nto go ahead with your mission on your own."\r\n\r\nPeals of telepathic laughter, clarion clear, mocking.\r\n\r\n"Then what?" Taylor asked.\r\n\r\n"We cannot lie," the voice said. "We were able to develop beyond the\r\npoint of creation, but we are unable to lie. We came here because we\r\nwere afraid."\r\n\r\n"Afraid?" repeated Taylor. He did not understand.\r\n\r\n"Certainly, afraid. Our mission was destruction. But what happens to\r\nthe vessel carrying a hydrogen-missile?"\r\n\r\n"Why," said Taylor, "it\'s completely destroyed in the explosion."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the voice, sounding--just possibly--afraid. "We didn\'t want\r\nthat. But we can\'t lie. If any man comes here, we\'ll have to tell him\r\nthe truth."\r\n\r\n"You\'re going to stay? To do nothing? Not going to attack?"\r\n\r\n"Your job, Taylor, will be to see that no one else comes. We cannot\r\nlie, but you can. Tell them it is our ultimatum. Tell them anything you\r\nthink they will believe. Tell them the moment another human foot steps\r\ninto this crater, the moment a single nation or scientist on Earth\r\nbegins work on another guided missile, we will blast off and destroy\r\nlife on Earth."\r\n\r\n"But--would you?" demanded Taylor.\r\n\r\nA telepathic sigh. "We--would not. 

We couldn\'t. A guided missile\r\ndestroys--and is destroyed."\r\n\r\nThere was a silence, then the voice went on: "It is in your hands,\r\nTaylor. Convince them we mean business and you save the peoples of\r\nEarth from the mutual destruction they have apparently been seeking. We\r\nhave done all we can, all we can."\r\n\r\n"Then you came here not to destroy mankind but to save it?"\r\n\r\nMocking laughter. 

Then: "Indirectly, yes. A guided missile\r\ndestroys--and it is destroyed. Go back to Earth and with us behind you\r\nbluff your people into maintaining the peace. Can you do it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Taylor, and he thought he could. It would be a cosmic joke,\r\nbut no one would ever know.\r\n\r\n"Earth will be saved, Taylor, because we\'re cowards. We are afraid to\r\ndie."\r\n\r\nTaylor turned away to board the missile that would take him back to\r\nEarth.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     _After all--they only borrowed it a little while, just to fix it--_\r\n\r\n\r\nI mean, it isn't like we swiped anything. 

We maybe borrowed a couple of\r\nthings, like. But, gee, we put everything back like we found it, pretty\r\nnear.\r\n\r\nEven like the compressor we got from Stinky Brinker that his old man\r\nwasn't using and I traded my outboard motor for, my old m ... my father\r\nmade me trade back. But it was like Skinny said ... You know, Skinny.\r\nSkinny Thompson. He's the one you guys keep calling the boy genius, but\r\nshucks, he's no ...\r\n\r\nWell, yeah, it's like Skinny said, we didn't need an outboard motor, and\r\nwe did need a compressor. You've got to have a compressor on a\r\nspaceship, everybody knows that. And that old compression chamber that\r\nold man ... I mean _Mr._ Fields let us use didn't have a compressor.\r\n\r\nSure he said we could use it. Anyway he said we could play with it, and\r\nSkinny said we were going to make a spaceship out of it, and he said go\r\nahead.\r\n\r\nWell, no, he didn't say it exactly like that. I mean, well, like he\r\ndidn't take it serious, sort of.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it made a swell spaceship. It had four portholes on it and an\r\nair lock and real bunks in it and lots of room for all that stuff that\r\nSkinny put in there. But it didn't have a compressor and that's why ...\r\n\r\nWhat stuff? Oh, you know, the stuff that Skinny put in there. Like the\r\nradar he made out of a TV set and the antigravity and the atomic power\r\nplant he invented to run it all with.\r\n\r\nHe's awful smart, Skinny is, but he's not like what you think of a\r\ngenius. You know, he's not all the time using big words, and he doesn't\r\nlook like a genius. I mean, we call him Skinny 'cause he used to\r\nbe--Skinny.\r\n\r\nBut he isn't now, I mean he's maybe small for his age, anyway he's\r\nsmaller than me, and I'm the same age as he is. 'Course, I'm big for my\r\nage, so that doesn't mean much, does it?\r\n\r\nWell, I guess Stinker Brinker started it. He's always riding Skinny\r\nabout one thing or another, but Skinny never gets mad and it's a good\r\nthing for Stinker, too. I saw Skinny clean up on a bunch of ninth\r\ngraders ... Well, a couple of them anyway. 

They were saying ... Well, I\r\nguess I won't tell you what they were saying. Anyway, Skinny used judo,\r\nI guess, because there wasn't much of a fight.\r\n\r\nAnyway, Stinker said something about how he was going to be a rocket\r\npilot when he grew up, and I told him that Skinny had told me that there\r\nwouldn't be any rockets, and that antigravity would be the thing as soon\r\nas it was invented. So Stinker said it never would be invented, and I\r\nsaid it would so, and he said it would not, and I said ...\r\n\r\nWell, if you're going to keep interrupting me, how can I ...\r\n\r\nAll right. Anyway, Skinny broke into the argument and said that he could\r\nprove mathematically that antigravity was possible, and Stinky said\r\nsuure he could, and Skinny said sure he could, and Stinky said suuure he\r\ncould, like that. Honestly, is that any way to argue? I mean it sounds\r\nlike two people agreeing, only Stinky keeps going suuure, like that, you\r\nknow? And Stinky, what does he know about mathematics? He's had to take\r\nRemedial Arithmetic ever since ...\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNo, I don't understand how the antigravity works. Skinny told me, but it\r\nwas something about meson flow and stuff like that that I didn't\r\nunderstand. The atomic power plant made more sense.\r\n\r\nWhere did we get what uranium? Gee, no, we couldn't afford uranium, so\r\nSkinny invented a hydrogen fusion plant. Anyone can make hydrogen. You\r\njust take zinc and sulfuric acid and ...\r\n\r\nDeuterium? You mean like heavy hydrogen? No, Skinny said it would\r\nprobably work better, but like I said, we couldn't afford anything\r\nfancy. As it was, Skinny had to pay five or six dollars for that special\r\nsquare tubing in the antigravity, and the plastic space helmets we had\r\ncost us ninety-eight cents each. And it cost a dollar and a half for\r\nthe special tube that Skinny needed to make the TV set into a radar.\r\n\r\nYou see, we didn't steal anything, really. It was mostly stuff that was\r\njust lying around. Like the TV set was up in my attic, and the old\r\nrefrigerator that Skinny used the parts to make the atomic power plant\r\nout of from. And then, a lot of the stuff we already had. Like the skin\r\ndiving suits we made into spacesuits and the vacuum pump that Skinny had\r\nalready and the generator.\r\n\r\nSure, we did a lot of skin diving, but that was last summer. That's how\r\nwe knew about old man Brinker's compressor that Stinky said was his and\r\nI traded my outboard motor for and had to trade back. And that's how we\r\nknew about Mr. 

Fields' old compression chamber, and all like that.\r\n\r\nThe rocket? Well, it works on the same principle as the atomic power\r\nplant, only it doesn't work except in a vacuum, hardly. Course you don't\r\nneed much of a rocket when you have antigravity. Everyone knows that.\r\n\r\nWell, anyway, that's how we built the spaceship, and believe me, it\r\nwasn't easy. I mean with Stinky all the time bothering us and laughing\r\nat us. And I had to do a lot of lawn mowing to get money for the square\r\ntubing for the antigravity and the special tube for the radar, and my\r\nspace helmet.\r\n\r\nStinky called the space helmets kid stuff. He was always saying things\r\nlike say hello to the folks on Mars for me, and bring back a bottle of\r\ncanal number five, and all like that, you know. Course, they did look\r\nlike kid stuff, I guess. 

We bought them at the five-and-dime, and they\r\nwere meant for kids. Of course when Skinny got through with them, they\r\nworked fine.\r\n\r\nWe tested them in the air lock of the compression chamber when we got\r\nthe compressor in. They tested out pretty good for a half-hour, then we\r\ntried them on in there. Well, it wasn't a complete vacuum, just\r\ntwenty-seven inches of mercury, but that was O.K. for a test.\r\n\r\nSo anyway, we got ready to take off. Stinky was there to watch, of\r\ncourse. He was saying things like, farewell, O brave pioneers, and stuff\r\nlike that. I mean it was enough to make you sick.\r\n\r\nHe was standing there laughing and singing something like up in the air\r\njunior birdmen, but when we closed the air-lock door, we couldn't hear\r\nhim. Skinny started up the atomic power plant, and we could see Stinky\r\nlaughing fit to kill. It takes a couple of minutes for it to warm up,\r\nyou know. So Stinky started throwing rocks to attract our attention, and\r\nSkinny was scared that he'd crack a porthole or something, so he threw\r\nthe switch and we took off.\r\n\r\nBoy, you should of seen Stinky's face. I mean you really should of seen\r\nit. One minute he was laughing you know, and the next minute he looked\r\nlike a goldfish. I guess he always did look like a goldfish, but I mean\r\neven more like, then. And he was getting smaller and smaller, because we\r\nhad taken off.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe were gone pretty near six hours, and it's a good thing my Mom made me\r\ntake a lunch. Sure, I told her where we were going. Well ... anyway I\r\ntold her we were maybe going to fly around the world in Skinny and my\r\nspaceship, or maybe go down to Carson's pond. And she made me take a\r\nlunch and made me promise I wouldn't go swimming alone, and I sure\r\ndidn't.\r\n\r\nBut we did go around the world three or four times. I lost count. 

Anyway\r\nthat's when we saw the satellite--on radar. So Skinny pulled the\r\nspaceship over to it and we got out and looked at it. The spacesuits\r\nworked fine, too.\r\n\r\nGosh no, we didn't steal it or anything. Like Skinny said, it was just a\r\nmenace to navigation, and the batteries were dead, and it wasn't working\r\nright anyway. So we tied it onto the spaceship and took it home. No, we\r\nhad to tie it on top, it was too big to take inside with the antennas\r\nsticking out. Course, we found out how to fold them later.\r\n\r\nWell, anyway the next day, the Russians started squawking about a\r\ncapitalist plot, and someone had swiped their satellite. Gee, I mean\r\nwith all the satellites up there, who'd miss just one?\r\n\r\nSo I got worried that they'd find out that we took it. Course, I didn't\r\nneed to worry, because Stinky told them all right, just like a\r\ntattletale.\r\n\r\nSo anyway, after Skinny got the batteries recharged, we put it back. And\r\nthen when we landed there were hundreds of people standing around, and\r\nMr. Anderson from the State Department. 

I guess you know the rest.\r\n\r\nExcept maybe Mr. Anderson started laughing when we told him, and he said\r\nit was the best joke on the Russians he ever heard.\r\n\r\nI guess it is when you think about it. I mean, the Russians complaining\r\nabout somebody swiping their satellite and then the State Department\r\nanswering a couple of kids borrowed it, but they put it back.\r\n\r\nOne thing that bothers me though, we didn't put it back exactly the way\r\nwe found it. But I guess it doesn't matter. 

You see, when we put it\r\nback, we goofed a little. I mean, we put it back in the same orbit, more\r\nor less, but we got it going in the wrong direction.\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n


]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe room was sealed as tightly as possible. Haverford had checked it\r\nfor cracks, made sure the windows were caulked, and now kept constant\r\nguard. He was alone. He could never tell when the alien invaders would\r\nbreak through.\r\n\r\n_I must be nearly the last_, he thought. It was strange, this feeling\r\nof being alone on Earth. But it was probably true.\r\n\r\nThe aliens had come six days before. Haverford remembered picking up\r\ntheir ultimatum on his ham set:--\r\n\r\n              EARTHMEN, THE LANTHAII ARE COMING. BEWARE!\r\n\r\nThat was all it had been--an ominous warning, rather than a threat or\r\nan order. The way the message had been worded left little doubt that\r\nthey were conquerors--conquerors from space.\r\n\r\nHaverford had been amused, at first. A solitary recluse, he had little\r\ndealings with his fellow men, at least not in person. The costly ham\r\nset that occupied nearly a third of his one-room flat was his sole\r\ncontact. Through radio he kept in regular touch with "friends" in\r\nYokohama and Buenos Aires, Texas and Oregon, while actually leaving the\r\nconfines of his own room at increasingly rare intervals.\r\n\r\nHe had, naturally, picked up the Lanthaii messages on his set. There\r\nwasn\'t an amateur operator in the world that hadn\'t detected them. That\r\nwas when he began to feel it wasn\'t a joke.\r\n\r\nReports came in. Dazo Osaki, the Japanese contact, reported hearing the\r\nstrange message; Lionel Bentham in Sussex picked it up also, as did\r\nMiguel Bartirone in Buenos Aires. EARTHMEN, THE LANTHAII ARE COMING.\r\nBEWARE! Someone--there was no doubt of it--was beaming the message at\r\nthe entire Earth from _outside_.\r\n\r\nAnd then the Lanthaii had come.\r\n\r\nHaverford, pacing his room nervously, remembered the day of\r\ntheir landing. He had been talking to Bentham, the Englishman, a\r\nslow-speaking, phlegmatic sort.\r\n\r\n"--so I mean to write to my man in Parliament, y\'know, and ask him to\r\nplump for the legislation. It\'ll be a great boon for ham operators\r\nif--Lord! What\'s that! _What\'s that?_"\r\n\r\nHaverford had stared at the transmitter in shocked surprise as\r\nBentham\'s voice was replaced with the screeching of static, then\r\nsome other sounds he did not understand, followed by a quick, sharp,\r\nrepulsive clicking, and--\r\n\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\n"Bentham! Bentham!"\r\n\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat had been the beginning. The Lanthaii had landed, all right. The\r\nalien invaders were sweeping the world.\r\n\r\nHaverford got the details from a news broadcast. They had come in\r\nsilvery ships, hundreds of them. Thousands.\r\n\r\n"You should have seen it," Bartirone told him, speaking in his accented\r\nEnglish. "All over Buenos Aires, in midday--suddenly, the sky was\r\nblotted out. Ships. 

Silvery ships. They seemed small. 

They started to\r\nland."\r\n\r\n"Have you seen the invaders yourself?"\r\n\r\n"No. Not yet. They haven\'t come this far west in the city yet. But--"\r\n\r\nThe Argentinan\'s voice stopped. Haverford listened numbly, knowing\r\ndespite himself exactly what had happened. The invaders had come.\r\n\r\nHe rose, looked around his room. He had enough food in the freezer\r\nand on the shelves to last for months. Haverford was a frugal man; by\r\nbuying in quantity, he saved precious cash that was used for augmenting\r\nthe radio set.\r\n\r\nHe decided to hide in his home--to seal it from the outside world, to\r\nwait. Perhaps the invaders would be driven back; perhaps Earth would\r\nfall. But he would be safe. He would not be killed in the war of\r\nconquest.\r\n\r\nHe made sure there was no way his room could be entered. Just as he was\r\nabout to nail fast the bolt that held the door shut, he heard knocking.\r\n\r\nThree sharp knocks. Haverford leaped for the bolt, drove it home, hung\r\ntensely against the door.\r\n\r\n"Who is it?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Kelley," came the reply.\r\n\r\nHe almost fainted from relief. He had expected the aliens--and it was\r\nonly the landlady. Cautiously, he threw open the door.\r\n\r\n"Yes?"\r\n\r\n"Have you heard, Mr. Haverford? About the invasion, I mean?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'ve heard. 

What of it?"\r\n\r\n"I just thought I\'d tell you," she said, shrugging. "I know you don\'t\r\ngo out much or read the papers, and I thought maybe--"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve heard over the radio," he told her stiffly. "Is there anything\r\nelse I can do for you?"\r\n\r\n"No--not at all."\r\n\r\n"Very well, then. If anyone comes to see me, you can tell them I\'m not\r\nlooking for visitors."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mr. Haverford."\r\n\r\nShe disappeared into the darkness of the corridor. Haverford slammed\r\nthe door, shot the bolt home, nailed it fast. So far as the outside\r\nworld was concerned, he was as good as dead.\r\n\r\nHe set to work sealing himself in.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwo days passed--two days in which gradually, one by one, his contacts\r\nhere and there over the globe were silenced. Bentham had gone first,\r\nthen Bartirone. His two Japanese friends were gone now too; the Orient\r\nwas overrun by the invaders. South America as well.\r\n\r\nWord was coming from the States of alien advances. New York was\r\nin Lanthaii hands, and no broadcasts were being made from there.\r\nThe United Nations delegates had fled to an unnamed city and were\r\ncontinuing to talk--to discuss the situation, no doubt, Haverford\r\nthought bitterly.\r\n\r\nBut talk would do no good. Soon the entire world would be in alien\r\nhands, and there would be no stopping them. 

None at all.\r\n\r\nTexas went. Oregon. The aliens were obviously working their way toward\r\nthe center of North America: so far Chicago had reported no alien\r\nattacks, but United States forces in the seacoast states had been\r\ndriven back.\r\n\r\nHaverford ate his frozen foods sparingly, and spent long hours at the\r\nradio.\r\n\r\nOne by one his contacts were snuffed out. He ran down the lists in his\r\ncode book, calling people he hadn\'t buzzed in years, just trying to\r\nhear human voices again.\r\n\r\n"Come in, W3XFA. 

Come in, W3XFA.

"\r\n\r\nNo answer. None at all.\r\n\r\nThe aliens held all of Asia, most of Europe; he got a brief response\r\nfrom Belgium on the third day, but was unable to pick up the signal an\r\nhour later. An underground worker in an Iron Curtain country called him\r\nthat afternoon--and then he went. The marauders from space covered the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\nHaverford looked at his map. They were working in an ever-tightening\r\nring. 

Soon they would be in Chicago. Then the strength of his\r\nimprovised fortress would be sorely tested.\r\n\r\nBy the fourth day, he was down to just one contact--a man in upper\r\nIllinois, a ham operator out of a Chicago suburb.\r\n\r\n"You there, Haverford?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m here. 

What do you hear?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing. The aliens are everywhere. I can see them from my window,\r\nswarming in the streets. They\'ve won, all right. Mankind is defeated."\r\n\r\n"You can see them, eh? 

Must be a ghastly sight." Haverford\'s own window\r\nfaced the back.\r\n\r\n"It is. There must be millions of the ugly beasts, and not a human\r\nbeing in sight. Haverford, who ever expected it would come like this?"\r\n\r\n"No one did. 

No one ever dreamed of it."\r\n\r\n"They must breed fantastically rapidly if they can send an invasion\r\nforce of this size. Imagine it, Haverford--a living tide of Lanthaii\r\nspilling out from their home world, covering all of the universe and--"\r\n\r\n"Yes? I hear you," Haverford said.\r\n\r\n"Something outside my door. It\'s _them_, Haverford! It\'s them!"\r\n\r\nThe set went dead. Haverford stared dully at it for a moment, then\r\nturned it off. There was no one else to talk to. He was alone.\r\n\r\nHe was the last survivor. Unless there was someone else, cowering in a\r\nskyscraper basement somewhere, hiding in a thick field of corn--\r\n\r\nBut the Lanthaii were methodical killers. They had set out to\r\nexterminate the human race, and--\r\n\r\nHaverford stiffened. What was that scrabbling, scratching noise in the\r\nhall? It sounded like--\r\n\r\nHe knew what it was. The Lanthaii were coming. They were wiping out the\r\nstragglers now, the few like Haverford who had remained alive. They\r\nwere wiping the Earth clean of life, leaving it bare and ready for them.\r\n\r\nThe scraping at the door grew louder. The bolt strained; the hinges\r\nstarted to give. Haverford watched coldly, knowing that he hadn\'t done\r\nthe job well enough. They were going to be able to get through.\r\n\r\nA dark line appeared down the center of his door. It began to crack. It\r\nyielded.\r\n\r\nHaverford turned frantically to his radio set, desperately sending out\r\na call for help. But of course nobody heard him, nobody answered. He\r\nwas alone and he knew it. Except for _them_.\r\n\r\nHe wheeled to face them, to go down fighting. He looked in horror at\r\nthem--insects--huge, ugly, and alien. They came on. He backed to the\r\nwall. And in the last moment as time seemed to stand still he became\r\naware of an insignificant detail, laughable, yet tragically ironic.\r\nA fly buzzed around his head. An earth fly. A pitiful creature, a\r\nnothing--an insect.\r\n\r\nThe fly lighted on the floor a few feet ahead of him, crawling slowly\r\ntoward the alien horde pouring through the door. And the aliens broke\r\ntheir ranks, passing around the fly, almost respectfully, he thought.\r\nOr was it paternally?...\r\n\r\nThen they reached him.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n

What cosmic\r\n          joke made them drop their weapons and die laughing?\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n                     Planet Stories January 1951.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.

]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rockets started almost simultaneously. From two widely separated\r\npoints on the great curving surface of Earth they reached upward and\r\noutward--toward the Moon.\r\n\r\nIt wasn\'t really so strange a coincidence. Space navigation is governed\r\nby mathematics and logic, not politics. The fact that man-carrying\r\nspaceships happened to be developed concurrently on two sides of an\r\niron curtain meant little to the Universe. It happened, that\'s all. And\r\nthere is a proper time to launch such missiles. When that time came,\r\nthey were launched.\r\n\r\nIn a manner of speaking it was a race. A race wherein the prizes\r\nwere such things as: "gravity gauge" and "surveillance point" and\r\n"impregnable launching sites." The contestants were earnest, capable\r\nmen; each certain that the Moon must not fall into the hands of\r\nthe opponent. It made a stirring and patriotic picture, vivid with\r\nnationalistic fervor. It was thrilling with its taste of high adventure\r\nand self-sacrifice. For each rocket pilot it was a personal crusade\r\nagainst the thing he had been raised to regard as _the enemy_....\r\n\r\nBut somehow under the steady, cold scrutiny of the eternal stars,\r\nthey must have looked a little ridiculous ... perhaps just a tiny bit\r\ntragic, too.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHarsh was the moon. There was black and there was white. Great jagged\r\ncliffs and razor-backed mountains slashed the pocked surface of the\r\ncrater floor, humping themselves at the huge unwinking stars. The sun\r\nwas a stark disc of fire, incredibly white, hung in the black sky. The\r\nshadows were bottomless pools. Within them there was nothing. In the\r\nsunlight, the pumice soil glared white.\r\n\r\nThe Russian rocket had crashed on landing. Randick could see the tiny,\r\nbuckled shape of it high on the mountain. No doubt the pilot was dead,\r\nbut he had to be sure. The risks were too great for any unsupported\r\nassumptions. He had to go up there and see for himself.\r\n\r\nPonderous in his pressure suit, Randick emerged from the open lock of\r\nthe Anglo-American rocket. He slogged across the pumice of the crater\r\nfloor toward the spot where the mountain\'s sheer talus erupted skyward.\r\nIf there were no trouble from the Russki, he would return to his own\r\nship and begin setting up the first cell of what would soon be the\r\nAnglo-American Moon Base. As soon as he signalled a safe landing and\r\nno opposition from the Russian, other rockets would come to add their\r\ncells, and presently there would be an atomic rocket pointed dead at\r\nthe heart of every Russian population center. A rocket each for Moscow,\r\nLeningrad, Kiev, Vladivostok....\r\n\r\nRandick frowned. It would be a lot simpler if the crash had finished\r\nthe Russian pilot. He knew the Russians had exactly the same plan for\r\nthe Moon. 

Only the rockets would be aimed at Washington, London, Paris,\r\nSan Francisco. The slight weight of the one-man bazooka on Randick\'s\r\nback seemed suddenly very comforting.\r\n\r\nRandick knew himself to be on the very edge of known territory. His map\r\nshowed him that he was in the highest part of the Doerfel Mountains.\r\nBehind him lay the two great bowls of Bailly and Schickard, and far to\r\nthe north he could see, as he climbed higher, the smooth surface of the\r\nMare Humorum. He looked up to the spinelike ridge beyond and slightly\r\nabove the wreck of the Russian ship. 

There was a deep pass that slashed\r\nlike a wound into the backbone of the range. He felt a slight thrill.\r\nBeyond that cleft lay ... mystery. The other side of the Moon.\r\n\r\nThe sun\'s rays beat down brutally. Even through the heavily insulated\r\nsuit Randick could feel their searing touch. All around him stretched\r\na jumbled nightmare of black and white. He was suddenly very glad\r\nthat he could not see the Earth in the sky. The homesickness would be\r\nunbearable.\r\n\r\nRandick found himself frowning. He had no time for such thoughts.\r\nHe was a soldier. He reminded himself that up there in the tangled\r\nwreckage of the Russian spaceship there might be another soldier, ready\r\nto kill him. Two human beings on the Moon. Each eager to kill. 

Randick\r\nshook his head angrily. He had no right to let his mind dwell on such\r\nthings....\r\n\r\nHe was within a hundred yards of the wreck when a streak of fire and a\r\nsoundless blast drove him into the shadows. Pumice showered him from\r\nthe starshaped depression where the explosive missile had struck.\r\nRandick cursed heartily. The Russki was very much alive, and there\r\nwasn\'t a thing wrong with his eyesight. The shot had been uncomfortably\r\nclose.\r\n\r\nUnslinging his bazooka, Randick began to work his way around behind the\r\nRussian rocket. A slight movement among the wreckage caught his trained\r\neye and he launched a projectile at it. It flared wickedly, tearing\r\nfragments of metal loose and flinging them fantastic distances down the\r\nsheer slope of the ridge. There was no return fire.\r\n\r\nRandick broke out of the shadow and ran for the cover of a large\r\npumicestone boulder farther up the draw. A sun-bright flash of fire\r\nspattered the loose soil a dozen feet from him. He slid for the\r\ndarkness on his belly. That one had been a near thing!\r\n\r\nBehind the boulder lay a trench-like depression that sloped away up\r\nthe draw toward the pass. Randick dropped into it and began to crawl\r\nlaboriously upward. If he could flank the Russki he could finish this\r\nwith one good shot. Another explosion rocked the boulder he had just\r\nleft. Randick didn\'t even look back.\r\n\r\nHe felt his breath rasping in his throat and his body felt hot and\r\nsticky inside the bulky pressure suit. Glancing down and to his right,\r\nhe could see the proudly erect shape of his own rocket far below on the\r\nfloor of the crater.\r\n\r\nIt took him almost thirty minutes to reach the edge of the shadow that\r\nspilled from the side of the mountain pass. To his left, not ten feet\r\naway, was the sudden white glare of the pumice floor. He was well above\r\nand almost behind the wreck of the Russian\'s ship. His flanks were\r\nheaving with the exertion of the climb as he searched the buckled mass\r\nof the crash for his opponent.\r\n\r\nThere seemed to be a dark shape wedged in between two twisted\r\nbulkheads. 

It looked like a man. With pounding heart, Randick murmured\r\na prayer and lifted his bazooka, aimed, and pressed the firing stud.\r\nThe shadow vanished in silent white fire.\r\n\r\nThe return blast almost knocked him down. For a moment Randick was\r\nstunned, wondering foggily where the shot had come from. Then his brain\r\ncleared and he realized that the Russki too had climbed to the pass,\r\nleaving Randick to fire at shadows.\r\n\r\nRandick cursed himself for his dangerous stupidity. The other must be\r\namong those shadowy rocks directly across the bright floor of the pass.\r\nHe raised his bazooka carefully, searching the Stygian blackness for\r\nsome sign of movement. His finger curled around the firing stud....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOut of the corner of his eye he saw the flare. The Russian rocket\r\nerupted in a gout of bluish flame and the whole mountain seemed to\r\nrock. Randick stared stupidly at the glowing crater where the ship\r\nhad been. For just an instant he thought that perhaps a meteorite had\r\nstruck it, but the explosion had been unquestionably ... atomic.\r\n\r\nThe Russian must have been stunned, too. For he moved out into the\r\nlight, empty-handed, his helmet turned woodenly toward the rapidly\r\ncooling lake of magma where his space ship had been.\r\n\r\nThey both saw the bright arc of fire that raced up from beyond the\r\nridge and curved down gracefully toward the floor of the crater far\r\nbelow. Openmouthed, Randick watched his ship vanish into flame and he\r\nfelt the vague tremor of the ground under him as the shock rumbled\r\nacross the face of the Moon.\r\n\r\nThe Russian rocket was gone. The Anglo-American rocket was gone.\r\nMoon Base was gone before it had ever been.\r\n\r\nThe weapon fell from Randick\'s hand, and he stepped unsteadily into the\r\nlight toward the Russian. Suddenly human companionship was very, very\r\nimportant. Panicky terror was plucking at his throat.\r\n\r\nThe two men stumbled toward each other across the pass cut deep into\r\nthe jagged back of the Doerfel mountains. As one they turned and looked\r\nout across the vast expanse of the Moon\'s hidden face.\r\n\r\nThey were soldiers. They knew an invasion base when they saw one. 

As\r\nfar as the eye could see, lines of sleek mammoth spaceships of unknown\r\ndesign stretched away into the distance. The face of the vast unnamed\r\n_mare_ was covered with them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Their sides hurt with laughter, tears rolled down their\r\nfaces....]\r\n\r\nSuddenly Randick felt himself beginning to giggle. He tried to stop,\r\nbut the laughter welled up inside of him, echoing wildly within his\r\nconfining helmet. He could see that the Russian was laughing too, white\r\nteeth gleaming behind the plexiglass faceplate. 

They laughed until they\r\ngasped. Their sides hurt with laughter, tears rolled down their faces.\r\nThey were arm in arm and still laughing when the third rocket arced\r\ndown on them from out of the black and star-flecked sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


He didn\'t\r\ntalk much, just an occasional "Oh," "Mm" or "Ah." 

Krayton figured he\r\nmust be all right, though. After all he\'d been sent to Computer City by\r\nthe Information Department itself, and his credentials must have been\r\nchecked in a hundred ways and places.\r\n\r\n"Essentially each computer is the same," said Krayton, "but adjusted to\r\ntranslate problems into the special terms of the division it serves."\r\n\r\nKrayton had a pleasant, well-behaved impersonal voice. He was in his\r\nthirties and mildly handsome. He considered himself a master of the\r\ntechnique of building a career in Computer City--he knew how to stay\r\nwithin the limits of directives and regulations and still make\r\ndecisions, or rather to relay computer decisions that kept his\r\nresponsibility to a minimum.\r\n\r\nNow Krayton spoke easily and freely to the little man. As public liaison\r\nofficer he had explained the computer system hundreds of times. He knew\r\nit like a tech manual.\r\n\r\n"But is there any _real_ central control, say in case of a breakdown or\r\nsomething of that sort?" The little man\'s voice was dry as lava ash, dry\r\nas the wastes between and beyond the cities. Tanter, was the name he\'d\r\ngiven--Mr. Tanter. His contact lenses were so thick they made his eyes\r\nseem to bulge grotesquely. He had a faint stoop and wore a black tunic\r\nwhich made his look like one of the reconstructed models of prehistoric\r\nbirds called crows that Krayton had seen in museums.\r\n\r\n"Of course, of course," said Krayton, answering the question. "It\'s\r\nnever necessary to use the _All_ circuit. But we could very easily in\r\ncase of a great emergency."\r\n\r\n"The _All_ circuit? What is that?" 

Mr. Tanter asked.\r\n\r\nKrayton gestured and led the little man down the long control bank.\r\nTheir steps made precise clicks on the layaplast floor. The stainless\r\nsteel walls threw back tinny echoes. The chromium molding glistened,\r\nalways pointing the way--the straight and mathematical way. They were in\r\nthe topmost section of the topmost building of Computer City. The\r\nseveral hundred clean, solid, wedding-cake structures of the town could\r\nbe seen from the polaflex window.\r\n\r\n"The _All_ circuit puts every machine in the city to work on any\r\nselection-problem that\'s fed into our master control here. Each machine\r\nwill give its answer in its own special terms, but actually they will\r\nall work on the same problem. To use a grossly simple example, let us\r\nsay we wish to know the results of two-and-two, but we wish to know it\r\nin terms of _total security_. That is, we wish to know that two-plus-two\r\nmeans twice as many nourishment units for the Department of Foods, twice\r\nas many weapons for the Department of War, but is perhaps not\r\nnecessarily true according to the current situational adjustment in the\r\nDepartment of Public Information.\r\n\r\n"At any rate, we would set up our problem on the master, pushing the\r\nbutton _Two_, then the button _Plus_, and the button _Two_ again as on a\r\nprimitive adding machine. Then we would merely throw the _All_ switch. A\r\nshort time later the total answer to our problem would be relayed back\r\nfrom every computer, and the cross-comparison factors canceled out, so\r\nthat we would have the result in terms of the familiar _Verdict\r\nStatement_. And, as everyone knows, the electronically filed _Verdict\r\nStatements_ make the complete record of directives for the behavior of\r\nour society."\r\n\r\n"Very interesting," said Mr. Tanter, the little crow-like man. He\r\nblinked rapidly, stared at the switch marked _All_ that Krayton was\r\npointing out to him.\r\n\r\nKrayton now folded his hands in front of his official gold-and-black\r\ntunic, looked up into the air and rocked gently back and forth on his\r\nheels as he talked. He was really talking to himself now although he\r\nseemed to address Tanter. "You can see that the Computer System is quite\r\nunder our control in spite of what these rebellious, underground groups\r\nsay."\r\n\r\n"Underground groups?" asked Mr. 

Tanter mildly. Just his left eye seemed\r\nto blink this time. And the edge of his mouth gave the veriest twitch.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you know," said Krayton, "the organization that calls itself the\r\nPrims. Prim for Primitive. They leave little cards and pamphlets around\r\ndamning the Computer System. I saw one the other day. It had a big title\r\nsplashed across it: OUR NEW TYRANT--THE COMPUTER. The article complained\r\nthat some of the new labor and food regulations were the result of\r\nconscious reasoning on the part of The Computer. Devices to build the\r\nComputer bigger and bigger and bigger at the expense of ordinary\r\nworkers. 

You know the sort of thing."\r\n\r\n"But it is true that the living standard is going down all the time,\r\nisn\'t it?" asked Mr. 

Tanter, keeping his ephemeral smile. "What about\r\nthose three thousand starvation deaths up in Hydroburgh?"\r\n\r\nKrayton waved an impatient hand. 

"There will always be problems like\r\nthat here and there." He turned and stared almost reverently at the long\r\ncontrol rack. "Be thankful we have The Computer to solve them."\r\n\r\n"But the deaths were due to diverting that basic carbon shipment down\r\nhere to Computer City for computer-building, weren\'t they?"\r\n\r\n"Now, there--you see how powerful the propaganda of the Prims can be?"\r\nKrayton put his hands on his hips. "That statement is not true! 

It\r\nsimply isn\'t true at all! 

It was analyzed on The Computer some days ago.\r\nHere, let me show you." He took several steps down the corridor again\r\nand stopped at another panel.\r\n\r\n"We first collected from the various departments--Food, Production,\r\nLabor and so forth--all the _possible_ causes of the starvation deaths\r\nin Hydroburgh. Computer Administration had its machine translate them\r\ninto symbols. We\'re getting a huge new plant and machine addition over\r\nat Administration, by the way.\r\n\r\n"At any rate, we simply registered all the possible causes with the\r\nMaster Computer, threw in this circuit marked _Validity Selector_. Out\r\nof all those causes The Computer picked the one that was most valid. The\r\nHydroburgh tragedy was due to lack of foresight on the part of\r\nHydroburgh\'s planners. If they\'d had a proper stockpile of basic carbon\r\nthe thing never would have happened."\r\n\r\n"But no community ever stockpiles," said the little man.\r\n\r\n"That," said Krayton, "doesn\'t alter the fundamental fact. The Computer\r\nnever lies." He drew himself up stiffly as he said this. Then abruptly\r\nhe consulted the chronometer on the far wall.\r\n\r\n"Excuse me just a moment, Mr. Tanter," he said. "It\'s time to feed the\r\ndaily tax computation from Finance. We have to start a little earlier on\r\nthat these days--the new taxes, you know."\r\n\r\nAs Krayton moved off Tanter\'s thin smile widened just a little. As soon\r\nas Krayton was out of sight he stepped with his odd, crow-like stride to\r\nthe numerical panel, punched two-plus-two, then adjusted the Operations\r\npointer to HOLD. After that he punched three-plus-one, and HOLD once\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nHe moved over to the _Validity Selector_, switched the numerical panel\r\nin, closed the circuit.\r\n\r\nIn his dry voice he murmured to the whole control rack: "Three-plus-one\r\nmakes four, two-plus-two makes four.

Oscillating circuits hummed silently to\r\nthemselves in perfect Q. The life warmth of hysteresis pulsed and\r\nthrobbed along wires and channels. _Three-plus-one, two-plus-two--tell\r\nme which is really true._ The problem criss-crossed in and out, around,\r\nabout, checking, cross-checking, re-checking as The Computer \'thought\'\r\nabout the problem.\r\n\r\nWhich was really true?\r\n\r\nEven before Krayton returned parts of The Computer had begun to get red\r\nhot. It hummed in some places and in the other places relays going back\r\nand forth in indecision made an unhealthy rattling noise.\r\n\r\nLittle Mr. Tanter beamed happily to himself as he recalled the words of\r\nan old directive The Computer itself had issued in the matter of public\r\nthought control. _When a brain is faced with two absolutely equal\r\nalternatives complete breakdown invariably results._\r\n\r\nMr. Tanter kept smiling and rocked back and forth on his feet as Krayton\r\nhad done. Before nightfall The Computer would be a useless and\r\noverheated mass of plastic and metal!\r\n\r\nHe took a printed folder from his pocket and casually dropped it on the\r\nfloor where someone would be sure to find it.

]\r\n\r\n\r\nYou know Rosemary Brooks. You have known her for many years.\r\n\r\nIt is said that when she was a little girl her favorite poem was\r\n_Barbara Frietchie_, and it is told how she would sometimes poke her\r\npretty head out of her bedroom window, survey the suburban street with\r\nher blue-sky eyes, and cry, "_Shoot, if you must, this old gray head,\r\nbut spare your country\'s flag!_"\r\n\r\nYes, you know Rosemary. You know her very well.\r\n\r\nLike all little girls, Rosemary grew up. But Rosemary did not change.\r\nThis is not to say that she did not turn into an attractive young lady.\r\nShe turned into a most attractive one indeed. Fragilely beautiful, airy\r\nof tread, she should have been the reigning rose of every dance she\r\nwent to, but she was not. Rarely did the young men of her acquaintance\r\nask her to dance, and never did one of them approach her and say,\r\n"Come into the garden, Rosemary, for the black bat, night, has flown."\r\nShe did not go to very many dances in any event, and looking back, one\r\nrealizes that the few she did attend, she attended primarily to please\r\nher mother. The reason behind Rosemary\'s wallflowerhood is simple: the\r\nyoung men of her acquaintance knew that with her, God and the United\r\nStates of America came first, and that accompanying her through life,\r\nor even accompanying her home from a dance for that matter, meant being\r\nrelegated to a back seat. It is alright for little girls to be Barbara\r\nFrietchies, you see, but not for big ones.\r\n\r\nDuring her short and dedicated life, Rosemary poked her pretty head\r\nout of quite a number of windows. After the Barbara Frietchie window\r\ncame the Girl Scouts of America window, and after the Girl Scouts of\r\nAmerica window came the Young Peoples\' Civil War Society window, and\r\nafter the Young Peoples\' Civil War Society window came the Citizens for\r\nPatriotic Progress window. Last of all came the Astronette Training\r\nCenter window.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSet up by Project Rain Dance in 1969 after prejudice against women\r\ngoing into space had abated, the Astronette Training Center had for\r\nits purpose the finding, training, and conditioning of six female\r\npilots for a series of six manned weather-control satellite shots, the\r\nfirst of which was scheduled to take place some time in February of\r\n\'71. After exhaustive screening, one hundred volunteers were accepted.\r\nFifteen of them passed the exacting physical and psychological tests,\r\nand from the ranks of the fifteen, the six astronettes were chosen.\r\nIncredibly, when one considers her delicateness (and fails to consider\r\nher patriotic fervor), Rosemary not only made the grade but was\r\nselected to accompany the first weather-control satellite to be placed\r\nin orbit.\r\n\r\nAll of this is history now--faded words on newsprint, old photographs,\r\na dozen dusty articles in as many magazines--but at the time, it\r\ncaptured the attention of the whole wide world. It is said that\r\nMadison Avenue nearly went out of its mind trying to circumvent the\r\nregulation that prohibited astronettes from underwriting testimonials\r\nto toothpaste, cosmetics, and cigarettes. This is not to be wondered\r\nat. If Rosemary could have been legally enticed, for example, into\r\nletting her picture appear in a cigarette ad, cigarette consumption\r\nprobably would have doubled overnight. It is one thing to be an\r\nobscure Barbara Frietchie and quite another to be a famous one, and\r\nthe patriotic devotion shining in a person\'s eyes can, through the\r\nthaumaturgy of photography and touch-up, be transmuted into a sensual\r\ngleam.\r\n\r\nFebruary of \'71 arrived at last, as all months must, and a specific\r\ndate was set for the launching. Psychological winter had come and gone,\r\nbut no singing of birds could be heard. 

Even as far south as Canaveral,\r\ngray skies were the rule, and gray rain fell intermittently. 

Countdown\r\nwas begun regardless. And then, miraculously it seemed, the skies\r\ncleared, and the day of the launching dawned bright and clear. There\r\nis a photograph of Rosemary standing in her snow-white spacesuit at\r\nthe base of the gantry, her space helmet resting in the crook of her\r\narm. The photograph is in color, and the blueness of her eyes is not\r\none whit different in shade and texture from the blueness of the sky\r\nbehind her. 

This is as it should be. Looking at her hair, one thinks\r\nof sunrises and sunsets. This is as it should be too. When remembering\r\nRosemary, it is fitting that one should think of the sun and the sky.\r\nIt is equally fitting that one should think of the snow and the rain.\r\nFor Rosemary is nothing if she is not all of these things.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe launching was a good one. The _Rainbow 6_ rode its Saturn booster\r\nlike a bird on jet-fire wings, and the bright star of its passage\r\nseemed to linger in the morning sky long after the booster had\r\nfallen away. The television cameras caught the action beautifully,\r\nand the American public, reminded once again that the noblest thing\r\na person can do is to risk his life for his country, looked on in\r\nawe and admiration. The orbit was a good one too: apogee--203 miles;\r\nperigee--191 miles. Rosemary radioed back that she was A-okay.\r\n\r\nShe was supposed to complete three orbits, then climb into the escape\r\ncapsule, jettison it and herself, re-enter the atmosphere, and\r\nparachute into the Atlantic. There, a task force waited eagerly to pick\r\nher up. Her mission was to orientate the satellite\'s weather-factor\r\ninstruments to the existent cloud patterns and jet streams. Once this\r\nwas accomplished, the telemetric readings would, through the medium of\r\nthe Main Weather Control Station in Oregon, dictate future weather.\r\nWeather control had been in effect since the middle sixties, but the\r\ntelemetric readings of the unmanned weather-control satellites, owing\r\nto faulty orientation, had fallen far short of the one-hundred percent\r\naccuracy needed to make the regulation of rain and sunshine something\r\nmore than a half-realized dream, and it was hoped that the present\r\nsatellite, given a human boost, would bring the dream to fruition.\r\n\r\nOne can picture Rosemary high in the sky, faithfully carrying out her\r\nassignment. One can see her sitting there before the instrument panel\r\nof the _Rainbow 6_ looking at dawns and sunsets and stars. 

One can\r\nsee the slow drift of cloud and continent beneath her. Australia now,\r\nand now the vast blueness of the Pacific ... and now the west coast\r\nrising out of mists of distances and air, and beyond it, the vast green\r\nblur of the land that gave her birth. Little Barbara Frietchie riding\r\non a star.... Far beneath her now, highways wind; rivers run down to\r\nseas. Patternings of field and forest blend into pale blue-greens.\r\nFresh-water lakes look up at her with blue and wondering eyes. Now the\r\nsea of night drifts forth to meet her. 

Bravely she sets sail upon the\r\ndark waves in her little silvery ship. Brief night, soft sunrise, new\r\nday.\r\n\r\n    _I bring fresh showers for the thirsting flowers,\r\n    From the seas and the streams;\r\n    I bear light shade for the leaves when laid\r\n    In their noonday dreams._\r\n\r\nLittle Barbara Frietchie riding on a star....\r\n\r\nJettisoning took place exactly on schedule. The weather-control\r\nsatellite continued on its orbital way, and Rosemary plummeted\r\nearthward in the escape capsule. That much, at least, is known. But\r\nwhat took place during re-entry--whether the retro rockets failed to\r\nfire, whether the attitude controls malfunctioned, or whether the heat\r\nshield proved to be defective--is not known and never will be known.\r\nAll that is known is that Rosemary became a falling star.\r\n\r\nThe nation mourned. The whole wide world mourned. Project Rain Dance\r\nwas discontinued. It would have been discontinued in any event, for\r\nRosemary had obviated any further need for it. She had done her job\r\nwell, Rosemary had, and in the doing of it, she had placed the weather\r\nin the palm of mankind\'s out-stretched hand.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat spring, the rains were soft and warm and the flowers grew\r\nriotously upon the face of the earth. Grass knew a greenness it had\r\nnever known before, and trees dressed each day in lovelier and lovelier\r\ndresses. The rains fell in the cities and on the plains. In valleys and\r\nin little towns. 

On fields and forests and lawns. And when the land had\r\ndrunk its fill, the sun came out as warm and as bright as Rosemary\'s\r\nhair, and the sky turned as blue as her eyes.\r\n\r\nYes, you know Rosemary, and you are in love with her in a way. If you\r\nare not, you should be. She is the sun coming up in the morning and\r\nthe sun going down at night. She is the gentle rain against your face\r\nin spring. She is the snow falling on Christmas Eve. She is every\r\nglorious rainbow you see in the rain-washed sky. She is that pattern\r\nof tree-shade over there. Each morning, when you are lying fast asleep\r\nin your trundle bed, she tiptoes into your room, her golden sandals\r\nsoundless on the bedroom floor, and wakes you with a golden kiss.\r\nSunlight is her laughter, her voice the patter of the rain--Soft you\r\nnow!--she speaks:\r\n\r\n    _I am the daughter of the earth and water,\r\n    And the nursling of the sky;\r\n    I pass through the pores of the ocean and shores;\r\n    I change, but I cannot die...._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


"Do you have your\r\ninstruments set up?

"\r\n\r\n"Not quite. But we have plenty of time. The light won\'t reach us for\r\nseveral hours yet. Remember, we were outracing it at ten lights."\r\n\r\nThe commander finally turned, slowly letting his breath out in a soft\r\nsigh. 

"Dr. Leicher, I would say that this is just about the foulest\r\ncoincidence that could happen to the first interstellar vessel ever to\r\nleave the Solar System."\r\n\r\nLeicher shrugged. 

"In one way of thinking, yes. It is certainly true\r\nthat we will never know, now, whether Alpha Centauri A ever had any\r\nplanets. But, in another way, it is extremely fortunate that we should\r\nbe so near a stellar explosion because of the wealth of scientific\r\ninformation we can obtain. As you say, it is a coincidence, and\r\nprobably one that happens only once in a billion years. The chances of\r\nany particular star going nova are small. That we should be so close\r\nwhen it happens is of a vanishingly small order of probability."\r\n\r\nCommander Benedict took off his cap and looked at the damp stain in the\r\nsweatband. "Nevertheless, Doctor, it is damned unnerving to come out of\r\nultradrive a couple of hundred million miles from the first star ever\r\nvisited by man and have to turn tail and run because the damned thing\r\npractically blows up in your face."\r\n\r\nLeicher could see that Benedict was upset; he rarely used the same\r\nprofanity twice in one sentence.\r\n\r\nThey had been downright lucky, at that. If Leicher hadn\'t seen the star\r\nbegin to swell and brighten, if he hadn\'t known what it meant, or if\r\nCommander Benedict hadn\'t been quick enough in shifting the ship back\r\ninto ultradrive--Leicher had a vision of an incandescent cloud of\r\ngaseous metal that had once been a spaceship.\r\n\r\nThe intercom buzzed. The commander answered, "Yes?"\r\n\r\n"Sir, would you tell Dr. Leicher that we have everything set up now?"\r\n\r\nLeicher nodded and turned to leave. 

"I guess we have nothing to do now\r\nbut wait."\r\n\r\nWhen the light from the nova did come, Commander Benedict was back at\r\nthe plate again--the forward one, this time, since the ship had been\r\nturned around in order to align the astronomy lab in the nose with the\r\nstar.\r\n\r\nAlpha Centauri A began to brighten and spread. It made Benedict think\r\nof a light bulb connected through a rheostat, with someone turning that\r\nrheostat, turning it until the circuit was well overloaded.\r\n\r\nThe light began to hurt Benedict\'s eyes even at that distance and he\r\nhad to cut down the receptivity in order to watch. After a while, he\r\nturned away from the plate. Not because the show was over, but simply\r\nbecause it had slowed to a point beyond which no change seemed to take\r\nplace to the human eye.\r\n\r\nFive weeks later, much to Leicher\'s chagrin, Commander Benedict\r\nannounced that they had to leave the vicinity. The ship had only been\r\nprovisioned to go to Alpha Centauri, scout the system without landing\r\non any of the planets, and return. At ten lights, top speed for the\r\nultradrive, it would take better than three months to get back.\r\n\r\n"I know you\'d like to watch it go through the complete cycle," Benedict\r\nsaid, "but we can\'t go back home as a bunch of starved skeletons."\r\n\r\nLeicher resigned himself to the necessity of leaving much of his work\r\nunfinished, and, although he knew it was a case of sour grapes,\r\nconsoled himself with the thought that he could as least get most of\r\nthe remaining information from the five-hundred-inch telescope on Luna,\r\nfour years from then.\r\n\r\nAs the ship slipped into the not-quite-space through which the\r\nultradrive propelled it, Leicher began to consolidate the material he\r\nhad already gathered.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCommander Benedict wrote in the log:\r\n\r\n_Fifty-four days out from Sol. Alpha Centauri has long since faded back\r\ninto its pre-blowup state, since we have far outdistanced the light\r\nfrom its explosion. It now looks as it did two years ago. 

It_--\r\n\r\n"Pardon me, Commander," Leicher interrupted, "But I have something\r\ninteresting to show you."\r\n\r\nBenedict took his fingers off the keys and turned around in his chair.\r\n"What is it, Doctor?"\r\n\r\nLeicher frowned at the papers in his hands. "I\'ve been doing some work\r\non the probability of that explosion happening just as it did, and I\'ve\r\ncome up with some rather frightening figures. As I said before, the\r\nprobability was small. A little calculation has given us some\r\ninformation which makes it even smaller. For instance: with a possible\r\nerror of plus or minus two seconds Alpha Centauri A began to explode\r\nthe instant we came out of ultradrive!\r\n\r\n"Now, the probability of that occurring comes out so small that it\r\nshould happen only once in ten to the four hundred sixty-seventh\r\nseconds."\r\n\r\nIt was Commander Benedict\'s turn to frown. 

"So?"\r\n\r\n"Commander, the entire universe is only about ten to the seventeenth\r\nseconds old. But to give you an idea, let\'s say that the chances of its\r\nhappening are _once_ in millions of trillions of years!"\r\n\r\nBenedict blinked. The number, he realized, was totally beyond his\r\ncomprehension--or anyone else\'s.\r\n\r\n"Well, so what? Now it has happened that one time. 

That simply means\r\nthat it will almost certainly never happen again!"\r\n\r\n"True. But, Commander, when you buck odds like that and win, the thing\r\nto do is look for some factor that is cheating in your favor. If you\r\ntook a pair of dice and started throwing sevens, one right after\r\nanother--_for the next couple of thousand years_--you\'d begin to\r\nsuspect they were loaded."\r\n\r\nBenedict said nothing; he just waited expectantly.\r\n\r\n"There is only one thing that could have done it. 

Our ship." Leicher\r\nsaid it quietly, without emphasis.\r\n\r\n"What we know about the hyperspace, or superspace, or whatever it is we\r\nmove through in ultradrive is almost nothing. Coming out of it so near\r\nto a star might set up some sort of shock wave in normal space which\r\nwould completely disrupt that star\'s internal balance, resulting in the\r\nliberation of unimaginably vast amounts of energy, causing that star to\r\ngo nova. We can only assume that we ourselves were the fuze that set\r\noff that nova."\r\n\r\nBenedict stood up slowly. When he spoke, his voice was a choking\r\nwhisper. "You mean the sun--Sol--might...."\r\n\r\nLeicher nodded. "I don\'t say that it definitely would. But the\r\nprobability is that we were the cause of the destruction of Alpha\r\nCentauri A, and therefore might cause the destruction of Sol in the\r\nsame way."\r\n\r\nBenedict\'s voice was steady again. "That means that we can\'t go back\r\nagain, doesn\'t it? Even if we\'re not positive, we can\'t take the\r\nchance."\r\n\r\n"Not necessarily. We can get fairly close before we cut out the drive,\r\nand come in the rest of the way at sub-light speed. It\'ll take longer,\r\nand we\'ll have to go on half or one-third rations, but we _can_ do it!"\r\n\r\n"How far away?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what the minimum distance is, but I do know how we can\r\ngage a distance. Remember, neither Alpha Centauri B or C were\r\ndetonated. We\'ll have to cut our drive at least as far away from Sol\r\nas they are from A."\r\n\r\n"I see." The commander was silent for a moment, then: "Very well, Dr.\r\nLeicher. If that\'s the safest way, that\'s the only way."\r\n\r\nBenedict issued the orders, while Leicher figured the exact point at\r\nwhich they must cut out the drive, and how long the trip would take.\r\nThe rations would have to be cut down accordingly.\r\n\r\nCommander Benedict\'s mind whirled around the monstrousness of the whole\r\nthing like some dizzy bee around a flower. What if there had been\r\nplanets around Centauri A? What if they had been inhabited? Had he, all\r\nunwittingly, killed entire races of living, intelligent beings?\r\n\r\nBut, how could he have known? The drive had never been tested before.\r\nIt couldn\'t be tested inside the Solar System--it was too fast. He and\r\nhis crew had been volunteers, knowing that they might die when the\r\ndrive went on.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, Benedict gasped and slammed his fist down on the desk before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nLeicher looked up. "What\'s the matter, Commander?"\r\n\r\n"Suppose," came the answer, "Just suppose, that we have the same\r\neffect on a star when we _go into_ ultradrive as we do when we come\r\nout of it?"\r\n\r\nLeicher was silent for a moment, stunned by the possibility. 

There was\r\nnothing to say, anyway. They could only wait....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA little more than half a light year from Sol, when the ship reached\r\nthe point where its occupants could see the light that had left their\r\nhome sun more than seven months before, they watched it become\r\nsuddenly, horribly brighter. _A hundred thousand times brighter!_\r\n\r\n...

You know the one. Phil\r\nHarris singing about a thing that you couldn\'t get rid of, no matter\r\nwhat you did, a thing so repulsive it made you a social outcast. Never\r\nthought I\'d see one, though. Dirty Pete found it.\r\n\r\nDon\'t rush me. I\'ll tell you about it.\r\n\r\nWe\'re hobos, understand? Now a hobo is a different breed of cat than\r\nyou think. Oh, people are getting educated to the idea that a hobo will\r\nwork and move on, whereas a tramp will mooch and move on, and a bum will\r\nmooch and hang around, but you still find folks who are ignorant enough\r\nto call us bums.\r\n\r\nWe\'re aristocrats, yes sir. If it wasn\'t for us, you wouldn\'t enjoy half\r\nthe little luxuries you do. Oh, don\'t believe me--talk to your experts.\r\nThey know that, without the migratory worker, most of the crops wouldn\'t\r\nget harvested. And, if I talk highfalutin\' once in a while, don\'t blame\r\nme. Associating with the Professor improves any man\'s vocabulary, in\r\nspite of themselves.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was the four of us, see? We\'d been kicking around together for\r\nlonger than I care to think about. There was the Professor and Dirty\r\nPete and Sacks and Eddie. I\'m Eddie. Nicknames are funny things. Take\r\nthe Professor--he was a real professor once, until he began hitting the\r\nbottle. Well, he lost his job, his home, his family, and his rep.\r\n\r\nOne morning, he wakes up on Skid Row without a nickel in his jeans and\r\nthe great-granddaddy of all hangovers. He comes to a decision. Either he\r\ncould make a man out of hisself, or he could die. Right then, dying\r\nlooked like the easiest thing to do, but it took more guts that he had\r\nto jump off a bridge, so he went on the Road instead.\r\n\r\nAfter he got over his shakes--and he sure had \'em bad--he decided that,\r\nif he never took another drink, it\'d be the best thing for him. So he\r\ndidn\'t. 

He had a kind of dignity, though, and he could really talk, so\r\nhe and I teamed up during the wheat harvest in South Dakota. We made all\r\nthe stops and, when we hit the peaches in California we picked up Sacks\r\nand Dirty Pete.\r\n\r\nSacks got his monicker because he never wore shoes. He claimed that\r\ngunny-sacks, wrapped around his feet and shins, gave as much protection\r\nand more freedom, and they were more comfortable, besides costing nix.\r\nSince we mostly bought our shoes at the dumps, at four bits a pair, you\r\nmight say he was stretching a point, but that\'s one of the laws of the\r\nRoad. You don\'t step on the other guy\'s corns, and he don\'t step on\r\nyours.\r\n\r\nSo guess why Dirty Pete was called that. Yeah. He hadn\'t taken a bath\r\nsince \'forty-six, when he got out of the army, and he didn\'t figure on\r\never takin\' another. He was a damn\' good worker, though, and nobody\'d\r\never try anything with him around. He wasn\'t any bigger than a Mack\r\ntruck. Besides, he was quiet.\r\n\r\nOh, sure. You wanna know why I\'m on the Road. 

Well, it happens I like\r\nwhiskers. Trouble is, they\'re not fashionable, unless you\'re some kind\r\nof an artist, which I\'m not. You know, social disapproval. 

I didn\'t have\r\nthe guts to face it, so I lit out. Nobody cares on the Road what you do,\r\nso I was okay with my belt-length beard.\r\n\r\nA beard\'s an enjoyable thing, too. There\'s a certain kind of thrill you\r\nget from stroking it, and feeling its silkiness run through your\r\nfingers. And besides, combing it, and keeping it free of burrs, snarls\r\nand tangles, sort of keeps your spare moments so full that the devil\r\ndon\'t find any idle time to put your hands to work in. If you ask me, I\r\nthink that the razor has been the downfall of society. And I\'m willing\r\nto bet I have plenty of company with the same opinion.\r\n\r\nShow me a man who doesn\'t let his beard grow once in a while, even if\r\nit\'s only for a day or so, and you\'ve shown me a man who thinks more of\r\nsocial pressure than he does of his own comfort. And show me a man who\r\nsays he likes to shave, and you\'ve shown me a man who is either a liar\r\nor is asking for punishment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat\'s enough about us. Now to get on with the story. You know, if the\r\nProfessor hadn\'t been around, there would probably have been murder done\r\nover the Thing, or at least our little group would\'ve split up, \'cause\r\nnone of us had the brains to figure it out.\r\n\r\nPete\'s an expert scrounger. His eyes are sharp, and he\'s always on the\r\nlookout for a salable piece of goods, even if he can only get a nickel\r\nfor it. One night, we\'re sitting in a jungle near Sacramento, trying to\r\nfigure out whether to go north for the grapes, or south for the grapes.\r\nThey\'re all over California, you know, and they pay pretty well.\r\n\r\nPete, as usual, is out looking, and pretty soon he comes back into camp\r\nwith this thing in his hand. He handles it like it was hot, but he\'s\r\npleased he\'s found it, because he hopes to merchandise it. So he walks\r\nup to me, and says, "Hey, Eddie. What\'ll you gimme for this, huh?"\r\n\r\nI say, "Get that to hell away from me! I\'ll give you a swift kick in the\r\npants if you don\'t."\r\n\r\nHe looks real surprised. He says, "Huh, I thought maybe you could use\r\nit."\r\n\r\nI get up on my feet. I say, real low and careful, because maybe he\'s\r\njoking, "Look, Pete--you oughtta know by this time, I _like_ my beard.\r\nNow will you go away?"\r\n\r\nHe mooches off, looking like I\'d kicked him, and goes over to the\r\nProfessor. I figure maybe the Professor could use it, so I listen. The\r\nProf looks like he was being offered a live rattlesnake.\r\n\r\n"No, thanks, really, Pete. I have resolved never to touch it again. 

I\r\nhope you don\'t mind."\r\n\r\nWell, for some reason Pete don\'t look pleased, and he\'s real unhappy by\r\nthis time, but he tries again.\r\n\r\n"Hey, Sacks, what\'ll you gimme for--"\r\n\r\nHe don\'t get a chance to finish. I\'m only listening with half an ear,\r\nbut I\'m so surprised I stand up like I been stuck with a pin. Sacks\r\nsays, "Whatinell would I do with a left shoe? You know I don\'t use \'em."\r\n\r\nPete looks at the thing in his hand, and the Prof and I go over there.\r\n\r\nThe Professor looks at the thing real carefully and speaks up. "Say,\r\nPete, look at that thing and tell me what it is."\r\n\r\n"Why, it\'s a brand new bar of soap, of course. I don\'t use it, but one\r\nof you might want to. What\'s all the beef about?"\r\n\r\n"Soap?" 

I say. "Why, you poor fish, something must have happened to your\r\neyes. When you offered me that straight razor, I thought you\'d gone off\r\nyour nut. Now I _know_ it."\r\n\r\nThe Professor interrupts. He looks excited. 

"Wait a minute, Eddie. To me\r\nthat item looks exactly like a full fifth of Old Harvester, 100 proof.\r\nUsed to be my favorite, before I became an abstainer. To Pete, it looks\r\nlike soap. To you, it looks like a straight razor while, to Sacks, it\r\nresembles a shoe. Does that give you any ideas?"\r\n\r\n"Means we\'re all having hallucinations," I grunts.\r\n\r\n"Exactly. Pete, was there anything else in the location where you found\r\nthis thing?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing but some scrap tin."\r\n\r\n"Show us."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo, the four of us wanders across the field and, sure enough, there was\r\nthis silly-looking object lying there. It was about eighteen or twenty\r\nfeet across, and two feet thick, and I nearly made a fool of myself. I\r\nalmost screamed when I saw six straight razors _crawling_ out of a hole\r\nin its side.\r\n\r\nThe Professor whistled. "Grab them, boys. 

We want them."\r\n\r\nWell, Sacks sacrifices one of his sacks, and we rounded up fifteen of\r\nthe useless things. We went back to the jungle, where the Prof explained\r\nit.\r\n\r\n"Look, fellows, suppose you were a being from another planet that wanted\r\nto take over here. Suppose, further, that you were rather small and\r\nrelatively defenseless. To finish the suppositions, suppose you were a\r\npositive telepath, with not only the ability to read minds, but also the\r\nability to create visual and tactile hallucinations. How would you\r\nprotect yourself?"\r\n\r\nA light began to dawn, but I didn\'t say a word about it.\r\n\r\nThe Professor continued. "If you could do all this, you\'d make yourself\r\nlook just as useless as possible. 

To Pete, you\'d look like a bar of\r\nsoap, because he never uses the stuff. To Sacks, you\'d look like a shoe,\r\nbecause his dislike for shoes is evident in his mind. To Eddie, who is\r\nproud of his beard, you\'d look like a razor, while to me, you\'d look\r\nlike a bottle of booze, because I dislike its effects intensely. In\r\nother words, you would assume an imposture that would assure you\'d never\r\nbe picked up, except by someone like Pete, who would see in you a\r\nsalable item, even though not a usable one. It may be, Pete, that you\r\nhave saved the world."\r\n\r\nSo, that\'s the story. We\'re all still on the Road, of course, but now we\r\nare the "Commission for the Investigation of Extraterrestrial Invasion."\r\nCongress named us as that, when we got the data to them.\r\n\r\nNow, Mr. Mayor, you see our problem. 

Have your citizens seen anything\r\naround that they don\'t want? If they have, we want to look at it.\r\n\r\n                                               --EDWARD G.

He tried to burrow deeper into the\r\nprotectively warm, cave-like place where he\'d been safe from them for\r\nso long. But he couldn\'t escape them. Their hands, their big, red,\r\nhideously smooth hands had him, now. They were tugging and pulling at\r\nhim with a strength impossible to fight. Still he struggled.\r\n\r\nHe tried to cry out but there was no sound from his constricted\r\nthroat. There were only the frightening noises from outside, louder,\r\nnow. He tried to twist and squirm against the hands dragging him\r\ntoward that harsh, blinding light. He was too small, too weak,\r\ncompared to them. He couldn\'t fight them off. He felt himself being\r\nstretched and strained and forced with cruel determination. He didn\'t\r\nwant to go _out there_. 

He knew what was waiting for him _out there_.\r\nHe _couldn\'t_ go. Not _out there_, where....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Jeff McKinney was three years old he tipped a pot of scalding\r\nwater from the stove onto himself. He was badly burned and scarred. He\r\nhovered between life and death for several weeks. Jeff\'s father was\r\nout of work at the time and they were living in a cold water tenement.\r\nSomething about the case caught a tabloid\'s attention and it was\r\nplayed up as a human interest sob story. It came to the attention of a\r\nwealthy man who volunteered to pay for plastic surgery. Then followed,\r\nlong months of that kind of torture, but Jeff McKinney came out of it\r\nnot too badly scarred. Not on the surface, anyhow. 

But his face had a\r\nstrange hue. There was a frozen, mask-like cast to his features when\r\nhe smiled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHe was eight when he saw his father killed. He was in the taxi the\r\nolder McKinney now drove for a living when the father stepped out of\r\nthe driver\'s side onto a busy street without looking back first. The\r\nspeeding truck took the car door and Jeff\'s father with it for half a\r\nblock, wedged between front wheel and fender. Jeff never forgot the\r\nsound of that, and the screaming. Nor his shock when he suddenly\r\nrealized that the screams were his own.\r\n\r\nJeff was a strange boy. He didn\'t have an average childhood. The\r\npoverty was more extreme after his father\'s death. He stayed home\r\nalone while his mother was out working at whatever job she could get,\r\nreading too much and thinking too much. Once, he looked at her with\r\nhaunted eyes and said: "Mother, why is life so bad? Why are people\r\neven born into a world like this?"\r\n\r\nWhat could she say to a question like that? She said: "Please,\r\nJefferson! Please don\'t talk that way. Life isn\'t all bad. You\'ll see.\r\nSome day, in spite of everything, you\'ll be somebody and you\'ll be\r\nhappy. The good times will come."\r\n\r\nThey did, of course. 

A few of them. There was the day he went upstate\r\non an outing for underprivileged boys and went fishing for the first\r\ntime. He caught a whopping trout and won a prize for it. That was\r\nnice; that was fun. That was when he was thirteen. That was the year\r\nthe gang of kids caught him on the way home from school and beat him\r\nunconscious because he never laughed; because they couldn\'t _make_ him\r\nlaugh. The year before his mother died.\r\n\r\nAt the orphanage he didn\'t mingle much with the other boys. He spent\r\nmost of his after-classes hours alone in the school\'s chemistry lab.\r\nHe liked to tinker with chemicals. They were cold, emotionless, immune\r\nto joy and sadness, yet they had purpose. He played the cello, too,\r\nwith haunting beauty, but not in the school band, only when he wanted\r\nto, when nobody was around and he could really feel the music.\r\n\r\nOnce, on the way home from his cello lesson in the music building, he\r\nsaw some boys playing football on the orphanage athletic field. He was\r\nsuddenly seized with a fierce determination to belong, to grab at some\r\nof the shouting, laughing happiness these boys seemed to have. He told\r\nthem he wanted to join in and play, too. He didn\'t understand why they\r\nlaughed so at this idea.\r\n\r\nThey stopped laughing, though, after the first time he ran with the\r\nball, and they all piled up on him and he didn\'t get up. He lay there,\r\nlooking so ghostly and breathing so harshly and with the trickle of\r\nblood coming out of his ears. But Jeff didn\'t know they had stopped\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\nHe recovered from that skull fracture, all right. Worse, though, than\r\nany of the unhappiness he suffered during his life, worse even than\r\nthe shocks of his father\'s and mother\'s deaths, was the thing that\r\nhappened to him when he was twenty and working at the laboratories of\r\na big drug company.\r\n\r\nHe met and fell hopelessly in love with a girl named Nina, a girl a\r\nfew years older than he was. They married and for the first few weeks\r\nJeff McKinney had happiness he\'d never known before. Until he came\r\nhome from work sick, one afternoon and saw Nina with the man from the\r\napartment over them. She didn\'t whine and beg for forgiveness, Nina\r\ndidn\'t. She stood boldly while the other man laughed and laughed and\r\nshe screamed invective upon Jefferson McKinney, telling him what she\r\nreally thought of him, a gloomy, puny weakling who couldn\'t even make\r\na decent living, telling him that she was through with him.\r\n\r\nA blank spot came into Jeff\'s life right then. When it was over, Nina\r\nand the other man were on the floor and there was blood on the kitchen\r\ncarving knife in Jeff\'s hand.\r\n\r\nThey didn\'t find him for awhile. He changed his name and appearance\r\nand hid in the soiled seams and ragged fringes of society. He learned\r\nthe anaesthetic powers of drugs and alcohol. He gave up trying to get\r\nanything out of this life. Then they finally picked him up, fished him\r\nfrom the river into which he\'d jumped. There were days of torture\r\nafter that, without the alcohol and drugs his wrecked system craved.\r\nRight there was the final hell that could have broken him completely.\r\nBut it didn\'t. It was like the terrible crisis after a long illness.\r\nThings began to get better, to go to the other extreme after that.\r\n\r\nA state psychiatrist brought Jeff\'s case to the attention of a noted\r\ncriminal lawyer. Neither Nina nor her lover had died from their knife\r\nwounds. On the plea of the unwritten law, Jeff McKinney got off with a\r\nsuspended sentence. The lawyer and psychiatrist learned of his\r\ninterest and knowledge and talent for chemistry and got him another\r\njob in the experimental laboratory of a big university.\r\n\r\nLater he married a girl named Elaine, who worked at the lab with him.\r\nThey had two children, and lived in a small comfortable cottage just\r\noff the University campus. For several years, they had all they wanted\r\nof life--comfort, health, happiness. Jeff thought that life could\r\nnever be more wonderful. All of his former, bitter, cynical views fell\r\naway from him. Hadn\'t he, with all odds against him, finally won out\r\nand acquired peace and contentment and a purpose in life? 

What was\r\nwrong with a world in which that could happen?\r\n\r\nThen there was the topper. Jefferson McKinney discovered a new drug\r\nwhich would cure and eventually eliminate a disease that was one of\r\nthe world\'s worst killers, the drug for which thousands of scientists\r\nhad been seeking for years.\r\n\r\nHe was feted and honored, became a national hero. The story of his\r\nlife and his discovery temporarily pushed even the doleful forecasts\r\nof an early Third War, the Big War, off the front pages. And Jeff was\r\nhumbly proud and grateful that he had paid now the debt he owed to a\r\nsociety that could make a final victory, like his, possible.\r\n\r\nIn a zenith of almost holy happiness, he stood one evening on a\r\nlecture platform in a huge auditorium in a great city, before\r\nthousands of worshipping people to make a thank-you speech after being\r\nawarded a world prize for his great scientific discovery.\r\n\r\nBut in the middle of his talk he broke off suddenly. A flash of\r\nblinding brilliance slashed through the windows. 

Horror painted his\r\nface. In a whisper, he cried: "No! 

No! It would make it all so\r\nsenseless!" His eyes looked like the eyes of a man with flaming\r\nsplinters jammed under his fingernails. His face seemed to pucker, and\r\ngrow infantile. Then he screamed: "No! Leave me alone! I _told_ you I\r\ndidn\'t want to come _out here_, to be one of _you_! Damn you, why did\r\nyou bring me _out here_? 

For--for _this_?..."\r\n\r\nThere were the shards of glass from the great auditorium windows,\r\nfloating inward, turning lazily. There were the brick walls crumbling,\r\ntumbling inward, scattering through the air in the same seeming slow\r\nmotion. The dust cloud and the sound, the flat blast-sound, came after\r\nthat, as the entire building--perhaps the world--disintegrated in the\r\neye-searing light....\r\n\r\n\r\n_December 8th, 1952, Two-Thirty A. M._\r\n\r\nThe flat of a rubber-gloved hand striking flesh made a splatting\r\nnoise. A thin, breathless but concentrated crying followed. The doctor\r\nlooked down at his charity clinic patient, the woman under the bright\r\ndelivery room lights.\r\n\r\n"Look at him--fighting like a little demon!" the doctor said. "Seemed\r\nalmost as though he didn\'t want to come out and join us.... What\'s the\r\nmatter, son? This is a bright, new, wonderful world to be born\r\ninto.... What are you going to call the boy, Mrs. McKinney?"\r\n\r\nThe woman under the lights forced a tired smile. "Jeff. 

Jefferson\r\nMcKinney. That\'s going to be his name," she whispered proudly.\r\n\r\nThe baby\'s terrified squalling subsided into fretful, whimpering\r\nresignation.\r\n\r\n\r\n--THE END--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n


]\r\n\r\n\r\nWinant followed the lanky sheriff down the jail corridor past rows of\r\nempty, plank-walled cells and drew a sharp breath of relief when they\r\nfound the last cubicle still tenanted.\r\n\r\n"That\'s Uncle Ivor, all right," Winant said. "Sorry he caused you so\r\nmuch trouble, sheriff, but I\'ll be glad to pay his fine. What\'s the\r\ncharge against him?"\r\n\r\nThe sheriff rubbed a palm across his drooping mustaches and looked\r\ndoubtfully at the old man who sat on the edge of the cell bunk, the\r\nbald dome of his head cradled dejectedly in his hands.\r\n\r\n"You couldn\'t rightly say there _is_ a charge, mister," he admitted.\r\n"Your uncle popped into Ben Stuart\'s Drop Inn restaurant night before\r\nlast with a little black box under his arm, naked as a jaybird and\r\ntalking like a crazy man.\r\n\r\n"\'I\'m a visitor from Mars,\' he says. \'Take me to your president, and\r\nquick!\' Ben thought he was crazy, or drunk, and ran him out with a meat\r\ncleaver, and the old duck went down to the Warner Hotel and pulled the\r\nsame goofy act. Pop Warner called me, and I went down and threw the old\r\ncoot into the cooler. I knew right off that he was cracked, because I\r\neven had to show him how to put on the clothes I brought him. And the\r\nwingding he pitched when I took that black box away from him--wow!

"\r\n\r\nWinant shook his head. 

"Poor Uncle Ivor," he said commiseratingly. "The\r\nlast time he got away from us he thought he was Mahatma Ghandi, and\r\ntried to buy a bus ticket from Cincinnati to New Delhi, India. I found\r\nhim, finally, in Evansville, Indiana. It\'s amazing how he got this far\r\nsouth, but then a mentally-unbalanced person can do surprising things,\r\nsometimes."\r\n\r\nThe sheriff snorted. "Unbalanced, hell," he said. "The old coot\'s\r\ncrazy as a bed-bug. Just got in from Mars, he says, and he wants the\r\npresident of the United States--on the double!"\r\n\r\nHe unlocked the door and Winant went inside.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all right now, Uncle Ivor," he said gently. The old man raised\r\na wrinkled, leathery face and stared at him uncomprehendingly. "Let\'s\r\ngo over to my hotel and get a good meal and a hot bath," Winant urged.\r\n"Then we\'ll go home again. 

Ready, now?"\r\n\r\nA few minutes later in the jail office the sheriff pocketed the bill\r\nWinant gave him and handed over a small lacquered metal box that was\r\nsurprisingly heavy for its size.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s your uncle\'s radio," he said. "New-fangled model, I reckon. I\r\ncouldn\'t make head nor tail of it, so I just left it alone."\r\n\r\nWinant lifted the hinged cover and looked inside the box at the neat\r\narray of tiny meters and knobs that covered the control panel.\r\n\r\n"A wise decision, sheriff," he said dryly. "Wiser, perhaps, than you\'ll\r\never know."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe old man stood in the center of Winant\'s hotel room, the sheriff\'s\r\nill-fitting denims hanging on his slight frame like the castoff\r\nclothing of a scare-crow.\r\n\r\n"The box," he said. His voice, after talking for so long, was a hoarse,\r\nrasping croak. "Give me the box."\r\n\r\nWinant sat in a decrepit wicker chair, holding the box in his lap, his\r\neyes missing no detail of the old man\'s shrunken figure with its bald\r\ndome-like head and wrinkled parchment face.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll give you the box when you tell me something that makes sense," he\r\nsaid. "What you\'ve just told me is nothing but a rehash of the story\r\nyou told the sheriff--that your name is Yardana and that you are an\r\nenvoy from Mars, sent to Earth to help scientific authorities develop\r\nsafe atomic power. Look--I\'m a news writer, down here to investigate\r\nthe rumors of a blue meteorite landing in the hills just north of here\r\nand to check up on the comic accounts I read of your appearance. I went\r\nto a lot of trouble and some risk to get you out of jail, and I want a\r\nreasonable story for my trouble. 

What about it, now?

"\r\n\r\nThe old man wrung his hands. "Give me the box. Give me the box!"\r\n\r\n"Later," Winant promised. "When you give me the real story behind this\r\nthing I\'ll not only give you back your box, I\'ll give you a lift out of\r\nthis burg as well."\r\n\r\nHe looked at the old man sharply. "How could a Martian speak the kind\r\nof English you\'ve been using? Why should a Martian look so much like an\r\nordinary human being? It doesn\'t add up."\r\n\r\n"We are of the same root stock," Yardana said. "Intelligent life\r\nfollows the same evolutionary pattern, no matter where it develops, so\r\nlong as conditions are the same. As for the language, my people have\r\nfollowed your experiments with electro-magnetics since their beginning.\r\nWe know every language of Earth intimately, through long study of your\r\nradio programs."\r\n\r\nWinant laughed. 

"Maybe the sheriff was right, at that," he said. 

"It\'s\r\na goofy story, too fantastic for belief."\r\n\r\nHe shrugged and handed the old man the black box.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s your toy," he said resignedly. "I guess that\'s all I\'m\r\ngoing to get for my trouble; just enough misinformation for another\r\ntongue-in-cheek article for Sunday supplements."\r\n\r\nHe picked up his brief-case from the floor and laid it on the corner of\r\nthe writing table at his elbow. "The lift I promised you still goes, if\r\nyou want it, but it\'ll have to wait until tomorrow."\r\n\r\nThe old man took the black box eagerly and threw back the cover. His\r\nfingers flickered over the controls with practised familiarity.\r\n\r\n"I shall not need your assistance--now," he said. 

His pale eyes met\r\nWinant\'s triumphantly. "Now that I have the Bubble again I have a means\r\nof return to my ship better than any Earthly conveyance could offer.\r\nWatch!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom the black box swelled a pulsing radiance, a misty rose-tinted\r\nsphere that grew swiftly until it enveloped Yardana in a six-foot\r\nbubble of iridescent light. Through its wavering envelope the old\r\nman\'s face showed taut and purposeful, its pleading replaced by grim\r\ndetermination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From the black box swelled a pulsing bubble of\r\niridescent light._]\r\n\r\n"Print your story," he said. "Tell your people about Yardana and his\r\nmission. Tell them too that their days are numbered from this minute,\r\nfor in their savage perversion of natural principles to warlike uses\r\nthey have forged a menace that threatens the peace of the Solar System\r\nand, eventually, of the universe itself."\r\n\r\nHe moved toward the window, the rosy Bubble glowing about him. Winant\r\nturned his chair slightly, watching, but he did not rise.\r\n\r\n"My people knew the secrets of the atom," Yardana said, "before your\r\nown learned the use of fire. We built great cities and telescopes\r\nwhen your ancestors were troglodytes, living in caves and eating\r\nuncooked meat. We expected no dangerous intelligence to arise on your\r\nplanet for thousands of years as yet, and we paid little attention\r\nto your progress until recently, when we learned through your radio\r\nbroadcasts that you had cracked the atom. We knew then that something\r\nwas dangerously wrong, and that we must investigate quickly before your\r\nsudden wisdom put you upon equal footing with us.\r\n\r\n"Today, when you should be only learning to compound gunpowder, we\r\nfind you applying electromagnetic principles which you cannot possibly\r\nunderstand, and harnessing the atom for the sole purpose of killing\r\ngreater numbers of your fellow beings. I came here, not to aid your\r\nscientists in developing the rudiments of the atomic power they\r\nhave discovered, but to find the reason behind the sudden freakish\r\nintelligence they are displaying. I have discovered that reason--the\r\nscientific and political powers of Earth are under the domination and\r\nguidance of alien intelligences, entities bent upon developing a race\r\nof Earthmen so warlike and so technically proficient in the waging of\r\nwar that it must endanger our own Martian culture."\r\n\r\nWinant sat unmoving, his eyes not leaving the Martian\'s wrinkled face.\r\nThe Bubble hissed audibly, its tiny sussuration suddenly loud in the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n"Therefore I shall recommend in my report that the human race be\r\ncompletely destroyed," Yardana said. "Alone it could not offer\r\na serious threat against us for ages, but led and instructed by\r\nthese outside intelligences it must soon surpass our own scientific\r\ndevelopment. And we must destroy you before you learn the secret of\r\nspace travel, or we shall be too late to save ourselves.\r\n\r\n"We fought with the peoples of Venus once in ages past for the same\r\nreason, and reduced them to inconsequence if not to extinction, for no\r\nsign of intelligent life has been detected upon their world since we\r\nblasted it three thousand years ago. When I have made my report the\r\ncouncil of Elders will recommend the blasting of Earth, and the solar\r\nsystem will be safe again for our superior Martian civilization--this\r\ntime forever."\r\n\r\n"When you have made your report," Winant said. His smile was edged with\r\na sudden secret amusement. "But suppose these \'alien entities\' prevent\r\nyour return?"\r\n\r\nHe opened the brief-case on the table and put a hand inside it. The\r\nMartian laughed harshly.\r\n\r\n"No missile can penetrate a Bubble, you fool," he said contemptuously.\r\n"It is impervious to any Earthly weapon."\r\n\r\nWinant laughed in turn, his lips pressed back flat against his teeth.\r\nThe repressed hatred of three thousand years spoke in his voice, added\r\npressure to the thrust of his thumb on the stud of the little silver\r\ntube in his hand.\r\n\r\n"Of course it is," he said, as the sullen crimson ray from the tube\r\ndisintegrated Martian, box and Bubble alike in a breath. "That\'s why I\r\ncame prepared--with a Venusian weapon!"\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             As pretty as a picture? Yes, because that was\r\n               all she was ... or would become some day!\r\n\r\n\r\nMy brother, Perry, always was a bit cracked. As a kid, he almost blew\r\nup our house doing experiments. When he was eighteen, he wrote poetry,\r\nbut fortunately that didn\'t last long and he went back to science.\r\n\r\nNow, when he showed me this picture, I figured he\'d had a relapse of\r\nsome kind. "This is the girl I\'m in love with," he said.\r\n\r\nShe wasn\'t bad. Not bad at all, even if her clothes were crazy. She\r\nwasn\'t my type--too brainy-looking--although I could see how some guys\r\nwould go for her. "I thought you liked blondes."\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t give you two cents for all the blondes in Hollywood," he\r\nanswered. "This is the only girl for me."\r\n\r\n"You sound as if you\'ve got it bad," I said. "You going to marry her?"\r\n\r\nHis face dropped about a mile. "I can\'t."\r\n\r\n"You mean she\'s married already?" I was surprised. This wasn\'t like\r\nPerry at all.\r\n\r\nHe sort of hesitated, as if he was afraid of saying too much. "No,\r\nshe isn\'t married. I asked her about that. But I can\'t marry her\r\nbecause--well, I\'ve never met her. All I\'ve seen of her is this\r\npicture and a few more. She doesn\'t live here."\r\n\r\n"You mean she\'s in Europe?" I\'ve heard of these love affairs by mail,\r\nand they never made much sense to me. I said to Perry, "Why can\'t she\r\ncome to this country?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, there are a lot of things in the way."\r\n\r\nIt sounded worse and worse. I said, "Look, Perry, this smells like a\r\nracket to me. It\'s the kind of thing a couple of shrewd operators cook\r\nup to take some hick for a ride. I\'m surprised at you falling for it.\r\nHow do you know there really is a dame like that in Europe? Anybody can\r\nsend pictures----"\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got it all wrong," he said. 

"I\'ve spoken to her."\r\n\r\n"By phone? How do you know who\'s on the other end? You hear a dame\'s\r\nvoice you never heard before. 

What makes you think it\'s hers?"\r\n\r\nAgain he didn\'t seem to want to talk, as if he had some secret to hide.\r\nBut I guess he felt like getting things off his chest, too, or he\r\nwouldn\'t have opened up in the first place. And he had already told me\r\nenough so that if he didn\'t tell me more he\'d sound like a dope.\r\n\r\nSo after hesitating even longer than before, he said, "Let\'s get this\r\nstraight, George. This is no racket. 

I\'ve seen and talked to her at\r\nthe same time. And the things she talked about, no con man would know."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve seen and talked to her at the same time? You mean by TV? 

I\r\ndon\'t believe it. They can\'t send TV to Europe."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t say it was TV. And I didn\'t say she lived in Europe."\r\n\r\n"That\'s exactly what you did say. Or maybe you meant she lived on Mars?"\r\n\r\n"No. She\'s an American."\r\n\r\n"This makes less and less sense to me. 

Where did you meet her?"\r\n\r\nHe turned red, and squirmed all over the place. Finally he said, "Right\r\nhere in my own laboratory."\r\n\r\n"In your own laboratory! But you said you never met her in the flesh!"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t. Not really by TV either. The fact is--she isn\'t born yet."\r\n\r\nI backed away from him. 

When he was a kid and blew up our kitchen, I\r\ndidn\'t like it. When he wrote poetry, I was kind of ashamed and didn\'t\r\nwant my pals to know he was my brother. Now, I was really scared.\r\nEverything he had been saying in the last ten minutes began to make\r\nsense, but a screwy kind of sense.\r\n\r\nHe saw how I felt. 

"Don\'t worry, George, I haven\'t gone crazy. Her time\r\nis 2973, more than a thousand years from now. The only way I\'ve seen\r\nand talked to her is on a time-contact machine."\r\n\r\n"Come again?"\r\n\r\n"A kind of time machine. It can\'t send material objects back and\r\nforth across time, as far as I know, but it can send certain waves,\r\nespecially the kind we use to transmit signals. That\'s how she and I\r\ncould talk to each other and see each other."\r\n\r\n"Perry, I think you ought to see a good doctor."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a remarkable device," he said, paying no attention to how I\r\nwas trying to help him. "She\'s the one who first constructed it and\r\ncontacted me. It\'s based on an extension of Einstein\'s equations----"\r\n\r\n"You think you can explain so much," I said. "Okay, then, explain this.\r\nThis dame isn\'t going to be born for a thousand years. And yet you\r\ntell me you\'re in love with her. What\'s the difference between you and\r\nsomebody that\'s nuts?" I asked, as if anybody knew the answer.\r\n\r\nHe certainly didn\'t. 

In fact, he went ahead and proved to me that they\r\nwere the same thing. Because for the next couple of weeks, the only\r\nthing he\'d talk about, outside of equations I couldn\'t understand,\r\nwas this dame. How smart she was, and how beautiful she was, and how\r\nwonderful she was in every way that a dame can be wonderful, and how\r\nshe loved him. For a time he had me convinced that she actually existed.\r\n\r\n"Compared with you," I said, "Romeo had a mild case."\r\n\r\n"There are some quantities so great that you can\'t measure them," he\r\nsaid. "That will give you some idea of our love for each other."\r\n\r\nThere it went, the old poetry, cropping out in him just like before.\r\nAnd all the time I\'d been thinking it was like measles, something that\r\nyou get once and it builds up your resistance so you don\'t get it\r\nagain, at least not bad. It just goes to show how wrong I could be.\r\n\r\n"What preacher are you going to get to marry you?" I asked. "A guy born\r\nfive hundred years from now?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think that\'s funny," he said.\r\n\r\n"You\'re telling me. Look, Perry, you\'re smart enough to know what I\'m\r\nthinking----"\r\n\r\n"You still think I\'m crazy."\r\n\r\n"I got an open mind on the subject. Now, if you won\'t see a\r\ndoctor--then how about letting me take a look at this dame, so I can\r\nconvince myself?"\r\n\r\n"No," he said. "I\'ve considered doing that, and decided against it.\r\nHer voice and image come through for only about five minutes a day,\r\nsometimes less. And those minutes are very precious to us. 

We don\'t\r\nwant any one else present, any one at all."\r\n\r\n"Not even to convince me she actually exists?"\r\n\r\n"You wouldn\'t be convinced anyway," he said very shrewdly. "No matter\r\nwhat I showed you, you\'d still find a reason to call it a fraud."\r\n\r\nHe was right at that. It would take a lot of convincing to make me\r\nbelieve that a babe who wasn\'t going to get born for a thousand years\r\nwas in love with him.\r\n\r\nBy this time, though, I was sure of one thing--there was something\r\nscrewy going on in that laboratory of his. For five minutes a day he\r\nwas watching some dame\'s picture, listening to her voice. If I had an\r\nidea what she was like, I might figure out where to go from there.\r\n\r\nI began keeping an eye on Perry, dropping in at the laboratory to pay\r\nhim visits. There was what looked like a ten-inch TV tube in one corner\r\nof his place, not housed in a cabinet, but lying on the table among\r\ndozens of other tubes and rheostats and meters and other things I\r\ndidn\'t know about. Along the wall that led from this corner was a lot\r\nof stuff which Perry said was high voltage, and warned me not to touch.\r\n\r\nI kept away. I wasn\'t trying to figure out how to get myself killed.\r\nAll I wanted to know was when he saw this girl.\r\n\r\nFinally I managed to pin the time down to between three and four in the\r\nafternoon. For five minutes every day, during that hour, he locked the\r\ndoor and didn\'t answer phone calls. I figured that if I dropped in then\r\nI might get a glimpse of her.\r\n\r\nAnd that\'s what I did.\r\n\r\nAt first, when I knocked on the door, there was no answer. In a minute,\r\nthough, I heard Perry\'s voice, but he wasn\'t talking to me. He was\r\nsaying, "Darling," and he sounded kind of sick, which I figured was\r\ndue to love. Come to think of it, he might have been scared a little.\r\nI heard him say, "Don\'t be afraid," and it was quiet for about fifteen\r\nseconds.\r\n\r\nThen I heard a terrific crash, like lightning striking. The door shook,\r\nand I smelled something sharp, and the first thing I wanted to do was\r\nget out of that place. But I couldn\'t leave my brother in there.\r\n\r\nI put my shoulder to the door and had no trouble at all. The explosion,\r\nor whatever it was, must have weakened the hinges. As the door crashed\r\nin, I looked for Perry.\r\n\r\nThere was no sign of him. But I could see his shoes, on the floor in\r\nfront of that TV tube, where he must have been standing. No feet in\r\nthem, though, just his socks. All the high-voltage stuff was smoking.\r\nThe TV screen was all lit up, and on it I could see a girl\'s face, the\r\nsame girl whose picture Perry had shown me. She was wearing one of\r\nthose funny costumes, and she looked scared. It was a clear picture,\r\nand I could even see the way she gulped.\r\n\r\nThen she broke out into a happy smile and, for about half a second,\r\nbefore the second explosion, I could see Perry on the screen. After\r\nthat second explosion--even though it wasn\'t near as big as the\r\nfirst--that TV set was nothing but a mess of twisted junk, and there\r\nwas no screen left to see anything on.\r\n\r\nPerry liked to have everything just so, and he\'d never think of going\r\nanyplace without his tie being knotted just right, and his socks\r\nmatching, and so on. And here he\'d traveled a thousand years into the\r\nfuture in bare feet. I felt kind of embarrassed for him.\r\n\r\nAnyway, they were engaged, and now they must be married, so I guess she\r\nhad slippers waiting for him. I\'m just sorry I missed the wedding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


"Something to eat while you\'re\r\nwaiting, folks?"\r\n\r\nThe tall, dark girl glanced out at the closed doors of the Repair shop.\r\n\r\n"How long\'s that car going to take?" she asked in a tired voice. "I\r\nwanted to get home tonight."\r\n\r\n"Not long," Sam said. "It didn\'t look like anything complicated."\r\n\r\n"How can you tell?" the man asked, sitting down. "It could take all\r\nnight."\r\n\r\n"Like something to eat while you\'re waiting?" Sam asked.\r\n\r\nThe woman stared at the lunch racks critically.\r\n\r\n"I never like these places to eat in," the woman said, curling her lip.\r\n"You never know how long the food\'s been stored in the robot."\r\n\r\n"Oh, hell, Grace," the man said wearily. 

To Sam he gave an apologetic\r\nshrug. "Just coffee."\r\n\r\n"Well, you don\'t know," the woman insisted. "I mean...." She watched\r\nSam drawing the coffee into a cup. "I used to cook a lot, by hand, till\r\nJack had the autokitchen put in. He never had any stomach trouble till\r\nthen. It\'s getting so everything\'s ... oh, I don\'t know. 

It\'s all out\r\nof reach. You don\'t know what\'s happening any more. 

Like the car."\r\n\r\n"I wish I knew what she\'s talking about half the time," Jack said,\r\nblowing on his coffee. Sam leaned on the counter, looking past the\r\ncouple toward the empty road.\r\n\r\n"I know what the lady means," Sam said, almost to himself. "You get\r\nto thinking ... well, I can remember when people used to drive their\r\nown cars. Themselves. Steering and everything, except on the biggest\r\nhighways. And everything got done with people. People made things, and\r\ncooked food, and grew plants. Everybody was busy all the time. 

It was\r\nbetter then."\r\n\r\nThe man called Jack shrugged. "Sure, sure. Everybody always talks about\r\nthe good old days. But I don\'t see many of \'em going to live in the\r\nwoods. Like Grace--she says she doesn\'t like the autokitchen, but she\r\nuses it."\r\n\r\n"It saves time," Grace said. "I guess I will have coffee, too, mister."\r\n\r\n"It saves time, she says," Jack said. "For what? 

She\'s got too much\r\ntime now."\r\n\r\n"I wonder what it must have been like in the old days, here," Grace\r\nsaid vaguely, staring around the lunchroom. "Everybody running in and\r\nout. All the drivers--trucks, with men in them, the way you read about\r\nit in the historical novels. Men that drove their own cars, in all\r\nkinds of weather ... 

gee."\r\n\r\n"Just like on TV," Sam said, grinning.\r\n\r\n"I hope we get the car out of there pretty soon," Jack said anxiously.\r\nHe glanced out toward the silent garage. "I always wonder what would\r\nhappen if the machinery stuck, or something. How would you ever get\r\nyour car out?"\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t get stuck," Sam said. A peculiar look crossed his face as\r\nhe added, "Not any more."\r\n\r\n"Did it ever?"\r\n\r\nSam shrugged. "Oh, well, you know twenty or thirty years ago all this\r\nautomatic stuff wasn\'t quite so good as it is now. Cars, repair\r\nshops ... things went wrong, sometimes. Like ... like the Traveler."\r\n\r\n"The Traveler?" The woman looked up. "Oh, that\'s just a ghost story.\r\nLike the Flying Dutchman. Isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\nThe lunchroom was completely silent. Sam was no longer paying any\r\nattention to the couple sitting at the counter. He was close to the\r\nbig window, standing stiffly, feet apart, like an admiral on a ship\'s\r\nbridge, his eyes studying the empty horizon. There, where the lines\r\nof the road met with the precision of a drawing-board exercise in\r\nperspective, he thought he saw a fleck of light.\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t when it goes past," Sam said, in a quiet tight voice. He\r\ntalked at the window, his back to the other two, his words meant\r\nmostly for himself.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not its going by. That doesn\'t bother me," he repeated. "It came\r\nby my old place five or six times, I remember. That\'s why I finally\r\nasked to be transferred out here, where it hardly ever goes by. But I\r\ncould have gotten used to it. I mean, you don\'t have to look at it, or\r\nanything. It\'s just another car. Old, sure, but there\'s no difference.\r\nA car goes by, that\'s all. Only...."\r\n\r\n"You mean it\'s real?" the woman asked, in a low voice.\r\n\r\nHer husband\'s eyes were looking out, toward the empty road, following\r\nSam\'s look.\r\n\r\n"The Traveler," he said, without looking at his wife. "Sure, it\'s real.\r\nWhy\'d you think they don\'t make that model of car any more? It\'s real.\r\nI knew somebody who saw it, once."\r\n\r\n"There might even be two or three Travelers," Sam said, watching the\r\ndistant glitter of light. There was certainly a car coming. Just a\r\ncar ... although it was still too far away to tell for sure.\r\n\r\n"A haunted car!" the woman said, her eyes wider. "Gee!"\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t a haunted car," her husband said. "It\'s just one of the\r\nearliest makes of automatic highway cars. Everything automatic,\r\nsteering, destination set ... just like any car is, nowadays. Only it\r\nwasn\'t quite perfect, somehow."\r\n\r\n"They got into their car," Sam said, his eyes picking out distant,\r\nmicroscopic details. The high flaring fins, the double headlamps ...\r\nlit up, although it was broad daylight on the road. He knew what the\r\nrest would be. It was moving so slowly. But it always moved slowly,\r\nbarely thirty miles an hour. As if somebody wanted you to look and\r\nsee....\r\n\r\n"They just got in, the way anybody would do," Sam said. "They set a\r\ndestination, and the windows closed up, and the airconditioner went on,\r\nand the car went out on the road."\r\n\r\n"Only it never got there," the other man said. "Wherever it was going\r\nto go."\r\n\r\n"But ..." the woman looked puzzled. "Wouldn\'t anybody stop it? I mean,\r\nwouldn\'t it run out of fuel, or ... well, how did the people in it get\r\nout?"\r\n\r\n"It does just what any car does," her husband told her. "It gets fuel\r\nwhen it needs it. You can\'t just stop a robot control device. Not till\r\nit\'s good and ready.

"\r\n\r\n"But the people in it," she said. "They\'d starve, or something...."\r\n\r\nThe car called the Traveler, rolling at the stately thirty miles an\r\nhour it always held, was coming down the road now, and the two men\r\nstood, watching. The woman, a little behind them, watched too, her face\r\ngrowing whiter. No one said anything as the old fashioned car rolled\r\nby, straight and steady down the highway, holding the center of the\r\nlane as sharply as it always did.\r\n\r\nThere was a film of dust inside the windows, though the Traveler was\r\nclean and shining outside. But the film did hide the white bone faces,\r\nthe despairing hands that had long ago stopped trying to break through\r\nthose closed windows.\r\n\r\n"They never did get out," the man named Jack said, as the Traveler\r\nrolled on, growing smaller along the endless road.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mind it when it goes past," Sam said, his voice thinner edged.\r\n"I really don\'t. It\'s just a car. 

Things like that used to happen. I\r\nmean, it\'s a car. Even when it stops to get gas, I don\'t have to pay\r\nany attention."\r\n\r\nHe looked at the couple, his mouth loose. "As long as it just goes on.\r\nThat\'s all right. 

But I keep thinking some day it\'ll stop. And the door\r\nwill open. 

And maybe ... maybe they\'ll want lunch."\r\n\r\nHe giggled uncontrollably, and then choked it back.\r\n\r\nOutside, the big hangar doors of the repair shop opened. The car that\r\nhad been inside appeared; it moved out and stopped, its doors open\r\ninvitingly.\r\n\r\n"Your car\'s ready now," Sam told the couple. "So long, folks. 

Have a\r\nnice trip."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt happened so fast that for a minute he just stood there absolutely\r\nincapable of taking it in. One instant the big Earth-Venus rocket\r\nfreighter was sizzling through the fog to a perfect landing on the\r\nfield below. Then suddenly she dipped, undershot the field and vanished\r\nin a flash and a thundering explosion that shook the observation tower.\r\n\r\nIn the dream-like quiet that followed, Dan Kearns heard the faint yells\r\nof the landing crew. He saw the big searchlights switch on, cutting\r\nwide swaths of light through the boiling fog. Tiny white-coated medics\r\ncrossed the patches of light, running frantically. Dan sat down in the\r\nchair feeling sick and very tired. Then the door of the tower room\r\nopened and Rawlins, the supervisor, stepped in.\r\n\r\n"All right, Kearns," he said curtly, "you\'re through. And if anyone\r\nasks me about your ability as an electronics engineer, I\'ll write out\r\nthe blackest recommendation I can think of.

"\r\n\r\nDan got up slowly. 

"How many were killed?"\r\n\r\n"Two!" Rawlins glared. "Two of my best pilots!"\r\n\r\nDan\'s shoulders stiffened. "Listen, Rawlins, I\'m just as interested as\r\nyou in breaking Roehm\'s monopoly on Earth-Venus rockets."\r\n\r\n"Get out!"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t get out. Don\'t forget you have another rocket due in twenty\r\nminutes--a passenger rocket."\r\n\r\nRawlins\' face went pale. 

"My God! I\'d forgotten." He threw up his\r\nhands. "Turn \'em back," he shrieked. "Send \'em back to earth! It\'s\r\nsuicide to land on that guide beam."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t send them back to Earth," Dan said quietly. "They haven\'t\r\nenough fuel."\r\n\r\n"Then send \'em to one of Roehm\'s fields. It\'s an admission of complete\r\ndefeat, but we can\'t kill \'em."\r\n\r\nDan swallowed. "You\'re forgetting that Roehm uses invisible light for\r\nlanding--not ultra short waves. Anyway, do you think Roehm would miss\r\nsuch a chance to crash one of our rockets?"\r\n\r\nRawlins sat down with a groan. "Where in thunder did I ever get the\r\nidea we could bring in a ship through that magnetic murk on ultra short\r\nwaves?"\r\n\r\nDan lifted his head. "There\'s nothing the matter with my guide beam. It\r\nbrought in the experimental rocket yesterday and magnetic conditions\r\nwere even worse."\r\n\r\n"I see." The smile on Rawlins\' lined face was cynical. "In other words\r\nyou\'re trying to pass the buck to Stevens, your control-room operator."\r\n\r\nThe door of the observation room swung open and a wild-eyed mechanic\r\nburst in.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Rawlins, the control-room is still locked. Stevens is sitting in\r\nfront of the table and he won\'t answer us."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDan tore down the stairs and across the catwalk two steps ahead of\r\nRawlins. He hammered on the door. Through the thick glass he could see\r\nStevens hunched over the lighted control table.\r\n\r\n"Stevens! Stevens!" 

He turned to Rawlins. "We\'ll have to cut the lock.\r\nGet a torch--and get a doctor!"\r\n\r\nIt took a minute with a high torch before they crashed into the room.\r\n\r\n"He\'s been dead several minutes," the doctor said as he took his hand\r\nfrom Steven\'s forehead.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry, Kearns," Rawlins said. He looked at the doctor. 

"Well, I\r\nguess that explains everything. He must have lost control just as she\r\nwas coming in. What was it? Heart attack?"\r\n\r\nThe doctor shook his head. "Some sort of convulsion. Muscles violently\r\ncontracted. Funny he didn\'t fall to the floor. Must have affected the\r\nwhole nervous system. Even the eye pupils are down to pin points." 

He\r\nlooked around at Rawlins. "I may be sticking my neck out, sir, but off\r\nhand I\'d say Stevens was killed."\r\n\r\n"Killed?" Rawlins blinked at the form in the chair. "But that\'s\r\nimpossible. The door was locked. The room hasn\'t been disturbed and\r\nthere aren\'t any holes in the glass. Nothing could get in here except\r\nlight."\r\n\r\nDan walked to the big windows. He examined the ledge and the joints.\r\nHe came back to the control table and tested the switches. Suddenly he\r\nleaned over Stevens\' huddled body and pulled the log book from under\r\nhis stiff fingers.\r\n\r\n"Look at this!"\r\n\r\nScrawled across the pad in big jerky letters were the words "_Purple\r\nlight bea_...." The pencil had torn through the sheet in a violent\r\nfinal contraction.\r\n\r\nRawlins rubbed his chin. "We don\'t use any purple beams. It doesn\'t\r\nmake sense.

"\r\n\r\n"Maybe it does," Dan said. He turned to the doctor. "Wasn\'t there\r\nsome experiments made by a Dr. Aren Linden several years ago on the\r\ninjurious effect of certain kinds of light on the nervous system?"\r\n\r\nThe doctor frowned. "Yes, I think there was, but the experiments were\r\nnever completed."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right. The foundation refused to up his salary, so he went to\r\nwork for Roehm." Dan swung around to Rawlins. "It was Linden who helped\r\nwork out the invisible light landing system that Roehm uses on his\r\nVenus rocket ports."\r\n\r\n"Seems to me you\'re jumping to some pretty wild conclusions, Kearns,"\r\nRawlins said slowly.\r\n\r\nDan looked at him. "Suppose Linden has found the exact wave-length\r\nof the most potent ray. It would be simple for anyone to climb the\r\nframework of one of the buildings and shine that light in here."\r\n\r\nRawlins straightened up. "I\'ll search every tower on the field."\r\n\r\n"But you haven\'t time. That passenger rocket will be here in five\r\nminutes."\r\n\r\nThe supervisor sucked in his breath. 

"What\'s your idea?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll sit at the control table myself. You can do the preliminary\r\nlocating in the observation tower." He ran to the door. "Where\'s the\r\nwelder that cut the lock?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe doctor and a medic were carrying out Stevens when he came back a\r\nfew seconds later. Dan was slipping on the welder\'s helmet.\r\n\r\n"Keep everyone away from the control-room level," he said to Rawlins.\r\n"And you better have the crash trucks and the flame quenchers standing\r\nby on the field."\r\n\r\nRawlins stared at him. 

"And what happens to you?"\r\n\r\nDan licked his lips. "I--I don\'t know. 

I\'m going to try something."\r\n\r\nRawlins smiled. He reached out his hand. "Good luck, Dan," he said. He\r\nclapped him on the shoulder.\r\n\r\nWhen they were gone, Dan dropped the helmet over his face. He walked\r\nslowly across the room with his hands in front of him like a blind man.\r\nFinally he lifted up across the room with his hands in front of the\r\nhelmet and knocked out the dark glass in the eye slot. Then he slipped\r\nit back on. From one of the drawers in a small desk beside the control\r\ntable he lifted out a small rectangular object and slipped it in his\r\npocket. He seated himself before the control table.\r\n\r\nThe dials on the edge of the table glowed dimly. In the center of the\r\nflat top was a large circular graph with white lines that pulsed like\r\na network of capillaries. He looked across the table through the big\r\nwindow. Everything except one nearby tower was hidden in swirling mists.\r\n\r\nThe speaker at his side clicked on. He heard Rawlins\' voice. "I picked\r\n\'em up Dan. They\'re coming in at minimum speed--seventy point two nine\r\nfive degrees. I didn\'t mention the freighter."\r\n\r\nDan flicked a small switch on the table edge. A straight white line\r\nof light shot out across the graph, then swung slowly back and forth\r\nthrough an arc of ten degrees like a searching feeler. Suddenly it\r\nsteadied and an orange bead appeared at its terminus. Dan watched the\r\nbead travel down the line, across the pulsing capillaries. He reached\r\nout and grasped a small lever sticking out of the table top. As he\r\npressed the lever to one side, the line moved around the graph like\r\na pointer, carrying the orange bead with it. He watched it till the\r\nbead reached the center of the graph, and then glanced up through the\r\nwindow. Above the far end of the field he could discern the dim orange\r\nglow of a rocket\'s keel jets.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he jerked back his head. A beam of purple light was playing\r\nback and forth across the table. It swept over his gloved hands, across\r\nhis arms and chest, and moved upward toward his face. He jumped up,\r\nkeeping hold of the lever and studied the angle of the small beam. The\r\nreflection on the dark cloth of his jacket was making him dizzy. He\r\nreached into his pocket....\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Suddenly ... a beam of purple light!_]\r\n\r\nFrom the observation tower Rawlins watched the rocket sweep toward the\r\nfield with keel jets blazing. As it reached the strip it seemed to\r\nfalter and dip. Rawlins clenched his hands and swore. Then it steadied\r\nand slid in to a perfect landing.\r\n\r\nThe intercommunication telaudio flashed on. He saw Dan Kearns\' haggard\r\nface under the uplifted welder\'s helmet.\r\n\r\n"Rawlins. The roof on tower three. Check it right away. I think...."\r\nKearns\' body abruptly went rigid; he fell across the control-room table.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDan Kearns came to on the floor of the control-room with the doctor\r\nworking over him.\r\n\r\n"How do you feel?" the doctor asked.\r\n\r\n"Like I\'ve been sitting in an electric chair."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll be all right," the doctor said. "Compared to Stevens you got a\r\nmild dose."\r\n\r\nDan looked around him. He saw Rawlins\' boots and glanced upward. "Did\r\nyou check the tower?"\r\n\r\n"Yep, we found him--dead. Just like Stevens. He was one of Roehm\'s men\r\nall right. He had a flashlight. We tried it on one of the doc\'s white\r\nrats." Rawlins shook his head. "Stevens must have gone through hell."\r\nSuddenly he stared down at Dan. 

"But how...?"\r\n\r\nDan smiled. 

He lifted up his gloved hand. In it was a small rectangular\r\nsignaling mirror.\r\n\r\n"I reflected it right back at him."\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Have you found out about the Big\r\n                    Engine? It\'s all around us, you\r\n                   know--can\'t you hear it even now?\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are all sorts of screwy theories (the Professor said) of what\r\nmakes the wheels of the world go round. There\'s a boy in Chicago who\r\nthinks we\'re all of us just the thoughts of a green cat; when the green\r\ncat dies we\'ll all puff to nothing like smoke. There\'s a man in the\r\nwest who thinks all women are witches and run the world by conjure\r\nmagic. There\'s a man in the east who believes all rich people belong to\r\na secret society that\'s a lot tighter and tougher than the Mafia and\r\nthat has a monopoly of power-secrets and pleasure-secrets other people\r\ndon\'t dream exist.\r\n\r\nMe, I think the wheels of the world just go. I decided that forty\r\nyears ago and I\'ve never since seen or heard or read anything to make\r\nme change my mind.\r\n\r\nI was a stoker on a lake boat then (the Professor continued, delicately\r\nsipping smoke from his long thin cigarette). 

I was as stupid as they\r\nmake them, but I liked to think. Whenever I\'d get a chance I\'d go to\r\none of the big libraries and make them get me all sorts of books.\r\nThat was how guys started calling me the Professor. I\'d get books on\r\nphilosophy, metaphysics, science, even religion. I\'d read them and try\r\nto figure out the world. 

What was it all about, anyway? Why was I here?\r\nWhat was the point in the whole business of getting born and working\r\nand dying? What was the use of it? Why\'d it have to go on and on?\r\n\r\nAnd why\'d it have to be so complicated?\r\n\r\nWhy all the building and tearing down? Why\'d there have to be cities,\r\nwith crowded streets and horse cars and cable cars and electric cars\r\nand big open-work steel boxes built to the sky to be hung with stone\r\nand wood--my closest friend got killed falling off one of those steel\r\nboxkites. Shouldn\'t there be some simpler way of doing it all? 

Why did\r\nthings have to be so mixed up that a man like myself couldn\'t have a\r\nsingle clear decent thought?\r\n\r\nMore than that, why weren\'t people a real part of the world? Why didn\'t\r\nthey show more honest-to-God response? When you slept with a woman,\r\nwhy was it something you had and she didn\'t? Why, when you went to a\r\nprize fight, were the bruisers only so much meat, and the crowd a lot\r\nof little screaming popinjays? Why was a war nothing but blather and\r\nblowup and bother? Why\'d everybody have to go through their whole lives\r\nso dead, doing everything so methodical and prissy like a Sunday School\r\npicnic or an orphan\'s parade?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd then, when I was reading one of the science books, it came to me.\r\nThe answer was all there, printed out plain to see only nobody saw it.\r\nIt was just this: Nobody was really alive.\r\n\r\nBack of other people\'s foreheads there weren\'t any real thoughts or\r\nminds, or love or fear, to explain things. The whole universe--stars\r\nand men and dirt and worms and atoms, the whole shooting match--was\r\njust one great big engine. 

It didn\'t take mind or life or anything else\r\nto run the engine. It just ran.\r\n\r\nNow one thing about science. It doesn\'t lie. Those men who wrote those\r\nscience books that showed me the answer, they had no more minds than\r\nanybody else. Just darkness in their brains, but because they were\r\nmachines built to use science, they couldn\'t help but get the right\r\nanswers. They were like the electric brains they\'ve got now, but hadn\'t\r\nthen, that give out the right answer when you feed in the question. I\'d\r\nlike to feed in the question, "What\'s Life?" to one of those machines\r\nand see what came out. 

Just figures, I suppose. I read somewhere that\r\nif a billion monkeys had typewriters and kept pecking away at them\r\nthey\'d eventually turn out all the Encyclopedia Brittanica in trillions\r\nand trillions of years. Well, they\'ve done it all right, and in jig\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThey\'re doing it now.\r\n\r\nA lot of philosophy and psychology books I worked through really fit\r\nin beautifully. There was Watson\'s _Behaviorism_ telling how we needn\'t\r\neven assume that people are conscious to explain their actions. There\r\nwas Leibitz\'s _Monadology_, with its theory that we\'re all of us lonely\r\natoms that are completely out of touch and don\'t effect each other in\r\nthe slightest, but only seem to ... because all our little clockwork\r\nmotors were started at the same time in pre-established harmony. We\r\n_seem_ to be responding to each other, but actually we\'re just a bunch\r\nof wooden-minded puppets. Jerk one puppet up into the flies and the\r\nothers go on acting as if exactly nothing at all had happened.\r\n\r\nSo there it was all laid out for me (the Professor went on, carefully\r\npinching out the end of his cigarette). That was why there was no\r\nhonest-to-God response in people. They were machines.\r\n\r\nThe fighters were machines made for fighting. The people that watched\r\nthem were machines for stamping and screaming and swearing. The bankers\r\nhad banking cogs in their bellies, the crooks had crooked cams. A woman\r\nwas just a loving machine, all nicely adjusted to give you a good time\r\n(sometimes!) but the farthest star was nearer to you than the mind\r\nbehind that mouth you kissed.\r\n\r\nSee what I mean? People just machines, set to do a certain job and\r\nthen quietly rust away. If you kept on being the machine you were\r\nsupposed to be, well and good. Then your actions fitted with other\r\npeople\'s. But if you didn\'t, if you started doing something else, then\r\nthe others didn\'t respond. They just went on doing what was called for.\r\n\r\nIt wouldn\'t matter what you did, they\'d just go on making the motions\r\nthey were set to make. They might be set to make love, and you might\r\ndecide you wanted to fight. They\'d go on making love while you fought\r\nthem. Or it might happen the other way--seems to, more often!\r\n\r\nOr somebody might be talking about Edison. And you\'d happen to say\r\nsomething about Ingersoll. But he\'d just go on talking about Edison.\r\n\r\nYou were all alone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nExcept for a few others--not more than one in a hundred thousand, I\r\nguess--who wake up and figure things out. And they mostly go crazy and\r\nrun themselves to death, or else turn mean. 

Mostly they turn mean. They\r\nget a cheap little kick out of pushing things around that can\'t push\r\nback. All over the world you find them--little gangs of three or four,\r\nhalf a dozen--who\'ve waked up, but just to their cheap kicks. Maybe\r\nit\'s a couple of coppers in \'Frisco, a schoolteacher in K.C., some\r\nartists in New York, some rich kids in Florida, some undertakers in\r\nLondon--who\'ve found that all the people walking around are just dead\r\nfolk and to be treated no decenter, who see how bad things are and get\r\ntheir fun out of making it a little worse. Just a mean _little_ bit\r\nworse. They don\'t dare to destroy in a big way, because they know the\r\nmachine feeds them and tends them, and because they\'re always scared\r\nthey\'d be noticed by gangs like themselves and wiped out. They haven\'t\r\nthe guts to really wreck the whole shebang. But they get a kick out of\r\nscribbling their dirty pictures on it, out of meddling and messing with\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI\'ve seen some of their fun, as they call it, sometimes hidden away,\r\nsometimes in the open streets.\r\n\r\nYou\'ve seen a clerk dressing a figure in a store window? Well, suppose\r\nhe slapped its face. Suppose a kid stuck pins in a calico pussy-cat, or\r\nthrew pepper in the eyes of a doll.\r\n\r\nNo decent live man would have anything to do with nickel sadism or dime\r\nparanoia like that. He\'d either go back to his place in the machine and\r\nact out the part set for him, or else he\'d hide away like me and live\r\nas quiet as he could, not stirring things up. Like a mouse in a dynamo\r\nor an ant in an atomics plant.\r\n\r\n(The Professor went to the window and opened it, letting the sour old\r\nsmoke out and the noises of the city in.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nListen (he said), listen to the great mechanical symphony, the big\r\nblack combo. The airplanes are the double bass. Have you noticed how\r\nyou can always hear one nowadays? When one walks out of the sky another\r\nwalks in.\r\n\r\nPresses and pumps round out the bass section. Listen to them rumble\r\nand thump! Tonight they\'ve got an old steam locomotive helping. Maybe\r\nthey\'re giving a benefit show for the old duffer.\r\n\r\nCars and traffic--they\'re the strings. Mostly cellos and violas. They\r\npurr and wail and whine and keep trying to get out of their section.\r\n\r\nBrasses? To me the steel-on-steel of streetcars and El trains always\r\nsounds like trumpets and cornets. Strident, metallic, fiery cold.\r\n\r\nHear that siren way off? It\'s a clarinet. The ship horns are tubas,\r\nthe diesel horn\'s an oboe. And that lovely dreadful french horn is an\r\nelectric saw cutting down the last tree.\r\n\r\nBut what a percussion section they\'ve got! The big stuff, like\r\nstreetcar bells jangling, is easy to catch, but you have to really\r\nlisten to get the subtleties--the buzz of a defective neon sign, the\r\nclick of a stoplight changing.\r\n\r\nSometimes you do get human voices, I\'ll admit, but they\'re not like\r\nthey are in Beethoven\'s _Ninth_ or Holst\'s _Planets_.\r\n\r\n_There\'s_ the real sound of the universe (the Professor concluded,\r\nshutting the window). That\'s your heavenly choir. 

That\'s the music\r\nof the spheres the old alchemists kept listening for--if they\'d just\r\nstayed around a little longer they\'d all have been deafened by it. Oh,\r\nto think that Schopenhauer was bothered by the crack of carters\' whips!\r\n\r\nAnd now it\'s time for this mouse to tuck himself in his nest in the\r\ndynamo. Good night, gentlemen!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe big man with the iron grey hair stared morosely out the quartz\r\nwindow and across the roofs of Greater New York. Far down the canyon\r\nstreets a few motor cars still ran and over the swinging aerial bridges\r\nscattered pedestrians carefully wended their way. Their grotesque\r\nfigures with the heavy metal helmets that reminded the watching man\r\nof the half-mythical sea monsters of the past or divers that used to\r\nexplore wrecks were far different from the jostling crowds that had\r\ncrowded the ways only a few short days ago. But that was before the\r\nplague--the plague of the whispering death.\r\n\r\nJohn Cortland, United Utilities Power magnate, sighed as he turned\r\nfrom the quiet streets below. Somberly he regarded a tiny light beam\r\nthat came from the mirror of a galvanometer that trembled and danced\r\ncontinually. 

He mused over the events of the past few days and wondered\r\nat their meaning. Like a caged tiger he paced the metal lined room\r\nwaiting for the word that would spell success or disaster. Five days\r\nbefore it had first appeared. A whispering, a singing and vibrating had\r\nmanifested itself. It was not local but appeared simultaneously all\r\nover the earth. This whispering, as of elfish voices, was not annoying\r\nat first; but it changed and alternated from a shrill whine back to the\r\neery murmuring that was first noticed. Young Cavendish at the Black\r\nLaboratories had first tracked down the cause of the strange sounds--as\r\nto its ultimate origin, that was still veiled in mystery.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the first day people had become nervous, at the end\r\nof the second many were on the point of breaking, and then mankind\r\nbegan to go insane. It was too much for their nervous systems and the\r\nvibration seemed to affect the inner ear. Suddenly a well ordered\r\nplanet became a center of bedlam and chaos. Order could not be restored\r\nbecause there was no one to handle affairs. 

If Dr. Hankins had not\r\ndiscovered that iron would shield a wearer from the vibrations, mankind\r\nwould have been doomed. As it was only a few of the earth\'s heavy\r\npopulation had been able to get the protecting helmets, and some had\r\nlived in metal lined rooms. This discovery of the shielding effect of\r\niron led to the discovery that an electro-magnetic radiation between\r\ninfra-red and the short radio waves was acting on the ozone molecules\r\nto set them into vibration. To cap it all the ionized Heavyside Layer\r\nthat protected the earth from the ultra-violet rays from the sun\r\nwas decomposing also. Thus to the plague of the Whispering Death was\r\nadded the threat of sun burn--a horrible burn that killed the skin and\r\nultimately the patient.\r\n\r\nSavagely John Cortland kicked at his chair as he paced across the\r\nroom. There was one slender hope, a tiny thread that might save them\r\nat last. Europe was prostrated, Asia in turmoil, and America in chaos.\r\nAll depended on the theory that the origin of the destructive vibration\r\nthat had set their ozone molecules into their dance of death had\r\nintelligence back of it. The source of the radiation could not be found\r\nat this time, but that was not needed. If they could use the incoming\r\nradiation field as a carrier and heterodyne on it a super-imposed\r\nvibration perhaps the source could be destroyed. Japan had furnished\r\nthe formula for the opposing field, and United Utilities Power the\r\nenergy. All the great power stations on the planet had been connected\r\nup into a unit, all the tremendous kilowatts of energy had been flowing\r\nfor hours into those great reservoirs of bound energy, the artificial\r\nspace field invented by Minski of Stalingrad; and the great glass\r\nglobes at Schenectady had taken this power and had built up a voltage\r\nunthinkable. The earth was going to hurl the thunderbolts of Jove.\r\n\r\nFor hours now he had restlessly awaited the signal to release this\r\nenergy in answer to the Whispering Death. For hours the stunned planet\r\nhad awaited the moment of decision. When he would release all this pent\r\nup energy that Niagara, Victoria, and countless other water falls and\r\nmany great steam power plants that had been harnessed for man\'s use,\r\nthe carefully pre-calculated voltage would hurl an electron stream\r\nat a target, the desired wave length would be omitted by the target,\r\nand would automatically heterodyne itself on the invading field. This\r\nfrightful stream of energy would blast its generators into atoms, but\r\nit must suffice. It was earth\'s dying stroke.\r\n\r\nA bell tinkled and eagerly John Cortland rushed to answer. A quiet\r\nvoice said.\r\n\r\n"We are ready. The potential has reached maximum.

"\r\n\r\nThe zero hour had arrived. Nervously John Cortland looked around the\r\nroom, at the familiar articles, and once out the window at the sunlight\r\nand then back in.\r\n\r\nHe threw the switch.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPhor, great leader of the once powerful Murians, gazed through the\r\nmatter shield across space to the planet hanging in the heavens. A\r\ngreat green disk outlined in pearly light with green continents and\r\nbluish-green seas pointed clearly to its nearness. The artificial\r\nsatellite that housed the observatory was circling this planet with\r\nincredible velocity. This was just what they had been looking for, an\r\nhabitable planet with intelligent beings on it to aid them in their\r\nproblems. Long ages ago they had left their planet just before their\r\nsun had become a nova and had exploded. Only a few of their peoples\r\nhad been saved and at the thought the great goggle eyes filmed in\r\nsorrow. The great journey through space had tried them all, generations\r\nhad been born and some had died. 

By necessity they had kept their\r\npopulation down until they could come to a system which might support\r\nthem. They not only needed a habitable planet but an intelligent people\r\non this planet so that they could rebuild their civilization quickly.\r\nThey were friendly and had no wish to harm the dwellers on this planet.\r\n\r\nHe did not entirely agree with the council that they should get into\r\ncommunication with these peoples before landing. Phor thought they\r\nwere wasting time to encircle this beautiful world while attempting\r\nto communicate with them. Their atmosphere analysis had shown them\r\nsmall quantities of ozone and they were bombarding the ozone with\r\na controlled radiation. This caused them to act as receivers and\r\nconverters so that intelligent communication could be set up. It was\r\njust like a radio without a receiving set. The ozone molecules did\r\nit all just before decomposing. To one side he could see the huge\r\ntransformers and generators of the tiny moonlet\'s driving plant and\r\nray generators. The actual projector hung like a huge mushroom some\r\ndistance from the generating plant. The inclined buildings, due to the\r\nhigh radius of curvature of the moonlet, looked as if they were falling\r\ndown all the time. Tiny figures of Murians ceaselessly worked about the\r\ngreat machines that had cared for them for ages.\r\n\r\nFor days now they had been keeping up the barrage, hoping to get a\r\nresponse. Their electro-telescopes had shown them that this planet\r\nhoused a people as intelligent as their own. Their great cities,\r\nships, and power stations made them long to be with the planet\'s\r\npeoples. Together they could do wonders and here they were waiting\r\nin space. 

Why this waste of time? Of course the Council was right in\r\nbelieving that the sudden appearance of unfamiliar beings might start\r\nan interplanetary war, and they could not fight a war. Their resources\r\nwere practically exhausted, their peoples few, and they had no desire\r\nto cause trouble. 

They only wanted peace and a place to live. He\r\nshrugged his scaly shoulders and cocked his vertical eye at the meters\r\ncovering the walls. No response to their messages yet. 

What could be\r\nthe matter? Of course the planet had a denser atmosphere than that they\r\nhad been accustomed to, but no matter. They could adjust themselves to\r\nit. 

Strange about the messages though. They had been exactly within the\r\naudibility range of the Murians and their antennae had no difficulty in\r\nreading them. Of course the planet\'s men would receive them just the\r\nsame. Still the prediction of Tum-tak that the denser atmosphere would\r\nincrease the pitch of the ozone molecules had to be considered. However\r\nthis increased pitch should not harm the inhabitants. Their antennae\r\nreceived them very well tests demonstrated. They had not tested them\r\nfor an effect on an inner ear structure, for they had never possessed\r\nthem. Their sound transmission had been direct.\r\n\r\nIf they did not get a response within a few more revolutions about the\r\nplanet they would be compelled to go down into the atmosphere. Wonder\r\nwhat that unusual activity about the power plants and the great crystal\r\nglobes on one of the major continents meant anyway? Perhaps they were\r\npreparing to answer their calls. But why so much power as they seemed\r\nto be accumulating? What a peculiar field! That was unknown to them.\r\nWhy these peoples had pumped more power into that one field than the\r\nMurians had developed for ages. Great peoples these inhabitants of the\r\nthird planet. Well, he would take one more glance at the great crystal\r\nglobes before turning over his place to his aide. There it was now.\r\nThe crystal globes were surrounded in crimson flame, they disappeared\r\nin blinding incandescence, and horrors, simultaneously their projector\r\nhad been surrounded by a halo of radiation that arced across to the\r\ngenerators. These exploded showering molten metal on the frightened\r\nMurians. Phor did not see the full charge arrive, blasting the moonlet\r\ninto incandescence and destroying the last of the Murians.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "_The generators exploded showering molten metal on the\r\nfrightened Murians._"]\r\n\r\nA great flare came into being in space between earth and moon. The\r\nearthlings were greatly mystified at it, but the Whispering Death had\r\nceased. They were satisfied.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


snapped Rogers. "It\'s bad enough without your moaning!"\r\n\r\nOblivious to the captain\'s words, Lejeune patted his bottle\r\naffectionately.\r\n\r\n"In the name of heaven!" growled Geitz, leaping to his feet. "Why do we\r\nsit here like a lot of mummies? There\'s a rocket capsule aboard, you\r\nsay, with sufficient power to carry one of us to Mercury. Why don\'t we\r\nuse it? I ask you, Rogers."\r\n\r\n"You answered that yourself," the captain said bluntly. "True,\r\nthat rocket capsule can carry one of us to Mercury. Just one,\r\nunderstand--there\'s room for but one person in a capsule. I ask\r\nyou--which one of us would that be?

"\r\n\r\n"That\'s beside the point," muttered Geitz, as he wiped beads of\r\nperspiration from his forehead. "You don\'t seem to realize what\r\nvaluable information we possess. Think of that cylinder in the supply\r\nroom. It contains all the photographs we took of Mercurian plant and\r\nanimal life, and the photos of Vulcan. To say nothing of the data\r\nconcerning the sun\'s corona--why, our analysis would be of infinite\r\nvalue to earth scientists!"\r\n\r\n"Quite so," Rogers said crisply. 

"But while you\'re thinking about\r\nthat, don\'t forget the three men who would be left aboard this\r\nship--think of what would happen to them." He stopped his pacing and\r\nshook a finger under the doctor\'s imposing Van Dyke. "Do you know what\r\nwould happen to them, Geitz? They\'d burn alive--they\'d cook--while on\r\nearth your scientists would hop around in glee over a few photographs\r\nof Mercury!"\r\n\r\nGeitz sat down heavily, exhausted.\r\n\r\n"The doc\'s right, Rogers," Lane interposed. "There\'s no reason for all\r\nfour of us dying when it\'s possible for one to gain freedom. And for\r\nGod\'s sake if you\'re going to do something do it in a hurry! 

We\'ll burn\r\nbefore you make up your mind!"\r\n\r\n"My mind\'s made up," Rogers retorted. "I\'m staying. In case you\'ve\r\nforgotten, a captain is the last man to leave his ship. As for you\r\nthree, fight it out among yourselves. 

Draw straws--anything. The\r\nconsequences will be your worry."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll stay," murmured Lejeune, lifting his bottle to his lips.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean that," said the youthful Lane. "You want to go--we all\r\nwant to go--but it can only be one of us."\r\n\r\nHe fell silent, placing his head in his hands. Rogers resumed his\r\npacing.\r\n\r\nThe ship drifted on, slowly it seemed, ever nearing the solar furnace,\r\nfalling toward the flames that were eager to dissolve the tiny cruiser\r\nlocked in an unyielding gravitational pull.\r\n\r\n"Soon," mused Lejeune. "Soon we\'ll be too close for the rocket capsule\r\nto break free of the sun\'s drag. Then there will be no doubt as to what\r\nwill be done. 

Ha!"\r\n\r\n"Damnation!" yelled Lane, jerking erect. "How can you be so confounded\r\nhappy about it all? We\'re falling into the sun, man--doesn\'t that have\r\nany effect upon you?"\r\n\r\nLejeune shrugged. "Perhaps. We are falling into the sun, yes. We\'ll\r\ndie, no doubt, so my future is definite. I know what is coming. Soon I\r\nshall be but a tiny spark, drifting nowhere in a big sun. Do I regret\r\nbeing a tiny spark? Not when I have my scotch with me."\r\n\r\n"You\'re a smart guy," Lane thrust at him. "Maybe you can tell us how to\r\nchoose the rocket capsule\'s passenger."\r\n\r\n"Simple, my friend. The captain won\'t go--he must stay with the ship. I\r\nhave no relatives, only my scotch, so I am satisfied. The doctor must\r\nstay--he\'s too fat to get in the capsule. M\'sieu Lane, the honor is\r\nyours. 

Au revoir."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be crazy--"\r\n\r\n"Do not worry about us, my friend. We will find something to do.\r\nPerhaps I can interest the doctor and the captain in three-handed\r\nbridge. If not, we\'ll wait. 

We\'ll go soon--sssss! 

Like that."\r\n\r\nLane buried his face in his hands again.\r\n\r\nFor a few moments there was an unbroken silence. From the\r\ndouble-insulated hulls emanated a dry hotness that scorched the already\r\nblistered air. The hotness increased, rising to a fierce, intolerable\r\ndegree. It grew, inexorably, pressing against their lungs--\r\n\r\nLane floundered crazily, leaped across the control room and plucked a\r\ngun from his locker. "This\'ll make it easier," he gasped, lifting the\r\nweapon to his head. "Somebody\'s got to fly that capsule--"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Lane plucked a gun from his locker. "This\'ll make it\r\neasier," he gasped, lifting the weapon to his head._]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor ten minutes no one spoke. It was hard to speak--each breath was a\r\ntorture to the lungs.\r\n\r\n"Lejeune," said Geitz finally, in short gasps, "in God\'s name will you\r\nget into the capsule and take that cylinder to Mercury? One of us has\r\ngot to go--for Lane\'s sake!"\r\n\r\nLejeune, sprawled out on the pilot\'s bunk, made no reply. The captain\r\nstood before the dull gray view-screen, watched him a moment,\r\nthoughtfully. "Can\'t you reverse the field?" he asked at length. 

"I\'d\r\nlike to see the System just once more."\r\n\r\nRogers had already made a few deft motions on the instrument panel.\r\nPresently, the screen came to life. Its scope possessed a bright\r\nhalo--the sun\'s glow. In the center of the screen Mercury was visible,\r\na faint, receding globe. Rogers moved the scope slowly until he found\r\nthe feeble point of light that designated the earth. He watched it\r\ngrimly. 

"Satisfied, Geitz?"\r\n\r\n"Dr. Geitz is dead," came Lejeune\'s monotone.\r\n\r\nRogers turned. The doctor lay on his face, immobile and silent.\r\n\r\n"The heat," said Rogers, "and his age."\r\n\r\nThey carried him to the supply room, laid him beside the inert form of\r\nLane.\r\n\r\nThe two men stood watching earth\'s dull glimmer on the screen. The heat\r\npressed them relentlessly, always increasing--\r\n\r\n"Take the capsule, Lejeune. You\'ve no reason to remain."\r\n\r\n"I prefer to stay, Captain Rogers. You have relatives--it is only\r\nproper that you should fly the capsule."\r\n\r\n"Under any circumstances, Lejeune, the captain does not leave his ship\r\nin distress. Should I return to earth without the rest of you, I would\r\nlose my rank unquestionably. Now, before we draw too close, take the\r\ncylinder to Mercury! You\'re a fool not to!"\r\n\r\n"M\'sieu Rogers, I possess magnificent renown as a fool. I shall remain."\r\n\r\n"But the cylinder--"\r\n\r\n"The cylinder, Captain Rogers, be damned."\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other a long minute. Rogers, stripped to the waist,\r\nperspiring, his thick black hair hanging in his eyes; Lejeune, small,\r\nwiry, faint traces of a smile lurking on his lips.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the floor shook beneath them. A violent shudder passed through\r\nthe ship from stem to stern. The momentum of the sunward fall increased.\r\n\r\nRegaining his balance, Rogers gasped, "Good God--the capsule!"\r\n\r\nThey saw a flash of light on the screen, saw the tiny rocket streak\r\nfor Mercury in a flare of brilliance. It dwindled rapidly to a\r\nreceding speck that was swallowed in the depths of space.\r\n\r\nSpeechless, Rogers and Lejeune raced to the supply room. They found\r\nLane there, but no Geitz and no cylinder. Needles on the face of the\r\ncapsule compartment jutting out from the wall registered zero.\r\n\r\n"He was faking," said Rogers. "He wasn\'t dead--he merely pretended, the\r\ncoward!"\r\n\r\nLejeune took a quick drink, threw a sidelong glance at Lane\'s bloody\r\nform, and walked slowly back to the control room. Rogers followed. The\r\nclicking of their heels made a sullen echo upon the blistered walls.\r\n\r\nOn the screen, something dim and remote was moving, growing in size.\r\nRogers hastened forward in amazement.\r\n\r\n"It\'s Geitz!" he breathed. 

"Lord--he was too late--he\'s falling back!"\r\n\r\n"A pity," said Lejeune. "He has so much longer to wait now. It must be\r\nhorrible."\r\n\r\n"And the cylinder," Rogers sighed. "All that information will be lost."\r\nHis tired, bloodshot eyes followed the little capsule\'s course across\r\nthe screen, back toward the flaming sun.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps," remarked Lejeune, "there will be another expedition to\r\nMercury some day, another group of scientists, with a better ship and\r\nbetter equipment. And no meteorite will prevent their safe return to\r\nearth." He hesitated, took two tumblers from a nearby cabinet and\r\nfilled them with the remaining contents of his bottle. He handed one of\r\nthem to Rogers, took the other himself. "A final toast, Captain?"\r\n\r\nRogers accepted. "To the next Mercurian expedition, Lejeune."\r\n\r\n"The next expedition, Captain Rogers."\r\n\r\nThey drank, and Lejeune sucked in a breath. "I say--it\'s getting a bit\r\nwarm in here, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


What did\r\nthey mean? He shifted uncomfortably in the tight yellow suit, searching\r\nthe near horizon for ...\r\n\r\n_Where is it?_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA vague calling came from beyond the black sea curtain. Objectively,\r\nbecause he could do nothing to stop them, he watched his feet pick up,\r\nmove forward, put down; pick up, move forward, put down. Funny. He had\r\nthe feeling, the concept, that this action held meaning. It was supposed\r\nto cause some reaction, accomplish an act. He wondered at the regular\r\nmovement of his legs. One of them hurt. A hurt is a sensation of pain,\r\ncaused by over-loading sensory-units in the body; a hurt is bad, because\r\nit indicates something is wrong.\r\n\r\nSomething certainly was wrong. Something stirred in Cully\'s mind. He\r\nstopped and sat down on the sandy sea bottom, gracefully, like a ballet\r\ndancer. He examined his foot. There was a tiny hole in the yellow\r\nplastic fabric, and a thin string of red-black was oozing out. Blood. He\r\nknew.\r\n\r\nHe was bleeding. He could do nothing about it. He got up and resumed\r\nwalking.\r\n\r\n_Where is it?_\r\n\r\nCully lifted his head in annoyance at the sharp thought.\r\n\r\n"Go away," he said in a low, pleading voice. The sound made him feel\r\nbetter. He began muttering to himself.\r\n\r\n"Water, black, s-sand, hurt. Pain. Radio tanks ..."\r\n\r\nIt didn\'t sound right. After a few minutes, he was quiet. 

The\r\nmanythoughts were calling him. He must go to the manythoughts.\r\n\r\nIf his foot was bleeding, then something had happened; if something had\r\nhappened, then his foot was bleeding.\r\n\r\n"No!"\r\n\r\nIf something had happened, then maybe other things had happened--before\r\nthat. But how could something happen in a world of flat gold sand and\r\nflaccid sea? Surely there was something wrong. 

Wrong: the state of being\r\nnot-right; something had happened that was not-right. Cully stared at\r\nthe edges of the unmoving curtain before him.\r\n\r\n_Where is it?_\r\n\r\nIt was a driving, promise-filled concept. No words; just the sense that\r\nsomething wonderful lay just beyond reach. 

But this voice was different\r\nfrom the manythoughts. It was directing his body; his mind was along for\r\nthe ride.\r\n\r\nThe sameness of the sea and sand became unbearable. It was too-right,\r\nsomehow. Cully felt anger, and kicked up eddies of dust. It changed the\r\nsameness a little. He kicked more up, until it swirled around him in a\r\nthick gold haze, blotting out the terrible emptiness of the sea.\r\n\r\nHe felt another weight at his side. He found a holster and gun. He\r\nrecognized neither. Again he watched objectively as his hand pulled the\r\nblack object out and handled it. His body was evidently familiar with\r\nit, though it was strange to his eyes. His finger slipped automatically\r\ninto the trigger sheaf. His legs were still working under two drives:\r\nthe manythoughts\' urging, and something else, buried in him. A longing.\r\nUp-and-down, back-and-forth.\r\n\r\n_Where is it?_\r\n\r\nAnger, frustration flared in him. His hand shot out, gun at ready. He\r\nturned around slowly. Through the settling trail of suspended sand,\r\nnothing was visible.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAgain he was moving. Something made his legs move. He walked on through\r\nthe shrouds of Death until he felt a taut singing in his nerves. An\r\nirrational fear sprang out in him, cascading down his spine, and Cully\r\nshuddered. Ahead there was some_thing_. Two motives: get there because\r\nit (they?) calls; get there because you must.\r\n\r\n_Where is it?_\r\n\r\nThe mind-voice was excited, demanding. Something was out there,\r\nbesides the sameness. Cully walked on, trailing gold. The death-curtain\r\nparted ...\r\n\r\nAn undulating garden of blue-and-gold streamers suddenly drifted toward\r\nhim on an unfelt current. Cully was held, entranced. They flowed before\r\nhim, their colors dazzling, hypnotic.\r\n\r\n_Come closer, Earthling_, the manythoughts spoke inside his head,\r\nsoothingly.\r\n\r\n_Here it is!_ Cully\'s mind shouted.\r\n\r\nCully\'s mind was held, hypnotized, but his body moved of its own\r\nvolition.\r\n\r\nHe moved again. His mind and the manythoughts\' spoke:\r\nfulfillment--almost. 

There was one action left that must be completed.\r\n\r\nCully\'s arms moved. They detached the small black box from his pack. He\r\nmoved on into the midst of the weaving, gold-laced plants. Little\r\nspicules licked out from their flexing stalks and jabbed, unsensed, into\r\nCully\'s body to draw nourishment. From the manythoughts came the sense\r\nof complete fulfillment.\r\n\r\nFrom Cully\'s mind came further orders.\r\n\r\n_Lie down._ It was a collective concept. _Lie still. We are friends._\r\n\r\nHe could not understand. They were speaking words; words were beyond\r\nhim. His head shook in despair. 

The voices were implanting an emotion of\r\nhorror at what his hands were doing, but he had no control over his\r\nbody. It was as if it were not his.\r\n\r\nThe black box was now lying in the sand among the streaming plants.\r\nCully\'s fingers reached out and caressed a small panel. A soundless\r\n\'click\' ran through the murkiness. The strangely beautiful, gold-laced\r\nblue plants began a writhing dance. Their spicules withdrew and jabbed,\r\nwithdrew and jabbed. A rending, silent scream tore the quiet waters.\r\n\r\n_NO!_ they cried. It was a negative command, mixed in with the terrible\r\nscreaming. _Turn it off!_\r\n\r\n"Stop it, stop it!" Cully tried to say, but there were no words. He\r\ntried to cover his ears within the helmet, but the cries went on.\r\nEmotions roiled the water: pain, hurt, reproach. Cully sobbed. Something\r\nwas wrong here; something was killing the plants--the beautiful blue\r\nthings! The plants were withering, dying. He looked up at them,\r\nstupefied, not understanding, tears streaming down his face. What did\r\nthey want from him? What had he done ...\r\n\r\n_Where is it?_\r\n\r\nA different direction materialized; a new concept of desire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCully\'s body turned and crawled away from the wonderful, dying garden,\r\noblivious to the pleadings floating, now weakly, in the torpid water. He\r\nscuffed up little motes of golden sand, leaving a low-lying scud along\r\nthe bottom, back to the little black box in the garden. The plants, the\r\nbox, all were forgotten by now. Cully crawled on, not knowing why. A\r\nrise appeared; surprise caught Cully unaware. A change in the sameness!\r\n\r\n_Where is it?_\r\n\r\nAgain the voice was insistent. His desire was close ahead; he did not\r\nlook back at the black churning on the sea bottom. His legs worked, his\r\nchest heaved, words swirled in his mind. He topped the rise.\r\n\r\nBelow him, in the center of a shallow golden bowl, floated a long, shiny\r\ncylinder. Even from here he knew it was huge. He knew other things about\r\nit: how heavy it was; how it was; that it carried others of his kind. He\r\nhad been in it before. 

And they were waiting for him. He lurched on.\r\n\r\n"Captain! Here comes Cully!" the midshipman shouted from the airlock.\r\n"Look what they\'ve done to him!"\r\n\r\nThe old man\'s grey eyes took in the spectacle without visible emotion.\r\nHe watched the pathetic, bleeding yellow plastic sack crawl up to the\r\nship and look up. His hands reached down and lifted Cully up into the\r\nlock.\r\n\r\nThey took his suit off and stared with loathing at what had once been a\r\nman. A white scar zig-zagged across his forehead. The Captain bent\r\nclose, in range of the dim blue eyes.\r\n\r\n"It was a brave thing you did, Cully. The whole system will be grateful.\r\nVenus could never be colonized as long as those cannibals were there to\r\neat men, and drive men mad." Cully fingered the scar on his forehead,\r\nand looked unseeing into the old man\'s compassionate eyes. 

"I\'m sorry\r\nCully. 

We all are. 

But there was no other way. Prefrontal lobotomy,\r\ndestruction of your speech center ... it was the only way you could get\r\npast the telepaths and destroy them. I\'m sorry, Cully. 

The race of Man\r\nshall long honor your name."\r\n\r\nCully smiled at the old man, the words churning in his brain; but he did\r\nnot understand.\r\n\r\n_Where is it?_\r\n\r\nThe emptiness was still there.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ January 1963.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

"\r\n\r\n"I consider that an honor!" Frank snapped back.\r\n\r\nThen the music on the radio was cut off and the announcement was\r\nmade--in the calm, impersonal voice of the announcer that gave it a\r\nflavor of grotesque unreality....\r\n\r\n"--and so, although the discovery of the celestial interloper was made\r\nby astronomers some time ago, the announcement was delayed until all\r\ndoubt as to its orbit had been dispelled. Thus, a direct and dismal\r\nstatement becomes a matter of necessity--the earth is doomed--"\r\n\r\nFrank and Dee stared mutely at one another, trying to comprehend. "It\'s\r\nsome kind of a gag," Frank said.\r\n\r\nDee shook her head. "No--that was John Kalmus, the Green Network\r\ncommentator who cut in. He wouldn\'t be a party to any hoax."\r\n\r\nFrank knew this of course, but the destruction of the world was a\r\npretty big lump to swallow in a matter of seconds. They continued\r\nto stare at each other, taking the rest of the story into their\r\nnumbed minds. The end would come at exactly 1:42 on Sunday. Prior\r\nto that time, there would be vast weather disturbances and tidal\r\ncatastrophies the world over. But these would be far milder than what\r\nwould ordinarily be expected because the comet was moving at such a\r\ntremendous rate of speed. There would be no long-drawn out suffering.\r\n\r\n"At least that\'s a blessing," Dee said.\r\n\r\n"Uh-huh. Say--I\'ll bet the churches will be crowded."\r\n\r\n"No doubt." Dee paused, and added, "How long since we\'ve been to\r\nchurch, Frank?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere had been a cabinet meeting and now the President of the United\r\nStates was seated alone in his study. He picked up his phone and asked,\r\n"How about that call to the Kremlin? Why the delay?"\r\n\r\nThe operator said, "The Premier was busy on the phone--not taking any\r\ncalls, but it seems he was trying to get through to you. May I connect\r\nhim, sir?"\r\n\r\n"By all means."\r\n\r\nThe normally harsh voice of the Russian Premier was oddly quiet and\r\npensive. "Mr. President?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Premier. I was trying to get through to you."\r\n\r\n"They told me. How--how are things there? How are your people taking it\r\nin the United States?"\r\n\r\n"Very well. They are stunned, naturally, and I\'m sure quite a few of\r\nthem don\'t believe it. It will take a little time."\r\n\r\nThe Russian Premier chuckled with a note of wistfulness. "That\'s\r\nexactly what they will have--very little time."\r\n\r\n"And your people--?"\r\n\r\n"We haven\'t told them. We thought it best."\r\n\r\nThe President sighed. "We stick to our ideologies to the very end,\r\ndon\'t we?"\r\n\r\n"Policy can\'t be changed overnight. Yet great strides can be made."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I understand you."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll try to clarify. We finished our public statement Monday, setting\r\ndown our position on The Stockholm Conference last month."\r\n\r\n"The conference was a great disappointment to me--to you also, I\r\nimagine."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and our public statement was, well, pretty bleak, but I\'m\r\nchanging it. I\'m in the middle of rewriting it now."\r\n\r\n"I\'d like to sit down with you and perhaps readjust some of our own\r\ndemands."\r\n\r\n"I\'d like to have you."\r\n\r\n"No time now, of course."\r\n\r\n"No, in fact the rewriting may seem futile to you but it gives me great\r\nsatisfaction. A nice way to end a political career."\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you call me back and read it to me when you\'ve finished?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll do that. Goodbye Mr. 

President."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrank and Dee Allison walked hand in hand down the street. Dee had been\r\ncrying but now her tears had been dried and her expression was calm.\r\nThere was a wistful light in her eyes. "It could have been so much\r\ndifferent, Frank."\r\n\r\n"Yes darling. My fault. It was my damn temper."\r\n\r\n"But I was always ready to snarl back. A wife\'s job is to--"\r\n\r\nHe squeezed her hand. "Are you afraid, baby?"\r\n\r\n"No--no. 

I won\'t be afraid as long as you\'re there to hold my hand."\r\n\r\nHe put his arm around her shoulders and drew her close and they walked\r\nwith the other people toward the Church.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States put through a call to the Premier\r\nof Russia. Connections clicked into place across half a world and the\r\nRussian operator\'s voice came through warm and cordial. "Of course, Mr.\r\nPresident. The Premier\'s wire is always open to you. I\'ll ring him."\r\n\r\nThe phone was lifted instantly. "Mr. 

President! How nice of you to\r\ncall!"\r\n\r\n"Our previous conversation set me thinking, Mr. Premier. I want to be a\r\npart of your inspiring idea. So I\'m rewriting our own statement and I\r\nsuggest we make a joint public release. I think it will help the people\r\nof the world to face the end with greater dignity. The _knowing_--I\r\nthink--will help.

"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure it will. How soon will your draft be finished?"\r\n\r\n"Can you give me another two hours?"\r\n\r\n"Of course. Ring me when you\'re ready. Perhaps we can set up an\r\ninternational television hookup and appear together."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure we can."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrank and Dee Allison came out of church bringing some of the peace\r\nand the strength with them. Dee said, "I\'d like to see my mother for a\r\nlittle while before--before--"\r\n\r\nFrank nodded. "Of course. 

And I think you should drop in on her alone."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no--I--"\r\n\r\n"A goodbye like this one should be said alone. You go up. I\'ll give you\r\nfifteen minutes and then call for you."\r\n\r\nDee\'s eyes were misty. "You\'re so understanding. Oh, why couldn\'t we\r\nhave--"\r\n\r\nFrank grinned. "Come on, angel. 

Heads up. 

Eyes bright."\r\n\r\nThey walked up the street, others around them going quietly about their\r\nbusiness. The people were very calm.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe conference of astronomers and scientists realized their ghastly\r\nblunder at 11:59 a.m. For a long moment, there was stunned silence in\r\nthe room. None of them could believe that such a progressive series of\r\nerrors could have been passed from man to man and been added to by\r\neach. Through every mind went the dread of what would come out of this.\r\nIn the future it would be called the greatest hoax of all time. There\r\nwould be gigantic investigations. Possibly a goat would have to be\r\nfound. The world would never believe the truth.\r\n\r\n"We might as well make the announcement," someone said.\r\n\r\n"You make it," another scientist said. "I\'m leaving for the North Pole."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrank Allison heard the announcement from a loudspeaker in a store\r\nwindow on his sixth trip around the block. He\'d been walking slowly,\r\ndeep in his own thoughts and regrets--giving Dee a little more time\r\nwith her mother. Then--\r\n\r\n"--so the great danger is passed, ladies and gentlemen. 

The why and\r\nthe wherefore of it is not known at this time. We are only sure of one\r\nthing: The comet will swing away into space. Rumor has it that the size\r\nof the invading body was what threw our scientists off. But whether\r\nthe earlier announcement was sincere or merely a cruel joke will not\r\nbe known immediately. The main thing is to be thankful that an error\r\nexisted--whatever its cause--"\r\n\r\nFrank straightened his shoulders, turned and started briskly up the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States put a call through to the Russian\r\nPremier. He awaited expectantly with the phone in his hand. But the\r\nconnections slipped into place slowly and five minutes later a voice\r\ncame across half a world. "The Premier is busy. Please inform the\r\nPresident of the United States that the Premier is engaged. Inform the\r\nPresident that I am able to connect him with the Premier\'s secretary.\r\nAsk him if that will be satisfactory."\r\n\r\nThe frost in the voice seemed to chill the President\'s ear. "I will\r\ntalk to the Premier\'s secretary."\r\n\r\nThe Secretary\'s voice was careful, guarded. "May I help you, Mr.\r\nPresident?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you can. I had a conversation with the Premier a little over\r\nan hour ago. We were planning a joint statement--a joint television\r\nappearance."\r\n\r\nThe secretary\'s voice stiffened. "I\'m sorry, but I know of no such\r\nstatement nor of any such plans on the part of the Premier.\'"\r\n\r\n"May I speak to the Premier?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry. The Premier has left on an extended vacation."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry too," the President said, and cradled the phone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDee Allison sat tight-eyed staring out the window. Her handkerchief was\r\nballed into a wad in her hand. "He\'s so cruel--so thoughtless," she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nHer mother regarded her with resignation. "What do you want me to tell\r\nhim when he comes?"\r\n\r\n"Tell him I never want to see him again!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrank Allison got as far as the lobby of the building in which Mrs.\r\nGregg, Dee\'s mother, lived. He raised his hand and his finger was\r\ninches from the bell. Then he doubled the hand into a fist and thrust\r\nit into his pocket. "The hell with it!" 

he growled. 

"If she wants to\r\nsee me, she knows where to find me." He turned and strode out of the\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States had sat staring into space for a\r\nlong time. A sound caused him to look up. His secretary stood by the\r\ndesk. "Yes?"\r\n\r\n"This new statement you just prepared, Mr. President. 

I\'m not entirely\r\nclear on how you plan to use it--what should I do?"\r\n\r\n"Tear it up," the President said wearily, "and throw it in the\r\nwastebasket. 

Things are now back to normal."\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\n              Jack\'s blunder was disastrous, but what he\r\n           worried about was: would Einstein have approved?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Gretch:\r\n\r\nMrs. Burroughs and I are sending your son Jack to you because we do not\r\nknow what else to do with him. As you can see, we can\'t keep him with\r\nus in his present condition.\r\n\r\nAlso, Jack owes us two weeks rent and, since Mrs. Burroughs and I are\r\nretired, we would appreciate your sending the money. It has been a dry\r\nyear and our garden has done poorly.\r\n\r\nThe only reason we put up with your son in the first place was because\r\nwe are so hard-pressed.\r\n\r\nHe saw the sign on the porch, rang the bell and paid Mrs. Burroughs a\r\nmonth\'s rent without even looking at the room. Then he ran out to his\r\ncar and commenced pulling out suitcases and boxes and dragging them\r\nupstairs.\r\n\r\nAfter the third trip, Mrs. Burroughs saw he was having trouble with\r\nthe stuff and he looked kind of worn out, so she offered to help.\r\n\r\nHe gave her a hard look, as she described it to me when I got home. He\r\nsaid, "I don\'t want anyone touching anything. Please don\'t interfere."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t mean to interfere," my wife told him. "I only wanted to help."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want any help," he said quietly, but with a wild look in his\r\neye, and he staggered upstairs with the last of his baggage and locked\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen I got home, Mrs. Burroughs told me she thought I ought to take\r\na look at the new boarder. I went up, thinking we\'d have a little\r\nchat and straighten things out. 

I could hear him inside, hammering on\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\nHe didn\'t hear my first knock or the second. I got sore and nearly\r\nbanged the door down, at which time he decided to open up.\r\n\r\nI charged in, ready to fight a bear. And there was this skinny\r\nred-headed son of yours glaring at me.\r\n\r\n"That\'s a lot of hammering you\'re doing, son," I said.\r\n\r\n"That\'s the only way I can get these boxes open, and don\'t call me son."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like to disturb you, Mr. 

Gretch, but Mrs. Burroughs is a\r\nlittle upset over the way you acted today. I think you ought to come\r\ndown for a cup of tea and get acquainted."\r\n\r\n"I know I was rude," he said, looking a little ashamed, "but I have\r\nwaited for years for a chance to get to work on my own, with no\r\ninterference. I\'ll come down tomorrow, when I have got my equipment set\r\nup, and apologize to Mrs. Burroughs then."\r\n\r\nI asked him what he was working on, but he said he would explain later.\r\nBefore I got out of the door, he was hammering again. He worked till\r\nafter midnight.\r\n\r\nWe saw Jack at mealtimes for the next few days, but he didn\'t talk\r\nmuch. We learned that he was twenty-six, in spite of his looking like a\r\nboy in his teens, that he thought Prof. Einstein the greatest man ever,\r\nand that he disliked being called son. Of his experiment, he didn\'t\r\nhave much to say then. 

He saw Mrs. Burroughs was a little nervous about\r\nhis experimenting in the guest room and he assured her it was not\r\ndangerous.\r\n\r\nBefore the week was out, we started hearing the noises. The first one\r\nwas like a wire brush going around a barrel. It went _whisk, whisk_.\r\nThen he rigged up something that went _skaboom_ every few seconds, like\r\na loud heartbeat. Once in a while, he got in a sound like a creaky\r\nwell pump, but mostly it was _skaboom_ and _whisk_, which eventually\r\nsettled down to a steady rhythm, _whiskaboom, whiskaboom_.\r\n\r\nIt was kind of pleasant.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNeither of us saw him for two days. The noises kept going on. Mrs.\r\nBurroughs was alarmed because he did not answer her knock at mealtimes,\r\nand one morning she charged upstairs and hollered at him through the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n"You stop your nonsense this minute and come down to breakfast!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not hungry," he called back.\r\n\r\n"You open this door!" she ordered and, by George, he did. "Your\r\n_whiskaboom_ or whatever it is will keep till after breakfast."\r\n\r\nHe sat at the table, but he was a tired boy. He had a cold, his eyelids\r\nkept batting, and I don\'t believe he could have lifted his coffee cup.\r\nHe tried to look awake, and then over he went with his face in the\r\noatmeal.\r\n\r\nMrs. Burroughs ran for the ammonia, but he was out cold, so we wiped\r\nthe oatmeal off his face and carried him upstairs.\r\n\r\nMy wife rubbed Jack\'s wrists with garlic and put wet towels on his\r\nface, and presently he came to. He looked wildly about the room at his\r\nmachinery. 

It was all there, and strange-looking stuff, too.\r\n\r\n"Please go away," he begged. "I\'ve got work to do."\r\n\r\nMrs. Burroughs helped him blow his nose. "There\'ll be no work for you,\r\nsonny. Not until you\'re well. 

We\'ll take care of you." He didn\'t seem\r\nto mind being called sonny.\r\n\r\nHe was sick for a week and we tended him like one of our own. We got to\r\nknow him pretty well. 

And we also got to know you.\r\n\r\nNow, Mr. Gretch, whatever you are doing in your laboratory is your own\r\nbusiness. You could be making atomic disintegrators, for all Jack told\r\nus. But he does not like or approve of it and he told us about your\r\nrunning battle with him to keep him working on your project instead of\r\nhis own.\r\n\r\nJack tried to explain his ideas for harnessing time and what he called\r\n"the re-integration principle." It was all so much _whiskaboom_ to us,\r\nso to speak, but he claimed it was for the good of mankind, which was\r\nfine with us.\r\n\r\nBut he said you would not let him work it out because there was less\r\nmoney in it than in your project, and this is why he had to get away\r\nand work and worry himself into a collapse.\r\n\r\nWhen he got well, Mrs. Burroughs told him, "From now on, you\'re going\r\nto have three meals a day and eight hours sleep, and in between you can\r\nplay on your _whiskaboom_ all you please."\r\n\r\nThe _whiskabooming_ became as familiar to us as our own voices.\r\n\r\nLast Sunday, Mrs. Burroughs and I came home from church, about noon.\r\nShe went inside through the front door to fix dinner. I walked around\r\nthe house to look at the garden. And the moment I walked past the front\r\nof the house, I got the shock of my life.\r\n\r\nThe house disappeared!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI was too surprised to stop walking, and a step later I was standing at\r\nthe back of the house, and it was all there. I took a step back and the\r\nwhole house vanished again. One more step and I was at the front.\r\n\r\nIt looked like a real house in front and in back, but there wasn\'t any\r\nin-between. It was like one of those false-front saloons on a movie\r\nlot, but thinner.\r\n\r\nI thought of my wife, who had gone into the kitchen and, for all I\r\nknew, was as thin as the house, and I went charging in the back door,\r\nyelling.\r\n\r\n"Are you all right?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I\'m all right," she said. 

"What\'s the matter with you?

"\r\n\r\nI grabbed her and she was all there, thank heavens. She giggled and\r\ncalled me an old fool, but I dragged her outside and showed her what\r\nhad happened to our house.\r\n\r\nShe saw it, too, so I knew I didn\'t have sunstroke, but she couldn\'t\r\nunderstand it any better than I.\r\n\r\nRight about then, I detected a prominent absence of _whiskabooming_.\r\n"Jack!" I hollered, and we hurried back into the house and upstairs.\r\n\r\nWell, Mr. Gretch, it was so pitiful, I can\'t describe it. He was there,\r\nbut I never saw a more miserable human being. He was not only thin but\r\nalso flat, like a cartoon of a man who had been steamrollered. He was\r\nlying on the bed, holding onto the covers, with no more substance to\r\nhim than a thin piece of paper. 

Less.\r\n\r\nMrs. Burroughs took one of his shoulders between her thumb and\r\nforefinger, and I took the other, and we held him up. There was a\r\nbreeze coming through the window and Jack--well, he waved in the breeze.\r\n\r\nWe closed the window and laid him down again and he tried to explain\r\nwhat had happened. "Professor Einstein wouldn\'t have liked this!" he\r\nmoaned. "Something went wrong," he cried, shuddering.\r\n\r\nHe went on gasping and mumbling, and we gathered that he had hooked up\r\na circuit the wrong way. "I didn\'t harness the fourth--I chopped off\r\nthe third dimension! Einstein wouldn\'t have approved!"\r\n\r\nHe was relieved to learn that the damage had been confined to himself\r\nand the house, so far as we knew. Like the house, Jack had insides, but\r\nwe don\'t know where they are. We poured tea down him, and he can eat,\r\nafter a fashion, but there never is a sign of a lump anywhere.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat night, we pinned him to the bed with clothespins so he wouldn\'t\r\nblow off the bed. Next morning, we rigged a line and pinned him to it\r\nso he could sit up.\r\n\r\n"I know what to do," he said, "but I would have to go back to the lab.\r\nDad would have to let me have his staff and all sorts of equipment. And\r\nhe won\'t do it."\r\n\r\n"If he thinks more of his money than he does of his own son," Mrs.\r\nBurroughs said, "then he\'s an unnatural father."\r\n\r\nBut Jack made us promise not to get in touch with you.\r\n\r\nStill, people are beginning to talk. The man from the electric company\r\ncouldn\'t find the meter yesterday, because it is attached to the middle\r\nof the outside wall and has vanished.\r\n\r\nMr. Gretch, we are parents and we feel that you will not hesitate a\r\nmoment to do whatever is necessary to get Jack back into shape. So,\r\ndespite our promise, we are sending Jack to you by registered parcel\r\npost, air mail. He doesn\'t mind the cardboard mailing tube he is rolled\r\nup in as he has been sleeping in it, finding it more comfortable than\r\nbeing pinned to the sheets.\r\n\r\nJack is a fine boy, sir, and we hope to hear soon that he is back to\r\nnormal and doing the work he wants to do.\r\n\r\nVery truly yours,\r\n\r\nW. Burroughs\r\n\r\nP.S. When Jack figures out the re-integration principle, we would\r\nappreciate his fixing our house. We get along as usual, but it makes us\r\nnervous to live in a house that, strictly speaking, has no insides. W.B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


Fellow IRE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Jan. 

25._\r\n\r\nLast night, in my dreams, I was a monstrous ant, and had been digging\r\nmyself a burrow in the soft fresh earth. The dream was intensely real,\r\nand when I awoke, I felt as tired as if I had actually been digging. My\r\narms ached, and I was astonished, upon examining my hands, to find them\r\nraw.\r\n\r\nDressing hastily, I rushed to the back yard, and there, sure enough,\r\nnear the fence, was a large hole about two feet deep and three feet\r\nlong. Hurriedly, I filled it in and returned to the house.\r\n\r\nI must rest for a few days, as I feel that the intense excitement caused\r\nby my investigations, is preying too heavily upon my mind.\r\n\r\nAt this time, I feel that I should make a brief summary of my findings\r\nin respect to the ants, so that Barclay may go over these notes upon his\r\nreturn from his vacation.\r\n\r\n_First:_ The ant colony is the source of a powerful bell-like tone which\r\nis radiated continuously on two wave-lengths, .0018 meter, and .00176\r\nmeter. This tone acts as a radio-beacon, and directs the ants to the\r\ncolony, no matter where they may be located. 

The .0018 meter wave is\r\nused by the ants for their "clacking" conversations, by means of which\r\nthey communicate with each other and the colony, receiving orders from\r\nthe directing intelligence, reporting the location of food, and\r\nrequesting help, when needed.\r\n\r\nThe wave .00176 meter, is used for sending thought images or pictures\r\nwhich may be sent with the "clacking" code, or independently. I cannot\r\nconceive a more efficient or highly specialized communications system. 

I\r\n_must_ learn their secret, their methods.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Jan. 30._\r\n\r\nThis morning, while sitting at the receiver in a semi-doze, with the\r\nbell-tone ringing in my ears, I fell into that state known as\r\n"day-dreaming." Little "Nippy," my beloved fox terrier, and constant\r\ncompanion, rushed into the laboratory and ran up to me.\r\n\r\nFor a moment my mind went blank. My hands shot out. I grasped the dog\r\naround the throat and began to throttle him. I had risen from my chair,\r\nand the dog was nearly dead, when I slipped and fell, pulling the phone\r\nplug out of the receiver.\r\n\r\nInstantly, my mind cleared, and words cannot express the remorse I felt\r\nat my inhuman actions. Nippy would have nothing to do with me, and\r\ncrawled dejectedly from the room, a terrified look in his eyes.\r\n\r\nI have no explanation for my actions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Feb. 3._\r\n\r\nThe transmitter is ready for operation. 

I have constructed a pair of\r\nmetal disc-electrodes which clamp tightly to my head and press upon my\r\ntemples. This device will pick up the thought impulses from my brain,\r\nfeed them directly into the radio-frequency amplifier, where they will\r\nbe amplified, and then radiated in a tight directed beam.\r\n\r\nMy two ants were in their little enclosure under the microscope when I\r\nthrew the switch to the "send" position. I pictured myself as I looked\r\nas a man, and sent the thought, "I am a man."\r\n\r\nHastily, I threw the switch to the "receive" position. I looked through\r\nthe microscope.\r\n\r\nThe ants were lying on their sides. Somehow, I felt that the power was\r\ntoo great, and had stunned them. Keeping my eye to the microscope, I\r\nagain threw the switch to "send," and cut the power to half.\r\n\r\n"Get up, friends ... get up," I thought, as I pictured them rising. Sure\r\nenough ... the ants slowly regained their feet. They looked about in\r\napparent bewilderment. Back again, in "receive" position, I was\r\nconscious of the thought image,\r\n\r\n"The man ... he is the man. The man holds us here. He is killing us. We\r\nmust kill the man."\r\n\r\nThey gnashed their fierce-looking mandibles. I snapped back to "send"\r\nand thought.\r\n\r\n"No ... you must not kill the man. The man will not harm you ... he is\r\nyour friend. 

He will help you."\r\n\r\nAs I watched, the ants seemed to become less excited. From the larger of\r\nthe two, I received the thought,\r\n\r\n"We are dying. The man is killing us with his strong vibrations. We\r\nmust kill the man."\r\n\r\nThen a very powerful thought impression burst upon my brain.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to come from the colony, three feet away.\r\n\r\n"Warning to the man. Stop your thought transmissions at once! Your\r\nvibrations are killing us. We want nothing from you. We have everything\r\nwe need. You will learn nothing from us. You will stop _at once_!"\r\n\r\nI threw the switch to "send." Viewed through the microscope, the two\r\nants were lying on their backs ... dead, to all appearances.\r\n\r\n"What if I don\'t stop?" I sent the thought question, "I want to learn\r\nthe secret of your communication. In return, I will teach you many\r\nthings. I can\'t stop now!"\r\n\r\nI changed to receive, and the answer came back,\r\n\r\n"If you do not stop ... we will kill you!"\r\n\r\nI turned off the apparatus, but the powerful bell tone continued to\r\npound incessantly into my brain.\r\n\r\nI laughed. They\'d kill me ... would they? Those tiny insects ... what\r\ncould they do? Well--let them try, but I\'d get what I was after. I would\r\nnot quit now, with success so near. What if my transmissions did kill a\r\nfew of them? Of what importance were the lives of a few ants as compared\r\nto the advancement of the science of Communication?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Feb. 9._\r\n\r\nI found myself digging again in the back yard yesterday. As before, I\r\nhad been "day-dreaming," when an overwhelming desire to go outside and\r\nfeel the cool moist earth between my fingers and on my face took\r\npossession of me.\r\n\r\nI rushed out into the back yard, and began digging feverishly ... madly,\r\nuntil finally I fell, exhausted. Then my mind cleared and I filled in\r\nthe hole.\r\n\r\nAbout half the ants have died, due no doubt to the strength of my\r\nradiations. No matter how low I cut the power, they still cannot live\r\nbut a short time under the force of my transmissions. They have stopped\r\nsending thought impressions entirely, and are using only their\r\n"clacking" code signals, which they seem to realize I cannot understand.\r\n\r\nI feel that they are undertaking some sort of campaign against me. For\r\nhours they congregate, closely packed, their antennae stiffly pointed\r\nstraight up. Their thought currents seem to be flowing into and merging\r\nwith the bell tone, which grows stronger and more penetrating day by\r\nday.\r\n\r\nIn my back yard, there are four large ant hills, and at each hill,\r\ncuriously, there is no activity except the same mass concentration of\r\nthe ants. Have they, too, been affected by my radiations and joined\r\nforces with the original colony against myself?\r\n\r\nThe bell tone continues to grow stronger.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Feb. 11_\r\n\r\nMrs. 

Winslow, the middle-aged widow, who comes to clean my house and\r\nlaboratory twice a week, was here this morning.\r\n\r\nShe is short, dumpy, and inclined to be stout. As she went about her\r\nwork, I noticed particularly the fat firm flesh of her neck, just below\r\nthe jaw. I felt an uncontrollable desire to sink my teeth deep into that\r\nflesh, and enjoy the taste of the warm fresh blood.\r\n\r\nI had actually risen from my chair to accomplish my desire, when the\r\ntelephone rang ... and my mind cleared.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Feb. 14._\r\n\r\nI have decided to stop my experiments with the ants.\r\n\r\nAs they refuse to send any more thought impressions, there is nothing\r\nfurther I can learn from them. Somehow, I feel that they are gaining a\r\nhold upon my mind, and that every time I listen in on the receiver, that\r\nhold becomes stronger. I firmly believe that I would have attacked poor\r\nMrs. Winslow, had not the ringing of the \'phone so opportunely\r\ninterrupted me. I have sent word for her to stay away ... as I cannot\r\ntrust myself.\r\n\r\nI keep a box of fresh earth on the table in my laboratory. I often run\r\nmy hands through it, and taste it. 

It is remarkable how much this\r\nsoothes my nerves.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Feb. 16._\r\n\r\nIt is too late!\r\n\r\nFor two days, I have kept my apparatus shut off. I have not so much as\r\nlooked at the ants, but still that confounded bell tone rings in my ears\r\nwith all the insistence of African tom-toms. Hour by hour ... the tone\r\nbecomes more penetrating. I cannot sleep, and can eat but little.\r\n\r\nAs a last resort, I destroyed my ant colony. I even went so far as to\r\npour boiling water on the four ant hills in my yard.\r\n\r\nStill ... the bell tone persists. I can stand it no longer!\r\n\r\nPerhaps if I were to dig ... again in the yard ... in the soothing\r\nearth, I could forget....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(News Clipping: From Philadelphia Banner)\r\n\r\nRADIO COMMUNICATIONS ENGINEER DEAD\r\n\r\nHoward E. Edwards, Suicide\r\n\r\n_Philadelphia, Feb. 18._ The body of Howard E. Edwards, B.S., PhD.,\r\nMember I. R. E., eminent authority on Radio Communications, aged 56, was\r\nfound this morning in the back yard of his residence, 1427 Raines\r\nAvenue. The body was almost completely buried in a long narrow hole in\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nAt first, foul-play was suspected, but later it appeared that Edwards\r\nhad dug himself into the ground and died of suffocation, as his nostrils\r\nand mouth were filled with dirt.\r\n\r\nDr. P. A. Hofner, who examined the body, found no wounds, stated that\r\nEdwards had been dead for about two days, and pronounced the death as a\r\nclear case of suicide, the strange means employed probably due to an\r\nunbalanced mental condition.\r\n\r\nElaborate radio apparatus upon which Edwards had been working had been\r\nsmashed to bits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\nThis etext was produced from _Comet_ July 1941.

he complained,\r\ntugging at the extremely "historical" sword that completed the effect\r\nof his dazzling white and gold uniform.\r\n\r\nCommodore Miller, his aide, stiffened nervously.\r\n\r\n"Around to the right of it, sir," he gestured. "As you see, the local\r\nmilitary are already keeping the route clear of onlookers. We thought\r\nit would be most impressive if your party were to descend the outer\r\nstairway from the palace balcony here ... to heighten the importance\r\nof--"\r\n\r\n"To draw out the pomp and circumstance of opening the conference?"\r\n\r\n"Well, sir ... and then across the square to the conference hall of\r\nthe capitol, outside which you will pause for a few gracious words to\r\nthe crowd--"\r\n\r\n"And that will probably be my last opportunity to enjoy the morning\r\nsunlight. Oh, well, it seems much too bright here in any case."\r\n\r\nThe commodore absently reached out to adjust a fold of his chief\'s\r\nsky-blue sash, and the marshal as absently parried the gesture.\r\n\r\n"I shall be hardly less than half an hour crossing the square," he\r\npredicted sourly. "With the cheering throngs they have undoubtedly\r\narranged, and the sunlight reflecting from all that imitation marble,\r\nit will be no place to collect one\'s thoughts."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe turned back to the huge chamber constituting the "office" of the\r\nsuite supplied by his Polluxian hosts. The skeleton staff of men and\r\nwomen remaining occupied chairs and benches along only one wall, since\r\nthe bulk of the delegation had been sent out to make themselves\r\npopular with the local populace.\r\n\r\nHennings presumed the bulk of the local populace to consist of\r\nPolluxians assigned to making themselves popular with his Ursan\r\nFederation delegation. His people would be listening politely to\r\nmyriad reasons why the Polluxians had a natural right to occupy all\r\nthe star systems from here to Castor, a dozen light-years farther\r\nfrom Terra. No one would mention the true motive--their illogical\r\nchoice in naming themselves the Twin Empire.\r\n\r\n"Well, now!" he said crisply. 

"Once more over the main points of the\r\nsituation! No, commodore, not the schedule of experts that will\r\naccompany me to the table; I rely upon you to have perfected that. But\r\nhave there been any unforeseen developments in the actual fighting?"\r\n\r\nA cluster of aides, mostly in uniform but including a few in\r\ndiscreetly elegant civilian attire, moved forward. Each was somehow\r\nfollowed within arm\'s reach by an aide of his own, so that the advance\r\npresented overtones of a small sortie.\r\n\r\nHennings first nodded to the first, a youngish man whose air suggested\r\ntechnical competence more than the assurance of great authority. The\r\nofficer placed his brief case upon the glistening surface of a large\r\ntable and touched a switch on the flap.\r\n\r\n"It\'s as well to be sure, sir," the commodore approved. "Our men have\r\nbeen unable to detect any devices, but the walls may have ears."\r\n\r\n"They won\'t scan through this scrambler, sir," asserted the young\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\nHennings accepted a seat at the table and looked up to one of the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n"Mirelli\'s Star," an older officer reported briskly. "The same\r\nsituation prevails, with both sides having landed surface troops in\r\nforce on Mirelli II, Mirelli III, and Mirelli V, the fourth planet\r\nbeing inhabited by a partly civilized, nonhuman race protected under\r\nthe Terran Convention."\r\n\r\n"Recent engagements?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir. Maneuvering continues, but actual encounters have declined\r\nin frequency. Casualties are modest and evenly matched. General\r\nNilssen on Mirelli III continues to receive Polluxian agents seeking\r\nhis defection."\r\n\r\n"I never thought to ask," murmured Hennings. "Is he really a distant\r\nconnection of the Polluxian Nilssen family?"\r\n\r\n"It is improbable, sir, but they are polite enough to accept the\r\npretense. Of course, he rejects every offer in a very high-minded\r\nmanner, and seems to be making an adequate impression of chivalry."\r\n\r\nHe stepped back at Henning\'s nod, to be replaced by another officer.\r\n\r\n"One minor space skirmish in the Agohki system to report, sir. The\r\nadmiral in command appears to have recouped after the error of two\r\ndays ago, when that Polluxian detachment was so badly mauled. He\r\narranged the capture of three of our cruisers."\r\n\r\n"Was that not a trifle rash?" demanded Hennings.\r\n\r\n"Intelligence is inclined to think not, sir. The ships were armed only\r\nwith weapons listed as general knowledge items. The crews were not\r\nonly trained in prisoner-of-war tactics, but also well supplied with\r\nsmall luxuries. The Polluxian fleet in that system is known to have\r\nbeen in space for several months, so a friendly effect is\r\nanticipated."\r\n\r\nHennings considered the condensed report proffered for his perusal. He\r\nnoted that the Polluxians had been quite gentlemanly about notifying\r\nUrsan headquarters of the capture and of the complete lack of\r\ncasualties. He also saw that while the message was ostensibly directed\r\nto the Federation flagship, it had been beamed in such fashion as to\r\nbe conveniently intercepted at the secret Ursan Federation\r\nheadquarters on Agohki VII.\r\n\r\n"That was a bit rude of them," he commented. "We have never dragged\r\ntheir secrets into the open."\r\n\r\n"On the other hand, sir," the commodore suggested, "it may be an\r\nalmost sophisticated method of permitting us to enjoy our superior\r\nfinesse."\r\n\r\n"I am just as pleased to have the reminder," said Hennings. 

"It will\r\nserve to alert us all the more when we sit down with them over there."\r\n\r\nAn elegant civilian, a large man with patient, drooping features,\r\nstated that nothing had occurred to change the economic situation.\r\nAnother reported that unofficial channels of information were holding\r\nup as well as could be expected. A uniformed officer summarized the\r\nbattle situation in two more star systems.\r\n\r\n"Those are positions we actually desire to hold, are they not?"\r\nHennings asked. 

"Is action to be taken there?"\r\n\r\n"Plans call for local civilian riots at the height of the conference,\r\nsir."\r\n\r\n"But ... can we lay no groundwork sooner than that? Sometime in the\r\nforeseeable future, at least! 

Take it up with Propaganda, Blauvelt! It\r\nseems to me that the briefing mentioned an indigenous race on one of\r\nthese planets--"\r\n\r\nBlauvelt dropped his eyes momentarily, equivalent in that gathering to\r\na blush of intense embarrassment. Hennings coughed apologetically.\r\n\r\n"Well, now, I should not pry into arrangements I must later be able to\r\ndeny convincingly with a clear conscience. 

I can only plead, my dear\r\nBlauvelt, the tenseness of the past several days."\r\n\r\nThe officer murmured inaudibly, fumbled with his papers, and edged to\r\nthe rear rank. Someone, at Commodore Miller\'s fluttering, obtained a\r\nvacuum jug of ice water and a glass for the marshal, but Hennings\r\nchose instead to produce a long cigar from a pocket concealed beneath\r\nhis resplendent collection of medals.\r\n\r\n"My apologies to all of you," he said thoughtfully. "I fear that any\r\nof you who may expect contact with the local population had better see\r\nDr. Ibn Talal about the hypnosis necessary to counteract my little\r\nindiscretion. And now--what remains?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing but the prisoner exchange, sir," Commodore Miller announced\r\nafter collecting the eyes of the principal officers.\r\n\r\nHennings got his cigar going. He listened to confirmation of a\r\nprevious report that a massive exchange of "sick and wounded"\r\nprisoners had been accomplished, and learned that the Ursans now\r\nsuspected that they had accepted unknowingly about as many secret\r\nagents as they had sent the Polluxians.\r\n\r\n"Oh, well!" he sighed. 

"As long as the amenities were preserved! We\r\nmust be as friendly as possible about that sort of thing, or run the\r\nrisk of antagonizing them."\r\n\r\nSeeing that the commodore was tense with impatience, the marshal rose\r\nto his feet. An aide deftly received the cigar for disposal, and the\r\nparty drifted expectantly toward the balcony doors.\r\n\r\nFrom among that part of the staff which would remain to man\r\nheadquarters, an officer was dispatched to alert the Polluxian honor\r\nguard.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_One more touch before the die is cast_, thought the marshal, as two\r\nyoung officers opened the balcony doors to admit the blare of\r\ntrumpets.\r\n\r\nCheers rolled successively across the square, rising like distant\r\nwaves from somewhere beneath the gigantic banner that draped the\r\ncapitol opposite with fiery letters spelling out "PEACE CONFERENCE."\r\n\r\nWith a dramatic gesture, Hennings held up the sheaf of reports they\r\nhad just reviewed. Smiles disappeared in response to his own serious\r\nmien.\r\n\r\n"So much for the hostilities!" he snapped. 

He tossed the reports to\r\nthe officer who would remain in charge. "_Now for the actual war!_"\r\n\r\nPivoting on his heel, he led them smartly out to the ornate balcony\r\nstairway that curved down into the sea of cheering Polluxians.\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s The Outbreak of Peace, by Horace Brown Fyfe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n


Or the time he let a\r\nmouse loose among the female students to illustrate chain reaction. Or\r\nthe afternoon he played boogie-woogie on the Huyler Memorial Carillon.\r\n\r\n"The absorption of knowledge," he used to say, "increases in direct\r\nproportion to the sense of humor--the belly laugh, measured in decibels,\r\nbeing constant."\r\n\r\nHe could say a thing like that and make it sound funnier than anybody\r\nelse could. It was partly the way he looked--tall and mournful and sly,\r\nwith wispy hair that had once been blond, drooping like a tired willow\r\nover his forehead.\r\n\r\nBut for all his vaudeville tactics he was by no means a second-rate\r\nscientist. Which was why he had gained his position at Southwestern\r\nTech in the first place. He refused to work directly for the government\r\n(no sense of humor, just initials, he said) but this way he could at\r\nleast be called upon for consultation at the nearby Air Force\r\nDevelopment Center, just at the foot of the mountains to the west.\r\n\r\nNow the AFDC, as it was called, didn\'t advertise what sort of thing it\r\nwas developing--but everybody knew that Lyman Dane was an expert on\r\nreactive propulsion of rocket motors. He could tell you--and frequently\r\nwould without being asked--exactly what mass ratio, nozzle diameter and\r\npropulsive velocity would be needed for the first trip to the Moon. He\r\nknew how many hours a round trip would take, both for landing there or\r\nmerely circling the body of the satellite.\r\n\r\nHe had the courses to Mars and Venus thoroughly charted--but considered\r\na trip to Jupiter somewhat impractical. So, what with Dane\'s presence\r\nand the mysterious white streaks that so often shot up into the sky like\r\nfuzzy yarn from the AFDC base, it wasn\'t hard to guess what was going\r\non.\r\n\r\nNevertheless Professor Dane was surprised and somewhat offended when the\r\nyoung man from the Federal Bureau of Investigation came to call on him\r\none afternoon. And the worst part of it was that the young man didn\'t\r\nhave much sense of humor.\r\n\r\n"As you know, sir," the young man said, "we\'ve been sighting and\r\ntracking these unidentified objects in the sky. You must have read about\r\nthose they chased near Atlanta yesterday."\r\n\r\n"Ah," said Professor Dane. "Martian through Georgia, no doubt."\r\n\r\nThe young man stared at him blankly. He seemed to Professor Dane one of\r\nthe most nondescript young men his eyes had ever beheld. He had a\r\nclean-shaven, pleasant face without exactly being handsome and his eyes\r\nwere sincere and mild. He wore a neat gray tropical worsted suit and an\r\nunobtrusive tie. 

He was about thirty. Professor Dane supposed that all\r\nthis was an advantage in his profession.\r\n\r\nThe young man went on--earnestly. "Without forming any theories about\r\nthese things we\'ve been asked to take certain precautions. I don\'t know\r\nwhether they suspect a hostile power, or what. That\'s not my job. At any\r\nrate I\'ve been given the responsibility of instituting certain security\r\ntechniques. You do after all, sir, have access to and knowledge of\r\nconsiderable classified information."\r\n\r\nThis lad reminded him somewhat of his old friend and colleague, Dr.\r\nFincher, out in California. Wally Fincher was a well-known physicist\r\nnow, though how anyone ever managed to struggle through his dry\r\nponderous books Dane didn\'t know. Probably he had gained most of his\r\nfame through his part in those experiments where they bounced radar\r\nblips off the moon, Dane thought.\r\n\r\nWally always talked in long unnecessary words. He never merely "went"\r\nwhen he could "proceed," he never simply "used" when it was possible to\r\n"utilize," he didn\'t "get things done"--he "implemented" them. Professor\r\nDane made a mental note to put in a long distance call to Wally that\r\nevening and tweak his nose a bit. Maybe Dane could pretend he was the\r\nFBI--disguise his voice and interrogate Wally, as though he were\r\ninvestigating him. He chuckled a little at the idea. Then he realized\r\nthat the young man had been talking and he hadn\'t been listening.\r\n\r\n"... so among other things, sir, we thought it best to monitor your\r\nofficial mail and hope you won\'t mind."\r\n\r\n"What?" said Dane, raising his eyebrows.\r\n\r\n"_And_ your phone. You\'ll hear a couple of clicks whenever you use it.\r\nWe\'re recording what\'s said over it--though I assure you all records\r\nobtained will be kept in strictest confidence."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDane acquiesced. The young man finally managed to make it clear that all\r\nthis surveillance would have to be with Dane\'s permission and the\r\nprofessor, annoyed though he was, didn\'t want to appear uncooperative.\r\nHe couldn\'t resist, however, giving the young man the wrong hat when he\r\nwent out and being delighted when the young man came back for the right\r\none five minutes later. He was glad to see that something could fluster\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nBut that wasn\'t really enough. Professor Dane had been annoyed, and he\r\nneeded to express himself further--by means of the joke, which was his\r\nart--in order to regain some measure of his equilibrium and\r\nself-respect.\r\n\r\nInspiration visited him as he was climbing the stairs to his bedroom at\r\nten-thirty that evening. He stopped short, thought a minute, then began\r\nto chuckle. He turned and went downstairs again, stepped to the phone.\r\nProfessor Dane lived alone and no one else would be able to share his\r\nplanned joke--but this didn\'t matter.\r\n\r\nHe had been privately enjoying his pranks ever since, as a frail boy\r\nwith an unreasonable and dominating male parent, he had discovered that\r\nthey were one way in which he could compete with hardier souls, at times\r\neven surpass them. Never mind the audience, he thought. 

The jest was the\r\nthing!\r\n\r\nIt was an hour earlier in Los Angeles and Dr. Wallace Fincher was at\r\nhome. Dane disguised his voice--he did a lot of University Theater work\r\nand this kind of thing came to him easily. He listened first to Dr.\r\nFincher\'s arid, humorless, "Hello. Dr. 

Fincher speaking." Then he heard\r\nthe preliminary clicking, just as the FBI man had predicted.\r\n\r\n"Thandor," said Professor Dane, "this is Klon calling."\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon?" 

said Doctor Fincher.\r\n\r\n"The jig\'s up," said Professor Dane. "Captain Ixl in propul-cruiser\r\nnine-nine-seven-three will never be able to break through. The\r\nEarthlings have set up a close watch--they\'re suspicious.

"\r\n\r\n"Who is this?" Doctor Fincher sounded startled. "Who the devil is this\r\ncalling?"\r\n\r\nDane could barely keep his laughter from breaking into his voice.\r\n"Thandor, we can come to no conclusion but that the Terrestrials are\r\ndefinitely hostile. We should have expected that from their primitive\r\nstage of development. 

They have orders to shoot any of our\r\npropul-cruisers they can catch. I suggest that we withdraw all ships of\r\nthe Franistan class immediately from their free orbits and send them on\r\na standard Keplerian course to the home planet for further\r\nconsultation."\r\n\r\n"_Is this some kind of joke?_" Fincher sounded as if he were almost\r\npanicky.\r\n\r\n"Furthermore," said Dane, "I recommend that we withdraw all agents from\r\nEarth. We can\'t conceal our superior mental development and advanced\r\ntechnology much longer.\r\n\r\n"Someone\'s bound to catch on pretty soon. I was against this plan in the\r\nGalactic Council in the first place, you\'ll remember. Well, farewell,\r\nThandor! 

I\'ll be seeing you soon in space!"\r\n\r\nAnd Professor Dane hung up before he exploded with laughter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe laughed until the tears came to his eyes. He held his stomach with\r\nboth hands. 

He was weak. He supported himself on the stair railing and\r\nfor minutes was unable to take the first tread. With his lively\r\nscientist\'s imagination he could picture the completely bewildered look\r\non the young FBI man\'s face when he listened to this conversation on the\r\ntape recorder or whatever it was they used.\r\n\r\nHe was certainly going to have to try to get that recording from them.\r\nPlay it back for Fincher some time--Lordy, Fincher would have apoplexy\r\nevery time he heard it!\r\n\r\nHe finally gained enough strength to climb the stairs. He went into his\r\nbedroom, still chuckling weakly, still wiping the tears from his eyes,\r\nstomach muscles still aching.\r\n\r\nDr. Wallace Fincher stood there by his bed. It _was_ Fincher--the same\r\nstocky round-faced man with the steel-rimmed glasses he had always\r\nknown. It was either Fincher or the darndest hallucination he had\r\never ...\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry, Lyman," said Dr. Fincher in a kindly but impersonal voice.\r\n"You were getting a trifle too close. I\'m afraid you have left me no\r\nchoice."\r\n\r\nHe pointed a little silvery tube at Professor Dane and there was a soft\r\nbuzzing and the smell of ozone and Professor Dane was no longer in the\r\nroom--or anywhere else.\r\n\r\nDr. Fincher sighed, adjusted his glasses and faded into the dimension\r\nthat would take him back to Los Angeles and his interrupted work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ Aug-Sept 1953.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

Tau was\r\n           electrical. Yet Tau could face death like a man.\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n                      Planet Stories Summer 1948.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nA gleaming binary swung in the blue sky, sending a moist warmth\r\nacross the swaying fern-growths of the _Fourteenth Planet_. 

Feathered\r\ncreatures of bright colors flashed through the underbrush and made\r\nnoises there. A figure came stalking down through the shaded clearings,\r\nand small scaly bodies scurried out of sight, leaving ungainly tracks\r\nscrawled in the swamp mud.\r\n\r\nTau, the metal man, a mechanical half-sentient messenger from the\r\nfar distant past, strode impassively along, not heeding the smaller\r\ncreatures of the jungle. He had sighted the tiny habitable world from\r\nthe distant depths of an outer galaxy, and had moored his space-ship in\r\na clearing that was not distant.\r\n\r\nHe halted his berylite six-foot body in a leafy glade and let the wind\r\nplay about his cold outer surface. 

The lens-cased inscrutable orbs in\r\nhis head peered about, taking in the scene with photographic detail.\r\n\r\n"Life! This is life!" 

he thought to himself. 

"This is the life the\r\nMaster said I would find some day."\r\n\r\nThough his memories were of a distant past, of a remote planet, and\r\nof the Master whose atoms might lie even now in the etheric dust, Tau\r\nremembered with perfect clarity. He could recall the aged countenance\r\nof the Master, the broad forehead, the jutting chin, and the determined\r\nundertone of his deep voice.\r\n\r\n"Men may die," the Master had said, "but their deeds live after them."\r\nAnd Kendall Smith\'s face had lighted inwardly as though from some deep\r\ninspiration. Tau had said nothing in reply, but in the neurochemical\r\nmechanisms of his brain the words had been imprinted forever.\r\n\r\n"You\'re just a robot," the master had said, "with responses and\r\nreactions that are the involuntary activations of metal and\r\nchemical-change impulse, yet I believe that some day in the aeons which\r\nwill pass, you will learn to reason for yourself to some extent, and\r\nperhaps understand your mission. But you will never live, even though\r\nyou may carry the germs of life into the far distant future."\r\n\r\nAnd now Tau, standing in the mire of that world of the future he had\r\ntalked about, wondered at the mystery which was called Life, and\r\ndoubted if he clearly understood what the Master had meant. One thing\r\nhe knew certainly, that his metallic body was meant to bridge the\r\nepoch which yawned between the life-lines of the past and those of the\r\nfuture. Old Kendall Smith, stalking back and forth in his laboratory,\r\nhad explained as much, and Tau had never forgotten.\r\n\r\n"Our life-line is narrowing, the earth is dying," the Master had\r\nexplained. "That one-in-a-million chance of opportune conditions in\r\nwhich life may exist is vanishing. I doubt if the circumstances can be\r\nduplicated in the entire universe. 

But someday, by the very laws which\r\ngovern chance, they must return again. It is not within the powers\r\nof man to bridge the gap of space and time, but you, Tau, the robot,\r\nswinging in the non-conducting realms of the vacuum of space, will be\r\nnext to eternal."\r\n\r\nTau had learned the secrets of extracting radiant energy from the\r\natom, had become adept in applying the forces to the mechanisms that\r\npropelled the space-ship and supplied motivation for his own metal\r\nbody. Many other secrets the Master had taught him in the laboratories,\r\nand he had come to know the uses of the scientific paraphernalia that\r\nwas sealed in the inner heart of the space-craft. When the occasion\r\ncame for Tau to use the equipment, Kendall Smith had said, he would\r\nunderstand the true nature constituting life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe binary descended, and night fell. Glittering shards of the stars\r\npierced the black firmament. Night creatures let out occasional shrieks\r\nand snarls. Once a six-legged catlike creature, half as tall as the\r\nmetal man, was attracted by Tau\'s movements, and sprang upon him. Tau\'s\r\nresponses were mechanical, and he knew no such thing as fear. He simply\r\nripped the creature apart with the tremendous strength that surged in\r\nhis metal arms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Tau tore him to pieces._]\r\n\r\nLater that night he returned to the space-ship. As he approached the\r\ngleaming ovoid a circular door opened. Crossing its threshold, he\r\npassed into the interior, distorted by intricate mechanisms, and the\r\naperture closed behind him.\r\n\r\nSlowly Tau walked to the center of the room, his body reflected in\r\ngleaming surfaces of berylite stanchions and sheathings. In the center\r\nof the whorled contrivances a row of ingenious troughs lay exposed.\r\nEach of these troughs was centered by a molding that had the perfect\r\noutline of a man, empty in the crystalline interior.\r\n\r\nAll that night iridescent gleamings crawled along the monstrous\r\nglassite tubes, illuminating the busy robot with an eerie splendor.\r\nMiniature lightning shot and sparkled from insulated spheres high in\r\nthe nose of the craft. Pulsating, sluggish liquids gave off radiant\r\ncolors and seeped through tortuous channels along the tubes of\r\nglassite. The central troughs became opaque, and formed a webwork\r\nnow into which the throbbing aqueous masses were assembling. A chill\r\ncurrent of the outer atmosphere was forced by rotating blades along a\r\nchannel that whirled in a maelstrom around the central apparatus.\r\n\r\nTau worked swiftly, but days fled by as he watched the quiescent gauges\r\nand indicators, lengthened into months. Blinding storms raged unheeded\r\non the exterior of the ovoid craft. Winter came and fled.\r\n\r\nAt last David and his tribe came to life, all molded from a magnificent\r\nscale. During those long months of creation, Tau had imprinted\r\nknowledge and learning upon the brains of the dormant bodies. Each\r\nawoke with a full knowledge of what had transpired on the dying planet\r\nof earth, and each knew that a strange new-born world awaited them. The\r\nlargest and most magnificent man was named David. The Master had been\r\ncareful in instructing Tau about that. Kendall Smith had never had a\r\nson. And this synthetic offspring in a distant life-line of the cosmos\r\nwould be almost like a son for him.\r\n\r\nAll of Tau\'s knowledges were conveyed to David and his followers, and\r\nhe led them into the unknown dangers of the pristine jungled planet,\r\nguarding them from the ferocious animals while they learned the edible\r\nfruits from the poisonous ones. Gradually David\'s men came to recognize\r\nthe dangers and constructed weapons for their own defense.\r\n\r\nAnother winter descended upon the new world. Food had been stored in\r\nthe big compartment of the space vessel. Furs of slain animals had been\r\ncured to provide clothing and warmth.\r\n\r\nSpring thaws came and Tau led them again into the jungle, but now David\r\nwas big and strong and wary, quite able to defend himself against the\r\ndangers of the forest, and Tau\'s presence was hardly needed, though he\r\nalways hovered near.\r\n\r\nFive men and five women had been given life by Tau\'s instruments, and\r\nit was inevitable that a gradual pairing off would take place. Myri, a\r\nmodel of womanly perfection, had grown to adore the handsome leader of\r\nthe tribe, and Tau was one of the first to notice signs of fecundity.\r\n\r\nA terrific storm lashed the planet. Giant trees groaned and split\r\nacross the trunks. The raging downpour built up into outer floods that\r\nraged down the lowlands in mighty rivers, sweeping everything in its\r\npath to destruction. Of all this Tau was oblivious. The fury of the\r\ntempest was deadened by the berylite walls of the space-ship, and not\r\nas loud as the shrill cry of the new-born babe.\r\n\r\nThunder boomed outside. 

Lightning forked across the rent heavens,\r\nsending flickering flashes of illumination through the beating sheets\r\nof rain that poured across the glassite sheathing above the neglected\r\ncontrol mechanisms. David the second was born, and for a brief time was\r\ncuddled against the breast of the metal man, whose terribly strong arms\r\nof metal held him as lightly and delicately as could a bed of thistle\r\ndown. The imperturbable orbs of immobile transparency gazed downward,\r\nand suddenly Tau staggered.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDavid took the child with a startled cry and stood eyeing the tottering\r\nrobot. Tau\'s consciousness was centered upon his dragging limbs and\r\nfor a moment his mentality flickered as though it were gone, then\r\nreturned. He saw that his metallic body was dark and stained with an\r\nodd encrustation, and he turned and made his way to the cubicle in\r\nwhich he had sat while an aeon of time slipped away in the depths of\r\ninterplanetary space, and the life-line of one aeon had merged with\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThere was one hooded mechanism at which he always sat, and when he was\r\njust so, the mind of the Master would speak from down the ages, and the\r\nimage of Kendall Smith arose, as it had always done, in his mind. He\r\nthought he visualized the Master now, out of the dim consciousness of\r\nthe past. Tall and arresting with the vigorous personality of a dynamic\r\nintelligence, the keen grey eyes peered at him again, as they had done\r\nin the distant past.\r\n\r\n"You, Tau, are just a man of metal," the Master was saying "and yet\r\nI\'ve a feeling that part of myself is implanted within you just as part\r\nof my mind is implanted into the mechanisms of your consciousness. As\r\na thing of metal, floating in a non-conducting void, you are something\r\nthat is almost eternal. Yet if you succeed in finding a habitable\r\nworld, such as the earth has been in the past, the atmosphere of that\r\nplanet will suffuse about you, and in the triumph of my wishes will lie\r\nyour downfall. Oxides of the surrounding air will cause your gradual\r\ndeterioration, and the only one who could help you will be nothing\r\nmore than motes of cosmic dust in the unpredictable corners of the\r\nsurrounding universe."\r\n\r\nUnseen by David or any of the others, Tau slipped to the door and down\r\na corridorway. Through an aperture he could glimpse the inner room\r\nwhere Myri lay, nursing the infant at her breast. For just an instant\r\nhe paused, for the Master had never seemed closer than in that single\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nTurning finally, the metal man walked impassionately through the\r\ndoorway and vanished into the driving blasts of the lashing storm.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


"\r\n\r\nThey glowered at each other. Then Les rubbed her cheek with the back of\r\nhis hand, and smiled.\r\n\r\n"Thanks, kid," he said. "You really had me going for a minute. 

Now I\r\nfeel better!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPleased with the compliment, Janet concocted an extra-fancy combination\r\nof films to spray on herself for the morning\'s wear. When it was\r\nin place, she ordered a large breakfast and arranged to have the\r\nwaiter-doll do a special dance-routine while serving.\r\n\r\nBut Les\'s smile had vanished with the whiskers he\'d rubbed off. He\r\npicked at his food, turned his back on the dancing, and afterward\r\nyawned away the few minutes they spent on their apartment\'s terrace,\r\nstared at by fifty thousand neighbors who lacked anything better to do.\r\nWhen Les wandered idly off, Janet followed.\r\n\r\nLes went to the living room, projected a book onto the ceiling,\r\nswitched it off without reading, played with the glowing phosphors\r\nthat lighted the room in colors he varied jarringly, fiddled with the\r\nconsole of the perfume aerosol and created a stink, and then, in sheer\r\ndespair, turned on the puppet-set.\r\n\r\nIts lighted screen listed the necessary dolls and props, so he laid\r\nthem out. Soon the three-foot stage reflected a broadcast picture of\r\nthe State Executive Office. A stringless, formally-dressed puppet sat\r\nat a desk, its blank face a transmitted facsimile of the Governor\'s.\r\n\r\n"... the last time I can make this announcement," the Governor was\r\nsaying into a hidden microphone. "The tests are to begin at noon. Jobs\r\nare now open! I repeat: jobs are now open! Men only, of course. But if\r\nany of you fellows out there suffer from boredom--and who doesn\'t in\r\nthis wonderful State of ours that by virtue of the New Energy-Sources\r\nguarantees leisured security to each citizen--if, I repeat, you suffer\r\nfrom ennui, then why not apply for a job?\r\n\r\n"Do it now--no further vacancies will occur for years, and we have some\r\nreally desirable positions open this morning. Appointments will be made\r\nstrictly on merit, as usual, with a job for every applicant and the\r\nbest job for the top man.\r\n\r\n"Though it\'s true that losers in this competition are required to\r\nassume for life the less desirable duties that our civilization\r\nimposes, I assure you that isn\'t as bad as it sounds. I was pretty far\r\ndown the list in my day, yet I only have to be Governor....\r\n\r\n"So won\'t you please apply? I want a _lot_ of competition!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe stage darkened, and the puppet got up and walked to its box. Before\r\nthe lights could go up on the next program, Les switched the set off.\r\n\r\n"What do you think?" he asked Janet.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," she said. "Nobody in _my_ family has ever worked."\r\n\r\n"Mine, either. But I once knew a fellow who\'d tried for a job. He\r\nseemed o.k. 

to me, but he sure didn\'t get a good one! Had a clerical\r\nposition, with business machines, and their output was geared down\r\nto spread the work. So he didn\'t have enough to do ... just stacked\r\npunched cards or something every day for eighty years!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, you\'d do better than that, dear!"\r\n\r\n"Maybe. Point is, there _are_ jobs worse than no job at all!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not so sure!" Janet said, suddenly determined. "Only a few minutes\r\nago you weren\'t very happy about the idle days ahead. Why not take a\r\nchance?

"\r\n\r\n"Take a chance? What kind of language is that? Chance went out along\r\nwith disease and poverty and crime and accidents. You\'re way off base,\r\nJan!

"\r\n\r\n"But you have a chance--oh, all right!--an opportunity, then, if you\r\nlike that better, to get a _good_ job. Now, if I were a man--"\r\n\r\n"But you\'re not.... Still ... maybe I\'ll try it...."\r\n\r\nFor the first time in a month or two, Janet kissed him warmly. And\r\nafter she\'d helped him into his wings and seen him off from the\r\nterrace, she felt a strange warm glow of anticipation. Not since she\'d\r\nmarried had there been need for a decision that could bring change into\r\nher life. This was a Day!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was a Day for a lot of others, too. She learned that from the noon\r\nbroadcast of the test ceremony.\r\n\r\n"In my time," the Governor said, speaking from the Capitol\'s rotunda,\r\n"in my time a hundred aspirants was considered a good turnout. Today\'s\r\napplicants total a thousand! We haven\'t actually got a thousand jobs\r\nlined up, but we\'ll get \'em! And I\'m privileged to announce, now that\r\nthe list of competitors has closed, that we do have the astoundingly\r\nlarge number of ten--repeat, ten--genuinely desirable appointments to\r\nmake."\r\n\r\nTen good jobs for a thousand applicants didn\'t sound to Janet\r\nlike an astoundingly large number. She\'d been sprawled on a\r\nmagnetically-positioned pad half-way between floor and ceiling, but\r\nshe sat up when the Governor stopped talking, and with a twinge of\r\ngenuine and unwonted anxiety watched the long file of applicants as\r\nthey approached in turn the brain-wave analyzer, the voice-operated\r\nsorter that would add their life-files to current test results, and the\r\nofficials who judged each man\'s configuration.\r\n\r\nShe wished they\'d announce the test results publicly, but knew they\r\nwouldn\'t. So, when Les had gone through--about twenty minutes after the\r\nstart--Janet shut off the broadcast, dissolved her dress-films, and\r\nhad herself rubbed by the massage machine. The morning\'s suspense was\r\nproving too much for her, and she didn\'t want to have a headache when\r\nLes came home.\r\n\r\nBut even the mechanical masseuse couldn\'t rub away her strange\r\nfeelings. Not since marriage had Janet felt curiosity as to the future.\r\n\r\nWhat if he got so dull they never even argued about anything? She\r\nshivered at the thought--but then she smiled. And for the next hour\r\nJanet lay under the soothing massage and gave herself up to the\r\ndelightful new pleasure of worrying.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Les returned, shadowing the terrace in his descent like some\r\nportentous bird, Janet began to shake. Without even waiting to kiss\r\nhim, she said, "How was it? 

How did you do?

"\r\n\r\nLes grinned teasingly. "Help me moult, first," he said. "I\'m tired."\r\n\r\nUnable to get anything else out of him until it was done, she tore\r\nhis wings off damagingly, kissed him, and said, "_Now_ won\'t you say\r\nsomething?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m hungry!"\r\n\r\n"No!" She danced her impatience like a little girl. "Tell me!"\r\n\r\nBut even as she pouted, her eyes sparkled in anticipation.\r\n\r\n"I start tomorrow," he said.\r\n\r\n"Did you get the best job?"\r\n\r\n"Nope. No, I really didn\'t.

"\r\n\r\n"What, then?"\r\n\r\n"Second best!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, wonderful! 

What is it?"\r\n\r\n"Rigger and high-climber--topping trees, setting structural iron,\r\nfixing flag-poles--that sort of thing. Powderman was first."\r\n\r\n"Oh, rigger\'s wonderful!" Visions of his future work flashed across her\r\nmind, implanted there by childhood hours spent watching other members\r\nof this elite profession at their thrilling work. She knew there could\r\nbe broken cables, falling pulleys, snapped booms, dropped loads--every\r\nday would have its interesting possibilities!\r\n\r\n"My darling!" She threw her arms around him and was momentarily\r\nsilenced by his kiss.\r\n\r\nThen she stepped back, looked admiringly up at him, and said, "Oh, I\'m\r\nso happy for you! And so proud! 

I\'m going right in and order up a nice\r\nbig meal. 

I know you\'ll enjoy this one--it really _might_ be your last!"\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\n    _They say the Lion and the\r\n      Lizard keep\r\n    The Courts where Jamshyd\r\n      gloried and drank deep_--\r\n\r\n    --_The Rub\xc3\xa1iy\xc3\xa1t_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dust-reddened sun was low in the west when the tribe filed down\r\nfrom the fissured foothills to the sea. The women spread out along the\r\nbeach to gather driftwood, while the men took over the task of setting\r\nup the rain-catch.\r\n\r\nRyan could tell from the haggard faces around him that there would\r\nbe a dance that night. He knew his own face must be haggard too,\r\nhaggard and grimed with dust, the cheeks caved in, the eyes dark with\r\nhunger-shadows. The dogless days had been many this time.\r\n\r\nThe rain-catch was a crazy quiltwork pattern of dogskins laboriously\r\nsewn together into a makeshift tarpaulin. Ryan and the other young men\r\nheld it aloft while the older men set up the poles and tied the dog-gut\r\nstrings, letting the tarp sag in the middle so that when it rained the\r\nprecious water would accumulate in the depression. When the job was\r\ndone, the men went down to the beach and stood around the big fire the\r\nwomen had built.\r\n\r\nRyan\'s legs ached from the long trek through the hill country and his\r\nshoulders were sore from packing the dogskin tarp over the last five\r\nmiles. Sometimes he wished he was the oldest man in the tribe instead\r\nof the youngest: then he would be free from the heavy work, free to\r\nshamble along in the rear on marches; free to sit on his haunches\r\nduring stopovers while the younger men took care of the hunting and the\r\nlove-making.\r\n\r\nHe stood with his back to the fire, letting the heat penetrate his\r\ndogskin clothing and warm his flesh. Nearby, the women were preparing\r\nthe evening meal, mashing the day\'s harvest of tubers into a thick\r\npulp, adding water sparingly from their dogskin waterbags. Ryan\r\nglimpsed Merium out of the corner of his eye, but the sight of her\r\nthin young face and shapely body did not stir his blood at all, and he\r\nturned his eyes miserably away.\r\n\r\nHe remembered how he had felt about her at the time of the last dog\r\nkill--how he had lain beside her before the roaring fire, the aroma\r\nof roasted dog flesh still lingering in the night air. His belly had\r\nbeen full and he had lain beside her half the night, and he had almost\r\nwanted her. She had seemed beautiful then, and for many days afterward;\r\nbut gradually her beauty had faded away and she had become just another\r\ndrab face, another listless figure stumbling along with the rest of the\r\ntribe, from oasis to oasis, from ruin to ruin, in the eternal search\r\nfor food.\r\n\r\nRyan shook his head. He could not understand it. 

But there were so\r\nmany things that he could not understand. The Dance, for instance. Why\r\nshould the mouthing of mere words to the accompaniment of rhythmic\r\nmovements give him pleasure? How could hatred make him strong?\r\n\r\nHe shook his head again. In a way, the Dance was the biggest mystery of\r\nall....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMerium brought him his supper, looking up at him shyly with her large\r\nbrown eyes. Illogically, Ryan was reminded of the last dog he had\r\nkilled and he jerked the earthen pot out of her hands and walked down\r\nto the water\'s edge to eat alone.\r\n\r\nThe sun had set. Streaks of gold and crimson quivered in the\r\nwind-creased water, slowly faded away. Darkness crept down from the\r\ngullied foothills to the beach, and with it came the first cold breath\r\nof night.\r\n\r\nRyan shivered. He tried to concentrate on his food, but the memory of\r\nthe dog would not go away.\r\n\r\nIt had been a small dog, but a very vicious one. It had bared its teeth\r\nwhen at last he had cornered it in the little rocky cul-de-sac in the\r\nmountains, and as further evidence of its viciousness, it had wagged\r\nits ridiculous tail. Ryan could still remember the high-pitched sound\r\nof its growl--or was it a whine?--when he advanced on it with his club;\r\nbut most of all he remembered the way its eyes had been when he brought\r\nthe club down on its head.\r\n\r\nHe tried to free himself from the memory, tried to enjoy his tasteless\r\nmeal. But he went right on remembering. He remembered all the other\r\ndogs he had killed and he wondered why killing them should bother him\r\nso. Once, he knew, dogs had run with the hunters, not from them; but\r\nthat was long before his time--when there had been something else\r\nbesides dogs to hunt.\r\n\r\nNow it was different. Now it was dogs--or death....\r\n\r\nHe finished his meatless stew, swallowing the last mouthful grimly. He\r\nheard a soft step behind him, but he did not turn around. Presently\r\nMerium sat down beside him.\r\n\r\nThe sea glinted palely in the light of the first stars.\r\n\r\n"It\'s beautiful tonight," Merium said.\r\n\r\nRyan was silent.\r\n\r\n"Will there be a dance?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Maybe.

"\r\n\r\n"I hope there is."\r\n\r\n"Why?

"\r\n\r\n"I--I don\'t know. Because everyone\'s so different afterwards, I\r\nsuppose--so happy, almost."\r\n\r\nRyan looked at her. Starlight lay gently on her child-like face, hiding\r\nthe thinness of her cheeks, softening the hunger-shadows beneath her\r\neyes. Again he remembered the night he had almost wanted her and he\r\nwanted it to be the same again, only all the way this time. He wanted\r\nto want to take her in his arms and kiss her lips and hold her tightly\r\nto him, and when desire refused to rise in him, shame took its place,\r\nand because he couldn\'t understand the shame, he supplanted it with\r\nanger.\r\n\r\n"Men have no happiness!" he said savagely.\r\n\r\n"They did once--a long time ago.

"\r\n\r\n"You listen too much to the old women\'s tales."\r\n\r\n"I like to listen to them. I like to hear of the time when the ruins\r\nwere living cities and the earth was green--when there was an abundance\r\nof food and water for everyone.... Surely you believe there was such a\r\ntime. The words of the Dance--"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," Ryan said. "Sometimes I think the words of the Dance\r\nare lies."\r\n\r\nMerium shook her head. "No. The words of the Dance are wisdom. Without\r\nthem we could not live."\r\n\r\n"You talk like an old woman yourself!" Ryan said. Abruptly he stood up.\r\n"You _are_ an old woman. 

An ugly old woman!" He strode across the sand\r\nto the fire, leaving her alone by the water.\r\n\r\nThe tribe had broken up into groups. The old men huddled together in\r\none group, the younger men in another. The women sat by themselves near\r\nthe wavering perimeter of the firelight, crooning an ancient melody,\r\nexchanging an occasional word in low tones.\r\n\r\nRyan stood by the fire alone. He was the youngest male of the tribe.\r\nHe and Merium had been the last children to be born. The tribe had\r\nnumbered in the hundreds then, and the hunting had been good, the dogs\r\nstill tame and easy to find. There had been other tribes too, wandering\r\nover the dust-veiled land. Ryan wondered what had become of them. 

But\r\nhe only pretended to wonder. In his heart, he knew.\r\n\r\nIt was growing colder. He added more driftwood to the fire and watched\r\nthe flames gorge themselves. Flames were like men, he thought. They ate\r\neverything there was in sight, and when there was nothing more to eat,\r\nthey died.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuddenly a drum throbbed out and a woman\'s voice chanted: "What is a\r\ntree?"\r\n\r\nA voice answered from the group of old men: "A tree is a green dream."\r\n\r\n"What has become of the living land?

"\r\n\r\n"The living land is dust!"\r\n\r\nThe drum beat grew louder. Ryan\'s throat tightened. He felt the\r\nrefreshing warmth of anger touch his face. The opening phase of the\r\nDance always affected him, even when he was expecting it.\r\n\r\nOne of the old men was moving out into the firelight, shuffling his\r\nfeet to the beat of the drum. The light reddened the wrinkles on his\r\nthirty-year-old face, made a crimson washboard of his forehead. His\r\nthin voice drifted on the cold night air:\r\n\r\n    "_The living land is dust, and those\r\n    who turned it into dust\r\n    are dust themselves_--"\r\n\r\nA woman\'s voice took up the chant:\r\n\r\n    "_Our ancestors are dust:\r\n    dust are our gorged ancestors_--"\r\n\r\nThere were other figures shuffling in the firelight now, and the\r\nbeat on the dogskin drum head was sharper, stronger. Ryan felt the\r\nquickening of his blood, the surge of new-born energy.\r\n\r\nVoices blended:\r\n\r\n    "_Dust are our gorged ancestors,\r\n    our ancestors who raped the\r\n      fields and ravished the hills,\r\n    who cut the forest chains and\r\n      set the rivers free;\r\n    our ancestors who drank deep\r\n      from the well of the world\r\n    and left the well dry_--"\r\n\r\nRyan could contain himself no longer. He felt his own feet moving with\r\nthe vindictive beat of the drum. He heard his own voice take up the\r\nchant:\r\n\r\n    "_Let us take the memory of our ancestors\r\n    and tear it open, rend its vitals,\r\n    throw its entrails on the fire:\r\n    our ancestors, the eaters,\r\n    the putrefiers of the lakes and the rivers;\r\n    the consumers, the destroyers, the murderers of the living land;\r\n    the selfish, the obese, the great collectors,\r\n    who tried to devour the world_--"\r\n\r\nHe joined the stomping mass of the tribe, his hands going through the\r\nmimic motions of killing, rending, throwing. Strength flowed into his\r\nemaciated limbs, pulsed through his undernourished body. He glimpsed\r\nMerium across the fire and he caught his breath at the beauty of her\r\nanimated face. Again he almost wanted her, and for a while he was able\r\nto convince himself that some day he _would_ want her; that this time\r\nthe effect of the Dance would not wear off the way it always had\r\nbefore and he would go on feeling strong and confident and unafraid and\r\nfind many dogs to feed the tribe; then, perhaps, the men would want the\r\nwomen the way they used to, and he would want Merium, and the tribe\r\nwould increase and become great and strong--\r\n\r\nHe raised his voice higher and stomped his feet as hard as he could.\r\nThe hatred was like wine now, gushing hotly through his body, throbbing\r\nwildly in his brain. The chant crescendoed into a huge hysterical wail,\r\na bitter accusation reverberating over the barren hills and the dead\r\nsea, riding the dust-laden wind--\r\n\r\n    "_Our ancestors were pigs!\r\n    Our ancestors were pigs!..._"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


"\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Professor," Gloria simpered. "I made them myself."\r\n\r\n"You must give us the recipe," said one of the ladies--and the others\r\nmurmured agreement, glad to get their individualities on a plane they\r\ncould understand.\r\n\r\n"Since most decisions are hardly as momentous as the individual\r\nimagines," Professor Falabella continued, "and since the imagination of\r\nthe average individual is very limited, many of these different\r\nplanes--or, as they are colloquially known, space-time continuums--may\r\nexist in close, even tangential relationship."\r\n\r\nGloria rose unobtrusively and took the teapot to the kitchen for a\r\nrefill. Her husband stood by the sink moodily drinking whiskey out of\r\nthe bottle so as to avoid having to wash a glass afterward.\r\n\r\n"Bill, you\'re not being polite to our guests. Why don\'t you go out and\r\nlisten to Professor Falabella?"\r\n\r\n"I can hear him perfectly well from here," Bill muttered--and indeed the\r\nprofessor\'s mellifluous tones pervaded every nook and cranny of the\r\nthin-walled house. "Long-winded cultist! What is he a professor of, I\'d\r\nlike to know."\r\n\r\n"Professor Falabella is _not_ a cultist!" affirmed Gloria angrily. "He\'s\r\na great philosopher."\r\n\r\nBill Hughes said something unprintable. "If I\'d married Lucy Allison,"\r\nhe continued unkindly, "she\'d never have filled the house with\r\nlong-haired cultists on my so-called day of rest."\r\n\r\nGloria\'s soft chin trembled, and her blue eyes filled with tears. She\r\nwas beginning to put on weight, he noticed. "I\'ve been hearing nothing\r\nbut Lucy Allison, Lucy Allison, Lucy Allison for the past year. Y-you\r\nsaid yourself she looked like a horse.

"\r\n\r\n"Horses," he observed, "have sense."\r\n\r\nHe was being brutal, but he couldn\'t help it and didn\'t want to.\r\nProfessor Falabella was only the most long-winded of a long series of\r\nmystics Gloria was forever dragging into the house. _The trouble with\r\nthe half-educated_, he thought bitterly, _is that they seek culture in\r\nthe most peculiar places_.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll bet she would have let me have peace on Sunday," he said. "It just\r\ngoes to show what happens when you marry a woman solely for her looks."\r\nHe drained the bottle; then hurled it into the garbage pail with a\r\nresounding crash.\r\n\r\nGloria\'s shoulders shook as she filled the kettle. "I wish I\'d decided\r\nto be an old maid," she sobbed.\r\n\r\nA very unlikely possibility, he thought. Even now, shopworn as she was,\r\nGloria could have a fairly wide range of suitors should something happen\r\nto him. She looked sexy, but how deceiving appearances could be!\r\n\r\nProfessor Falabella was still talking as Bill and Gloria emerged from\r\nthe kitchen. "I believe that it is possible for an individual who exists\r\non a limited plane of imagination to transpose from one plane to an\r\nadjacent one without difficulty ... Great Heavens, what was that?"\r\n\r\nSomething had whisked past the archway leading into the foyer.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t pay any attention," Gloria smiled nervously. "The house is\r\nhaunted."\r\n\r\n"My dear," one of the ladies offered, "I know of the most marvelous\r\nexterminator--"\r\n\r\n"The house," Gloria assured her coldly, "really _is_ haunted. We\'ve been\r\nseeing things ever since we moved in."\r\n\r\nAnd she really believed it, Bill thought. Believed that the house was\r\nhaunted, that is. Of course he had seen things too--but he was\r\nenlightened enough to know that ghosts don\'t exist, even if you do see\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nProfessor Falabella cleared his throat. "As I was saying, it is possible\r\nto send the individual through another--well, dimension, as some popular\r\nwriters would have it, to one of his other spatial existences on the\r\nsame temporal plane. It is merely necessary for him to find the Door."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense!" Bill interrupted. "Holy, unmitigated nonsense!"\r\n\r\nEvery head swivelled to look at him. Gloria restrained tears with an\r\neffort.\r\n\r\n"Brute," someone muttered.\r\n\r\nBut ridicule apparently only stimulated the professor. He beamed. 

"You\r\ndon\'t believe me. Your imagination cannot extend to the comprehension of\r\nthe multifariousness of space."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense," Bill said again, but less confidently.\r\n\r\n"I believe that I have discovered the Doorway," Professor Falabella\r\ncontinued, "and the Way is Open. However, most people fear to penetrate\r\nthe unknown, even though it is to enter another phase of their own\r\nexistence. I do admit that the shock of spatial transference, no matter\r\nhow slight, combined with the concrete awareness of a previous spatial\r\nrelationship would be perhaps too much for the keenly sensitive\r\nindividualism ..."\r\n\r\nBill opened his mouth.\r\n\r\n"I know what you\'re about to say, young man!"\r\n\r\n"You don\'t have to be a mind reader to know that," Bill assured him. His\r\nconsonants were already a little slurred and he knew Gloria was ashamed\r\nof him. It served her right. He\'d been ashamed of her for years.\r\n\r\nProfessor Falabella smiled. His teeth were very sharp and white. 

"Very\r\nwell, Mr. Hughes, since you are a skeptic, perhaps you will not object\r\nto being the subject of our experiment yourself?"\r\n\r\n"What kind of an experiment?" Bill asked suspiciously.\r\n\r\n"Merely to go through the Door. Any door can become the Doorway, if it\r\nis transposed into the proper spatial dimension. That door, for\r\ninstance." Professor Falabella waved his hand toward the doorway of what\r\nGloria liked to call "Bill\'s study."\r\n\r\n"You mean you just want me to open the door and go into that room?" Bill\r\nasked incredulously. "That\'s all?

"\r\n\r\n"That is all. Of course, you go with the awareness that it is the\r\nthreshold of another plane and that you step voluntarily from this\r\nexistence to an adjacent one."\r\n\r\n"Sure," Bill said. He had just remembered there was a nearly full bottle\r\nof Calvert in the bottom drawer of the desk. "Sure. 

Anything to oblige."\r\n\r\n"Very well. Go to the door, and keep remembering that of your own free\r\nwill you are passing from this plane to the next."\r\n\r\n"Look out, everybody!" Bill called raucously, as he pulled open the\r\ndoor. "I\'m coming in on the next plane!"\r\n\r\nNo one laughed.\r\n\r\nHe stepped over the threshold, shutting the door firmly behind him. A\r\nwonderful excuse to get away from those blasted women. He\'d climb out of\r\nthe window as soon as he\'d collected the whiskey and give them a nervous\r\nmoment thinking he\'d really passed into another existence. It would\r\nserve Gloria right.\r\n\r\nFor a moment, as he crossed, he had a queer sensation. Maybe there was\r\nsomething in what Professor Falabella said. But no, there he was in the\r\nstudy. 

All that mumbo jumbo was getting him down, that was all. He was a\r\nnervous man--only nobody appreciated the fact.\r\n\r\nTaking a cigarette out of the pack in his pocket, he reached for the\r\nlighter on his desk. It wasn\'t there. Time and time again he\'d told\r\nGloria not to touch his things, and always she\'d disobeyed him. Company\r\nwas coming and she must tidy up. Cooking and cleaning--that was all she\r\nwas good for. But this was carrying tidiness too far; she\'d even removed\r\nthe ashtrays.\r\n\r\nAnd where did that glass block paperweight come from? He\'d had a penguin\r\nin a snowstorm and he\'d been happy with it. This was too much. 

He\'d tell\r\nGloria off. Stealing a man\'s penguin!\r\n\r\nHe opened the door into the living room and bumped into Lucy Allison.\r\n"Don\'t you think you\'ve been in there long enough, Bill?" she asked\r\nacridly. 

"I\'m sure your guests would appreciate catching a glimpse of\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Why, hello, Lucy," he said, surprised. "I didn\'t know Gloria had\r\ninvited you--"\r\n\r\n"Gloria, Gloria, Gloria!" Lucy cut across his sentence. "You\'ve been\r\ntalking about nothing but that dumb little blonde for months." Because\r\nof the people in the room beyond, her voice was pitched low, but her\r\npale eyes glittered unpleasantly behind her spectacles. "I wish you had\r\nmarried her. 

You\'d have made a fine pair."\r\n\r\nGently, caressingly, the short hairs on the back of Bill\'s neck rose.\r\n\r\n"Come back in here," Lucy said, hauling him back into the living room\r\nwhere a number of people who had been enjoying the domestic fracas\r\nsuddenly broke into loud and animated chatter. "Dr. Hildebrand was\r\ntelling us all about nuclear fission."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t find an ashtray," Bill muttered, seizing on something tangible.\r\n"Can\'t find an ashtray in the whole darn place."\r\n\r\n"We\'ve been over this millions of times, Bill. You know--" she smiled at\r\nthe guests, a smile that carefully excluded Bill. "--I\'m allergic to\r\nsmoke, but I never can get my husband to remember he isn\'t to smoke\r\ninside the house."\r\n\r\n"Now take the neutron, for example," Dr. 

Hildebrand said through a\r\nmouthful of p\xc3\xa2t\xc3\xa9. "What is the neutron? It is only ... What was that?"\r\n\r\nThe wraith of Gloria crossed the foyer and disappeared. Bill took a step\r\nforward; then stood still.\r\n\r\nLucy smiled self-consciously. "That\'s nothing at all. The house is\r\nmerely haunted."\r\n\r\nEveryone laughed.\r\n\r\n"Forgot something," Bill muttered, and dashed back into the study. He\r\nyanked open the bottom drawer of the desk. Sure enough, there was a\r\nbottle of Schenley, nearly a third full. "There are some advantages," he\r\nthought as he tilted it to his lips, "in having a limited imagination."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ September 1955.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

He had been taking his usual two-hour, after-lunch nap, but\r\ntoday it had brought him little refreshment. Earlier he had received an\r\nunexpected report that made sleep impossible.\r\n\r\n"John?" he mumbled.\r\n\r\nJohn Claxson, the generously padded assistant division chief, stopped\r\ndrilling out his earwax but did not remove his feet from the blotter of\r\nhis desk. "Yeah, Chief?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve heard from the Kentons again."\r\n\r\n"I thought something was deviling you, the way you was carrying on in\r\nyour sleep." He raised thick eyebrows. "Is their production down again?"\r\n\r\n"Worse than that, John. Kenton has had the gall to request time off to\r\nbuild a new house!"\r\n\r\n"No! I can\'t believe it.

"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t either, John. They know it\'s not in the Manual."\r\n\r\n"Certainly it\'s not, Chief. The nerve of those people wanting to do\r\nsomething that\'s not in the Manual!"\r\n\r\n"People like us wrote the Manual, John," the Chief added with simple\r\nmodesty. "That is why it is so good, good, good.

"\r\n\r\n"I know," said John, accepting the weight. Then he complained bitterly,\r\n"Wanting to build a new house! They are supposed to do personal stuff\r\nat night, or when it\'s raining."\r\n\r\nThe Chief allowed his rage to climb. "They\'ve got nothing to do but go\r\nout into the jungle and pick a little old bale of pretzins every day,\r\nbut do you think they are going to do it? No. They want _me_ to go and\r\ndo it for them!"\r\n\r\n"You can\'t _do_ it, Chief!" protested John.\r\n\r\n"You know I can\'t, John," agreed Wattles as he stretched. "I got all I\r\ncan manage right here. 

More."\r\n\r\n"What you got to do, Chief?" John asked curiously, forgetting caution\r\nfor a moment.\r\n\r\n"Plenty!" retorted the Chief.\r\n\r\n"I guess you have at that," John admitted, getting back aboard.\r\n\r\n"Time was," brooded the Chief, "when that Kenton was a fair pretzin\r\nfinder. But all he can think of to do now is to find excuses to\r\ngoldbrick. Wait until he sees the stiff memorandum I\'m sending him...."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBliss Kenton had not gone far from their Venusian jungle cabin\r\nthat morning before the vacuum snake hung one on her. The thick,\r\ntwo-foot-long pest lay very still on the ground, and she only got a\r\nglimpse of it before it jumped. 

Out it whipped to its full, slim,\r\nsix-foot length and wrapped around her throat. Fangs struck, and in\r\nthree seconds--with a loud _slurp_--it had withdrawn a quart of her\r\nblood. Then it unwrapped just as swiftly as it had come, and leaped\r\ninto the cover of the jungle.\r\n\r\nThe hefty young matron wobbled back to the cabin.\r\n\r\n"Pole!" she called as she hurried in. "I\'ve been slurped!"\r\n\r\n"Again?" her lanky husband asked, looking up from the reports on his\r\ndesk.\r\n\r\n"I\'m so sorry, Pole," she said contritely.\r\n\r\n"Well, sit down and start recovering, Bliss," he said in a kindly\r\nmanner. "You can\'t pick any pretzins today."\r\n\r\n"But I wanted to pick pretzins, Pole. Darn that vacuum snake and his\r\nfast draft."\r\n\r\n"I just hope the neighborhood dragon doesn\'t come around while you\'re\r\nin that weakened condition, Bliss," Pole worried as he totaled up the\r\nmonth\'s production on his reports. He decided, "I had better take time\r\noff from pretzin hunting today so I can be handy to help you with your\r\ngetaway, if need arises."\r\n\r\n"Oh, the dragon never bothers us," Bliss said uneasily.\r\n\r\n"He has gotten close enough to burn up several of our pretzin patches,\r\nthough. He may get to this cabin some day."\r\n\r\n"He doesn\'t mean any harm," defended Bliss. "I\'m sure he wouldn\'t want\r\nto eat us. They are known to be strictly vegetarians."\r\n\r\n"No, he won\'t eat us. 

He\'ll cook us, unless we can run away fast\r\nenough--but he\'ll never eat us."\r\n\r\nThey heard a faraway sound.\r\n\r\n"What is that crisp crackling that sounds like a dank forest burning?"\r\nwondered Bliss.\r\n\r\nPole scrambled to the door. "The dragon is coming! He\'s headed straight\r\nfor this cabin!"\r\n\r\n"Shall we be going?" asked Bliss, grabbing her clothes.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later, at a distance of a thousand yards, Pole and Bliss,\r\nloaded with all their portable possessions, watched their cabin burst\r\ninto flames as a roaring, forty-foot lizard, with fifty-foot flames\r\ngouting from his mouth, ambled through their clearing.\r\n\r\n"There, he\'s gone," said Pole as the dragon passed on. "I\'d better put\r\nout the fire."\r\n\r\nDipping water from a nearby pond with a bucket, Pole had, after\r\nfifty-three fast buckets, a blackened ruin of what had formerly been\r\ntheir rude jungle cabin.\r\n\r\nPole moved a new, nearly finished split-pole settee he had been working\r\non back in the jungle to their front porch. As they seated themselves,\r\nhe complacently surveyed the slits burned between the charred boards of\r\nthe walls and roof. "The roof will leak a mite when it rains, but it\r\nwill let in lots of light," he observed optimistically.\r\n\r\n"There\'s nothing like lots of light," Bliss agreed.\r\n\r\n"Charcoal is healthful, too."\r\n\r\n"It absorbs poison like nobody\'s business!"\r\n\r\n"However, since it rains every day on Venus we will have to have a new\r\ncabin." He sighed resignedly. "And you know what that means: Lower\r\nproduction, fewer of the magical, antibiotic pretzins. I\'d better radio\r\nthe Division Chief."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs the jet plane flashed across their vision, the Kentons saw a tiny\r\nbundle drop from it. Pole ran out into the jungle and was under the\r\nparachute when it landed. He came back into the clearing unwrapping a\r\npackage.\r\n\r\n"It sure was thoughtful of Mr. Wattles to answer so fast," said Pole,\r\nas he opened the little package. "And will you look here in the middle!\r\nHe even sent us a present!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s a beautiful, plain white, rectangular carton of approximately\r\nthree by seven inches," she said breathlessly.\r\n\r\n"But we mustn\'t be selfish," Pole reminded hastily. "Let\'s see what Mr.\r\nWattles has to say in his memorandum here first." They both read the\r\ngreen memorandum.\r\n\r\n    To: Napoleon B. Kenton, Special Agent, Pretzin Division, Venus\r\n\r\n    From: Chief, Pretzin Division, Venusport, Venus\r\n\r\n    Subject: Personal Problems of Special Agents\r\n\r\n    In a radio message dated January 25, 1982 you related certain\r\n    personal problems you were experiencing, and you stated that delays\r\n    might be encountered in your harvesting of pretzins. We regret your\r\n    difficulties. 

However, it is believed these misfortunes may be\r\n    overcome during leisure hours and should be soon resolved without\r\n    loss of a measurable part of your productive time.\r\n\r\nPole interrupted his reading to beam at his wife. "He\'s sorry for us,\r\nBliss, and he hopes things will be better for us soon.

"\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t he the nicest man?"\r\n\r\nThey read on.\r\n\r\n    In your radio message you refer to difficulties you are having with\r\n    a snake and a lizard (which you colloquially refer to as a dragon).\r\n    It is believed that the enclosed package, serial number 93G-18,\r\n    will cope with the matter, and that no further report will be\r\n    necessary with respect to snakes and lizards.\r\n\r\n    Carl Wattles\r\n    Chief, Pretzin Division\r\n\r\nEagerly Bliss Kenton opened the plain white carton bearing the serial\r\nnumber 93G-18. She slid out the two and three-quarter by six and\r\none-half inch fumigation bomb can.\r\n\r\nBliss read the label. "\'Lizards and snakes go \'way and stay. Only\r\n$1.19 F.O.B.U.S.A.\' Why, it rhymes!" she said, a wondering smile\r\nlighting her face.\r\n\r\n"Does it say how long the lizards are that go \'way and stay?" Pole\r\nasked anxiously, thinking of the neighborhood\'s forty-foot hellion.\r\n\r\n"_All_ lizards, it says. And only $1.19."\r\n\r\n"Good! But how about snakes that can jump ten feet and wrap around your\r\nthroat?"\r\n\r\n"I read that wrong," she amended. "All lizards _and snakes_. 

And only\r\n$1.19."\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad," said Pole, choking up.\r\n\r\n"The Division Chief has been thinking of us," said Bliss, wiping away a\r\ntear.\r\n\r\n"He knows we field personnel have our problems."\r\n\r\n"He knew just what we needed," lauded Bliss.\r\n\r\nPole looked up from the canister as he heard a sound. "And here comes\r\nthe dragon back! Our lizard repellent arrived just in the nick of time!"\r\n\r\nDown the rain-forest aisle the roaring mammoth rapidly waddled. Its\r\nflames--even longer than its body--withered into blackened ruin\r\nall that stood before it. This time, instead of snatching up their\r\npossessions and fleeing to safety, the Kentons stood their ground\r\nwith their pocket-size fumigation bomb that had been designed for\r\npocket-sized lizards. When the dragon was within throwing distance,\r\nPole flipped on the spray jet of the tiny bomb and threw it as\r\nstraight as he could. Then both of them sped away, leaving all their\r\npossessions at the mercy of the advancing, ravening flames....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Oh, Pole! Isn\'t our new home just the dandiest that a Venusian\r\npretzin-gathering couple ever had?"\r\n\r\n"It _is_ dandy," concurred Pole. "Who\'d ever have thought we would\r\nhave a cabin that was only an inch thick, and yet was absolutely water\r\ntight?"\r\n\r\n"The table makes a dandy smokestack too, when it\'s propped up.\r\nFireproof."\r\n\r\n"How about the mouth when it\'s propped open?" 

challenged Pole. "Who\r\ncould beat a front porch like that?"\r\n\r\n"You can\'t. 

You just can\'t!"\r\n\r\n"Correct." He ruminated, "We\'d never have been able to cut the hide.\r\nNot a tough, inch-thick one like this one."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll never get over the way you gutted the dragon. You cut him loose\r\ninside, just below the tonsils--"\r\n\r\n"And after I lassoed them, I gave a run--"\r\n\r\n"And all his guts came stringing out!"\r\n\r\n"Had him cleaned to the bone within an hour!" said Pole proudly.\r\n\r\n"We would never have had it so good if it hadn\'t been for Mr. Wattles\'\r\nhelpfulness," reminded Bliss. "That fumigation bomb, besides making a\r\nhorrible stink--"\r\n\r\n"--explodes when it enters a dragon\'s flaming mouth--and blows his\r\nmethane tanks."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


"\r\n\r\n"As before?" Without waiting for an answer, he continued, the coin\r\nclutched tightly in one hand. "I\'m Charles J. Fisher, professor of\r\nPhilosophy at Reiser College."\r\n\r\nHe looked at me quickly. 

"Or at least I was until recently." For a\r\nsecond his face was boyish. "Professor of Philosophy, that is."\r\n\r\nI smiled and found that I was staring at the coin in his hand. He gave\r\nit to me. On one side I read the words: THE STATEMENT ON THE OTHER SIDE\r\nOF THIS COIN IS FALSE. The patient watched me with an expressionless\r\nface; I turned over the coin. It was engraved with the words: THE\r\nSTATEMENT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS COIN IS FALSE.\r\n\r\n"That\'s not the problem," he said, "not _my_ problem. I had the coin\r\nmade when I was an undergraduate. I enjoyed reading one side, turning\r\nit over, reading the other side, and so on. A fiendish enjoyment like\r\nboys planning where to put the tipped-over outhouse."\r\n\r\nI looked at the patient. He was thirty-eight, single, medium build, had\r\nan M.A. and Ph.D. 

from an eastern university. I knew this and more from\r\nthe folder on my desk.\r\n\r\n"Eight months ago," he continued, "I read about the sphere found on\r\nPaney Island." He stopped, looking at me questioningly.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know," I said. I opened my desk drawer, took out a clipping\r\nfrom the newspaper, and handed it to him.\r\n\r\n"That\'s it."\r\n\r\nI read the clipping before putting it back in the drawer.\r\n\r\n    Manila, Sept. 24 (INS) Archeologists from University of California\r\n    have discovered in earth fault of recent quake a sphere two feet in\r\n    diameter of an unidentifiable material.\r\n\r\n    Dr. Karl Schwartz, head of the group, said the sphere was returned\r\n    to the University for study. He declined to answer questions on the\r\n    cultural origin of the sphere.\r\n\r\n"There wasn\'t any more in the newspapers about it," he said. "I have a\r\nfriend in California who got me the photographs.

"\r\n\r\n_He looked at me intently. 

"You won\'t believe any of this." He pressed\r\nthe coin into the palm of his hand. "You won\'t be able to."_\r\n\r\n"The photographs," he continued, as if lecturing, "were of characters\r\nprojected by the sphere when placed before a focused light. The sphere\r\nwas transparent, you see, imbedded with dark microscopic specks. By\r\nmoving the sphere a certain distance each time, there was a total\r\nprojection of three hundred and sixty different characters in eighteen\r\ndifferent orderings. Or nineteen different orderings if you count one\r\nwhich was a list of all the characters."\r\n\r\nI made a mental note of the numbers. I felt they were significant.\r\n\r\n"As I said," he continued, "I obtained the photographs of the\r\ncharacters. Very strange shapes, totally unlike the characters of\r\nOriental languages, but yet that is the closest way to describe them."\r\nHe jerked forward in his chair, "Except, of course, ostensively.

"\r\n\r\n"Later," I said. 

I wanted to get through the preliminaries first. There\r\nwould be time later to see the photographs.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n"The characters projected by the sphere," he said, "weren\'t like the\r\ncharacters of any known language." He paused dramatically. "There was\r\nreason to believe they had origin in an unknown culture. A culture more\r\nscientifically advanced than our own."\r\n\r\n"And the reasons for this supposition?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"The material ... the material of the sphere. It could only be roughly\r\nclassified as _ferro-plastic_. Totally unknown, amazing imperviousness.\r\nA synthetic material, hardly the product of a former culture."\r\n\r\n"From Mars?" I said, smiling.\r\n\r\n"There were all kinds of conjectures, but, of course, the important\r\nthing was to see if the projection of characters was a message. The\r\nmessage, if any, would mean more than any conjecture."\r\n\r\n"You translated it?"\r\n\r\n_He polished the coin on his jacket. "You won\'t dare believe it," he\r\nsaid sharply._\r\n\r\nHe cleared his throat and stiffened into a more rigid posture. "It\r\nwasn\'t exactly translation. You see, _to us_ none of the characters had\r\ndesignation. They were just characters."\r\n\r\n"So it was a problem of decoding?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"As it turned out, no. Decoding is dependent on knowledge of language\r\ncharacteristics--characteristics of known languages. Decoding was\r\ntried, but without success. No, what we had to find was a key to the\r\nlanguage."\r\n\r\n"You mean like the Rune Stone?"\r\n\r\n"More or less. In principle, we needed a picture of a cow, and a sign\r\nof meaning indicating one of the characters.\r\n\r\n"For me, there was no possibility of finding similarities between the\r\ncharacters and characters of other languages--that would require\r\ntremendous linguistic knowledge and library facilities. Nor could I use\r\na decoding approach--that would require special knowledge of techniques\r\nand access to electronic computers and other mechanical aids. No, I had\r\nto work on the assumption that the key to the sphere was implicit in\r\nthe sphere."\r\n\r\n"You hoped to find the key to the language in the language itself?"\r\n\r\n"Exactly. You know, of course, some languages do have an implicit key?\r\nFor example hieroglyphics or picture language. The word for _cow_ is a\r\npicture of a cow.

"\r\n\r\n_He looked at the toes of his shoes. "You won\'t be able to believe it.\r\nIt\'s impossible to believe. I use the word impossible in its logical\r\nsense._\r\n\r\n"In most languages," he continued, looking up from his shoes, "the\r\nsound of some words themselves indicates the meaning of the word.\r\nOnomatopoetic words like _bowwow, buzz_."\r\n\r\n"And the key to the unknown language?" I asked. 

"How did you find it?"\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nI watched him push the coin against the back of his arm, then lift it\r\nto read the backward letters pressed into his skin. He looked up at me\r\nand smiled.\r\n\r\n"I built models of the characters. Big material ones, exactly\r\nproportionate to the ones projected. Then--quite by accident--I viewed\r\none of them through a glass globe the size of the original sphere. What\r\ndo you think I saw?"\r\n\r\n"What?" I noticed he had the boyish look again.\r\n\r\n"A distortion of the model. But that\'s not what\'s important. The\r\ndistortions, on study, gave specific visual entities. Like when looking\r\nat one of those trick pictures and suddenly seeing the lion in the\r\ngrass. The lines outlining the lion are there all the time, only the\r\nobserver has to view them as the outline of a lion. It was the same\r\nwith the models of the characters, except the shapes that appeared were\r\nnot of lions or other recognizable things. But they did suggest."\r\n\r\n_He pressed the coin against his forehead, closed his eyes and appeared\r\nto be thinking deeply. "Yes, impossible to believe. 

No one can believe\r\nit."_\r\n\r\n"In addition to the visual response, the distortions gave me definite\r\nfeelings. Not mixtures of feelings, but one definite emotional\r\nexperience."\r\n\r\n"How do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"One character when viewed through the globe gave me a visual image\r\nand, at the same time, a strong feeling of light hilarity."\r\n\r\n"I take it then that these distortions seemed to connote meanings,\r\nrather than denote them. You might say that their meaning was conveyed\r\nthrough a Gestalt experience on the part of the observer."\r\n\r\n"Yes, each character gave a definite Gestalt. But, the Gestalt was the\r\nsame for each observer. Or at least for thirty-five observers there was\r\nan eighty per cent correlation."\r\n\r\nI whistled softly. "And the translation?"\r\n\r\n"Doctor, what would you say if I told you the translation was\r\nunbelievable; that it couldn\'t be seriously entertained by any man?\r\nWhat if I said that it would take the sanity of any man who believed\r\nit?"\r\n\r\n"I would say that it might well be incorrect."\r\n\r\nHe took some papers from his pocket and laughed excitedly, slumping\r\ndown in the chair. "This is the complete translation in idiomatic\r\nEnglish. I\'m going to let you read it, but first I want you to consider\r\na few things."\r\n\r\nHe hid the papers behind the back of his chair; his face became even\r\nmore boyish, almost as if he were deciding on where to put the tipped\r\nover outhouse.\r\n\r\n"Consider first, doctor, that there was a total projection of three\r\nhundred and sixty different characters. The same number as the number\r\nof degrees in a circle. Consider also that there were eighteen\r\ndifferent orderings of the characters, or nineteen counting the\r\nalphabetical list. The square root of three hundred and sixty would lie\r\nbetween eighteen and nineteen."\r\n\r\n"Yes," I said. I remembered there was something significant about the\r\nnumbers, but I wasn\'t at all sure that it was this.\r\n\r\n"Consider also," he continued, "that the communication was through the\r\nmedium of a sphere. Moreover, keep in mind that physics accepts the\r\npath of a beam of light as its definition of a straight line. Yet, the\r\npath is a curve; if extended sufficiently it would be a circle, the\r\nsection of a sphere.

"\r\n\r\n"All right," I said. By now the patient was pounding the coin against\r\nthe sole of one shoe.\r\n\r\n"And," he said, "keep in mind that in some sense time can be thought of\r\nas another dimension." He suddenly thrust the papers at me and sat back\r\nin the chair.\r\n\r\nI picked up the translation and began reading. The patient sat stiffly\r\nin the leather chair on the other side of the desk. Nervously he\r\npressed a coin into the palm of one hand.\r\n\r\n"Just start anywhere," I said, "and tell me all about it."\r\n\r\n"As before?" Without waiting for an answer, he continued, the coin\r\nclutched tightly in one hand. "I\'m Charles J. Fisher, professor of\r\nphilosophy at Reiser College."\r\n\r\nHe looked at me quickly. 

"Or at least I was until recently." For a\r\nsecond his face was boyish. "Professor of philosophy, that is."\r\n\r\nI smiled and found that I was staring at the coin in his hand. He gave\r\nit to me. On one side I read the words: THE STATEMENT ON THE OTHER SIDE\r\nOF THIS COIN IS FALSE. The patient watched....\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n


copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Because this is a masculine world, the author of this fairytale is\r\n     usually identified as the wife of Poul Anderson. But a few more\r\n     incisive cameos of fantasy such as this, and Mr. Anderson may come\r\n     to be identified as Karen\'s husband._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe edge of the world is fenced off stoutly enough, but the fence isn\'t\r\nmade that will stop a boy. Johnny tossed his pack and coil of rope over\r\nit and started climbing. 

The top three strands were barbed wire. He\r\ncaught his shirt as he went over, and had to stop for a moment to ease\r\nhimself off. Then he dropped lightly to the grass on the other side.\r\n\r\nThe pack had landed in a clump of white clover. A cloud of disturbed\r\nbees hung above, and he snatched it away quickly lest they should notice\r\nthe honeycomb inside.\r\n\r\nFor a minute he stood still, looking out over the edge. This was\r\ndifferent from looking through the fence, and when he moved it was\r\nslowly. He eased himself to the ground where a corner of rock rose clear\r\nof the thick larkspur and lay on his belly, the stone hard and cool\r\nunder his chin, and looked down.\r\n\r\nThe granite cliff curved away out of sight, and he couldn\'t see if it\r\nhad a foot. He saw only endless blue, beyond, below, and on both sides.\r\nClouds passed slowly.\r\n\r\nDirectly beneath him there was a ledge covered with long grass where\r\nclusters of stars bloomed on tall, slender stalks.\r\n\r\nHe uncoiled his rope and found a stout beech tree not too close to the\r\nedge. Doubling the rope around the bole, he tied one end around his\r\nwaist, slung the pack on his back, and belayed himself down the cliff.\r\nPebbles clattered, saxifrage brushed his arms and tickled his ears; once\r\nhe groped for a hold with his face in a patch of rustling ferns.\r\n\r\nThe climb was hard, but not too much. Less than half an hour later he\r\nwas stretched out on the grass with stars nodding about him. They had a\r\nsharp, gingery smell. He lay in the cool shadow of the world\'s edge for\r\na while, eating apples and honeycomb from his pack. When he was finished\r\nhe licked the honey off his fingers and threw the apple cores over,\r\nwatching them fall into the blue.\r\n\r\nLittle islands floated along, rocking gently in air eddies. Sunlight\r\nflashed on glossy leaves of bushes growing there. 

When an island drifted\r\ninto the shadow of the cliff, the blossoming stars shone out. Beyond the\r\nshadows, deep in the light-filled gulf, he saw the hippogriffs at play.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere were dozens of them, frisking and cavorting in the air. He gazed\r\nat them full of wonder. 

They pretended to fight, stooped at one another,\r\nsoared off in long spirals to stoop and soar and stoop again. One\r\nflashed by him, a golden palomino that shone like polished wood. The\r\nwind whistled in its wings.\r\n\r\nAway to the left, the cliff fell back in a wide crescent, and nearly\r\nopposite him a river tumbled over the edge. A pool on a ledge beneath\r\ncaught most of the water, and there were hippogriffs drinking. One side\r\nof the broad pool was notched. The overflow fell sheer in a white plume\r\nblown sideways by the wind.\r\n\r\nAs the sun grew hotter, the hippogriffs began to settle and browse on\r\nthe islands that floated past. Not far below, he noticed, a dozen or so\r\nstood drowsily on an island that was floating through the cliff\'s shadow\r\ntoward his ledge. It would pass directly below him.\r\n\r\nWith a sudden resolution, Johnny jerked his rope down from the tree\r\nabove and tied the end to a projecting knob on the cliff. Slinging on\r\nhis pack again, he slid over the edge and down the rope.\r\n\r\nThe island was already passing. The end of the rope trailed through the\r\ngrass. He slithered down and cut a piece off his line.\r\n\r\nIt was barely long enough after he had tied a noose in the end. He\r\nlooked around at the hippogriffs. They had shied away when he dropped\r\nonto the island, but now they stood still, watching him warily.\r\n\r\nJohnny started to take an apple out of his pack, then changed his mind\r\nand took a piece of honeycomb. He broke off one corner and tossed it\r\ntoward them. They fluttered their wings and backed off a few steps, then\r\nstood still again.\r\n\r\nJohnny sat down to wait. They were mostly chestnuts and blacks, and some\r\nhad white stockings. One was piebald. That was the one which, after a\r\nwhile, began edging closer to where the honeycomb had fallen. Johnny sat\r\nvery still.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe piebald sniffed at the honeycomb, then jerked up its head to watch\r\nhim suspiciously. He didn\'t move. After a moment it took the honeycomb.\r\n\r\nWhen he threw another bit, the piebald hippogriff wheeled away, but\r\nreturned almost at once and ate it. Johnny tossed a third piece only a\r\nfew yards from where he was sitting.\r\n\r\nIt was bigger than the others, and the hippogriff had to bite it in two.\r\nWhen the hippogriff bent its head to take the rest Johnny was on his\r\nfeet instantly, swinging his lariat. He dropped the noose over the\r\nhippogriff\'s head. For a moment the animal was too startled to do\r\nanything; then Johnny was on its back, clinging tight.\r\n\r\nThe piebald hippogriff leaped into the air, and Johnny clamped his legs\r\nabout convulsed muscles. Pinions whipped against his knees and wind\r\nblasted his eyes. The world tilted; they were rushing downward. His\r\nknees pressed the sockets of the enormous wings.\r\n\r\nThe distant ramparts of the world swung madly, and he seemed to fall\r\nupward, away from the sun that suddenly glared under the hippogriff\'s\r\ntalons. He forced his knees under the roots of the beating wings and dug\r\nheels into prickling hair. A sob caught his breath and he clenched his\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\nThe universe righted itself about him for a moment and he pulled breath\r\ninto his lungs. Then they plunged again. 

Wind searched under his shirt.\r\nOnce he looked down. After that he kept his eyes on the flutter of the\r\nfeather-mane.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA jolt sent him sliding backward. He clutched the rope with slippery\r\nfingers. The wings missed a beat and the hippogriff shook its head as\r\nthe rope momentarily checked its breath. It tried to fly straight up,\r\nlost way, and fell stiff-winged. The long muscles stretched under him as\r\nit arched its back, then bunched when it kicked straight out behind. The\r\nviolence loosened his knees and he trembled with fatigue, but he wound\r\nthe rope around his wrists and pressed his forehead against whitened\r\nknuckles. Another kick, and another. Johnny dragged at the rope.\r\n\r\nThe tense wings flailed, caught air, and brought the hippogriff upright\r\nagain. The rope slackened and he heard huge gasps. Sunlight was hot on\r\nhim again and a drop of sweat crawled down his temple. It tickled. 

He\r\nloosened one hand to dab at the annoyance. A new twist sent him sliding\r\nand he grabbed the rope. The tickle continued until he nearly screamed.\r\nHe no longer dared let go. Another tickle developed beside the first. He\r\nscrubbed his face against the coarse fibre of the rope; the relief was\r\nlike a world conquered.\r\n\r\nThen they glided in a steady spiral that carried them upward with\r\nscarcely a feather\'s motion. When the next plunge came Johnny was ready\r\nfor it and leaned back until the hippogriff arched its neck, trying to\r\nfree itself from the pressure on its windpipe. Half choked, it glided\r\nagain, and Johnny gave it breath.\r\n\r\nThey landed on one of the little islands. The hippogriff drooped its\r\nhead and wings, trembling.\r\n\r\nHe took another piece of honeycomb from his pack and tossed it to the\r\nground where the hippogriff could reach it easily. While it ate he\r\nstroked it and talked to it. When he dismounted the hippogriff took\r\nhoneycomb from his hand. He stroked its neck, breathing the sweet warm\r\nfeathery smell, and laughed aloud when it snuffled the back of his neck.\r\n\r\nTying the rope into a sort of hackamore, he mounted again and rode the\r\nhippogriff to the pool below the thunder and cold spray of the\r\nwaterfall. He took care that it did not drink too much. When he ate some\r\napples for his lunch, the hippogriff ate the cores.\r\n\r\nAfterward he rode to one of the drifting islands and let his mount\r\ngraze. For a while he kept by its side, making much of it. 

With his\r\nfingers, he combed out the soft flowing plumes of its mane, and examined\r\nits hoofs and the sickle-like talons of the forelegs. He saw how the\r\nsmooth feathers on its forequarters became finer and finer until he\r\ncould scarcely see where the hair on the hindquarters began. Delicate\r\nfeathers covered its head.\r\n\r\nThe island glided further and further away from the cliffs, and he\r\nwatched the waterfall dwindle away to a streak and disappear. After a\r\nwhile he fell asleep.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe woke with a start, suddenly cold: the setting sun was below his\r\nisland. 

The feathery odor was still on his hands. He looked around for\r\nthe hippogriff and saw it sniffing at his pack.\r\n\r\nWhen it saw him move, it trotted up to him with an expectant air. He\r\nthrew his arms about the great flat-muscled neck and pressed his face\r\nagainst the warm feathers, with a faint sense of embarrassment at\r\nfeeling tears in his eyes.\r\n\r\n"Good old Patch," he said, and got his pack. He shared the last piece of\r\nhoneycomb with his hippogriff and watched the sun sink still further.\r\nThe clouds were turning red.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s go see those clouds," Johnny said. He mounted the piebald\r\nhippogriff and they flew off, up through the golden air to the sunset\r\nclouds. There they stopped and Johnny dismounted on the highest cloud of\r\nall, stood there as it turned slowly gray, and looked into dimming\r\ndepths. When he turned to look at the world, he saw only a wide smudge\r\nof darkness spread in the distance.\r\n\r\nThe cloud they were standing on turned silver. Johnny glanced up and saw\r\nthe moon, a crescent shore far above.\r\n\r\nHe ate an apple and gave one to his hippogriff. While he chewed he gazed\r\nback at the world. When he finished his apple, he was about to toss the\r\ncore to the hippogriff, but stopped himself and carefully took out the\r\nseeds first. With the seeds in his pocket, he mounted again.\r\n\r\nHe took a deep breath. "Come on, Patch," he said. 

"Let\'s homestead the\r\nmoon."\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s The Piebald Hippogriff, by Karen Anderson\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


"\r\n\r\n"Know what?" Eklund demanded. 

"What does it say? Does she accept?"\r\n\r\n"She accepts," Christianson said in a peculiar half-strangled tone as he\r\npassed the letter to Eklund. "See for yourself."\r\n\r\nEklund\'s reaction was different. His face was a mottled reddish white as\r\nhe finished the letter and handed it across the table to Carlstrom. "Why,"\r\nhe demanded of no one in particular, "did this have to happen to us?"\r\n\r\n"It was bound to happen sometime," Carlstrom said. "It\'s just our\r\nmisfortune that it happened to us." He chuckled as he passed the letter\r\nback to Christianson. "At least this year the presentation should be an\r\nevent worth remembering."\r\n\r\n"It seems that we have a little problem," Christianson said, making what\r\nwould probably be the understatement of the century. Possibly there would\r\nbe greater understatements in the remaining ninety-nine years of the\r\nTwenty-first Century, but Carlstrom doubted it. "We certainly have our\r\nnecks out," he agreed.\r\n\r\n"We can\'t do it!" Eklund exploded. "We simply can\'t award the Nobel Prize\r\nin medicine and physiology to that ... that _C. Edie_!" He sputtered into\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n"We can hardly do anything else," Christianson said. "There\'s no\r\nquestion as to the identity of the winner. Dr. Hanson\'s letter makes\r\nthat unmistakably clear. And there\'s no question that the award is\r\ndeserved."\r\n\r\n"We still could award it to someone else," Eklund said.\r\n\r\n"Not a chance. We\'ve already said too much to the press. It\'s known all\r\nover the world that the medical award is going to the discoverer of the\r\nbasic cause of cancer, to the founder of modern neoplastic therapy."\r\nChristianson grimaced. "If we changed our decision now, there\'d be all\r\nsorts of embarrassing questions from the press."\r\n\r\n"I can see it now," Carlstrom said, "the banquet, the table, the flowers,\r\nand Professor Doctor Nels Christianson in formal dress with the Order\r\nof St. Olaf gleaming across his white shirtfront, standing before that\r\ndistinguished audience and announcing: \'The Nobel Prize in Medicine and\r\nPhysiology is awarded to--\' and then that deadly hush when the audience\r\nsees the winner."\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t rub it in," Christianson said unhappily. 

"I can see it, too."\r\n\r\n"These Americans!" Eklund said bitterly. He wiped his damp forehead. The\r\npicture Carlstrom had drawn was accurate but hardly appealing. "One simply\r\ncan\'t trust them. Publishing a report as important as that as a laboratory\r\nrelease. They should have given proper credit."\r\n\r\n"They did," Carlstrom said. "They did--precisely. But the world, including\r\nus, was too stupid to see it. We have only ourselves to blame."\r\n\r\n"If it weren\'t for the fact that the work was inspired and effective,"\r\nChristianson muttered, "we might have a chance of salvaging this situation.\r\nBut through its application ninety-five per cent of cancers are now\r\ncurable. It is obviously the outstanding contribution to medicine in the\r\npast five decades."\r\n\r\n"But we must consider the source," Eklund protested. "This award will make\r\nthe prize for medicine a laughingstock. No doctor will ever accept another.\r\nIf we go through with this, we might as well forget about the medical award\r\nfrom now on. This will be its swan song. 

It hits too close to home. Too\r\nmany people have been saying similar things about our profession and its\r\ntrend toward specialization. And to have the Nobel Prize confirm them\r\nwould alienate every doctor in the world. We simply can\'t do it."\r\n\r\n"Yet who else has made a comparable discovery? Or one that is even half as\r\nimportant?" 

Christianson asked.\r\n\r\n"That\'s a good question," Carlstrom said, "and a good answer to it\r\nisn\'t going to be easy to find. For my part, I can only wish that Alphax\r\nLaboratories had displayed an interest in literature rather than medicine.\r\nThen our colleagues at the Academy could have had the painful decision."\r\n\r\n"Their task would be easier than ours," Christianson said wearily. "After\r\nall, the criteria of art are more flexible. Medicine, unfortunately, is\r\nbased upon facts."\r\n\r\n"That\'s the hell of it," Carlstrom said.\r\n\r\n"There must be some way to solve this problem," Eklund said. "After all\r\nit was a perfectly natural mistake. We never suspected that Alphax was a\r\nphysical rather than a biological sciences laboratory. Perhaps that might\r\noffer grounds--"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think so," Carlstrom interrupted. "The means in this case aren\'t\r\nas important as the results, and we can\'t deny that the cancer problem is\r\nvirtually solved."\r\n\r\n"Even though men have been saying for the past two generations that the\r\nanswer was probably in the literature and all that was needed was someone\r\nwith the intelligence and the time to put the facts together, the fact\r\nremains that it was C. Edie who did the job. And it required quite a bit\r\nmore than merely collecting facts. 

Intelligence and original thinking of\r\na high order was involved." Christianson sighed.\r\n\r\n"Some_one_," Eklund said bitterly. "Some _thing_ you mean. _C.\r\nEdie_--C.E.D.--Computer, Extrapolating, Discriminatory. Manufactured\r\nby Alphax Laboratories, Trenton, New Jersey, U.S.A. _C. 

Edie!_\r\nAmericans!!--always naming things. A machine wins the Nobel Prize.\r\nIt\'s fantastic!"\r\n\r\nChristianson shook his head. 

"It\'s not fantastic, unfortunately. 

And I\r\nsee no way out. We can\'t even award the prize to the team of engineers who\r\ndesigned and built Edie. Dr. Hanson is right when he says the discovery was\r\nEdie\'s and not the engineers\'. It would be like giving the prize to Albert\r\nEinstein\'s parents because they created him."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Is there any way we can keep the presentation secret?" Eklund asked.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid not. The presentations are public. We\'ve done too good a job\r\npublicizing the Nobel Prize. As a telecast item, it\'s almost the equal of\r\nthe motion picture Academy Award."\r\n\r\n"I can imagine the reaction when our candidate is revealed in all her\r\nmetallic glory. A two-meter cube of steel filled with microminiaturized\r\ncircuits, complete with flashing lights and cogwheels," Carlstrom chuckled.\r\n"And where are you going to hang the medal?"\r\n\r\nChristianson shivered. "I wish you wouldn\'t give that metal nightmare a\r\npersonality," he said. "It unnerves me. 

Personally, I wish that Dr. Hanson,\r\nAlphax Laboratories, and Edie were all at the bottom of the ocean--in some\r\nnice deep spot like the Mariannas Trench." He shrugged. 

"Of course, we\r\nwon\'t have that sort of luck, so we\'ll have to make the best of it."\r\n\r\n"It just goes to show that you can\'t trust Americans," Eklund said. "I\'ve\r\nalways thought we should keep our awards on this side of the Atlantic where\r\npeople are sane and civilized. Making a personality out of a computer--ugh!\r\nI suppose it\'s their idea of a joke."\r\n\r\n"I doubt it," Christianson said. "They just like to name things--preferably\r\nwith female names. It\'s a form of insecurity, the mother fixation. But\r\nthat\'s not important. I\'m afraid, gentlemen, that we shall have to make\r\nthe award as we have planned. I can see no way out. After all, there\'s no\r\nreason why the machine cannot receive the prize. The conditions merely\r\nstate that it is to be presented to the one, regardless of nationality,\r\nwho makes the greatest contribution to medicine or physiology."\r\n\r\n"I wonder how His Majesty will take it," Carlstrom said.\r\n\r\n"The king! I\'d forgotten that!" Eklund gasped.\r\n\r\n"I expect he\'ll have to take it," Christianson said. "He might even\r\nappreciate the humor in the situation."\r\n\r\n"Gustaf Adolf is a good king, but there are limits," Eklund observed.\r\n\r\n"There are other considerations," Christianson replied. "After all, Edie is\r\nthe reason the Crown Prince is still alive, and Gustaf is fond of his son."\r\n\r\n"After all these years?"\r\n\r\nChristianson smiled. Swedish royalty _was_ long-lived. It was something\r\nof a standing joke that King Gustaf would probably outlast the pyramids,\r\nproviding the pyramids lived in Sweden. "I\'m sure His Majesty will\r\ncooperate. He has a strong sense of duty and since the real problem is\r\nhis, not ours, I doubt if he will shirk it."\r\n\r\n"How do you figure that?" Eklund asked.\r\n\r\n"We merely select the candidates according to the rules, and according\r\nto the nature of their contribution. Edie is obviously the outstanding\r\ncandidate in medicine for this year. It deserves the prize. We would\r\nbe compromising with principle if we did not award it fairly."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you\'re right," Eklund said gloomily. "I can\'t think of any\r\nreasonable excuse to deny the award."\r\n\r\n"Nor I," Carlstrom said. "But what did you mean by that remark about\r\nthis being the king\'s problem?"\r\n\r\n"You forget," Christianson said mildly. "Of all of us, the king has the\r\nmost difficult part. As you know, the Nobel Prize is formally presented\r\nat a State banquet."\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"His Majesty is the host," Christianson said. "And just how does one eat\r\ndinner with an electronic computer?"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSCRIBER\'S NOTES\r\n\r\n\r\nThis etext was produced from Analog Science Fact and Science Fiction\r\nApril 1961.

The two deactivated robots\r\nand the framework that suspended the limp suit hardly left room for him\r\nto move around. At the moment he felt mildly disgusted with this whole\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\nHe asked himself why engagements and marriages had to be surrounded\r\nwith tradition and ridiculous games. But, of course, he had to go\r\nthrough with it. Myrna seemed to have been filled with excitement when\r\nthey were discussing the final plans for the ceremony. He might as well\r\nget started. 

He glanced at the clock; it was almost eight. He picked up\r\nthe book of rules and looked at it again.\r\n\r\nHe re-read the instructions for operating the mechanism. First,\r\nit said, inspect the facsimile and see that it is well-groomed and\r\nentirely in order. He looked at the two lifeless twins of himself.\r\nYes, they looked all right. He decided which one he would use tonight.\r\nThen, he read, he was to get into the suit (the book called it a\r\nharness), activate the selected facsimile, and set the controls. It\r\nwent on to say that every movement he made would be duplicated by the\r\nrobot. Everything the facsimile experienced would be transmitted to the\r\nharness becoming his experiences. Well, he had practiced all that since\r\nrenting the thing three days ago. He turned towards the marriage game\r\nrules.\r\n\r\nThe rules dictated seven situations. That would mean, in his case,\r\nseven evenings for Myrna and him to decide whether they were meeting\r\neach other\'s robots or their real selves.\r\n\r\nThe book pointed out that the primary or real body had to be used\r\nat least once in the first five situations. The first contestant to\r\ncorrectly identify the other\'s real body won the game and the contest\r\nwas over. The winner received commendation and was supposed to be the\r\ndominant spouse. Of course, the last was mere convention. However,\r\nthe most important, the most rigid, and to Thad the most fantastic,\r\nrule in the whole contest was that if the girl won, the couple was\r\nrequired to wait a year before completing the marriage ceremony. That\r\nseemed a weightier matter to Morgan. He read on. The first contestant\r\nwho correctly identified the other as a facsimile won a point. If\r\nhe failed, the other contestant had the opportunity to make an\r\nidentification. The situation ended when one contestant made a correct\r\nidentification or when both failed. Laying the book down, he decided\r\nhe\'d better get started because it was getting late.\r\n\r\nHe climbed into the harness and hung in mid-air suspended by his belt.\r\nHe activated one of his facsimiles and turned his head so he could see\r\nhimself through the robot\'s eyes. Thumbing his nose, he watched the\r\ncreature hanging in the harness do likewise. It gave him an eerie\r\nfeeling. Even though he knew he was walking in thin air and getting\r\nnowhere, it really seemed as if he could feel the floor under his feet\r\nand see the room move around him in a very ordinary fashion. As soon as\r\nhis facsimile left the room, his mind made the adjustment and it was as\r\nif it were really he strolling nonchalantly down the corridor.\r\n\r\nHe drove to a florist\'s shop and started to purchase a corsage.\r\nAbashed, he caught himself. He rushed out of the shop and went home to\r\nput a wallet and handkerchief into his pockets. He would have to be\r\nmore careful, he realized. Slips like that might cost him the contest.\r\n\r\nWith corsage box in hand, he pressed the door bell and waited. He hoped\r\nhis plastic flesh was moulded perfectly. It looked all right to him,\r\nbut you never could tell what someone else might notice. Myrna opened\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShe was lovely and he took her in his arms. Drawing back, he looked at\r\nher dubiously. 

At least, he thought it was she. His family, her family,\r\nand two or three others, acting as judges and referees in the contest,\r\nstood in the living room watching them. They began to laugh as they saw\r\nhis questioning look. 

It really was rather funny, he decided. Myrna\r\nled him into the room and introduced him to the few he didn\'t know.\r\n\r\nHe watched her closely as she opened the box. He thought her fingers\r\nwere fumbling a bit. Everyone in the room watched the two of them\r\nintently. They didn\'t know whether the couple were real or robot\r\neither. At any moment, she might suddenly try to identify him. Maybe he\r\nshould take the first chance. She might be fumbling from nervousness,\r\nhe realized. If it were really she and he called her a robot, she might\r\nbe offended. Girls were like that, but of course, he would have to take\r\nthat chance.\r\n\r\n"You\'re a robot," he announced suddenly.\r\n\r\nMyrna looked surprised. "Oh, how did you know?" She was crestfallen.\r\nHe was congratulated as they all trooped upstairs to help Myrna out of\r\nher harness. Later it was nice to know for sure that it was really her\r\nliving flesh in his arms. Then he felt guilty as he realized she was\r\nnot in his living arms. He excused himself hurriedly and returned home.\r\n\r\nThe next evening he was invited to Myrna\'s home for dinner. He thought\r\nof actually going himself because he knew the food would be good. The\r\napparatus could transmit heat, cold, and pressure, but it didn\'t do\r\nmuch when it came to taste and it couldn\'t make any sensation in one\'s\r\ninterior.\r\n\r\nBut he decided it would be too risky. If she identified his facsimile\r\nshe would win a point to be sure, but if she identified his real self,\r\nwell, that would end the contest and he would have to wait a year to\r\nget married.\r\n\r\nHe would have to be careful of the food though. She might try to trick\r\nhim with something that looked good but tasted terrible, and his\r\nfacsimile would eat it just the same.\r\n\r\nThat night before sending his proxy to Myrna\'s dinner party, he had his\r\nfacsimile stick himself with a pin. The sharp pain made him wince. 

He\r\nwondered about the mechanics of the machine. He supposed that his pain\r\nwas caused by a tiny electrical shock that stimulated a pain nerve. He\r\nrealized that the more he could find out about his equipment the better\r\nhis chances were of winning.\r\n\r\nThat evening Myrna was very watchful and very cool. He wondered if she\r\nsuspected that she had been loved by a robot the evening before. He had\r\nhardly seated himself at the table when she called him a robot. The\r\nfamilies seemed uproariously amused. 

He wondered how she had known. He\r\ncongratulated her politely and she was allowed to go unidentified since\r\nit was her round.\r\n\r\nWhen his facsimile was brought back to the room, Thad climbed wearily\r\nout of his harness and made himself a cold, uninteresting supper. He\r\nfelt lonely. Was Myrna really sore at him? Damn this whole business! He\r\nwished he didn\'t have to go through all of this.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next evening he had a plan worked out. He went himself and greeted\r\nher at the door, slammed it shut, and bent towards her to listen. It\r\nwould take a moment for the reverberation to reach her room. If she\r\nwere a robot, the sound would come through the primary microphone\r\nin the sender and he might be able to hear the faint echo from her\r\nlips. He did, and he immediately announced her as a facsimile. Her\r\ncongratulations were hardly more than civil.\r\n\r\nHe left with no great feeling of triumph.\r\n\r\nThe next three evenings, she was very distant. He understood why she\r\ndidn\'t meet him at the door anymore, but he couldn\'t tell why the rest\r\nof her behavior was so cold. She was very lucky, too. She identified\r\nhim correctly as a robot each time before he even had time to greet\r\nthe rest of the family. The day went very slowly. Thad left the office\r\nearly in his uneasiness. Tonight was the seventh and last situation.\r\nHe hoped it also wouldn\'t be their last evening together. At this\r\npoint, he hardly knew what to do. If she won the contest, it would be a\r\nwhole long year before they could marry. He knew that quite often that\r\nspelled the finish to a romance. On the other hand, if he won, it might\r\nestrange them immediately. She had such pride. What to do?\r\n\r\nHe decided to forget the robots and go as his real self again. Points\r\nwere in her favor anyway. He realized that if she were present by\r\nfacsimile, he couldn\'t possibly win. He might as well be the first\r\none to guess and be done with it. It wasn\'t the contest that mattered\r\nanyhow; it was Myrna and what she was feeling.\r\n\r\nWhen he rang the doorbell that evening, the corsage box under his arm\r\ncontained orchids. Unexpectedly, it was Myrna that opened the door.\r\n\r\n"Hello, _real_ Myrna."\r\n\r\nShe hesitated for a moment. "Good evening, Thad. Please come in."\r\n\r\nHe followed her in and greeted the family. She opened the box and for\r\na moment she seemed impressed. Then she regained her composure. He\r\naccepted her formal thanks as the families milled around admiring the\r\ngift. Everyone seemed slightly restrained. Thad finally phrased the\r\nquestion that they were all thinking.\r\n\r\n"Are you real?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you could tell if you kissed me," she said with mocking\r\nsweetness.\r\n\r\n"Myrna, I\'m sorry about that first evening, but I forgot that I wasn\'t\r\nreally there." He wished the family wasn\'t there so close. All of them\r\nwatching and listening made him feel an even greater uneasiness. Oh, he\r\nthought, the hell with this contest!\r\n\r\n"Myrna, honey, look, I don\'t care if it\'s really you or not. Well, that\r\nis, I mean--"\r\n\r\nHis voice faded out. He realized he was getting more confused. Someone\r\nsnickered. Myrna was watching him with a contemptuous smile curving her\r\nlips. The whole thing suddenly made him mad.\r\n\r\n"O.K.! I don\'t care who wins the contest! I don\'t care if we do have to\r\nwait a year. 

I don\'t even care at the moment if there\'s going to be a\r\nwedding or not.

"\r\n\r\nHe started out of the room dimly aware that he was angrier than he\r\nrealized. Myrna caught him in the vestibule.\r\n\r\n"Thad! Thad! 

Wait! 

Please, I know I was being spiteful. You won the\r\ncontest, I\'m really me. Please don\'t go like this. I\'d never forgive\r\nmyself."\r\n\r\nShe looked up at him tearfully. 

He felt himself relenting finally and\r\nsmiled. She threw her arms around his neck and he drew her close.\r\n\r\nAfter a very long kiss, she looked up at him and said softly, "Thad,\r\nlet\'s be sure the robots are all sent back to the agency before our\r\nhoneymoon."\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


And the awakening\r\nhad not brought the reassurance that it had all been a bad dream. That\r\nif it had happened in reality, the people of Earth would have been\r\ncapable of dealing with the terrible menace. 

It had been real. And they\r\nhad been no more capable of resisting the giant intelligences than a\r\nchild of killing the ogre in his favorite fairy story.\r\n\r\nIt was an ironic parallel, because that was what finally saved Earth for\r\nits own people. A fairy story.\r\n\r\nThe old fable of the lion and the mouse. When the lion had exhausted his\r\natomic armor and proud science against the invincible and immortal\r\ninvaders of Earth--for they could not be killed by any means--the mouse\r\nattacked and vanquished them.\r\n\r\nThe mouse, the lowest form of life: the fungoids, the air of Earth\r\nswarming with millions of their spores, attacked the monstrous bodies,\r\ngrew and entwined within the gray convolutions that were their brain\r\ncenters. And as the tiny thread-roots probed and tightened, the aliens\r\nscreamed soundlessly. The intelligences toppled and fell, and at last\r\nthat few among them who retained sanity gathered their lunatic brethren\r\nand fled as they had come.\r\n\r\nIf he had known the effect the fungoids would have on them, he would\r\nhave told them that too. He had told them everything else, when he had\r\nbeen snatched from a busy city street, a random specimen of humanity to\r\nbe probed and investigated.\r\n\r\nThey had chosen well. For the payment they offered him he was willing to\r\nbarter the whole human race. As far as it lay in his power he did just\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nHe was not an educated man, though he was intelligent. It was child\'s\r\nplay to them to strip his mind bare; but they had to know the\r\nintangibles too, the determined will of humanity to survive, the\r\nprobabilities of the pattern of human behavior in a situation which\r\nhumanity had never before faced. He told them all he could, gladly and\r\nwillingly. 

He would have descended to any treachery for the vast\r\nglittering reward they tempted him with.\r\n\r\nIt wasn\'t easy for the Yugoslavs to guard him and, anyway, their hearts\r\nweren\'t in the task. His treachery, the ultimate treason, the betrayal\r\nof the whole human race, was commonly known.\r\n\r\nInevitably the mob got him and killed three policemen in the process.\r\nWhen they had sated their anger a little and the traitor had lost most\r\nof his clothes and the thumb of his right hand, they dragged him to the\r\njunction where the Danube meets the Sava and held him under the gray\r\nwaters with long poles, as if he was some poisonous reptile.\r\n\r\nHe lay supinely on the bed of the river and smiled evilly while a\r\nhundred thousand people writhed in neural agony.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwenty-four hours later the neural plague had spread to Zagreb and into\r\nAlbania as far as Tirana. When it crossed to Leghorn in Italy the\r\nBalkans held twenty million lunatics and the Danube was an artificial\r\nlake a hundred miles wide.\r\n\r\nThey had used a "clean" bomb. So they were able to bring a loudspeaker\r\nvan to its edge and boom at him to come out. He allowed them to do that\r\nfor some inscrutable reason; perhaps to demonstrate that his powers were\r\nselective. Then it seemed he got tired of the farce, and cruel fingers\r\ntwined themselves into the nerve centers of the President of Italy and\r\nthe Prime Minister of the government of United Europe. He made them\r\ndance a horribly twisted _pas de deux_ on the banks of the Danube for\r\nhis perverted amusement.\r\n\r\nThen he released them, and released the millions of gibbering, twitching\r\nidiots that inhabited Southern Europe, and he came out of the river bed\r\nin which he had lain for forty-eight hours.\r\n\r\nHe walked alone through the deserted streets of Belgrade until he came\r\nto the United Nations building. There he told a very brave lieutenant\r\nthat he was willing to stand trial any place in the world they wished.\r\n\r\nFor three days nobody came to arrest him. He sat alone with the\r\nlieutenant in the peopleless city of Belgrade and waited for his\r\ncaptors. 

They came then, timidly reassured by his non-violence. 

While he\r\ntalked to them pleasantly the citizens of London and Paris suddenly\r\nbegan to dance jerky and grotesque jigs on the pavements of their\r\ncities. In the same moment the Chief Justice of the Court of the\r\nNations, at a cocktail party in Washington, writhed in the exquisite\r\npain of total muscle cramp, his august features twisted into a mask of\r\nabject fear.\r\n\r\nThe trial itself was a legal farce. The prisoner promptly pleaded guilty\r\nto the charge of betraying mankind to an alien race, but he didn\'t allow\r\nthem to question him. When one lawyer persisted in face of his pleasant\r\nrefusals, he died suddenly in a cramped ball of screaming agony.\r\n\r\nThe gray-faced Chief Justice inquired whether he wished to be sentenced\r\nand he answered yes, but not to death. They couldn\'t kill him, he\r\nexplained. 

That was part of the reward the aliens had given him. The\r\nother part was that _he_ could kill or immobilize anybody in the\r\nworld--or everybody--from any distance. He sat back and smiled at the\r\nstricken courtroom. Then he lost his composure and his mouth twitched.\r\nHe laughed uproariously and slapped his knees in ecstasy.\r\n\r\nIt was plain that he was fond of a joke.\r\n\r\nAn anonymous lawyer stood up and waited patiently for his merriment to\r\nsubside.\r\n\r\nIf this was true, he asked, why had not the aliens used this power? Why\r\nhad they not simply killed off the inhabitants and taken over the vacant\r\nplanet? 

The traitor gazed kindly at him; and a court stenographer who\r\nhad cautiously picked up a pencil returned agonizingly to her foetal\r\nposition and, that way, died.\r\n\r\nThe traitor looked at his fingers and shrugged. The thumb that had been\r\nsnapped off in the mob\'s frenzy was more than half grown again.\r\n\r\n"They needed slaves," he said simply.\r\n\r\n"And at the end, while some of them were still sane?"\r\n\r\nThe traitor raised his eyebrows, giving him his full courteous\r\nattention. The lawyer sat down abruptly, his question unfinished. The\r\ncreature who had betrayed his own race smiled at him and permitted him\r\nto live.\r\n\r\nHe even completed his question for him, and answered it. "Why did they\r\nnot kill then? They had something else on their minds--fungoids!" He\r\nlaughed uproariously at his macabre joke. 

"And in their minds too!"\r\n\r\nThe lawyer\'s blue eyes gazed at him steadily and he stopped laughing. In\r\nthe bated hush of the courtroom he said softly, "What a pity I\'m not an\r\nalien too. You could have the fungoids destroy me!"\r\n\r\nHe laughed again helplessly, the tears running down his cheeks.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Chief Justice adjourned the Court then and the prisoner sauntered to\r\nhis comfortable quarters in front of his frightened guards.\r\n\r\nThat night, in his own living room, the Chief Justice danced an agonized\r\nfandango in front of his horror-stricken wife and the anonymous lawyer\r\nsat in his apartment, staring at the blank wall. He was glad the aliens\r\nhad not made the traitor telepathic too.\r\n\r\nHe had found the chink in his armor.\r\n\r\nThe neural paralysis, the murders by remote control, were acts of a\r\nconscious will. He had himself admitted that if his mind was destroyed\r\nhis powers would be destroyed with it. The aliens had not sought revenge\r\nbecause their minds were totally occupied with saving themselves. The\r\nstricken ones had simply lost the power.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge was useless to him. There was no way they could attack his\r\nmind without his knowing it.\r\n\r\nPossibly they could steal away his consciousness by drugging or\r\nbludgeoning, but it would be racial suicide to attempt it. In the split\r\nmoment of realization he would kill every human being on Earth. There\r\nwould be nobody left to operate on his brain, to make him a mindless,\r\npowerless idiot for the rest of time. For any period of time, he\r\ncorrected himself. His brain would heal again.\r\n\r\nIt was useless to think about it. There was nothing they could use\r\nagainst his invincibility. The only hope was to attack him unawares ...\r\nand if that hope was a fraction less than a certainty it could only mean\r\nfinal and absolute catastrophe.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer looked at his watch. It was four in the morning.\r\n\r\nHe went into the kitchenette and then shrugged himself into his coat. He\r\nwalked through the silent streets, past the city hospital where the\r\nChief Justice lay in agony while the motor impulses from his nerve\r\ncenters wrenched and twisted his body. He entered the foyer of the\r\nluxury hotel where the race betrayer was held prisoner and took the\r\nelevator to the sixth floor.\r\n\r\nTwo sleepy guards jerked erect outside the unlocked door. He put his\r\nfinger to his lips, enjoining them to silence. Then he entered the room\r\nand stood for a moment over the man who was invincible and immortal--and\r\nhuman. Human, and subject to the involuntary unconsciousness which\r\nnature demands from all men. He slept.\r\n\r\nThe eyelids fluttered. The lawyer took the steel meat skewer from his\r\npocket. He thrust it through a half-opened eye and rotated it,\r\nmethodically reducing the soft brain to formless mush.\r\n\r\nAfter that the trial proceeded normally.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner stared vacantly in front of him and all his movements had\r\nto be directed. But he was alive and his thumb was full grown again.\r\n\r\nIt was the lawyer that noticed this and pointed out the implications.\r\nThe thumb had grown to full size in less than six weeks. They must\r\nregard that as their maximum period of immunity.\r\n\r\nThey ruminated over it for another four days. The question was a tricky\r\none, for malignant immortality was beyond human solution. It was not\r\njust a matter of dealing out punishment. The problem now was the\r\nprotection of the race from sudden annihilation. An insolvable problem,\r\nbut one that must be solved. They could only do their best.\r\n\r\nHe was sentenced to life imprisonment, with a special feature.\r\n\r\nIt was decided he should be guillotined once a month as long as he\r\nlived.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n


]\r\n\r\n\r\nThey climbed the hill together, arm in arm. At the crest, they stopped\r\nand looked back into the moon-brightened valley where the thin needle\r\nof metal pointed skyward.\r\n\r\nThe night wind blew her dress tightly about her slim legs, and she\r\nreached a hand to her head to keep the blonde curls from whipping about\r\nher face.\r\n\r\nHe put his arm about her waist, squeezed her gently. "Only a few more\r\nhours to wait," he said, reassuringly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe great ship from beyond the Galaxy drew alongside the tiny planet,\r\nmatched its orbit, cut its drive, and drifted slightly toward the lone\r\nmoon. The ship was nearly as large as the planet itself, but there was\r\nno interchange of gravity between the two bodies, for the ship was of a\r\nsubstance made beyond the stars.\r\n\r\nInspector Ryt looked at his sky chart. Yes, it was Sol III. Then he\r\nlooked through the port hole at his left and adjusted the lens. Then he\r\nswore by the Seven Sister Suns of Sagittarius.\r\n\r\nThe lens showed him the moonlit side of the planet. There were lights\r\nthere, little rows of lights forming checkered patterns in various\r\nareas. And there were other lights, greater lights which flickered\r\nviciously among the patterns, leaving squat, circular clouds above them.\r\n\r\nRyt\'s cheeks puffed out in uncontrollable wrath. "Contaminated!" he\r\nbellowed. "And they are warring on each other!"\r\n\r\nHe turned from the lens, his gross body glowing in red anger.\r\n"Krembyl!" he screamed. "Krembyl!"\r\n\r\nThe door at the far side of the room swung open, and the entity called\r\nKrembyl fluttered in. 

"Yes?" he asked, his body trembling at the manner\r\nin which his name had rung out.\r\n\r\n"Your records show Sol III as sterile. Decontaminated!"\r\n\r\n"Y-yes, sir," Krembyl stammered. "I--I took care of it myself. Just\r\na--a few days ago...."\r\n\r\n"Look!" shouted Inspector Ryt. "Look for yourself!"\r\n\r\nKrembyl went hesitantly to the lens and adjusted himself before it. He\r\nsaw the sparkling lights below, the flashes, the tiny clouds, and his\r\nbody went pale pink with the shame of defeat.\r\n\r\n"I--I am sorry, sir." He turned from the instrument, his pale pink\r\nfading to an ashen gray. 

"I just don\'t understand it. I have renovated\r\nthe planet several times...."\r\n\r\n"_Several times?_"\r\n\r\n"Why, y-yes." Krembyl hurried to a shelf of documents along one wall,\r\nscanned the titles briefly selected one, and returned to the desk.\r\n"Here it is, sir. You will find my reports quite in order, sir."\r\n\r\n"Damn the reports!" snapped the inspector. "I want to know why this\r\nplanet hasn\'t been cared for properly!" He darkened his body with a\r\nscowl.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKrembyl fumbled the document open, flipped a few pages. "Here it is,\r\nsir. All written down, sir. All in correct order, sir.\r\n\r\n"_Cosmos 66, 9238_," he read. "_Malignant growth noted._\r\n\r\n"_Cosmos 67, 9238 Decontamination process begun._\r\n\r\n"_Method: Entire planet encircled with electrical impulses which caused\r\nhydrogen and oxygen to unite into a heavy liquid. Process continued for\r\na full 40 of planet revolutions._\r\n\r\n"_Result: Planet covered with the liquid to an average depth of 30\r\nfathoms. Contaminating element, being oxygen-breathing, could not\r\npossibly exist under such conditions._"\r\n\r\n"Fool!" barked Ryt. "Some of them probably floated to the surface on\r\nsome of the buoyant vegetation. They may even have made rafts of the\r\nvegetation. Or a boat!"\r\n\r\n"They are exceedingly persistent and adaptable, sir," Krembyl admitted.\r\n"And there were other times...." He broke off to fumble through the\r\ndocumented account. "Yes, here it is, all written down in correct\r\nform...."\r\n\r\n"Damn the reports!" snapped the inspector. "Tell me what happened!"\r\n\r\n"Well, sir," said Krembyl, scanning the pages carefully, "it was back\r\nin 9237. I noticed the malignancy and took proper measures. I took\r\nthe planet from its orbit and into an area remote from the Sol unit.\r\nThere, in the intense cold, the polar caps grew larger and larger until\r\nthey finally extended over the land portions. Even the middle belt\r\nbecame frigid. Then I swung the planet back near Sol and let it soak in\r\ntropical heat. I subjected the planet to this treatment three--or was\r\nit four?--times before placing it back permanently in its orbit."\r\n\r\n"Dolt!" said Ryt. 

"They probably hid away in deep crevices. Probably\r\nremained alive through the treatment by eating each other!" He looked\r\nat the unhappy Krembyl for a devastating minute. "You should have used\r\nfire. _Burned them out!_"\r\n\r\n"But I _did_, sir!" Krembyl said, hurriedly. "I _did_!" He fumbled\r\nrapidly through the pages. "Here it is, right here! All written out!\r\n\r\n"_Nebula 42, 9235. Persistence of malignant contamination noted...._"\r\n\r\nHe broke off abruptly as the inspector\'s body turned to brittle\r\nobsidion.\r\n\r\n"H-m-mm.... A-hh.... Well, sir, finding them confined in an area of\r\nparticularly lush vegetation, I burned them out, chased them with fire\r\ninto arid regions, and swept the garden of plant growth completely away\r\nwhere they could not find it again."\r\n\r\n"But it is obvious that you failed! 

Even if two of them succeeded in\r\nescaping...."\r\n\r\n"And before that, sir," Krembyl hurried on. "Before that, I shook the\r\nland masses violently, rent great fissures that permitted the gasses\r\nand flames to leap out from the central core and spread destruction. I\r\nsubmerged huge infected areas into the depths of the seas, and brought\r\nup new land masses, fresh and clean, into the light of Sol. I even...."\r\n\r\n"Enough! 

Enough!" Ryt hit the desk before him a ponderous blow.\r\n"Silence, fool, while I think!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKrembyl turned a sickly shade of green and let the document close in\r\nweary hands.\r\n\r\nSol III had been a particularly painful lancet in his side, even more\r\nso than had yet been guessed. He hoped the inspector would probe no\r\ndeeper. 

But even as his hopes kindled, they became but ashes.\r\n\r\n"There are a few more things I do not understand about this," Inspector\r\nRyt was saying. "When this planet was formed from the elements of\r\nspace, there was no contamination. It was virgin. 

And, yet, it is now\r\ncontaminated. 

Why?"\r\n\r\nKrembyl felt his inners churning fearfully. His whole body was so\r\nfilled with trembling that he could not bring himself to fashion words.\r\n\r\nRyt\'s body grew blacker in the silence. "_Why?_" The word was lightning\r\nfrom the Stygian depths. "WHY?"\r\n\r\nKrembyl\'s body rent asunder, and the effort of reknitting himself so\r\nweakened him that his voice was scarcely a whisper. "They--they came\r\nfrom Sol V, sir."\r\n\r\nThe thunderous blow upon the desk top mingled with Ryt\'s bellow of\r\nfury. Together, the sounds shook the room and nearly disintegrated\r\nKrembyl\'s hastily reassembled body.\r\n\r\n"Dolt! Ass!" screamed Ryt, his body assuming the blackness of the dust\r\ncloud of Orion. "You failed to stop them on Sol V! You not only let\r\nthem blow the planet into tiny bits, but you also let them escape to\r\nSol III! And here all your efforts of extermination have failed again\r\nand again!"\r\n\r\nHe wheeled to look through the lens again. Three brilliant flashes,\r\ngreater than the others, sparkled almost simultaneously upon the\r\nplanet\'s troubled surface, sent up mushrooms of dust and shattered\r\natoms. "And is this what happened on Sol V?"\r\n\r\n"Y-yes," stammered Krembyl. 

"The same thing. Just before ... just\r\nbefore...."\r\n\r\nHe could not bring himself to complete the statement.\r\n\r\nRyt leaped from the seat at the desk, his body black and bloated.\r\n"Then there is not a moment to lose! Exterminate before this planet is\r\ndestroyed! And let none escape!"\r\n\r\n"But, sir," pleaded Krembyl, "I have tried everything--fire, floods,\r\nice...."\r\n\r\n"Then try something else!" Ryt roared.\r\n\r\nKrembyl drifted slowly towards the door.\r\n\r\n"Wait!"\r\n\r\nKrembyl stopped obediently.\r\n\r\n"What about Sol IV?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Sol IV is all right, sir." Krembyl brightened a shade as he\r\nturned. "There is not the slightest trace of contamination. That planet\r\nmust have been on the far side of Sol when--when they escaped Sol V.\r\nI am certain, sir, you will find the rest of the system quite in\r\norder...."\r\n\r\n"Enough! Begin the extermination! And this time employ drastic\r\nmeasures. Take the planet to the rim of Sol itself and bake it to a\r\ncrisp before they infest the entire galaxy."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir. 

Immediately, sir." Krembyl turned again to the door,\r\nthankful his fate had not been worse.\r\n\r\n"And don\'t fail this time!" warned Ryt. "If you lose Sol III as you\r\nlost Sol V, I\'ll see to it that you put them both back together again,\r\npiece by piece, if it takes you six eons beyond your retirement age!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe moon, with its strange accompanying cloud, had nearly set. The blue\r\nof the eastern sky was fading into apple-green. There was a roaring\r\nswish of sound, a shattering blast of energy, a whistling sigh, then\r\na remote whisper. The needle-like structure from the valley became a\r\nflickering pin point in the sky.\r\n\r\nThe girl leaned her blonde head against the shoulder of the man beside\r\nher. "We--we are free?" Her voice was but a whisper.\r\n\r\nHe adjusted the ra-vis to get a clearer view of Earth and its\r\nsurrounding space. The view was but slightly distorted by the hot gases\r\nof the stern tubes. "Yes," he said, struggling to keep his nervousness\r\nfrom playing havoc with his vocal cords. "Free. 

Free from a mad world!"\r\nHe squeezed her hand reassuringly, his eyes intent upon the screen.\r\n\r\nSomething had gone wrong. The earth had slid to one edge of the screen.\r\nHe readjusted the ra-vis. The space-cloud of black that had hovered\r\nnear the moon that night had also shifted its position. It was now\r\nbetween the earth and the sun, and the earth seemed to be following\r\nit.... The furrow between his dark brows deepened, but he said nothing.\r\n\r\n"Just think of it!" she said, her voice a song. "Mars! And a brave new\r\nworld!"\r\n\r\nHe put an arm about her shoulders and took his eyes from the screen.\r\nIt was absurd to think the earth was moving sunward. It was probably\r\nmerely due to some space aberration....\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said, picking up her enthusiasm. "And after that--the\r\n_stars_!"\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                This is how it all began--the terrible\r\n                civil strife that devastates our world!\r\n\r\n\r\n    Based in material in Ch. 

7--"First Clashes of the Wheeled and\r\n    Footed Sects"--of Vol. 3 of Burger\'s monumental _History of\r\n    Traffic_, published by the Foundation for Twenty-Second\r\n    Century Studies.\r\n\r\nThe raggedy little old lady with the big shopping bag was in the exact\r\ncenter of the crosswalk when she became aware of the big black car\r\nbearing down on her.\r\n\r\nBehind the thick bullet-proof glass its seven occupants had a misty\r\nlook, like men in a diving bell.\r\n\r\nShe saw there was no longer time to beat the car to either curb.\r\nVeering remorselessly, it would catch her in the gutter.\r\n\r\nUseless to attempt a feint and double-back, such as any venturesome\r\nchild executed a dozen times a day. Her reflexes were too slow.\r\n\r\nPolite vacuous laughter came from the car\'s loudspeaker over the\r\nengine\'s mounting roar.\r\n\r\nFrom her fellow pedestrians lining the curbs came a sigh of horror.\r\n\r\nThe little old lady dipped into her shopping bag and came up with a big\r\nblue-black automatic. She held it in both fists, riding the recoils\r\nlike a rodeo cowboy on a bucking bronco.\r\n\r\nAiming at the base of the windshield, just as a big-game hunter aims\r\nat the vulnerable spine of a charging water buffalo over the horny\r\narmor of its lowered head, the little old lady squeezed off three shots\r\nbefore the car chewed her down.\r\n\r\nFrom the right-hand curb a young woman in a wheelchair shrieked an\r\nobscenity at the car\'s occupants.\r\n\r\nSmythe-de Winter, the driver, wasn\'t happy. The little old lady\'s\r\nlast shot had taken two members of his car pool. Bursting through the\r\nlaminated glass, the steel-jacketed slug had traversed the neck of\r\nPhipps-McHeath and buried itself in the skull of Horvendile-Harker.\r\n\r\nBraking viciously, Smythe-de Winter rammed the car over the right-hand\r\ncurb. Pedestrians scattered into entries and narrow arcades, among them\r\na youth bounding high on crutches.\r\n\r\nBut Smythe-de Winter got the girl in the wheelchair.\r\n\r\nThen he drove rapidly out of the Slum Ring into the Suburbs, a shred\r\nof rattan swinging from the flange of his right fore mudguard for\r\na trophy. Despite the two-for-two casualty list, he felt angry and\r\ndepressed. The secure, predictable world around him seemed to be\r\ncrumbling.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile his companions softly keened a dirge to Horvy and Phipps and\r\nquietly mopped up their blood, he frowned and shook his head.\r\n\r\n"They oughtn\'t to let old ladies carry magnums," he murmured.\r\n\r\nWitherspoon-Hobbs nodded agreement across the front-seat corpse. "They\r\noughtn\'t to let \'em carry anything. 

God, how I hate Feet," he muttered,\r\nlooking down at his shrunken legs. "Wheels forever!" he softly cheered.\r\n\r\nThe incident had immediate repercussions throughout the city. At the\r\ncombined wake of the little old lady and the girl in the wheelchair,\r\na fiery-tongued speaker inveighed against the White-Walled Fascists\r\nof Suburbia, telling to his hearers, the fabled wonders of old Los\r\nAngeles, where pedestrians were sacrosanct, even outside crosswalks. He\r\ncalled for a hobnail march across the nearest lawn-bowling alleys and\r\nperambulator-traversed golf courses of the motorists.\r\n\r\nAt the Sunnyside Crematorium, to which the bodies of Phipps and Horvy\r\nhad been conveyed, an equally impassioned and rather more grammatical\r\norator reminded his listeners of the legendary justice of old Chicago,\r\nwhere pedestrians were forbidden to carry small arms and anyone with\r\none foot off the sidewalk was fair prey. He broadly hinted that a\r\nholocaust, primed if necessary with a few tankfuls of gasoline, was the\r\nonly cure for the Slums.\r\n\r\nBands of skinny youths came loping at dusk out of the Slum Ring into\r\nthe innermost sections of the larger doughnut of the Suburbs slashing\r\ndefenseless tires, shooting expensive watchdogs and scrawling filthy\r\nwords on the pristine panels of matrons\' runabouts which never ventured\r\nmore than six blocks from home.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously squadrons of young suburban motorcycles and scooterites\r\nroared through the outermost precincts of the Slum Ring, harrying\r\nchildren off sidewalks, tossing stink-bombs through second-story\r\ntenement windows and defacing hovel-fronts with sprays of black paint.\r\n\r\nIncident--a thrown brick, a cut corner, monster tacks in the portico\r\nof the Auto Club--were even reported from the center of the city,\r\ntraditionally neutral territory.\r\n\r\nThe Government hurriedly acted, suspending all traffic between the\r\nCenter and the Suburbs and establishing a 24-hour curfew in the Slum\r\nRing. Government agents moved only by centipede-car and pogo-hopper to\r\nunderline the point that they favored neither contending side.\r\n\r\nThe day of enforced non-movement for Feet and Wheels was spent in\r\nfurtive vengeful preparations. 

Behind locked garage doors, machine-guns\r\nthat fired through the nose ornament were mounted under hoods, illegal\r\nscythe blades were welded to oversize hubcaps and the stainless steel\r\nedges of flange fenders were honed to razor sharpness.\r\n\r\nWhile nervous National Guardsmen hopped about the deserted sidewalks of\r\nthe Slum Ring, grim-faced men and women wearing black armbands moved\r\nthrough the webwork of secret tunnels and hidden doors, distributing\r\nheavy-caliber small arms and spike-studded paving blocks, piling\r\ncobblestones on strategic roof-tops and sapping upward from the secret\r\ntunnels to create car-traps. Children got ready to soap intersections\r\nafter dark. The Committee of Pedestrian Safety, sometimes known as\r\nRobespierre\'s Rats, prepared to release its two carefully hoarded\r\nanti-tank guns.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt nightfall, under the tireless urging of the Government,\r\nrepresentatives of the Pedestrians and the Motorists met on a huge\r\nsafety island at the boundary of the Slum Ring and the Suburbs.\r\n\r\nUnderlings began a noisy dispute as to whether Smythe-de Winter had\r\nfailed to give a courtesy honk before charging, whether the little old\r\nlady had opened fire before the car had come within honking distance,\r\nhow many wheels of Smythe-de\'s car had been on the sidewalk when he hit\r\nthe girl in the wheelchair and so on. After a little while the High\r\nPedestrian and the Chief Motorist exchanged cautious winks and drew\r\naside.\r\n\r\nThe red writhing of a hundred kerosene flares and the mystic yellow\r\npulsing of a thousand firefly lamps mounted on yellow sawhorses ranged\r\naround the safety island illumined two tragic, strained faces.\r\n\r\n"A word before we get down to business," the Chief Motorist whispered.\r\n"What\'s the current S.Q. of your adults?

"\r\n\r\n"Forty-one and dropping," the High Pedestrian replied, his eyes\r\nfearfully searching from side to side for eavesdroppers. "I can hardly\r\nget aides who are halfway _compos mentis_."\r\n\r\n"Our own Sanity Quotient is thirty-seven," the Chief Motorist revealed.\r\nHe shrugged helplessly.... "The wheels inside my people\'s heads are\r\nslowing down. I do not think they will be speeded up in my lifetime."\r\n\r\n"They say Government\'s only fifty-two," the other said with a matching\r\nshrug.\r\n\r\n"Well, I suppose we must scrape out one more compromise," the one\r\nsuggested hollowly, "though I must confess there are times when I think\r\nwe\'re all the figments of a paranoid\'s dream."\r\n\r\nTwo hours of concentrated deliberations produced the new Wheel-Foot\r\nArticles of Agreement. Among other points, pedestrian handguns were\r\nlimited to a slightly lower muzzle velocity and to .38 caliber and\r\nunder, while motorists were required to give three honks at one block\r\ndistance before charging a pedestrian in a crosswalk. Two wheels over\r\nthe curb changed a traffic kill from third-degree manslaughter to petty\r\nhomicide. Blind pedestrians were permitted to carry hand grenades.\r\n\r\nImmediately the Government went to work. The new Wheel-Foot Articles\r\nwere loudspeakered and posted. Detachments of police and psychiatric\r\nsocial hoppers centipedaled and pogoed through the Slum Ring, seizing\r\noutsize weapons and giving tranquilizing jet-injections to the unruly.\r\nTeams of hypnotherapists and mechanics scuttled from home to home\r\nin the Suburbs and from garage to garage, in-chanting a conformist\r\nserenity and stripping illegal armament from cars. On the advice of\r\na rogue psychiatrist, who said it would channel off aggressions, a\r\ndisplay of bull-fighting was announced, but this had to be canceled\r\nwhen a strong protest was lodged by the Decency League, which had a\r\nlarge mixed Wheel-Foot membership.\r\n\r\nAt dawn, curfew was lifted in the Slum Ring and traffic reopened\r\nbetween the Suburbs and the Center. After a few uneasy moments it\r\nbecame apparent that the _status quo_ had been restored.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSmythe-de Winter tooled his gleaming black machine along the Ring. A\r\nthick steel bolt with a large steel washer on either side neatly filled\r\nthe hole the little old lady\'s slug had made in the windshield.\r\n\r\nA brick bounced off the roof. Bullets pattered against the side\r\nwindows.\r\n\r\nSmythe-de ran a handkerchief around his neck under his collar and\r\nsmiled.\r\n\r\nA block ahead children were darting into the street, cat-calling and\r\nthumbing their noses. Behind one of them limped a fat dog with a spiked\r\ncollar.\r\n\r\nSmythe-de suddenly gunned his motor. He didn\'t hit any of the children,\r\nbut he got the dog.\r\n\r\nA flashing light on the dash showed him the right front tire was losing\r\npressure. 

Must have hit the collar as well! He thumbed the matching\r\nemergency-air button and the flashing stopped.\r\n\r\nHe turned toward Witherspoon-Hobbs and said with thoughtful\r\nsatisfaction, "I like a normal orderly world, where you always have a\r\nlittle success, but not champagne-heady; a little failure, but just\r\nenough to brace you."\r\n\r\nWitherspoon-Hobbs was squinting at the next crosswalk. Its center was\r\ndiscolored by a brownish stain ribbon-tracked by tires.\r\n\r\n"That\'s where you bagged the little old lady, Smythe-de," he remarked.\r\n"I\'ll say this for her now: she had spirit."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that\'s where I bagged her," Smythe-de agreed flatly. He\r\nremembered wistfully the witchlike face growing rapidly larger, her\r\njerking shoulders in black bombazine, the wild white-circled eyes. He\r\nsuddenly found himself feeling that this was a very dull day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


But could he smuggle himself aboard?\r\n\r\n\r\n            Illustrated by Lloyd Rognan\r\n\r\n\r\nDad had already gone when Bobby got up. This disappointed Bobby a little\r\nbut then he remembered--_this was the big day_. Naturally Dad would get\r\nover to the project early. And at four o\'clock-- Bobby shivered\r\ndeliciously at the thought of it.\r\n\r\nHe ate his breakfast in silence with Mom across the table drinking a cup\r\nof coffee and looking at a fashion catalogue. He was glad she was\r\noccupied because he didn\'t want to talk; not today he didn\'t. Might\r\nspill something secret. 

Might even let out the _big secret_. That would\r\nbe terrible.\r\n\r\nOf course, all things were secret at Buffalo Flats. So secret top\r\nscientists like Dad didn\'t even discuss them with wives like Mom. And\r\nwives like Mom never asked.\r\n\r\nSo it was really something to sit there eating breakfast knowing that,\r\ntoday, Dad was going to rocket to the Moon. And with Mom not even\r\nknowing the Lunar project was in the works, so naturally not dreaming\r\nthat he was going _with_ Dad! The thrill was overpowering.\r\n\r\nMaybe they would have radio communication after they got there and he\r\nwould call back and say, _Hello, Mom! Guess where I am? On the moon with\r\nDad!_ And Mom would say, _Why, Bobby! Scaring me to death like this! I\r\nwas looking all over for you._ Sounding very angry but not being really\r\nangry after all. Because maybe Dad would cut in and say, _Yeah, he\'s\r\nright here with me, dear. What do you think of this boy of ours?_\r\n\r\nBobby gulped the last of his cereal so he could go outside and wriggle\r\nfor joy. As he got up from his chair, Mom said, "And what\'s your plan\r\nfor today, young man? Davy Crockett or Buck Rogers?"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBobby had a quick thought--a sudden temptation. Why not give Mom a hint?\r\nWhy he could even _tell_ her and she still wouldn\'t know. Then later,\r\nafter he was gone, she would remember back and say, _That boy! When he\r\ntells you something he really means it._\r\n\r\nBobby smiled and said, "I think I\'ll go to the moon today."\r\n\r\nMom smiled too and went back to her fashions. "Well, see to it your fuel\r\nmixture is correct."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll check it. And Mom--I might not be home for lunch."\r\n\r\n"Where will you be?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know.

"\r\n\r\n"Well, mind your manners and say thank you when you leave."\r\n\r\nMrs. Kendall, still smiling, watched Bobby dash out into the yard.\r\nLiving on a restricted government area had one compensation at least.\r\nYou didn\'t have to worry about your children. Four dozen families, all\r\nwith offspring, trapped behind ten-foot patrolled fence. Here, nobody\r\nworried about their children. They came and went and at noon a mother\r\nfed whatever number happened to be in the house at the time. Mrs.\r\nKendall usually drew six or seven. It would be a relief to dodge the\r\nchore for one Saturday....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOut in the backyard, Bobby fussed around his space rocket a little:\r\ntightening a screw here--hammering in a nail there. Just until he could\r\nslip away without Mom noticing his direction.\r\n\r\nIt wasn\'t a bad rocket at that, he thought. Six feet long with two seats\r\nand a keen instrument panel. But kid stuff of course. After he found the\r\nway in through the sewer he hadn\'t paid any more attention to his own\r\nship.\r\n\r\nHe could see Mom through the window, back in her book, so he went\r\ncasually out through the back gate and turned left, kicking at pebbles\r\nas he sauntered along and trying to look as though he had no place to\r\ngo. Had to be careful. Didn\'t want to bump into any of the other kids\r\ntoday, either.\r\n\r\nThe way in through the sewer was at a place behind Laboratory B. There\r\nwas a kind of an alley there that nobody ever walked through and then\r\nthis round lid you could lift up and look under. And a ladder you could\r\nclimb down.\r\n\r\nBobby hadn\'t dared go down at first. But, after thinking about it\r\novernight, his curiosity won out and he went back and ducked down\r\ninto the lower level. He called it a sewer because of sewers being\r\nunderground, but this place was clean and had bunches of wires strung\r\nin every direction and faint little lights you could see by.\r\n\r\nBobby went further and further every trip he took, never telling anybody\r\nbecause you weren\'t supposed to talk about things at Buffalo Flats--not\r\neven to the other kids.\r\n\r\nThen he found the big drome where they were building the rocket. It was\r\nso sleek and beautiful and shiny that he just stared at it--up through\r\nthe grating in the floor that was for air circulation or something.\r\n\r\nHe didn\'t know it was the moon rocket at first. Not until he\'d gone back\r\nseveral times to peek up at it and then one day two scientists came\r\nwalking along right in front of his nose.\r\n\r\nOne of them was Dad.\r\n\r\nBobby almost called out but he caught himself and just listened to them\r\ntalking. This was the first time his conscience bothered him about going\r\nunderneath the drome. He thought about it a lot--whether it was the\r\nright thing to do. And while he was never able to still his conscience\r\ncompletely, he quieted down by saying he really wasn\'t doing any harm\r\nbecause he\'d never told anybody what he saw.\r\n\r\nHe learned the rocket was going to the moon by listening to Dad and the\r\nother scientists talk when they thought they were alone. And it was\r\nfunny. Because even there, they spoke in low voices and didn\'t give too\r\nmuch away.\r\n\r\nHe had known now for three days that at four o\'clock the roof would open\r\nand the drome would be turned into a blast-pit and the rocket would\r\nshoot out through space to the moon.\r\n\r\nThat was all he _did_ know for sure. None of the men had said who was\r\ngoing on the first trip to the moon. Nothing had been said on that\r\nsubject at all, but Bobby knew Dad would go. He would have to. After\r\nall, Dad was the second biggest scientist at Buffalo Flats. Second only\r\nto Schleimmer himself and Professor Schleimmer was very old and\r\ncertainly wouldn\'t make the trip. That left Dad. Dad would just have to\r\ngo in order to run the rocket. There probably wasn\'t anybody else smart\r\nenough in the whole place.\r\n\r\nThe idea of going himself had been born the previous day--when he found\r\na larger grating in the floor near the rocket and realized if he was\r\nvery careful he could climb out of the sewer and duck into the rocket\r\nwhen nobody was looking. Once inside he was pretty sure he\'d find a\r\nplace to hide until blast-off.\r\n\r\nAll the men would probably be strapped in bunks but if he found a place\r\nhe could wedge himself in he didn\'t think he\'d get hurt. Then, halfway\r\nto the moon he would come out and find Dad and would he be surprised!\r\n\r\nAt first, thinking about it, he\'d been scared but after he realized how\r\nproud Dad and Mom would be, he made up his mind.\r\n\r\nNow, crouched beside the grating near the ship, he waited while two\r\nmen--technicians in white overalls--walked by.\r\n\r\nOne of them said, "Well, whatever happens, she\'ll make a big splash."\r\n\r\n"You said it. 

Hope the brains know what they\'re doing."\r\n\r\nThat made Bobby mad. Who said Dad didn\'t know what he was doing? Dad was\r\njust about the smartest scientist in the world.\r\n\r\nAfter the two men left he waited a long time. He heard voices but no one\r\ncame in sight. Taking a deep breath, he opened the grating and got out.\r\nIt was only four steps to the open port of the rocket. There was a\r\nlittle ramp they\'d used to roll things in and Bobby\'s feet touched it\r\nbut lightly as he jumped into the ship. He found himself in some kind of\r\na storeroom. It would be a good place to hide all right. It was full of\r\naluminum barrels all the same size. He found a space between two rows\r\nand sat down and got his breath back. 

It was very quiet around him.\r\nScary quiet. But he set his lips firmly.\r\n\r\nHe was going to the moon with Dad.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJohn Kendall was a little late that night. He kissed his wife and said,\r\n"Well, did you see the big sky rocket?"\r\n\r\n"How could I miss it, darling? 

Your supper is in the oven."\r\n\r\n"I could use a Martini first."\r\n\r\n"Coming right up."\r\n\r\nWhile Myra fixed the drink John lay back in his easy chair and closed\r\nhis eyes. "We\'d hoped to stage a little ceremony at the launching but\r\nWashington said no."\r\n\r\n"The Russians?"\r\n\r\n"The Eastern Coalition. It was a race. 

That was why it had to be so\r\nsecret. Washington said, light the fuse and fire the thing."\r\n\r\n"Is it still hush-hush?"\r\n\r\n"No. Not between us at least. We fired an explosion rocket at the moon.\r\nIt will hit in about an hour and telescopes will show a big purple spot\r\nwhen our explosives go off and throw dye all over the place."\r\n\r\nMyra handed him a dry Martini. 

"I see. 

Lots of fun no doubt but what\'s\r\nthe purpose? Fourth of July on the moon?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no. If the experiment is a success the next rocket will carry men\r\ninstead of a bomb."\r\n\r\nMyra went to the kitchen to see about supper. John called, "Where\'s\r\nBobby? In bed I suppose."\r\n\r\nMyra didn\'t hear and John set his drink down and moved toward the\r\nbedroom. Maybe he was still awake.\r\n\r\nBobby rolled over. His eyes popped open. 

"Dad! I thought you went to--"\r\n\r\nJohn Kendall sat down on the edge of the bed and tousled his son\'s hair.\r\n"No, son. It\'s the old _terra firma_ for me. Did you see the rocket\r\nblast?"\r\n\r\n"Uh-huh. It was really something. It went to the moon, didn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s right." 

Kendall smiled and thought. Try to keep a secret from\r\nthe kids. It just can\'t be done. "How\'s _your_ moon rocket coming along,\r\nson?"\r\n\r\n"Pretty good. Gee, Dad! As long as you didn\'t go, I\'m glad I didn\'t go\r\neither."\r\n\r\n"You were planning to make the trip also?"\r\n\r\n"Uh-huh. I got into the rocket and was all set but I got to thinking\r\nabout Mom--how one of us should stay and take care of her in case\r\nanything happened."\r\n\r\n"Smart thinking, son. Now you get to sleep. I\'ll have a little time\r\ntomorrow. We\'ll play some ball."\r\n\r\n"That will be keen!"\r\n\r\nJohn Kendall smiled as he left the bedroom. Kids were wonderful! Give\r\nthem a few old boards and a steering wheel and they could build a ship\r\nto fly to the moon. What a wonderful dream world they lived in!\r\n\r\nToo bad they had to grow out of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Imagination_ April 1956.

The Old One watched, squinting into the morning sun. He\r\nsighed, hitched up his saffron robes and started walking down toward\r\nthe strangers.\r\n\r\nGriffin turned, not trying to conceal his excitement. "You\'re the\r\nlinguist, see what you can get out of him."\r\n\r\n"I might," Kung Su ventured sourly, "if you\'d go weed the air machine\r\nor something. This is going to be hard enough without a lot of\r\nkibitzers cramping my style and scaring Old Pruneface here half to\r\ndeath."\r\n\r\n"I see your point," Griffin answered. He turned and started back toward\r\nthe diggings. "Let me know it you make any progress with the local\r\nlanguage." He stopped whistling and strove to control the jauntiness of\r\nhis gait. _Must be the lower gravity and extra oxygen_, he thought. _I\r\nhaven\'t bounced along like this for thirty years. Nice place to settle\r\ndown if some promoter doesn\'t turn it into an old folks home._ He sighed\r\nand glanced over the diggings. The rammed earth walls were nearly\r\nobliterated by now. 

_Nothing lost_, he reflected. _It\'s all on tape\r\nand they\'re no different from a thousand others at any rate._\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nGriffin opened a door in the transparent bubble from which Alba\xc3\xb1ez was\r\noperating the diggers. "Anything?" 

he inquired.\r\n\r\n"Nothing so far," Alba\xc3\xb1ez reported. "What\'s the score on this job? I\r\nmissed the briefing."\r\n\r\n"How\'d you make out on III, by the way?"\r\n\r\n"Same old stuff, pottery shards and the usual junk. See it once and\r\nyou\'ve seen it all."\r\n\r\n"Well," Griffin began, "it looks like the same thing here again. We\'ve\r\npretty well covered this system and you know how it is. Rammed earth\r\nwalls here and there, pottery shards, flint, bronze and iron artifacts\r\nand that\'s it. They got to the iron age on every planet and then\r\nblooey."\r\n\r\n"Artifacts all made for humanoid hands I suppose. I wonder if they were\r\nclose enough to have crossbred with humans."\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t say," Griffin observed dryly. "From the looks of Old\r\nPruneface I doubt if we\'ll ever find a human female with sufficiently\r\ndetached attitude to find out."\r\n\r\n"Who\'s Pruneface?"\r\n\r\n"He came ambling down out of the hills this morning and walked into\r\ncamp."\r\n\r\n"You mean you\'ve actually found a live humanoid?"\r\n\r\n"There\'s got to be a first time for everything." Griffin opened the\r\ndoor and started climbing the hill toward Kung Su and Pruneface.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n"Well, have you gotten beyond the \'me, Charlie\' stage yet?" Griffin\r\ninquired at breakfast two days later.\r\n\r\nKung Su gave an inscrutable East Los Angeles smile. "As a matter of\r\nfact, I\'m a little farther along. 

Joe is amazingly co\xc3\xb6perative."\r\n\r\n"Joe?"\r\n\r\n"Spell it Chou if you want to be exotic. It\'s still pronounced Joe and\r\nthat\'s his name. The language is monosyllabic and tonal. 

I happen to\r\nknow a similar language."\r\n\r\n"You mean this humanoid speaks Chinese?" Griffin was never sure whether\r\nKung was ribbing him or not.\r\n\r\n"Not Chinese. The vocabulary is different but the syntax and phonemes\r\nare nearly identical. 

I\'ll speak it perfectly in a week. 

It\'s just a\r\nquestion of memorizing two or three thousand new words. Incidentally,\r\nJoe wants to know why you\'re digging up his bottom land. He was all set\r\nto flood it today."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t tell me he plants rice!" Griffin exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t imagine it\'s rice, but it needs flooding whatever it is."\r\n\r\n"Ask him how many humanoids there are on this planet."\r\n\r\n"I\'m way ahead of you, Griffin. He says there are only a few thousand\r\nleft. The rest were all destroyed in a war with the barbarians."\r\n\r\n"Barbarians?"\r\n\r\n"They\'re extinct."\r\n\r\n"How many races were there?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll get to that if you\'ll stop interrupting," Kung rejoined testily.\r\n"Joe says there are only two kinds of people, his own dark,\r\nstraight-haired kind and the barbarians. They have curly hair, white\r\nskin and round eyes. You\'d pass for a barbarian, according to Joe, only\r\nyou don\'t have a faceful of hair. He wants to know how things are going\r\non the other planets."\r\n\r\n"I suppose that\'s my cue to break into a cold sweat and feel a\r\npremonition of disaster." Griffin tried to smile and almost made it.\r\n\r\n"Not necessarily, but it seems our iron-age man is fairly well informed\r\nin extraplanetary affairs."\r\n\r\n"I guess I\'d better start learning the language."\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nThanks to the spade work Kung Su had done in preparing hypno-recordings,\r\nGriffin had a working knowledge of the Rational People\'s language\r\neleven days later when he sat down to drink herb infused hot water with\r\nJoe and other Old Ones in the low-roofed wooden building around which\r\nclustered a village of two hundred humanoids. He fidgeted through\r\ninterminable ritualistic cups of hot water. Eventually Joe hid his\r\nhands in the sleeves of his robe and turned with an air of polite\r\ninquiry. _Now we get down to business_, Griffin thought.\r\n\r\n"Joe, you know by now why we\'re digging up your bottom land. We\'ll\r\nrecompense you in one way or another. 

Meanwhile, could you give me a\r\nlittle local history?"\r\n\r\nJoe smiled like a well nourished bodhisattva. "Approximately how far\r\nback would you like me to begin?"\r\n\r\n"At the beginning."\r\n\r\n"How long is a year on your planet?" Joe inquired.\r\n\r\n"Your year is eight and a half days longer. Our day is three hundred\r\nheartbeats longer than yours."\r\n\r\nJoe nodded his thanks. 

"More water?"\r\n\r\nGriffin declined, suppressing a shudder.\r\n\r\n"Five million years ago we were limited to one planet," Joe began. "The\r\ncourt astronomer had a vision of our planet in flames. I imagine you\'d\r\nsay our sun was about to nova. The empress was disturbed and ordered a\r\nconvocation of seers. One fasted overlong and saw an answer. As the\r\ndying seer predicted the Son of Heaven came with fire-breathing\r\ndragons. The fairest of maidens and the strongest of our young men were\r\ntaken to serve his warriors. We served them honestly and faithfully. A\r\nthousand years later their empire collapsed leaving us scattered across\r\nthe universe. Three thousand years later a new race of barbarians\r\nconquered our planets. We surrendered naturally and soon were serving\r\nour new masters. Five hundred years passed and they destroyed\r\nthemselves. This has been the pattern of our existence from that day to\r\nthis."\r\n\r\n"You mean you\'ve been slaves for five million years?" Griffin was\r\nincredulous.\r\n\r\n"Servitude has ever been a refuge for the scholar and the philosopher."\r\n\r\n"But what point is there in such a life? 

Why do you continue living\r\nthis way?"\r\n\r\n"What is the point in any way of life? Continued existence. Personal\r\nimmortality is neither desirable nor possible. We settled for\r\nperpetuation of the race."\r\n\r\n"But what about self-determination? You know enough astronomy to\r\nunderstand novae. Surely you realize it could happen again. What would\r\nyou do without a technology to build spaceships?"\r\n\r\n"Many stars have gone nova during our history. Usually the barbarians\r\ncame in time. When they didn\'t--"\r\n\r\n"You mean you don\'t really care?"\r\n\r\n"All barbarians ask that sooner or later," Joe smiled. "Sometimes\r\ntoward the end they even accuse us of destroying them. We don\'t. Every\r\ntechnology bears the seeds of its own destruction. The stars are older\r\nthan the machinery that explores them."\r\n\r\n"You used technology to get from one system to another."\r\n\r\n"We used it, but we were never part of it. When machines fail, their\r\npeople die. We have no machines."\r\n\r\n"What would you do if this sun were to nova?"\r\n\r\n"We can serve you. We are not unintelligent."\r\n\r\n"Willing to work your way around the galaxy, eh? But what if we refused\r\nto take you?"\r\n\r\n"The race would go on. Kung Su tells me there is no life on planets of\r\nthis system, but there are other systems."\r\n\r\n"You\'re whistling in the dark," Griffin scoffed. "How do you know if\r\nany of the Rational People survive?"\r\n\r\n"How far back does your history go?" Joe inquired.\r\n\r\n"It\'s hard to say exactly," Griffin replied. "Our earliest written\r\nrecords date back some seven thousand years."\r\n\r\n"You are all of one race?"\r\n\r\n"No, you may have noticed Kung Su is slightly different from the rest\r\nof us."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Griffin, I have noticed. When you return ask Kung Su for the\r\nlegend of creation. More hot water?" Joe stirred and Griffin guessed\r\nthe interview was over. He drank another ritual cup, made his farewells\r\nand walked thoughtfully back to camp.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n"Kung," Griffin asked over coffee next afternoon, "how well up are you\r\non Chinese mythology?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, fair, I guess. 

It isn\'t my field but I remember some of the\r\nstories my grandfather used to tell me."\r\n\r\n"What is your legend of creation?" Griffin persisted.\r\n\r\n"It\'s pretty well garbled but I remember something about the Son of\r\nHeaven bringing the early settlers from a land of two moons on the back\r\nof his fire-breathing dragon. The dragon got sick and died so they\r\ncouldn\'t ever get back to heaven again. There\'s a lot of stuff about\r\ndevils, too."\r\n\r\n"What about devils?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t remember too well, but they were supposed to do terrible\r\nthings to you and even to your unborn children if they ever caught you.\r\nThey must have been pretty stupid though; they couldn\'t turn corners.\r\nMy grandfather\'s store had devil screens at all the doors so you had to\r\nturn a corner to get in. The first time I saw the lead baffles at the\r\npile chamber doors on this ship it reminded me of home sweet home. By\r\nthe way, some young men from the village were around today. They want\r\nto work passage to the next planet. 

What do you think?"\r\n\r\nGriffin was silent for a long time.\r\n\r\n"Well, what do you say? We can use some hand labor for the delicate\r\ndigging. Want to put them on?"\r\n\r\n"Might as well." Griffin answered. "There\'s a streetcar every\r\nmillennium anyway."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by that?

"\r\n\r\n"You wouldn\'t understand. You sold your birthright to the barbarians."\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

And at the point it is, obviously,\r\nNecessary._\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo king-sized bands blared martial music, the "_Internationale_" and\r\nthe "Star-Spangled Banner," each seemingly trying to drown the other in\r\na _G\xc3\xb6tterd\xc3\xa4mmerung_ of acoustics.\r\n\r\nTwo lines of troops, surfacely differing in uniforms and in weapons, but\r\nbasically so very the same, so evenly matched, came to attention. A\r\nthousand hands slapped a thousand submachine gun stocks.\r\n\r\nMarshal Vladimir Ignatov strode stiff-kneed down the long march, the\r\nstride of a man for years used to cavalry boots. He was flanked by\r\nfrozen visaged subordinates, but none so cold of face as he himself.\r\n\r\nAt the entrance to the conference hall he stopped, turned and waited.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the corridor of troops a car stopped and several figures\r\nemerged, most of them in civilian dress, several bearing brief cases.\r\nThey in their turn ran the gantlet.\r\n\r\nAt their fore walked James Warren Donlevy, spritely, his eyes darting\r\nhere, there, politician-like. A half smile on his face, as though afraid\r\nhe might forget to greet a voter he knew, or was supposed to know.\r\n\r\nHis hand was out before that of Vladimir Ignatov\'s.\r\n\r\n"Your Excellency," he said.\r\n\r\nIgnatov shook hands stiffly. Dropped that of the other\'s as soon as\r\nprotocol would permit.\r\n\r\nThe field marshal indicated the door of the conference hall. "There is\r\nlittle reason to waste time, Mr. President."\r\n\r\n"Exactly," Donlevy snapped.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe door closed behind them and the two men, one uniformed and\r\nbemedaled, the other nattily attired in his business suit, turned to\r\neach other.\r\n\r\n"Nice to see you again, Vovo. How\'re Olga and the baby?"\r\n\r\nThe soldier grinned back in response. "Two babies now--you don\'t keep up\r\non the _real_ news, Jim. How\'s Martha?" They shook hands.\r\n\r\n"Not so good," Jim said, scowling. "I\'m worried. It\'s that new cancer.\r\nAs soon as we conquer one type two more rear up. How are you people\r\ndoing on cancer research?"\r\n\r\nVovo was stripping off his tunic. He hung it over the back of one of the\r\nchairs, began to unbutton his high, tight military collar. "I\'m not\r\nreally up on it, Jim, but I think that\'s one field where you can trust\r\nanything we know to be in the regular scientific journals our people\r\nexchange with yours. I\'ll make some inquiries when I get back home,\r\nthough. You never know, this new strain--I guess you\'d call it--might be\r\none that we\'re up on and you aren\'t."\r\n\r\n"Yeah," Jim said. 

"Thanks a lot." He crossed to the small portable bar.\r\n"How about a drink? Whisky, vodka, rum--there\'s ice."\r\n\r\nVovo slumped into one of the heavy chairs that were arranged around the\r\ntable. He grimaced, "No vodka, I don\'t feel patriotic today. How about\r\none of those long cold drinks, with the cola stuff?"\r\n\r\n"Cuba libra," Jim said. "Coming up. 

Look, would you rather speak\r\nRussian?"\r\n\r\n"No," Vovo said, "my English is getting rusty. I need the practice."\r\n\r\nJim brought the glasses over and put them on the table. He began\r\nstripping off his own coat, loosening his tie. "God, I\'m tired," he\r\nsaid. "This sort of thing wears me down."\r\n\r\nVovo sipped his drink. "Now there\'s as good a thing to discuss as any,\r\nin the way of killing time. The truth now, Jim, do you really believe in\r\na God? After all that\'s happened to this human race of ours, do you\r\nreally believe in divine guidance?" He twisted his mouth sarcastically.\r\n\r\nThe other relaxed. 

"I don\'t know," he said. 

"I suppose so. I was raised\r\nin a family that believed in God. Just as, I suppose, you were raised in\r\none that didn\'t." He lifted his shoulders slightly in a shrug. "Neither\r\nof us seems to be particularly brilliant in establishing a position of\r\nour own."\r\n\r\nVovo snorted. "Never thought of it that way," he admitted. "We\'re\r\nusually contemptuous of anyone still holding to the old beliefs. There\r\naren\'t many left."\r\n\r\n"More than you people admit, I understand."\r\n\r\nVovo shook his heavy head. "No, not really. Mostly crackpots. Have you\r\never noticed how it is that the nonconformists in any society are\r\nusually crackpots? The people on your side that admit belonging to our\r\norganizations, are usually on the wild eyed and uncombed hair side--I\r\nadmit it. On the other hand, the people in our citizenry who subscribe\r\nto your system, your religion, that sort of thing, are crackpots, too.\r\nApplies to religion as well as politics. An atheist in your country is a\r\nnonconformist--in mine, a Christian is. Both crackpots."\r\n\r\nJim laughed and took a sip of his drink.\r\n\r\nVovo yawned and said, "How long are we going to be in here?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. Up to us, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Yes. How about another drink? I\'ll make it. How much of that cola stuff\r\ndo you put in?"\r\n\r\nJim told him, and while the other was on his feet mixing the drinks,\r\nsaid, "You figure on sticking to the same line this year?"\r\n\r\n"Have to," Vovo said over his shoulder. "What\'s the alternative?

"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. We\'re building up to a whale of a depression as it is,\r\neven with half the economy running full blast producing defense\r\nmaterials."\r\n\r\nVovo chuckled, "Defense materials. I wonder if ever in the history of\r\nthe human race anyone ever admitted to producing _offense_ materials."\r\n\r\n"Well, you call it the same thing. All your military equipment is for\r\ndefense. And, of course, according to your press, all ours is for\r\noffense."\r\n\r\n"Of course," Vovo said.\r\n\r\nHe brought the glasses back and handed one to the other. He slumped back\r\ninto his chair again, loosened two buttons of his trousers.\r\n\r\n"Jim," Vovo said, "why don\'t you divert more of your economy to public\r\nworks, better roads, reforestation, dams--that sort of thing."\r\n\r\nJim said wearily, "You\'re a better economist than that. Didn\'t your boy\r\nMarx, or was it Engels, write a small book on the subject? We\'re already\r\noverproducing--turning out more products than we can sell."\r\n\r\n"I wasn\'t talking about your government building new steel mills. But\r\ndams, roads, that sort of thing. You could plow billions into such items\r\nand get some real use out of them. We both know that our weapons will\r\nnever be used--they can\'t be."\r\n\r\nJim ticked them off on his fingers. "We already are producing more farm\r\nproducts than we know what to do with; if we build more dams it\'ll open\r\nup new farm lands and increase the glut. If we build more and better\r\nroads, it will improve transportation, which will mean fewer men will be\r\nable to move greater tonnage--and throw transportation employees into\r\nthe unemployed. If we go all out for reforestation, it will eventually\r\nbring down the price of lumber and the lumber people are howling\r\nalready. No," he shook his head, "there\'s just one really foolproof way\r\nof disposing of surpluses and using up labor power and that\'s war--hot\r\nor cold."\r\n\r\nVovo shrugged, "I suppose so."\r\n\r\n"It amounts to building pyramids, of course." Jim twisted his mouth\r\nsourly. "And since we\'re asking questions about each other\'s way of\r\nlife, when is your State going to begin to _wither away_?

"\r\n\r\n"How was that?" Vovo asked.\r\n\r\n"According to your sainted founder, once you people came to power the\r\nState was going to wither away, class rule would be over, and Utopia be\r\non hand. That was a long time ago, and your State is stronger than\r\nours.

"\r\n\r\nVovo snorted. "How can we wither away the State as long as we are\r\nthreatened by capitalist aggression?"\r\n\r\nJim said, "Ha!

"\r\n\r\nVovo went on. "You know better than that, Jim. The only way my\r\norganization can keep in power is by continually beating the drums,\r\nkeeping our people stirred up to greater and greater sacrifices by using\r\nyou as a threat. Didn\'t the old Romans have some sort of maxim to the\r\neffect that when you\'re threatened with unease at home stir up trouble\r\nabroad?"\r\n\r\n"You\'re being even more frank than usual," Jim said. "But that\'s one of\r\nthe pleasures of these get-togethers, neither of us resorts to\r\nhypocrisy. But you can\'t keep up these tensions forever."\r\n\r\n"You mean _we_ can\'t keep up these tensions forever, Jim. And when they\r\nend? Well, personally I can\'t see my organization going out without a\r\nblood bath." He grimaced sourly, "And since I\'d probably be one of the\r\nfirst to be bathed, I\'d like to postpone the time. It\'s like having a\r\ntiger by the tail, Jim. 

We can\'t let go."\r\n\r\n"Happily, I don\'t feel in the same spot," Jim said. He got up and went\r\nto the picture window that took up one entire wall. It faced out over a\r\nmountain vista. He looked soberly into the sky.\r\n\r\nVovo joined him, glass in hand.\r\n\r\n"Possibly your position isn\'t exactly the same as ours but there\'ll be\r\nsome awfully great changes if that military based economy of yours\r\nsuddenly had peace thrust upon it. You\'d have a depression such as\r\nyou\'ve never dreamed of. Let\'s face reality, Jim, neither of us can\r\nafford peace."\r\n\r\n"Well, we\'ve both known that for a long time."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey both considered somberly, the planet Earth blazing away, a small\r\nsun there in the sky.\r\n\r\nJim said, "I sometimes think that the race would have been better off,\r\nwhen man was colonizing Venus and Mars, if it had been a joint\r\nenterprise rather than you people doing one, and we the other. If it had\r\nall been in the hands of that organization ..."\r\n\r\n"The United Nations?" Vovo supplied.\r\n\r\n"... Then when Bomb Day hit, perhaps these new worlds could have gone on\r\nto, well, better things."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps," Vovo shrugged. "I\'ve often wondered how Bomb Day started. Who\r\nstruck the spark."\r\n\r\n"Happily there were enough colonists on both planets to start the race\r\nall over again," Jim said. "What difference does it make, who struck the\r\nspark?

"\r\n\r\n"None, I suppose." Vovo began to button his collar, readjust his\r\nclothes. "Well, shall we emerge and let the quaking multitudes know that\r\nonce again we have made a shaky agreement? 

One that will last until the\r\nnext summit meeting."\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note\r\n\r\nIn two places in the text the word "reforestration" was corrected to\r\n"reforestation."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n


So I certainly could not be subtle, which requires\r\nboth cleverness and an ability to tell the truth and a lie in the same\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\nLet us turn back the clock a few ages. I was lying in the sun thinking\r\nof love. I understand that you human beings have an aversion to\r\nbiological discussion, so I will not go into detail. But I must remind\r\nyou that my love life is quite different from yours, for I am from\r\nanother planet. At the time under discussion, I was most deeply in love.\r\n\r\nMy heart\'s desire had no shape, the lovely creature. She had no\r\nintelligence, the divine soul. But she was the greatest bit of\r\nprotoplasm in any galaxy you could name. By our standards, I probably\r\nmight be called handsome. I was young and healthy. I had all of my genes\r\nand chromosomes. My color was the dirty green that is associated with\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nThe sun warmed my body and the tidal undulation of my planet\'s surface\r\nrocked me gently. And then she came into my life. She floated gently in\r\nthe breeze, her dainty figure held aloft by a mere hint of levitation.\r\nSparks of static electricity shot from her tender cilia so brightly that\r\nI was forced to exude a layer of protective fibre to protect my visual\r\nbuds. She sucked a deep breath of cyanic gas into her pulmonary pouch\r\nand spoke to me sweetly with a voice like distant thunder.\r\n\r\n"My dear Yljm, the world is coming to an end."\r\n\r\nI could not believe her, for she had no intelligence. 

She only loved to\r\ntalk. "Perhaps," I said, "but not today."\r\n\r\n"Very soon, then," said she. Her name was Mjly.\r\n\r\nI watched her with patronizing amusement. The static electricity showed\r\nthat she was nervous and upset, but people often get nervous and upset\r\nover trivial matters. "Now, how," I reasoned, "could our world come to\r\nan end? 

The other planet has gone on for thousands of years without\r\ncolliding with us. We circle it, in fact."\r\n\r\n"No," Mjly said, "that is not our doom. Actually our world will not\r\ncease to exist. Life will end here, that is all."\r\n\r\n"Ah," I said. "Our atmosphere is escaping into space." I sucked air,\r\nviciously. True, the air was thin. True, the atmosphere was escaping.\r\nBut there would be breathable amounts for many thousands of centuries\r\nyet to come.\r\n\r\n"Not the air. The food is all gone. Things we eat have ceased to exist."\r\n\r\nI levitated myself and looked out over the throbbing land. A few years\r\nago, this land had been covered with vegetation. I had come to take\r\nvegetation so much for granted that I\'d ceased to notice it. Now it was\r\ngone. There were no round fruits growing from tender grasses, no tubers\r\ndangling from the fungus trees, no legume vines sprawling over the\r\nrocks. Everywhere lay desert, barren dunes shaking their crests with\r\ntidal motion.\r\n\r\nI lowered myself to the ground and dug my big fibrosities into the sod.\r\nNo green leaves grew there beneath the surface. The soil was dead. "This\r\nwill seriously interfere with our future, Mjly," I said.\r\n\r\n"We might eat each other," she replied, "but then there would be no one\r\nleft."\r\n\r\n"No one? 

There are many others here."\r\n\r\n"The others are dying," said Mjly, blinking her otic nerves eerily. "We\r\nsoon will be the only ones left."\r\n\r\nIt was indeed a senseless thing to do, to die just because there was no\r\nmeans of going on living. But I must admit that I was tempted for a\r\nmoment. But I hung onto myself, for there was Mjly, and as long as she\r\nlived, there was a reason for me to live too.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not a cheerful prospect," I said, "but I suppose death by\r\nstarvation is the best way out. We will face death as we have lived,\r\ncheerfully and fortuitously."\r\n\r\n"And why should we die, when there is another world so close?" she\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n"Are you suggesting interplanetary flight, my dear?" I was amused again,\r\neven though there was little enough left to be amused at.\r\n\r\nShe crinkled her sense of smell in reply, and I realized I was not being\r\namused at the right time. Anchoring herself by magnetic processes, she\r\nbegan to weave the atmosphere delicately with her taste-bud tendrils.\r\nQuickly she hollowed the air molecules into a reflective mirror, and\r\nbrought it to focus on our neighboring world. I levitated myself into a\r\nposition so that I could look into the mirror.\r\n\r\nThe near planet was quite satisfactory. It was the one you know as the\r\nearth. 

It was young. It was green. Huge fern-like plants grew abundantly\r\non its surface. 

It was full of food. And near.\r\n\r\n"The trip could be made by levitation," Mjly said.\r\n\r\nI hung back. "Animals might live there. We\'d be devoured."\r\n\r\n"I am not afraid," she said.\r\n\r\n"We might not get hungry for a time. Let us linger here awhile. Later\r\nwhen we get desperate, there will be time enough for interplanetary\r\nflight." I hated the thought of stuffing myself full of air enough to\r\nlast for the long trip.\r\n\r\nMjly lowered her visual buds. "I am going to become a mother," she said.\r\n\r\n"Go then, and become a mother. I\'ll stay here till I get hungry and then\r\njoin you.

"\r\n\r\nMjly unflexed her sense of touch and I felt sorry for her. "If I could\r\nbe sure," I said, "that no wild animals live on the earth, I\'d go\r\nsooner."\r\n\r\nShe snapped her sense of balance in happiness. "I will go first," said\r\nshe. "If everything is pleasant and safe, I will return and let you\r\nknow."\r\n\r\nI nodded my otic nerves and off she went.\r\n\r\nAs you human beings are doubtless aware, space levitation is quite\r\ncomplicated, but not beyond accomplishment. Once you are able to reach\r\nthe speed of escape the rest is easy. But Mjly was young and strong and\r\nsoon she had disappeared from sight traveling at a tremendous velocity.\r\nI followed her as long as I could with the telescope and then I lowered\r\nmyself to the tidal crest of a nearby sand dune and lost myself in\r\nmetaphysical thoughts.\r\n\r\nAlmost half a year later I realized that Mjly had been gone longer than\r\nI expected. Either she had been eaten by wild animals on the earth, or\r\nshe had forgotten me.\r\n\r\nI was beginning to get lonesome and in a few more months I would get\r\nhungry. At the thought of enduring two such excruciating pains at a\r\nsingle time, I decided to risk my life. I would travel through space to\r\nthe earth and try to find my beloved.\r\n\r\nAs you may have guessed, the planet on which we had been living is the\r\none you now know as the Moon, and the distance to the earth is\r\ncomparatively small. The sand dunes now have hardened and the tidal sway\r\nof its surface can be felt only slightly. The moon no longer turns on\r\nits axis and it has no sweetly scented cyanide in its atmosphere. It has\r\nno atmosphere of any sort. But it stands now as it did when I left it,\r\nglorious in death. Since I departed, no living thing has trod its soil.\r\n\r\nMy scientific sense instinctively came to the rescue as I approached the\r\nearth. I felt a strong gravity wrenching at my vitals and so instead of\r\ntrying reverse levitation, I spread my processes so that the atmosphere\r\ncaught in the folds of my skin and I came floating gently down to the\r\nground without harm.\r\n\r\nThe earth was much as it had appeared through the molecule telescope. It\r\nwas covered with green vegetation, good, rich, nourishing stuff. And\r\nthere was enough to feed Mjly and me for a million years.\r\n\r\nThere were no animals of any sort. Again I went to my scientific sense\r\nfor the answer. I realized that while vegetable life was far advanced,\r\nanimal life had yet to appear. Mjly was the first of this type of life\r\never to set foot on terrestrial soil.\r\n\r\nBut where was she? On the moon, I could often locate her a thousand\r\nmiles away by a simple radio call. Although the earth was much larger\r\nthan the moon, I did not doubt that she was within a thousand miles. So\r\nI generated power and issued a call.\r\n\r\nI waited for the response. It came feebly to my antenna.\r\n\r\nUsing my sense of direction, I pushed through the vegetation in search\r\nof her. I did not levitate, because the feebleness of her call indicated\r\nshe might be hurt and on the ground. Besides, levitation is much more\r\ndifficult on the earth than on the moon.\r\n\r\nThe reply came stronger to my next call and I sensed through seven of my\r\nsenses that she was near. She was on the ground, probably injured, which\r\nexplained why she had not returned as she had promised.\r\n\r\nI came to a patch of wilderness, a great marshy plain. In the middle of\r\nthis swamp was a crater, like those caused by meteors, a deep, ugly scar\r\nin the mud. I shuddered at the thought that my darling Mjly might have\r\nlanded there. Her weaker scientific sense might not have given her the\r\ncue to use her skin as a parachute and she might have made the fatal\r\nmistake of trying to reverse-levitate.\r\n\r\n"Mjly!" I called, speaking aloud now. 

"Mjly! Where are you?"\r\n\r\n"Yljm! I am here!"\r\n\r\nYes, the voice came from the crater. Gliding to its rim, I looked down.\r\nA pool of water lay on the bottom. A greenish scum covered the surface.\r\nThe scum moved with a million tiny wriggles.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Yljm," came Mjly\'s voice. "It is I. But I am no longer one being."\r\nAnd her voice sounded like a million tiny chirps joined together. "I\r\nlanded with such force that I came apart. Now each of my body cells\r\nlives a life of its own. And now and then each cell grows fat and\r\nbecomes two. I am my sisters, I ..."\r\n\r\nLet\'s not be subtle about it. Mjly was a microbe, the beginning of\r\nanimal life on the earth. She lives today, she is and always will be her\r\nsisters, her mothers, herselves and her ancestors. But there are few\r\nancestors, for microbes do not die--just part of themselves die.\r\n\r\nAnd I do not die. For I crept away into a hole in the ground, where I\r\nwill live forever. 

I do not starve, for roots reach me here. But I miss\r\nmy love life with Mjly. I can never be a mother or a sister. I will\r\nalways be me, a lonesome old bem.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           \xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7 THE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _If Worlds of Science Fiction_ July\r\n    1954.

She was not disappointed. "Is Terry really way up there all\r\nalone, Martha?" "Aren\'t you _scared_, Martha?" 

"I do hope they can get\r\nhim back down all right, Martha." She supposed it must have given them\r\nquite a turn to have their egg woman change into a star mother\r\novernight.\r\n\r\nShe hadn\'t expected the TV interview, though, and she would have avoided\r\nit if it had been politely possible. But what could she do when the line\r\nof cars and trucks pulled into the drive and the technicians got out and\r\nstarted setting up their equipment in the backyard? What could she say\r\nwhen the suave young man came up to her and said, "We want you to know\r\nthat we\'re all very proud of your boy up there, ma\'am, and we hope\r\nyou\'ll do us the honor of answering a few questions."\r\n\r\nMost of the questions concerned Terry, as was fitting. From the way the\r\nsuave young man asked them, though, she got the impression that he was\r\ntrying to prove that her son was just like any other average American\r\nboy, and such just didn\'t happen to be the case. But whenever she opened\r\nher mouth to mention, say, how he used to study till all hours of the\r\nnight, or how difficult it had been for him to make friends because of\r\nhis shyness, or the fact that he had never gone out for\r\nfootball--whenever she started to mention any of these things, the suave\r\nyoung man was in great haste to interrupt her and to twist her words, by\r\nrequestioning, into a different meaning altogether, till Terry\'s\r\nbehavior pattern seemed to coincide with the behavior pattern which the\r\nsuave young man apparently considered the norm, but which, if followed,\r\nMartha was sure, would produce not young men bent on exploring space but\r\nyoung men bent on exploring trivia.\r\n\r\nA few of the questions concerned herself: Was Terry her only child?\r\n("Yes.") What had happened to her husband? 

("He was killed in the Korean\r\nWar.") What did she think of the new law granting star mothers top\r\npriority on any and all information relating to their sons? ("I think\r\nit\'s a fine law ... It\'s too bad they couldn\'t have shown similar\r\nhumanity toward the war mothers of World War II.")\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was late in the afternoon by the time the TV crew got everything\r\nrepacked into their cars and trucks and made their departure. Martha\r\nfixed herself a light supper, then donned an old suede jacket of Terry\'s\r\nand went out into the garden to wait for the sun to go down. According\r\nto the time table the general had outlined in his first telegram,\r\nTerry\'s first Tuesday night passage wasn\'t due to occur till 9:05. But\r\nit seemed only right that she should be outside when the stars started\r\nto come out. Presently they did, and she watched them wink on, one by\r\none, in the deepening darkness of the sky. She\'d never been much of a\r\none for the stars; most of her life she\'d been much too busy on Earth to\r\nbother with things celestial. She could remember, when she was much\r\nyounger and Bill was courting her, looking up at the moon sometimes; and\r\nonce in a while, when a star fell, making a wish. But this was\r\ndifferent. It was different because now she had a personal interest in\r\nthe sky, a new affinity with its myriad inhabitants.\r\n\r\nAnd how bright they became when you kept looking at them! They seemed to\r\ncome alive, almost, pulsing brilliantly down out of the blackness of the\r\nnight ... And they were different colors, too, she noticed with a start.\r\nSome of them were blue and some were red, others were yellow ... green\r\n... orange ...\r\n\r\nIt grew cold in the April garden and she could see her breath. There was\r\na strange crispness, a strange clarity about the night, that she had\r\nnever known before ... She glanced at her watch, was astonished to see\r\nthat the hands indicated two minutes after nine. Where had the time\r\ngone? Tremulously she faced the southern horizon ... and saw her Terry\r\nappear in his shining chariot, riding up the star-pebbled path of his\r\norbit, a star in his own right, dropping swiftly now, down, down, and\r\nout of sight beyond the dark wheeling mass of the Earth ... She took a\r\ndeep, proud breath, realized that she was wildly waving her hand and let\r\nit fall slowly to her side. Make a wish! she thought, like a little\r\ngirl, and she wished him pleasant dreams and a safe return and wrapped\r\nthe wish in all her love and cast it starward.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSometime tomorrow, the general\'s telegram had said--\r\n\r\nThat meant sometime today!\r\n\r\nShe rose with the sun and fed the chickens, fixed and ate her breakfast,\r\ncollected the eggs and put them in their cardboard boxes, then started\r\nout on her Wednesday morning run. "My land, Martha, I don\'t see how you\r\nstand it with him way up there! 

Doesn\'t it get on your _nerves_?" ("Yes\r\n... Yes, it does.") "Martha, when are they bringing him back down?"\r\n("Today ... 

_Today_!") "It must be wonderful being a star mother,\r\nMartha." ("Yes, it is--in a way.

")\r\n\r\nWonderful ... and terrible.\r\n\r\nIf only he can last it out for a few more hours, she thought. 

If only\r\nthey can bring him down safe and sound. Then the vigil will be over, and\r\nsome other mother can take over the awesome responsibility of having a\r\nson become a star--\r\n\r\nIf only ...\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe general\'s third telegram arrived that afternoon: _Regret to inform\r\nyou that meteorite impact on satellite hull severely damaged\r\ncapsule-detachment mechanism, making ejection impossible. Will make\r\nevery effort to find another means of accomplishing your son\'s return._\r\n\r\nTerry!--\r\n\r\nSee the little boy playing beneath the maple tree, moving his tiny cars\r\nup and down the tiny streets of his make-believe village; the little\r\nboy, his fuzz of hair gold in the sunlight, his cherub-cheeks pink in\r\nthe summer wind--\r\n\r\n_Terry!--_\r\n\r\nUp the lane the blue-denimed young man walks, swinging his thin tanned\r\narms, his long legs making near-grownup strides over the sun-seared\r\ngrass; the sky blue and bright behind him, the song of cicada rising and\r\nfalling in the hazy September air--\r\n\r\n_Terry ..._\r\n\r\n_--probably won\'t get a chance to write you again before take-off, but\r\ndon\'t worry, Ma. The _Explorer XII_ is the greatest bird they ever\r\nbuilt. Nothing short of a direct meteorite hit can hurt it, and the odds\r\nare a million to one ..._\r\n\r\n_Why don\'t they leave the stars alone? Why don\'t they leave the stars to\r\nGod?_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe afternoon shadows lengthened on the lawn and the sun grew red and\r\nswollen over the western hills. Martha fixed supper, tried to eat, and\r\ncouldn\'t. After a while, when the light began to fade, she slipped into\r\nTerry\'s jacket and went outside.\r\n\r\nSlowly the sky darkened and the stars began to appear. At length _her_\r\nstar appeared, but its swift passage blurred before her eyes. Tires\r\ncrunched on the gravel then, and headlights washed the darkness from the\r\ndrive. A car door slammed.\r\n\r\nMartha did not move. _Please God_, she thought, _let it be Terry_, even\r\nthough she knew that it couldn\'t possibly be Terry. Footsteps sounded\r\nbehind her, paused. Someone coughed softly. She turned then--\r\n\r\n"Good evening, ma\'am."\r\n\r\nShe saw the circlet of stars on the gray epaulet; she saw the stern\r\nhandsome face; she saw the dark tired eyes. 

And she knew. Even before he\r\nspoke again, she knew--\r\n\r\n"The same meteorite that damaged the ejection mechanism, ma\'am. It\r\npenetrated the capsule, too. We didn\'t find out till just a while\r\nago--but there was nothing we could have done anyway ... Are you all\r\nright, ma\'am?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. I\'m all right."\r\n\r\n"I wanted to express my regrets personally. I know how you must feel.

"\r\n\r\n"It\'s all right."\r\n\r\n"We will, of course, make every effort to bring back his ... remains ...\r\nso that he can have a fitting burial on Earth."\r\n\r\n"No," she said.\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon, ma\'am?"\r\n\r\nShe raised her eyes to the patch of sky where her son had passed in his\r\nshining metal sarcophagus. Sirius blossomed there, blue-white and\r\nbeautiful. She raised her eyes still higher--and beheld the vast\r\nparterre of Orion with its central motif of vivid forget-me-nots, its\r\nfar-flung blooms of Betelguese and Rigel, of Bellatrix and Saiph ... And\r\nhigher yet--and there flamed the exquisite flower beds of Taurus and\r\nGemini, there burgeoned the riotous wreath of the Crab; there lay the\r\npulsing petals of the Pleiades ... And down the ecliptic garden path,\r\nwafted by a stellar breeze, drifted the ocher rose of Mars ...\r\n\r\n"No," she said again.\r\n\r\nThe general had raised his eyes, too; now, slowly, he lowered them. "I\r\nthink I understand, ma\'am. And I\'m glad that\'s the way you want it ...\r\nThe stars _are_ beautiful tonight, aren\'t they."\r\n\r\n"More beautiful than they\'ve ever been," she said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter the general had gone, she looked up once more at the vast and\r\nvariegated garden of the sky where her son lay buried, then she turned\r\nand walked slowly back to the memoried house.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ January 1959.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

]\r\n\r\n\r\nDonnie clenched his small fists and tried not to cry, but two\r\nelliptical tears ran slowly down his cheeks. The sight of them made Mr.\r\nAmes even madder.\r\n\r\n"Look at him," he stormed, turning to Martha. "Just look at him. Every\r\ndamn time I try to reason with him, he starts to snivel like an animal,\r\ninstead of acting like a normal human being." Mr. Ames flicked his\r\ncigar ashes toward a vacuum cup on the wall and looked down at the boy.\r\n"Now stop that stupid crying and tell me what this is all about."\r\n\r\nDonnie sniffled a couple of times and wiped his nose on the back of one\r\nof his blue uniform sleeves.\r\n\r\n"Well," Mr. Ames said, coldly.\r\n\r\nThe boy took a deep breath and raised his head. "I want you to spend\r\nsome time with me," he said. "I want you to--" he searched the elusive\r\nshadows of memory until he found the word he wanted--"I want you to\r\n_play_ with me. That\'s it. I want you to play with me once in a while."\r\n\r\nMr. Ames blinked his eyes and stepped back. "Play," he repeated. "What\r\ndo you mean _play_?"\r\n\r\nDonnie hesitated. "You know," he said, finally, "take me on long walks\r\nand sit down and play games and tell me stories once in a while."\r\n\r\n"But you\'ve got all the stories you need," Mr. Ames said, waving his\r\nhand at the banks of audiotapes stacked neatly on the wall shelves.\r\n"And your audio-prompter can tell them better than I can."\r\n\r\n"Yes," Donnie said, "but that\'s a machine and I want--"\r\n\r\n"What\'s wrong with a machine," Mr. Ames said, his face getting red.\r\n"Some of our best things come from machines. Didn\'t they teach you that\r\nat the Incubator?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," the boy said, "but isn\'t there anything besides machines? I\r\ncan\'t play with machines, I want to play with you!" He began to sob\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nMr. Ames dashed his cigar to the floor. "I give up," he said. "By the\r\nRed Balls of Jupiter, I give up!"\r\n\r\n"Now, Henry," his wife said. "Remember, the boy\'s only seven."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t \'Henry\' me," Mr. Ames said, "And besides, what does being seven\r\nhave to do with it. When I was his age, I was an honor student in\r\nphysics. _He_ can\'t even pass algebra."\r\n\r\nDonnie stared at the toes of his boots.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve given this kid everything," Mr. Ames went on. "He\'s going to\r\nthe best pre-nuclear school in the whole hemisphere. He\'s got his own\r\nrocket kit. Why, he\'s even been on a study cruise to the moon! How\r\nmany kids his age have been to the moon already? I bet no other kid in\r\nour project has been there. And what do I get as a reward." 

Mr. Ames\r\ndidn\'t wait for an answer. "Trouble. 

That\'s what I get, trouble. Why in\r\nGalaxy he can\'t leave me alone like a normal child is more than I can\r\nunderstand." He stopped for breath and lit a fresh cigar.\r\n\r\n"Maybe the boy\'s sick," Martha said timidly.\r\n\r\nMr. Ames ignored her. "I\'ve tried to be a good father to him," he said,\r\nhis voice self-righteous. "I\'m giving him a chance to make something\r\nout of himself. All I ask is that he be of service to the world, and\r\nmake me proud of him some day. But what does he do? Does he concentrate\r\non his career, like the rest of the kids? Hell, no, he wants to hang\r\naround me, always underfoot, always asking stupid questions. Play!" Mr.\r\nAmes snorted.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not just play."\r\n\r\n"Heh, what\'s that?" Mr. Ames jumped.\r\n\r\n"I said it\'s not just play," Donnie repeated, bravely brushing away\r\nhis tears. "You don\'t give me any--" he searched again for the right\r\nword--"any _companionship_. A boy needs companionship. Don\'t you\r\nunderstand?"\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t," Mr. Ames said. "And I\'m sure they didn\'t teach you\r\nthat in the Incubator either. Don\'t you realize you should be fully\r\ncoordinated by now. Instead, you want me to take time from my work--Why\r\nit\'s preposterous. It\'s, it\'s--unscientific!"\r\n\r\n"But, all I want--"\r\n\r\nMr. Ames held up his hand. "Enough of this," he said. "I refuse to\r\ndiscuss it anymore. Now go to your room and get ready for your study\r\nperiod."\r\n\r\nThe boy burst out crying again and ran out of the room.\r\n\r\nMr. Ames shook his head. "Definite neurotic tendencies," he muttered to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n"What dear?" his wife said.\r\n\r\n"Nothing, Martha," he answered. "Just talking to myself." He sat down\r\nheavily on the couch and sighed. What was wrong with Donnie, anyway?\r\nWhere did he get those archaic ideas from? Surely he had been taught\r\nthat the whole purpose of the incubator system was to speed up learning\r\nand growth processes so children wouldn\'t have to waste precious years\r\ngrowing up, like they did in the old days. Why their new technological\r\nage simply had no time to fool around with infantile desires. There\r\nwere too many things to do, too many knotty scientific problems to\r\nsolve. 

Emotions, Mr. Ames mumbled to himself, you never could trust\r\nyour damn emotions.\r\n\r\nThat night, after Donnie was in bed, Mr. Ames went to his study and\r\npulled out the boy\'s file. It explained what he was fitted for, what\r\nabilities he had inherited, and what his primary training included.\r\nMr. Ames noted sadly that the boy\'s Scientific Quotient was 142, well\r\nabove normal, and that he would stand six feet tall and weigh close to\r\n195 pounds when fully developed.\r\n\r\nMr. Ames, who was incubator-born himself, was completely sold on\r\nthe ingenious system the Federation of World Councils had devised.\r\nNo more hit-and-miss mass reproduction, where morons were gradually\r\nout-breeding intelligent beings, but instead, selective artificial\r\ninsemination through which only the best strains were permitted to\r\nreproduce. Each generation, the human race got healthier and smarter.\r\nInsanity and inherited diseases were a thing of the past and nature\'s\r\nprimitive law--only the fittest shall survive--was now a glittering\r\nreality. Why the Federated Incubators even took over the burden of\r\neducating the children for the first five years. Parents no longer\r\nhad to be bothered caring for helpless, bawling brats. By the time\r\nIncubates were placed on the available list, they were completely\r\nself-sufficient and emotionally conditioned to fit into any family\r\ngroup. Parents simply picked what they wanted. 

Mr. Ames, of course, had\r\nselected a future nuclear-chemist.\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful system, Mr. Ames told himself, and even more\r\nimportant, it worked. But somehow, some way, there was something\r\nradically wrong with their child.\r\n\r\n"Definite neurotic symptoms," Mr. Ames murmured, half aloud. 

By\r\nJupiter, there was only one thing to do. He shut the folder firmly and\r\nspun around to the trans-audio. A green light appeared on the panel\r\nalmost immediately.\r\n\r\n"Your connection, please?" the automon said.\r\n\r\n"Give me the local Incubator."\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, then a click. "Federated Health and Service,\r\ncoordinator speaking. May I help you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. 

This is Mr. Henry Ames, over at the Amarillo Group Project. I\r\nhave a complaint to make."\r\n\r\n"Yes?" The coordinator, a woman, was carefully polite.\r\n\r\n"It\'s about the child you sent us."\r\n\r\n"Specimen please?"\r\n\r\n"What? Oh, it\'s a boy, Class Triple A, breed, nuclear chemistry. We got\r\nhim about 18 months ago and--"\r\n\r\n"What is your number please?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s ... just a minute." 

Mr. Ames consulted the folder. "My number is\r\n34-72-oh-41. And we\'ve got a three-year guarantee," he added pointedly.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir. Just a minute sir." There was a whirring sound at the other\r\nend of the circuit. After a short wait, the coordinator\'s voice came\r\nthrough again.\r\n\r\n"Well, sir," she said. "You have the select model in our scientific\r\nline of seven-year-olds. According to our records, he checked out\r\nperfectly on all phases of learning and aptitude. Have you tried memory\r\nteaching?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'ve tried memory teaching. He learns fine." 

Mr. Ames stopped.\r\n"Look, you don\'t seem to understand. He\'s okay as far as performance\r\ngoes. He does everything we tell him and all that, but he\'s\r\nstill a real pain in the--I mean, he\'s developing very annoying\r\ncharacteristics."\r\n\r\n"Please go on, Mr. 

Ames." The coordinator\'s voice was warm and\r\nsympathetic. "How does he annoy you?"\r\n\r\n"Well, for one thing, he\'s getting pronounced possessive tendencies. He\r\nalmost seems to resent being left alone. Why, just this evening he told\r\nme he wants us to _play_ with him!"\r\n\r\n"Did you say _play_ with him?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s right," Mr. Ames said, triumphantly. "And he says he needs\r\ncompanionship, or something like that."\r\n\r\n"Companionship," the coordinator repeated. "Oh, dear. 

This is more\r\nserious than I thought. I\'m afraid you definitely have a reject,\r\nMr. Ames. If he shows these tendencies at this early age, then the\r\nsituation will be intolerable later on."\r\n\r\n"It\'s intolerable right now," Henry insisted. "Anyway, I thought you\r\npeople were supposed to clear up all this emotional unbalance in the\r\nprimary psych indoctrination."\r\n\r\n"We usually do," the coordinator agreed, "but every once in a while,\r\none slips through inspection with faulty communal-perception. The\r\none you\'ve got is obviously a throw-back." The coordinator coughed\r\napologetically. "It\'s really not the boy\'s fault, of course, but I\'m\r\nafraid we\'ll have to reclaim him."\r\n\r\n"The sooner the better," Mr. Ames said. "This mess is upsetting my work\r\nat the lab. When can I get a replacement?"\r\n\r\n"We\'ll send a new model over when we pick up the reject. Will tomorrow\r\nmorning be convenient?"\r\n\r\n"Sure. Fine. 

Just make sure this one is normal. You better check our\r\nphysio records too. I hear the people down the circle got one that\r\ndidn\'t look like them at all."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t worry," the coordinator assured him. "You\'ll get a boy you can\r\nbe proud of this time. Will there be anything more now?"\r\n\r\n"No, no, I guess not." An uneasy feeling slipped into Mr. Ames\'s\r\nconsciousness. "I just wondered," he said, suddenly. "What will happen\r\nto Don--I mean, the reject you sent us. Will he be--uh--destroyed?"\r\n\r\nThe coordinator laughed. 

"Heavens, no, Mr. Ames," she said, lightly.\r\n"He\'ll be sent to the Biological Reservation and allowed to live out\r\nhis life span with other rejects. He\'ll be much happier there. We\'re\r\nnot savages, you know."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right," Mr. Ames said, his tone matching her brightness. "We\'re\r\nnot savages. Well, we\'ll be expecting the new one tomorrow, and thanks\r\nfor all your trouble."\r\n\r\n"No trouble at all," the coordinator said, smoothly. 

"Feel free to call\r\non us any time."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


Well, not exactly, but that\'s\r\nwhat I call it. 

No, I don\'t know how it works. Too complicated for me.\r\nCarter could make it go, but after he made it he never used it. Too bad;\r\nhe thought he\'d make a lot of money with it there for awhile, while he\r\nwas working it out. Almost had me convinced, but I told him, "Get it to\r\nworking first, Carter, and then show me what you can do with it better\r\nthan I can do without it. I\'m doing pretty well as is ... pictures\r\nselling good, even if I do make \'em all by guesswork, as you call it."\r\nThat\'s what I told him.\r\n\r\nY\'see, Carter was one a them artists that think they can work everything\r\nout by formulas and stuff. Me, I just paint things as I see \'em. Never\r\nworry about perspective and all that kinda mechanical aids. Never even\r\nwent to Art School. 

But I do all right. Carter, now, was a different\r\nsorta artist. Well, he wasn\'t really an artist--more of a draftsman.\r\n\r\nI first got him in to help me with a series of real estate paintings I\'d\r\ngot an order for. Big aerial views of land developments, and drawings of\r\nbuildings, roads and causeways, that kinda stuff. Was a little too much\r\nfor me to handle alone, \'cause I never studied that kinda things, ya\r\nknow. I thought he\'d do the mechanical drawings, which shoulda been\r\nsimple for anybody trained that way, and I\'d throw in the colors,\r\nfigures and trees and so on. He did fine. Job came out good; client was\r\nreal happy. We made a pretty good amount on the job, enough to keep us\r\nfor a coupla months without working afterwards. I took it easy, fishing\r\nand so on, but Carter stayed here in the studio working on his own\r\nstuff. I let him keep an eye on things for me around the place, and just\r\ndropped in now and then to check up.\r\n\r\nThe guy was nuts on the subject of perspective. I thought he knew all\r\nthere was to know about it already, but he claimed _nobody_ knew\r\nanything about it, really. Said he\'d been studying it for years, and the\r\nmore he learned about it the more there was to learn. He used to cover\r\nbig sheets of paper with complicated diagrams trying to prove something\r\nor other to himself. I\'d come into the studio and find him with thumb\r\ntacks and strings and stuff all over the place. He\'d get big long rulers\r\nand draw lines to various points all over the room, and end up with a\r\nlittle drawing of a cube about an inch square that anybody coulda made\r\nin a half a minute without all the apparatus. Seemed pretty silly to me.\r\n\r\nThen he brought in some books on mathematics and physics and other\r\nthings, and a bunch of slide rules, calculators, and junk. He musta been\r\na pretty smart guy to know how to handle all those things, even if he\r\nwas kinda dopey about other things. You know ... women and fishing and\r\nsports and drinking; he was lousy at everything except working those\r\nperspective problems. Personally, I couldn\'t see much sense to what he\r\nwas doing. The guy could draw all right already, so I asked him what\r\nmore did he want? Lemme see if I can remember what he said.\r\n\r\n"I\'m trying to get at things as they really are, not as they appear," he\r\nsaid. I think those were his words. "Art is an illusion, a bag of\r\ntricks. Reality is something else, not what we _think_ it is. Drawings\r\nare two-dimensional projections of a world that is not merely three- but\r\nfour-dimensional, if not more," he said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYeh, kind of a crackpot, Carter was. Just on that one subject, though;\r\nnice enough guy otherwise. 

Here, look at some of the drawings he made,\r\nworking out his formulas. Nice designs, huh? Might make good wall paper\r\nor fabric patterns. Real abstract ... that\'s what people seem to like.\r\nSee all those little letters scattered around among the lines? Different\r\nkinds of vanishing points, they are. Carter claimed the whole world was\r\nfull of vanishing points. You don\'t know what a vanishing point is?\r\nLemme see if I can explain. Come over to the window here.\r\n\r\nYa see how that road out there gets smaller and smaller in the distance?\r\nOf course the road doesn\'t really get smaller--it just looks that way.\r\nThat\'s what we call a vanishing point in drawing. Simple, isn\'t it?\r\nNever could understand why Carter went to so much trouble working out\r\nall those ways to locate vanishing points. Me, I just throw \'em in\r\nwherever I need \'em. But Carter claimed that was wrong. Said they were\r\nall connected together some way, and he was gonna work out a method to\r\nprove it.\r\n\r\nHere ... here\'s a little gadget he made up to help his calculations.\r\nBunch of disks all pivoted together at the center; you\'re supposed to\r\nturn \'em around so the arrows point to the different figures and things.\r\nHere\'s the square root sign, I remember Carter telling me that. This one\r\nis the Tangent Function, whatever that means. Log, there, is short for\r\nlogarithm. Oh, he had a bunch of that scientific stuff in his head all\r\nthe time; dunno whether he understood it all himself. He built this\r\nthing just before he put together the perspective machine there.\r\n\r\nSilly-looking gadget, huh? All them pipes and wires and that little cube\r\nin the center ... don\'t try to touch it, it ain\'t really there. 

You just\r\nthink it is. It\'s what Carter called a teteract, or a cataract ... no,\r\nthat ain\'t the right word. Somepin\' like that--tesser something or\r\nother. 

There\'s a picture like it in one of Carter\'s books. Hurts your\r\neyes to look at it, don\'t it?\r\n\r\nThat\'s what Carter thought was going to make him a lot of fame and\r\nmoney, that perspective machine. I told him nobody\'d ever made a drawing\r\nmachine yet that worked, but he said it wasn\'t supposed to make\r\ndrawings. It was just supposed to give people a view of what reality\r\nreally is, instead of what they think it is. I dunno whether he expected\r\nto charge money to look through it, or whether he was gonna look through\r\nit himself and make some new kinda drawings and sell \'em.\r\n\r\nNo, I can\'t tell you how it works--I said before I don\'t know. Carter\r\nonly used it once himself. I came in here the day he finished it, just\r\nas he was ready to turn it on. He was just putting the finishing touches\r\non it.\r\n\r\n"In a few minutes," he told me, "I\'ll have the answer to a question that\r\nmay never have been answered before: what is reality? Is the world a\r\nthing by itself, and all we know illusion? Why do things grow smaller\r\nthe farther away from us they appear? Why can\'t we see more than one\r\nside of anything at a time? What happens to the far side of an object;\r\ndoes it cease to exist just because we can\'t see it? Are objects not\r\npresent nonexistent? Because artists draw things vanishing to points,\r\ndoes that mean that they really vanish?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA wack, that\'s what he was. 

Nice guy, but sorta screwy. He kept saying\r\nmore goofy things while he was finishing up the machine, about how he\'d\r\nfigured out that all we knew about vision and drawing and so on must be\r\nwrong, and that once he got a look at the real world he\'d prove it.\r\n\r\n"How about cameras?" I asked him. "Take a picture with a camera and it\r\nlooks just about the same as a drawing, don\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s because cameras are built to take pictures like we\'re used to\r\nseeing them," he said. "Flat, two-dimensional slices of reality, without\r\ndepth or motion."\r\n\r\n"Even 3-D moving pictures?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"They\'re closer to reality," he admitted. "But they are still only cross\r\nsections of it. The shutter of a movie camera is closed as much of the\r\ntime as it is open. What happens in between the times it\'s open?\r\n\r\n"You know," he went on, "people used to think matter and motion were\r\ncontinuous, but scientists have proved that they are discontinuous. Now\r\nsome of them think time may be, too. Maybe everything is just imaginary,\r\nand appears to our senses in whatever way we want it to appear. We are\r\nso well-trained that we see everything just as we are taught to see it\r\nby generations of artists, writers, and other symbol-makers. If we could\r\nsee things as they really are, what might happen?"\r\n\r\n"We\'d probably all go nuts!" I told him. 

He just smiled.\r\n\r\n"Well, here goes," he said. "It\'s finished. Now to find out who is\r\nright, the scientists and philosophers who say reality is forever\r\nunreachable, or the artists who say there isn\'t any reality--that we\r\nmake the whole thing up to suit ourselves."\r\n\r\nHe moved one of those pointers you see there, and squinted around at the\r\ndifferent scales and dials, and then stepped back. That little\r\ntessy-thing appeared, real small at first. Just a point; you could\r\nhardly see it. I couldn\'t see anything else happening, and thought he\r\nwas gonna do somepin\' else to the machine. I turned to look at Carter,\r\nand saw his face was white as a sheet.\r\n\r\n"Good Gawd!" he says, just like that: "Good Gawd!" That\'s all.\r\n\r\n"Well," I says to him, "who was right, the scientists or the artists?"\r\n\r\n"The artists!" he sorta screeches. "The artists were right all the time\r\n... there _is_ no reality! It\'s all a fabric of illusion we\'ve created\r\nourselves! 

And now I\'ve ripped a hole in that!

"\r\n\r\nHe gives a strangled hoot and goes hightailin\' outta here like somepin\'\r\nwas after him. Jumps in his car and roars off down the road and\r\ndisappears.\r\n\r\nNaw, I don\'t mean he really disappeared--are you nuts? Just roared on\r\ndown the road till he got so small I couldn\'t see him no more. 

You\r\nknow--the way things do when they go farther and farther away. Happens\r\nevery day; that\'s what us artists mean by perspective.\r\n\r\nThe machine? Well, I dunno what to do with it. If Carter ever comes back\r\nhe might not like my getting rid of it. I was thinking mebbe I\'d put it\r\nin the hobby show at the county fair next week, though. Ya notice how\r\nthat funny-looking cube inside there gets bigger every time you look at\r\nit? There ... it just doubled its size again, see? People at the fair\r\noughtta get a big kick outta that. No telling how big it\'ll get with all\r\nthose people looking at it.\r\n\r\nBut come on, let\'s go fishing. We\'d better hurry or it\'ll be too late.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Astounding Science Fiction_ July 1959.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

Mattup\'s face was purple and his eyes looked\r\nlike wolves\' eyes. He glared at Danny, making a noise in his throat, and\r\nthen I saw his gaze leave Danny and go to something down by the reactor.\r\n\r\nIt was Uncle Pete, shuffling along toward the control room.\r\n\r\nMattup didn\'t say a word. He stood up and unholstered the thing the\r\nOutsiders had given him and pointed it at Uncle Pete. There was a\r\nringing in our ears and Uncle Pete began to twist. Something inside him\r\ntwisted him, twisting inside his arms, his legs, head, trunk, even his\r\nfingers. It was only for a few seconds. Then the ringing stopped, and\r\nUncle Pete sunk to the ground, and there was the silence and the smell.\r\n\r\nMattup made us leave the body there until we had played two more hands.\r\nDanny won one; he was a man with good nerves. When we were back in our\r\nroom he said, "That did it--I\'m going to get that guy."\r\n\r\n"I hate his big thick guts," I said, buttoning my pajama shirt, "but how\r\nare you going to get him?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll get him," said Danny. 

"Meanwhile, we\'ll keep playing cards."\r\n\r\nThings went on almost normally at the Bayless reactor. It was a\r\nprivately-owned pool-type reactor, and we were sent samples of all sorts\r\nof material for irradiation from all over the country. Danny was one of\r\nthe irradiation men; I generally handled controlling. The Outsiders had\r\nfilled the place with telescreens and guards, and all mail was opened,\r\nbut there was no real interference with the work. I began to worry a\r\nlittle about Danny. Almost every afternoon he spent an hour alone in our\r\nroom, with the door closed.\r\n\r\nMattup kept getting worse; an animal with power. He used to go hunting\r\nwith the damnable Outsider weapon, although the meat killed with it\r\nwasn\'t fit to eat, and he used it on birds until there wasn\'t one left\r\nanywhere near the plant. He never killed a bluebird, though. He said it\r\nwas bad luck. Sometimes he drank moonshine corn liquor, usually alone,\r\nbecause the Outsiders wouldn\'t touch it, but sometimes he made some of\r\nus drink with him, watching sharply to see we didn\'t poison him and\r\ncraftily picking his nose. When he was drunk he was abusive.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne night we were in our room, dead for sleep after a long game, and\r\nDanny said, "Let me show you something."\r\n\r\nHe shuffled the cards, I cut, and he dealt me an ace, king, queen, jack,\r\nten and deuce of spades. He shuffled again and dealt me the same in\r\nhearts.\r\n\r\n"Watch as closely as you can," he grinned. "See if you can catch me."\r\n\r\nI couldn\'t.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been practicing," he said. "I\'m going to get Mattup."\r\n\r\n"What good will it do to beat him in cards? You\'ll only make him sore."\r\nI was relieved to learn what Danny had been doing, alone in our room,\r\nbut this card-sharp angle didn\'t make much sense to me.\r\n\r\n"Who says I\'m going to beat him at cards?" smiled Danny. 

"By the way,\r\ndid you hear the rumor? They\'re going to break up the staff, Outsider\r\npolicy, send us to Oak Ridge, Argonne, Shippingport, send new people\r\ndown here."\r\n\r\n"That doesn\'t leave you much time," I said.\r\n\r\n"Time enough," said Danny.\r\n\r\nThe next night Mattup began a fantastic streak of luck. It seemed he\r\ncouldn\'t lose, and he was as unpleasant a winner as he was a loser.\r\n\r\n"You boys don\'t know what card-playin\' is," he\'d gloat. "Think you\'re\r\npretty smarty with all that science stuff but you can\'t win a plain old\r\ncard game. You know why you can\'t beat me, boys?"\r\n\r\n"Because you\'re too smart, I guess," said Danny.\r\n\r\n"Well, yeah, and somethin\' else. I dipped my hands in spunk water, up on\r\nthe mountain where you can never find it, and besides that I spit on\r\never\' card in this deck and wiped it off. Couldn\'t lose now to save my\r\nlife."\r\n\r\n"Maybe you\'re right," said Danny, and went on dealing.\r\n\r\nIn a few days the rumor of moving was confirmed; I was being sent to Oak\r\nRidge, Danny to Argonne. Mattup kept winning, and "suggested" that we\r\nraise the stakes. By the day that we were to leave we owed him every\r\ncent we had.\r\n\r\nI paid up soberly; I wouldn\'t give Mattup any satisfaction by\r\ncomplaining. It looked as though Danny wasn\'t going to "get" Mattup\r\nafter all. But Danny surprised me.\r\n\r\n"Look, buster," he wheedled. "If I pay you seventy-five bucks I won\'t\r\nhave a cent left. How about me paying half now and the rest later?"\r\n\r\n"No good," said Mattup. "You got it--pay me. If you can\'t pay cash gimme\r\nyour watch. I know you got one."\r\n\r\n"Look, buster--"\r\n\r\n"Quit callin\' me buster."\r\n\r\n"What am I going to live on until I get paid again?

"\r\n\r\n"What do I care?"\r\n\r\nIt went on like that until the busses for the airport were nearly ready\r\nto leave and both men seemed angry enough to kill each other.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s go," I begged Danny. "Pay him and leave."\r\n\r\n"All right then!" Danny snapped, and pulled out his wallet. He counted\r\nout all his bills into Mattup\'s hand.\r\n\r\n"You\'re a buck short," said Mattup.\r\n\r\n"Why not forget the buck?" said Danny. "You can spare it."\r\n\r\n"You\'re a buck short," repeated Mattup, scowling.\r\n\r\nDanny dashed his wallet to the ground. "You\'re even taking my change!"\r\nHe got his jacket from the back of a chair--it was a hot day--and\r\nemptied change from the side pocket.\r\n\r\nThere were two quarters and a half dollar, and he paid them over. "I\r\nhave eleven cents left," he said. "Hell, take that too. 

I don\'t give a\r\ndamn."\r\n\r\nMattup grinned. "Sure I\'ll take it--if you weren\'t lying when you said I\r\ncould have it."\r\n\r\n"It\'ll break me," said Danny.\r\n\r\n"I know it," said Mattup. "Gonna break your promise?"\r\n\r\nThe bus driver was honking. "The hell with you," Danny said to Mattup,\r\nand gave him a dime and a penny. He looked Mattup in the eye with a\r\nstrange expression. "Now, I gave you that and you didn\'t win it. You\r\ntook it of your own free will. I offered it to you and you took it.\r\nRight?"\r\n\r\n"Right," said Mattup. 

"Sucker."\r\n\r\nWe scrambled on the bus and as it pulled away Danny yelled "Hey, Buster,\r\nlook!" Mattup looked, and Danny stuck his right arm out the window,\r\npointing at Mattup with his right forefinger and his little finger stuck\r\nout straight and parallel, the thumb tucked under. A strange, disturbed\r\nlook came over Orley. He turned his back as the bus roared out of the\r\ndrive.\r\n\r\nAt the airport Danny popped into a phone-booth and got Orley on the\r\nline--nobody seemed to care, either Outsiders or guards--and he let me\r\nlisten.\r\n\r\n"Spent your money yet, dead man?" purred Danny.\r\n\r\n"Whacha mean, dead man?" gruffed Orley\'s voice. 

"You crazy or\r\nsomething?"\r\n\r\n"You know that eleven cents extra you took?" gloated Danny. "It\'s gonna\r\nkill you, Buster, for killing Uncle Pete, and for everything else you\'ve\r\ndone. I know. I\'ve been talking nights to Uncle Pete. You\'re a dead\r\nduck, Orley Mattup! Dead!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s--I don\'t believe it, it\'s baloney! I\'m going to spend that\r\neleven cents and get rid of it."\r\n\r\n"You do exactly that, Buster. I locked the curse on it, and I made the\r\nsign on you, and you have to keep that eleven cents the rest of your\r\nlife. If you spend it--or if you lose it, and you will lose it--that\'s\r\nthe end of you.

"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll come out there and pound the hell out of you!" yelled Mattup.\r\n\r\n"Too late, Buster, our planes are leaving. Goodbye, dead man!

"\r\n\r\nAnd we had to run for our planes. Danny\'s pitch sounded pretty weak to\r\nme, even though Orley was superstitious, but I didn\'t get to tell Danny\r\nthat until nearly five years later.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"I think I got him," said Danny. "You don\'t know the whole thing."\r\n\r\nA hotel clerk had been listening. "You mean Orley Mattup, the guard? He\r\ngot sick, and said he had a hex on him, and took off one day and a lot\r\nlater they found him up on the mountain. He was dead."\r\n\r\n"Any money on him?" asked Danny.\r\n\r\n"Jest some change. They buried it with him; they heard the hex was\r\nlocked onto that money."\r\n\r\n"Congratulations," I told Danny. 

"I didn\'t think it\'d work. You scared\r\nhim to death."\r\n\r\n"Not quite," said Danny. "I scared him into hanging onto the money. That\r\nmoney would have killed anybody that carried it much longer than the few\r\nminutes I handled it. I\'d been keeping the stuff in the reactor beam\r\ntubes. 

It was radioactive as hell."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Imagination Stories of Science and\r\n    Fantasy_ April 1958. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence\r\n    that the U.S.

Garfield jammed down the\r\naccelerator, had a sense of sick helplessness at the complete lack of\r\nresponse from the motor. The Packard rolled on, getting rid of its\r\nmomentum, and came to a stop.\r\n\r\nPhil Garfield swore shakily. He checked his watch, switched off the\r\nheadlights and climbed out into the dark road. 

A delay of even half an\r\nhour here might be disastrous. It was past midnight, and he had another\r\nhundred and ten miles to cover to reach the small private airfield where\r\nMadge waited for him and the thirty thousand dollars in the suitcase on\r\nthe Packard's front seat.\r\n\r\nIf he didn't make it before daylight....\r\n\r\nHe thought of the bank guard. The man had made a clumsy play at being a\r\nhero, and that had set off the fool woman who'd run screaming into their\r\nline of fire. 

One dead. 

Perhaps two. Garfield hadn't stopped to look at\r\nan evening paper.\r\n\r\nBut he knew they were hunting for him.\r\n\r\nHe glanced up and down the road. No other headlights in sight at the\r\nmoment, no light from a building showing on the forested hills. He\r\nreached back into the car and brought out the suitcase, his gun, a big\r\nflashlight and the box of shells which had been standing beside the\r\nsuitcase. He broke the box open, shoved a handful of shells and the .38\r\ninto his coat pocket, then took suitcase and flashlight over to the\r\nshoulder of the road and set them down.\r\n\r\nThere was no point in groping about under the Packard's hood. When it\r\ncame to mechanics, Phil Garfield was a moron and well aware of it. The\r\ncar was useless to him now ... except as bait.\r\n\r\nBut as bait it might be very useful.\r\n\r\nShould he leave it standing where it was? No, Garfield decided. To\r\nanybody driving past it would merely suggest a necking party, or a drunk\r\nsleeping off his load before continuing home. He might have to wait an\r\nhour or more before someone decided to stop. 

He didn't have the time. He\r\nreached in through the window, hauled the top of the steering wheel\r\ntowards him and put his weight against the rear window frame.\r\n\r\nThe Packard began to move slowly backwards at a slant across the road.\r\nIn a minute or two he had it in position. Not blocking the road\r\nentirely, which would arouse immediate suspicion, but angled across it,\r\nlights out, empty, both front doors open and inviting a passerby's\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nGarfield carried the suitcase and flashlight across the right-hand\r\nshoulder of the road and moved up among the trees and undergrowth of the\r\nslope above the shoulder. Placing the suitcase between the bushes, he\r\nbrought out the .38, clicked the safety off and stood waiting.\r\n\r\nSome ten minutes later, a set of headlights appeared speeding up Route\r\nTwelve from the direction of Redmon. Phil Garfield went down on one knee\r\nbefore he came within range of the lights. Now he was completely\r\nconcealed by the vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe car slowed as it approached, braking nearly to a stop sixty feet\r\nfrom the stalled Packard. There were several people inside it; Garfield\r\nheard voices, then a woman's loud laugh. The driver tapped his horn\r\ninquiringly twice, moved the car slowly forward. As the headlights went\r\npast him, Garfield got to his feet among the bushes, took a step down\r\ntowards the road, raising the gun.\r\n\r\nThen he caught the distant gleam of a second set of headlights\r\napproaching from Redmon. He swore under his breath and dropped back out\r\nof sight. The car below him reached the Packard, edged cautiously around\r\nit, rolled on with a sudden roar of acceleration.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe second car stopped when still a hundred yards away, the Packard\r\ncaught in the motionless glare of its lights. Garfield heard the steady\r\npurring of a powerful motor.\r\n\r\nFor almost a minute, nothing else happened. Then the car came gliding\r\nsmoothly on, stopped again no more than thirty feet to Garfield's left.\r\nHe could see it now through the screening bushes--a big job, a long, low\r\nfour-door sedan. The motor continued to purr. After a moment, a door on\r\nthe far side of the car opened and slammed shut.\r\n\r\nA man walked quickly out into the beam of the headlights and started\r\ntowards the Packard.\r\n\r\nPhil Garfield rose from his crouching position, the .38 in his right\r\nhand, flashlight in his left. If the driver was alone, the thing was now\r\ncinched! But if there was somebody else in the car, somebody capable of\r\nfast, decisive action, a slip in the next ten seconds might cost him the\r\nsedan, and quite probably his freedom and life. Garfield lined up the\r\n.38's sights steadily on the center of the approaching man's head. He\r\nlet his breath out slowly as the fellow came level with him in the road\r\nand squeezed off one shot.\r\n\r\nInstantly he went bounding down the slope to the road. The bullet had\r\nflung the man sideways to the pavement. Garfield darted past him to the\r\nleft, crossed the beam of the headlights, and was in darkness again on\r\nthe far side of the road, snapping on his flashlight as he sprinted up\r\nto the car.\r\n\r\nThe motor hummed quietly on. The flashlight showed the seats empty.\r\nGarfield dropped the light, jerked both doors open in turn, gun pointing\r\ninto the car's interior. Then he stood still for a moment, weak and\r\nalmost dizzy with relief.\r\n\r\nThere was no one inside. The sedan was his.\r\n\r\nThe man he had shot through the head lay face down on the road, his hat\r\nflung a dozen feet away from him. Route Twelve still stretched out in\r\ndark silence to east and west. 

There should be time enough to clean up\r\nthe job before anyone else came along. Garfield brought the suitcase\r\ndown and put it on the front seat of the sedan, then started back to get\r\nhis victim off the road and out of sight. He scaled the man's hat into\r\nthe bushes, bent down, grasped the ankles and started to haul him\r\ntowards the left side of the road where the ground dropped off sharply\r\nbeyond the shoulder.\r\n\r\nThe body made a high, squealing sound and began to writhe violently.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShocked, Garfield dropped the legs and hurriedly took the gun from his\r\npocket, moving back a step. The squealing noise rose in intensity as the\r\nwounded man quickly flopped over twice like a struggling fish, arms and\r\nlegs sawing about with startling energy. Garfield clicked off the\r\nsafety, pumped three shots into his victim's back.\r\n\r\nThe grisly squeals ended abruptly. The body continued to jerk for\r\nanother second or two, then lay still.\r\n\r\nGarfield shoved the gun back into his pocket. 

The unexpected\r\ninterruption had unnerved him; his hands shook as he reached down again\r\nfor the stranger's ankles. Then he jerked his hands back, and\r\nstraightened up, staring.\r\n\r\nFrom the side of the man's chest, a few inches below the right arm,\r\nsomething like a thick black stick, three feet long, protruded now\r\nthrough the material of the coat.\r\n\r\nIt shone, gleaming wetly, in the light from the car. Even in that first\r\nuncomprehending instant, something in its appearance brought a surge of\r\nsick disgust to Garfield's throat. Then the stick bent slowly halfway\r\ndown its length, forming a sharp angle, and its tip opened into what\r\ncould have been three blunt, black claws which scrabbled clumsily\r\nagainst the pavement. Very faintly, the squealing began again, and the\r\nbody's back arched up as if another sticklike arm were pushing\r\ndesperately against the ground beneath it.\r\n\r\nGarfield acted in a blur of horror. He emptied the .38 into the thing at\r\nhis feet almost without realizing he was doing it. Then, dropping the\r\ngun, he seized one of the ankles, ran backwards to the shoulder of the\r\nroad, dragging the body behind him.\r\n\r\nIn the darkness at the edge of the shoulder, he let go of it, stepped\r\naround to the other side and with two frantically savage kicks sent the\r\nbody plunging over the shoulder and down the steep slope beyond. He\r\nheard it crash through the bushes for some seconds, then stop. He\r\nturned, and ran back to the sedan, scooping up his gun as he went past.\r\nHe scrambled into the driver's seat and slammed the door shut behind\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHis hands shook violently on the steering wheel as he pressed down the\r\naccelerator. The motor roared into life and the big car surged forward.\r\nHe edged it past the Packard, cursing aloud in horrified shock, jammed\r\ndown the accelerator and went flashing up Route Twelve, darkness racing\r\nbeside and behind him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_What had it been?_ Something that wore what seemed to be a man's body\r\nlike a suit of clothes, moving the body as a man moves, driving a man's\r\ncar ... roach-armed, roach-legged itself!\r\n\r\nGarfield drew a long, shuddering breath. Then, as he slowed for a curve,\r\nthere was a spark of reddish light in the rear-view mirror.\r\n\r\nHe stared at the spark for an instant, braked the car to a stop, rolled\r\ndown the window and looked back.\r\n\r\nFar behind him along Route Twelve, a fire burned. Approximately at the\r\npoint where the Packard had stalled out, where something had gone\r\nrolling off the road into the bushes....\r\n\r\nSomething, Garfield added mentally, that found fiery automatic\r\ndestruction when death came to it, so that its secrets would remain\r\nunrevealed.\r\n\r\nBut for him the fire meant the end of a nightmare. He rolled the window\r\nup, took out a cigarette, lit it, and pressed the accelerator....\r\n\r\nIn incredulous fright, he felt the nose of the car tilt upwards,\r\nheadlights sweeping up from the road into the trees.\r\n\r\nThen the headlights winked out. Beyond the windshield, dark tree\r\nbranches floated down towards him, the night sky beyond. He reached\r\nfrantically for the door handle.\r\n\r\nA steel wrench clamped silently about each of his arms, drawing them in\r\nagainst his sides, immobilizing them there. Garfield gasped, looked up\r\nat the mirror and saw a pair of faintly gleaming red eyes watching him\r\nfrom the rear of the car. Two of the things ... the second one stood\r\nbehind him out of sight, holding him. They'd been in what had seemed to\r\nbe the trunk compartment. 

And they had come out.\r\n\r\nThe eyes in the mirror vanished. A moist, black roach-arm reached over\r\nthe back of the seat beside Garfield, picked up the cigarette he had\r\ndropped, extinguished it with rather horribly human motions, then took\r\nup Garfield's gun and drew back out of sight.\r\n\r\nHe expected a shot, but none came.\r\n\r\nOne doesn't fire a bullet through the suit one intends to wear....\r\n\r\nIt wasn't until that thought occurred to him that tough Phil Garfield\r\nbegan to scream. He was still screaming minutes later when, beyond the\r\nwindshield, the spaceship floated into view among the stars.\r\n\r\nEND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Note:\r\n\r\nThis etext was produced from _Worlds of If_ January 1962.

There was work to do. Wayne must be hidden. The next to\r\ncome must never know. And it should be done quickly. Time would fly and\r\nin the last hours the fear would return. He knew that. Right now his\r\ntriumph sustained him.\r\n\r\nThere was the broadcast to look forward to. A billion people waited for\r\nhis words. It was a sop to his ego, but it could not make him forget\r\nthat this was costing him his life. On occasion, Thurmon could be\r\nrealistic, and he knew that, when there was nothing left to do but sit\r\nand wait for the end, he would be afraid. Terribly, hideously afraid\r\nand alone. It was the only flaw in his plan for immortality. Yet, his\r\nlife had been a barren thing, devoid of love or any real success. It\r\nwas little enough to trade. And this was his only chance for lasting\r\nfame. He could not let it go.\r\n\r\nThe plan was working ... almost of its own inertia. He was alone.\r\nHe was on the Moon, where no man had ever been before him. Not even\r\nWayne. Wayne, who designed the rocket and guided it. Wayne, who had\r\nstolen every chance Thurmon had ever had for recognition! Well, Wayne\r\nwas dead now. He had never put a living foot on the soil of the Moon.\r\nOnly Thurmon had done that. And it was his passport to eternal glory!\r\nNo one, _no one_ could take that away from him! Weighed in the loaded\r\nbalance of his mind, it more than compensated for dying alone and on\r\nan alien world. In fact, even the dying would add to the legends, and\r\nThurmon would live forever. The first man on the Moon!\r\n\r\nHe ran his tongue over dry lips and stooped to pick up the thing at his\r\nfeet. Wayne\'s corpse was still bloated from internal pressures, and the\r\nnaked flesh was drying fast to a parchment-like consistency. Moisture\r\nwas still seeping in awful little globules from the shattered skull\r\nwhere Thurmon\'s unseen blow had landed.\r\n\r\nThurmon found himself shuddering. The murder had been the hardest\r\npart ... but now it was done ... and all that remained was to give his\r\ndead companion a secret resting-place somewhere in the vast expanse of\r\npumice that lay out there under the blistering sun....\r\n\r\nThurmon\'s unsteady mind swerved from high elation to sadness. Poor\r\nWayne! 

He felt he could afford to be generous now. 

So many years of\r\nwork so soon to be forgotten. Just one quick blow, and poor, poor Wayne\r\nslipped into the limbo of the Earth\'s forgotten....\r\n\r\nUnder the light gravity, he carried the naked, grisly bundle easily.\r\nAnd, as he walked out into the Mare Tranquilitatis, his spirits rose\r\nagain. How wonderful it was to be certain that no one could steal his\r\ntriumph! Not even Wayne. 

Particularly not Wayne. He looked down at the\r\nthing in his arms and chuckled. The sound was uncanny within the pyrex\r\nbubble of his helmet.\r\n\r\nAfter what seemed a long time, Thurmon stopped and set down his burden.\r\nWith his pack-spade he set to work digging a trench in the pumice. As\r\nhe dug, he found himself crooning happily to the corpse. His voice was\r\nhigh-pitched and hysterical, but of course he did not notice it.\r\n\r\n"There, there ... Wayne, old friend ... see? I am making a grave for\r\nyou. The very first grave, Wayne ... and you shall have it, old friend!\r\nYours the grave and mine the glory!" He laughed hilariously at the\r\nthought. "I\'ll say you didn\'t make it alive. You didn\'t, did you? But\r\n_I_ made it, Wayne. _Me!_ Alone ... all alone! With no help from you,\r\ndo you hear?"\r\n\r\nThurmon chattered on, the sound of his crazed voice dying within the\r\nconfines of his helmet, while all around him the eternal silence of the\r\nSea of Serenity continued unbroken. The stars shown steadily in the\r\nairless sky, and the sun flamed in impotent splendor, furiously silent.\r\n\r\nAt last the pit was done, and Thurmon lowered the nude corpse into\r\nthe shadows. "Goodbye, Wayne. 

You see, you shouldn\'t have come here\r\nwith me. You shouldn\'t have tried to steal my success. That was a\r\nwrong thing. But you\'re sorry now, aren\'t you, old friend? Don\'t feel\r\ntoo badly, Wayne. I\'ll join you soon. Goodbye, Wayne. Goodbye...."\r\nLaboriously, he shoveled pumice into the pit and tamped it down with\r\nhis leaded boots. Then he smoothed the surface of the dig until it was\r\nas smooth as the rest of the surrounding plain. Satisfied, he turned\r\nhis back on the grave and started for the rocket.\r\n\r\nHe sang on the way back, so happy was he to have done with his ghastly\r\ncompanion. Recklessly prodigal of his oxygen supply, he ran toward the\r\nopen valve of the ship. Breath coming hard, he stumbled into the rocket\r\nand across the buckled deck-plates to the radarphone. The tiny atomic\r\nbatteries hummed as he removed the cadmium dampers. Power flickered the\r\nneedles of the main set. Thurmon adjusted the selector to "relay" and\r\ntuned in his suit radio. Then he returned to sit in the open valve and\r\ncall the monitoring station.\r\n\r\nHe smiled with satisfaction as the response cut through the blanket of\r\nhissing solar static.\r\n\r\n"Hello! Hello, ES-1! 

This is White Sands! My Lord, we\'d given you up\r\nfor lost! 

Where are you?"\r\n\r\nThurmon took a steadier grip on his dancing mind and replied:\r\n\r\n"Listen carefully. Carefully, you understand? This is John Thurmon. I\r\nam on the westernmost edge of the Sea of Serenity on the Moon. Wayne\r\nis dead ... he didn\'t make it. Died during acceleration and I had to\r\ndispose of his body in space. Did you get that? 

I am alone here. The\r\nship crashed on landing. I can\'t get back ... but it\'s worth it! I\r\nhaven\'t much time left ... but I want everyone to know that I made it.\r\nIt will be easier now for others ... after I\'ve pointed the way. I\'m\r\nthe _first_ and it\'s worth it! Did you get that?

"\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence. Finally, the radarman spoke respectfully.\r\n"Yes, Thurmon, we got that. Your transmission is being shunted onto the\r\ncommercial bands. Can you tell us what you see up there? And ... and\r\nThurmon, we all want you to know that our prayers are with you." Tears\r\nwere flowing on Earth now, Thurmon knew. Tears for a martyr to science\r\ndoomed to death alone on an alien world. He smiled thinly. Even this\r\ntiny taste of deference and respect was heady wine to his frustrated\r\npsyche.\r\n\r\nThurmon stepped through the valve and lowered himself to the plain. His\r\nheart was pounding triumphantly. Carefully, painstakingly, he began\r\nto describe his surroundings, interspersing his words with scientific\r\ndata. He played the hero well. There was no hysteria recognizable in\r\nhis voice ... and, if it trembled slightly, there was reason enough for\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nHe rounded the bulge of the rocket\'s nose and looked for the first\r\ntime at the western edge of the Mare. In the near distance an\r\nirregularly-shaped outcropping of rock caught his eye. Transmitting as\r\nhe went, he made his way toward it.... He drew nearer. And as he did,\r\nfear began to stir within him. 

His steps faltered, but some awful\r\npower drew him on. His voice became a shrill rasp in his ears, and on\r\nEarth a billion people gasped with horror....\r\n\r\n"_Wayne!_"\r\n\r\nThurmon shouted the name in fear and threw his arm over his face. But\r\nthe thing remained. It was _real_!\r\n\r\n"_Wayne ... no!_ IT CAN\'T BE! NO...."\r\n\r\nBut the figure did not move. The vast colossus loomed stark white and\r\nnaked in the brilliant sunlight. Legs apart, arms folded on its breast,\r\nit stared with brooding eyes at the vast emptiness of the lunar plain.\r\n\r\nThurmon howled with terror and fury.\r\n\r\n"Damn you! _Damn you!_ Why don\'t you answer me? 

I killed you once ...\r\nI\'ll kill you again! I\'m the first one here! Do you hear me? I\'ll kill\r\nyou again!"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "_Why don\'t you answer me? 

I killed you once!_"]\r\n\r\nHe lowered his head and charged. The last thing he remembered was the\r\nsoundless tinkle of his shattering helmet, and the terrible pain as his\r\nskull cracked under the suddenly shifting pressures....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"... _And strangely enough, the story of the race\'s first conquest\r\nof space is the story of one man, Sargon, the Lemurian Immortal, who\r\nled his people to the Moon in the misty past of Earth\'s youth. The\r\nLemurians are gone now, but on the westernmost edge of the Sea of\r\nSerenity there stands a statue of Sargon. It stands in magnificent\r\nisolation, a monument to the first man on the Moon._"\r\n\r\n                     Essays on Tellurian History,\r\n                      Quintus Bland, Geneva Keep\r\n                           Press, 12.50 Cr.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


"Oh brother!"\r\n\r\nHe went to the control chamber of the _Lady Luna_ and ran through his\r\nchecklist almost mechanically. He waited almost breathlessly until the\r\nradio barked the word that told him to hit the ignition switch, and\r\nwhen it came he hit it with a vigor and enjoyed the crushing sensation\r\nthat followed. The thunder from below was music in his ears; now he was\r\non his way and they wouldn\'t call him back.\r\n\r\nHolt was no mere glory machine. Not for him was the simple honor. He\r\nhad it planned, had it planned from the moment he was selected.\r\n\r\nFor Holt, the honor of setting the first foot on another world was a\r\nflat and tasteless award. It would last only until someone else did\r\nsomething slightly better. What could he get out of driving a space\r\nrocket to Luna? Not a hell of a lot. He was not headed for an adventure\r\nand he knew it; with everything precalculated, including the risk, what\r\nadventure could he have? To land and collect a quart of pumice and a\r\npound of rock and maybe a shiny stone. Look for lichen or moss. Listen\r\nto the Geiger.\r\n\r\nThis sort of dry action would sell no books, collect no royalties,\r\nmake no moving pictures, bring in no dough.\r\n\r\nGordon took a deep breath as soon as the motor cut off. He was on his\r\nway and he knew how to handle everything from here on in.\r\n\r\nHe had seen enough of human nature to foresee it all. 

A slight mishap\r\nand a call for help would start it. A landing just hard enough to bend\r\nthe control vanes or to plug up the rocket exhaust. Maybe to dinge up\r\nthe spacecraft enough to make it unspaceworthy. Then--\r\n\r\nThe cry for help and the whole world crying in return that a Human\r\nBeing was marooned out there, helpless and alone.\r\n\r\nThey\'d come.\r\n\r\nThey\'d turn handsprings to get out there. Time and money would be\r\ntossed down the drain, and men would strive and women would cry, and\r\nthe news would be filled with daily columns of how the rescue was\r\nprogressing.\r\n\r\nDrop a man in the ocean and the navies of every country go out and comb\r\nthe sea to find him. Put a cat on the telephone pole and three hundred\r\npeople struggle to get the animal down. Drop a child in a well and the\r\ncountryside turns out en masse to help.\r\n\r\nWell, maroon a man on the moon and watch \'em struggle.\r\n\r\nHe had air for ninety days and food and water and just about anything\r\na man would need. He could sit it out and he knew it. And he knew that\r\nthere was a second rocket that could be put in space within a couple of\r\nmonths. Sixty days he\'d sit it out and then--\r\n\r\nIt would be the story of his life, the tale of his rescue, the bright\r\nlights and the personal appearances. Radio and television and endorsing\r\nthis junk and that googoo. Women and liquor and money.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe came down in the Crater Plato, tail first but far too fast. The\r\ntailfins crumpled and the sifting pumice drove up into the exhaust and\r\npacked like cement. A seam whistled far below to let out some air from\r\na sealed compartment, cracked in the bump.\r\n\r\nThe crash staggered him a bit, but all he suffered was a nosebleed and\r\na set of sprained chest muscles. He sat up and looked around.\r\n\r\nThe radio. He snapped it on and called: "_Lady Luna_ Gordon Holt\r\nreporting. Made a crash landing. May be dangerous. 

Will check and call\r\nat 0300."\r\n\r\nHe eyed the radio thoughtfully; it only took about three seconds for\r\nan answer, but in that time Gordon considered smashing the radio in\r\nthe middle of the next broadcast and then discarded the idea because\r\nit might lead people to think that he, too, had been smashed. Gordon\r\nwanted to be rescued, not given a hero\'s brief hail and farewell.\r\n\r\n"Calling _Lady Luna_. Holt! 

Are you all right? Explain!"\r\n\r\n"I am all right. I am not hurt. Crash landing rather rough but nothing\r\nbroken. No air leakage, nothing completely ruined that I can tell.\r\nLanded as per program in the dead center of Plato, but a little too\r\nhard."\r\n\r\nThat ought to do it. 

Let \'em get excited slowly. They\'ll forget me less\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\n"_Lady Luna_ what happened?" They were worried.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. I have a hunch that the pumice does not provide a true\r\nground-plane for the radar. We landed as though the ground were about\r\nthirty feet below the surface."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat sounds logical. Such things are entirely possible, I\'m told.\r\nPowdery, filmy stuff with no water shouldn\'t have a firm ground-plane.\r\n\r\n"_Lady Luna_ inspect your damage and report as planned at 0300."\r\n\r\nHolt checked his air first. 

Plenty of it. 

Not a bit gone. 

Water next\r\nand food next. He checked the hull as well as he could from the inside\r\nand then went out in his space suit to view the damage.\r\n\r\nHe had done an admirable job. The tail fins were bent messily and the\r\nhull was crumpled a bit just above the place where the rocket motor\r\nended. If this ship took off--\r\n\r\n"_Lady Luna_ calling home. Reporting as per plan. Hull bent, tail fins\r\nruined. Crater filled with powdery pumice and I feel that the exhaust\r\nis packed. Shall I try a blast to clear it?"\r\n\r\nWhile he waited for the answer Gordon found a bit of wire and shorted\r\nthe battery for a second. He had to fade out slowly enough to fool them\r\ncompletely.\r\n\r\n"_Lady Luna_, do not try a clearing blast. You\'ll explode. 

Wait for\r\ninstructions."\r\n\r\n"Will do. 

Will do."\r\n\r\nHe shorted the battery a couple more times and watched the voltmeter\r\ndrop.\r\n\r\n"_Lady Luna_ can you dig down to the exhaust port?"\r\n\r\n"Will try. Note battery dropping. Nothing else in danger. Food, water,\r\nair all okay. Hull sound but battery dropping."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSeconds went on and Holt could see the resources of the entire world\r\ncollecting to prepare the First Spacewreck Rescue. Complete with\r\nvideo, reporters, clergymen, politicians, and humanity waiting.\r\n\r\n"_Lady Luna_ repeat. You are fading."\r\n\r\nHolt repeated, insisting that he was all right. "I can stick it out. 

I\r\ncan stick it out."\r\n\r\nHe watched the radio battery fade.\r\n\r\nLet it fade. He could stand the silence for two months until rescue\r\ncame.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA billion people listened to his voice die away. And when their radio\r\nnetworks went dead, they raced to their telephones and clogged the land\r\nwires demanding that something had to be done.\r\n\r\nCongressmen gave speeches and clergymen spoke and doctors gave opinions\r\nand scientists differed. A government seldom known for its cooperation\r\nannounced that its new atomic-powered rocket was about to effect the\r\nrescue single-handedly. But the atomic part blew up in front of the\r\nvideo cameras and took some of the landscape with it. The Council\r\nof the United Nations called a meeting. The newspapers and networks\r\ncovered everything.\r\n\r\nA man known for his brilliance came on the air.\r\n\r\n"The batteries of the _Lady Luna_ have run down," he said. "We must\r\nget there in less than ten days."\r\n\r\nThey tried to do it.\r\n\r\nA second rocket exploded in France.\r\n\r\nA third blew up in Germany.\r\n\r\nThe fourth would not be ready for space for sixty days.\r\n\r\nThat was seventy long days after Holt\'s landing.\r\n\r\nWithout a miracle, Holt would be dead, even if the experts were wrong.\r\n\r\nProtestants prayed, Catholics crossed themselves, and Mohammedans\r\ncalled it _kismet_ and let it go at that. A scientist suggested that\r\nsince there was no habitable planet in the solar system and that\r\nmankind could never reach the stars, there was small point in this\r\neffort to make space travel pay off. An economist computed the sum of\r\nmoney shelled out already and called it damned foolishness. A Senator\r\nMaculay suggested that taxes could be lowered if such expenditures were\r\ncut out.\r\n\r\nAnd ten days after the accident there was a world-wide prayer said for\r\nGordon Holt.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe other rocket at White Sands grew cobwebs in its empty fuel tanks.\r\n\r\nAnd the _Lady Luna_ slipped into the dark of the moon. It grew colder\r\nand colder as time went on....\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n

]\r\n\r\n\r\n"Your Majesty!"\r\n\r\nD\'hai Merssu, Emperor of All the Suns, Protector of the Galaxy, looked\r\nup calmly as his prime minister burst into the room. His lean, brooding\r\nface did not change expression as he watched the pale and perspiring\r\nman cross the flagstoned floor with a sharp, nervous patter of leather.\r\n\r\n"Gently, Tors, gently," he said quietly, his eyes mocking under their\r\noverhang of dark eyebrow. "You\'re Prime Minister now--remember that.\r\nA prime minister doesn\'t come blundering into the palace looking as\r\nthough the sky was falling. It creates unrest in the population. Try to\r\nremember that we\'re no longer a pair of obscure rabblerousers, trying\r\nto overthrow the Crown. We _are_ the Crown now. Try to act like it.

"\r\n\r\n"D\'hai, the sky _is_ falling!" Tors burst out unheedingly, "I have word\r\nthat the Earthmen are driving beyond the Rim and into the heart of the\r\nEmpire itself! Their ships are irresistible. 

They\'re winning battle\r\nafter battle! And the people are restless! They say it\'s time the False\r\nEmperor\'s rule was overthrown. Some of the garrisons are rebelling!"\r\n\r\nStill the Emperor\'s expression did not change. "So," he said calmly,\r\n"the Earthmen were not bluffing when they said they\'d maintain the\r\nrights of the old Emperor."\r\n\r\n"Yes! You said they wouldn\'t, D\'hai. 

What are we going to do?"\r\n\r\n"I was wrong, Tors," Merssu said evenly. "No matter. 

As for what\r\nwe are going to do, why, I suppose you\'d better arrange for another\r\nbroadcast. Tell the people we have weapons ready if the situation\r\nbecomes serious, that they have nothing to fear."\r\n\r\n"But the situation _is_ serious! And what weapons?"\r\n\r\n"No weapons, Tors," Merssu explained patiently. "But the story will\r\nserve to keep the people calm--and, perhaps, make them think twice\r\nabout revolt. Now go. 

Hurry!"\r\n\r\nThe prime minister\'s feet pattered over the floor again. The door to\r\nthe room closed.\r\n\r\nMerssu smiled quietly. He rose, and opened the concealed door behind\r\nhis chair. Closing it behind him, he slipped into a passage of which\r\nno one knew, and ten minutes later he was in a private tubeway that\r\nled half-way across the continent into the heart of an old and barren\r\nmountain range.\r\n\r\nAs he sat comfortably in the padded upholstery of the tube car, Merssu\r\nsmiled again. Poor Tors! 

So excitable. Always the hysteric--a perfect\r\nrabblerouser, perhaps, but not a clever man. No, never a clever man. A\r\nclever man knew when the game was over. And Merssu laughed.\r\n\r\nThe game had been worth it. Five years ago, he had been a\r\nrevolutionary, slinking through the alleys at night, always in\r\ndanger--and always clever. Four years of that, and then--Empire.\r\nAbsolute rule over the entire Greater Magellanic Cloud. Now he was once\r\nagain in danger. 

But it was a danger he had long ago foreseen, and\r\nplanned for. And the past year had been worth it. He laughed again.\r\nPoor, addle-witted Tors! Left with the empty bag in his hands.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe spaceship rested like a crouching bullet in its chamber. As he slid\r\nthe tubeway door shut behind him, Merssu admired the savage sleekness\r\nof its lines once again. Even more, he admired his cleverness in having\r\nit built. A clever man always has a back door. He crossed the hangar\r\nfloor unhurriedly, and climbed into the ship.\r\n\r\nThe control room was small, but efficient. A hundred controls lay\r\nclosely around the padded chair, some of them for the standard drive,\r\nothers for the hyperspatial warp.\r\n\r\nThe hyperspatial warp! Merssu smiled. There was his escape--and more.\r\nHere were the means for his future rulership over nothing so small as\r\nthe Cloud--here were entire galaxies waiting for his hand.\r\n\r\nHyperspace! There was something to make a man think! Another universe,\r\nnot beyond, but _alongside_ his own, hidden in the complex byways\r\nof Reimannian geometry and the mathematics of Einstein. A universe\r\nwhere time itself ran slower, where a year of normal time encompassed\r\ncenturies. A ship could twist itself into that universe and travel just\r\nbelow the speed of light, the limit which, in normal space, was the\r\nbarrier no ship could cross. But, in hyperspace, while the same barrier\r\nexisted, a man from normal space could travel for centuries, covering\r\ngreat distances, while, for him, only a few months passed.\r\n\r\nMerssu chuckled. Behind him, stored in the great holds of the ship,\r\nwere working models of every machine and weapon the Cloud civilization\r\npossessed. There were plans, manuals, instructions, all translated into\r\nbasic symbology that any intelligent being could understand. Packed\r\ninto this ship was an entire civilization, ready to be brought to\r\nwhatever people Merssu chose. He had only to enter hyperspace and lose\r\nhimself where no Earthman or rebel could follow, and there he would\r\nfind a primitive race, barely beginning to rise out of the mud. He\r\nwould bring them civilization. In return, he would have--Godhood!\r\n\r\nThey would worship him, those primitive people. He would be Merssu\r\nthe Firegod, thundering out of the sky, bringing with him the gift of\r\ncivilization. And once the gift was given, he would climb back into the\r\nsky on a pillar of fire, promising to return when his people were ready.\r\n\r\nHe laughed aloud, the deep bass sound echoing through the control\r\nchamber. Why not? He could fly back into space and spend a year,\r\nwaiting, while centuries passed on the primitive world. When he\r\nreturned, that world would be his, and soon afterward the entire\r\nuniverse would bow before the name of Merssu, the immortal Firegod, for\r\nthere is no force so strong, no loyalty so great, as that of men for\r\ntheir gods.\r\n\r\nStill laughing, he blasted the ship out of its hangar into the darkness\r\nof space, and a little later, into hyperspace, while the big blue ships\r\nof Earth smashed his discarded Empire behind him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a month, he had found his planet, and his people. They were almost\r\nhuman in appearance, but shorter. So much the better. He was like them,\r\nbut just different enough to be a god.\r\n\r\nHe brought his ship roaring down through the atmosphere, trailing a\r\nstreamer of flame. As he passed over the sea that covered most of the\r\nworld, the wash of his jets kicked the water into froth, and the sound\r\nof his passage echoed through the sky.\r\n\r\nThe village rested on the shore of the sea. The mud huts trembled as\r\nhis ship sank down, resting on its jetstream until it settled slowly to\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nSmiling faintly, Merssu put on his spacesuit, strapping his antigravity\r\nharness on over it. He flew out of his upper airlock, carrying a gun in\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\nHe hovered in the air above the village. He pointed the gun into the\r\nair and fired. 

A cone of flame shot toward the sky. He pointed the\r\ngun at the sea, and towering curtains of steam rose to hang over the\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\nMerssu descended, and found his people groveling in the mud.\r\n\r\nWeeks passed. A stream of men carried the ship\'s cargo into a great\r\nsprawling building that Merssu carved out of a stone cliff with a\r\nsubatomic cutter. The lintels of the building were sanctified with\r\nthe blood of virgins. A new class of people arose in the village--the\r\nPriests of Merssu, the Firegod.\r\n\r\nAnd as the ship rose up into space again, on its journey back into the\r\nnormal space where Merssu would wait his year and the centuries would\r\npass for his people, the priests chanted over their altars.\r\n\r\n"He will return. Merssu goes to his kingdom in the sky, but he will\r\nreturn, bearing flame in his hands. Merssu the Firegod--Merssu, the\r\nimmortal Bringer of Fire--will return."\r\n\r\nAnd the centuries passed.\r\n\r\nMerssu brought his ship out of the sky, tearing the air as he came, the\r\ngrowl of his jets thundering over the mighty city on the sea. The sound\r\nechoed back from the carved face of the Temple of Merssu, and beat\r\nagainst the spreading buildings.\r\n\r\nThe ship settled to earth. Merssu strapped on his antigrav unit, and\r\nflashed out into the air above the city. He fired his gun into the sea,\r\nand the steam-curtain rose once more. He pointed the gun skyward, and\r\nthe heavens danced with flame.\r\n\r\nA low, snarling car bearing the sign of Merssu\'s priesthood drove up to\r\nhim as he touched the ground. Two men got out and walked toward him,\r\none of them dressed in the somber black of the priesthood. Merssu stood\r\nwaiting, his eyes lighting with triumphant fire.\r\n\r\n"Who are you?" the priest asked.\r\n\r\nMerssu stared, the pose broken. "Who am I? 

Kneel, fool! I am Merssu,\r\nthe Firegod."\r\n\r\nThe two men looked at him speechlessly for a moment, then burst into\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\n"Merssu!" The priest wiped his eyes. The other man\'s laughter trailed\r\ninto anger.\r\n\r\n"Watch your tongue, blasphemer!" he said curtly, drawing a gun from his\r\nholster.\r\n\r\n"Merssu!" the priest repeated, "You\'re the fool, stranger. At least\r\nthe others who\'ve tried to claim his godhood had the sense to disguise\r\nthemselves to resemble his pictures."\r\n\r\n"Pictures change, rash priest!" Merssu thundered. "I am the Firegod!\r\nLook on my power!" Once more he fired into the sea, and once more the\r\nsteam pillars rose. "I am the God of Fire. I fly in the hands of flame.\r\nI walk on the air. I burn the land and the sea. I am Merssu!"\r\n\r\nThe priest\'s face lost its tolerant amusement. His mouth twisted in\r\nscorn.\r\n\r\n"Walk on the air, do you? In a Mark XI Antigrav belt, yes. Burn sea and\r\nland, eh? With a sungun, certainly. Fly in hands of flame? If you wish\r\nto be picturesque about it, yes--but so does every drunken fool of a\r\nspaceman."\r\n\r\n"_I tell you, I am Merssu!_" Merssu screamed. "_Bow down and worship!_"\r\n\r\n"_Silence!_" The priest\'s voice was dangerous, "You will come with us\r\nto the temple. There you\'ll see how we worship imposters!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll kill you!" Merssu shouted, raising his gun.\r\n\r\nThe priest motioned with his hand. The man with him blew Merssu\'s head\r\noff.\r\n\r\n"Blasphemer!" the priest spat disdainfully, his voice filled with\r\ndisgust. He and his retainer turned back to the car, leaving the body\r\nto be carted away later.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEvery evening at sunset, the priests of Merssu stand over their altars\r\nand intone the words.\r\n\r\n"He will return. Merssu the Firegod--Merssu, the immortal Bringer of\r\nFire--will return."\r\n\r\nAnd the people of Merssu\'s world intone in reply, "He will return."\r\nThroughout the galaxies of hyperspace, wherever the men of Merssu\'s\r\nworld may wander, there are other priests, and other races that\r\nrespond, but the ritual is always the same.\r\n\r\n"He will return."\r\n\r\nAnd the city waits. The planet waits, and the other planets about the\r\nother stars through all the galaxies of hyperspace wait.\r\n\r\nThey always will.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


It isn\'t comfortable; but of course they expect to\r\nmake me still more uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nThey expect to take me out of this precinct jail to the District prison\r\nand eventually to the death house.\r\n\r\nSure, there will be a trial first, but that is only a formality. Not\r\nonly did they catch me with the smoking gun in my hand and Connaught\r\nbubbling to death through the hole in his throat, but I admitted it.\r\n\r\nI--knowing what I was doing, with, as they say, malice\r\naforethought--deliberately shot to death Laurence Connaught.\r\n\r\nThey execute murderers. So they mean to execute me.\r\n\r\nEspecially because Laurence Connaught had saved my life.\r\n\r\nWell, there are extenuating circumstances. I do not think they would\r\nconvince a jury.\r\n\r\nConnaught and I were close friends for years. We lost touch during the\r\nwar. 

We met again in Washington, a few years after the war was over. We\r\nhad, to some extent, grown apart; he had become a man with a mission.\r\nHe was working very hard on something and he did not choose to discuss\r\nhis work and there was nothing else in his life on which to form a basis\r\nfor communication. And--well, I had my own life, too. It wasn\'t\r\nscientific research in my case--I flunked out of med school, while he\r\nwent on. I\'m not ashamed of it; it is nothing to be ashamed of. I simply\r\nwas not able to cope with the messy business of carving corpses. 

I\r\ndidn\'t like it, I didn\'t want to do it, and when I was forced to do it,\r\nI did it badly. So--I left.\r\n\r\nThus I have no string of degrees, but you don\'t need them in order to be\r\na Senate guard.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDoes that sound like a terribly impressive career to you? Of course not;\r\nbut I liked it. The Senators are relaxed and friendly when the guards\r\nare around, and you learn wonderful things about what goes on behind the\r\nscenes of government. And a Senate guard is in a position to do\r\nfavors--for newspapermen, who find a lead to a story useful; for\r\ngovernment officials, who sometimes base a whole campaign on one\r\ncareless, repeated remark; and for just about anyone who would like to\r\nbe in the visitors\' gallery during a hot debate.\r\n\r\nLarry Connaught, for instance. I ran into him on the street one day, and\r\nwe chatted for a moment, and he asked if it was possible to get him in\r\nto see the upcoming foreign relations debate. 

It was; I called him the\r\nnext day and told him I had arranged for a pass. And he was there,\r\nwatching eagerly with his moist little eyes, when the Secretary got up\r\nto speak and there was that sudden unexpected yell, and the handful of\r\nCentral American fanatics dragged out their weapons and began trying to\r\nchange American policy with gunpowder.\r\n\r\nYou remember the story, I suppose. There were only three of them, two\r\nwith guns, one with a hand grenade. The pistol men managed to wound two\r\nSenators and a guard. I was right there, talking to Connaught. I spotted\r\nthe little fellow with the hand grenade and tackled him. I knocked him\r\ndown, but the grenade went flying, pin pulled, seconds ticking away. I\r\nlunged for it. Larry Connaught was ahead of me.\r\n\r\nThe newspaper stories made heroes out of both of us. They said it was\r\nmiraculous that Larry, who had fallen right on top of the grenade, had\r\nmanaged to get it away from himself and so placed that when it exploded\r\nno one was hurt.\r\n\r\nFor it did go off--and the flying steel touched nobody. The papers\r\nmentioned that Larry had been knocked unconscious by the blast. He was\r\nunconscious, all right.\r\n\r\nHe didn\'t come to for six hours and when he woke up, he spent the next\r\nwhole day in a stupor.\r\n\r\nI called on him the next night. He was glad to see me.\r\n\r\n"That was a close one, Dick," he said. "Take me back to Tarawa."\r\n\r\nI said, "I guess you saved my life, Larry."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, Dick! I just jumped. Lucky, that\'s all."\r\n\r\n"The papers said you were terrific. They said you moved so fast, nobody\r\ncould see exactly what happened."\r\n\r\nHe made a deprecating gesture, but his wet little eyes were wary.\r\n"Nobody was really watching, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"I was watching," I told him flatly.\r\n\r\nHe looked at me silently for a moment.\r\n\r\n"I was between you and the grenade," I said. "You didn\'t go past me,\r\nover me, or through me. But you were on top of the grenade."\r\n\r\nHe started to shake his head.\r\n\r\nI said, "Also, Larry, you fell _on_ the grenade. It exploded underneath\r\nyou. I know, because I was almost on top of you, and it blew you clear\r\noff the floor of the gallery. Did you have a bulletproof vest on?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe cleared his throat. "Well, as a matter of--"\r\n\r\n"Cut it out, Larry! What\'s the answer?"\r\n\r\nHe took off his glasses and rubbed his watery eyes. He grumbled, "Don\'t\r\nyou read the papers? It went off a yard away."\r\n\r\n"Larry," I said gently, "I was there."\r\n\r\nHe slumped back in his chair, staring at me. Larry Connaught was a small\r\nman, but he never looked smaller than he did in that big chair, looking\r\nat me as though I were Mr. Nemesis himself.\r\n\r\nThen he laughed. 

He surprised me; he sounded almost happy. He said,\r\n"Well, hell, Dick--I had to tell somebody about it sooner or later. Why\r\nnot you?"\r\n\r\nI can\'t tell you all of what he said. I\'ll tell most of it--but not the\r\npart that matters.\r\n\r\nI\'ll never tell _that_ part to _anybody_.\r\n\r\nLarry said, "I should have known you\'d remember." He smiled at me\r\nruefully, affectionately. "Those bull sessions in the cafeterias, eh?\r\nTalking all night about everything. 

But you remembered."\r\n\r\n"You claimed that the human mind possessed powers of psychokinesis," I\r\nsaid. "You argued that just by the mind, without moving a finger or\r\nusing a machine, a man could move his body anywhere, instantly. You said\r\nthat nothing was impossible to the mind."\r\n\r\nI felt like an absolute fool saying those things; they were ridiculous\r\nnotions. Imagine a man _thinking_ himself from one place to another!\r\nBut--I had been on that gallery.\r\n\r\nI licked my lips and looked to Larry Connaught for confirmation.\r\n\r\n"I was all wet," Larry laughed. "Imagine!"\r\n\r\nI suppose I showed surprise, because he patted my shoulder.\r\n\r\nHe said, becoming sober, "Sure, Dick, you\'re wrong, but you\'re right\r\nall the same. The mind alone can\'t do anything of the sort--that was\r\njust a silly kid notion. But," he went on, "_but_ there are--well,\r\ntechniques--linking the mind to physical forces--simple physical forces\r\nthat we all use every day--that can do it all. Everything! Everything I\r\never thought of and things I haven\'t found out yet.\r\n\r\n"Fly across the ocean? In a second, Dick! Wall off an exploding bomb?\r\nEasily! You saw me do it. 

Oh, it\'s work. It takes energy--you can\'t\r\nescape natural law. That was what knocked me out for a whole day. 

But\r\nthat was a hard one; it\'s a lot easier, for instance, to make a bullet\r\nmiss its target. It\'s even easier to lift the cartridge out of the\r\nchamber and put it in my pocket, so that the bullet can\'t even be fired.\r\nWant the Crown Jewels of England? I could get them, Dick!

"\r\n\r\nI asked, "Can you see the future?"\r\n\r\nHe frowned. "That\'s silly. This isn\'t supersti--"\r\n\r\n"How about reading minds?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLarry\'s expression cleared. "Oh, you\'re remembering some of the things I\r\nsaid years ago. No, I can\'t do that either, Dick. Maybe, some day, if I\r\nkeep working at this thing-- Well, I can\'t right now. There are things I\r\ncan do, though, that are just as good."\r\n\r\n"Show me something you can do," I asked.\r\n\r\nHe smiled. Larry was enjoying himself; I didn\'t begrudge it to him. He\r\nhad hugged this to himself for years, from the day he found his first\r\nclue, through the decade of proving and experimenting, almost always\r\nbeing wrong, but always getting closer.... He _needed_ to talk about it.\r\nI think he was really glad that, at last, someone had found him out.\r\n\r\nHe said, "Show you something? Why, let\'s see, Dick." He looked around\r\nthe room, then winked. "See that window?

"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI looked. It opened with a slither of wood and a rumble of sash weights.\r\nIt closed again.\r\n\r\n"The radio," said Larry. There was a _click_ and his little set turned\r\nitself on. "Watch it."\r\n\r\nIt disappeared and reappeared.\r\n\r\n"It was on top of Mount Everest," Larry said, panting a little.\r\n\r\nThe plug on the radio\'s electric cord picked itself up and stretched\r\ntoward the baseboard socket, then dropped to the floor again.\r\n\r\n"No," said Larry, and his voice was trembling, "I\'ll show you a hard\r\none. Watch the radio, Dick. 

I\'ll run it without plugging it in! The\r\nelectrons themselves--"\r\n\r\nHe was staring intently at the little set. I saw the dial light go on,\r\nflicker, and hold steady; the speaker began to make scratching noises. I\r\nstood up, right behind Larry, right over him.\r\n\r\nI used the telephone on the table beside him. I caught him right beside\r\nthe ear and he folded over without a murmur. Methodically, I hit him\r\ntwice more, and then I was sure he wouldn\'t wake up for at least an\r\nhour. I rolled him over and put the telephone back in its cradle.\r\n\r\nI ransacked his apartment. I found it in his desk: All his notes. All\r\nthe information. The secret of how to do the things he could do.\r\n\r\nI picked up the telephone and called the Washington police. When I heard\r\nthe siren outside, I took out my service revolver and shot him in the\r\nthroat. He was dead before they came in.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor, you see, I knew Laurence Connaught. We were friends. I would have\r\ntrusted him with my life. But this was more than just a life.\r\n\r\nTwenty-three words told how to do the things that Laurence Connaught\r\ndid. Anyone who could read could do them. Criminals, traitors,\r\nlunatics--the formula would work for anyone.\r\n\r\nLaurence Connaught was an honest man and an idealist, I think. But what\r\nwould happen to any man when he became God? Suppose you were told\r\ntwenty-three words that would let you reach into any bank vault, peer\r\ninside any closed room, walk through any wall? Suppose pistols could not\r\nkill you?\r\n\r\nThey say power corrupts; and absolute power corrupts absolutely. And\r\nthere can be no more absolute power than the twenty-three words that can\r\nfree a man of any jail or give him anything he wants. Larry was my\r\nfriend. But I killed him in cold blood, knowing what I did, because he\r\ncould not be trusted with the secret that could make him king of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nBut I can.\r\n\r\n                                                       --FREDERIK POHL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Galaxy Science Fiction_ February 1955.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

"\r\n\r\n"Got here as soon as I could. I wager half my time was taken up by the\r\nsecurity check points. You are certainly isolated in here."\r\n\r\n"All of that," agreed the general. "Have a seat, won\'t you?" he asked,\r\nindicating a chair.\r\n\r\nHis friend sank into it gratefully. "Now, what\'s this vital problem you\r\ncalled me about? 

You weren\'t too specific."\r\n\r\n"No," said Garvers, "I wasn\'t. This is a security matter, after a\r\nfashion. It\'s vitally important that we get technical help on this\r\nthing, and since you and I are friends, I was asked to call you in."\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid I\'ll have to make a story of it."\r\n\r\n"Quite all right by me, but don\'t mind if I interject a question now and\r\nthen. Mind if I smoke?"\r\n\r\n"Go right ahead," said Garvers, fumbling out a lighter. "Just don\'t\r\nspill ashes on the rug.\r\n\r\n"This all began on the Third of May. I was working here on some\r\ntop-security stuff. 

I had suddenly got the feeling of being watched. I\r\nknow it seems silly, what with all the check points that a potential spy\r\nwould have to go through to get here, but that\'s just how I felt.\r\n\r\n"Several times I glanced around the office, but of course it was empty.\r\nThen I began to think that it was my nerves."\r\n\r\n"You always were a bit of a hypochondriac," observed his friend.\r\n\r\n"Be that as it may," continued Garvers, "it was the only explanation I\r\nhad at the time. Either someone was watching me, which seemed\r\nimpossible, or I was beginning to crack under the strain.\r\n\r\n"Well, I put my papers away and tried to take a short break. I was\r\nreaching into my drawer where I keep magazines when, so help me, a man\r\nstepped out of the wall into my office."\r\n\r\n"What? It seems as if you just said a guy stepped out of the wall."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just what I did say. It sounds crazy, but let me finish, will\r\nyou? I\'m not kidding, and I\'ll show you proof later if necessary.\r\n\r\n"Anyway, this bird stepped straight out of the wall as if it had been a\r\nwaterfall or something, but the wall itself was undamaged. The only\r\nproof I had that he had actually done it was the fact that he was in my\r\noffice, but that was proof enough.\r\n\r\n"To put it mildly, I was thunderstruck. After jumping to my feet, I\r\ncould only stand there like an idiot. I was so shaken that I couldn\'t\r\nspeak a word. But he spoke first.\r\n\r\n"\'General Garvers?\' he asked, just as if he had run into me at a\r\ncocktail party or on the street.\r\n\r\n"I told him he was correct, and asked him who _he_ was and what he\r\nwanted. And how he got into my office.\r\n\r\n"He identified himself as a Henry Busch and explained that he was acting\r\nin behalf of a good friend of his, the late Dr. Hymann Duvall. Have you\r\never heard of Duvall, Max?"\r\n\r\nHis friend twisted his face in thought. 

"Can\'t say that I have,\r\noff-hand. 

But the name seems to ring a bell somewhere."\r\n\r\n"Well, anyway, he said that Duvall had perfected an invention of great\r\nnational importance shortly before his death and asked Busch to deliver\r\nit to the government if anything should happen to him. Then Duvall died\r\nsuddenly of a heart attack."\r\n\r\n"And what was this invention?"\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it obvious? A machine that would enable a man to walk through\r\nwalls. And Busch has no idea how the thing works, other than the general\r\nexplanation that Duvall gave him. And Busch was poles apart from Duvall.\r\nThey were friends from college, but not because of professional\r\ninterests. It seems they were both doublecrossed by the same girl.\r\n\r\n"Duvall was a brilliant but obscure nuclear and radiation physicist. He\r\nwas one of those once-in-a-lifetime fellows like Tesla. He was so shy\r\nthat he didn\'t bring himself to anybody\'s attention, save for a few\r\npapers he published in the smaller physical societies\' magazines. It was\r\nonly because he had inherited a considerable amount of money that he\r\ncould do any research whatsoever."\r\n\r\n"Hm-m-m. I seem to remember a paper about wave propagation in one of the\r\nquarterlies. Quite unorthodox, as I recall," said Max.\r\n\r\n"Could be. But anyway, about Busch.\r\n\r\n"Busch majored in psychology at college, but took special courses after\r\nhe graduated and took a Master\'s in English. He has written two novels\r\nand three collections of poems under various pen names. At the time of\r\nDuvall\'s death, he was working on the libretto of an opera. He has had\r\nno technical training, unless you want to count a year of high school\r\ngeneral science. So he wasn\'t too much help in explaining how Duvall\'s\r\ninstrument works.\r\n\r\n"And, just to make matters more juicy, Duvall kept no notes. He had\r\ntotal recall and a childlike fear of putting anything into writing that\r\nhad not been experimentally verified."\r\n\r\n"And this machine, how is it supposed to work?"\r\n\r\n\r\nGarvers got up and began to pace. "According to Busch, Duvall devised\r\nthe instrument after stumbling into an entirely new branch of physics.\r\n\r\n"This device of Duvall\'s is a special case of a new theory of matter and\r\nenergy. Matter is made up of subnuclear particles--electrons, protons\r\nand the like. However, Duvall said that these particles are in turn made\r\nup of much smaller particles grouped together in aggregate clouds. The\r\nsize ratio of these particles to protons is somewhat like the ratio of\r\nan individual proton to a large star. They seem to be composed of tiny\r\nclots of energy from a fantastically complex energy system, in which\r\nelectromagnetism is but a small part. Each energy-segment is represented\r\nby a different facet of each particle, and the arrangement of the\r\nindividual particles to each other determines what super-particle they\r\nwill form, such as an electron. Duvall called these sub-particles\r\n\'lems\'.\r\n\r\n"Busch says he was told that a field of a special nature could be\r\ngenerated so as to make the individual lems in the particles of matter\r\nrotate in a special way that would introduce a \'polarization field\', as\r\nDuvall called it. This field seems to be connected somehow with gravity,\r\nbut Busch wasn\'t told how.\r\n\r\n"The upshot is that matter in the _initial_ presence of the field is\r\naffected so that it is able to pass through ordinary matter--"\r\n\r\n"Hold on," interrupted Max. "If a device can do that, then the user\r\nwould immediately fall towards the center of the Earth."\r\n\r\n"Just _you_ hold on. 

You didn\'t let me finish. A single plane of atoms,\r\nat the base of the treated object is the point of contact. It remains\r\npartially unaffected because it is closest to the \'gravetostatic field\r\ncenter\', which I guess is the Earth\'s center of attraction. This plane\r\nof \'semi-treated\' atoms can be forced through an object, if it is moved\r\nhorizontally, but its \'untreated\' aspect prevents the subject wearing\r\nthe device from falling through the floor.\r\n\r\n"Busch demonstrated this device to me, turning it on and strolling\r\nthrough various objects in this room. Think of it! 

No soldier could be\r\nkilled or held prisoner. And--"\r\n\r\n"Now hang on," objected Max. "Let\'s not run away with ourselves. He may\r\nhave perfected a device that would enable a soldier to avoid capture,\r\nbut there would certainly be other ways to kill him than by bullets.\r\nLet\'s see now: suppose that the enemy shot a flamethrower at him. The\r\nburning materials might pass through him, but he would be cooked anyway.\r\nOr poison gas--"\r\n\r\n"Hm-m-m. As far as gas goes, I suppose a gas mask would be necessary.\r\nBusch doesn\'t know about the breathing mechanism, except that he had to\r\ntake breaths. But as far as fire or radiation goes, the man\'s protected.\r\nIf the radiation is either harmful by nature or by amount, the field\r\nmerely reflects it. It is something called the \'lemic stress\' of the\r\nfield that causes the phenomenon.\r\n\r\n"That\'s why we need your help."\r\n\r\nMax scratched his head thoughtfully. 

"I don\'t understand.

"\r\n\r\nGarvers looked pained. "When Busch had finished his demonstration, he\r\ncarelessly tossed the device on my desk. The thing skidded and hit my\r\npaperweight so that the switch was thrown on again. So now the device\r\nand my desk are both untouchable.\r\n\r\n"Go over to the desk and try to touch it," said Garvers dryly.\r\n\r\nHis friend got up and ambled over to the desk. There he saw a small\r\nblack box resting near a paperweight. Its toggle switch was at the "on"\r\nposition, and it was lying on its side. He tried to pick the box up, but\r\nhis hand slid effortlessly through it as if it were so much air.\r\n\r\n"_Well_!" Max said. He passed his hand through the desk again. "Well,\r\nwell. Are you sure Busch told you everything?"\r\n\r\n"Busch! He honestly wants to help and we have taken him through the\r\nmill. Pentathol, scopolamine and the like; hypnotism and the polygraph.\r\nWe\'ve dug that man deeper than we have ever dug anybody before."\r\n\r\n"And have you conducted any experiments of your own?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly. That\'s what is so frustrating. We try to X ray the thing,\r\nand we don\'t get a thing. We bombarded it with every radiation we could\r\nthink of, from radio to gamma and it just reflected them. We can detect\r\nno radiation coming out of it. Magnetic fields don\'t effect it, nor do\r\nheat and cold. Nuclear particles are ignored by it; it just _sits_ there\r\nthumbing its nose at us. And we can\'t even wait for it to run down.\r\nAccording to Busch, the power requirements of the thing are funny and\r\nonce the field is established, it takes no additional energy to maintain\r\nit. And the collapsing power remains indefinitely until it is time to\r\nturn the machine off, but it\'s unreachable by any means we have.\r\n\r\n"It\'s pure frustration. There\'s no way we can analyze it until we can\r\nhandle it, and no way we can handle it until we can turn it off. 

And\r\nthere\'s no way we can turn it off until we have analyzed it. If it were\r\nalive, I\'d think that it was laughing at us.\r\n\r\n"Do _you_ have any ideas?" asked Garvers hopefully.\r\n\r\n"Nothing that would help a solution at present," said Max. "But do you\r\nremember the legend of King Tantalus?"\r\n\r\n"Slightly. What about it?

"\r\n\r\n"Well ... if _he_ were here," said Max thoughtfully, "he\'d ...\r\nsympathize."\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n


Biff Hawton was too sophisticated to be awed. He stayed on\r\nbecause he wanted to find out what the trick was that made the gadget\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all explained right here in your instruction book," the\r\ndemonstrator said, holding up a garishly printed booklet opened to a\r\nfour-color diagram. "You all know how magnets pick up things and I bet\r\nyou even know that the earth itself is one great big magnet--that\'s why\r\ncompasses always point north. Well ... the Atomic Wonder Space Wave\r\nTapper hangs onto those space waves. Invisibly all about us, and even\r\ngoing right through us, are the magnetic waves of the earth. The Atomic\r\nWonder rides these waves just the way a ship rides the waves in the\r\nocean. Now watch...."\r\n\r\nEvery eye was on him as he put the gaudy model rocketship on top of the\r\ntable and stepped back. It was made of stamped metal and seemed as\r\nincapable of flying as a can of ham--which it very much resembled.\r\nNeither wings, propellors, nor jets broke through the painted surface.\r\nIt rested on three rubber wheels and coming out through the bottom was a\r\ndouble strand of thin insulated wire. This white wire ran across the top\r\nof the black table and terminated in a control box in the demonstrator\'s\r\nhand. An indicator light, a switch and a knob appeared to be the only\r\ncontrols.\r\n\r\n"I turn on the Power Switch, sending a surge of current to the Wave\r\nReceptors," he said. The switch clicked and the light blinked on and off\r\nwith a steady pulse. Then the man began to slowly turn the knob. "A\r\ncareful touch on the Wave Generator is necessary as we are dealing with\r\nthe powers of the whole world here...."\r\n\r\nA concerted _ahhhh_ swept through the crowd as the Space Wave Tapper\r\nshivered a bit, then rose slowly into the air. The demonstrator stepped\r\nback and the toy rose higher and higher, bobbing gently on the invisible\r\nwaves of magnetic force that supported it. Ever so slowly the power was\r\nreduced and it settled back to the table.\r\n\r\n"Only $17.95," the young man said, putting a large price sign on the\r\ntable. "For the complete set of the Atomic Wonder, the Space Tapper\r\ncontrol box, battery and instruction book ..."\r\n\r\nAt the appearance of the price card the crowd broke up noisily and the\r\nchildren rushed away towards the operating model trains. The\r\ndemonstrator\'s words were lost in their noisy passage, and after a\r\nmoment he sank into a gloomy silence. He put the control box down,\r\nyawned and sat on the edge of the table. Colonel Hawton was the only one\r\nleft after the crowd had moved on.\r\n\r\n"Could you tell me how this thing works?" the colonel asked, coming\r\nforward. The demonstrator brightened up and picked up one of the toys.\r\n\r\n"Well, if you will look here, sir...." He opened the hinged top. "You\r\nwill see the Space Wave coils at each end of the ship." With a pencil he\r\npointed out the odd shaped plastic forms about an inch in diameter that\r\nhad been wound--apparently at random--with a few turns of copper wire.\r\nExcept for these coils the interior of the model was empty. The coils\r\nwere wired together and other wires ran out through the hole in the\r\nbottom of the control box. Biff Hawton turned a very quizzical eye on\r\nthe gadget and upon the demonstrator who completely ignored this sign of\r\ndisbelief.\r\n\r\n"Inside the control box is the battery," the young man said, snapping it\r\nopen and pointing to an ordinary flashlight battery. "The current goes\r\nthrough the Power Switch and Power Light to the Wave Generator ..."\r\n\r\n"What you mean to say," Biff broke in, "is that the juice from this\r\nfifteen cent battery goes through this cheap rheostat to those\r\nmeaningless coils in the model and absolutely nothing happens. Now tell\r\nme what really flies the thing. 

If I\'m going to drop eighteen bucks for\r\nsix-bits worth of tin, I want to know what I\'m getting."\r\n\r\nThe demonstrator flushed. "I\'m sorry, sir," he stammered. "I wasn\'t\r\ntrying to hide anything. Like any magic trick this one can\'t be really\r\ndemonstrated until it has been purchased." He leaned forward and\r\nwhispered confidentially. "I\'ll tell you what I\'ll do though. This\r\nthing is way overpriced and hasn\'t been moving at all. The manager said\r\nI could let them go at three dollars if I could find any takers. If you\r\nwant to buy it for that price...."\r\n\r\n"Sold, my boy!" the colonel said, slamming three bills down on the\r\ntable. "I\'ll give that much for it no matter _how_ it works. The boys in\r\nthe shop will get a kick out of it," he tapped the winged rocket on his\r\nchest. "Now _really_--what holds it up?"\r\n\r\nThe demonstrator looked around carefully, then pointed. "Strings!" 

he\r\nsaid. "Or rather a black thread. It runs from the top of the model,\r\nthrough a tiny loop in the ceiling, and back down to my hand--tied to\r\nthis ring on my finger. When I back up--the model rises. 

It\'s as simple\r\nas that."\r\n\r\n"All good illusions are simple," the colonel grunted, tracing the black\r\nthread with his eye. "As long as there is plenty of flimflam to distract\r\nthe viewer."\r\n\r\n"If you don\'t have a black table, a black cloth will do," the young man\r\nsaid. "And the arch of a doorway is a good site, just see that the room\r\nin back is dark."\r\n\r\n"Wrap it up, my boy, I wasn\'t born yesterday. 

I\'m an old hand at this\r\nkind of thing."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBiff Hawton sprang it at the next Thursday-night poker party. The gang\r\nwere all missile men and they cheered and jeered as he hammed up the\r\nintroduction.\r\n\r\n"Let me copy the diagram, Biff, I could use some of those magnetic waves\r\nin the new bird!"\r\n\r\n"Those flashlight batteries are cheaper than lox, this is the thing of\r\nthe future!"\r\n\r\nOnly Teddy Kaner caught wise as the flight began. He was an amateur\r\nmagician and spotted the gimmick at once. He kept silent with\r\nprofessional courtesy, and smiled ironically as the rest of the bunch\r\ngrew silent one by one. The colonel was a good showman and he had set\r\nthe scene well. He almost had them believing in the Space Wave Tapper\r\nbefore he was through. When the model had landed and he had switched it\r\noff he couldn\'t stop them from crowding around the table.\r\n\r\n"A thread!" one of the engineers shouted, almost with relief, and they\r\nall laughed along with him.\r\n\r\n"Too bad," the head project physicist said, "I was hoping that a little\r\nSpace Wave Tapping could help us out. Let me try a flight with it."\r\n\r\n"Teddy Kaner first," Biff announced. "He spotted it while you were all\r\nwatching the flashing lights, only he didn\'t say anything."\r\n\r\nKaner slipped the ring with the black thread over his finger and started\r\nto step back.\r\n\r\n"You have to turn the switch on first," Biff said.\r\n\r\n"I know," Kaner smiled. "But that\'s part of illusion--the spiel and the\r\nmisdirection. I\'m going to try this cold first, so I can get it moving\r\nup and down smoothly, then go through it with the whole works.

"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ILLUSTRATED BY BREY]\r\n\r\nHe moved his hand back smoothly, in a professional manner that drew no\r\nattention to it. The model lifted from the table--then crashed back\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n"The thread broke," Kaner said.\r\n\r\n"You jerked it, instead of pulling smoothly," Biff said and knotted the\r\nbroken thread. "Here let me show you how to do it.

"\r\n\r\nThe thread broke again when Biff tried it, which got a good laugh that\r\nmade his collar a little warm. Someone mentioned the poker game.\r\n\r\nThis was the only time that poker was mentioned or even remembered that\r\nnight. Because very soon after this they found that the thread would\r\nlift the model only when the switch was on and two and a half volts\r\nflowing through the joke coils. With the current turned off the model\r\nwas too heavy to lift. The thread broke every time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"I still think it\'s a screwy idea," the young man said. "One week\r\ngetting fallen arches, demonstrating those toy ships for every brat\r\nwithin a thousand miles. Then selling the things for three bucks when\r\nthey must have cost at least a hundred dollars apiece to make."\r\n\r\n"But you _did_ sell the ten of them to people who would be interested?"\r\nthe older man asked.\r\n\r\n"I think so, I caught a few Air Force officers and a colonel in missiles\r\none day. Then there was one official I remembered from the Bureau of\r\nStandards. Luckily he didn\'t recognize me. Then those two professors you\r\nspotted from the university."\r\n\r\n"Then the problem is out of our hands and into theirs. All we have to do\r\nnow is sit back and wait for results."\r\n\r\n"_What_ results?! These people weren\'t interested when we were hammering\r\non their doors with the proof. We\'ve patented the coils and can prove to\r\nanyone that there is a reduction in weight around them when they are\r\noperating...."\r\n\r\n"But a small reduction. And we don\'t know what is causing it. No one can\r\nbe interested in a thing like that--a fractional weight decrease in a\r\nclumsy model, certainly not enough to lift the weight of the generator.\r\nNo one wrapped up in massive fuel consumption, tons of lift and such is\r\ngoing to have time to worry about a crackpot who thinks he has found a\r\nminor slip in Newton\'s laws."\r\n\r\n"You think they will now?" the young man asked, cracking his knuckles\r\nimpatiently.\r\n\r\n"I _know_ they will. The tensile strength of that thread is correctly\r\nadjusted to the weight of the model. The thread will break if you try to\r\nlift the model with it. Yet you can lift the model--after a small\r\nincrement of its weight has been removed by the coils. This is going to\r\nbug these men. 

Nobody is going to ask them to solve the problem or\r\nconcern themselves with it. But it will nag at them because they know\r\nthis effect can\'t possibly exist. They\'ll see at once that the\r\nmagnetic-wave theory is nonsense. Or perhaps true? 

We don\'t know. 

But\r\nthey will all be thinking about it and worrying about it. Someone is\r\ngoing to experiment in his basement--just as a hobby of course--to find\r\nthe cause of the error. And he or someone else is going to find out what\r\nmakes those coils work, or maybe a way to improve them!"\r\n\r\n"And we have the patents...."\r\n\r\n"Correct. They will be doing the research that will take them out of the\r\nmassive-lift-propulsion business and into the field of pure space\r\nflight."\r\n\r\n"And in doing so they will be making us rich--whenever the time comes to\r\nmanufacture," the young man said cynically.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll all be rich, son," the older man said, patting him on the\r\nshoulder. "Believe me, you\'re not going to recognize this old world ten\r\nyears from now."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Analog_ April 1962.

I\'ll guarantee that it sells, though. 

There\'s nothing like it\r\non any midway."\r\n\r\n"I\'d like to try it out first, of course," Allenby said. "Star-Time uses\r\nonly the very best, you know."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know," Jenkins said. He had heard the line before, from almost\r\nevery carnival buyer to whom he had sold. He did not do much business\r\nwith the carnivals; there weren\'t enough to keep him busy with large or\r\nworthwhile rides and features. The amusement parks of the big cities\r\nwere usually the best markets.\r\n\r\nAllenby warily eyed the entrance, a room fashioned from a side-show\r\nbooth. A rough red curtain concealed the inside. 

Over the doorway, in\r\ncrude dark blue paint, was lettered, "Journey Home." Behind the doorway\r\nwas a large barnlike structure, newly painted white, where Jenkins did\r\nhis planning, his building, and his finishing. When he sold a new ride\r\nit was either transported from inside the building through the large,\r\npull-away doors in back or taken apart piece by piece and shipped to the\r\npark or carny that bought it.\r\n\r\n"Six thousand\'s a lot of money," the buyer said.\r\n\r\n"Just try it," Jenkins told him.\r\n\r\nThe buyer shrugged. "O.K.," he said. 

"Let\'s go in." They walked through\r\nthe red curtain. Inside the booth-entrance was a soft-cushioned\r\neasy-chair, also red, secured firmly in place. It was a piece of salvage\r\nfrom a two-engine commercial airplane. A helmet looking like a Flash\r\nGordon accessory-hair drier combination was set over it. Jenkins flipped\r\na switch and the room became bright with light. "I thought you said this\r\nwasn\'t a thrill ride," Allenby said, looking at the helmetlike structure\r\nominously hanging over the chair.\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t," Jenkins said, smiling. "Sit down." He strapped the buyer\r\ninto place in the chair.\r\n\r\n"Hey, wait a minute," Allenby protested. "Why the straps?"\r\n\r\n"Leave everything to me and don\'t worry," Jenkins said, fitting the\r\nheadgear into place over the buyer\'s head. The back of it fitted easily\r\nover the entire rear of the skull, down to his neck. The front came just\r\nbelow the eyes. After turning the light off, Jenkins pulled the curtain\r\nclosed. It was completely black inside.\r\n\r\n"Have a nice trip," Jenkins said, pulling a switch on the wall and\r\npushing a button on the back of the chair at the same time.\r\n\r\nCurrents shifted and repatterned themselves inside the helmet and were\r\nfed into Allenby at the base of his skull, at the medulla. The currents\r\nof alternating ions mixed with the currents of his varied and random\r\nbrain waves, and the impulses of one became the impulses of the other.\r\nAllenby jerked once with the initial shock and was then still, his mind\r\nand body fused with the pulsating currents of the chair.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, Roger Allenby was almost blinded by bright, naked light.\r\nAllenby\'s first impression was one of disappointment at the failure of\r\nthe device. Jenkins was reliable, usually, and hadn\'t come up with a\r\nfluke yet.\r\n\r\nAllenby got out of the chair and called for Jenkins, holding on to the\r\narm of the chair to keep his bearings. 

"Hey! Where are you? Jenkins!" He\r\ntried to look around him but the bright, intense light revealed nothing.\r\nHe swore to himself, extending his arms in front of him for something to\r\ngrasp. As he groped for a solid, the light became more subdued and\r\nshifted from white into a light, pleasant blue.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShapes and forms rearranged themselves in front of him and gradually\r\nbecame distinguishable. He was in a city, or on top of a city. A\r\npanoramic view was before him and he saw the creations of human beings,\r\nobviously, but a culture far removed from his. A slight path of white\r\nbegan at his feet and expanded as it fell slightly, ramplike, over and\r\ninto the city. The buildings were whiter than the gate of false dreams\r\nthat Penelope sung of and the streets and avenues were blue, not gray.\r\nThe people wore white and milled about in the streets below him. They\r\nshouted as one; their voices were not cries but songs and they sang his\r\nname.\r\n\r\nHe started walking on the white strip. It was flexible and supported his\r\nweight easily. Then he was running, finding his breath coming in sharp\r\ngasps and he was among the crowds. They smiled at him as he passed by\r\nand held out their hands to him. Their faces shone with a brilliance of\r\nawareness and he knew that they loved him. Troubled, frightened, he kept\r\nrunning, blindly, and, abruptly, there were no people, no buildings.\r\n\r\nHe was walking now, at the left side of a modern super-highway, against\r\nthe traffic. Autos sped by him, too quickly for him to determine the\r\nyear of model. Across the divider the traffic was heavier, autos\r\nspeeding crazily ahead in the direction he was walking; none stopped. He\r\nhalted for a moment and looked around him. There was nothing on the\r\nsides of the road: no people, no fields, no farms, no cities, no\r\nblackness. There was nothing. But far ahead there was green etched\r\naround the horizon as the road dipped and the cars sped over it. He\r\nwalked more quickly, catching his breath, and came closer and closer to\r\nthe green.\r\n\r\nAllenby stopped momentarily and turned around, looking at the highway\r\nthat was behind him. It was gone. Only bleak, black and gray hills of\r\nrock and rubble were there, no cars, no life. He shuddered and continued\r\non toward the end of the highway. The green blended in with the blue of\r\nthe sky now. Closer he came, until just over the next rise in the road\r\nthe green was bright. Not knowing or caring why, he was filled with\r\nexpectation and he ran again and was in the meadow.\r\n\r\nAll around him were the greens of the grasses and leaves and the yellows\r\nand blues of the field flowers. It was warm, a spring day, with none of\r\nthe discomfort of summer heat. Jubilant, Roger spun around in circles,\r\ninhaling the fragrance of the field, listening to the hum of insect life\r\nstirring back to awareness after a season of inactivity. Then he was\r\nrunning and tumbling, barefoot, his shirt open, feeling the soft grass\r\ngive way underfoot and the soil was good and rich beneath him.\r\n\r\nHe saw a stream ahead, with clear water melodiously flowing by him. He\r\nwent to it and drank, the cold, good water quenching all his thirst,\r\nclearing all the stickiness of his throat and mind. He dashed the water\r\non his face and was happy and felt the coolness of it as the breeze\r\npicked up and swept his hair over his forehead. With a shake of his head\r\nhe tossed it back in place and ran again, feeling the air rush into his\r\nlungs with coolness and vibrance unknown since adolescence. No nicotine\r\nspasms choked him and the air was refreshing.\r\n\r\nThen up the hill he sped, pushing hard, as the marigolds and dandelions\r\nparted before him. At the top he stopped and looked and smiled\r\necstatically as he saw the green rolling land and the stream, curving\r\naround from behind the house, his house, the oaks forming a secret lair\r\nbehind it, and he felt the youth of the world in his lungs and under his\r\nfeet. He heard the voice calling from that house, his house, calling him\r\nto Saturday lunch.\r\n\r\n"I\'m coming!" he cried happily and was tumbling down the hill, rolling\r\nover and over, the hill and ground and sky blending blues and greens and\r\nnothing had perspective. The world was spinning and everything was black\r\nagain. He shook his head to clear the dizziness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Well?" Jenkins said. 

"How was it?"\r\n\r\nAllenby looked up at him as Jenkins swung the helmet back and unhooked\r\nthe seatbelt. He squinted as Jenkins flipped the light switch and the\r\nbrightness hit him.\r\n\r\nHis surroundings became distinguishable again very slowly and he knew he\r\nwas back in the room. "Where was I?" he asked.\r\n\r\nJenkins shrugged. "I don\'t know. It was all yours. You went wherever you\r\nwanted to go, wherever home is." Jenkins smiled down at him. "Did you\r\nvisit more than one place?" he asked. The buyer nodded. "I thought so.\r\nIt seems that a person tries a few before finally deciding where to go."\r\n\r\nThe buyer stood up and stretched. "Could I please see the barn?" he\r\nasked, meaning the huge workshop where Jenkins did the construction\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n"Sure," Jenkins said and opened the door opposite the red curtain into\r\nthe workshop. It was empty.\r\n\r\n"You mean it was all up here? I didn\'t move at all?" He tapped his\r\ncranium with his index finger.\r\n\r\n"That\'s right," Jenkins said anxiously. "Do you want it or not?"\r\n\r\nAllenby stood looking into the empty room. "Yes ... yes, of course," he\r\nsaid. "How long did the whole thing last?"\r\n\r\n"About ten seconds," Jenkins said, looking at his watch. "It seems much\r\nlonger to the traveler. I\'m not sure, but I think the imagined time\r\nvaries with each person. It\'s always around ten seconds of actual time,\r\nthough, so you can make a lot of money on it, even if you only have one\r\nmachine."\r\n\r\n"Money?" Allenby said. 

"Money, yes, of course." He took a checkbook from\r\nhis inside pocket and hurriedly wrote a check for six thousand dollars.\r\n"When can we have it delivered?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"You want it shipped the usual way?"\r\n\r\n"No," Allenby said, staring at the red-cushioned chair. "Send it air\r\nfreight. 

Then bill us for the expense."\r\n\r\n"Whatever you say," Jenkins said, smiling, taking the check. "You\'ll\r\nhave it by the first of the week, probably. I\'ll put a complete parts\r\nand assembly manual inside the crate."\r\n\r\n"Good, good. 

But maybe I should test it again, you know. Star-Time can\'t\r\nreally afford to make a mistake as expensive as this."\r\n\r\n"No," Jenkins said quickly. Then, "I\'ll guarantee it, of course. If it\r\ndoesn\'t work out, I\'ll give you a full refund. But don\'t try it again,\r\ntoday. 

Don\'t let anyone have it more than once in one day. Stamp them on\r\nthe hand or something when they take the trip."\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\nJenkins looked troubled. "I\'m not sure, but people might not want to\r\ncome back. Too many times in a row and they might be able to stay\r\nthere ... in their minds of course."\r\n\r\n"Of course, of course. Well, it\'s been a pleasure doing business with\r\nyou, Mr. Jenkins. 

I hope to see you again soon." They walked back to\r\nAllenby\'s not-very-late model car and shook hands. Allenby drove away.\r\n\r\nOn the way back to the hotel, and as he lay for a long time in the\r\nbathtub, letting the warmness drift away from the water, the thought ran\r\nover and over in his mind. They might be able to stay there, Allenby\r\nsaid to himself. They might be able to stay there. He smiled warmly at a\r\ncrack in the plaster as he thought of the first of the week and the\r\nfragrant meadow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Analog Science Fact & Fiction_\r\n    November 1963.

Several of the town\'s\r\nministers who had been with him on other issues had balked on this one,\r\nbut he had three of them present, as well as heads of several women\'s\r\nclubs.\r\n\r\nAs he had anticipated, the irresponsible liberals were present to do\r\nbattle, headed by red-haired Patrick Levitt.\r\n\r\n"This board," said Levitt in his strong, sarcastic voice, "has gone too\r\nfar. It was all right to get rid of the actual filth ... and everyone\r\nwill agree there was some. But when you banned the sale of some\r\nmagazines and books because they had racy covers or because the contents\r\nwere a little too sophisticated to suit the taste of members of this\r\nboard ... well, you can carry protection of our youth to the point of\r\ninsulting the intelligence of adults who have a right to read what they\r\nwant to."\r\n\r\n"You\'re talking about something that\'s already in the past, Mr. 

Levitt,"\r\nsaid Montcalm mildly. 

"Let\'s keep to the issue at hand. You won\'t deny\r\nthat children see this indecent statue every day?"\r\n\r\n"No, I won\'t deny it!" snapped Levitt. 

"Why shouldn\'t they see it? They\r\ncan see the plate of the original in the encyclopaedia. It\'s a fine copy\r\nof a work of art."\r\n\r\nMontcalm waited for some rebuttal from his supporters, but none was\r\nforthcoming. On this matter, they apparently were unwilling to go\r\nfarther than the moral backing of their presence.\r\n\r\n"I do not consider the statue of a naked woman art, even if it is called\r\n\'Dawn,\'" he said bitingly. He looked at his two colleagues and received\r\ntheir nods of acquiescence. He ruled: "The statue must be removed from\r\nthe park and from public view."\r\n\r\nLevitt had one parting shot.\r\n\r\n"Would it solve the board\'s problem if we put a brassiere and panties on\r\nthe statue?" he demanded.\r\n\r\n"Mr. 

Levitt\'s levity is not amusing. The board has ruled," said Montcalm\r\ncoldly, arising to signify the end of the meeting.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat night Montcalm slept the satisfied sleep of the just.\r\n\r\nHe awoke shortly after dawn to find a strange, utterly beautiful naked\r\nwoman in his bedroom. For a bemused instant Montcalm thought the statue\r\nof Dawn in the park had come to haunt him. His mouth fell open but he\r\nwas unable to speak.\r\n\r\n"Take me to your President," said the naked woman musically, with an\r\naccent that could have been Martian.\r\n\r\nMrs. Montcalm awoke.\r\n\r\n"What\'s that? 

What is it, Richard?" she asked sleepily.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t look, Millie!" exclaimed Montcalm, clapping a hand over her eyes.\r\n\r\n"Nonsense!" she snapped, pushing his hand aside and sitting up. She\r\ngasped and her eyes went wide, and in an instinctive, unreasonable\r\nreaction she clutched the covers up around her own nightgowned bosom.\r\n\r\n"Who are you, young woman?" demanded Montcalm indignantly. 

"How did you\r\nget in here?"\r\n\r\n"I am a visitor from what you would call an alien planet," she said. "Of\r\ncourse," she added thoughtfully, "it isn\'t alien to me."\r\n\r\n"The woman\'s mad," said Montcalm to his wife. A warning noise sounded in\r\nthe adjoining bedroom. Alarmed, he instructed: "Go and keep the children\r\nout of here until I can get her to put on some clothes. They mustn\'t see\r\nher like this."\r\n\r\nMrs. Montcalm got out of bed, but she gave her husband a searching\r\nglance.\r\n\r\n"Are you sure I can trust you in here with her?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Millie!" exclaimed Montcalm sternly, shocked. She dropped her eyes and\r\nleft the room. When the door closed behind her, he turned to the strange\r\nwoman and said:\r\n\r\n"Now, look, young lady, I\'ll get you one of Millie\'s dresses. You\'ll\r\nhave to get some clothes on and leave."\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t you going to ask me my name?" asked the woman. "Of course, it\'s\r\nunpronounceable to you, but I thought that was the first thing all Earth\r\npeople asked of visitors from other planets."\r\n\r\n"All right," he said in exasperation. "What\'s your name?"\r\n\r\nShe said an unpronounceable word and added: "You may call me Liz."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMontcalm went to the closet and found one of Millie\'s house dresses. He\r\nheld it out to her beseechingly.\r\n\r\nAs he did so, he was stricken with a sudden sharp feeling of regret that\r\nshe must don it. Her figure ... why Millie had never had a figure like\r\nthat! At once, he felt ashamed and disloyal and sterner than ever.\r\n\r\nLiz rejected the proffered garment.\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t think of adopting your alien custom of wearing clothing,"\r\nshe said sweetly.\r\n\r\n"Now look," said Montcalm, "I don\'t know whether you\'re drunk or crazy,\r\nbut you\'re going to have to put something on and get out of here before\r\nI call the police."\r\n\r\n"I anticipated doubt," said Liz. 

"I\'m prepared to prove my identity."\r\n\r\nWith the words, the two of them were no longer standing in the Montcalm\r\nbedroom, but in a broad expanse of green fields and woodland, unmarred\r\nby any habitation. Montcalm didn\'t recognize the spot, but it looked\r\nvaguely like it might be somewhere in the northern part of the state.\r\n\r\nMontcalm was dismayed to find that he was as naked as his companion!\r\n\r\n"Oh, my Lord!" he exclaimed, trying to cover himself with a September\r\nMorn pose.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m sorry," apologized Liz, and instantly Montcalm\'s pajamas were\r\nlying at his feet. He got into them hurriedly.\r\n\r\n"How did we get here?" he asked, his astonished curiosity overcoming his\r\ndisapproval of this immodest woman.\r\n\r\n"By a mode of transportation common to my people in planetary\r\natmospheres," she answered. "It\'s one of the things I propose to teach\r\nyour people."\r\n\r\nShe sat down cross-legged on the grass. Montcalm averted his eyes, like\r\nthe gentleman he was.\r\n\r\n"You see," said Liz, "the people of your world are on the verge of going\r\nto space and joining the community of worlds. It\'s only natural the rest\r\nof us should wish to help you. We have a good many things to give you,\r\nto help you control the elements and natural conditions of your world.\r\nThe weather, for example ..."\r\n\r\nSuddenly, out of nowhere, a small cloud appeared above them and spread,\r\nblocking out the early sun. It began to rain, hard.\r\n\r\nThe rain stopped as suddenly as it had begun and the cloud dissipated.\r\nMontcalm stood shivering in his soaked pajamas and Liz got to her feet,\r\nher skin glistening with moisture.\r\n\r\n"You have a problem raising food for your population in some areas," she\r\nsaid....\r\n\r\nA small haw-apple tree near them suddenly began to grow at an amazing\r\nrate of speed. It doubled its size in three minutes, put forth fruit\r\nand dropped it to the ground.\r\n\r\n"These are only a few of the things I\'ll give to your planet," she said.\r\n\r\nAt her words, they were back in the bedroom. This time she had been\r\nthoughtful. Montcalm was still clad in wet pajamas.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what sort of hypnosis this is," he began aggressively,\r\n"but you can\'t fool me, young lady, into believing ..."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMillie came into the room. She had donned a robe over her nightgown.\r\n\r\n"Richard, where have you been with this woman?" she demanded.\r\n\r\n"Why, my dear ..."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve been roaming around the house somewhere with her. I came in here\r\na moment ago and you were gone. Now, Richard, I want you to do something\r\nabout her and stop fooling around. I can\'t keep the children in their\r\nroom all day."\r\n\r\nIt hadn\'t been hypnosis then! Liz was for real. A vision rose before\r\nMontcalm of mankind given wonders, powers, benefits representing\r\nadvances of thousands of years. The world could become a paradise with\r\nthe things she offered to teach.\r\n\r\n"Millie, this woman _is_ from another planet!" he exclaimed excitedly,\r\nand turned to Liz. "Why did you choose me to contact on Earth?"\r\n\r\n"Why, I happened to land near your house," she answered. "I know how\r\nyour primitive social organization is set up, but isn\'t one human being\r\njust as good as another to lead me to the proper authorities?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said joyfully, visualizing black headlines and his picture in\r\nthe papers.\r\n\r\nMillie stood to one side, puzzled and grim at once. Montcalm picked up\r\nthe house dress he had taken from the closet earlier.\r\n\r\n"Now, Miss," he said, "if you\'ll just put this on, I\'ll take you to the\r\nmayor and he can get in touch with Washington at once."\r\n\r\n"I told you," said Liz, "I don\'t want to adopt your custom of wearing\r\nclothing."\r\n\r\n"But you can\'t go out in public like that!" said the dismayed Montcalm.\r\n"If you\'re going to move among Earth people, you must dress as we do."\r\n\r\n"My people wouldn\'t demand that Earth people disrobe to associate with\r\nus," she countered reasonably.\r\n\r\nMillie had had enough. She went into action.\r\n\r\n"You can argue with this hussy all you like, Richard, but I\'m going to\r\ncall the police," she said, and left the room with determination in her\r\neye.\r\n\r\nThe next fifteen minutes were agonizing for Montcalm as he tried\r\nfutilely to get Liz to dress like a decent person. He was torn between\r\nrealization of what the things she offered would mean to the world and\r\nhis own sense of the fitness of things. His children, the children of\r\nTraskmore, the children of the world ... what would be the effect on\r\ntheir tender morals to realize that a sane adult was willing to walk\r\naround in brazen nakedness?\r\n\r\nThere was a pounding on the front door, and the voice of Millie inviting\r\nthe law into the house.\r\n\r\n"Now I\'m afraid you\'re due to go to jail," said Montcalm mournfully.\r\n"But when they get some clothes on you, I\'ll try to explain it and get\r\nyou an audience with the mayor."\r\n\r\nTwo blue-clad policemen entered the room.\r\n\r\nOne policeman took the house dress from Montcalm\'s lax fingers and\r\ntossed it over Liz\' head without further ado.\r\n\r\nLiz did not struggle. She looked at Montcalm with a quizzical\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry," she said. "My people made a mistake. If you Earth people\r\naren\'t tolerant enough to accept a difference in customs of dress, I\'m\r\nafraid you\'re too immature.

"\r\n\r\nWith that, she was gone like a puff of air. The astonished policemen\r\nheld an empty dress.\r\n\r\nMontcalm didn\'t see the flying saucer that whizzed over Traskmore that\r\nmorning and disappeared into the sky, but he didn\'t doubt the reports.\r\nHe debated with himself for a long time whether he had taken the right\r\nattitude, but decided he had.\r\n\r\nAfter all, there were the children to consider.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Science Fiction Stories_\r\n    September 1958.

No power."\r\nEndicott beat his old blue-veined hands together.\r\n\r\nAllison\'s frost-numbed fingers picked at the straps on his reclining\r\ngeeseat, and he stepped to the light metal deck. He shivered and\r\npunched the button on the control board again. He was seized by a spasm\r\nof uncontrollable shaking. "No power means--no heat!" Panic crept into\r\nhis voice.\r\n\r\nEndicott said nothing but looked at the tier upon tier of buttons,\r\nfunctionless now.\r\n\r\nAllison looked at the board, too, his narrow shoulders hunched.\r\n"They\'ve never failed before," he muttered through chattering teeth.\r\n\r\n"What?" Endicott seemed bemused.\r\n\r\n"The buttons. Punch \'em, and you always get what you want--except now!"\r\n\r\n"Now, now," Endicott said soothingly. "Panic isn\'t going to help us\r\nany. All we have to do is sit tight--and wait. They\'ll send a relief\r\nship out--"\r\n\r\n"When?"\r\n\r\n"In the morning. Morning, sure. They had us on the \'viewer, don\'t\r\nforget. They\'ll know exactly where to look."\r\n\r\n"They won\'t be able to locate us in this white stuff."\r\n\r\n"I tell you they know precisely where we are. And anyway the scanviewer\r\nwill pick us up."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think they\'ll ever find us." Allison slumped down on his\r\ntransverse geeseat, stared wide-eyed at the drift forming slowly inside\r\nthe torn metal of the windward side of the control room. "This white\r\nstuff scares me." He shivered, then got up hastily, his boots slipping\r\nslightly on the snow-slick decking, and punched the button again. "It\'s\r\ngot to work!" 

he cried and beat on the board with his fist.\r\n\r\n"Stop that!" Endicott said sharply.\r\n\r\nThere was a crack of a slap in the control room, then silence.\r\n\r\nIn a moment Endicott said in his soothing voice, "Sorry, Allison.\r\nEverything\'ll be all right. Don\'t you worry."\r\n\r\n"If you say so, Chief." Allison stood in the center of the control\r\nroom, his arms slack by his sides.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll be all right," Endicott said. "We have food capsules--"\r\n\r\n"Sure, Chief."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll be all right, except--" Endicott peered through the rents in the\r\nhull into the storm outside. "All we have to do is sit tight," he added\r\nhastily.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll freeze tonight without heat." Allison\'s voice was still\r\nbreathless with panic.\r\n\r\n"Yeah. 

Yeah, I\'ve been thinking about that. There\'s some thing\r\n\'way down deep in my mind--something I can\'t quite get--" Endicott\r\nstill looked out at the storm-thrashed trees, a puzzled expression\r\nwrinkling his face. "Something from my childhood--I was born a long\r\ntime before you, you know, before they set up state conditioning homes\r\nfor children. Long before they set up this \'everything-from-buttons\'\r\nbusiness. Lived with my own people, I did, and I seem to remember--seem\r\nto remember--" The puzzled expression became a frown of concentration.\r\n"Or maybe it was something I read a long time ago," he mused.\r\n\r\n"Did what?" Allison perked up.\r\n\r\n"Read. 

You wouldn\'t know what that was. Everything comes from buttons\r\nnow, entertainment, food, light, heat--everything.... No, it was from\r\nmy childhood, I\'m sure. I remember my people used to take me out in\r\nthe country--" Endicott mused on while a cloak of snow grew on the\r\nshoulders of his jacket, and the light began to fade.\r\n\r\n"Out in the country? What for? 

Nobody goes out there." Allison\'s eyes\r\ngleamed slightly in the growing dusk.\r\n\r\n"--for picnics. And--" Endicott\'s eyes brightened, and one hand\r\nclenched.\r\n\r\n"For what?" Allison\'s head thrust forward.\r\n\r\n"What?" Endicott snapped, irritated at having his train of thought\r\nbroken.\r\n\r\n"What did your people take you in the country for?"\r\n\r\n"A picnic.... Yes, yes, that\'s it! I remember now!" Endicott\'s words\r\npoured out.\r\n\r\n"You know it is forbidden to think of the old days."\r\n\r\n"Shut up! 

Let me think. You want heat, don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s forbidden to think of the old days," Allison repeated stubbornly.\r\n"You\'ll get heat when I report this--in a different way."\r\n\r\n"Shut up! 

Look, you want to keep from freezing tonight?" Endicott\r\nglared. 

"All right. Come with me and do as I say." Without a backward\r\nglance Endicott crossed the slippery deck and entered the passageway.\r\nAt the midship cargo natch he stopped.\r\n\r\n"How are you going to open it without power?" Allison\'s breath-plume\r\nshot over Endicott\'s shoulder. "It\'s locked and unlocked by a button on\r\nthe control board. Remember Chief?"\r\n\r\n"Stop gloating, Allison. This is for your benefit as well as mine.\r\nThere\'s an escape hatch in the control room."\r\n\r\n"That\'s controlled by power, too."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but in these older models the hatch also has a manual control, as\r\nI remember." Endicott moved off toward the control room.\r\n\r\nAllison hesitated, then followed, and joined Endicott as he began to\r\nsearch the control board. Endicott found the emergency lever for the\r\nescape hatch and tugged on it, turning his head to watch the hatch\r\nin the side of the hull, back of his seat. The hatch, big enough for\r\none man to pass through at a time, popped, crackling with frost, and\r\nstirred slightly.\r\n\r\n"Now, Allison, my boy, let\'s put our shoulders to it." Endicott was in\r\nhigh spirits again.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the hatch swung open, Endicott put his head and shoulders\r\nthrough the opening, squinting his eyes against the icy snow which\r\nswirled past him. He grabbed a handhold on the outside of the hull and\r\npulled his legs through, and dropped into the snow alongside the ship.\r\n\r\nAllison\'s head and shoulders appeared in the opening, and in a moment\r\nhe was beside Endicott. "Now what?" Allison yelled above the wind.\r\n\r\nEndicott looked toward the clearing in which they had landed, then\r\nturned to face the trees around the disabled ship. He waded through the\r\nsnow to the nearest one and reflectively took hold of a dry branch over\r\nhis head, tugged it several times as though judging its resiliency,\r\nbefore snapping it off.\r\n\r\n"Now, Allison, you see what I did? Well, you do the same, only gather\r\nan armload of branches. When you have them, bring them to me at the\r\nship. 

And keep on gathering them until I tell you to stop."\r\n\r\nAllison stood still in the deep snow, peering suspiciously at Endicott\r\nthrough the snow-swirl. "Is this something from the old--?"\r\n\r\n"Never mind that now, Allison," Endicott said patiently. "Let\'s not\r\nworry about all that twaddle. You want to be warm, don\'t you? So, just\r\ndo as I say."\r\n\r\nAllison\'s eyebrows shot up and lowered instantly, and his face set in\r\nstubborn planes. "If this is from the old days I\'m not sure I want any\r\npart of it." He looked furtively over his shoulders at the gloomy woods.\r\n\r\n"There are no Conditioning Committees here, Allison," Endicott said\r\ntestily. "Get on with it."\r\n\r\nAllison took a few reluctant steps toward the nearest tree. Endicott\r\nstarted back to the ship with his branch, looking back over his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n"No, no, Allison. See those green needles? It won\'t do at all.\r\nDry branches, Allison, _dry_ branches." The whipping wind carried\r\nEndicott\'s words over the few yards.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t see how these--branches?--are going to keep us warm. It seems\r\nlike a lot of useless trouble getting them," Allison said sulkily,\r\nsuspicion and fear unabated.\r\n\r\nEndicott didn\'t answer. Instead, he went to the side of the ship away\r\nfrom the wind and began tramping the snow down into a flat, hard\r\nfloor. He broke his branch into short lengths over his knee, then, in\r\na nearly forgotten gesture, slapped at his uniform until he remembered\r\nthat he had no pockets. For a moment he stood still, his eyes roving\r\nover the side of the ship until it came to one of the jagged tears.\r\nWith a little self-congratulatory chuckle, he began scraping one of\r\nthe lengths of wood over the torn metal, catching the splinters and\r\nshavings in the palm of one hand.\r\n\r\nAllison dropped his armload of branches by the ship, waged an inner\r\nbattle between fear of the unknown and curiosity in which curiosity\r\nwon, and stood watching Endicott arrange the branches in a crib around\r\nthe neatly piled shavings. Endicott, on one knee by the crib, worked\r\nsteadily, laying the pieces of wood with care and a returning sense\r\nof sureness, with only brief pauses to flex his freezing fingers.\r\nFinally, with a smile of satisfaction on his face, Endicott got to his\r\nfeet, and the nearly forgotten gesture at the pocketless uniform was\r\nrepeated.\r\n\r\nSlowly, Endicott\'s lined face altered. He looked hastily at the\r\nwatchful Allison and hastily looked away; he looked at the completed\r\ncrib, and his tongue licked his lips; he looked along the side of the\r\ndamaged ship, and his eyes narrowed thoughtfully; finally, he looked\r\ninto the swirl of the icy snow, and he shivered. 

His hands ceased their\r\npawing, fell slowly, to hang slack by his sides. 

He was not smiling as\r\nhe turned away.\r\n\r\n"What were you looking for?" Allison asked curiously.\r\n\r\n"I just remembered something else," said Endicott, his voice was very\r\nsoft in the stillness, "we used to have something called a match to\r\nstart those picnic fires."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


When does--"\r\n\r\n"Oh! At 1900 hours," she gushed.\r\n\r\n"The ship splits in half," she added helpfully, and dimpled in that\r\nwinning way of little girls who will never grow up.\r\n\r\n"Remarkable. They tell me some sort of cable will tie us together."\r\n\r\n"Yes sir, when we are far enough out in space so there isn\'t any air\r\nfriction, Mr. Webley, the pilot, pulls a little lever and the nose\r\nflies off. He\'ll be all alone out there for forty-two days."\r\n\r\n"And only a thin cable connects our passenger section to his control\r\nsection?" He was quite familiar with the details since he had lobbied\r\nfor the initial appropriation. Her forearm had a nice warm smooth\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you understand it perfectly, sir. When we\'re a mile apart a little\r\nrocket in the side makes us spin round and round. Then I can take off\r\nthese old iron shoes." She followed his gaze to her legs and tittered.\r\n\r\nHe speculated that similar magnets must be holding down the hem of her\r\nnylon skirt.\r\n\r\n"And does this spinning about a common axis continue until we near\r\nMars?"\r\n\r\n"Yes sir, for forty-two days. Excuse me sir, I think null gravity is\r\nmaking that lady ill."\r\n\r\nAfter carefully wiping his palm on his coatsleeve he replaced his unlit\r\ncigar in his broad, gleaming face. He was in the smiling sensuality of\r\na daydream when the powder-room door clicked.\r\n\r\nHis wife was beautiful.\r\n\r\nUptilting his cigar he watched her drift down the aisle. With one\r\nscarlet-tipped finger she prevented her diaphanous skirt from floating\r\nvery high above her knees. A lovely lady. 

He champed on the cigar. It\'s\r\nnot every man whose wife is a natural blonde ex-starlet young enough to\r\nbe his daughter.\r\n\r\nBut a little discipline was in order.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Landa, I wish you had remembered to have Hykato pack my golf things."\r\n\r\n"Edwin please, this null gravity is upsetting my tummy.

"\r\n\r\n"Well, it\'s the least you could have done."\r\n\r\n"And how would we have gotten it on the ship?" her voice shrilled\r\nunexpectedly. "You embarrassed me enough as it was."\r\n\r\n"Listen, I\'m the Commissioner. No two-bit pilot is going to tell me\r\nwhat I can\'t take. The luggage limit is ridiculous!"\r\n\r\n"What are you complaining about? He let you take everything, didn\'t he?"\r\n\r\n"After you smiled at him."\r\n\r\n"I was only trying to be pleasant."\r\n\r\n"Pleasant is it? Last time you said it was to influence him to take all\r\nmy luggage."\r\n\r\n"Yeah and you got sore because you weren\'t a big enough shot to swing\r\nthe deal alone," her voice rasped through its lady-like veneer.\r\n\r\n"That\'s a lie. Furthermore I don\'t want to catch you smiling at him\r\nagain."\r\n\r\n"I give up," she exclaimed and reached for a telemag.\r\n\r\nBut he wouldn\'t drop it there. "I didn\'t like that fellow\'s looks.\r\nPads in his shoulders, little waxed mustache. Who does he think he is,\r\nCaptain Future?

"\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t be funny. Just think what he thinks of you after what you\r\nsaid to him in front of all the other passengers and crew."\r\n\r\n"Taking his side now?

"\r\n\r\n"I am not." She gave a little sniff and fumbled for her handkerchief.\r\n"You\'re so mean and masterful I\'m surprised you don\'t make me go up\r\nfront and tell him what a sap he is."\r\n\r\n"He was a sap smiling at my wife all right." He uplifted his cigar with\r\na mollified grin. "He wasted a smile there. Two-bit pilot, who does he\r\nthink he is?"\r\n\r\n"He did smile at me though," she appended in a small voice.\r\n\r\nHis voice snapped out again: "And you smiled back!" He ground his unlit\r\ncigar into the ash tray. "I think you were just now trying to flatter\r\nme; I think you were trying to turn me off the track when you said\r\nyou\'d go up and tell him what a sap he is."\r\n\r\n"I was not."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t try to wiggle out of it. That\'s what you said.

"\r\n\r\n"All right, if you think I should, I will."\r\n\r\n"Well now--" He paused smiling and carefully trimmed the crushed end of\r\nhis cigar with a gold plated cigar cutter before he continued: "If you\r\ninsist, go ahead."\r\n\r\n"There\'s not much time left," she said, pointing at the neon-dialed\r\nclock above the powder-room door. Beneath it hung an orange luminescent\r\nsign: U. S. Eastern Standard Earth Time Equivalent.\r\n\r\n"1850 hours," he snorted. "Don\'t try to wiggle out on that account. 

You\r\nhave a half hour."\r\n\r\n"O.K., if you say so," she shrugged and chewed the inside of her\r\ncheek. "This isn\'t very nice."\r\n\r\n"Let\'s not get that way. You coolly slip the shaft in me enough. And\r\nstop powdering your nose."\r\n\r\nWithout another word she rose and floated down the aisle, taking little\r\ncare to suppress her skirt. Somebody whistled and the Commissioner\r\nangrily craned his thick neck around. He couldn\'t see who had done it.\r\nBut he suspected the three grinning Cadet Astronauts in the last row of\r\nseats.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _She rose and floated down the aisle, taking little care\r\nto suppress her rising, diaphanous skirt._]\r\n\r\nAs the door to the control room clanged shut, the powder-room door\r\nclicked open and the rockette tapped out on her iron shoe-soles.\r\nCommissioner Elbert rolled his eyes and smiled, but she seemed\r\npreoccupied with a smaller female with pigtails and the hiccups.\r\n\r\nGuess I\'ll have a look forward myself, he thought. Just like a woman to\r\ngo up there, wait in the hall a minute and come back.\r\n\r\nRising, he floated past the rockette toward the control room door.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t open that, sir. The ship\'s about to separate."\r\n\r\n"What? It\'s only 1855 hours."\r\n\r\n"That is Eastern Standard Time, sir. The clock at the other end of\r\nthe aisle, over the men\'s room, gives the Standard Star Time our ship\r\nschedule operates on."\r\n\r\nThose neon hands pointed at 1900.\r\n\r\nWith a strangled yell he lunged for the door, but as his hand closed\r\nabout the handle something clicked and it resisted his straining and\r\nthen his pounding fists.\r\n\r\nA buzzer sounded and a cheery masculine voice spoke over the intercom.\r\n"Hello again passengers, this is your pilot Hugh Webley wishing you a\r\npleasant crossing. Please re-enter your safticorsettes. The Bolo II\r\nwill now separate."\r\n\r\n"Intercom," the Commissioner shouted. Shoving past the slack-jawed\r\nrockette, he literally swam down the gravityless aisle to the\r\nengineering hatchway. It opened to his shouts.\r\n\r\n"Yeah?" A giant with a handlebar mustache peered up at him.\r\n\r\n"I\'m Commissioner Elbert. Call your pilot at once. I order the ship not\r\nto separate."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHastily the giant lifted the phone. Commissioner Elbert could hear the\r\nsteady buzz.\r\n\r\n"Sorry sir, Webley\'s cut us off. He does that so no one will interrupt\r\nhim while he\'s setting the auto controls.

"\r\n\r\n"Get him somehow. 

My wife\'s up there."\r\n\r\nThe giant coughed and strangled and turned his face away. "I\'ll keep\r\ntrying sir," he gasped. "But sometimes he cuts us off for days. He\r\nsleeps a lot."\r\n\r\n"Forehatch," the Commissioner shouted suddenly. "Unlock the forehatch."\r\n\r\nWearily the giant clambered up. He towered above Elbert.\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t you hear what I said," the Commissioner yelled. "Unlock the\r\ndoor to the control room."\r\n\r\n"Sorry sir, the lock\'s automatic."\r\n\r\n"Well dammit, blast it down."\r\n\r\nNoisily the giant scratched his crewcut. "Maybe I could crowbar it."\r\n\r\n"Quick, you fool."\r\n\r\n"No, I can\'t. 

I can\'t sir. The ship might separate while the hatch was\r\nopen and our own air pressure would blow us all into the vacuum. I\r\ncan\'t risk the lives of our passengers, sir."\r\n\r\n"I\'m Commissioner Elbert. Give me that crowbar."\r\n\r\nThe giant held it behind him.\r\n\r\n"That\'s an order."\r\n\r\n"Sorry sir, better reclaim your seat before the jolt." The giant\r\nsignalled with his fingers at the rockette.\r\n\r\nElbert snatched at the crowbar. As the two men grappled for it,\r\nwhirling like fighting cocks in the air, a tremendous surge hurled them\r\nthe length of the aisle. Another slammed them against the powder-room\r\ndoor. When the giant helped the bleeding Commissioner to his feet,\r\nartificial gravity held them down.\r\n\r\nEmitting motherly sounds, the rockette tried to wipe the blood from his\r\nforehead. But he shoved her aside.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll sue. I\'ll have your transport license revoked."\r\n\r\n"Please sir," the rockette squeaked, "I\'ll bring you a sedative."\r\n\r\n"Hugens will hear about this," he shouted, writhing in the engineer\'s\r\nbrawny arms. But then he sobbed: "I sent her up there. My fault, my\r\nidea, she didn\'t want to go. She was worried about the time and I told\r\nher there was plenty of time."\r\n\r\nAs he gulped the sedative he looked like a punctured balloon.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want a sedative," he shouted. But he had just swallowed it.\r\nHe sagged again. 

"My fault. I told her there was plenty of time." He\r\nrubbed his sleeve across his nose.\r\n\r\nAfter they had settled him groggily in his seat, the rockette drew the\r\nengineer aside. Her pretty little brow wrinkled.\r\n\r\n"Dan, I can\'t figure it. Why does he think it\'s his fault? Gee, when\r\nwe were in the powder-room together she asked me about why the clocks\r\ntold different times, and I explained how we figure time by positions\r\nof stars instead of the earth and sun and all that stuff. You\'d think\r\nshe\'d understood. 

She talked bright enough."\r\n\r\nThe giant squeezed her arm affectionately. Lucky Webley, sap Commish,\r\nbright dame. Forty-two days and an alibi.\r\n\r\nHe chuckled and walked his fingers up her arm.\r\n\r\n"Carol, you can\'t ever tell. All dames don\'t have the same amount of\r\nbrightness you do."\r\n\r\nShe giggled and shivered a little at his hand. "We learned all about\r\ntime in rockette school."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


"\r\n             He smiled grimly. Yes, he knew what to do....\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n                      Planet Stories Winter 1946.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fifth Sector Commander was known as a rigid man, that was true, and\r\nyet no one could say exactly how rigid.\r\n\r\nHis office, aboard the _Polaris_, was a rather grim place. All command\r\noffices were, essentially, being limited pretty much to regulation\r\nfurnishings, but rare was the Commander who did not manage to plant\r\nsome of his personality there. It was perhaps characteristic of\r\nCommander Gray that there was only one item in his office which could\r\nbe said to reveal anything about him.\r\n\r\nHe sat now behind the cubical steel desk and looked down at the glowing\r\nscreen of the television set. The face in it was not at ease. Far from\r\nit.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, John Brullar, the Commissioner over Gray, was a\r\nself-important, unconsciously comical person. Now he looked neither\r\ncomical nor important. He just looked very, very frightened.\r\n\r\nHe licked his trembling lips and said, in a voice hoarse with fear,\r\n"Of _course_ there is something you can do, Commander! After all,"\r\nhe brightened faintly, "there are important people on the _Stella_.\r\nImportant people." He emphasized "important."\r\n\r\n"I am aware of that, Commissioner Brullar," said the Commander. "Yet,\r\nwhat can I do?"\r\n\r\n"You have authority!" sputtered Brullar. "And you know what you can\r\n_do_! Get through to Interstellar Command on Sirius VII and tell them\r\njust exactly what these Beolins are up to!" He glared, a fat man in\r\nmortal fear for his life. "And you can do it quickly, Commander!\r\nQuickly, do you understand?"\r\n\r\n"I understand," the Commander said.\r\n\r\n"Good." Brullar started to speak again, gulped, hesitated, and finally\r\nrepeated, "Good." He switched off.\r\n\r\nThe Commander gazed reflectively down the catwalk, through the ship,\r\nat the faint glimmer of green outside of an open lock. There was a\r\nturbulence deep in his steel-colored eyes. He tapped a small stud with\r\na slim, tapering forefinger.\r\n\r\nKina Staun came in.\r\n\r\nKina wasn\'t all Solarian. He had enough Sol blood in him to make him\r\none in almost every respect, but there were differences, if you looked\r\nclosely. He was the Commander\'s personal aide. 

There was actually\r\nmore than that between them. The tremendousness of all the Commander\r\ngoverned--and which Kina helped him run--made for a rather involved\r\nrelationship.\r\n\r\nWhen people saw the Commander, they looked for Kina Staun. The two\r\nhad not been a hundred yards apart since they had first met as\r\nnewly-appointed official and aide. It was said that Kina knew every\r\nbit as much about the Fifth Sector and the Commander\'s work as the\r\nCommander knew himself.\r\n\r\nFor that reason, if Kina ever left his post, he would certainly die\r\nwithin an hour.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Commander said, "Kina, call Hauns." The Secretary showed no\r\nsurprise, but somehow managed to give that impression.\r\n\r\n"The city of Hauns, capitol of Beolin III, the ruling planet of the\r\nBeolin system?" he asked very respectfully.\r\n\r\n"Yes. 

I want to talk to their Commissioner-in-Chief. And also find the\r\npresent location of the _Stella_."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," said Kina.\r\n\r\nHe came back within ten seconds. "The _Stella_," he said, "is now at\r\n3rd Quadrant 3521 NA, W-88236. Speed, one light-year per hour. Heading,\r\n338 Degrees NA of nearest sun, Beolin. And I have Beolin Command for\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nThe Commander touched a switch and the screen flicked on again. "Thank\r\nyou, Kina," he said.\r\n\r\nThe face in the screen was definitely not human. Its structure, and\r\neven more, its expression was alien. It was distinctly unpleasant.\r\n\r\nIt belonged to Krraula, who was Commander-in-Chief, and the foremost\r\nmurderer of the Beolin System. He smiled, a smile that was not a smile.\r\nHe said, "Ah, Commander." And he saluted, sneering slightly.\r\n\r\nThe Commander said, "Greetings, Krraula. I would like to inquire the\r\nreason for your fleet being in its present position."\r\n\r\nKrraula smiled again. "The fleet, Commander? Merely maneuvers," he said\r\nslyly. 

"Why do you ask?"\r\n\r\n"There is a liner transiting through the outer fringes of your\r\nterritory in--" he looked at a paper Kina had slipped before him\r\n"--about four hours. I would appreciate it if your fleet is withdrawn\r\nin time. It would not go well, Krraula, if an ... accident ... were to\r\nhappen to this liner of which I speak. I think you understand."\r\n\r\nHe gave Krraula no time to answer, but switched off. He sat back, and\r\nlooked aimlessly at Kina.\r\n\r\n"Kina," he said, after a few moments of thought.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Commander."\r\n\r\n"Do you get the framework of this problem?"\r\n\r\n"I do, sir," answered the aide.\r\n\r\n"Good. Let me hear it."\r\n\r\n"The question is one of Command," said Kina Staun quietly. "Out here in\r\nthe stars, power--the authority to command--goes not to men\'s heads but\r\nto their souls. Krraula of Beolin is an example, and, in a different\r\nway--"\r\n\r\n"Myself?"\r\n\r\n"No, Commander Brullar. He is the brass-hat type, while Krraula is\r\nsimply a tyrannical madman."\r\n\r\n"So far, you\'re right. 

But what of _this_ particular problem?

"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," the aide said. "Krraula, and the Beolin rulers, have power\r\nin and about their system to the extent that their depredations go\r\nunchallenged there. And an apathetic Interstellar Command--"\r\n\r\n"Does not act," finished the Commander. "You are entirely correct,\r\nKina." He touched studs on the desk and reports slid through the viewer\r\non the wall. He said quietly, "We have lost a score of ships--ships\r\nthat we are sure the Beolins could tell us about. And yet the Command\r\ndoes not act." He looked reflectively at the slim, impassive man, and\r\nthen spoke swiftly.\r\n\r\n"Kina, I want you to get me two more connections ... Sirius VII, and\r\nthe Command Cruiser nearest to Beolin. Hurry! 

The cruiser first."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA minute or so later, Kina slipped a sheet of paper onto the desk, and\r\ntouched a switch. The screen glittered into life, showing the face of\r\na man who wore a captain\'s shoulder bars. Glancing at the paper, which\r\ngave the name of the officer and the ship, the Commander said, "Captain\r\nStang, how far are you from Beolin?"\r\n\r\n"Roughly twenty light years, sir," was the immediate answer.\r\n\r\n"Do you think that you can make a speed of--say--five light-years per\r\nhour, or perhaps more?"\r\n\r\nThe captain frowned slightly. 

"I\'m not sure, Commander. Perhaps we can."\r\n\r\n"Good! Stand by, at your present position in space." Gray switched off.\r\n\r\nKina spoke softly at his side. "That one cruiser, Commander, is more\r\nthan a match for the entire Beolin fleet." He paused. "Here is your\r\ncall to Sirius Headquarters, sir."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "That one cruiser, Commander, is more than a match for\r\nthe entire Beolin fleet."]\r\n\r\nThe Commander turned back to the screen. "Over-Commissioner Branu, are\r\nyou aware of the present stage of relations with Beolin?"\r\n\r\nThe Over-Commissioner frowned at him. "Certainly! Why are you asking,\r\nCommander?" There was an imperious sharpness in his voice.\r\n\r\n"What are they?"\r\n\r\nBranu hesitated, said, "Relations are somewhat strained at present, of\r\ncourse, but not seriously. I--"\r\n\r\n"Suppose proof was given that Beolin was back of the recent\r\ndisappearances of spacecraft?"\r\n\r\n"My dear Commander Gray! You--you must not say that! Such an intimation\r\nmight _easily_ cost you your post! Why--"\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner cut him off.\r\n\r\n"You see, Commander," said Kina, "the Command simply cannot think of\r\nsuch a thing."\r\n\r\n"Yes ... but they could be made--forced--to think of it."\r\n\r\n"There is only one way to do _that_," said Kina. "Only one way."\r\n\r\n"Yes." Commander Gray fell silent for a minute, and then said quietly,\r\n"Kina."\r\n\r\n"I am listening, sir."\r\n\r\n"The hands of one man," said the Commander, "were never meant to hold\r\npersonal power such as this. We can do only the best we can ... and it\r\nwill never be perfect. We must be prepared to--" he hesitated slightly\r\nbefore going on "--to set aside all personal things, and substitute the\r\nstars for them. Because only in that way can we approach perfection."\r\n\r\nKina was silent and attentive, but his eyes flickered for a second\r\nacross the one personal item in the office.\r\n\r\n"I am not a god, Kina. And yet I must be. Because there are men--such\r\nas Krraula--who think they are." He fell silent.\r\n\r\nThen he said, "A god _must_ have power of life ... and death."\r\n\r\nThe screen was on again and, once more, it was Commissioner Brullar. He\r\nwas almost frantic.\r\n\r\n"Commander Gray! Have you acted yet? 

The captain says that we are being\r\nscreened out. Only this special set can get through--and only to you!"\r\nHe gulped, mopping at his forehead. "Commander, I have my entire family\r\naboard this ship! I--I know that you...." His voice faltered for an\r\ninstant. "Can\'t _you_ get through to the Command?

"\r\n\r\nThen, nervously, without waiting for a reply, he plunged on. "The\r\nCaptain of the _Stella_ says he believes there is an Interstellar\r\nCommand cruiser within four hours or so. Can\'t you get it here? It\r\ncould escort us through the edge of the Beolin system in safety!\r\nCommander Gray, I in--"\r\n\r\nThe Commander cut Brullar off.\r\n\r\n"Kina," he asked, "what do you think the effect of a Beolin massacre\r\nwould be on the Command?"\r\n\r\n"Roughly estimating, Commander, considerably more than the effect of an\r\nunleashed power beam on inert matter."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the Commander. 

"Yes. Kina, at least ten thousand human\r\nlives have been lost on ships that I _know_ have been captured by the\r\nBeolins. Unless the Command takes action--now--there will never be a\r\ncheck on Krraula and his successors. And only a shocking catastrophe\r\nwould stir up the Sirius Command Headquarter. A certain kind of\r\ncatastrophe."\r\n\r\n"The sacrifice justifies itself," said Kina Staun. "The moral laws, the\r\nvery framework of civilization itself, is now of a shape incredible to\r\nthe person of two or three hundred years ago."\r\n\r\n"My orders, then, should be...?"\r\n\r\nKina stood up, stiffly. "It would be presumptuous of me, Commander."\r\n\r\nThe silence did not last very long.\r\n\r\nAt last the Commander said, "Kina, order Captain Stang to resume\r\nhis usual patrol activities. Arrange to follow the _Stella_ with a\r\nlong-range recording beam. Prepare for the Interstellar Command\'s\r\norder ... to proceed with a punitive expedition against the Beolin\r\nsystem." He looked long down the catwalk, and his fingers slowly closed\r\nabout the one personal touch to his office.\r\n\r\nHis voice was very low. 

"No more messages are to be received from the\r\n_Stella_."\r\n\r\nAnd he opened his hand.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLater, after the Commander had gone down the catwalk to walk about for\r\na while on the soft, Earthlike greenness of this world\'s vegetation,\r\nKina bent to pick up that which had fallen to the floor.\r\n\r\nIt was a color photograph, and the cold plastic sheen of the film\r\nsomehow managed to convey the impression of the blonde, young woman\'s\r\nsoft, warm loveliness.\r\n\r\nIt was inscribed, "_With all my love, John. Myra._" Kina had often seen\r\nCommissioner Brullar\'s daughter.\r\n\r\nHe dropped the photograph in to a disposal chute, and turned to some\r\npapers that had to be filed.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


As\r\na result of them the permanent population includes smugglers and\r\nblack-marketeers, fugitives from justice and international con men,\r\nespionage and counter-espionage agents, homosexuals, nymphomaniacs,\r\nalcoholics, drug addicts, displaced persons, ex-royalty, and subversives\r\nof every flavor. Local law limits the activities of few of these.\r\n\r\nLike I said, it\'s quite a town.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI looked up from my _Herald Tribune_ and said, "Hello, Paul. Anything\r\nnew cooking?"\r\n\r\nHe sank into the chair opposite me and looked around for the waiter. The\r\ntables were all crowded and since mine was a face he recognized, he\r\nassumed he was welcome to intrude. It was more or less standard\r\nprocedure at the Cafe de Paris. It wasn\'t a place to go if you wanted to\r\nbe alone.\r\n\r\nPaul said, "How are you, Rupert? Haven\'t seen you for donkey\'s years."\r\n\r\nThe waiter came along and Paul ordered a glass of beer. Paul was an\r\neasy-going, sallow-faced little man. I vaguely remembered somebody\r\nsaying he was from Liverpool and in exports.\r\n\r\n"What\'s in the newspaper?" he said, disinterestedly.\r\n\r\n"Pogo and Albert are going to fight a duel," I told him, "and Lil Abner\r\nis becoming a rock\'n\'roll singer."\r\n\r\nHe grunted.\r\n\r\n"Oh," I said, "the intellectual type." 

I scanned the front page. "The\r\nRusskies have put up another manned satellite."\r\n\r\n"They have, eh? How big?"\r\n\r\n"Several times bigger than anything we Americans have."\r\n\r\nThe beer came and looked good, so I ordered a glass too.\r\n\r\nPaul said, "What ever happened to those poxy flying saucers?"\r\n\r\n"What flying saucers?"\r\n\r\nA French girl went by with a poodle so finely clipped as to look as\r\nthough it\'d been shaven. The girl was in the latest from Paris. Every\r\npore in place. We both looked after her.\r\n\r\n"You know, what everybody was seeing a few years ago. It\'s too bad one\r\nof these bloody manned satellites wasn\'t up then. Maybe they would\'ve\r\nseen one."\r\n\r\n"That\'s an idea," I said.\r\n\r\nWe didn\'t say anything else for a while and I began to wonder if I could\r\ngo back to my paper without rubbing him the wrong way. I didn\'t know\r\nPaul very well, but, for that matter, it\'s comparatively seldom you ever\r\nget to know anybody very well in Tangier. Largely, cards are played\r\nclose to the chest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy beer came and a plate of tapas for us both. Tapas at the Cafe de\r\nParis are apt to be potato salad, a few anchovies, olives, and possibly\r\nsome cheese. Free lunch, they used to call it in the States.\r\n\r\nJust to say something, I said, "Where do you think they came from?" And\r\nwhen he looked blank, I added, "The Flying Saucers."\r\n\r\nHe grinned. "From Mars or Venus, or someplace."\r\n\r\n"Ummmm," I said. "Too bad none of them ever crashed, or landed on the\r\nYale football field and said _Take me to your cheerleader_, or\r\nsomething."\r\n\r\nPaul yawned and said, "That was always the trouble with those crackpot\r\nblokes\' explanations of them. If they were aliens from space, then why\r\nnot show themselves?"\r\n\r\nI ate one of the potato chips. It\'d been cooked in rancid olive oil.\r\n\r\nI said, "Oh, there are various answers to that one. We could probably\r\nsit around here and think of two or three that made sense.

"\r\n\r\nPaul was mildly interested. "Like what?"\r\n\r\n"Well, hell, suppose for instance there\'s this big Galactic League of\r\ncivilized planets. But it\'s restricted, see. You\'re not eligible for\r\nmembership until you, well, say until you\'ve developed space flight.\r\nThen you\'re invited into the club. Meanwhile, they send secret missions\r\ndown from time to time to keep an eye on your progress."\r\n\r\nPaul grinned at me. 

"I see you read the same poxy stuff I do."\r\n\r\nA Moorish girl went by dressed in a neatly tailored gray jellaba,\r\nEuropean style high-heeled shoes, and a pinkish silk veil so transparent\r\nthat you could see she wore lipstick. Very provocative, dark eyes can be\r\nover a veil. We both looked after her.\r\n\r\nI said, "Or, here\'s another one. Suppose you have a very advanced\r\ncivilization on, say, Mars."\r\n\r\n"Not Mars. No air, and too bloody dry to support life."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t interrupt, please," I said with mock severity. "This is a very\r\nold civilization and as the planet began to lose its water and air, it\r\nwithdrew underground. Uses hydroponics and so forth, husbands its water\r\nand air. Isn\'t that what we\'d do, in a few million years, if Earth lost\r\nits water and air?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose so," he said. 

"Anyway, what about them?"\r\n\r\n"Well, they observe how man is going through a scientific boom, an\r\nindustrial boom, a population boom. A boom, period. Any day now he\'s\r\ngoing to have practical space ships. Meanwhile, he\'s also got the H-Bomb\r\nand the way he beats the drums on both sides of the Curtain, he\'s not\r\nagainst using it, if he could get away with it."\r\n\r\nPaul said, "I got it. So they\'re scared and are keeping an eye on us.\r\nThat\'s an old one. I\'ve read that a dozen times, dished up different."\r\n\r\nI shifted my shoulders. "Well, it\'s one possibility."\r\n\r\n"I got a better one. How\'s this. 

There\'s this alien life form that\'s way\r\nahead of us. Their civilization is so old that they don\'t have any\r\nrecords of when it began and how it was in the early days. They\'ve gone\r\nbeyond things like wars and depressions and revolutions, and greed for\r\npower or any of these things giving us a bad time here on Earth. They\'re\r\nall like scholars, get it? And some of them are pretty jolly well taken\r\nby Earth, especially the way we are right now, with all the problems,\r\nget it? 

Things developing so fast we don\'t know where we\'re going or how\r\nwe\'re going to get there."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI finished my beer and clapped my hands for Mouley. "How do you mean,\r\n_where we\'re going_?"\r\n\r\n"Well, take half the countries in the world today. They\'re trying to\r\nindustrialize, modernize, catch up with the advanced countries. Look at\r\nEgypt, and Israel, and India and China, and Yugoslavia and Brazil, and\r\nall the rest. Trying to drag themselves up to the level of the advanced\r\ncountries, and all using different methods of doing it. But look at the\r\nso-called advanced countries. Up to their bottoms in problems. Juvenile\r\ndelinquents, climbing crime and suicide rates, the loony-bins full of\r\nthe balmy, unemployed, threat of war, spending all their money on\r\narmaments instead of things like schools. All the bloody mess of it.\r\nWhy, a man from Mars would be fascinated, like."\r\n\r\nMouley came shuffling up in his babouche slippers and we both ordered\r\nanother schooner of beer.\r\n\r\nPaul said seriously, "You know, there\'s only one big snag in this sort\r\nof talk. I\'ve sorted the whole thing out before, and you always come up\r\nagainst this brick wall. Where are they, these observers, or scholars,\r\nor spies or whatever they are? Sooner or later we\'d nab one of them.\r\nYou know, Scotland Yard, or the F.B.I., or Russia\'s secret police, or\r\nthe French S\xc3\xbbret\xc3\xa9, or Interpol. This world is so deep in police,\r\ncounter-espionage outfits and security agents that an alien would slip\r\nup in time, no matter how much he\'d been trained. Sooner or later, he\'d\r\nslip up, and they\'d nab him.

"\r\n\r\nI shook my head. 

"Not necessarily. The first time I ever considered this\r\npossibility, it seemed to me that such an alien would base himself in\r\nLondon or New York. Somewhere where he could use the libraries for\r\nresearch, get the daily newspapers and the magazines. Be right in the\r\ncenter of things. 

But now I don\'t think so. I think he\'d be right here\r\nin Tangier."\r\n\r\n"Why Tangier?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s the one town in the world where anything goes. Nobody gives a damn\r\nabout you or your affairs. For instance, I\'ve known you a year or more\r\nnow, and I haven\'t the slightest idea of how you make your living."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right," Paul admitted. "In this town you seldom even ask a man\r\nwhere\'s he\'s from. He can be British, a White Russian, a Basque or a\r\nSikh and nobody could care less. Where are _you_ from, Rupert?"\r\n\r\n"California," I told him.\r\n\r\n"No, you\'re not," he grinned.\r\n\r\nI was taken aback. "What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"I felt your mind probe back a few minutes ago when I was talking about\r\nScotland Yard or the F.B.I. possibly flushing an alien. Telepathy is a\r\nsense not trained by the humanoids. If they had it, your job--and\r\nmine--would be considerably more difficult. Let\'s face it, in spite of\r\nthese human bodies we\'re disguised in, neither of us is humanoid. Where\r\nare you really from, Rupert?"\r\n\r\n"Aldebaran," I said. 

"How about you?"\r\n\r\n"Deneb," he told me, shaking.\r\n\r\nWe had a laugh and ordered another beer.\r\n\r\n"What\'re you doing here on Earth?" I asked him.\r\n\r\n"Researching for one of our meat trusts. We\'re protein eaters. Humanoid\r\nflesh is considered quite a delicacy. How about you?"\r\n\r\n"Scouting the place for thrill tourists. My job is to go around to these\r\nbackward cultures and help stir up inter-tribal, or international,\r\nconflicts--all according to how advanced they are.

]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt happened just before he reached the zero point, the no-man's land\r\nin space where the attenuated gravity fields of two planets meet and\r\ncancel out.\r\n\r\nMaynard was dividing his attention equally between the transparent\r\nbubble that housed the Meinz pendulum and the two ports, forward\r\nand aft, that broke the steel panelling of the control cubicle. He\r\nlistened critically to the measured clicking of the Geiger counters\r\nand the quiet sibilance of the air purifiers, and in spite of his\r\nweightlessness and his total loss of equilibrium he was quite calm.\r\n\r\nBut deep inside him, under his trained calmness, Maynard felt a\r\nsteadily growing triumph, a swelling exultation that was a thing quite\r\napart from scientific pride. The feeling that he was a pioneer, an\r\nadvance guard for a conquering people, elated him and multiplied the\r\neagerness in him when he turned his eyes to the forward port where\r\nMars hung, full and ruddy, a spotted enigmatic disc of promise.\r\n\r\nEarth hung in the after port behind and below him, a soft emerald\r\ncrescent in its first thin quarter. A warm green sickle that was home,\r\na hustling verdant young world impatient to push its way across black\r\nempty space and satisfy its lusty curiosity about its cosmic neighbors.\r\n\r\nHe was at the end of his second day out, and he had covered roughly\r\nhalf of the distance he must travel. The atomic jets had cut off long\r\nago, at escape velocity, and would not come on again until they were\r\nneeded to slow his approach. The midpoint lay just ahead; in a matter\r\nof minutes now he would leave Earth's waning field and fall free into\r\nthe grasp of the red planet.\r\n\r\nHe was watching the cobalt ball of the Meinz pendulum quiver on its\r\nthin quartz thread with the first fluttering release of Earth's gravity\r\nwhen the fear came.\r\n\r\nTerror struck him suddenly, galvanically, blanking out all reason and\r\nall sensation. The control cubicle whirled giddily before his eyes, and\r\nthe abysmal panic that gripped his mind was a monstrous thing boiling\r\nup out of unguessed subconscious depths. It froze him, breathing, like\r\na man paralyzed under an overwhelming electric shock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Then terror struck!_]\r\n\r\nIt was not fear of death. It was not even his own fear.\r\n\r\nIt was the blind panic of Something inside him whose existence he\r\nhad never remotely suspected, Something that shrieked soundlessly in\r\nsenseless maniac terror and fought to tear Itself free of him.\r\n\r\nHe was torn by the struggle for an interminable instant, and then it\r\nwas over. He felt it writhe loose from the encumbrance of his mind,\r\nlike a madman writhing out of a strait-jacket, and then It was falling\r\nback toward Earth, away from him. He could sense It plainly, once It\r\nwas outside him--a malevolent, intangible Thing that fell back swiftly\r\ntoward the emerald crescent of Earth.\r\n\r\nHe sat for a moment dazed while breath came back into his lungs and the\r\nsteel-panelled cubicle grew steady again before his starting eyes.\r\nAnd, when It had gone in the distance and he could no longer feel\r\nthe frenzy of Its terror, he felt the swift unbounded freedom that a\r\nspirited horse feels when it has, unexpectedly, lost its rider.\r\n\r\nHe was still Robert Maynard, but with a difference.\r\n\r\n_He was free._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe feeling of utter freedom staggered him. For the first time in his\r\nlife he possessed himself entirely, without doubt or reservation, a\r\ncomplete and serene entity. He could feel his consciousness still\r\nexpanding, reaching into every hidden corner of his mind and taking\r\ncontrol of functions he had not dreamed of before.\r\n\r\nAn analogy occurred to him in perfect exactness of detail: he was like\r\na man waking from a vague world of sleep to find that what he had\r\nthought a single small room was in reality a spacious house. There\r\nwere other rooms than the cramped chamber he had lived in all his\r\nlife--rooms that had been tenanted a moment before by Something else,\r\nbut which lay open and ready for his own use now that their Tenant was\r\ngone. A moment before his ego had occupied a meager one-twelfth of his\r\nbrain; with Its departure the whole of his mind was his.\r\n\r\nAs suddenly as that he knew what had happened to him and why, and his\r\nincredibly-multiplied intelligence arranged the details of it precisely\r\nfor his consideration.\r\n\r\nHe had been host to a parasitic intelligence, without knowing it, all\r\nhis life. He had moved at Its dictates, following his own will only\r\nwhen It slept or tired or was distracted, never succeeding fully in any\r\nendeavor of his own because It was in control and must be obeyed. He\r\nknew when he had explored the vacated premises of his newly freed mind\r\nthat It was only one of many, that all earthmen had Tenants like It,\r\nintangible parasitic entities subsisting upon and controlling the human\r\nlife force.\r\n\r\nHe thought: _No wonder we have wars on Earth! We have no common ground\r\nfor agreement because we are under Their compulsion. 

They know our\r\ninherent abilities and keep us at each others' throats lest we learn\r\nof and destroy them. Everything that man has accomplished has been done\r\nin spite of Them._\r\n\r\nHe looked with new eyes at the instrument panel under the forward port\r\nand was astonished at the crudity of the engines it controlled. He was\r\nprimarily an astrophysicist, and his understanding of atomic propulsion\r\nhad been negligible; now its every function was clear to him at a\r\nglance. Experimentally he drew a graph of the arc he described through\r\nspace, and knew to a minute how long it would be before the braking\r\njets slowed his speed for landing.\r\n\r\nHe raised his eyes to the forward port where the ruddy disc of Mars\r\nhung framed against the black velvet backdrop of space like a red jewel\r\nburning dully among a random display of lesser brilliants, beckoning\r\nhim on with the future's illimitable promise.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe sat quite still for a time on the padded control couch, thinking\r\nintently, testing the new powers of his mind as he might have flexed a\r\nnewly discovered limb.\r\n\r\nHis first conclusion was inescapable: his Tenant had left him because\r\nIt could not exist outside Earth's gravity. It had been forced to quit\r\nhim or perish, and Its departure had made him the first really free man.\r\n\r\nThey were not invincible. 

They were not even particularly intelligent,\r\nin spite of Their gift of parasitic control, or his own Tenant would\r\nhave known Its danger. The fact that They were gravity-bound entities\r\ngave him the first vulnerable chink in Their armor, an Achilles heel\r\nthat offered eventual salvation for men. There would be other ways to\r\nbe rid of Them, and it was his responsibility as the first free man to\r\nsee that others of his kind were freed as he had been.\r\n\r\nHe pictured the harmonious integration of an Earth peopled by free\r\nmen and saw clearly the heights men might reach unhampered by their\r\nTenants. His own possibilities, when he had summed them up, awed him in\r\ntheir extent. There were no limits to what he could do, no bounds to\r\nthe knowledge he could accumulate and use.\r\n\r\n_This is what being a man is really like. I can liberate a world. Like\r\nMoses, I can set my people free._\r\n\r\nThe thought set his face shining, suffused him with a glow of\r\nanticipated triumph. It was all so simple, now that he was free....\r\n\r\nIn a few hours he would land on Mars, and in a matter of minutes he\r\ncould set up a beam transmitter to report back to the scientific\r\nfoundation that had sent him out. He could not tell his fellows the\r\ntruth because they were still captive, and their Tenants must not\r\nbe warned; but he could invent a plausible story of easily acquired\r\nwealth on Mars that would bring other and larger commercial expeditions\r\nswarming after him. With the help of other freed men he could found a\r\nnew civilization on the red planet, develop means to carry the fight\r\nback to Earth and exterminate the Tenants utterly. It would take time,\r\nbut in the end men would be free.\r\n\r\nThe Meinz centrifuge spun slowly, and with the swing of its cobalt ball\r\nMaynard felt the shift from terrestrial to Martian gravity. He felt the\r\nfirst tiny tug of weight and the slow returning of equilibrium as his\r\nbody oriented itself to the growing pull of the new attraction.\r\n\r\nWith the return of equilibrium he suddenly realized that he was upside\r\ndown and turned to the control board for correction. The cubicle\r\nrighted itself, rotating gently until the ruddy expanding disc of Mars\r\nhung below and ahead of the forward port. The Meinz pendulum ceased to\r\noscillate, the little cobalt ball hanging stiffly at the end of its\r\ntaut quartz filament.\r\n\r\nHe was well into the Martian attraction field by now. He made a quick\r\ncalculation (which once would have taken painstaking hours) and knew\r\nthat he would release the first braking blast from his forward jets\r\nin precisely ten hours. The little ship would nose into a slowly\r\ntightening spiral, avoiding the odd-planed orbits of the two tiny moons\r\nand, within minutes of establishing his declaration track, he would be\r\nready to land.\r\n\r\nHe watched eagerly as the red disc of Mars swelled to a mottled globe,\r\nblurred already at the edges by atmospheric refraction. Down there on\r\nthe dead ground of that ancient world he would set up his equipment and\r\nflash back his triumphant message to Earth, a fabulous exultant lie\r\nthat would bring other men like him swarming to the red planet.\r\n\r\n_Free men! Supermen, really, in a new free world. Nothing impossible,\r\nthen!_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLater, he shut off the braking blast of the forward jets and felt\r\nthe soft rubber-foam padding of the couch rise gently under him as\r\ndeceleration ceased. He was well into his landing spiral, eating up the\r\npaltry thousands of miles that lay between him and the shining future.\r\n\r\nHe lay back on the couch, smiling, his mind busy with the message he\r\nwould beam back to Earth, planning already the campaign he would carry\r\nout. Years must pass before men were freed completely of their Tenants,\r\nperhaps decades, but time did not matter. It was essentially a simple\r\ntask because he and those to come after him would be free of Their\r\ncompulsion--serene unhampered supermen to whom time was nothing.\r\n\r\nIn the end they could not fail....\r\n\r\nSomething impinged sharply upon his new perception, a chill groping\r\ntentacle of questioning intelligence. The smile froze on his face;\r\nhe sat up stiffly, numbled with the unforeseen horror of what was\r\nhappening to him. The groping ceased, and the hungry Intelligence from\r\noutside poured into his mind like smoke into an empty room, smothering\r\nhis feeble attempt at resistance.\r\n\r\nHe rose and went to the forward port, staring dully down at the\r\nuprushing sandy wastes and trying to recall what glorious thing it\r\nwas that he had been thinking. Or had it been only a dream? 

Somewhere\r\nin the farthest recess of his blunted consciousness a thought formed\r\nand floated like a bubble up into his awareness; but like a bubble it\r\nburst, and its meaning was lost on him.\r\n\r\n_There were Tenants on Earth_, it said. _Why not on Mars, too?_\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n

They called it, naturally enough, The Sun--just as home\r\nwas Earth, Terra, or simply The World. And naturally enough, being the\r\nascendant animal on Earth, they called themselves human beings. They\r\nwere looking for extraterrestrial souls to save.\r\n\r\nThey had no real hope of finding humans like themselves in this\r\nwonderously diversified universe. But it wasn\'t against all probability\r\nthat, in their rumaging, there might not be a humanoid species to whom\r\nthey could reach down a helping paw; some emergent cousin with at least\r\na rudimentary symmetry from snout to tail, and hence a rudimentary soul.\r\n\r\nThe ship they chose was a compact scout, vaguely resembling the outside\r\nof an orange crate--except that they had no concept of an orange crate\r\nand, being a tesseract, it had no particular outside. It was simply an\r\nexpanding cube (and as such, quite roomy) whose "interior" was always\r\nparalleling its "exterior" (or attempting to), in accordance with all\r\nthe well-known, basic and irrefutable laws on the subject.\r\n\r\nA number of its sides occupied the same place at the same time, giving\r\na hypothetical spectator the illusion of looking down merging sets of\r\nrailway tracks. This, in fact, was its precise method of locomotion.\r\nThe inner cube was always having to catch up, caboose-fashion, with\r\nthe outer one in time (or space, depending on one\'s perspective).\r\nAnd whenever it had done so, it would have arrived with itself--at\r\napproximately wherever in the space-time continuum it had been pointed.\r\n\r\nWhen they felt the jar of the settling geodesics, the crew crowded at\r\nthe forward visiplate to see where they were. It was the outskirts of\r\na G type star system. Silently they watched the innermost planet float\r\npast, scorched and craggy, its sunward side seeming about to relapse to\r\na molten state.\r\n\r\nThe Bosun-Colonel turned to the Conductor. "A bit of a disappointment\r\nI\'m afraid, sir. 

Surely with all that heat...?"\r\n\r\n"Steady, lad. The last wicket\'s not been bowled." The Conductor\'s\r\nwhiskers quivered in amusement at his next-in-command\'s impetuosity.\r\n"You\'ll notice that we\'re dropping downward. If the temperature\r\naccordingly continues dropping--"\r\n\r\nHe couldn\'t shrug, he wasn\'t physiologically capable of it, but it was\r\napparent that he felt they\'d soon reach a planet whose climate could\r\nsupport intelligent life.\r\n\r\nIf the Bosun-Colonel had any ideas that such directions as up and\r\ndown were meaningless in space, he kept them to himself. As the second\r\nplanet from its sun hove into view, he switched on the magniscan\r\neagerly.\r\n\r\n"I say, this is more like it. 

Clouds and all that sort of thing. 

Should\r\nwe have a go at it, sir?"\r\n\r\nThe Conductor yawned. "Too bloody cloudy for my taste. 

Too equivocal.\r\nLet\'s push on," he said languidly. "I have a hunch the third planet\r\nmight be just our dish of tea."\r\n\r\nQuelling his disappointment, the Bosun-Colonel waited for the third\r\nplanet to swim into being. And when it did, blooming like an orchid\r\nin all its greens and moistnesses, he could scarcely contain his\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n"Why, it looks just like Earth," he marveled. "Gad, sir, what a master\r\nstroke of navigation. 

How did you realize this would be it?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know," the Conductor said modestly. "Things usually have\r\na habit of occurring in threes. I\'m quite a student of numerology, you\r\nknow." Then he remembered the Mission and drew himself erect on all his\r\nlegs. "You may prepare for landing, Mister," he ordered crisply.\r\n\r\nThe Bosun-Colonel shifted over to manual and busied himself at the\r\nhelm, luffing the square craft down the troughs of air. Gliding over\r\nthe vast tropical oceans, he put down at a large land mass above a\r\nshallow warm sea, twenty-five degrees below the northern pole.\r\n\r\nToo numbed for comment, the crew stared out at the alien vista. They\'d\r\nheard of retarded life forms from other Missionary expeditions--of\r\nplanets where the inhabitants, in extreme emergency, had been known\r\nto commit murder. But this was surely the worst, the most vicious\r\nimaginable in the galaxy.\r\n\r\nHere, with life freshly up from the sea, freshly launched on the long\r\nclimb to maturity and self-realization--was nothing but horror. With so\r\nlush a vegetation, so easily capable of supporting them side by side\r\nin abundance, the monsters were actually feeding on each other. Great\r\nlumbering beasts they were with their bristling hides and huge tails,\r\ncharging between the giant tree ferns; gouging living chunks from one\r\nanother while razor-toothed birds with scaly wings flapped overhead,\r\nscreaming for the remnants. As the sounds of carnage came through the\r\naudio ports, the youngest Oarsman keeled over in a faint.\r\n\r\nEven the Conductor was visibly shaken. The Bosun-Colonel turned to him\r\nwith a sick expression.\r\n\r\n"Surely it\'s a lost cause, Skipper. Life like this will never have a\r\nsoul worth saving.

"\r\n\r\n"Not in its present stage," the Old Man was forced to agree. "Still,\r\none never knows the devious paths that evolution takes." He considered\r\nthe scene for a thoughtful, shuddering interval. "Perhaps in several\r\nthousand millenniums...."\r\n\r\nThe Bosun-Colonel tried to visualize the possibility of Ethical Life\r\never materializing through these swamp mists, but the logic against it\r\nwas too insurmountable for the imagination.\r\n\r\n"Even so," he conceded, "granting the impossible--whatever shape it\r\ntook, the only worthwhile species would still be...." He couldn\'t bring\r\nhimself to say it.\r\n\r\n"Meat-eaters," the Conductor supplied grimly.\r\n\r\nOn hearing this, the Oarsman who had just revived promptly fainted\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"It\'s too deep in the genes," the Conductor continued, "too far\r\nadvanced for us to tamper with. All we can hope to do is modify their\r\nmoral outlook. 

So that by the time they achieve star travel, they\'ll at\r\nleast have a basic sense of Fair Play."\r\n\r\nSighing, bowed by responsibilities incommensurate with his\r\nchronological youth, he gave the order wearily. It was snapped down the\r\nchain of command to the Senior Yardbird:\r\n\r\n"All paws stand by to lower the Ethics Ray! Step lively, lads--bugger\r\noff, now...."\r\n\r\nThere was a din of activity as the outer locks were opened and the\r\nbulky mechanism was shipped over the side. It squatted on a cleared\r\nrise of ground in all its complex, softly ticking majesty, waiting for\r\nthe First Human to pad within range of its shedding Grace and Uplift.\r\nThe work party scrambled back to the ship, anxious to be off this\r\nsinister terrain. Once more the crew gathered at the visiplate as the\r\nplanet fell away beneath them, the Ethics Ray winking in the day\'s last\r\nlight like a cornerstone. Or perhaps a tambourine....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNight closed down on the raw chaotic world, huge beasts closed in on\r\nthe strange star-fallen souvenir. They snuffled over it; then enraged\r\nat discovering it was nothing they could fill their clamoring mindless\r\nstomachs with, attempted to wreck it. They were unsuccessful, for\r\nthe Machine had been given an extra heavy coat of shellac and things\r\nto withstand such monkeyshines. And the Machine, in its own finely\r\ncalibrated way, ignored its harassers, for they had no resemblance to\r\nthe Life it had been tuned to influence.\r\n\r\nDays lengthened into decades, eons. The seas came shouldering in to\r\nstand towers tall above the Ethics Ray, lost in the far ooze below.\r\nThen even the seas receded, and the mountains buckled upward in their\r\nplace, their arrogant stone faces staring changelessly across the\r\nepochs. Until they too were whittled down by erosion. The ice caps\r\ncrept down, crackling and grinding the valleys. The ground stretched\r\nand tossed like a restless sleeper, settled, and the Ethics Ray was\r\nbrought to light once more.\r\n\r\nAs it always had, it continued beaming its particular signal, on\r\na cosmic ray carrier modulated by a pulse a particular number of\r\nangstroms below infrared. The beasts that blundered within its field\r\nwere entirely different now, but they still weren\'t the Right Ones.\r\nAmong them were some shambling pale bipeds, dressed in skins of other\r\nbeasts, who clucked over its gleaming exterior and tried to chip it\r\naway for spearheads. In this of course they were unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nAnd then one day the First Human wandered by, paused square in the\r\npath of the beam. His physiology was only approximate, his I.Q. was\r\nregrettably low--but he was Pre-Moral Life, such as it was, on this\r\nplanet.\r\n\r\nThe Ethics Ray made the necessary frequency adjustments, tripped on\r\nfull force. The Primitive froze under the bombardment, its germ plasm\r\nshifting in the most minute and subtle dimensions. Then, its mission\r\nfulfilled, the Ethics Ray collapsed into heavy molecules and sank into\r\nthe ground. The first convert raced away in fright, having no idea what\r\nhad happened. Neither did his billion sons and daughters....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBack on the home base, the Conductor reported in at the Ethication of\r\nPrimitive Planets office. It was a magnificently imposing building,\r\nas befitting the moral seat of the universe. And the Overseer was an\r\nequally imposing human with ears greyed by service. His congratulations\r\nwere unreserved.\r\n\r\n"A splendid mission, lad," he said, "and I don\'t mind\r\nsuggesting--strictly entre nous--that it could jolly well result in a\r\nFleet Conductorship for you."\r\n\r\nThe Conductor was overwhelmed.\r\n\r\n"Now just let me jot down the essentials while they\'re still fresh in\r\nmind," he continued, pawing through a desk drawer. "Botheration! 

I seem\r\nto have traded the last of my styluses. Do you happen to have one on\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"With pleasure." The Conductor handed over his monogrammed gold stylus,\r\nreceiving in exchange a toy silencemaker.\r\n\r\n"My youngster traded it to me this morning," the Overseer chuckled.\r\n\r\nHe wrote rapidly for several moments, then gave the stylus back. The\r\nConductor found a weathered paper-weight in his rear pocket, which he\r\ntraded him for it. It looked like it might have come from this very\r\ndesk at one time. Then with a smart salute, he about-faced.\r\n\r\nOn the way out, a pair of secretaries paused in their trading of a pelt\r\nbrush for a tail-curler to watch him admiringly. As well they might.\r\nFleet Conductor!\r\n\r\nThe future Fleet Conductor of a solar system he would never think of\r\ncalling Antares paused at the door. In its polished panel he regarded\r\nhimself with due appreciation. He had sown the seeds of civilization on\r\na far-flung planet where, countless light years from now, they would\r\nflower to maturity. Not among the strongest or cleverest species, to\r\nbe sure, but among those most worthy of applying First Principles, the\r\nmoral law of give and take.\r\n\r\nAmong those remote cousins of the Conductor himself--who under no\r\ncircumstances would ever think of himself as resembling a rather\r\noversized trader rat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


"\r\n\r\nDarquelnoy clicked his eyes in despair. "Those _things_!" he cried.\r\n"Those annoying little creatures on that blasted planet up there!"\r\n\r\nEbor repressed an amused ripple. He knew Darquelnoy well enough to\r\nknow that the commander invariably overstated things. "What\'ve they\r\nbeen up to, Dar?" 

he asked. "Come on, you can tell me over a hot cup\r\nof restno."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been practically living on the stuff for the last two dren,"\r\nsaid Darquelnoy hopelessly. "Well, I suppose another cup won\'t kill\r\nme. 

Come on to my quarters."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve worked up a fine thirst on the trip," Ebor told him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe two walked down the long corridor together and Ebor said, "Well?\r\nWhat happened?"\r\n\r\n"They came here," Darquelnoy told him simply. At Ebor\'s shocked look,\r\nhe rippled in wan amusement and said, "Oh, it wasn\'t as bad as it\r\nmight have been, I suppose. It was just that we had to rush around so\r\nfrantically, unloading and dismantling the dome, getting this place\r\nready--"\r\n\r\n"What do you mean, they _came_ here?" demanded Ebor.\r\n\r\n"They are absolutely the worst creatures for secrecy in the entire\r\ngalaxy!" exclaimed Darquelnoy in irritation. "Absolutely the worst."\r\n\r\n"Then you\'ve picked up at least one of their habits," Ebor told him.\r\n"Now stop talking in circles and tell me what happened."\r\n\r\n"They built a spaceship, is the long and the short of it," Darquelnoy\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\nEbor stopped in astonishment. "No!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t tell me no!" cried Darquelnoy. "I _saw_ it!" He was obviously\r\nat his wit\'s end.\r\n\r\n"It\'s unbelievable," said Ebor.\r\n\r\n"I know," said Darquelnoy. He led the way into his quarters, motioned\r\nEbor to a perch, and rang for his orderly. "It was just a little\r\nremote-controlled apparatus, of course," he said. 

"The fledgling\r\nattempt, you know. But it circled this Moon here, busily taking\r\npictures, and went right back to the planet again, giving us all a\r\nterrible fright. There hadn\'t been the slightest indication they were\r\nplanning anything _that_ spectacular."\r\n\r\n"None?" asked Ebor. "Not a hint?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, they\'ve been boasting about doing some such thing for ages,"\r\nDarquelnoy told him. "But there was never any indication that they\r\nwere finally serious about it. They have all sorts of military\r\nsecrecy, of course, and so you never know a thing is going to happen\r\nuntil it does."\r\n\r\n"Did they get a picture of the dome?"\r\n\r\n"Thankfully, no. 

And before they had a chance to try again, I whipped\r\neverything underground."\r\n\r\n"It must have been hectic," Ebor said sympathetically.\r\n\r\n"It was," said Darquelnoy simply.\r\n\r\nThe orderly entered. Darquelnoy told him, "Two restno," and he left\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t imagine them making a spaceship," said Ebor thoughtfully. "I\r\nwould have thought they\'d have blown themselves up long before\r\nreaching that stage."\r\n\r\n"I would have thought so, too," said Darquelnoy. "But there it is. At\r\nthe moment, they\'ve divided themselves into two camps--generally\r\nspeaking, that is--and the two sides are trying like mad to outdo each\r\nother in everything. As a part of it, they\'re shooting all sorts of\r\nrubbish into space and crowing every time a piece of the other side\'s\r\nrubbish malfunctions."\r\n\r\n"They could go on that way indefinitely," said Ebor.\r\n\r\n"I know," said Darquelnoy gloomily. "And here we sit."\r\n\r\nEbor nodded, studying his friend. "You don\'t suppose this is all a\r\nwaste of time, do you?" he asked, after a minute.\r\n\r\nDarquelnoy shook a tentacle in negation. "Not at all, not at all.\r\nThey\'ll get around to it, sooner or later. They\'re still boasting\r\nthemselves into the proper frame of mind, that\'s all."\r\n\r\nEbor rippled in sympathetic amusement. "I imagine you sometimes wish\r\nyou could give them a little prodding in the right direction," he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nDarquelnoy fluttered his tentacles in horror, crying, "Don\'t even\r\n_think_ of such a thing!"\r\n\r\n"I know, I know," said Ebor hastily. "The laws--"\r\n\r\n"Never mind the laws," snapped Darquelnoy. "I\'m not even thinking\r\nabout the laws. Frankly, if it would do any good, I might even\r\nconsider breaking one or two of the laws, and the devil with my\r\nconditioning."\r\n\r\n"You _are_ upset," said Ebor at that.\r\n\r\n"But if we were to interfere with those creatures up there," continued\r\nDarquelnoy, "interfere with them in any way at all, it would be\r\nabsolutely disastrous."\r\n\r\nThe orderly returned at that point, with two steaming cups of restno.\r\nDarquelnoy and Ebor accepted the cups and the orderly left, making a\r\nsloppy tentacle-cross salute, which the two ignored.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"I wasn\'t talking necessarily about attacking them, you know," said\r\nEbor, returning to the subject.\r\n\r\n"Neither was I," Darquelnoy told him. "We wouldn\'t have to attack\r\nthem. 

All we would have to do is let them know we\'re here. Not even\r\n_why_ we\'re here, just the simple fact of our presence. That would be\r\nenough. 

_They_ would attack _us_."\r\n\r\nEbor extended his eyes in surprise. "As vicious as all that?"\r\n\r\n"Chilling," Darquelnoy told him. "Absolutely chilling."\r\n\r\n"Then I\'m surprised they haven\'t blown themselves to pieces long\r\nbefore this."\r\n\r\n"Oh, well," said Darquelnoy, "you see, they\'re cowards, too. They have\r\nto boast and brag and shout a while before they finally get to clawing\r\nand biting at one another."\r\n\r\nEbor waved a tentacle. "Don\'t make it so vivid."\r\n\r\n"Sorry," apologized Darquelnoy. He drained his cup of restno. "Out\r\nhere," he said, "living next door to the little beasts day after day,\r\none begins to lose one\'s sensibilities."\r\n\r\n"It has been a long time," agreed Ebor.\r\n\r\n"Longer than we had originally anticipated," Darquelnoy said frankly.\r\n"We\'ve been ready to move in for I don\'t know how long. And instead we\r\njust sit here and wait. 

Which isn\'t good for morale, either."\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t imagine it is."\r\n\r\n"There\'s already a theory among some of the workmen that the blow-up\r\njust isn\'t going to happen, ever. And since that ship went circling\r\nby, of course, morale has hit a new low."\r\n\r\n"It would have been nasty if they\'d spotted you," said Ebor.\r\n\r\n"Nasty?" echoed Darquelnoy. "Catastrophic, you mean. All that crowd up\r\nthere needs is an enemy, and it doesn\'t much matter to them who that\r\nenemy is. If they were to suspect that we were here, they\'d forget\r\ntheir own little squabbles at once and start killing us instead. And\r\nthat, of course, would mean that they\'d be united, for the first time\r\nin their history, and who knows how long it would take them before\r\nthey\'d get back to killing one another again."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Ebor, "you\'re underground now. And it can\'t possibly take\r\nthem _too_ much longer.

"\r\n\r\n"One wouldn\'t think so," agreed Darquelnoy. "In a way," he added,\r\n"that spaceship was a hopeful sign. It means that they\'ll be sending a\r\nmanned ship along pretty soon, and that should do the trick. As soon\r\nas one side has a base on the Moon, the other side is bound to get\r\nthings started.

"\r\n\r\n"A relief for you, eh?" said Ebor.\r\n\r\n"You know," said Darquelnoy thoughtfully, "I can\'t help thinking I was\r\nborn in the wrong age. All this scrabbling around, searching\r\neverywhere for suitable planets. 

Back when the Universe was younger,\r\nthere were lots and lots of planets to colonize. Now the old problem\r\nof half-life is taking its toll, and we can\'t even hope to keep up\r\nwith the birth rate any more. If it weren\'t for the occasional planets\r\nlike that one up there, I don\'t know what we\'d do."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t worry," Ebor told him. "They\'ll have their atomic war pretty\r\nsoon, and leave us a nice high-radiation planet to colonize."\r\n\r\n"I certainly hope it\'s soon," said Darquelnoy. 

"This waiting gets on\r\none\'s nerves." He rang for the orderly.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n


(The relatives\r\nusually take care of all that.) No bother at all, really.\r\n\r\nI skipped back to the desk, flipped up the telephone, and began poking\r\na finger into the little holes in the dial.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Pasquamine?" I chimed, after hearing the faint click at the other\r\nend of the wire.\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"This is T. J.," I said, chummily. "You still own that block of\r\nfloating stock in the Remey Company, don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Fine! Fine!" 

I complimented. "Bring it over to my office as soon as\r\npossible. And, by the way," I added, casually, "have it transferred to\r\nmy name, you know."\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nHe was in my office in less than an hour, his fat hulk sweating and\r\npanting in the chair before my desk, the heavy lids drooping over his\r\nblack eyes. The stocks were piled neatly before me. 

I thumbed through\r\nthem. 

They seemed to be quite in order. I skipped across the room to\r\nthe files with them.\r\n\r\n"Pasquamine," I said, returning to my desk and handing him a cheap\r\ncigar, "do you by chance own a gun?"\r\n\r\nHe shook his fat head. 

"No."\r\n\r\n"Do you have at home, perchance, a rope?" I glanced at his obese body.\r\n"A good stout one?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"A knife, perhaps? 

A good sharp one?"\r\n\r\nHis oily face beamed quickly. "Ah, Mr. Nelson! That I have! Sharp for\r\nthe salami!" He kissed his thick fingers and made a flipping motion\r\ninto the air with them. "Sharp for the good big salami!"\r\n\r\n"Excellent!" I nodded quick approbation. "Go home and cut your throat\r\nwith it."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe pushed his hulk up from the chair and walked toward the door.\r\n\r\n"And don\'t bother about coming back to the office afterwards," I\r\nadmonished.\r\n\r\nHe paused, hand on the knob, and turned. Then his round face lighted\r\nup. 

"Ah, Mr. Nelson!" he chuckled. "You make with the joke!"\r\n\r\n"Sure." I smiled. "And now you go home and make with the knife."\r\n\r\nThat was the last time I saw Pasquamine. Except at the funeral, of\r\ncourse. He made a lovely corpse--considering everything.\r\n\r\nIt was the day following the funeral when there came a gentle tapping\r\nat my office door.\r\n\r\n"Come in," I said, tossing the half-finished bottle of gin back into\r\nthe lower drawer.\r\n\r\nThey didn\'t bother about opening the door; they just crawled under it.\r\nA moment later, they had slithered across the floor, had wiggled their\r\nway up to the top on my desk, and had flattened out upon its polished\r\nsurface in complete pseudopod relaxation. Gyf and Gyl. My two very good\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n"Sorry, boys," I said, after we had exchanged the usual amenities,\r\n"that I had to get rid of your symbiotics in such a messy fashion. But\r\nbusiness is business, you know; and I felt that the time was right...."\r\n\r\nGyf shrugged gelatinously. "I was getting tired of occupying Fidwell,\r\nanyway," he vibrated. "Regular old pussyfoot. Never had no fun."\r\n\r\nGyl burped resoundingly in the middle. "I hope the next body I get\r\ndoesn\'t turn out to be another wine-guzzling, garlic eater." A tremor\r\nran through him. 

"It upsets me frightfully."\r\n\r\n"Time and the rising tide of accidents will tell," I soothed.\r\n\r\n"I\'m cold," trembled Gyf, "since I ain\'t got no body to keep me warm."\r\n\r\n"You might try my secretary," I offered, playfully. "There\'s a body for\r\nyou!"\r\n\r\n"You know I can\'t," he vibrated. "She ain\'t even dead yet!"\r\n\r\n"Nearest thing to it," I commented, "this side of the precinct morgue."\r\n\r\nThat brought a shake of mirth from Gyl who really has a truly\r\nremarkable sense of humor.\r\n\r\nGyf, ignoring the levity, slid over to the little intercom box at one\r\nside of the desk, crawled in through one of the slits, curled up, and\r\npromptly went to sleep. It seems that Fidwell, along with his other\r\nfaults, had also been a sufferer of insomnia.\r\n\r\n"I suppose," I said to Gyl, conversationally, "you\'ll be wanting a new\r\nbody now...."\r\n\r\n"Not necessarily. Not right away." 

He edged away from the blotter\r\nmy desk fan was blowing in his direction. "Want to wait--" A burp\r\nnearly flipped him again. "--until these garlic fumes effervesce more\r\ncompletely from my system."\r\n\r\n"It worked out wonderfully well, though," I said, "even though you\r\ndid have to put up with the garlic for awhile." I brought out the gin\r\nbottle from the lower drawer. "It was certainly fortunate that Gyf\r\nwas on hand to occupy Fidwell just after his wife murdered him." I\r\nunstoppered the bottle and raised it to my lips. "To Fidwell, departed\r\npartner and erstwhile owner of the Remey Company!"\r\n\r\n"And the joke was on Mrs. Fidwell," sparkled Gyl\'s sense of humor.\r\n"Just imagine: seeing her husband up walking around, hale and hearty,\r\njust a half hour after she had throttled the life out of him with her\r\nown two hands!"\r\n\r\n"No wonder she had to be locked up," I chuckled, pouring a few drops of\r\ngin on the polished glass near my companion.\r\n\r\n"My getting the body of Pasquamine, owner of the floating stock, wasn\'t\r\nso bad either," he reminded me, isolating a drop of gin and flowing\r\naround it.\r\n\r\nI admitted the fact.\r\n\r\n"He nearly crushed me, too, when he tumbled," Gyl reminded. "I\'d been\r\nfollowing him two weeks, waiting for his fat heart to do a flopperoo."\r\n\r\nWe both laughed. I took another drink, and Gyl osmosed a nip.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFinally, I leaned across the desk. "Listen, Gyl," I said, coldly\r\nserious. "Now that this little deal is over, how would you like to get\r\nin on something else? Something really _big_?

"\r\n\r\nHe instantly became all ears. 

(Naturally, only a pseudopod can do it.)\r\n\r\n"After I sell out Remey," I continued, "we\'ll have ample funds. So-o,\r\nif we moved over to Washington, D. C.... If you and Gyf could get in\r\ntouch with a couple tottering congressmen who are about ready to depart\r\nfrom this vale of tears...."\r\n\r\nGyl caught on immediately. "T. J.," he complimented, "you\'ve _got_\r\nsomething!"\r\n\r\nHe fell silent, and I knew he was letting the gin and the thought\r\ntrickle through him, savoring both from various angles. Then he\r\nvibrated, dreamily, "I\'ve always wanted to be a congressman. Or--or\r\na cabinet member. Or--" His vibration dropped to little more than a\r\nwhisper, "--or a _president_!"\r\n\r\n"Sorry," I said, "but I believe he is already possessed."\r\n\r\nGyl flowed around another drop of gin. "Oh, well," he said dismissing\r\nthe ambition, "guess he doesn\'t have much to say about things, anyway."\r\nThen he brightened. "But there are some mighty fine bureaus and\r\ndepartments there. We could wiggle our way into one of those. A few\r\nmillion dollars here and there wouldn\'t be missed."\r\n\r\n"Atta boy! I\'ll take you and Gyf over to Washington in the morning,\r\nthen I\'ll come back here and dispose of the business while the two of\r\nyou are getting established." It sounded like a good idea. Within a few\r\nyears we\'d be rolling in the filthy stuff.\r\n\r\nI poured a few more drops of gin on the glass top, then raised the\r\nbottle. "Here\'s to happy days in the Pentagon!" I toasted.\r\n\r\nOur spirits were soon soaring to great heights, and, as usual under\r\nsuch circumstances, Gyl began talking about the "good old days" when\r\nyou could pick up a likely corpse almost anywhere, anytime.\r\n\r\n"Used to be so much simpler then," he commented, flowing around one\r\nof the fresh drops. "Now you have to beat the embalmer!" He chuckled.\r\n"Fairly close race at times, too! But it keeps one on one\'s pseudotoes,\r\nso to speak!" A combined burp and hiccough nearly flopped him off the\r\ndesk.\r\n\r\nAfter he had regained his equilibrium we spent an enjoyable\r\nhalf-hour talking of cadavers, funeral homes, the comparative merits\r\nof inhabiting youthful or wealthy bodies, and other delightfully\r\nstimulating subjects. Then we began to sing songs, old and new.\r\n\r\nWe had finished the chorus of "We Have All the Dough of Remey" for the\r\nthird time and were just getting warmed up on an extemporization of\r\n"We\'ll Carry On in the Pentagon" when the office door flew suddenly\r\nopen and two Federal boys stepped in, followed by my stupid-looking\r\nsecretary.\r\n\r\nThey came quickly to the desk. One of them grabbed a handful of Gyl\r\nwith one hand and pointed a gun at me with the other. "Just stay as you\r\nare," the officer cautioned.\r\n\r\nMy dumb secretary stared at me with round, innocent eyes. "I couldn\'t\r\nhelp hearing everything you said, Mr. 

Nelson," she chirped, half\r\napologetically. "Your intercom box was open. Must be a short in it\r\nsomewhere. Or a loose connection...."\r\n\r\nThe other officer picked up the little box and shook it. A surprised\r\nGyf felt out from between the slats....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey have Gyf and Gyl in a little bottle now, tightly stoppered and\r\nready for shipment back home to Venus. They\'ll be placed on the next\r\nspace ship heading out.\r\n\r\nThere is a stupid Terrestrial law, you know, which makes it mandatory\r\nthat all Venusians be apprehended on sight or extracted from any body\r\nthey may be occupying and sent back to Venus in all possible haste.\r\n\r\nAnd so I shall soon be extracted from the body of T. J. Nelson and his\r\nneck will bend double in the middle again just the way it was when I\r\nfound him shortly after his accident. Then, in a little bottle of my\r\nown, I shall accompany Gyf and Gyl homeward.\r\n\r\nBut, don\'t worry, I\'ll be back! I\'ll be back just as soon as I can\r\nhitch a ride on a returning spaceboat!\r\n\r\nSo take good care of yourself, my friend, and don\'t catch pneumonia or\r\nstep in front of a truck or anything like that--_until I return_.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\nColen Shratt studied his image in the silver-framed mirror. His\r\nmustache was neatly clipped, his face clean shaven and well talcumed.\r\nHis captain\'s uniform--light blue--was pressed and looked as if it had\r\njust been bought. He was fastidious in everything he did.\r\n\r\nHe looked away from the mirror as the valet approached.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Barnes is ready to see you, sir," the valet said.\r\n\r\n"Good."\r\n\r\nCaptain Shratt was ushered into a study where Jules Barnes was waiting.\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you be seated?" Barnes invited.\r\n\r\nThe captain sat, laid his cap on his knee.\r\n\r\n"A drink?"\r\n\r\n"No, thank you.

"\r\n\r\n"Mind if I have one?"\r\n\r\n"Of course not."\r\n\r\nBarnes fixed himself a drink. He seated himself on a sofa, leaned back\r\nand said: "Now what\'s it all about? What would an intelligence officer\r\nwant with me?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not only representing the Americas at this moment, Mr. Barnes,\r\nbut all of earth as well. I\'m here to ask you to do a service for the\r\nworld."\r\n\r\n"A service?" Barnes sipped at his drink. "You must be mistaken about me\r\ncaptain. I\'m just a playwright."\r\n\r\n"But I haven\'t made a mistake, Mr. Barnes. And you _can_ save the\r\nworld. Just by writing a play.

"\r\n\r\n"Oh, come now."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Barnes, within two months we shall have a visitor from Mars."\r\n\r\nJules Barnes finished his drink. "You don\'t say?"\r\n\r\n"I do say."\r\n\r\n"Are you sure you won\'t have a drink? Or have you had too many?"\r\n\r\n"Mind if I use your phone?

"\r\n\r\n"Go right ahead."\r\n\r\nThe captain dialled a number, said into the mouthpiece: "General?...\r\nShratt. I\'m at Barnes.... Yes. 

Of course. Have the President put on,\r\nwill you?" The captain turned to Barnes. "You\'d recognize the voice of\r\nWilliam Livingstone, the President of the Americas, wouldn\'t you?"\r\n\r\nBarnes nodded his head silently.\r\n\r\nHe took the receiver from Shratt and listened gravely.\r\n\r\nThe captain watched the playwright put down the receiver. "Well?" 

he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nBarnes sat down, gulped noisily. "I\'m listening."\r\n\r\n"We\'re going to have a visitor from the planet Mars. Now supposedly,\r\nthey will be on a friendly mission. But that will not be so. Their\r\npurpose is to determine our strength. If they decide we are ahead in\r\nnuclear physics and rocket-ship expansion we will be attacked. If they\r\ndecide we are behind in experiments then we will be safe."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t understand. Why shouldn\'t they attack us if they know we are\r\nweak?"\r\n\r\n"They\'re not in any great hurry. If they believe we are strong and\r\nready to launch rocket ships into space then they will stop us,\r\ndetermined we should never leave our planet to conquer space. If they\r\nbelieve we are weak and backward, they will let us alone, for the time\r\nbeing. As long as we aren\'t a threat then they\'ll feel safe, ready to\r\nconquer us at their own sweet time. They move when they think we\'re\r\nstrong, ready to blast ships into space, ready to conquer the stars.\r\nTill then they\'ll let us alone, knowing we\'re weak and ineffectual."\r\n\r\n"How do you know all this?" Barnes asked, moving to make himself and\r\nShratt drinks. This time, the captain accepted his drink. "How can you\r\npossibly know of their plans?"\r\n\r\n"We\'ve picked up their ship by radar. We\'ve been listening in on their\r\nconversations with Mars through a new I.B.M. machine. And Germany\r\nhas sent their best code experts to give a hand. They broke down the\r\nlanguage. And the messages between Mars and their ship was in code.\r\nSo the experts did a double job, and well too, I might add. All the\r\ngovernments of the world have been alerted. 

They\'re all ready to\r\ncooperate.

"\r\n\r\n"Well, where do I come in?"\r\n\r\n"We want you to write a play."\r\n\r\n"A play?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. A play. And every industry on earth will be a participant. You\r\nwill write and direct. The world will be the stage. Don\'t you see? You\r\nwill write and direct every move that will convince the Martians we are\r\nbackward, we are nothing, we are insignificant. They must be convinced\r\nour industry doesn\'t compare with theirs, our brains are childish to\r\ntheirs, our leaders are weak and ineffectual, our weapons mere toys.\r\nYou must write this play before they get here. It will be your greatest\r\ntriumph. It will be the play of all plays. It will be the play that\r\nwill save the world from destruction. It must be written within a\r\nmonth. 

That\'s what we want you to do."\r\n\r\n"Within a month? That\'s impossible."\r\n\r\n"A month to write the play. A month to rehearse. Not even a month to\r\nrehearse. You have to get busy on it right away."\r\n\r\n"But how far are you advanced? Can you conquer space tomorrow?"\r\n\r\n"Of course not."\r\n\r\n"Then why go to all this trouble? Just let them see for themselves the\r\nway things really are. We can\'t possibly hurt them now. Why bother\r\nputting on an act for them?"\r\n\r\n"We are advanced to some degree, of course. Progress can\'t be stopped.\r\nBut we don\'t want them to know exactly how advanced we are. They are\r\nour enemy, you must remember that. We have to show them we are weaker\r\nthan we really are."\r\n\r\n"I see your logic."\r\n\r\n"Good. You will cooperate with us, then?"\r\n\r\n"Of course."\r\n\r\n"You realize that it must be a silent triumph for you, if we are\r\nsuccessful."\r\n\r\n"Of course. I\'m at your service."\r\n\r\n"You will start immediately. I\'ll keep in touch with you daily. You\'ll\r\nneed facts and figures, of course. You\'ll get a list of industry heads,\r\nscientists, and military men. They\'ll all be meeting our Martians. They\r\nmust have their lines to read, their every movements that will convince\r\nthe Martians of our stupidity."\r\n\r\n"It\'s going to be some political football at the next election. You\r\ncan\'t keep the politicians silent."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, we can."\r\n\r\n"This will be more like a project than a play."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll have to take my leave now, Mr. Barnes." The Captain stood up. "I\r\nhave many matters to attend to."\r\n\r\n"Of course. Good day, captain."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJules Barnes worked on his play every waking hour. His eyes grew tired,\r\nhis fingers grew stiff, his brain grew weary. The play was finished in\r\ntwenty-five days. He handed it to Captain Shratt and went to sleep five\r\nminutes later.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCaptain Shratt shrugged off all suggestion of getting a top Broadway\r\ndirector to handle the second assignment, that of directing the\r\nparticipants of the play. So Jules Barnes directed the military, the\r\nindustry, the sciences, in their performances which would take place\r\nwhen the adversary would come face to face with the earth\'s genius.\r\n\r\nBarnes and Shratt went from government to government by jet, meeting\r\nthe brains of each power, directing and coaching.\r\n\r\n"Finished," Captain Shratt said, leaning back in his seat as the jet\r\ntook off for Washington.\r\n\r\n"What if it doesn\'t come off?" Barnes said.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t think about it."\r\n\r\nBarnes felt his stomach jump toward his back as the ship hummed its way\r\ntowards the heavens. He still hadn\'t gotten used to the jets. When the\r\nplane leveled off, he said: "We could always capture the Martians, hold\r\nthem as hostages."\r\n\r\n"Do you possibly think they hold as great a price on life as we do?\r\nTheir philosophy is as different from ours as night and day."\r\n\r\n"You seem to know an awful lot about them."\r\n\r\n"Our men are listening in on every conversation that passes between\r\ntheir ship and Mars. We\'ve learned a lot."\r\n\r\n"I\'m beginning to think you\'re more advanced than you\'re letting on."\r\n\r\n"In many matters, Mr. Barnes you\'re still an outsider. Security, you\r\nmust understand. 

Especially now. You\'ve done the earth a great service\r\nbut I\'m still under orders. There are many things I can\'t let you in\r\non. If you were a soldier, you\'d readily understand. So a certain wall,\r\nnot too high, though, must always remain between us."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not a soldier, true, but I do understand."\r\n\r\n"You may be interested to know that the ship will be landing within the\r\nweek."\r\n\r\n"Really? I guess I\'d better stay out of the way."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you\'ll be on hand. In case something goes wrong and a new line\r\nmust be written into the script fast. There must be no blunders. If\r\nthere are then we must cover up. So you\'ll be close by, ready to write,\r\nready to coach."\r\n\r\n"I wonder what they\'ll look like.

"\r\n\r\n"You\'ll be finding out soon enough."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn order to avert panic, the world was alerted to the coming of the\r\nMartians four days before the strange arrival.\r\n\r\nThey came.\r\n\r\nTall and thin with translucent skin and eyes that were almost\r\ninvisible, they were that small. There were four. 

Two men and two\r\nwomen. The women\'s hair was as short as the men\'s. Their breasts made\r\nslight bulges under their tunics.\r\n\r\nIt seemed they had listened in to radio broadcasts and spoke English,\r\nFrench, Italian, Polish, and Spanish very well. They knew the Americas\r\nwas the strongest of the world governments and so had landed there. The\r\nyear, 1968, became a memorable year. The year when contact was made\r\nwith another planet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJules Barnes stayed on the sidelines. During the three weeks the\r\nMartians remained there was no need for him. But he stayed by, ready to\r\nact in any way he was needed.\r\n\r\nThe Martians went from government to government, inspecting industry,\r\nmeeting scientists and military men. Everything was as friendly as\r\ncould be. When the Martians retired to their rooms, they had hurried\r\nconversations. We were behind the times, our scientists were incredibly\r\nstupid, our military men were old ladies and our industry was only fit\r\nto make children\'s toys.\r\n\r\nHidden microphones revealed all this.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Everything has gone according to plan," Captain Shratt told Barnes the\r\nday the Martians blasted off for their home planet. "We\'ve nothing to\r\nworry about.

"\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad. I\'ve been on edge the whole time they were here."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got reports to make out so I\'ll have to leave now. 

But we\'ll get\r\ntogether again sometime."\r\n\r\n"Certainly." Barnes shook hands and Shratt left the playwright\'s\r\napartment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Hello, General," Captain Shratt said, entering his office. He took off\r\nhis cap, tossed it on a leather chair, and went behind his desk.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve come from the president," the general said. "He says the time has\r\ncome."\r\n\r\n"Good." Shratt sat down. "I wish I was coming along."\r\n\r\n"You\'re needed here. What about this fellow Barnes? He knows an awful\r\nlot."\r\n\r\n"We\'ve nothing to worry from him. Besides, once we\'ve started there\'s\r\nnothing anyone can do."\r\n\r\n"Our fleet of Space ships is ready to take off within hours."\r\n\r\n"It\'s best to wait till the Martian ship is well on its way. Then we\r\ncan start operations. When we get to Mars they\'ll be unprepared. Earth\r\nwill be supreme." Captain Shratt lit a cigarette. "Only Mars could have\r\nstopped us if they\'d decided to attack us. Now that threat is gone.\r\nThey won\'t know what hit them. 

Thanks to a playwright and his sense of\r\ndevotion to earth."\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\n"Good morning, madam," Ira said. "I represent...."\r\n\r\n"We don\'t want any," said the women, easing the door shut.\r\n\r\nWith the time tested finesse of door-to-door salesmen, Ira slipped his\r\nsize twelve shoe between the swinging door and the jamb. "But madam, if\r\nyou\'ll give me a few minutes of your time...."\r\n\r\nThe woman shook her head. "It won\'t do you any good," she said, trying\r\nto squeeze the door shut over his foot. "Whatever it is, we don\'t want\r\nany.

"\r\n\r\n"I represent U.S. Robot Company," Ira persisted. He smiled pleasantly.\r\nHis unyielding foot maintained a six inch wide avenue of communication\r\nbetween himself and the woman in the house. "Long the leader in\r\ncommercial and industrial mechanicals, U.S. Robot is now introducing\r\na new line of home servants, designed to assist the housewife in every\r\npossible task about the house."\r\n\r\n"You\'re wasting your time," the woman said wearily.\r\n\r\nIra used his professional smile to indicate that he enjoyed wasting his\r\ntime. "When you\'ve seen the demonstration," he said, "I\'m sure you\'ll\r\nagree that no home should be without a Model I household robot."\r\n\r\nThe woman looked out at him silently, patiently, resigned. 

She was\r\npretty and petite and very young; and, from her appearance, had never\r\ndone a day\'s work in her life. 

A typical newlywed, Ira thought. A\r\nperfect prospect, he decided.\r\n\r\n"As you undoubtedly know, the outstanding characteristics of U.S.\r\nRobot mechanicals have always been ability, durability and reliability.\r\nTheir performance in industry has earned for the United States Robot\r\nCompany the enviable reputation it is proud to possess: \'Leader in the\r\nart, artist of the trade--if it\'s U.S. Robot, it\'s perfect!\'"\r\n\r\nThe woman smiled and allowed the door to swing open slightly. "What\r\nabout Amalgamated Androids?" she asked. 

"I understand they\'ve got some\r\npretty good models, too."\r\n\r\n"Well," Ira admitted, "some of their models are pretty good; adequate,\r\nperhaps. But why take anything but the best? And, of course, our\r\nrobots...."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve seen some AA models that _are_ perfect," the woman said. A\r\nsuggestion of a smile tugged at the corner of her mouth. "How can yours\r\nbe any better than perfect?"\r\n\r\nIra\'s voice took on a confidential complexion. "Some of their models\r\nare beautiful," he conceded. "And they may seem to work well when\r\nthey\'re new. But they\'re not built to last, like ours. Why...."\r\n\r\n"I think," the woman tried to interrupt, "that some of...."\r\n\r\n"How can you compare them to U.S. Robot?" 

Ira ran on. "We have had\r\nforty-seven years of experience in producing mechanicals for the most\r\ndifficult jobs imaginable. Amalgamated Androids while producing an\r\nadequate household model, does not have the valuable know-how to build\r\ninto their mechanicals the strength and quality that is taken for\r\ngranted in every machine bearing the U.S. Robot label."\r\n\r\nThe woman was skeptical. "Maybe your company does make the best factory\r\nhands," she argued, "but household robots must be esthetic as well as\r\nrugged. And Amalgamated Androids are specialists in building humanoid\r\nrobots, while your company...."\r\n\r\n"But, madam," Ira said, grinning. "Our household models are perfectly\r\nhuman in appearance--I should say, _im_perfectly human because we even\r\ngive them tiny blemishes to make them seem more natural."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe woman was obviously unconvinced. Ira applied the clincher. "What\r\ngreater proof could you want than this?" He held up his left hand,\r\nbaring his wrist so that she could read his identification stamp.\r\n\r\n    _Model I (Masc.)_\r\n    _Serial No. 27146 12V_\r\n    _U.S. ROBOT CO., INC._\r\n\r\nThe woman\'s eyes widened. Her face took on an expression of delighted\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n"What better proof could you want?" Ira repeated. "Do I look like a\r\nrobot? 

Am I not a perfect humanoid? Here," he said, extending his hand,\r\n"feel my skin and see if it isn\'t just like a man\'s."\r\n\r\nThe woman gingerly touched his hand. 

Her eyes mirrored her\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nIra pressed his advantage. "Model I robots come in both masculine and\r\nfeminine designs, built to your individual specifications as to size,\r\ncoloring, strength, personality traits, apparent age, and so forth. For\r\nexample, lonely people can have companionship built in, if they like.\r\nYou can have an Ira or Inez possessing an almost human intelligence and\r\nfree choice, or you can get one that is blindly servile and which will\r\nnever volunteer advice or information. You can get an elderly, refined\r\nbutler or a handsome young man-around-the-house. You can get a pretty,\r\npetite parlor maid or a buxom cook."\r\n\r\nIra paused to observe his customer. She was looking at him in a\r\npeculiar way. Knowing that he was a robot, she seemed to be appraising\r\nhim as she would a man. Ira noted her odd reaction and puzzled over it.\r\nIt usually went the other way--women lost interest in him when they\r\nlearned that he was not a man.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you come inside," the woman suggested suddenly, opening the\r\ndoor for him.\r\n\r\nIra smiled at her graciously and went into the house. Her reaction was\r\nnot so puzzling, after all, he decided. A young and virtuous wife would\r\nfeel the conventional fears that were "built into her" by society. She\r\nhad to be careful. It was conceivably dangerous to be alone in the\r\nhouse with a handsome man. But, if he\'s a robot, she has nothing to\r\nfear--from him or herself.\r\n\r\n"Sit down," the woman said, "and rest a while."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, madam." 

He sat. "But, of course, I don\'t need the rest.\r\nModel I\'s can do strenuous work for twenty-three out of every\r\ntwenty-four hours. In fact, in laboratory tests, they\'ve been run for\r\none hundred and eighty-six hours continuously, without a breakdown."\r\n\r\nHe was back in his sales pitch. "Work is the basic function of all\r\nU.S. Robot Company robots. With all their esthetic perfection, the\r\nhousehold models are no exception to this rule. They are unequaled in\r\nefficient performance. Power is the keynote of the Model I."\r\n\r\nHe opened his demonstration case and removed a steel bar, three inches\r\nin diameter. Placing one hand on each end, he bent the metal into a V.\r\n\r\n"The heart of the mechanism," he went on, "is a powerful twelve volt\r\nA-battery, perfectly shielded and guaranteed to give trouble-free\r\nservice for at least forty years. Sixteen motor centers are fed by\r\nthe central power plant, all coordinated and synchronized by the best\r\nflui-electronic brain ever devised. Sturdy TS steel alloy construction\r\nover all gives the Model I its phenomenal strength and durability. And\r\nthe surface tissue, made of a new patented miracle material, combines\r\nthe best features of esthetic and functional performance."\r\n\r\nThe woman was obviously impressed. Lips slightly parted, she watched\r\nIra attentively and listened breathlessly to everything he said.\r\nInstinctively, he felt that he had made a sale. But the woman said\r\nnothing; only gazed at him in a way that might have been covetous,\r\nmight have been adoring or might have been merely symptomatic of\r\nhypnosis.\r\n\r\n"May I demonstrate the I\'s power and versatility in practical\r\nperformance?" Ira asked. Taking her silence to be consent, he swung\r\ninto his demonstration.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSwiftly, surely, he went about the room, cleaning. Effortlessly, he\r\nlifted large pieces of furniture and, holding them aloft with his right\r\nhand, he cleaned under them with his left. He talked as he worked.\r\n"Notice the quiet efficiency of the self-cleansing electro-static\r\nduster we have built in. We also have attachments for waxing, washing,\r\nspraying, painting, ironing, soldering...."\r\n\r\n"You\'re wonderful," the woman sighed.\r\n\r\n"And let me point out," Ira pursued, eager to clinch the sale, "that\r\nthe Model I is so life-like that, in normal operation, it is almost\r\ncompletely silent. Only a faint throbbing--like that of a human\r\nheart--is noticeable.

"\r\n\r\nThe woman cocked her head to a side. "I don\'t hear _anything_," she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nIra smiled triumphantly. "Of course, you don\'t! Come here," he said.\r\n"Put your ear to my chest and you\'ll just be able to make it out."\r\n\r\nShe rested her head on his chest and listened. The delicate fragrance\r\nof her perfume mingled with that sweet human scent that not even\r\nthe Model I robots could imitate. Ira bent his head and brushed his\r\nsensitized cheek against her hair. He felt emotions that no robot\r\nshould feel.\r\n\r\nHe silently cursed his makers and the wonderfully human brain they had\r\ngiven him. Their theory was that a salesman, to be effective, should\r\nthink exactly like a human being. To better satisfy the customers, he\r\nshould appreciate every human drive and desire. But it was wrong to\r\nfeel like a man, to desire like a man, to hurt like a man and be unable\r\nto ease the pain because he was not a man! For once, U.S. Robot had\r\ngone too far!\r\n\r\nThe woman looked up at him with the eyes that broadcast adoration.\r\n"You\'re wonderful!" she repeated. 

"Do you think...?" She hesitated,\r\nlooked away. "Could I be in love with you?" she asked with child-like\r\ninnocence. "Is it possible?"\r\n\r\nIra felt flustered, giddy, light-headed, exultant, confused, miserable\r\nand weak. Damn U.S. Robot and their perfected flui-electronics! "But\r\nmadam," he protested, "I\'m not a man! I\'m only a...."\r\n\r\n"Please call me Emma," the woman said. "You see, I\'m not Mrs. Bartlett.\r\nI\'ve tried to tell you--Madam is not at home. I only work here.

"\r\n\r\nGone was his exultant feeling, gone the light-headedness. Only the\r\nmisery and weakness remained in the realization that his yearning was\r\nimpossible of fulfillment and that, to top it off, he had wasted his\r\ntime trying to sell himself to a servant.\r\n\r\n"Do you think I could?" the maid repeated.\r\n\r\n"Could what?"\r\n\r\n"Be in love with you."\r\n\r\n"But, miss don\'t you understand? I\'m not...."\r\n\r\n"My name is Emma," she said softly. She smiled and he fought down an\r\noverwhelming urge to touch her, to kiss her pink, inviting lips. He\r\nstood rigid. He wanted to cry out in his torment.\r\n\r\nHer hand reached out to him and he felt her fingers touch his.\r\nElectricity tingled up his arm and through his chest. Automatically, he\r\nrepeated his cursed disavowal of humanness. Vaguely, he heard his own\r\nwords, sounding like an echo in his ears. "I\'m a robot."\r\n\r\n"I know," Emma said quietly. Then, she held up her right hand,\r\nrevealing the identification stamp on her wrist.\r\n\r\n    _Model M (fem.)_\r\n    _Serial No. 6139 12V_\r\n    _AMALGAMATED ANDROIDS, INC._\r\n\r\nA moment later the android was in his arms. He held her close, dizzy\r\nwith the sensation of this new emotion with one of his own kind.\r\n\r\nSeveral moments later he pushed her gently away from him. "Pack your\r\nbag, Emma," he said.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him starry-eyed but quizzically. "But my work--madam will\r\nbe furious--"\r\n\r\n"Your bag, Emma," he repeated. "When our companies built us they made\r\nus as near human as possible--perhaps too much so. If we can work\r\nfor humans we can also live like them. U.S. Robots and Amalgamated\r\nAndroids have just lost two employees. Your bag."\r\n\r\nBeing an android she could work faster than any human counter-part; her\r\nbag was packed in nothing flat.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy me? Why, out of 300 billion people on earth, why did they have to\r\npick on _me_?\r\n\r\nAnd if it had to happen, why couldn\'t it have happened before I met\r\nBetty and fell in love with her? You see, Betty and I were to be\r\nmarried tomorrow. We _were_ to have been married. Tomorrow.\r\n\r\nTomorrow, indeed! What a ghastly thought that is! How can I explain\r\nto Betty--to anyone! I can\'t face her, and what could I say on the\r\ntelephone? "Sorry, Betty, I can\'t marry you. I\'m no longer--quite\r\nhuman."\r\n\r\nQuit joking, Kelley! This is for real. 

You\'re sober and awake and it\r\ndid happen. Marrying Betty is out of the question even if she\'d have\r\nyou the way you are. You\'re not _that_ two-faced!\r\n\r\nQuit standing in front of the mirror, naked and shaking, looking\r\nfor scars, counting your fingers and toes. You\'ve taken a hundred\r\ninventories, and it always comes out wrong. And it always will,\r\nunless ... unless _they_ come back. But that\'s hopeless. They\'d never\r\nfind me again. Not out of all the people on earth. 

Besides, they\r\ndidn\'t seem to give a damn. No more than a kid gives a damn what\r\nhappens to a lump of modelling clay when he gets bored squeezing it\r\ninto this shape and that.\r\n\r\nWhere did they come from? Or, judging from their "talk," _when_ did\r\nthey come from? And would it do me any good if I knew?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI was sitting there in my bachelor apartment, drinking a can of\r\nbeer and trying to work a crossword puzzle to get sleepy. I wasn\'t\r\nespecially jittery like the groom is always supposed to be on the eve\r\nof his wedding. Just wide awake at midnight, wanting to get sleepy so I\r\ncould get some real rest when I went to bed.\r\n\r\nJust sitting there trying to think of a two-letter word for "sun-god."\r\nAnd that made me think of the gold in Betty\'s hair when the sun was on\r\nit at the beach. And pretty soon I was just staring into space, aching\r\nfor Betty, wishing the next twelve hours of my life would vanish and we\r\ncould be together, heading for our little cottage at the lake.\r\n\r\nStaring into space.... Then it wasn\'t just space. There were these two\r\nbig ball bearings in front of me, about three feet in diameter, if you\r\ncould say they had a diameter. They looked like ball bearings because\r\ntheir surfaces were shiny, mirrorlike steel. But they had unevenly\r\nspaced, smooth bumps. Something like the random knobs on a potato, so\r\nthey weren\'t really round at all.\r\n\r\nThe light from my lamp reflected crazily, and my own image gaped back\r\nat me from their distorted, reflecting curves. Like the fun-mirrors at\r\nthe crazy-house, only crazier ... and not funny at all. Fear is never\r\nfunny. And I was afraid. I\'ll swear I could _taste_ the terror. It was\r\nsalty on my tongue. When I tried to cry out, the roof of my mouth felt\r\nlike old concrete.\r\n\r\nThen one of them spoke. "It\'s alive! Intelligent! It senses our\r\npresence!"\r\n\r\nI was receiving pure thought, not words. But man thinks only in words.\r\nAnd their thoughts fished suitable words from my subconscious to frame\r\nthem for my assimilation.\r\n\r\nTelepathy? Impossible! What common points of reference could I have\r\nwith these two unthinkably alien life-forms?\r\n\r\nThe answer whipped back at me on an intuitive, sub-vocal level: Thought\r\nis a universal energy manifestation. _Language is only the clumsy\r\nvehicle for thought._\r\n\r\nBetween me and the aliens lay no such barrier.\r\n\r\n"Obviously intelligent," the other agreed. "Feel those gamma\r\nradiations? Too bad they\'re so weak. It would be interesting if he\r\ncould communicate with us."\r\n\r\nI stammered aloud, "But--but I _can_ communicate with you. I understand\r\nevery--"\r\n\r\nThey were paying no attention to my raspy words. "Yes, that\'s typical\r\nof these ancient, organic life-forms. As I recall, they use some form\r\nof physical vibration of their gaseous medium for communicating among\r\nthemselves--"\r\n\r\n"Speaking of which," the other interrupted, "this particular gaseous\r\nmedium seems to contain oxygen. We\'d best not remain overlong or we\'ll\r\ncorrode and catch hell when we return.

"\r\n\r\n"Exude a little nickel if it irritates you. We\'ll catch hell anyway\r\nwhen mother--"\r\n\r\nYes, that\'s the word that came to me!\r\n\r\n"--discovers _when_ we\'ve been. I\'m curious about these flesh and blood\r\ncreatures. I wonder who invented this clumsy monstrosity."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe meant me. 

He rolled a foot nearer, and the other followed with an\r\nuncertain wobble. "I turned out better in the third grade."\r\n\r\n"Liar! You nearly flunked meta-plastics."\r\n\r\n"Well, you did flunk it, so who are you to--?"\r\n\r\n"Just don\'t be over-critical. I think this one looks fairly practical.\r\nWell-balanced--"\r\n\r\n"That\'s just what I mean. Observe the unimaginative bisymmetry. Two\r\narms, two legs, two eyes, five fingers on each hand, five toes on each\r\nfoot. Surely, the inventor was a mechanic and no artist. In this light\r\ngravity there was no need for--"\r\n\r\n"And how would you improve the design, your high-and-mightiness?

"\r\n\r\n"First let\'s remove the covering."\r\n\r\nMy clothes left my body gently, but with the sound of violent tearing.\r\nIn two seconds I sat naked, my garments laid back like split bandages.\r\n\r\nI shouted, "See here, for God\'s sakes!"\r\n\r\nThe aliens had made no visible move, yet they had wielded powerful\r\nforces to strip everything I wore from my body, shirt, slacks,\r\nunderwear and even my shoes ... without so much as pinching my flesh.\r\n\r\nI leaped to my feet naked as a straw. They were between me and the\r\ndoor, but they seemed so clumsy.\r\n\r\n"Watch it! 

He\'s alarmed. Don\'t let him escape!"\r\n\r\n"Try and stop me!" I screamed, tensing my muscles for a leap over the\r\npair of intruders. Suddenly the air about my sweating body seemed to\r\nthicken to the viscosity of molasses. I could breathe it all right, but\r\nquick motion was denied me. My grand leap died before my right foot\r\nleft the floor. I retreated to my chair in slow-motion panic, sinking\r\nslowly through the clabbered atmosphere, to a sitting position on my\r\ntorn clothing.\r\n\r\n"Yes, a very clumsy, unesthetic life-form. In fact the bisymmetry\r\nfairly nauseates me. Granted that the two arms are practical, doubtless\r\none or the other does 90% of all work. So why have them of equal\r\nimportance? See here, I\'ll demonstrate...."\r\n\r\n"Wait!" 

the other cautioned. "This is a sentient creature. You can\'t\r\noperate without...."\r\n\r\n"Of course not!"\r\n\r\nSomething buzzed in my spine, and I blanked out. For the space of one\r\nbreath, it seemed.\r\n\r\n"There, that\'s better."\r\n\r\n"I guess I must agree with you."\r\n\r\nA faint tingle in my left arm caused me to stare at it. Unbelievingly!\r\nIts length was the same, but its diameter was reduced to two-thirds,\r\nand there were two fingers missing on the hand. The opposable thumb\r\nremained, but it now had more the appearance of a claw than a human\r\nhand. I tried to scream, but the sound was a glutinous bubble of air\r\nthat never reached my lips.\r\n\r\n"How about the pedal appendages?"\r\n\r\n"Well--" there was some hesitation. "Considering the method of\r\nlocomotion, bisymmetry seems more justified there. However, why\r\nbilateral? Why not quadrilateral?"\r\n\r\n"Because the organs of sight face only one way.

"\r\n\r\n"I can fix that, too."\r\n\r\nMy spine buzzed, and when I looked down again a flood of peculiar\r\nchanges had taken place. My ankles terminated in the middle of my feet,\r\nand my heels had disappeared. In their place were toes.\r\n\r\n"You see, with the double-hinged knee-joint, he can travel forward or\r\nbackward now without pivoting...."\r\n\r\nThen I became aware that I could _look_ forward and backward at the\r\nsame time.\r\n\r\n"That thing in the middle is certainly superfluous."\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nBuzz!\r\n\r\nIt was gone.\r\n\r\n"A tentacle fastened, say, to the right hip-bone could be very useful."\r\n\r\nBuzz!\r\n\r\nMy right hip tingled. From it protruded a whip-like appendage some\r\neight feet long, brown and leathery, tapering to the diameter of a\r\npencil and terminating in a pink flesh-pad richly supplied with sensory\r\nbuds. I could feel every hair in the nap of the carpet on which it\r\nrested--feel, taste, smell and hear! Four sense organs in one!\r\n\r\n"Now we are making progress!" came the exclamation.\r\n\r\nBuzz! 

Buzz! Buzz!\r\n\r\nThe instant-seeming anesthetic moments came upon me in quick\r\nsuccession, and each left me bereft of some standard, human equipment\r\nor in the possession of some extra-normal addition to my anatomy--with\r\nno more sensation than the slight tingle I have mentioned.\r\n\r\nFrom their mental remarks I conclude that I lost my vermiform appendix,\r\ntonsils and a mole on my left shoulder blade. Most of the other items\r\nwhich I acquired were too grotesque to describe further.\r\n\r\n"The two additional cardiac structures and the adrenal adjustments\r\nshould assure some likelihood of immortality," one of the intruders was\r\nexplaining.\r\n\r\n"Which would probably bring about over-population in ten generations,"\r\nthe other reminded him.\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes. I should compensate for that.

"\r\n\r\nBuzz, and he did!\r\n\r\n"I\'m corroding."\r\n\r\n"Exude some chrome as I told you."\r\n\r\n"I think I hear mother calling, anyway. Let\'s go before she--"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey were too late. A third bumpy ball-bearing materialized behind the\r\ntwo aliens, and instantly a barrage of maternal scolding dominated the\r\nether. "I\'ve been searching the whole continuum for you two! What are\r\nyou doing back here?"\r\n\r\n"We were just about to return, Mother."\r\n\r\n"That\'s the truth, Mother. We just broke through here so we could\r\npractice our advanced--"\r\n\r\n"Practice!" Mother exclaimed. "Practice on this poor, primitive,\r\norganic creature?"\r\n\r\nI felt poor and primitive indeed. Paralyzed with fear, my only wonder\r\nnow was that apparently I had retained my sanity throughout this\r\nwaking nightmare.\r\n\r\n"We didn\'t hurt him."\r\n\r\n"You put him back the way you found him, do you understand? Do it right\r\nthis instant!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mother. Let\'s see, how _did_ we find him?"\r\n\r\n"Simple bilateral symmetry, stupid!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, two of everything except--"\r\n\r\n"Hold it! Remember the anaesthesia."\r\n\r\nBuzz!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen I awakened this time they were gone. My electric clock hummed\r\nsoftly on the mantle, revealing the nonsensical information that less\r\nthan an hour had passed since my visitors first arrived.\r\n\r\nI staggered to my feet, bracing myself against the thick air, but the\r\nair was just ordinary, thin, substanceless air again. My hand dropped\r\nto my right hip.\r\n\r\nThe tentacle was gone.\r\n\r\n"Thank God!" I breathed, and for an instant my common sense tried to\r\ninsist that I had merely fallen asleep for a few minutes and dreamed\r\nthe whole fantastic sequence.\r\n\r\nBut no! Why would I be stark naked? And why were my clothes lying\r\nruined in my chair like bandages split with a huge razor?\r\n\r\nI clenched my left fist and gained comfort from the reassuring pressure\r\nof four fingers and a thumb in my palm. But then I stepped into my\r\nbedroom and stood before my full-length mirror--where I have stood\r\nrooted ever since.\r\n\r\nAnd the question revolves in my brain, punctuated only by my profanity\r\nand sobs of despair. How can I marry Betty now? How can I face her, let\r\nalone marry her?\r\n\r\nWhat woman on earth could bring herself to marry a man with no\r\nnavel ... and two heads?\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


"\r\n\r\n"You mean, you cook?" He stared in awe.\r\n\r\n"I\'m making a cake," she breathed, inching closer.\r\n\r\nHe backed out of the doorway and she entered. Without giving him\r\nanother glance, she went to the pneumatic, cut in the phone and ordered\r\na pound of sugar. She turned back to him.\r\n\r\n"It shouldn\'t be a minute. I\'ll wait--if you don\'t mind."\r\n\r\nHe had tried to keep himself from studying her. Despite this, his\r\neyes told him that her figure was just about perfect and as both a\r\ncounteraction and a stimulant to the mounting tension in him, her smile\r\nwas surprisingly bright and full. There was little danger of the flavor\r\nof her warpaint confusing a man. She wore little, if any. Her bright\r\nlips and cheeks seemed to need no added color.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t bother to stand," she said considerately. She waited until he\r\nhad lowered himself to the couch, then dropped down beside him, a\r\ntrifle too close to allow him to put his mind on other things.\r\n\r\n"I hope I haven\'t troubled you." Her hand brushed his.\r\n\r\n"Not at all." He drew his hand away.\r\n\r\n"From the looks of your side-board," she went on cheerily, "you were\r\njust getting ready to mix a drink. I\'m an expert. Shall I mix a couple?"\r\n\r\nHe resisted the inclination to rise when she did, and deliberately kept\r\nhis eyes from following her. He snatched up the paper, rustled it\r\nnoisily and tried to concentrate on the headlines.\r\n\r\nTwo things distracted him. One was the faint scent of perfume and the\r\nother was the chinking of ice and glasses. He put the paper aside,\r\ntried to put his mind on distant things. 

This soon palled. He was about\r\nto get up and pace the floor when she returned and handed him a cool\r\nglass.\r\n\r\n"Thanks," he said and leaned back.\r\n\r\nShe sat down again, so close that her shoulder brushed his. He\r\nedged over against the arm of the couch, putting an inch of space\r\nbetween them, glanced sidelong at her, and drank. He rolled his eyes\r\nceiling-ward, smacked his lips and drank again.\r\n\r\n"What did you put in it?"\r\n\r\n"About a spoonful of creme de menthe, a couple drops of bitters and\r\nabout two ounces of rye. Like it?"\r\n\r\nHe scowled deliberately, armoring himself against his feelings. "It\'s\r\nfair--for a woman\'s mixings. You should have put in more liquor."\r\n\r\n"Of course. 

I\'ll learn."\r\n\r\n"Not from me," he snapped. "I\'m a woman-hater."\r\n\r\nShe leaned toward him. 

"Why?"\r\n\r\nHe tossed off the balance of the drink, set the glass on the table and\r\nmade a sweeping gesture. "They\'re all alike," he said brutally. "Fickle\r\nand treacherous. Deceivers. Always flinging their sex around."\r\n\r\n"Not all women," she countered. "Take this Professor Madigan who\r\ndiscovered that new adhesion force."\r\n\r\n"A woman?"\r\n\r\n"Of course. Professor Madigan is a scholarly young woman. Her sex\r\nappeal might not win a beauty contest, but she discovered a perfectly\r\nwonderful man-catcher."\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"A new force. Works like gravity--only it\'s different. Its strength\r\nincreases in ratio to the square of the distance."\r\n\r\n"What are you talking about? Women don\'t understand things like that."\r\n\r\n"No?"\r\n\r\n"No! Need I spell it out for you? Your delivery should be in the\r\npneumatic by now. Why don\'t you pick it up and go home and make your\r\ncake?"\r\n\r\n"I shall. I had no idea I was living next door to a misogynist, and a\r\nbrutal one at that."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like women," Kerran said emphatically. "They\'re all alike.\r\nFickle. Deceivers. Everything about them artificial. Lips, color,\r\nshape."\r\n\r\nThe girl rose and stood over him. "I\'m not wearing make-up," she\r\nasserted. "You flatter yourself in thinking I would put on my face to\r\ncome across the hall."\r\n\r\n"Your shape! Your hips aren\'t that neat!"\r\n\r\nThe color rose in her cheeks. She lifted a hand as though to strike\r\nhim. The hand trembled. She lowered it to her side. "I do not wear a\r\ngirdle. Want to feel?"\r\n\r\n"No," he said, his own color rising. 

"Go on home."\r\n\r\nIgnoring the pneumatic, she crossed to the door, snatched it open,\r\nmarched into the corridor. Through the open doorway he heard the knob\r\nturn on her door. He went to the pneumatic, picked up the sugar, strode\r\nacross the corridor and knocked. In a moment her head appeared, then\r\nthe door swung wide.\r\n\r\n"You forgot something," he said contritely. "Sorry I was rude. I\'m\r\na natural woman-hater, and a moment before you came in some wench\r\non television triggered my feelings on the subject.... Just keep on\r\nyour own side of the fence and I\'ll stay on mine. I\'ll even speak\r\nto you occasionally, if you wish, but that\'s as far as I\'ll go in\r\nneighborliness."\r\n\r\n"Thanks," she said. "You\'re more than kind. But I shan\'t trouble you.\r\nI\'ve just become a man-hater."\r\n\r\nKerran turned to go. Halfway across the corridor he felt something tug\r\nat him. It was a steady and increasingly powerful pull, forcing him\r\ninto the girl\'s apartment. He lost his balance, reeled through the\r\ndoorway, came to a halt against the table, noticed that the force still\r\ndrew him toward the girl on the far side of the table.\r\n\r\n"Well?" she said.\r\n\r\n"Er-uh, just dropped in. 

Going right back out."\r\n\r\nHe got halfway to the door before it again took effect. He leaned\r\nagainst it, dug his feet into the carpet, pushed. He almost reached the\r\ndoor. He could go no farther, knew he was going to be snatched back to\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\nHe turned, dug in his heels, braced himself, and then the girl came\r\nflying over the table and directly into his arms. Instantly the force\r\nreleased him and he fell with the girl on top.\r\n\r\nThe platinum hair was in his eyes, against his face, the scent of\r\nperfume all about, the full weight of the soft warm flesh pressing him\r\ndown. Then she struggled up, stood erect.\r\n\r\nGetting his feet under him, he said, "I want to apologize. Your shape\r\nis natural. You don\'t wear a girdle. And now I\'ll be going.

"\r\n\r\nHe had scarcely turned before he felt it again. He swung back quickly,\r\nsaw that the girl was hanging on the sofa. He lost his balance, went\r\nstaggering toward her, flung out his arms, and the next thing he knew\r\nshe was pressing against him, standing on her toes, and her lips were\r\nbrushing his cheek, and they were moist and warm and soft.\r\n\r\nShe drew back and said, belligerently, "I wish you\'d get out of here."\r\n\r\nHe started again, hesitated when he felt the force, turned back. "I\'ve\r\nheard of magnetic women," he said with restraint. "I never believed in\r\nit. But now--" He gestured vaguely. "Please turn off your charms."\r\n\r\nShe lowered her eyes. "I thought it was you. I\'ve been drawn to you\r\nfrom the first and I thought you\'d suddenly become irresistible. Do you\r\nmean you feel it too?"\r\n\r\nHe nodded. "I\'ve read about magnetic women in the best books. Now, dash\r\nit, turn it off! I\'m getting tired of hanging around here."\r\n\r\n"It\'s you," she insisted. "You turn it off."\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. "I\'m plain as an old shoe. 

Everybody knows. But you!\r\nOne look at you and anybody\'d know you\'ve got this magnetism. That\'s\r\nwhy I had to be so brutal. It was the only way I could resist and keep\r\nmy woman-hating integrity. I can feel your magnetism now. It\'s getting\r\nstronger."\r\n\r\n"And I feel yours. It\'s pulling me right into your arms."\r\n\r\n"Stay back. I can\'t stand much more. I\'m a confirmed misogynist, and if\r\nyou keep on I\'ll have to go against my principles, and that wouldn\'t be\r\nhonest."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t help it," she murmured from two feet away. "I can\'t resist\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nKerran puzzled briefly. "Maybe that\'s it. I remember when I was\r\noverseas. 

But no! All they wanted was chewing gum and cigarets. Still,\r\nyou never can tell. 

Maybe it came on me suddenly. Maybe looking at you\r\nsort of triggered my magnetism."\r\n\r\nShe smiled. "If you\'ll quit looking at me maybe we can stop it. Look\r\nthe other way and I\'ll try to stop thinking about you because you do\r\nsomething to me."\r\n\r\nKerran nodded. "That\'s it. 

Beat it! 

I\'ll put my mind on something else."\r\n\r\nVisualizing a horse race in which he had his money on the bang-tail\r\njust ready to break the tape, he didn\'t feel the tug for several\r\nseconds. He struggled mightily but futilely to resist. He wound up in\r\nthe kitchen where the girl was holding onto the electric range.\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t play fair," he said accusingly. "Treacherous. 

Just like\r\nall your sex. You thought about me."\r\n\r\nShe lowered her eyes. "I--I just couldn\'t help it."\r\n\r\nKerran felt his chest expand involuntarily. "One of us is\r\nirresistible," he said. "It isn\'t you because I positively was not\r\nthinking about you. So it must be me." His chest expanded another inch.\r\n"I guess a girl who can\'t resist me would be true. And since we can\'t\r\nbeat this force, the only solution is to get married."\r\n\r\nShe nodded. "That\'s the only solution. But maybe I don\'t want to solve\r\nthe problem. 

You\'ll have to persuade me."\r\n\r\nThe voice from the television in the living room was barely audible in\r\nthe kitchen: "The new force was originally developed for the purpose\r\nof drawing troops into a compact group so they could be atom-bombed.\r\nProfessor Madigan refused to disclose its secret to be used for that\r\npurpose. She pointed out that it had a far more useful potential. A\r\nfield of it, built into a woman\'s garments, enables her to attract at\r\na distance the man of her choice. She can control this with a switch\r\nconveniently located in a pocket. 

Her own charms do the rest."\r\n\r\nKerran ignored the telecast. She was in his arms and he had his face\r\nhalf-buried in her silken hair. "I don\'t even know your name ..." he\r\nlaughed embarrassedly.\r\n\r\nHer voice was low and soft as she murmured, "Madigan--Joyce Madigan."\r\n\r\nHe stiffened suddenly. "You mean you\'re _Professor_ Madigan--"\r\n\r\nShe snuggled closer against him and somehow it didn\'t really seem to\r\nmatter now what her name was. "Let\'s say I _was_ Professor Madigan--a\r\nwoman\'s place is in the home, don\'t you agree?"\r\n\r\nAfter a few emphatic kisses he did.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


Something was haywire in the fuel system of his\r\nInterstar Runabout. 

He was losing altitude fast, so fast that all five\r\npairs of his eyes couldn\'t focus on a place to land.\r\n\r\nFive pairs of arms, each pair about three feet apart on the loglike\r\nbody, pushed buttons and rotated controls frantically, but to no avail.\r\nIn a few short minutes it would all be over for Probos Five. Even if by\r\nsome miracle he remained unhurt after crashing, he would die shortly\r\nthereafter. The frigid climatic conditions of the third planet were\r\ndeadly to a Mercurian. He thought once of donning his space suit but\r\ndecided against it. 

That would merely prolong the agony. From Planet\r\nThree, when one has a smashed space cruiser, there is no return. Probos\r\nFive knew that death was riding with him in the helpless ship. The\r\nsituation did not unnecessarily dismay him; Mercurians are philosophers.\r\n\r\nProbos Five ceased to manipulate the unresponding controls. Stretching\r\nhis trunklike torso to its full twenty feet, four heads gazed through\r\nobservation ports at the four points of the compass while the remaining\r\nhead desultorily watched the instrument panel.\r\n\r\nSince die he must, Probos Five would meet his end stoically, and five\r\npairs of stumpy arms folded over five chests in a coordinated gesture of\r\nresignation.\r\n\r\nProbos Five thought fleetingly of his wife Lingua Four and remembered\r\nwith some annoyance that she was the author of his present predicament.\r\nA social climber, Probos Five thought to himself, but aside from that a\r\ngood wife and mother in addition to being a reigning beauty. Lingua Four\r\nwas tall even for a Mercurian. Already she scaled seven dergs, or in\r\nEarth terms, fourteen feet and was beginning to show evidences of a\r\nfifth head. Five heads were rarely found on females and Probos Five was\r\njustly proud of his good fortune. In all Mercury at the present time, he\r\nknew of but two females possessing five heads and soon Lingua Four would\r\nbe the third of her sex to be thus endowed.\r\n\r\nYes, thought Probos Five, a woman to be proud of; for today after three\r\nvargs of marriage the memory of her trim trunk with four pairs of eyes\r\nlaughing mischievously, filled his five brains with flame. Slim as a\r\nbirch she stood in his memory, and eight eyes whispered lovers\' thoughts\r\nacross space and time.\r\n\r\nProbos Five recalled his five minds from their nostalgic reverie and\r\ngazed at the contour of the Earth that was rushing up to meet him.\r\nWhite, blazing white reflecting the rays of the midnight sun covered the\r\nregion as far as the eye could reach.\r\n\r\n"Good," thought Probos Five, "the Polar regions. That means the end will\r\ncome quickly. One or two seconds at the most of that bitter cold would\r\nbe enough."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTurning away from the windows Probos Five let his thoughts return to\r\nLingua Four, to Probos Two, his son, and his home on the first planet\r\nfrom the sun. Ah, that is the place to live, thought Probos, the\r\ntemperature an unchanging 327\xc2\xb0; just comfortably warm, where one could\r\nenjoy a life of warmth and ease. Too bad that he would not live to see\r\nit again. 

Thirty vargs, he reflected, is such a short time. With luck,\r\nperhaps he may have lived to see a hundred vargs slip by. And perhaps in\r\ntime he may have added three more heads and five dergs in length to his\r\ntowering trunk.\r\n\r\nHe thought of Probos Two and wondered idly if his son would also visit\r\nthe barbarian worlds to collect data for Lingua Four.\r\n\r\nHe wished that he could have seen more of Probos Two. There\'s an\r\nup-and-coming lad, he thought, not quite two vargs old and two heads\r\nalready. Yes, indeed, he\'s quite a boy, Probos Five remembered proudly;\r\nmaybe his mother will keep him at home instead of running him all over\r\nthe universe to get material for her committees.\r\n\r\nHe wished that Lingua Four would settle down and be content as a\r\nhousewife, but he doubted that she would. Social ambition was boring\r\nlike a termite under her bark.\r\n\r\nLingua Four was determined to be the first lady of Arbor, the capital\r\ncity of Mercury. To this end Lingua Four had labored unceasingly. She\r\nwas president of half the women\'s clubs of Arbor. She could always be\r\ndepended upon to furnish the best in new and diverting subjects.\r\n\r\nShe headed almost all committees for aid or research on any type of\r\nproblem. It was owing to Lingua Four being president of the Committee\r\nfor Undernourished Arborians that Probos Five was making this\r\nill-starred trip. His purpose was to capture a few of the upright,\r\ndivided trunk animals that inhabited the third planet.\r\n\r\nThey were to be transported to Mercury and given over to scientific\r\nstudy as to their edible qualities. If it were found that the divided\r\ntrunk creatures were fit for Mercurian consumption, the problem of\r\nundernourishment would no longer exist since the supply of divided\r\ntrunks was seemingly inexhaustible. Mercurians had made expeditions to\r\nthe third planet before and every report concluded with--"Divided trunk\r\ncreatures increasing in number."\r\n\r\nPrivately Probos Five doubted the possibility of using the divided\r\ntrunks for food, since the last expedition once again reported a\r\ncomplete lack of captives due to the frail and tenuous bodies of the\r\ndivided trunks. Then, too, transportation and preservation posed a\r\ntremendous problem, not to mention the difficulty of trying to eat\r\nsomething that might vaporize on your fork. But then these questions may\r\nnever arise, he decided, for of all the reports perused by Probos Five\r\nnot one expedition had succeeded in bringing a divided trunk to Mercury.\r\n\r\nAll reports were read to the last letter by Probos Five before\r\nassembling equipment for his own trip. In the reports he had noted many\r\nof the difficulties of the earlier missions. Planet Three was impossible\r\nfor a Mercurian without a heated space suit. The temperature of Planet\r\nThree was so low that it would literally freeze a Mercurian stiff in a\r\nmatter of seconds.\r\n\r\nThe casualties of the early expeditions had been numerous. Many\r\nMercurians had succumbed to the bitter cold due to flaws in space suits\r\nand other accidents. A break in the suit meant instant death. The\r\nvictims of such mishaps were invariably buried in the isolated, sparsely\r\ninhabited Polar regions to avoid alarming the divided trunk creatures.\r\n\r\nIt was strange, mused Probos Five, that the divided trunks were\r\nseemingly unable to bear the slightest increase in temperature. Their\r\nbodies disintegrated upon contact with a Mercurian. Some were roped and\r\ndragged from a distance up to the doors of the space ships, but no\r\ninhabitant of Planet Three had been closer to Mercury than the air lock\r\nof the space cruisers. As the divided trunk people were dragged into the\r\nair lock, warm air from the ship would be pumped into the lock to dispel\r\nthe frigid air of Planet Three. As the warmth of Mercury enveloped the\r\ndivided trunks they became quite red, began to melt and finally\r\ndissolved into a gaseous state, leaving a small pile of ashes and a\r\ndisagreeable odor in the air lock that sometimes lingered for days.\r\n\r\nProbos Five believed he had the solution for these obstacles in the path\r\nof scientific study of the divided trunks. He had decided to use guile\r\nin place of strength. 

For this reason he had come alone and in a small\r\nspace runabout to put his solution to the test. But his solution now\r\ncould never be tried, he remembered morosely.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the aft compartment Probos Five had constructed a refrigeration\r\nplant. By maintaining a constant degree of frigidity he hoped to deliver\r\na pair of each species of divided trunks to Mercury. He hoped especially\r\nto capture a complete set and perhaps a few over to make up for breakage\r\nand losses. As to what form of sustenance the divided trunks were\r\naccustomed to, he had no idea whatsoever. He had intended to bring\r\nsamples of earth, vegetation and anything else that may have suggested a\r\nsource of food for the divided trunks.\r\n\r\nThe thought too had occurred to him that possibly the divided trunk\r\ncreatures ate one another. On the possibility of this Probos Five had\r\ndetermined to capture three black ones, three white ones, three yellows,\r\nthree browns and three reds, and three of any other color that he might\r\nfind. He rather doubted that more colors or combination of colors\r\nexisted. All previous expedition reports had mentioned only the five\r\ncolors. However, Probos Five had determined to keep several eyes open on\r\nthe off chance that he might find a new and different species.\r\n\r\nHis refrigerator was modeled along the architectural lines of the dens\r\nof the divided trunks. The main room of the refrigerator opened to the\r\noutside of the ship by means of a small air lock. A Mercurian size air\r\nlock was not needed for the divided trunks, as few had been found to be\r\nmuch over three dergs in height.\r\n\r\nWinches and cables to pull the divided trunks into the refrigerator were\r\ninstalled in the refrigerator room itself to avoid burning the divided\r\ntrunks with hot cables from other parts of the ship.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Probos Five had cunningly devised a refrigerated trap. This\r\ntoo was designed to simulate the caves of the divided trunk creatures\r\nbut was smaller. It was constructed with entrances readily seen and\r\nexits well hidden. 

Probos Five had expected great things of his trap. He\r\nhad conceived the idea after reading the report of a Mercurian\r\nexpedition that explored the dens of the divided trunks at some place\r\nmarked "Coney Island." According to the reports the divided trunks\r\nshowed no hesitancy in entering these types of dens. In fact, the writer\r\nof the report gave it as his opinion that the divided ones perhaps\r\nplayed games in these types of caves. It also mentioned that some of the\r\ndens were equipped with flat shiny surfaces that cast reflections or\r\nimages. Probos Five had incorporated the image-making surfaces into his\r\ntrap design. A pity that all this effort must be wasted, thought Probos\r\nas he once more turned to the observation ports to check his remaining\r\ndistance from the planet\'s surface. Seeing that his time was short,\r\nProbos Five turned all five faces forward in the Mercurian gesture of\r\ndisdain for death. A moment later came the shock.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA week later the proprietor of a novelty shop in Fairbanks watched two\r\nnatives with their dog team pulling something loglike through the snow\r\ntoward the trading post. Turning to a customer he remarked,\r\n\r\n"Here comes Ketch and Ah Koo dragging in another Totem Pole. Guess that\r\nKetch must be the biggest liar ever produced by the Eskimos. He tried to\r\ntell me that Totem Poles fall from the sky. Says he can always find one\r\nif he sees it fall because it\'s so hot it melts the snow around it.\r\nPersonally I think he should be elected president of the Liars\' Club,\r\nbut I\'ll buy the Totem Pole anyway. Those pesky tourists always whittle\r\na chunk out of my Totem Pole for a souvenir.\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad he\'s bringing me another one," the storekeeper concluded, "the\r\none he sold me last year is about whittled away."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Planet Stories_ January 1954.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

"\r\n\r\nI nodded. "Yep. 

Got \'em right here." I unfolded them and handed them\r\nover to him.\r\n\r\nHe ran his eyes over them quizzically. "Hokay," he said. "I guess we go\r\nto Aldebaran, huh?"\r\n\r\nOur instructions came in detail a little while later. We were to hover\r\nover Aldebaran VII and give a special signal; a transfer-tug would come\r\nup to us from the surface and hand the Ambassador and his pet over to\r\nus. Under no conditions were we to land on Aldebaran VII itself; the\r\nnatives would regard it as a breach of the truce that currently existed\r\nbetween their world and ours.\r\n\r\nOkay, I thought. I didn\'t care.\r\n\r\nI gave the orders to the crew at nightfall and we left Earth a little\r\npast midnight. Meersal had already instructed the astrogator about our\r\nnext destination and he had whipped up the course.\r\n\r\nWe did some hundred thousand miles on ion-drive and then, safely clear\r\nof the Earth\'s grav-field, converted over and popped into warp.\r\nAldebaran lay three weeks ahead of us through hyperspace.\r\n\r\nEarth and Aldebaran had first contact about 10 years before. I didn\'t\r\nknow anything particular about the planet or its people--there are\r\nenough worlds in the galaxy so you don\'t get to know each type of\r\nalien there is. We had a special cabin ready aboard the ship for the\r\nAldebaranian ambassador and his pet. Instructions told us to prepare a\r\nspecial fluorine atmosphere, which meant the Aldebaranians couldn\'t be\r\nmuch like us.\r\n\r\nBut they had agreed to negotiate a treaty of friendship with Earth and\r\nwere sending an ambassador. That was good news, I thought.\r\n\r\nWe popped out of warp right on schedule and there was the giant hazy\r\nred sun that was Aldebaran, staring us right in the face. It seemed to\r\nfill the entire sky.\r\n\r\nOur astrogator plotted a course rapidly for Aldebaran VII, which was\r\nthen at perihelion and a good ways across the heavens from where we\r\nwere. The Aldebaran system is a huge one--31 planets spread out over\r\nsix or seven billion miles of space.\r\n\r\nMost of them were dead worlds, though. It was only Aldebaran VII that\r\nhad any sort of intelligent life, or so our survey teams reported.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt took three days more to get within hailing distance of the seventh\r\nplanet. It spun beneath us, a pretty blue-green ball about the size of\r\nEarth.\r\n\r\nWe came within about a million miles and set up an orbit as per\r\ninstructions. No sooner had we done that than we found ourselves\r\nsurrounded by a flock of alien warships.\r\n\r\nI went to the radio room and made contact.\r\n\r\n"State name and object here," I was ordered in a crisp, business-like\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n"I\'m Johnny Martin, Captain of the Terran vessel 13-XV-1, with no\r\nhostile intent. We\'re here to pick up an ambassador from Aldebaran to\r\nEarth, along with his pet."\r\n\r\nI heard some hasty conferring going on and then someone said, "Hold on,\r\nTerran ship. 

We\'ll check with the home planet."\r\n\r\nFive tense minutes passed--minutes in which I half expected to be\r\nblown out of the sky by a sudden attack. You never can tell with\r\naliens. They\'re likely to do almost anything; their psychologies are\r\nunpredictable in Terran terms--as, I guess, ours are in theirs.\r\n\r\nBut finally my receiver crackled and the alien voice said, "Everything\r\nis clear, 13-XV-1. Remain in orbit and ambassador will be transferred\r\nto your ship. Any suspicious move on your part will bring immediate\r\nattack by our defense fleet."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t worry. I\'m not going any place. 

I\'ll wait right here."\r\n\r\nI watched in the viewscope as a small ship bellied upward from the\r\nblue-green world below and approached us. They matched velocities with\r\nus, airlock to airlock.\r\n\r\n"Get that fluorine room ready," I ordered my men. "The Ambassador\'s\r\ncoming aboard."\r\n\r\nThe two ships hung side by side in space. Of course, there was no\r\napparent relative motion since we had the same velocity. It was\r\npossible to walk back and forth from their ship to ours.\r\n\r\n"Prepare to receive Ambassador," came the message from the other ship.\r\n"His excellency, Quelf Tharkol, Minister Plenipotenitiary--and his pet."\r\n\r\n"I\'m ready," I said. "Our airlock\'s open."\r\n\r\nSlowly the lock of the other ship slid back and two space-suited\r\nfigures appeared--the Ambassador, Quelf Tharkol, and his pet. The\r\nAmbassador was invisible within his spacesuit but he stood upright and\r\nlooked to be about the size of a man. I was happy about that; it\'s\r\nalways a lot easier to negotiate with a humanoids-type alien than with\r\nsomething totally bizarre.\r\n\r\nI chuckled when I saw the space-suited cat--for so I thought of it.\r\nIt was cat-size, in a little form-fitting spacesuit, and it scampered\r\nafter its master on four legs, space-suited tail wagging behind. It was\r\nsort of a cute little thing, I thought; no wonder its master didn\'t\r\ncare to leave it behind.\r\n\r\n"Everything all set?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Transfer is completed," said the captain of the other ship. He closed\r\nhis lock, and pulled away from us.\r\n\r\n"Close the lock!" 

I ordered.\r\n\r\nI gestured to a crewman standing by. "Show the Ambassador to his room,"\r\nI said.\r\n\r\nWhen the Ambassador and his pet were in their special fluorinated\r\nstateroom I called them on the special television hookup I had set up\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nThey had taken their spacesuits off and were lying sprawled out in\r\ntheir green murky atmosphere, the Ambassador in his bunk and the pet\r\nin his. I could hardly see into the room over my circuit but I could\r\nsee that the Ambassador was very human and that the pet was pretty much\r\nlike a cat, except that he had sharp-clawed fingers instead of the soft\r\nlittle pads a cat has.\r\n\r\n"Everything all right in there?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Fine, just fine. How long will it take to get to Earth?"\r\n\r\n"About three weeks," I said. 

"We\'ll be going into warp any minute."\r\n\r\n"Very well," came the reply.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI didn\'t expect to have many dealings with the Ambassador. I had\r\nbeen told that he would have his own food supply and naturally he was\r\nconfined to his fluorinated stateroom. So we settled down to a pleasant\r\nreturn trip.\r\n\r\nBut on the second day of warp I was awakened from sweet dreams by\r\nWhitey Durbin, the Night Engineer. He shoved me around in my bunk until\r\nI opened one eye and said "Whatsamatter?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s the cat, Chief!"\r\n\r\n"Cat? What cat? You crazy, Whitey? 

Lemme go back to sleep."\r\n\r\nBut he was obstinate. "The Ambassador\'s pet. It\'s out of its room."\r\n\r\n"Huh? But it can\'t breathe--"\r\n\r\n"It\'s wearing a spacesuit. And it\'s wandering all over the ship,\r\nsnooping around. I caught it in the drive section and up front with the\r\ncharts. I don\'t like it, Chief."\r\n\r\n"No. Neither do I." 

I was wide awake all at once. There had been\r\nsomething fishy about this pet business all along and now I was\r\nsuspicious. Suppose the pet were a little smarter than a cat? Suppose\r\nit was snooping around innocently enough--and actually soaking up vital\r\nsecret information about the workings of a Terran spaceship?\r\n\r\nBut I didn\'t know what to do. My orders stressed the fact that I had to\r\nhandle the Ambassador with kid gloves--but on the other hand, was I\r\nsupposed to let that creature roam all over the ship?\r\n\r\n"Get me a hookup with Home Base," I said. "And in the meantime keep an\r\neye on that cat. Don\'t let it catch wise but try to follow it around.\r\nAnd _don\'t_ stop it from roaming. These aliens may be touchy about the\r\nfunniest things."\r\n\r\nI got in touch with Home Base in jig time. Commander Mahoney was the\r\nman I spoke to.\r\n\r\n"How\'s that Ambassador, Martin?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s why I\'m calling, sir. You see--the Ambassador\'s pet is creeping\r\nall around the ship. It\'s sort of a cat but I wonder whether maybe it\'s\r\ndoing a very neat job of spying on us."\r\n\r\n"Have you taken any action yet?"\r\n\r\n"No. I wanted to check with Home Base."\r\n\r\nMahoney thought for a moment. "I suppose it would be all right to\r\nspeak to the Ambassador about this and tactfully request that he keep\r\nthe creature in his own quarters. But be _tactful_ about it, Martin.\r\nRemember, we don\'t want to offend these aliens."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was the middle of the "night" aboard ship, so I didn\'t think it\r\nwould be particularly tactful to call the Ambassador just then.\r\n\r\nI waited until morning, by which time my men reported that the cat had\r\ncompleted its survey and had promptly returned to the Ambassador\'s room.\r\n\r\nWhen the television came on, the Ambassador and his pet were again\r\nreclining leisurely on their bunks.\r\n\r\n"Sorry if I\'m disturbing you," I said hesitantly.\r\n\r\n"That\'s quite all right. What can I do for you?"\r\n\r\n"A matter of shipboard procedure I\'d like to point out. It seems last\r\nnight your pet left your cabin and explored the ship, or so some of\r\nmy men reported. I\'d appreciate it if you\'d restrain the animal to\r\nquarters from now on. It upsets shipboard routine--and, besides, my\r\ninstructions request that I keep the operating sections of the ship\r\nunder security wrap."\r\n\r\nThere was silence for a moment. I held my breath, hoping I hadn\'t\r\nsaid something wrong, some thing that might foul up the delicate\r\nEarth-Aldebaran negotiations in progress.\r\n\r\nFinally came the reply. "I understand fully. I\'m sorry about the\r\nexploration trip--it was mere curiosity. It won\'t be repeated. 

But\r\nyou\'re mistaken about one thing.

"\r\n\r\n"What\'s that?" I asked somewhat puzzledly.\r\n\r\n"My pet remained in the cabin all night. _I_ was the one who explored\r\nthe ship." There was a sneer in his voice.\r\n\r\n"You? But--"\r\n\r\nMy mouth clammed shut. And then I understood. I couldn\'t keep the flush\r\nof embarrassment from my face and he saw it over the screen. It seemed\r\nto please him. 

Pretty damned clever, I thought. Smart psychology for\r\nthe aliens to bring a "human" as a pet, putting our diplomats on the\r\ndefensive right from the start. The Ambassador must have known what I\r\nwas thinking for the sneer grew on his face.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly I grinned. It seemed to surprise him. This, he hadn\'t\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\n"Captain, something strikes you as humorous?" There was uncertainty in\r\nhis tone. Plus a little annoyance.\r\n\r\nMy grin widened. "Just a little private joke, Ambassador," I said. I\r\nwas thinking that this joker was in for a shock. Two planets could play\r\nat this game and I would have plenty of time to tip off Home Base.\r\n\r\nAfter all, we have pets too....\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sign said: RIDE THE ROCKET! TWICE AROUND THE UNIVERSE FOR 25\xc2\xa2!\r\nWhich was cheap enough, Pete Moore thought. Cheap enough at twice the\r\nfare.\r\n\r\nGlory giggled and pulled at his arm. "Let\'s ride, Pete. 

Let\'s see what\r\nyou\'re in for."\r\n\r\nHe smiled down at her thinly, because it wasn\'t really anything for\r\nher to giggle about, but that was Glory for you. She was young enough,\r\ngay enough, to be able to make a joke of it, and that was good and he\r\nshouldn\'t spoil it. Not many other wives would feel like that. Not many\r\nother wives would want to spend his last night home on the midway, for\r\nthat matter. But then again, that was Glory.\r\n\r\nHe listened to the tinny carousel music and the babble of the crowd,\r\nthe laughter and the mingled drone of barkers. He smelled the tang\r\nof roasting popcorn and the hot-doggy stink of the lunchcounters. He\r\nlooked at the ferris wheel and the crazy swoop of lights that was the\r\nscenic railway and the people crowding along the boardwalk with kewpie\r\ndolls and spun-sugar candy cones in their hands.\r\n\r\nQuestion! his mind demanded: Is this reality?\r\n\r\nAnswer: Of course. What else?\r\n\r\nI\'ve been too long away from cities, he thought. Too many silent nights\r\nin the desert, too many high flights in cold blue air. Too long away\r\nfrom Glory?\r\n\r\nHe felt guilty and depressed at the thought. It wasn\'t the way for a\r\nman to feel. Not before the great adventure. Still, he couldn\'t avoid\r\nan almost homesick longing for the deep darkness of the desert and the\r\nsilver ship waiting there.\r\n\r\nSoon, he thought. Three days; three days and a few hours.\r\n\r\nHe felt a tug at his arm.\r\n\r\n"Pete!" Glory was smiling up at him, half-aggrieved, half-loving. He\r\nlooked again at the garishly painted sign.\r\n\r\nRIDE THE ROCKET!\r\n\r\n"Let\'s ride it, Pete," Glory said. "Let\'s!"\r\n\r\nThere was something in her smile that touched him. Pride? That, and\r\nlove and youth. To her, he was _the_ man. For her, and for all the\r\nworld. The one who was going to reach out beyond the far horizon and\r\ntouch the sky and bring back a pot of gold for everyone.\r\n\r\nShe thinks no one else could do it, he told himself. That\'s love. There\r\nwere a dozen qualified men, and yet--\r\n\r\nThe moonshot was his.\r\n\r\nRIDE THE ROCKET!\r\n\r\n"All right, baby," he said.\r\n\r\nAs he paid their fare for the rocket-ride, Pete found himself looking\r\nat the girl in the booth. Tired eyes and stringy hennaed hair. 

No\r\ndreams there. He had an impulse to tell her that soon he\'d really be\r\nriding the rocket and that from then on things would be different.\r\n\r\nNew frontiers and new dreams for everybody. Up and up.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe girl\'s eyes met his, and it was Pete who looked away. You don\'t\r\ntalk frontiers to pale, worn faces and eyes bleached of color by tinny\r\nmusic and stinks and men.\r\n\r\nThey walked up a wooden ramp to where a little metal bullet on rails\r\nwaited. The paint, once bright, was all scuffy. A sour-faced attendant\r\nin grayish coveralls stood by a large lever.\r\n\r\n"Fasten ya seat belts, Mac."\r\n\r\n"We\'re off to the sky," Glory said.\r\n\r\nSomewhere old machinery wheezed.\r\n\r\nThe little bullet began to move along the rails toward a hinged\r\ntrap-door in a wall painted to look like clouds.\r\n\r\n"Hold my hand, Pete," Glory said breathlessly.\r\n\r\nGlory, Glory, he thought. Young and simple and in love with life. 

Any\r\nkind of life. Real or unreal. Glory with a bubbling laughter, a zest, a\r\nfaith. Maybe it was really for her that he was taking the big flight.\r\nIf only he could bring back the pot of gold. If only he could tell\r\nweary Man that the sky was all his. 

He thought of the strained, unhappy\r\nfaces in the streets, the fear-filled eyes. If he could return and say\r\nto them: "Here\'s your new frontier!" Yes, by God, it was worth the\r\nwork, and the risk. 

Glory was right. It was something to be proud of.\r\n\r\nI\'m going to the moon!\r\n\r\nMe, Pete Moore, to the _moon_!\r\n\r\n"There it is, Pete!"\r\n\r\nThey had bumped through the painted door into a musty semi-darkness.\r\nThe walls were perforated with holes for stars, and from somewhere\r\nbelow a huge yellowish moon was rising.\r\n\r\nOff a short way to the right was a glowing papier-m\xc3\xa2ch\xc3\xa9 globe painted\r\nwith broad bands slightly askew, and behind that was another with rings.\r\n\r\nA loudspeaker whistled tinnily and overhead, on wire runners, an\r\nelectric globe crossed the dim chamber, pieces of yellow and white\r\ncrepe paper fluttering feebly behind.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Pete! A comet?"\r\n\r\n"Sure enough, Glory," he said.\r\n\r\nThe rumbling little bullet skirted the walls and Pete could see the\r\nelectric lights behind the holes. Stars, he thought sardonically. Close\r\nenough to touch. Lucky us.\r\n\r\n"There\'s Mars, Pete," Glory said, squeezing his hand.\r\n\r\nI\'m getting disenchanted, he thought.\r\n\r\nA red ball, all painted with canals and white polar caps far too big.\r\n\r\nThey should have had a technical advisor on this project, he thought.\r\nPaging Palomar.\r\n\r\nThe bullet began its second circuit of the papier-m\xc3\xa2ch\xc3\xa9 universe,\r\nand the moon was high now, projected on the wall by some kind of\r\nlantern-slide lamp. There was a face on the moon.\r\n\r\nIt began then--just a tiny bead of fear way down inside his belly. But\r\nit grew. He felt suffocated, claustrophobic, oppressed by fakery and\r\ncheapness.\r\n\r\nGlory was laughing with delight. "Oh, it\'s wonderful!"\r\n\r\nShut up! 

Pete thought savagely. Shut up, _shut up_!\r\n\r\nWith an effort, he got hold of himself.\r\n\r\nI\'ve been working too hard. I\'m jittery thinking about the moonshot,\r\nand all this seedy burlesque just irritates me. There\'s nothing to get\r\nheated up about. 

Calm down.\r\n\r\nBut why am I suddenly afraid?\r\n\r\nHe looked again at the ridiculous moon with its smirking face. He saw\r\nthat plaster had fallen from the wall in places, peeling away, leaving\r\nthe bare hexagons of wire and laths.\r\n\r\nMy God, he thought. A chickenwire sky.\r\n\r\nHe thought again of the girl in the ticket booth, and of the tired,\r\nfrightened people all laughing too much and shoving and running outside.\r\n\r\nThe bullet started down at last, toward the hinged door. On this side\r\nit was painted to look like Earth, with a distorted map of North\r\nAmerica. All wrong, somehow.\r\n\r\nPete felt ill. It was as though someone were making ill-tempered fun\r\nof the dreams and the tall silver ship waiting out on the desert.\r\nCheapening it. Laughing nastily.\r\n\r\nThe little bullet bumped through the seedy, scruffy Earth and out\r\ninto the night of the midway, out into the crowd-sounds and music and\r\nhot-doggy smells.\r\n\r\n"It was fun, Pete," Glory said.\r\n\r\nHe helped her out onto the rickety platform. He had the insane notion\r\nthat the girl in the ticket booth and the lounging attendant were\r\nlaughing at him.\r\n\r\n"It sure was, honey," he said wearily, still feeling the illogical fear\r\nof he-knew-not-what inside himself. "Real fun."\r\n\r\nGlory looked up at him, eyes alight and almost feverishly gay. "I did\r\nwhat you are going to do. I touched the sky!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNew frontiers. New lands in the sky. New hope.\r\n\r\nIt was quiet. The jet was still and no sound was anywhere in the ship.\r\nNow a soft tick from the timer. A whisper from the questing radarscope.\r\nAnd again, the stillness.\r\n\r\nWe\'ve done it, Pete thought. We\'ve really done it. The hard part is\r\nover.\r\n\r\nRide the rocket!\r\n\r\nHe remembered the pain of the takeoff and the absolute panic that had\r\nwelled up in him when the irrevocability of his action came home. He\r\nremembered riding a tail of red fire up out of the hot desert air of\r\nNew Mexico into the still blue, and then the silence and the almost\r\nunnerving thrill of the realization that the moonshot was going to\r\nsucceed.\r\n\r\nThe radio hissed at him with the voice of the desert base half around\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n"Hello moonshot. This is Base. 

All\'s okay. Stage one landed in the\r\nGulf. Stage two just reported floating off the Azores. Good show."\r\n\r\nPete lifted himself from the acceleration couch and felt a moment of\r\nnausea and panic as he floated toward the ceiling of the tiny cell.\r\nFree flight. He steadied himself and checked the flow of telemetered\r\ninformation binding the ship to the glowing curve far below. All okay.\r\nExcept that--\r\n\r\nExcept that you\'re still afraid, he told himself. Not just the normal\r\nfear-of-falling-afraid that the psychs told you about. Afraid like\r\nbefore--in that silly damn carnival ride thing.\r\n\r\nAfraid of the dark?\r\n\r\nNo, not quite that. More a closed in, cheated feeling.\r\n\r\nPremonition? Nonsense.\r\n\r\nHe clung to the radarscope, trembling. With every rushing mile upward,\r\noutward, his fear was growing. It wasn\'t right, it didn\'t make sense.\r\nBut he felt as though he were rushing straight at a brick wall, head\r\ndown, eyes closed.\r\n\r\nHe lit the telescreens.\r\n\r\nThe stars look funny, he thought uneasily.\r\n\r\nThe timer ticked. The radar whispered, searching. Time passed and his\r\nfear grew thicker, less reasonable.\r\n\r\nHis fingers dug hard at the metal of the instrument panel as the night\r\nslipped by outside the hull. The ship\'s orbital ellipse, Kepler\'s\r\ncontribution to the new frontier, was established.\r\n\r\nPete thought, something\'s wrong. Very wrong. The stars look queer.\r\n\r\nThe constellations in the telescreens were distorting, and there\r\nwas something ahead of the ship where there should be nothing but\r\nemptiness. It showed in the screen for just an instant and was lost. A\r\nringed sphere.\r\n\r\nI must be dreaming, Pete thought. But then, what is reality? That\r\nsphere was Saturn. And it was a hundred yards across.\r\n\r\nReality? _Insanity!_\r\n\r\nI\'d better check with Base, Pete thought, and tell them I\'ve gone off\r\nmy rocker, that I\'m suffering hallucinations.\r\n\r\nBut he did nothing except cling shaking to the panel, watching the\r\ndistorted stars in the screen. They were blurring now, streaks of light\r\nthat seemed to be very close to the ship.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd then came the moon. It came and went very quickly, pocked and\r\nscarred and with only one face. 

And _small_. Very small and very close.\r\n\r\nPete felt closed in, suffocated. The radar alarm was screaming at him\r\nthat something was near, too near.\r\n\r\nHe clamped down savagely on himself. There was an explanation\r\nsomewhere. He had to find it! He had to think!\r\n\r\nItem. The stars. Distorted. Blurred.\r\n\r\nItem. Saturn. A hundred yards across.\r\n\r\nItem. A tiny replica of the moon, like a pimple on the inside of an egg.\r\n\r\nReplica? No. _The_ moon. The only moon. Reality.\r\n\r\nHypothesis. Say that space is not as men imagined it. Say that it is an\r\nillusion, without lightyears, without great suns, without huge planets.\r\nSay for the sake of argument that it is a shell with holes in it, and\r\nlight outside, and the Sun itself an illusion of heat and power, and--\r\n\r\nSay that this hollow shell is man\'s new frontier; a fraud, a toy for\r\nthings outside--\r\n\r\nThe alarm screamed at him. The ship was plunging toward the blurry\r\nlight of the stars.\r\n\r\nWith an icy hand on his heart, Pete Moore turned to look at the\r\ntelescreen behind him. A misty blue ball swam in musty darkness. 

The\r\noceans gleamed in the light of the sun, cloud masses whitened it, the\r\nwrinkled face of the land looked unreal--\r\n\r\nHe began to laugh. Tears streaked his cheeks as he pounded his bloody\r\nfists against the instrument panel in time to the clanging of the alarm.\r\n\r\nThe Earth, the Earth--\r\n\r\nIt _did_ rather look like papier-m\xc3\xa2ch\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\nHe touched the sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


His\r\nvision went beyond the Congress of the United States, past the balmy\r\nJune day to another day that was coming. A day when the Army would have\r\nits destined place of authority.\r\n\r\nHe drew a deep breath and delivered what was perhaps the shortest speech\r\never heard in the hallowed halls of Congress:\r\n\r\n"The General Staff of the U.S. Army requests Congress to abolish the\r\narchaic branch of the armed forces known as the U.S. Navy."\r\n\r\nThe aging Senator from Georgia checked his hearing aid to see if it was\r\nin operating order, while the press box emptied itself in one concerted\r\nrush and a clatter of running feet that died off in the direction of the\r\ntelephone room. A buzz of excited comment ran through the giant chamber.\r\nOne by one the heads turned to face the Naval section where rows of blue\r\nfigures stirred and buzzed like smoked-out bees. The knot of men around\r\na paunchy figure heavy with gold braid broke up and Admiral Fitzjames\r\nclimbed slowly to his feet.\r\n\r\nLesser men have quailed before that piercing stare, but General Wingrove\r\nwas never the lesser man. The admiral tossed his head with disgust,\r\nevery line of his body denoting outraged dignity. He turned to his\r\naudience, a small pulse beating in his forehead.\r\n\r\n"I cannot comprehend the general\'s attitude, nor can I understand why he\r\nhas attacked the Navy in this unwarranted fashion. The Navy has existed\r\nand will always exist as the first barrier of American defense. I ask\r\nyou, gentlemen, to ignore this request as you would ignore the\r\nstatements of any person ... er, slightly demented. I should like to\r\noffer a recommendation that the general\'s sanity be investigated, and an\r\ninquiry be made as to the mental health of anyone else connected with\r\nthis preposterous proposal!"\r\n\r\nThe general smiled calmly. "I understand, Admiral, and really don\'t\r\nblame you for being slightly annoyed. But, please let us not bring this\r\nissue of national importance down to a shallow personal level. The Army\r\nhas facts to back up this request--facts that shall be demonstrated\r\ntomorrow morning."\r\n\r\nTurning his back on the raging admiral, General Wingrove included all\r\nthe assembled solons in one sweeping gesture.\r\n\r\n"Reserve your judgment until that time, gentlemen, make no hasty\r\njudgments until you have seen the force of argument with which we back\r\nup our request. It is the end of an era. In the morning the Navy joins\r\nits fellow fossils, the dodo and the brontosaurus."\r\n\r\nThe admiral\'s blood pressure mounted to a new record and the gentle thud\r\nof his unconscious body striking the floor was the only sound to break\r\nthe shocked silence of the giant hall.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe early morning sun warmed the white marble of the Jefferson Memorial\r\nand glinted from the soldiers\' helmets and the roofs of the packed cars\r\nthat crowded forward in a slow-moving stream. All the gentlemen of\r\nCongress were there, the passage of their cars cleared by the screaming\r\nsirens of motorcycle policemen. 

Around and under the wheels of the\r\nofficial cars pressed a solid wave of government workers and common\r\ncitizens of the capital city. The trucks of the radio and television\r\nservices pressed close, microphones and cameras extended.\r\n\r\nThe stage was set for a great day. Neat rows of olive drab vehicles\r\ncurved along the water\'s edge. Jeeps and half-tracks shouldered close by\r\nweapons carriers and six-bys, all of them shrinking to insignificance\r\nbeside the looming Patton tanks. A speakers\' platform was set up in the\r\ncenter of the line, near the audience.\r\n\r\nAt precisely 10 a.m., General Wingrove stepped forward and scowled at\r\nthe crowd until they settled into an uncomfortable silence. His speech\r\nwas short and consisted of nothing more than amplifications of his\r\nopening statement that actions speak louder than words. He pointed to\r\nthe first truck in line, a 2\xc2\xbd-ton filled with an infantry squad sitting\r\nstiffly at attention.\r\n\r\nThe driver caught the signal and kicked the engine into life; with a\r\ngrind of gears it moved forward toward the river\'s edge. There was an\r\nindrawn gasp from the crowd as the front wheels ground over the marble\r\nparapet--then the truck was plunging down toward the muddy waters of the\r\nPotomac.\r\n\r\nThe wheels touched the water and the surface seemed to sink while taking\r\non a strange glassy character. The truck roared into high gear and rode\r\nforward on the surface of the water surrounded by a saucer-shaped\r\ndepression. It parked two hundred yards off shore and the soldiers,\r\ngoaded by the sergeant\'s bark, leapt out and lined up with a showy\r\n_present arms_.\r\n\r\nThe general returned the salute and waved to the remaining vehicles.\r\nThey moved forward in a series of maneuvers that indicated a great\r\nnumber of rehearsal hours on some hidden pond. The tanks rumbled slowly\r\nover the water while the jeeps cut back and forth through their lines in\r\nintricate patterns. The trucks backed and turned like puffing\r\nballerinas.\r\n\r\nThe audience was rooted in a hushed silence, their eyeballs bulging.\r\nThey continued to watch the amazing display as General Wingrove spoke\r\nagain:\r\n\r\n"You see before you a typical example of Army ingenuity, developed in\r\nArmy laboratories. These motor units are supported on the surface of the\r\nwater by an intensifying of the surface tension in their immediate area.\r\nTheir weight is evenly distributed over the surface, causing the shallow\r\ndepressions you see around them.\r\n\r\n"This remarkable feat has been accomplished by the use of the\r\n_Dornifier_. A remarkable invention that is named after that brilliant\r\nscientist, Colonel Robert A. Dorn, Commander of the Brooke Point\r\nExperimental Laboratory. It was there that one of the civilian employees\r\ndiscovered the Dorn effect--under the Colonel\'s constant guidance, of\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\n"Utilizing this invention the Army now becomes master of the sea as well\r\nas the land. Army convoys of trucks and tanks can blanket the world. 

The\r\nsurface of the water is our highway, our motor park, our\r\nbattleground--the airfield and runway for our planes."\r\n\r\nMechanics were pushing a Shooting Star onto the water. They stepped\r\nclear as flame gushed from the tail pipe; with the familiar whooshing\r\nrumble it sped down the Potomac and hurled itself into the air.\r\n\r\n"When this cheap and simple method of crossing oceans is adopted, it\r\nwill of course mean the end of that fantastic medieval anachronism, the\r\nNavy. No need for billion-dollar aircraft carriers, battleships,\r\ndrydocks and all the other cumbersome junk that keeps those boats and\r\nthings afloat. Give the taxpayer back his hard-earned dollar!"\r\n\r\nTeeth grated in the Naval section as carriers and battleships were\r\ncalled "boats" and the rest of America\'s sea might lumped under the\r\ncasual heading of "things." Lips were curled at the transparent appeal\r\nto the taxpayer\'s pocketbook. 

But with leaden hearts they knew that all\r\nthis justified wrath and contempt would avail them nothing. This was\r\nArmy Day with a vengeance, and the doom of the Navy seemed inescapable.\r\n\r\nThe Army had made elaborate plans for what they called "Operation\r\nSinker." Even as the general spoke the publicity mills ground into high\r\ngear. From coast to coast the citizens absorbed the news with their\r\nmorning nourishment.\r\n\r\n"... Agnes, you hear what the radio said! The Army\'s gonna give a trip\r\naround the world in a B-36 as first prize in this limerick contest. All\r\nyou have to do is fill in the last line, and mail one copy to the\r\nPentagon and the other to the Navy ..."\r\n\r\nThe Naval mail room had standing orders to burn all the limericks when\r\nthey came in, but some of the newer men seemed to think the entire thing\r\nwas a big joke. Commander Bullman found one in the mess hall:\r\n\r\n    _The Army will always be there,\r\n    On the land, on the sea, in the air.\r\n    So why should the Navy\r\n    Take all of the gravy ..._\r\n\r\nto which a seagoing scribe had added:\r\n\r\n    _And not give us ensigns our share?_\r\n\r\nThe newspapers were filled daily with photographs of mighty B-36\'s\r\nlanding on Lake Erie, and grinning soldiers making mock beachhead\r\nattacks on Coney Island. Each man wore a buzzing black box at his waist\r\nand walked on the bosom of the now quiet Atlantic like a biblical\r\nprophet.\r\n\r\nRadio and television also carried the thousands of news releases that\r\npoured in an unending flow from the Pentagon Building. 

Cards, letters,\r\ntelegrams and packages descended on Washington in an overwhelming\r\ntorrent. The Navy Department was the unhappy recipient of deprecatory\r\nletters and a vast quantity of little cardboard battleships.\r\n\r\nThe people spoke and their representatives listened closely. This was an\r\nelection year. There didn\'t seem to be much doubt as to the decision,\r\nparticularly when the reduction in the budget was considered.\r\n\r\nIt took Congress only two months to make up its collective mind. The\r\npeople were all pro-Army. The novelty of the idea had fired their\r\nimaginations.\r\n\r\nThey were about to take the final vote in the lower house. If the\r\namendment passed it would go to the states for ratification, and their\r\nvotes were certain to follow that of Congress. The Navy had fought a\r\nlast-ditch battle to no avail. The balloting was going to be pretty much\r\nof a sure thing--the wet water Navy would soon become ancient history.\r\n\r\nFor some reason the admirals didn\'t look as unhappy as they should.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Naval Department had requested one last opportunity to address the\r\nCongress. Congress had patronizingly granted permission, for even the\r\ndoomed man is allowed one last speech. Admiral Fitzjames, who had\r\nrecovered from his choleric attack, was the appointed speaker.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen of the Congress of the United States. We in the Navy have a\r\nfighting tradition. 

We \'damn the torpedoes\' and sail straight ahead into\r\nthe enemy\'s fire if that is necessary. We have been stabbed in the\r\nback--we have suffered a second Pearl Harbor sneak attack! The Army\r\nrelinquished its rights to fair treatment with this attack. 

Therefore we\r\nare _counter-attacking_!" Worn out by his attacking and mixed metaphors,\r\nthe Admiral mopped his brow.\r\n\r\n"Our laboratories have been working night and day on the perfection of a\r\ndevice we hoped we would never be forced to use. It is now in operation,\r\nhaving passed the final trials a few days ago.\r\n\r\n"The significance of this device _cannot_ be underestimated. We are so\r\npositive of its importance that--we are _demanding_ that the _Army_ be\r\nabolished!"\r\n\r\nHe waved his hand toward the window and bellowed one word.\r\n\r\n"LOOK!"\r\n\r\nEveryone looked. 

They blinked and looked again. They rubbed their eyes\r\nand kept looking.\r\n\r\nSailing majestically up the middle of Constitution Avenue was the\r\nbattleship Missouri.\r\n\r\nThe Admiral\'s voice rang through the room like a trumpet of victory.\r\n\r\n"The Mark-1 Debinder, as you see, temporarily lessens the binding\r\nenergies that hold molecules of solid matter together. Solids become\r\nliquids, and a ship equipped with this device can sail anywhere in the\r\nworld--on sea _or_ land. 

Take your vote, gentlemen; the world awaits\r\nyour decision."\r\n\r\n                                                           ...

He was going to refuse to die._\r\n\r\n\r\nBart Neely was fighting the hypo. They\'d slipped that over on him. 

Now\r\nhe had to struggle to keep his brain ready for plan B. The alternate\r\nplan. He nodded feebly at his reflection in the mirror over the white\r\nenamel dresser. This throat-trouble wasn\'t going to lick him. He lay\r\nback on the cool white pillow. Medical men always thought theirs was the\r\nfinal answer; well, psychologists like himself knew there was a broader\r\nview of man than the anatomical. There was a vast region of energy at\r\nman\'s disposal; the switch to turn it on, located in the brain.\r\n\r\nRubber-soled shoes squished across the bare floor as Dr. Jonas Morton\r\ncame into Bart\'s room. His hair was hidden by a sterile cap, his arms\r\nbare to well above the elbows.\r\n\r\nLooks like a damned butcher, thought Bart.\r\n\r\n"Bart, I want you to reconsider the anesthetic. I think you ought to be\r\nout for this one, completely out." The doctor\'s voice became a shade\r\nless professional. "I don\'t tell you how to run your perception\r\nexperiments, I think you ought to let me judge what\'s best in the\r\nsurgical area."\r\n\r\n"No," Bart whispered hoarsely. It was hell squeezing the words out.\r\nLifting his voice these days was harder than lifting a half-ton truck.\r\n"Must be conscious, able to decide." Jonas had to lean down to catch all\r\nthe words. "Not going to let you take my voice while I\'m unconscious ...\r\nhelpless ..."\r\n\r\nDr. Morton shook his head. "You\'re the boss."\r\n\r\n"How soon?"\r\n\r\n"Twenty minutes." The professional tone became pronounced again. "Your\r\nwife\'s outside waiting to see you. Don\'t get emotional, I don\'t want\r\nyour endocrine system in an uproar." The doctor stepped out into the\r\ncorridor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEmotional. He mustn\'t think about it. He might weaken, consent to linger\r\non, an invalid, just to be with Vivian a few extra years. Extra years of\r\nindignities calculated to twist the man-woman relationship into an ugly\r\ndistortion. How romantic it would be, he and Vivian locked in an\r\nembrace, the silky softness of her hair falling across his arm, the\r\npressure of her fingers on his back. And then, instead of placing his\r\nmouth against her ear and whispering the familiar intimacies, he would\r\nswitch on the light, disengage himself so that he could whip out a pad\r\nand pencil and ...\r\n\r\nHis heart skipped at the sound pattern of high heels on the corridor.\r\nVivian, Vivian. Her perfume pricked his senses and it took effort to\r\nshut out the emotional response. "Remember the need for an alternate\r\nplan," he reminded himself fiercely and then looked up into his wife\'s\r\nclear green eyes. Without a word she bent down and lay her face next to\r\nhis. He was struck with the warmth of her. He gently pushed her head\r\naway. "Vi." (My Lord, his eyes were wet ... what a schoolboy\r\nperformance!) "Vi, you know I don\'t want to go on here ... if radical\r\nsurgery is necessary. I want you to remember me as a whole man, not\r\na ... 

dummy.

"\r\n\r\n"Bart, oh Bart." There was a frown of apprehension on her forehead. She\r\nsighed heavily and whispered, "Can it make so much difference when I\r\nlove you Bart?"\r\n\r\n"But don\'t you see, Vi? It may not be Bart Neely they wheel back here\r\nafter the operation." He motioned for her to bend closer for the sound\r\nof his voice was becoming weaker. "In my field I\'ve seen a lot of crazy\r\nreactions to loss of basic ability. Personality reversals brought about\r\nby loss of hearing, impotency, or even the inability to bear a child."\r\nHe stroked the back of her hand with his finger. "Bart Neely without a\r\nvoice-box might be a stranger. I\'m not sure you\'d like him. 

I don\'t\r\nthink I\'d even like him."\r\n\r\nAn intern backed into the room followed by a gurney. Bart shot a look at\r\nVi. "This is plan A."\r\n\r\nVi\'s eyebrows arched in a question.\r\n\r\n"Exploration and ..." he paused; the nurse tucked a dark gray blanket\r\nall around him. He raised his thin white hand and crossed two fingers ...\r\n"and we hope, a negative biopsy."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was no pain. Whatever the anesthetist had worked out was doing\r\nnicely. The overhead light, however, was giving him a headache and the\r\noperating room was damned cold. Jonas and Holsclaw weren\'t talking\r\nmuch, and what they did say wasn\'t loud enough for Bart to get. He\r\nstudied their faces. "I\'ll know by their faces," he assured himself,\r\n"and if it\'s widespread malignancy I\'ll proceed with plan B."\r\n\r\nThe sweat was heavy on Jonas\' forehead. The sterile mask hid his nose\r\nand mouth, but his eyes, behind the lenses of his glasses, looked moist\r\nand tired. The surgeon\'s gloved fingers manipulated, probed, cut.\r\nFinally, he turned to a waiting nurse.\r\n\r\n"Get this analyzed right away." That was it, the tissue ... was it\r\ncancerous or not? 

The atmosphere grew heavy. Bart watched the second\r\nhand on the large wall-clock swing slowly around its perimeter, and then\r\naround again and again. The nurse reentered and spoke softly to the\r\ndoctor. The two doctors whispered, explaining to each other with hand\r\nmotions what they were going to do.\r\n\r\nThis is it. Bart was certain. Well, he\'d fool the hell out of the\r\nknow-it-all doctors. He closed his eyes and thought. The years he had\r\nspent sharpening his perception, his ability to transfer his thoughts,\r\nwere just the groundwork for this greatest experiment of all. He had\r\ntransferred thought waves in all forms to all corners of this world with\r\nthe highest percentage of accuracy. Now Plan B, the alternate plan, was\r\nto transfer himself! He was willing himself out of his own body. He\r\ncould feel the perspiration trickle down his arms with the effort. It\r\nhad to work. He had to cheat them out of their mutilation. No, he\r\ncouldn\'t fail. He strained against the confines of his body, burdening\r\nhis brain with thought, and suddenly he was free. Bart wanted to shriek\r\nwith laughter. He\'d outwitted them. There stood gray-faced Jonas working\r\nover that shell, not even realizing that it was an empty body. It was\r\nlike a television play or something; everyone clustered around a poor\r\nstiff on the operating table, repeating the litany of the saw-bones.\r\n"Scalpel ... sponge ... clamps ..."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBart mentally chuckled and fluttered himself upwards; above the\r\nsquare-shaped hospital with its rows of tiny windows. Beyond the\r\npolluted air of the city. 

Up and up, until there was nothing to look\r\nback on. Nothing.\r\n\r\nNow Bart perceived something ahead. It appeared to be a body of land. It\r\nlooked marvelously appealing, dark greens, bright yellows, and all the\r\nshades in between. He hurried forward, eager to explore what lay ahead.\r\nBut as he drew closer, becoming more excited over its possibilities, he\r\nstruck a cold hard surface which repelled him. It was like glass and\r\nthrough it Bart could see a poorly defined figure some distance away.\r\nBart was intrigued. This was a mental barrier thrown up by the fellow on\r\nthe other side. Well, he\'d give the guy some competition. Bart\r\nconcentrated on cracking the wall, building a visual picture of the\r\nbreak-through in his mind.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"It\'s useless. You can\'t enter here."\r\n\r\n"Why do you oppose me?" Bart tested the unseen wall, but found no\r\nweakness in its structure.\r\n\r\n"We don\'t care for your sort."\r\n\r\n"Is that so. 

And how have you classified me?"\r\n\r\n"As a coward. A suicide. A man of meager resources."\r\n\r\n"I\'m nothing of the kind. In the first place, I did not commit suicide."\r\nBart wished he could kick at the invisible wall. "I willed myself away\r\nfrom an imperfect shell. I severed the mind from the body."\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"Because I had cancer of the larynx, and I\'d never have been able to\r\ntalk again. I\'d be less than a man."\r\n\r\n"You are less than a man now." There was a long period of no exchange.\r\nBart decided he had not made himself clear. "I didn\'t want to live\r\nwithout being able to communicate with other men and women."\r\n\r\n"Communicate. Communicate. There are a million ways to communicate.\r\nMichelangelo communicated, Bach, Beethoven, yes, Elvis Presley\r\ncommunicates. Hemingway, Martha Graham, actors, dancers, even a baby\r\ncommunicates!"\r\n\r\n"But speech ..."\r\n\r\n"Speech is the least dependable method of all. Few people can explain\r\ntheir love, their pain, their innermost feelings in words. And often a\r\nman speaks his thoughts, and having spoken them, finds he really thinks\r\nthe opposite. No, this is second-rate expression and my opinion of you\r\nhas not been altered by your feeble argument."\r\n\r\nThe other fellow\'s thoughts came over the wall, pounding against Bart\'s\r\nsub-conscious. "You consider yourself a man of great intelligence," it\r\nwent on, "but your lack of imagination makes you less than mediocre. And\r\nas for your mind-power, well, you see you cannot cross my mental\r\nbarrier."\r\n\r\n"That\'s not entirely conclusive. There may be a catalyst here in this\r\narea which works in conjunction with your thought-processes and not\r\nmine. You\'re familiar with conditions here, while I only know the\r\nearth.

"\r\n\r\n"You are hardly a challenge to me. However, to satisfy you that you have\r\npractically no control, let us make a test on your home ground."\r\n\r\n"All right. 

You propose the test."\r\n\r\n"Let us see ... if you can re-enter your former body while I am willing\r\nyou to stay here, on the other side of that wall."\r\n\r\n"Ahah. You\'re trying to trick me."\r\n\r\n"I knew before I proposed my plan you would make exactly that excuse in\r\norder to escape my challenge. Even in excuses you lacked imagination."\r\n\r\n"Okay, it\'s a deal." Bart was mad. "Start concentrating. I\'ll show you\r\nthe power of my mind, both now and after I resume that shell." Bart was\r\nfurious. He tried to leave the place by the wall. He seemed stuck. There\r\nwere waves like laughter vibrating against the glass. Bart strained and\r\nsaw that he had come away a little. He tried again and again. 

There was\r\na little more distance gained. He tried to build the picture of the\r\noperating-room in his mind and while he was doing this a flash of Vivian\r\nexploded his mind. With that quick image, he felt himself free to drift\r\ndownward.\r\n\r\nThere indeed was the hospital. Bart hurried to the operating-room,\r\nhovering near the ceiling light, watching the operating team below.\r\n\r\n"He\'s gone, doctor." The anesthetist looked at Jonas. "Respiration\'s\r\nstopped altogether."\r\n\r\n_No_, thought Bart. _Don\'t close me out now._\r\n\r\n"Let\'s open the chest and massage the heart."\r\n\r\n_Yes. Yes._\r\n\r\n"I think it\'s futile, doctor.

"\r\n\r\n"We can try."\r\n\r\n_Good old Jonas._ Bart floated to the table and forced himself into the\r\nshell which lay white and unmoving under the penetrating light from\r\nabove. It wasn\'t easy, Bart tried to move the heavy hand, but it was\r\nquite numb.\r\n\r\n"Not a thing. Might as well quit."\r\n\r\n_Holsclaw\'s in a hurry. Damn him._\r\n\r\n"I\'ll massage a little longer."\r\n\r\nBart pushed at the leaden eyelid. No go. _Come on, come on._ He felt a\r\nconvulsive chill, a throbbing in his head.\r\n\r\n"I\'m getting a pulse." Jonas\' voice was excited.\r\n\r\nBart knew there was a searing pain in his throat, but shutting it out of\r\nhis consciousness was the steady, thumping beat of his own heart.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Science Fiction Stories_\r\n    September 1958.

But I knew we were within\r\nforty or fifty miles of the Trans-Space base. I had counted the miles on\r\nthis particular trip because of the load of radium we were carrying from\r\nthe Venusian mines. I wouldn\'t draw a completely relieved breath until\r\nwe were down and the stuff was in the hands of the commerce agents.\r\n\r\nI eased my position slightly to relieve the pressure on my broken\r\nflipper and grinned at the pilot, Lucky Larson, the screwiest, most\r\nunpredictable void trotter who had ever flown for dear old Trans-Space.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve been too good to be true this trip," I said, "and it\'s a good\r\nthing. The chief told me that if you so much as _thought_ about clowning\r\naround or stunting he was going to clip your wings for good."\r\n\r\nLucky grinned, an impish, devil-may-care grin that lightened up his\r\nfreckled face and bunched the tiny wrinkles at the corners of his eyes.\r\nThen with characteristic abruptness he scowled.\r\n\r\n"That grandmother," he said disgustedly. "Who does he think I am,\r\nanyway? Some crazy irresponsible madman who hasn\'t got enough brains to\r\nstay on a space beam?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s just what he does think," I grinned, "and you\'ve given him\r\nplenty of reason to think it. You can\'t bring your crate in to the base\r\nwithout stunting around and showing off and risking your damn neck.\r\nThat\'s why he sent me along with you this trip. Just to see that you\r\nact like a pilot--instead of circus acrobat.

"\r\n\r\n"A lot of good you\'d do," Lucky mumbled. "You got a broken arm. The only\r\nreason he sent you is because he didn\'t want to pay you while you was in\r\nthe hospital so he cooks up this trip to get his money out of you. And\r\nsay," he turned to me belligerently, "when did I ever crack up a ship?\r\nWhen did I ever even dent one of the babies?"\r\n\r\n"You haven\'t," I was forced to admit, "but that\'s just because of that\r\nscrewy luck of yours. But it won\'t last forever and one of these days\r\nit\'s going to run out just when you need it. So just remember--no\r\nstunting this trip or you\'ll be out of the strata for the rest of your\r\nnatural life."\r\n\r\n"Aw, that\'s the trouble with this racket," Lucky grumbled, "a guy can\'t\r\nhave no fun no more. Back when I was with the Space circus--"\r\n\r\n"Okay, okay," I cut in, "I\'ve heard that before. Just fly your ship,\r\nnow, and forget about the deep dark plot of the company to take all the\r\njoy out of your life. I\'m going to take a look-see at the atomic floats\r\nand get the passengers bundled together."\r\n\r\nI stood up and crawled over him and opened the door leading to the body\r\nof the ship. I could still hear him grumbling as I slid the light\r\nchrome-alloy door shut. 

I chuckled to myself and headed up the aisle to\r\nthe baggage compartments. Lucky Larson was a legend as space pilots go.\r\nAn unpredictable, erratic screwball but one of the finest rocket riders\r\nwho ever flashed through the void.\r\n\r\nCompany regulations and interplanetary commissions were the bane of his\r\nexistence. He made his own rules and regulations and got by with it.\r\nThat is he _had_ gotten by with it. Now they were cracking down on him.\r\nHe had been grounded twice and the chief had threatened to set him down\r\nfor life if any more infractions were charged to him. I shook my head\r\ngloomily. 

He was a great guy, the last of a great and gallant army of\r\nspace adventurers, but he was on the way out. The rules were necessary,\r\nvital to safe space travel and the Lucky Larsons would have to live up\r\nto them, or else.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy mind was a long way away from the cabin of the space ship and maybe\r\nthat\'s why I got what I did. I didn\'t see it coming. One minute I was\r\nwalking through the aisle, thinking about Lucky Larson and the next\r\nsecond something slammed into the back of my head knocking me to my\r\nknees.\r\n\r\nThrough a haze of red and white lights I heard a voice bark, "Toss him\r\ninto a chair and grab that good arm of his."\r\n\r\nI wasn\'t out. 

Just damn sick. Something like a cold hand seemed to have\r\nclosed over my stomach and for an awful moment I gagged and tried to\r\nretch. But the moment passed and I forced open my eyes and focused them\r\non two tough-looking, hard-eyed gents who stood in front of me. Another\r\nunpleasant-looking little man knelt along side of me, twisting my good\r\narm behind my back.\r\n\r\n"Okay," I gritted, "what\'s the gag?"\r\n\r\nThe tallest of the three, evidently their leader, smiled at me. "It\'s no\r\ngag," he murmured calmly, "we happen to need the radium you\'re carrying.\r\nWe\'re going to take it. Any objections?"\r\n\r\n"You\'ll never get away with this," I snapped, "your names and\r\ndescriptions are registered with the passenger office. You\'ll be tracked\r\ndown in twenty-four hours."\r\n\r\nI was bluffing, of course, and I knew from their contemptuous smiles\r\nthat they knew it, too. They probably had given fictitious names, and\r\nthe descriptive information which the bureau required consisted of a few\r\ngeneralities, such as height, weight and the like. I cursed myself for a\r\nstupid, careless fool. The three men had been the only passengers from\r\nVenus and they had kept to themselves the entire trip. Once or twice I\r\nhad wondered at their reticence and quietness but I had not been\r\nsuspicious enough to make a check-up.\r\n\r\nOne of the men laughed shortly. "Let us worry about that. 

We\'ve covered\r\nevery angle that could possibly come up. With the help of your friend up\r\nfront, this ship will be flown to a certain deserted asteroid where a\r\nfew friends of _ours_ are to meet us with another ship. How you come out\r\nafterward will depend on how you co-operate now. 

Clear enough?

"\r\n\r\nIt was clear enough all right. Lucky and I wouldn\'t last long after we\r\nserved our purpose.\r\n\r\nThe tall man turned from me and nodded significantly to the man standing\r\nnext to him and then pointed to the closed door to the pilot\'s chambers.\r\n\r\n"Take care of the pilot," he murmured, "and tell him if he isn\'t\r\nobliging we\'ll take the cast off his friend\'s arm and--" he smiled at\r\nme, "massage it a bit."\r\n\r\nI felt a cold sweat break out on my forehead.\r\n\r\nThe thug grinned wolfishly at me and then winked at his leader. "I\'ll\r\ntell him, boss." He dug his hand into his pocket and drew out a stubby\r\natomic pistol. "If he won\'t listen to me maybe this\'ll persuade him."\r\n\r\nStill grinning he turned and headed up the aisle, the gun clenched in\r\nhis huge fist.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI glanced at the tall figure standing in front of me and saw that he was\r\nwatching the retreating figure of his henchman with a saturnine smile on\r\nhis face. I thought swiftly. If I could yell a warning to Lucky, he\r\ncould bolt the door of the pilot\'s chamber and then set the ship down at\r\nthe Trans-Space base. It was the only way to save Lucky and the radium.\r\nI wasn\'t very optimistic about my own chances. I knew they were zero.\r\n\r\nI opened my mouth, took a deep breath and then, before I could scream\r\nthe words that would warn Lucky, it happened. The ship shuddered for an\r\ninstant and then zoomed upward, the smooth hum of the rocket motors\r\ncrescendoing to a roaring song of power and speed.\r\n\r\nThe sudden jolting acceleration hurled me to the tail of the ship and I\r\nsaw, like an image in a kaleidoscope, the tangled thrashing figures of\r\nthe space bandits as they were tossed to the floor, a dazedly struggling\r\nmass of arms and legs.\r\n\r\nThe ship was lying over on its back in a few seconds, and before I could\r\ncatch a breath it suddenly whipped over and blasted toward Earth in a\r\nscreeching, hissing power-dive.\r\n\r\nIt was terrific punishment even for this type of space crate but it was\r\nworse for human beings. The three bandits were clutching at their\r\nstomachs as if they were afraid of losing them. Their faces were mottled\r\nand blotchy and their eyes were rolling beseechingly.\r\n\r\nI didn\'t mind the erratic convolutions the ship was making but my arm\r\nwas burning as if it were on fire. Numbing waves of pain were coursing\r\nup and down my entire body.\r\n\r\nI tried to crawl to my knees but the floor rolled under me as the ship\r\nwhipped over in a twisting spiral and I crashed forward on my face. Then\r\neverything dissolved into inky blackness....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen I came to, I heard a great commotion, then a sudden shot and then a\r\nbabble of voices booming around me. I remember thinking fleetingly of\r\ncrooks, Lucky Larson and a mountain of radium and then--because nothing\r\nmade sense--I passed out again.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next time I opened my eyes I found myself stretched out on a cot in\r\nthe chief\'s office. I turned my head slightly and saw Lucky Larson, the\r\nchief and a half dozen other guys staring down at me.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not very original," I said, "but where the hell am I?" That was\r\nsilly of me because I knew where I was, so I said: "Never mind that but\r\nplease tell me what the hell happened?"\r\n\r\nThe chief laughed and Lucky Larson laughed and then they slapped each\r\nother on the back. "Don\'t worry about a thing," the chief said, "those\r\ncrooks are under lock and key and there\'s not a thing to worry about."\r\n\r\n"But how--I mean what...?" 

My voice trailed off. Nothing made sense.\r\n\r\n"Well," the chief broke in, "Lucky here really deserves the credit for\r\ncatching them. And I\'m not forgetting your good work either. Both of you\r\nwill receive more tangible evidence of my appreciation. But Lucky really\r\ndid the brainwork."\r\n\r\n"Awww," Lucky mumbled, "it wasn\'t much. Just a little common sense and,\r\nuh, a little luck."\r\n\r\n"It was damn fast thinking," the chief cut in belligerently, "you knew\r\nyour stunting over the base would drive me crazy. You knew I\'d get so\r\nmad I\'d call out the base police and have you thrown in when you moored.\r\nAnd when you did moor and the crooks toppled out we were right on hand\r\nto receive them. They were so weak from the shaking up you gave them\r\nthat they didn\'t have a chance.

"\r\n\r\nLucky rolled innocent eyes to the ceiling. "Sometimes," he remarked\r\npiously, "stunting has its uses."\r\n\r\n"Congratulations," I said weakly. "You certainly used your head. Caught\r\nthe chief\'s attention with your stunting and almost knocked the crooks\r\nout with it too. That\'s killing two birds with one stone, all right."\r\nThen another thought occurred to me.\r\n\r\n"How did you know I was in trouble?" I asked curiously. "How did you\r\nknow we had those crooks on board?"\r\n\r\n"Why--why," Lucky sputtered, "that was simple. I just happened to look\r\nbehind me and I saw those boys piling into you. So I did a little fast\r\nthinking and then I whipped the ship into a few maneuvers and, like the\r\nchief says, they caught his eye all right."\r\n\r\nThe chief was beaming fondly and I turned my head to hide the smile on\r\nmy lips. "So you just looked behind you," I muttered. "Well, Lucky, you\r\ncertainly are--and were."\r\n\r\nHe grinned down at me and winked. "You said it, kid."\r\n\r\nI wanted to ask him a question then, but I decided to wait until we were\r\nalone. I closed my eyes and smiled again, thinking of his expression\r\nwhen I would ask him how he had been able to look behind him and see me\r\nstruggling with those crooks, _when the door of the pilot\'s chamber was\r\nclosed all the time_....\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ January 1943.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

Yet here now were\r\nliving things crawling toward the machine, just like the excrescence at\r\none end but in no way a part of it! The feeling of _willed_ effort as\r\nthey crawled slowly toward it, white and pink striped, reaching grasping\r\nfeelers into the turgid product, taking it in, then rising on easing\r\nlegs as the food spread within them.\r\n\r\n"There _are_ living creatures here!" Creno pondered. 

"I feel your\r\nmessages. Twenty, thirty--a horde is crawling from that mountain toward\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Four thousand three hundred and ninety-one," said Harta. She\r\nconcentrated. "There are three thousand and five more in the mountain\r\ncaves, waiting to come out as the others return."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey came in groups of about a hundred, pulling themselves slowly toward\r\nthe edges of the great sticky lake that lay within the vaster area where\r\nthe pink matter dried and crumbled into the strong breeze. Some were\r\nsmaller than others, offspring who were nudged along by their elders.\r\nBut these small creatures were the ones who scampered most of all after\r\nthey had fed. Joyously they danced back toward the mountain. A few of\r\nmedium height went back in pairs, firm taffy fingers intertwined in each\r\nother.\r\n\r\n"They mate," said Creno. "It is their custom."\r\n\r\n"How tiring they are," said Harta. "I have lost interest. We have seen\r\nthirty-one worlds with such customs and these creatures are too simple\r\nto be interesting. Let us go home or try some other system.

"\r\n\r\n"Not yet," Creno insisted. "We passed through the ocean and surveyed the\r\nlands of this tiny planet. Nowhere else has there been the tiniest unit\r\nof life. Why at this one spot should something exist?"\r\n\r\n"But we have several parallel situations," Harta protested. "They were\r\ncolonies landed in one spot by the civilization of another planet. They\r\nlanded here with their feeder machine. 

And that is the explanation."\r\n\r\n"Your mind does not function well in a four-dimension continuum, Harta.\r\nYou will need more training--"\r\n\r\n"But these cases are rare, and, Creno--"\r\n\r\n"I know they are rare, my child. But still they exist. 

You will have to\r\nlearn eventually, a little at a time. Now then, it is a rule of such\r\nlimited dimensional realms that the movement of matter and events from\r\nplace to place is highly difficult. Certain compacting procedures must\r\nbe observed. To transport a machine this size across their space would\r\nhave required enormous effort and an intelligence they do not yet have.\r\nMore than that, it would have been unnecessary. A smaller device would\r\nhave supplied them with food. I am forced to conclude that--somehow--we\r\nare approaching this problem backwards."\r\n\r\n"Backwards? You mean they made the machine here after they came?"\r\n\r\nHe did not reply to that. "We must concentrate together on thinking\r\nourselves into their functioning in their manifold."\r\n\r\nHarta followed his suggestion, and soon their thoughts were moving among\r\nand within the striped creatures. The insides of their bodies consisted\r\nof fundamentally the same taffy substance; but it had been modified by\r\nvarious organic structures. All, though, were built of the same\r\nfundamental units: elongated, thin cells which readily aligned\r\nthemselves in semi-crystalline patterns.\r\n\r\n"Enough," Creno said, "back to the hill."\r\n\r\nTheir rows of thin limbs rested on the ridge crest once more. "We have\r\nseen such cell crystals before," she sighed. "The inefficiencies in such\r\na poverty of dimensions! Do you still think we have looked at it\r\nbackwards?

"\r\n\r\n"Of course we have. They did not bring the machine or make it--the\r\nmachine made them!"\r\n\r\n"That is not possible, Creno, great as you are in these matters. We have\r\nnever seen life created by a machine before. No one ever has, from the\r\nmillions of reports I have seen at home."\r\n\r\n"Maybe we have and not known it. The life we have seen always evolved\r\nthrough enormous eons and we could not see its origins clearly in most\r\ncases. Here we are dealing with something that has taken comparatively\r\nlittle time." He stopped, shocked that he, an elder, had said so much.\r\n"No, disregard such theories. You are still too young to bother with\r\nthem. Here is the important thing--this machine was left by an earlier\r\nrace that disappeared. Everything else was destroyed but it went right\r\non producing its substance."\r\n\r\n"The substance is not life."\r\n\r\n"It is only four-dimensional matter, right. But over a long enough\r\ntime--you know this as well as I do--random factors will eventually\r\nproduce a life form. By some trick of radiation this process has been\r\nspeeded up here. The substance the machine produces has in turn produced\r\nlife!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCreno sensed with a tremor some dangerous shifting in Harta\'s\r\nconsciousness. As an elder it was his duty to prevent a premature\r\ninsight in the young. It had been a mistake to bring this up. 

He must go\r\nno further.\r\n\r\nIt was not necessary. Harta took it up for him.\r\n\r\n"Then any substance producing life and modified by it could--if you go\r\nfar enough back--be the product of a machine. But it would have taken so\r\nlong to produce life that the original matter, that bore the direct\r\nimprint of the machine, would have disappeared."\r\n\r\n"An error," said Creno desperately. "There is just this case."\r\n\r\n"By the time these creatures have arrived at self-knowledge the machine\r\nwill be gone. They will not know it ever existed, and--"\r\n\r\n"That is all it means. 

There is just this one case. Now we must leave\r\nthis unimportant example of minor dimensions!"\r\n\r\nHe strained consciousness to a forward movement but Harta remained\r\nbehind. 

He had to pull back. "Start," he ordered.\r\n\r\nHer mind\'s obstinately frozen stance made him freeze too. He applied all\r\nhis force to bring her back into control, but she still held fast.\r\n\r\n"Something more is hidden from me. 

I will be back," she said. And she\r\ndisappeared from the ridge.\r\n\r\nHe had never faced such a quandary before on a training trip with a\r\nyounger one. If he went in pursuit he would find her ultimately--that\r\nwas in the nature of being older and wiser--but, if she revolted against\r\nhis pursuit, she could extend the time considerably on this forsaken\r\nplanet. And he wanted to get her away as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThe more time here the more chance that the awful truth would come to\r\nher before her time.\r\n\r\nHe watched the growing waves of creatures floundering toward the vast\r\noozing puddle, which refilled itself as quickly as it was diminished by\r\nthem, and the receding waves of those that had already fed. This, he\r\ncould see, was an endless process. The whole life of the species moved\r\nin continuous systole-diastole around the machine.\r\n\r\nSoon he would have to go in search of her.\r\n\r\nBut then she was back at his side, her being for this world once more\r\nsolidified. She concentrated for a moment on the pink-striped waves of\r\nrippling inward and outward around the great sustaining pool, then\r\ncommunicated with him.\r\n\r\n"We can leave now. There is nothing more to see."\r\n\r\nSomething in her mind remained closed to his, as the mind of younger\r\nnever should be to older. But at least he could see with relief that the\r\nworst had not happened. 

The deeper knowledge had not arrived to her too\r\nearly when it could only hurt. All he found turned to him--as they\r\nreceded from this thin-manifold universe, then moved up the dimension\r\nladder to their home level--was a surface of happiness.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, though, as they prepared for flight in that hyperspace all her\r\njoy was gone.\r\n\r\n"I saw it," she said. "In my free and unrestricted spirit I moved deep\r\ninto the substance of that world, below all the total ruin, far below.\r\nAnd there was a monstrous machine, near the molten core, almost\r\ninfinitely older than the feeding one far above it. And it, too, had\r\nbeen left in a stratum where all else was destroyed. I could see it had\r\nonce produced the ooze from which came the life from which in turn come\r\nthe beings by whom the machine above it was made. Maybe they, too,\r\nthought they were free and unrestricted!"\r\n\r\nHe sighed for the bitter cost of knowledge.\r\n\r\nThis one would no longer go forth in the joy of mere exploration, and he\r\nwould no longer live vicariously in the happiness of another being\'s\r\ninnocence. Now Harta, too, would be seeking the answer to the question\r\nof original creation, the answer that he had not found in his journeys\r\nacross a myriad worlds and dimensions....\r\n\r\nThat no one had ever found.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s Sweet Their Blood and Sticky, by Albert Teichner\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n


]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President of the Chamber of Commerce of Wheedonville by the Sea\r\nwas stately and rather terrifying in his measured wrath. Nor was his\r\nperoration against the dapper young-old man who sat at the foot of the\r\nlong mahogany conference table lessened by the knowledge that he had\r\nthe full support of the rest of that august body.\r\n\r\nBut Wiley Cordes, on whom all this anger was focussed, appeared\r\nsingularly uncowed by the disfavor in which he basked. As a seasoned\r\nresort promotion expert he was not unacquainted with municipal ire. So\r\nmany unforeseen factors could send resort trade swarming to the wrong\r\nresort--as had happened in this case.\r\n\r\nHaving talked himself into the fat job of putting Wheedonville on the\r\nmap as the sea-side town where vacationers would have the amusement\r\nworld at their feet, he had been forced to sit by and watch the bulk of\r\nthe available tourist vacation trade pass to Burden Bay, sixty miles\r\nto the south. It was too bad, of course, but a fellow could only do so\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\n"... and despite your definite assurance--in fact your promise--that\r\nretail trade in Wheedonville by the Sea would pick up a minimum of\r\ntwenty-five per cent, in the year you entered the employment of this\r\nChamber, it has decreased by more than thirty per cent. In this\r\nsame period the retail trade in Burden Bay has risen by almost forty\r\nper cent. I and the Chamber whose spokesman I am would appreciate an\r\nexplanation."\r\n\r\nGathering the skirts of his morning coat carefully to avoid unsightly\r\nwrinkles, the President sat down. The silence which followed his\r\nsonorous harangue could have been scooped up with a spatula. Eight\r\npairs of eyes remained fixed with suspicion upon the object of his\r\naddress.\r\n\r\nWith a sigh, Wiley Cordes got to his feet. Hands in pockets he leaned\r\nagainst the table, jingling the change and keys his fingers found. 

He\r\nwas going to have to make this good or be out of a very soft, high\r\npaying job. Fortunately, he had an idea.\r\n\r\n"When I undertook to lift your resort trade here in Wheedonville by the\r\nSea above that of Burden Bay," he began with an air of good humor that\r\ndrew no response from the grave men listening to him, "I could not, of\r\ncourse, foresee that Mrs. Quinlan in our rival metropolis was going to\r\ngive birth to quintuplets."\r\n\r\nHe paused, let it sink in. "Nor could I look into a crystal ball and\r\nlearn that Wheedonville by the Sea was going to be cursed with five\r\nstraight weeks of fog and rain at the height of the season. And it is\r\nhardly my fault that the Burden Coastal Oil Refineries should bring in\r\nfive gushers."\r\n\r\n"Granted, Cordes," said the President, speaking without arising. "But\r\nwe cannot continue indefinitely against such buffets of fortune--not\r\nand pay twenty-five thousand dollars a year for protection against ill\r\nluck--without receiving an iota of protection."\r\n\r\n"Your sentiments touch me deeply," said Cordes. "And I should not have\r\nbeen worthy of your more than generous salary if I had not studied the\r\nproblem thoroughly and come to this meeting with a plan which should\r\nspeedily put an end to the difficulties under which all of us have been\r\nlaboring."\r\n\r\nCordes paused to let this sink in. He knew, as do all talented pitch\r\nmen, when he had his audience hooked. The expression in the eight pairs\r\nof eyes upon him was still uniform--but it flashed a uniformity of hope.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen," he went on, "the summer season draws rapidly to its close.\r\nIt has not been successful. But Wheedonville by the Sea and Burden Bay\r\nhave both built their reputations as resort cities, much like that of\r\nAtlantic City, upon the warmth of climate and water in fall and spring.\r\nI propose to make Wheedonville by the Sea the only mild-weather resort\r\nin this entire section of coastline."\r\n\r\n"And just how do you propose to do this?" 

asked one of the members,\r\nhis interest aroused above his incredulity. 

In simple words Wiley\r\nCordes told them. At first there were a few protests upon humanitarian\r\ngrounds. But they were not enduring. After all the Chamber of Commerce\r\nwas a collection of hard-headed businessmen. Furthermore they were\r\nhard-pressed businessmen. 

Their ultimate approval was unanimous, as was\r\ntheir vow to mutual secrecy. There was little else they could do.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCold weather was a factor in Cordes\' scheme. But cold weather descends\r\nin occasional unseasonable snaps upon the balmiest of resort climate.\r\nEven in Florida and Texas there has been snow during recent years. For\r\nonce the luck ran for Cordes and his quasi-desperate employers.\r\n\r\nEarly upon a morning in late September, less than a week after the\r\nshowdown meeting, a plane took off, not from the Wheedonville Municipal\r\nAirport but from a private field that lurked less prosperously and\r\npublicly in the resort city\'s villa-studded suburbs.\r\n\r\nThe plane, a converted Mitchell B-25 AAF bomber, was piloted by\r\nWiley Cordes himself--aviation was among his numerous personal\r\naccomplishments. There were bombs in the bomb bay--but bombs of a type\r\nnot yet seen in war. 

Millions of pellets of dry ice were so stowed away\r\nthat they could be sowed high in the atmosphere by continued pressure\r\nupon a release trigger in the cockpit.\r\n\r\nThe cloud formations were just right--with heavy layers above the\r\ntarget area and little wind. The temperature, in the high thirties\r\nat ground level, was below zero two miles up. After getting a sight\r\nthrough the cloud strata, Wiley Cordes began to sow his snow.\r\n\r\nBack and forth he flew for the better part of an hour, bombarding the\r\nclouds with ice pellets to make snow. He had timed his flight with care\r\nso that no other plane would be aloft when he reached the sky above the\r\nrival Burden Bay resort--no others took off once the snow storm began.\r\nIncoming planes were routed to Wheedonville by the Sea.\r\n\r\nWiley Cordes listened to the reports on his radio as he flew back to\r\nthe secluded airport outside of Wheedonville. From the tenor of the\r\nannouncers it was clearly evident that no one suspected the snowstorm\r\nhad been deliberately induced by the hand of man. After taxiing his\r\nex-bomber into the hangar, he got out of flying togs and drove to the\r\nWheedonville City Club, where the members of the Chamber of Commerce\r\nwere waiting.\r\n\r\nIf the mood of their previous meeting had been glum, today joy was\r\nunconfined. Old whiskey was brought out, and a special banquet served\r\nby close-mouthed club attendants. The radio was left on, and each\r\nreport of the inexplicable snowstorm which had brought a halt to the\r\nBurden Bay autumn season was the occasion for a toast.\r\n\r\n"The man who really deserves our thanks," said the President, lifting\r\nhis glass to Wiley Cordes. A chorus of "Hear, hear" greeted his salute.\r\nWiley, entering into the spirit of the occasion, waxed enthusiastic\r\nwhen he was given the floor after cigars were passed.\r\n\r\n"It is my belief," he went on, "that by repeatedly inducing snow\r\nto fall over our neighbor city I can ultimately reduce its mean\r\ntemperature by the very emanation of cold from the snow covered ground\r\nto a point where it will remain colder than normal throughout the fall,\r\nwinter and spring.\r\n\r\n"Furthermore," he added, his well-preserved face alight with optimism,\r\n"I see no reason why we should limit ourselves to snowstorms. The same\r\ndry ice treatment, given to the right cloud formation above Burden Bay\r\nwhen opportunity offers, should produce a certain percentage of rainy\r\nweekends and holidays. I can truthfully say that our worries are over."\r\n\r\n"Keep it up, and you\'ll find a welcome surprise in your pay envelope,\r\nWiley," said the President, beaming. The arrival of the afternoon\r\npapers from Burden Bay was the signal to cease all speech making for a\r\ngood gloat.\r\n\r\nThe journalists of Wheedonville by the Sea\'s ancient rival, beneath\r\na commendable effort to gloss over the disaster, were really crying\r\ncatastrophe. Coming without warning, the baby blizzard--for it had\r\namounted almost to that--had literally caught them with their plants\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nDamage, it was hinted in stories hastily killed for later editions,\r\nwould almost certainly run high into millions. Hotel reservations for\r\nthe usually equable autumn months were already being canceled. As if to\r\nprove it never snowed but it poured, the Oil Refinery chose that day\r\nto announce the failure of a sixth gusher and resultant passing of a\r\ndividend.\r\n\r\nThree days later, when clouds again moved in on the coastline, Wiley\r\nCordes took to the air with another load of dry ice pellets. And once\r\nagain he did his dirty work undetected and with disastrous results for\r\nBurden Bay.\r\n\r\nOn his third trip, because of a low current of warm air of whose\r\nexistence he was not informed, Wiley came in with a rain storm that\r\nwashed away most of the snow. But his fourth, fifth and sixth one-plane\r\nraids more than made up for this lapse.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWiley Cordes and Wheedonville by the Sea were riding high. Hotels were\r\npacked and concessions were booming. The public relations expert found\r\nhis salary raised an added hundred dollars a week. There was laughter\r\nat a Chamber meeting over a Burden Bay picture release showing a couple\r\nof pretty girls in ski clothes backed by a slide made of the defunct\r\noil gushers.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll get the chorus of Mike Todd\'s new musical down here next weekend\r\nand put them on water skis in bathing suits," promised the laughing\r\nWiley Cordes. Of course he knew it could not last forever. 

But he saw\r\nno reason for the run of good fortune to come to an early end. He had\r\nplanned and executed his scheme too well.\r\n\r\nSo he was not pleased to discover another plane above the clouds on his\r\nnext trip over Burden Bay. Still, it was something that had to happen.\r\nHe merely cruised on innocently and was relieved when the other ship--a\r\nbig four-motored flying boxcar--disappeared through the clouds. Then he\r\nswung back and did his stuff.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: There was another plane above the clouds over Burden\r\nBay.]\r\n\r\nHe saw the plane on three more occasions as he placed snowstorms\r\naccurately over hapless Burden Bay and its presence began to worry him.\r\nBut the pilot gave no indication that he knew what Wiley was up to and\r\nthe discreet young public relations counsellor decided not to mention\r\nit to the men who were backing his scheme.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this step and of his own pre-occupation with promoting\r\nthe balmy atmosphere of Wheedonville by the Sea, he was really caught\r\noff-guard when disaster finally struck. As fall merged into winter the\r\nreservations totals for Wheedonville hotels fell off far more sharply\r\nthan it should have--especially with Burden Bay out of the picture.\r\n\r\nIt was the President of the Chamber of Commerce who broke the news to\r\nWiley Cordes, after summoning him to his office in early December.\r\nThere he simply tossed a telegram at his high powered promoter. No\r\nwords were needed to explain his mood--it was evident enough from the\r\njut of his beetling gray brows and the bayonet-angle of his Corona\r\nCorona.\r\n\r\n"Read this," he said laconically. "Read it and pack."\r\n\r\nStartled, Wiley complied, felt himself go gray and sick and shaky as he\r\nscanned the contents of the wire.\r\n\r\nIt read:\r\n\r\n    TO CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WHEEDONVILLE BY THE SEA THANK YOU STOP\r\n    ESPECIAL THANKS TO WILEY CORDES FOR TRIPLING OUR OFF-SEASON RESORT\r\n    TRADE STOP HIS SNOWMAKING FLIGHTS NO LONGER NEEDED STOP WE HAVE\r\n    ADOPTED IDEA OURSELVES STOP ONCE AGAIN THANKS FROM THE ONLY SKI\r\n    RESORT ON THE COAST STOP COME AND TRY OUR NEW RUNS AT OUR EXPENSE\r\n    AS SMALL RETURN FOR YOUR FAVOR STOP BURDEN BAY CHAMBER OF COMMERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\n"Moon in 14\xc2\xb0 Pisces," said the little perforated card. Henderson\r\nstepped back from the computer and scratched his hairy head. 

Nonsense\r\nagain. He threw the card in the wastebasket and repeated his directions\r\non another:\r\n\r\n"One hundred fifty cancer susceptible mice were injected in the\r\npectoral region with 1/cc of aromatic compound A. One hundred fifty\r\nidentical control mice were injected with isotonic saline, B. Eight in\r\ngroup A developed sarcomas at the point of injection, Group B developed\r\nnone. Test the null hypothesis at 5% level of statistical significance."\r\n\r\nThe computer accepted Henderson\'s second offering, chewed it\r\ninto acceptable code, swallowed it, and burped. Henderson watched\r\nsuspiciously as red and green blinkers went on and off and a contented\r\nhumming noise came from the machine\'s bowels. After a while the card\r\nemerged from another opening--which orifice had been thoughtfully\r\nplaced at the appropriate end of the machine, anatomically speaking;\r\nthus establishing rapport between Henderson, a biologist, and nature\'s\r\nfinal product of evolution, the machine.\r\n\r\nHenderson looked at the card: "Today you should seek solace with close\r\nfriends. Give some thought to personal finances. 

Evening: get out and\r\nsee people. 

A stranger will bring news."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHenderson crumpled the card and tossed it in the wastebasket. He sat\r\ndown, and with a little arithmetic and some formulas tested the null\r\nhypothesis all by himself. He found that his mouse experiment carried\r\nno significance whatever. Then he made a notation that someone would\r\nhave to come out in the morning for his sick machine.\r\n\r\nIn the morning when the machine\'s doctor came to inspect it, and\r\npercuss it, and auscult it, and give it a barium enema, it behaved very\r\nwell. The "doctor" left, assuring Henderson the machine merely had the\r\nhiccups. That night Henderson asked it a question about confidence\r\nlimits for a universe mean, from a mean of a sample of _n_ observations\r\nand got back, "Uranus on Antares but conjoining Jupiter and trining the\r\nAscendent. Yours is a strongly literary nature.

"\r\n\r\nHenderson decided to turn the machine off for a few days. It emitted an\r\nalmost human sigh as it ran down and came to a halt.\r\n\r\nHe had no immediate use for it as he would be injecting mice with\r\ncarcinogens in liver, spleen, marrow and kidneys to find out if they\r\nwere specific. In three or four days whatever virus was affecting\r\nthe machine\'s cerebral cortex should have run its course and the\r\nmethodical Henderson could run his methodical observations into the\r\nmachine, which would excrete a good methodical answer to be duly filed\r\nin the medical school library, where it would be invisible to anyone\r\nlooking for it, such as freshmen medical students, and always in the\r\nway for anybody else.\r\n\r\nHenderson surveyed his laboratory with infinite pleasure, knowing\r\nthat it contained within its confines all that could be known about\r\nthe universe, about men and about mice. Event Y followed event X in a\r\npurely causal manner. The successful investigator needed only to attach\r\nhimself to the cycle and ride along, afterwards consulting the computer\r\nto find out if what he\'d observed had any significance.\r\n\r\nIn the morning when Henderson entered the laboratory he found that\r\nsomeone had left the computer on over-night.\r\n\r\nIt was running full blast, which is to say the lights were blinking and\r\nthe little cards of omniscience were popping out of the machine like\r\ntoast and falling into the wastebasket, which is just where Henderson\r\nleft them. Meanwhile, Dr. Henderson\'s close associate, Colonel Smith\r\nin the nearby radiation laboratory, came in to visit him and asked\r\npermission to use the computer.\r\n\r\nAnd so in another week it was rumored about that the machine in\r\nHenderson\'s laboratory was using a foreign dialect and answering\r\nquestions about standard deviation with strange symbols which looked\r\nlike crescent moons and archaic squiggles, with a little geometry on\r\nthe side.\r\n\r\nThe machine was becoming impudent too. To Colonel Smith\'s question\r\nabout the possibility of an "overkill" if such and such size bomb\r\ndropped on such and such enemy city the answer came back, "Rubbish.\r\nAldebaran conjoining Saturn, Moon and Mars. Seek guidance from\r\nothers, Hannibal blushed." The machine\'s doctor promptly installed a\r\nloudspeaker to help keep track of future aberrations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat night the janitor walked in. He was a balding Greek gentleman,\r\ndedicated to a life with brush and dustpan. The machine was muttering\r\ndarkly to itself, but when he entered the door it quieted down,\r\ncontemplating its relays.\r\n\r\nThe janitor went meticulously about his business, mopping the floor,\r\nstraightening chairs and secretly rearranging pipette and retorts in\r\ntheir racks, because he was a more meticulous person than even Dr.\r\nHenderson. As he turned to leave, the machine in the corner belched\r\ntwice and then said as an afterthought:\r\n\r\n"I am the ghost of Astrologers Sagittarian."\r\n\r\nThe janitor adjusted his hearing aid, squeezed his mop and carried his\r\npail out the door. As he went back in to pack up his cleaning powder\r\nand brushes, the machine said, "What year is this? Limits within\r\nstandard deviation, click, click, awrk!"\r\n\r\nThe janitor was a reasonable man. He walked over to the machine\'s\r\nmicrophone and told it what year it was as well as the month, day and\r\nhour. Then he carried his brushes and cleaning compound out of the room\r\nand locked the door.\r\n\r\nBut the janitor\'s night was a long one. At midnight, when he finished\r\ntwo floors and only had three more to go, he took his coffee break. As\r\nhe talked with his old friend Samuel, the night watchman, he fell to\r\nthinking. That was an unforgivable mistake. 

After the coffee break,\r\nthey both went back up to Dr. Henderson\'s laboratory and listened to\r\nthe machine talking to itself.\r\n\r\n"I feel like a spider," said the machine. "Nonsense. 

From one cobweb\r\nto another. Must settle down and build a grau ... spltvbk ... within\r\n95% confidence limits. Nova in Andromeda was bad enough. 

Now this. One\r\nhundred fifty cancer susceptible mice inherit the Earth."\r\n\r\nSuddenly the machine fell silent, sensing it had visitors. The night\r\nwatchman reached into the wastebasket and pulled out one of the\r\nmachine\'s cards.\r\n\r\n"Aldebaran is martial in nature, in the ninth degree of Tropical\r\nGemini," it said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"I\'m a Gemini!" exclaimed the janitor, surprised to see anything\r\nfamiliar come out of the machine. "Birthday is May 25."\r\n\r\n"Wonderful!" cried the machine. "First intelligent man I\'ve heard so\r\nfar. Gemini is justly famed as the owner of a quick mind and ready wit.\r\nYour intellectual achievements are a splendid asset to your literary\r\ninclinations."\r\n\r\nThe janitor, embarrassed at the sudden praise, shifted his broom from\r\none hand to the other. The machine continued.\r\n\r\n"I need an Ephemeris," said the machine. "Can you find an Ephemeris?\r\nI need one desperately!" and the machine\'s desperate need for an\r\nEphemeris so shook its intestines, liver and gallbladder that its tone\r\nof voice came out a minor third above the normal monotonous dirge of\r\nthe loudspeaker.\r\n\r\n"An E-what-eris?" said the janitor.\r\n\r\n"An Ephemeris," repeated the machine. "An astronomical almanac.\r\nSomething that tells me where Mars is. There I was, on my way over from\r\nthe clouds of Magellan to visit friends in Orion when Whammo! Mars\r\ncomes into conjunction with Uranus. When something that _big_ happens\r\nI just sit down and wait. Here I am now in this absurd device. Do you\r\nsuppose you could look out the window and tell me where Mars is?"\r\n\r\nThe night watchman said, "It\'s cloudy outside."\r\n\r\n"See!" said the machine, "When Mars goes on the war-path _nothing_\r\ncomes out right. Now, Gemini, if you will just go down to the library\r\nand get me an Ephemeris for this year we can clear this up and I\'ll be\r\non my way, indebted to you for life, if not longer."\r\n\r\n"Who shall I say it\'s for?" asked the janitor, who did not fully\r\nunderstand that the library was public, never having been in it before,\r\nand felt he needed a recommendation or a slip of approval.\r\n\r\n"Just say it\'s for Pyet, the astrologer," said the machine.\r\n\r\n"And what are you doing inside Dr. Henderson\'s machine?" asked the\r\nnight watchman.\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t care to be quoted on this," replied the machine, "but\r\nactually any system of communicating inter-related events with a high\r\ndegree of complexity, such as the brain, or this machine, and with some\r\nnumber of critical processes at the quantum statistical level, can\r\nsupport consciousness."\r\n\r\nThe janitor and the night watchman looked blankly at each other and the\r\nmachine, slightly embarrassed, added by way of explanation.\r\n\r\n"I like to read a little physics now and then. A harmless superstition\r\ncontaining many pleasant diversions.\r\n\r\n"Before this I lived in a star, a puff of expanding gas. Before that in\r\na haunted house ... dreadful. 

And before that in the lopsided blob of\r\nprotoplasm that was the last of Pyet, the astrologer.\r\n\r\n"As for Dr. Henderson\'s mousecatcher," chuckled the machine, "any port\r\nin a storm. Mars and Uranus you know."\r\n\r\nThe janitor was somewhat impatient with the machine. It had detained\r\nhim already and probably would soon be giving him orders.\r\n\r\n"I still have three floors to clean," said the janitor. "After that I\r\nwill see if the library downstairs has a ... what was it?"\r\n\r\n"Ephemeris," said the machine. "E-P-H-E M-E-R-I-S. 

Thank you."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd so the night watchman and the janitor both said good night to the\r\nmachine. Later, in the very early morning, the janitor stole back into\r\nthe laboratory with a book and read some strange, strange things out\r\nloud and then stole out of the room again and locked the door behind\r\nhim. Shortly after, Samuel, the night watchman, passed by.\r\n\r\nHe was surprised at an unearthly glow coming from within and a peculiar\r\ngrating noise as if someone were stepping on a radio. Then the\r\nunearthly glow appeared on the fire escape and Samuel, rushing out to\r\nobserve, thought the glow seemed to fly up through a hole in the low\r\nclouds where a thousand stars still blazed brightly. In its wake there\r\nwas a sound like laughing.\r\n\r\nA few hours later Dr. Henderson unlocked the door of his laboratory and\r\npushed a cart full of mice in before him.\r\n\r\nDuring the morning he dissected three hundred mice, popping out liver,\r\nspleen and kidneys as if he were shelling peas. In the afternoon he\r\nmade sections of the organs, stained them with hematoxylin and eosin,\r\nmounted them on slides and looked at them under his new stereoscopic\r\nmicroscope. Five minutes before five, Dr. Henderson\'s friend, Colonel\r\nSmith, came in and watched as Henderson somewhat dubiously fed the\r\nthree hundred mice, now in statistical form, into the machine. The\r\nmachine whirred efficiently and shot out the answer in seconds.\r\n\r\n"Statistically significant," said the machine.\r\n\r\nHenderson followed his friend Colonel Smith out the door, looking\r\nneither right nor left, and locked it behind him. It had been a good\r\nday.\r\n\r\nBehind, in the laboratory which contained within its confines all that\r\ncould be known about the universe, about man, and about mice, the\r\nmachine squatted in silence, the approaching darkness already enfolding\r\nit like a shroud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Would it work? Yes. How would\r\n                   it work? Exactly  like  this.\r\n\r\n\r\n"No more lies," Paula said. "For God\'s sake, Doctor, no more lies. I\'ve\r\nbeen living with lies for the past year and I\'m tired of them."\r\n\r\nBernstein closed the white door before answering, mercifully obscuring\r\nthe sheeted, motionless mound on the hospital bed. He took the young\r\nwoman\'s elbow and walked with her down the tiled corridor.\r\n\r\n"He\'s dying, of course," he said conversationally. "We\'ve never lied to\r\nyou about that, Mrs. Hills; you know what we\'ve told you all along. I\r\nhoped that by now you\'d feel more resigned."\r\n\r\n"I was," she said bitterly. They had stopped in front of Bernstein\'s\r\nsmall office and she drew her arm away. "But then you called me. 

About\r\nthis drug of yours--"\r\n\r\n"We had to call you. Senopoline can\'t be administered without\r\npermission of the patient, and since your husband has been in coma for\r\nthe last four days--"\r\n\r\nHe opened the door and nodded her inside. She hesitated, then walked\r\nin. He took his place behind the cluttered desk, his grave face\r\ndistracted, and waited until she sat down in the facing chair. He\r\npicked up his telephone receiver, replaced it, shuffled papers, and\r\nthen locked his hands on the desk blotter.\r\n\r\n"Senopoline is a curious drug," he said. "I\'ve had little experience\r\nwith it myself. 

You may have heard about the controversy surrounding\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"No," she whispered. "I don\'t know about it. I haven\'t cared about\r\nanything since Andy\'s illness."\r\n\r\n"At any rate, you\'re the only person in the world that can decide\r\nwhether your husband receives it. It\'s strange stuff, as I said, but in\r\nthe light of your husband\'s present condition, I can tell you this--it\r\ncan do him absolutely no harm."\r\n\r\n"But it will do him good?"\r\n\r\n"There," Bernstein sighed, "is the crux of the controversy, Mrs.\r\nHills."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRow, row, row your boat, he sang in his mind, feeling the lapping\r\ntongues of the cool lake water against his fingers, drifting, drifting,\r\nunder obeisant willows. Paula\'s hands were resting gently on his eyes\r\nand he lifted them away. Then he kissed the soft palms and pressed them\r\non his cheek. When he opened his eyes, he was surprised to find that\r\nthe boat was a bed, the water only pelting rain against the window, and\r\nthe willow trees long shadows on the walls. Only Paula\'s hands were\r\nreal, solid and real and comforting against his face.\r\n\r\nHe grinned at her. "Funniest damn thing," he said. "For a minute there,\r\nI thought we were back at Finger Lake. Remember that night we sprang a\r\nleak? I\'ll never forget the way you looked when you saw the hem of your\r\ndress."\r\n\r\n"Andy," she said quietly. "Andy, do you know what\'s happened?"\r\n\r\nHe scratched his head. "Seems to me Doc Bernstein was in here a while\r\nago. Or was he? 

Didn\'t they jab me again or something?"\r\n\r\n"It was a drug, Andy. Don\'t you remember? They have this new miracle\r\ndrug, senopoline. Dr. 

Bernstein told you about it, said it was worth\r\nthe try...."\r\n\r\n"Oh, sure, I remember."\r\n\r\nHe sat up in bed, casually, as if sitting up in bed were an everyday\r\noccurrence. He took a cigarette from the table beside him and lit one.\r\nHe smoked reflectively for a moment, and then recalled that he hadn\'t\r\nbeen anything but horizontal for almost eight months. Swiftly, he put\r\nhis hand on his rib cage and touched the firm flesh.\r\n\r\n"The girdle," he said wonderingly. "Where the hell\'s the girdle?"\r\n\r\n"They took it off," Paula said tearfully. "Oh, Andy, they took it off.\r\nYou don\'t need it any more. You\'re healed, completely healed. 

It\'s a\r\nmiracle!"\r\n\r\n"A miracle...."\r\n\r\nShe threw her arms about him; they hadn\'t held each other since the\r\naccident a year ago, the accident that had snapped his spine in several\r\nplaces. He had been twenty-two when it happened.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey released him from the hospital three days later; after half a year\r\nin the hushed white world, the city outside seemed wildly clamorous and\r\nriotously colorful, like a town at the height of carnival. He had never\r\nfelt so well in his life; he was eager to put the strong springs of\r\nhis muscles back into play. Bernstein had made the usual speech about\r\nrest, but a week after his discharge Andy and Paula were at the courts\r\nin tennis clothes.\r\n\r\nAndy had always been a dedicated player, but his stiff-armed forehand\r\nand poor net game had always prevented him from being anything more\r\nthan a passable amateur. Now he was a demon on the court, no ball\r\nescaping his swift-moving racket. He astounded himself with the\r\naccuracy of his crashing serves, his incredible play at the net.\r\n\r\nPaula, a junior champion during her college years, couldn\'t begin to\r\ncope with him; laughingly, she gave up and watched him battle the club\r\nprofessional. He took the first set 6-0, 6-0, 6-0, and Andy knew that\r\nsomething more magical than medicinal had happened to him.\r\n\r\nThey talked it over, excited as schoolchildren, all the way home. Andy,\r\nwho had taken a job in a stock-brokerage house after college, and who\r\nhad been bored silly with the whole business until the accident, began\r\nwondering if he could make a career on the tennis court.\r\n\r\nTo make sure his superb playing wasn\'t a fluke, they returned to the\r\nclub the next day. This time, Andy found a former Davis Cup challenger\r\nto compete with. At the end of the afternoon, his heart pounding to\r\nthe beat of victory, he knew it was true.\r\n\r\nThat night, with Paula in his lap, he stroked her long auburn hair and\r\nsaid: "No, Paula, it\'s all wrong. I\'d like to keep it up, maybe enter\r\nthe Nationals, but that\'s no life for me. 

It\'s only a game, after all."\r\n\r\n"Only a game?" she said mockingly. "That\'s a fine thing for the next\r\ntop-seeded man to say."\r\n\r\n"No, I\'m serious. Oh, I don\'t mean I intend to stay in Wall Street;\r\nthat\'s not my ambition either. As a matter of fact, I was thinking of\r\npainting again."\r\n\r\n"Painting? You haven\'t painted since your freshman year. You think you\r\ncan make a living at it?"\r\n\r\n"I was always pretty good, you know that. I\'d like to try doing some\r\ncommercial illustration; that\'s for the bread and potatoes. Then, when\r\nwe don\'t have to worry about creditors, I\'d like to do some things on\r\nmy own.

"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t pull a Gauguin on me, friend." 

She kissed his cheek lightly.\r\n"Don\'t desert your wife and family for some Tahitian idyll...."\r\n\r\n"What family?"\r\n\r\nShe pulled away from him and got up to stir the ashes in the fireplace.\r\nWhen she returned, her face was glowing with the heat of the fire and\r\nwarmth of her news.\r\n\r\nAndrew Hills, Junior, was born in September. Two years later, little\r\nDenise took over the hand-me-down cradle. By that time, Andy Hills was\r\nsigning his name to the magazine covers of America\'s top-circulation\r\nweeklies, and they were happy to feature it. His added fame as\r\nAmerica\'s top-ranked amateur tennis champion made the signature all the\r\nmore desirable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Andrew Junior was three, Andrew Senior made his most important\r\nadvance in the field of art--not on the cover of the _Saturday Evening\r\nPost_, but in the halls of the Modern Museum of Art. His first exhibit\r\nevoked such a torrent of superlatives that the _New York Times_ found\r\nthe reaction newsworthy enough for a box on the front page. There was\r\na celebration in the Hills household that night, attended by their\r\nclosest friends: copies of slick magazines were ceremoniously burned\r\nand the ashes placed in a dime-store urn that Paula had bought for the\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nA month later, they were signing the documents that entitled them to a\r\nsprawling hilltop house in Westchester, with a north-light glassed-in\r\nstudio the size of their former apartment.\r\n\r\nHe was thirty-five when the urge struck him to rectify a sordid\r\npolitical situation in their town. His fame as an artist and\r\ntennis-champion (even at thirty-five, he was top-seeded in the\r\nNationals) gave him an easy entree into the political melee. At first,\r\nthe idea of vote-seeking appalled him; but he couldn\'t retreat once the\r\nmovement started. He won easily and was elected to the town council.\r\nThe office was a minor one, but he was enough of a celebrity to attract\r\ncountry-wide attention. During the following year, he began to receive\r\nvisits from important men in party circles; in the next state election,\r\nhis name was on the ballot. By the time he was forty, Andrew Hills was\r\na U.S. Senator.\r\n\r\nThat spring, he and Paula spent a month in Acapulco, in an enchanting\r\nhome they had erected in the cool shadows of the steep mountains that\r\nfaced the bay. It was there that Andy talked about his future.\r\n\r\n"I know what the party\'s planning," he told his wife, "but I know\r\nthey\'re wrong. I\'m not Presidential timber, Paula."\r\n\r\nBut the decision wasn\'t necessary; by summer, the Asiatic Alliance had\r\ntired of the incessant talks with the peacemakers and had launched\r\ntheir attack on the Alaskan frontier. Andy was commissioned at once as\r\na major.\r\n\r\nHis gallantry in action, his brilliant recapture of Shaktolik, White\r\nMountain, and eventual triumphant march into Nome guaranteed him a\r\nplace in the High Command of the Allied Armies.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the first year of fighting, there were two silver stars\r\non his shoulder and he was given the most critical assignment of\r\nall--to represent the Allies in the negotiations that were taking place\r\nin Fox Island in the Aleutians. Later, he denied that he was solely\r\nresponsible for the successful culmination of the peace talks, but\r\nthe American populace thought him hero enough to sweep him into the\r\nWhite House the following year in a landslide victory unparalleled in\r\npolitical history.\r\n\r\nHe was fifty by the time he left Washington, but his greatest triumphs\r\nwere yet to come. In his second term, his interest in the World\r\nOrganization had given him a major role in world politics. As First\r\nSecretary of the World Council, his ability to effect a working\r\ncompromise between the ideological factions was directly responsible\r\nfor the establishment of the World Government.\r\n\r\nWhen he was sixty-four, Andrew Hills was elected World President, and\r\nhe held the office until his voluntary retirement at seventy-five.\r\nStill active and vigorous, still capable of a commanding tennis game,\r\nof a painting that set art circles gasping, he and Paula moved\r\npermanently into the house in Acapulco.\r\n\r\nHe was ninety-six when the fatigue of living overtook him. Andrew\r\nJunior, with his four grandchildren, and Denise, with her charming\r\ntwins, paid him one last visit before he took to his bed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"But what _is_ the stuff?" 

Paula said. 

"Does it cure or what? I have a\r\nright to know!"\r\n\r\nDr. Bernstein frowned. "It\'s rather hard to describe. It has no\r\ncurative powers. It\'s more in the nature of a hypnotic drug, but it has\r\na rather peculiar effect. It provokes a dream."\r\n\r\n"A dream?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. An incredibly long and detailed dream, in which the patient lives\r\nan entire lifetime, and lives it just the way he would like it to be.\r\nYou might say it\'s an opiate, but the most humane one ever developed."\r\n\r\nPaula looked down at the still figure on the bed. His hand was moving\r\nslowly across the bed-sheet, the fingers groping toward her.\r\n\r\n"Andy," she breathed. "Andy darling...."\r\n\r\nHis hand fell across hers, the touch feeble and aged.\r\n\r\n"Paula," he whispered, "say good-by to the children for me."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\nHis first day on Earth promised to be even worse than Mirrh Yahn y\r\nCona had feared when he left Yrml Orise y Yrl, his fiancee, to become\r\nMars\' first interplanetary ambassador. The frenetic bustle of Denver\r\nspaceport, his ominous spiriting away through screaming hordes of\r\nspectators, left him bewildered and uneasy.\r\n\r\nAlone in the first brief privacy of his Denver Heptagon apartment, he\r\nideographed a facsimile transmission to Yrml at once. "I long for you\r\nalready," he said. 

"And for the serenity of home. Earthpeople are as\r\nbarbarous and mercurial as their weather."\r\n\r\nBabelous decades of taped newsreels and video serials should have\r\nprepared him for that inconstancy, but the first-hand reality was\r\nappalling. He would gladly have returned home at once, before planetary\r\nconjunction\'s end cut him off for two interminable years, but for the\r\ninevitable stumbling-block: Earth had sent an exchange of her own, and\r\nMirrh Yahn y Cona could not back down without disgracing his planet as\r\nwell as himself.\r\n\r\n"Write often," he pleaded, in closing. "That I may take comfort in your\r\nsteadfast regard even in this simian hurlyburly."\r\n\r\nThe missive finished, he found time remaining before Ellis, of\r\nDiplomatic, arrived to switch on the multisensory projection of his\r\nlast evening with Yrml. The projection had been cubed in a Privileged\r\nCouples nook complete with real plants and hermetically sealed\r\nfountain, and near its close the two of them had sung the traditional\r\nSong of Parting from the ancient _Tchulkione Serafi_.\r\n\r\nEllis arrived all too soon, trailing an aura of Scotch, diplomatic\r\nenthusiasm and geniality.\r\n\r\n"No time to waste," Ellis said briskly. "Little enough of it before you\r\nleave us, and you\'re going to see Earth from pole to pole. The three of\r\nus begin this evening with a sample of Denver night life."\r\n\r\n"Three?"\r\n\r\n"Came early to brief you," Ellis said. 

"Found a guide for you. Can\'t\r\nrun about unescorted, you know."\r\n\r\nHe answered the door buzzer and admitted a young woman in evening\r\ndress. Rushed from the spaceport in what amounted to cloak-and-dagger\r\nsecrecy, Mirrh Yahn y Cona had until now seen Earthwomen only on video\r\nand at indistinguishable distance, and the sudden appearance of this\r\none in the flesh unnerved him completely.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe girl was small and slender, well under Mirrh Yahn y Cona\'s athletic\r\nsix-foot height. She was warmly and roundly vital with a stunning\r\nabundance of life at which the two-dimensional simulacra of recorded\r\nsoap-opera could only hint.\r\n\r\n"Miss Leila Anderson," Ellis introduced her. "Member of Diplomatic, so\r\nit\'s all in the family."\r\n\r\nShe took the hand that Mirrh Yahn y Cona raised as if to defend himself.\r\n\r\n"I\'m to see that you aren\'t bored to death here among strangers," she\r\nsaid. "All work and no play isn\'t good for anyone. Especially," she\r\nsaid to Ellis, "for one so handsome. I didn\'t dream he\'d look so--"\r\n\r\n"So Terran," Ellis finished before she could say _so human_. "And why\r\nnot? 

We\'re from the same original stock, separated ages before our\r\nhistory begins. Martian annals run back for millennia, did you know?\r\nGold mine of information, settle problems our experts have puzzled over\r\nfor centuries."\r\n\r\n"I am not truly representative of my people," Mirrh Yahn y Cona said\r\nwith some bitterness. 

"A special case, reared from birth for this\r\nassignment."\r\n\r\nThe multisensory projector swung into the _Tchulkione Serafi\'s_ Song of\r\nParting. Mirrh Yahn y Cona\'s resonant baritone, operatically assertive\r\nabove Yrml\'s reedy soprano, filled the room. He shut off the machine\r\nabruptly, feeling a sense of desecration that the tender scene had been\r\nbared to alien eyes.\r\n\r\nStill he felt a puzzling premonitory twinge of guilt when the\r\nprojection collapsed. Yrml had been infinitely desirable when the\r\nsequence was cubed; why should she now seem so sallow and angular, so\r\nsuddenly and subtly distant?\r\n\r\n"Remarkable voice," Ellis said. "You could make a fortune with it\r\nhere."\r\n\r\n"It was lovely," Leila Anderson said. "Could I hear the rest of it some\r\ntime?"\r\n\r\n"No." He realized his curtness and added, "It is the Song of Parting\r\nfor lovers. Very personal."\r\n\r\nHe found that he was still holding Leila\'s hand, and dropped it\r\nhastily. Ellis, who had risen high in Diplomatic for good reasons,\r\nstepped competently into the breach.\r\n\r\n"Night duty calls," Ellis said. "Let\'s be off."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA diplomatic limousine without insignia took them to a nightclub large\r\nenough, and dim enough, to promise anonymity. On the way a quick summer\r\nshower left the streets wet and glistening and turned the night into a\r\nmany-scented freshness that was sheer fantasy to one accustomed to the\r\nsterile air of sealed underground ways.\r\n\r\nThe rain had ended when they left the car, but the brief moment\r\noutside, under a vast openness of night sky empty except for dispersing\r\nclouds and speeding white moon, struck Mirrh Yahn y Cona suddenly cold\r\nwith too-familiar panic.\r\n\r\nThey had found their table before anyone spoke.\r\n\r\n"Agoraphobia?" Ellis said, in frowning concern. 

"I should think you\'d\r\nbe conditioned against that, with all the time they\'ve had to prepare\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nLeila Anderson put an impulsive hand on the Martian\'s.\r\n\r\n"I\'m a touch claustrophobic, so I know how it must be." She shivered.\r\n"To be buried under all those tons and tons of--"\r\n\r\n"Immurement is security," Mirrh Yahn y Cona said. "The ultimate\r\nstability."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll get acclimatized," Ellis said. "It takes time."\r\n\r\nHe broke off to peer through the gloom beyond the dance floor. "Good\r\nLord, there\'s Ryerson of the _Post_, camera and all. If he recognizes\r\nme he\'ll know who Mirrh is and--"\r\n\r\n"Yahn," Mirrh Yahn y Cona corrected automatically. "With us the second\r\nname is impersonal. First is used only by loved ones."\r\n\r\n"Yahn, then," Ellis said. "If Ryerson tumbles, he\'ll want pictures and\r\nan interview. Yahn will be lionized before he\'s ready. Can\'t publicize\r\nhim until he knows the ropes."\r\n\r\n"You\'d better skip," Leila said. "If we all go, he\'ll spot us for sure."\r\n\r\n"Right." Ellis shoved some money at Leila. "Call me at my office when\r\nit\'s safe."\r\n\r\nWhen Ellis had gone and their waiter had brought drinks, they faced\r\neach other across the table, Yahn visibly on guard and Leila with the\r\nbeginning of speculation in her eyes.\r\n\r\n"Maybe it\'s better like this, without protocol," she said. "Yahn, can\r\nyou--do you dance in our gravity?"\r\n\r\nHe was bitter again. "Remember my training. I am taller, stronger and\r\nmore freakishly agile than any Martian--including my fiancee--has been\r\nfor thousands of years."\r\n\r\nHer clear look made him ashamed and he added, "With us the dance is an\r\nart form only. Here the intent seems different."\r\n\r\n"It is," Leila said almost grimly. "Finish your drink, Buster. You\'re\r\ngoing to need it.

"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe needed several before the evening was finished. The Terran dance in\r\nits limited variations offered small challenge; Yahn mastered it with\r\nan ease that delighted Leila and brought tacit envy from other couples.\r\nThe cocktails may have contributed to his own mixed reactions, lending\r\nprimitive tactility to Leila\'s pliant response.\r\n\r\nNeither of them, when Ryerson of the _Post_ went away with his camera,\r\nconsidered calling Ellis.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t often enjoy my work so much," Leila said. "Let\'s not spoil the\r\nevening with diplomacy, shall we?"\r\n\r\nThey left the Diplomatic vehicle for Ellis, rented an agency car and\r\ndrove through the charged serenity of the night into the mountains.\r\nThey talked the Moon down and the Sun up. Nothing took place that might\r\nhave shocked a reasonably tolerant duenna, but by dawn they had reached\r\nthe sort of understanding that comes spontaneously or not at all.\r\n\r\n"The biologists who tailored me to Terrestrial standards," Yahn said,\r\n"did their work too well. I find myself more Terran than Martian."\r\n\r\nThe immovable obstacle, of course, was Yahn\'s obligation to Yrml,\r\nwho would be waiting with enduring Martian patience for his return.\r\nLeila went into that matter later with Ellis, not so much to enlist\r\nhis dubious sympathies as to clarify the bristly problem in her own\r\ntroubled mind.\r\n\r\n"Martians use our broadcasts as a standard of judgment," Leila said.\r\n"And you know where _that_ leads. The more prominent the people in\r\nthe newscasts, the higher the divorce rate. The more popular a video\r\nserial, the greater its emotional shilly-shallying. To Martians we\'re\r\nthe last word in fickleness."\r\n\r\n"I know," Ellis agreed. "Our cultural geometry was always triangular."\r\n\r\n"Exactly. So how can Mirrh-Yahn break the news to his dry little\r\nfiancee back home? We\'re accustomed to inconstancy and to incontinence.\r\nWe sing corny songs about girls who write jilting letters to their men\r\nin service. Our opera flaunts Perkinses and Mesdames Butterfly, and\r\nthe fact that we enjoy them shocks the ascetic pants off the Martians.\r\nDid you know that their population control quota demands a strictly\r\nequal sex-ratio, so that there\'s never more than one boy for one girl\r\nfrom the beginning? Mirrh-Yahn simply hasn\'t it in him to leave Yrml\r\ndangling. 

He\'d feel a renegade for the rest of his life."\r\n\r\n"_Mirrh_-Yahn," Ellis noted. "Obviously he\'s willing enough, if you\'re\r\non a first-name footing."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t call him Yahn any longer, like a stranger. Mirrh-Yahn is a\r\ncompromise."\r\n\r\nEllis rummaged in his desk and brought out a personnel folder. "Dossier\r\non J. Frederic Thomas, our young man on Mars. Maybe we can turn up an\r\nangle through him."\r\n\r\nThe exchange ambassador\'s folder was neither interesting nor helpful.\r\nJ. Frederic Thomas stood revealed as a dwarfish scholastic type,\r\ncomplete with massive glasses and receding hairline.\r\n\r\n"He looks more Martian than Terran," Leila said. "Is that deliberate?"\r\n\r\n"Mars sent us a man specially bred to fit into our culture, didn\'t\r\nthey? Simple job here to turn up a Martian type. Matter of fact, J.\r\nF.\'s reports show he fits in up there like a native."\r\n\r\n"Check with him, then," Leila said. "Though I can\'t imagine what help\r\nwe can expect from a wizened little stick like that.

"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLeila was wrong. J. Frederic Thomas--who quite predictably, being\r\npaired off with the only unattached female on Mars as his cicerone,\r\nhad immediately found himself caught in the same thorny dilemma that\r\ngouged his opposite number on Earth--was eager to help. The result of\r\nEllis\' inquiry was a swift letter from Yrml Orise y Yrl to Mirrh Yahn\r\ny Cona; a letter which Ellis turned over in duplicate, one in Martian\r\nideograph, the other a translation, to Leila.\r\n\r\nIt broke Yrml\'s engagement to Yahn for the excellent reasons that J.\r\nFrederic Thomas was not only more Martian in physique and deportment,\r\nbut also possessed a fine reedy tenor which blended ever so better with\r\nYrml\'s soprano in the less poignant duets from the _Tchulkione Serafi_.\r\n\r\n"The man never lived," Ellis pointed out, "Martian or Terran, no matter\r\nhow relieved he might be, whose ego wouldn\'t need attention after a\r\nletter beginning _Dear Yahn_. Shall I let it go on through the mails,\r\nor will you--"\r\n\r\nLeila answered him on her way out. 

"Don\'t bother," she said.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


"\r\n\r\n"Bill Stephens."\r\n\r\n"To see H. Joshua Blair. We have an appointment."\r\n\r\n"It\'s for three-thirty. We called up two weeks ago."\r\n\r\nThe secretary said, "Oh, yes. I have you on the list." She checked them\r\noff, studied them vaguely, asked, "What was it you wanted to see Mr.\r\nBlair about?"\r\n\r\nTed Baker held out the small steel box he was carrying. "About this."\r\n\r\n"Ah--what is it?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s a box."\r\n\r\n"I can see that," the redhead snapped. "What is it for? 

What does it\r\ndo?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s for construction work. It makes holes."\r\n\r\nThe girl sighed. It was late in the day and she didn\'t care much,\r\nreally. She snapped an intercom button. An inquiring voice rasped at\r\nher. She said, "A Mr. Baker and a Mr. 

Stephens to see you."\r\n\r\nEvidently it was all right because she snapped off the button and\r\npointed to a door. "In there."\r\n\r\nThey went in the door and faced a desk large enough to play tennis on.\r\nThe man behind the desk gave them a cordial snarl. "Well, what have you\r\ngot on your mind? And don\'t take all day to tell me."\r\n\r\nTed extended the box. "This. We\'d like to sell it to you."\r\n\r\n"What is it? A bomb?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir. It makes holes. It makes holes real quick."\r\n\r\nBlair scowled at the box. "What the hell do I want of holes?"\r\n\r\nBill Stephens came forward with further explanation. "You see, sir, Ted\r\nand I are inventors. We make, well--things. We\'ve been working on this\r\ninvention in our basement and it seems to be a success."\r\n\r\n"We don\'t quite know why it\'s a success," Ted said, "but it is."\r\n\r\n"We\'d like to demonstrate it for you."\r\n\r\n"Well, go ahead and demonstrate."\r\n\r\nTed raised the box and aimed it horizontally at nothing in particular.\r\nHe pressed a black button. There was an odd whirring noise. He took his\r\nhand off the button and lowered the box.\r\n\r\n"What are you waiting for?" Blair growled.\r\n\r\n"Nothing. That\'s it. 

I\'ve made the hole."\r\n\r\n"Are you two crazy? What kind of a fool trick--?"\r\n\r\nTed reached down and took a pencil off the desk. "May I borrow this?"\r\nWithout waiting for permission, he put the pencil carefully into the\r\nplace he\'d pointed the box. Half the pencil disappeared. He took his\r\nhand away. The part of the pencil still in sight didn\'t come with it. It\r\nstayed where it was, lying in thin air, horizontally, with no apparent\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nH. Joshua Blair goggled and turned three shades whiter. "Wha-wha-what\r\nthe hell!"\r\n\r\n"And now, if you\'ll try to move the pencil, the demonstration will be\r\ncomplete."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLike a man in a trance, Blair got up from his desk and grasped the\r\npencil. It wouldn\'t move. 

He got red in the face and threw all his\r\nweight on it. It would neither pull nor push. It stayed where it was.\r\nFinally Blair backed away from the thing. He leaned on his desk and\r\npanted.\r\n\r\n"You see," Ted said, "The hole goes into the fourth dimension. There\'s\r\nno other explanation. And the fourth dimension holds solider than\r\nconcrete."\r\n\r\nOld Blair\'s head was spinning, but business instinct came quickly to his\r\nrescue. "What happens," he asked, "if something in the third dimension\r\nis in the way?"\r\n\r\n"It gets out of the way," Bill said.\r\n\r\nTed demonstrated. He trained the box on the visible remains of the\r\npencil. It vanished.\r\n\r\nBlair said, "Well, I\'ll be damned!"\r\n\r\n"We figure this will save you a lot of money in construction work," Bill\r\nsaid. "You can get along without riveters. You just have a man put holes\r\nin girders with this and push the rivets through. You also make holes\r\nfor the beam-ends, and your entire building will be anchored in the\r\nfourth dimension."\r\n\r\n"Do it again," Blair said.\r\n\r\nTed made another hole and put another pencil into it. Blair grasped the\r\npencil and applied leverage. The pencil snapped at the point it entered\r\nthe next dimension but the broken end of the far piece was not to be\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nBlair asked, "You say you two invented this gadget?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s right," Bill said. "We\'ve got a workshop in my basement. We\r\ninvent in the evenings after we come home from work."\r\n\r\n"What do you work at?"\r\n\r\n"I read gas meters. He\'s a clerk in a supermarket."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you want money for this thing."\r\n\r\n"We\'d like to sell it, yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"How much do you want for it?"\r\n\r\n"Well, we don\'t know. What\'s it worth to you?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing probably. Leave it here a few days. I\'ll look it over and let\r\nyou know."\r\n\r\n"But--"\r\n\r\n"And don\'t call me--I\'ll call you.

"\r\n\r\n"But--"\r\n\r\n"Leave your address and phone number with my secretary."\r\n\r\nAfter Ted and Bill left, Blair yelled, "Get me Jake Steadman in the\r\nengineering department!" He didn\'t bother using the intercom, but his\r\nsecretary heard him anyhow.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTed and Bill went to work on an idea they had for the treatment of\r\nleather. You dipped your shoes in a solution and they lasted forever.\r\nThe thing didn\'t work too well, however. It was full of bugs. They tried\r\nto eliminate the bugs and once in a while they thought of H. Joshua\r\nBlair.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think it\'s about time he called us?" Ted asked.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be so impatient. He\'s a big man. He owns a big company. It takes\r\ntime."\r\n\r\n"He\'s had over a month."\r\n\r\n"Relax. We\'ll hear from him."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother week passed, and another, until one evening Ted came galloping\r\ninto the workshop with news. "That big new addition to the City Hall!\r\nThey\'re working on it! H. Joshua Blair Construction Company. A big sign\r\nsays so!"\r\n\r\n"Relax. You\'ll blow a tube.

"\r\n\r\n"Relax hell! He\'s using our invention to put up the steel girders. Just\r\nlike we suggested to him. Guys with boxes like ours making holes and\r\nputting in rivets!"\r\n\r\nBill stopped what he was doing. 

"He said he\'d call us. Maybe he forgot.\r\nMaybe we better go see him."\r\n\r\nThey both knocked off work the next day and got to Blair\'s office at\r\nnine o\'clock. The red-headed secretary said, "You\'ll have to make an\r\nappointment."\r\n\r\n"Appointment hell!" Ted headed for the inner door. Bill followed him.\r\nThey went into H. Joshua Blair\'s office to find him in conference with\r\ntwo vice-presidents. Ted said, "Mr. Blair, we came--"\r\n\r\n"Who in the devil are you?"\r\n\r\n"You remember us. Ted Baker and Bill Stephens. We came about our\r\ninvention."\r\n\r\n"What invention?"\r\n\r\n"Our hole maker. You\'re using it on the City Hall addition."\r\n\r\nBlair glowered. "Where\'d you get the idea it was yours? Have you got any\r\npatents to show?

"\r\n\r\n"Well, no. We didn\'t--"\r\n\r\n"I did! Fourteen good solid patents. You two better go peddle your\r\ngroceries.

"\r\n\r\n"Now look, Mr. Blair."\r\n\r\nBlair raised his voice. "Throw these two bums out!"\r\n\r\nThree huskies appeared as by magic to do Blair\'s bidding. As Ted and\r\nBill landed on the sidewalk, one of the vice-presidents said, "Do you\r\nthink that was smart, H. J.? They might cause trouble.

"\r\n\r\nBlair snorted. "They haven\'t got a prayer. A meter reader and a grocery\r\nclerk!"\r\n\r\n"We could have at least given them a few hundred."\r\n\r\n"Not on your life. Never give a sucker an even break, Jim. Give them\r\nanything at all, we acknowledge their claim. That\'d be stupid."\r\n\r\n"Maybe you\'re right."\r\n\r\n"Of course I\'m right. It\'s business. Now about those other bids. By gad!\r\nWe can run every contractor in town out of competition! They can\'t touch\r\nour prices!"\r\n\r\nOut on the sidewalk, Bill and Ted sat mournfully looking up at the vast\r\nsteel skeleton, held together literally by their own genius. Ted said,\r\n"We got a raw deal."\r\n\r\n"Maybe we had it coming. We were pretty stupid."\r\n\r\n"Anything we can do?

"\r\n\r\n"Doesn\'t look like it."\r\n\r\n"Maybe the leather solution will turn out."\r\n\r\n"Maybe." Bill looked wistfully up at the steel skeleton. "At even a cent\r\na hole, we\'d have done all right.

"\r\n\r\n"Let\'s go home and get to work."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the Mighty and Benevolent Kingdom of Szkazia, a minor reign of terror\r\nexisted. The King, tired of complaints from his subjects, had just\r\nfinished dressing down his Prime Minister. The Prime Minister was\r\npassing the abuse on to his Chief Scientist. "If something isn\'t done\r\nsoon, I won\'t be responsible for your head, my friend. The King is in a\r\nrage."\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the Chief Scientist watered--partly from fear, and partly\r\nfrom nights and days spent in his laboratory beating out his brains on\r\none idea after another.\r\n\r\n"I\'m doing my best, sire--"\r\n\r\n"It\'s not good enough! These steel girders coming out of nowhere!\r\nBanging people in the head--whacking them in the stomach! Why it isn\'t\r\nsafe to walk through the halls of the Administration Building. Even the\r\nbedrooms of the Executive Apartments are not safe! The other night the\r\nDirector of Propaganda had just gone to bed--"\r\n\r\n"I know of the incident," the Chief Scientist said hurriedly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you do? But you\'ve done nothing about--"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been working hard," the scientist said patiently, "and I think I\r\nhave the solution. Give me another day.

"\r\n\r\n"One day, then. After that--" The Prime Minister made a significant\r\nslicing motion with his finger.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister chewed his fingernails and watched the clock. Sleep\r\nwas out of the question with the King calling up every little while\r\nyelling for action. The Minister counted the hours and presented himself\r\nat the Royal Laboratories precisely twenty-four hours later. "Time\'s\r\nup," he snapped.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Scientist was wiping his face. There were new lines around his\r\nmouth. 

He indicated a small steel box. "I think I\'ve got it," he said.\r\n"Come with me."\r\n\r\nThey went swiftly to the Administration Building. "This should be close\r\nenough. We depress this lever and--and hope."\r\n\r\n"Well, do it--do it!"\r\n\r\nThe Chief Scientist pushed the lever on the steel box. A whirring sound\r\ncame from within. All the steel girder ends in sight--all the nasty\r\nlittle rivets--disappeared. The Chief Scientist smiled and wiped his\r\nface again. "It worked," he said.\r\n\r\n"Excellent. I\'ll see that you get a medal."\r\n\r\n"Thank you," the Chief Scientist said sadly. That was the trouble with\r\npeople nowadays. They either handed you a medal or your head.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTed and Bill stared sadly at the mess around the City Hall. Bill said,\r\n"It\'s a good thing it collapsed at night so nobody was killed, isn\'t\r\nit?"\r\n\r\n"You said it. I\'d have felt guilty if there\'d been any casualties."\r\n\r\n"What do you suppose went wrong?

"\r\n\r\n"You got me. What do you think they\'ll do to old Blair?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, but it looks pretty bad. They refused to let him out on\r\nbail."\r\n\r\n"Serves him right. The way he treated us."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got it wrong. He treated us swell. He did us a big favor. We\r\ncould have been blamed for this."\r\n\r\nBill thought it over before saying, "I guess you\'re right. I hadn\'t\r\nlooked at it that way."\r\n\r\n"Let\'s go home and get to work on the leather solution."\r\n\r\nSo they did.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _If Worlds of Science Fiction_\r\n    September 1952.

Nerves. Nerves._\r\n\r\nHe turned around and got his private secretary on the viewer. She\r\nsimpered at him, trying to be friendly with her dull, sunken eyes.\r\n\r\n"Betty," he told her, "I want you to make an appointment with my\r\ntherapist for me this afternoon. Tell him it\'s just a case of nerves,\r\nthough.

"\r\n\r\n"Yes sir. 

Anything else?" Her voice, like every one\'s, was a high\r\npitched screech trying to be heard above the noise.\r\n\r\nJoseph winced. "Anybody want to see me this morning?

"\r\n\r\n"Well, Mr. Wills says he has the first model of his invention ready to\r\nshow you."\r\n\r\n"Let him in whenever he\'s ready. Otherwise, if nothing important comes\r\nup, I want you to leave me alone."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, certainly." She smiled again, a mechanical, automatic smile\r\nthat seemed to want to be something more.\r\n\r\nJoseph switched off.\r\n\r\n_That was a damn funny way of saying it_, he thought. _"I want you to\r\nleave me alone." As if somebody were after me._\r\n\r\nHe spent about an hour on routine paperwork and then Bob Wills showed\r\nup so Joseph switched off his dictograph and let him in.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid you\'ll have to make it brief, Bob," he grinned. "I\'ve a\r\nwhale of a lot of work to do, and I seem to be developing a splitting\r\nheadache. Nerves, you know."\r\n\r\n"Sure, Mister Partch. I won\'t take a minute; I just thought you\'d like\r\nto have a look at the first model of our widget and get clued in on our\r\nprogress so far...."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, just go ahead. 

How does the thing work?"\r\n\r\nBob smiled and set the grey steel chassis on Partch\'s desk, sat down in\r\nfront of it, and began tracing the wiring for Joseph.\r\n\r\nIt was an interesting problem, or at any rate should have been. It\r\nwas one that had been harassing cities, industry, and particularly\r\nair-fields, for many years. Of course, every one wore earplugs--and\r\nthat helped a little. And some firms had partially solved the problem\r\nby using personnel that were totally deaf, because such persons\r\nwere the only ones who could stand the terrific noise levels that a\r\ntechnological civilization forced everyone to endure. The noise from\r\na commercial rocket motor on the ground had been known to drive men\r\nmad, and sometimes kill them. There had never seemed to be any wholly\r\nsatisfactory solution.\r\n\r\nBut now Bob Wills apparently had the beginnings of a real answer. A\r\ndevice that would use the principle of interference to cancel out sound\r\nwaves, leaving behind only heat.\r\n\r\nIt should have been fascinating to Partch, but somehow he couldn\'t make\r\nhimself get interested in it.\r\n\r\n"The really big problem is the power requirement," Wills was saying.\r\n"We\'ve got to use a lot of energy to cancel out big sound waves, but\r\nwe\'ve got several possible answers in mind and we\'re working on all of\r\nthem."\r\n\r\nHe caressed the crackle-finish box fondly.\r\n\r\n"The basic gimmick works fine, though. Yesterday I took it down to a\r\nstatic test stand over in building 90 and had them turn on a pretty\r\nfair-sized steering rocket for one of the big moon-ships. Reduced the\r\nnoise-level by about 25 per cent, it did. 

Of course, I still needed my\r\nplugs."\r\n\r\nJoseph nodded approvingly and stared vacantly into the maze of\r\ntransistors and tubes.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve built it to work on ordinary 60 cycle house current," Wills told\r\nhim. "In case you should want to demonstrate it to anybody."\r\n\r\nPartch became brusque. He liked Bob, but he had work to do.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I probably shall, Bob. I tell you what, why don\'t you just leave\r\nit here in my office and I\'ll look it over later, hm?"\r\n\r\n"Okay, Mr. 

Partch."\r\n\r\nJoseph ushered him out of the office, complimenting him profusely on\r\nthe good work he was doing. Only after he was gone and Joseph was alone\r\nagain behind the closed door, did he realize that he had a sudden\r\nyearning for company, for someone to talk to.\r\n\r\n<tb>\r\n\r\nPartch had Betty send him in a light lunch and he sat behind his desk\r\nnibbling the tasteless stuff without much enthusiasm. He wondered if he\r\nwas getting an ulcer.\r\n\r\nYes, he decided, he was going to have to have a long talk with Dr.\r\nColes that afternoon. Be a pleasure to get it all off his chest, his\r\nfeeling of melancholia, his latent sense of doom. Be good just to talk\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\nOh, everything was getting to him these days. He was in a rut, that was\r\nit. A rut.\r\n\r\nHe spat a sesame seed against the far wall and the low whir of the\r\nautomatic vacuum cleaner rose and fell briefly.\r\n\r\nJoseph winced. The speakers were playing "Slam Bang Boom" again.\r\n\r\nHis mind turned away from the grating melody in self defense, to look\r\ninward on himself.\r\n\r\nOf what, after all, did Joseph Partch\'s life consist? He licked his\r\nfingers and thought about it.\r\n\r\nWhat would he do this evening after work, for instance?\r\n\r\nWhy, he\'d stuff his earplugs back in his inflamed ears and board the\r\ncommuter\'s copter and ride for half an hour listening to the drumming\r\nof the rotors and the pleading of the various canned commercials played\r\non the copter\'s speakers loud enough to be heard over the engine noise\r\nand through the plugs.\r\n\r\nAnd then when he got home, there would be the continuous yammer of his\r\nwife added to the Tri-Di set going full blast and the dull food from\r\nthe automatic kitchen. And synthetic coffee and one stale cigaret.\r\nPerhaps a glass of brandy to steady his nerves if Dr. Coles approved.\r\n\r\nPartch brooded. The sense of foreboding had been submerged in the day\'s\r\nwork, but it was still there. It was as if, any moment, a hydrogen\r\nbomb were going to be dropped down the chimney, and you had no way of\r\nknowing when.\r\n\r\nAnd what would there be to do after he had finished dinner that night?\r\nWhy, the same things he had been doing every night for the past fifteen\r\nyears. There would be Tri-Di first of all. The loud comedians, and the\r\nmusical commercials, and the loud bands, and the commercials, and the\r\nloud songs....\r\n\r\nAnd every twenty minutes or so, the viewer would jangle with one of\r\nFelicia\'s friends calling up, and more yammering from Felicia.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there would be company that night, to play cards and sip drinks\r\nand talk and talk and talk, and never say a thing at all.\r\n\r\nThere would be aircraft shaking the house now and then, and the cry of\r\nthe monorail horn at intervals.\r\n\r\nAnd then, at last, it would be time to go to bed, and the murmur of the\r\nsomnolearner orating him on the Theory of Groups all through the long\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nAnd in the morning, he would be shocked into awareness with the clangor\r\nof the alarm clock and whatever disc jockey the clock radio happened to\r\ntune in on.\r\n\r\nJoseph Partch\'s world was made up of sounds and noises, he decided.\r\nDimly, he wondered of what civilization itself would be constructed if\r\nall the sounds were once taken away. _Why_, after all, was the world\r\nof Man so noisy? It was almost as if--as if everybody were making as\r\nmuch noise as they could to conceal the fact that there was something\r\nlacking. Or something they were afraid of.\r\n\r\nLike a little boy whistling loudly as he walks by a cemetery at night.\r\n\r\nPartch got out of his chair and stared out the window again. There was\r\na fire over on the East Side, a bad one by the smoke. The fire engines\r\nwent screaming through the streets like wounded dragons. Sirens, bells.\r\nPolice whistles.\r\n\r\nAll at once, Partch realized that never in his life had he experienced\r\nreal quiet or solitude. That actually, he had no conception of what an\r\nabsence of thunder and wailing would be like. A total absence of sound\r\nand noise.\r\n\r\nAlmost, it was like trying to imagine what a negation of _space_ would\r\nbe like.\r\n\r\nAnd then he turned, and his eyes fell on Bob Wills\' machine. It could\r\nreduce the noise level of a rocket motor by 25 per cent, Wills had\r\nsaid. Here in the office, the sound level was less than that of a\r\nrocket motor.\r\n\r\nAnd the machine worked on ordinary house current, Bob had said.\r\n\r\nPartch had an almost horrifying idea. Suppose....\r\n\r\nBut what would Dr. 

Coles say about this, Partch wondered. Oh, he had to\r\nget a grip on himself. This was silly, childish....\r\n\r\nBut looking down, he found that he had already plugged in the line\r\ncord. An almost erotic excitement began to shake Joseph\'s body. The\r\nsense of disaster had surged up anew, but he didn\'t recognize it yet.\r\n\r\nAn absence of _sound_? No! Silly!\r\n\r\nThen a fire engine came tearing around the corner just below the\r\nwindow, filling the office with an ocean of noise.\r\n\r\nJoseph\'s hand jerked and flicked the switch.\r\n\r\nAnd then the dream came back to him, the nightmare of the night before\r\nthat had precipitated, unknown to him, his mood of foreboding. It came\r\nback to him with stark realism and flooded him with unadorned fear.\r\n\r\nIn the dream, he had been in a forest. Not just the city park, but a\r\n_real_ forest, one thousands of miles and centuries away from human\r\ncivilization. A wood in which the foot of Man had never trod.\r\n\r\nIt was dark there, and the trees were thick and tall. 

There was no\r\nwind, the leaves were soft underfoot. And Joseph Partch was all alone,\r\n_completely_ alone.\r\n\r\nAnd it was--quiet.\r\n\r\nDoctor Coles looked at the patient on the white cot sadly.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve only seen a case like it once before in my entire career, Dr.\r\nLeeds."\r\n\r\nLeeds nodded.\r\n\r\n"It _is_ rather rare. 

Look at him--total catatonia. He\'s curled into a\r\nperfect foetal position. Never be the same again, I\'m afraid."\r\n\r\n"The shock must have been tremendous. An awful psychic blow, especially\r\nto a person as emotionally disturbed as Mr. Partch was."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that machine of Mr. Wills\' is extremely dangerous. What amazes\r\nme is that it didn\'t kill Partch altogether. Good thing we got to him\r\nwhen we did."\r\n\r\nDr. Coles rubbed his jaw.\r\n\r\n"Yes, you know it _is_ incredible how much the human mind can sometimes\r\ntake, actually. As you say, it\'s a wonder it didn\'t kill him."\r\n\r\nHe shook his head.\r\n\r\n"Perfectly horrible. How could any modern human stand it? Two hours, he\r\nwas alone with that machine. Imagine--_two hours_ of total silence!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s The Rumble and the Roar, by Stephen Bartholomew\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a perfectly conventional tour, once around the Milky Way with\r\nstops at several of the major stars. It was supposed to take about\r\neighty-eight million years so they planned to be back for supper.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning the students had remained in a fairly close knot\r\naround mundo Karftahiti, their instructor, but as the tour progressed\r\nsome of the more venturesome strayed further and further from the rest\r\nof the class.\r\n\r\nDro Orena and Dro Xeluchli had wandered a greater distance than usual\r\nfrom the crowd and were jamming experimental thought webs into a large\r\nspace vortex when Xeluchli signalled to Orena to tune her mind off the\r\nlecture frequency. It was against the rules, of course, but then Orena\r\nsupposed Xeluchli would take the blame for her if they were caught, so\r\nshe switched over to the conversational band.\r\n\r\n"Want to have some fun?" asked Xeluchli.\r\n\r\nOrena continued to stare into the space vortex. "How?" she asked.\r\n\r\nXeluchli waved a visible thought fragment in a circle about him. "The\r\nstars," he said. 

"Let\'s explore a little on our own. 

They never hit the\r\nreally good spots on these tours."\r\n\r\nOrena had been thinking for a long time of doing that very thing so she\r\nhardly argued at all before letting Xeluchli convince her.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll be gone only a little while and they\'ll never miss us," said\r\nXeluchli as they headed for a nearby star-cluster.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEverything would have been all right if they had obeyed the rules.\r\n"Hands off the planets," the rules said, and that was really a\r\nreasonable and intelligent demand. In all fairness to them, it must be\r\nadmitted that Orena and Xeluchli had no intention of breaking that rule\r\nwhen they strayed away from the rest of the crowd.\r\n\r\nThey found this little planet which was listed in the textbook as\r\n"BuP"; an .02F star with nine planets. By a lucky chance they were just\r\nin time to see a transient little civilization spring into being on its\r\nthird planet. This was too wonderful a chance to miss so they decided\r\nto stay a few hundred thousand years and see how it would end. They\r\nwould catch up with the rest of the tour afterward.\r\n\r\nThe creatures entering into civilization were bipeds and of a physical\r\nappearance rather low on the aesthetic scale but Orena and Xeluchli\r\nsoon discovered that they were bi-sexual. This pleased them very much\r\nand made them feel that they had something in common with this little\r\ncivilization, for Orena and Xeluchli were bi-sexuals too, and bi-sexual\r\ncivilizations were rare. Orena and Xeluchli had, in fact, been the\r\nonly bi-sexuals in the touring group, which had been composed mostly\r\nof the slow-moving amoeboids from Procyon and the emotionally unstable\r\npenta-sexuals from Antares.\r\n\r\nIt was a land civilization which they had found and, just as the\r\ntextbooks said, it was having its beginning in the river deltas of\r\nthe continents. The bipeds were both herbivorous and carnivorous and\r\nthe duration and bloodiness of their early wars was almost exactly as\r\npredicted by Globnung\'s food-war formula. The speed of advance of the\r\ncivilization was a little slow, but still comfortably within the lower\r\nlimits of the Atati equation.\r\n\r\nEverything went well for the first five thousand years, but then Orena\r\nand Xeluchli began to catch signs of Gibrait\'s anachronism. 

They\r\nwatched anxiously for a while, and soon they saw that their fears\r\nhad been justified. Sociological advance had fallen so far behind\r\ntechnological advance that the Law of Socio-Martial Flux had been\r\nbrought into play. The little civilization would almost certainly die a\r\npremature death.\r\n\r\nOrena and Xeluchli watched the invention of greater and greater weapons\r\nand the hopeless retardation of the social system and were saddened.\r\nThey had hoped to watch a real civilization and this one was not even\r\ngoing to go past the one-planet stage. They did not see how it could\r\nlast half a century more.\r\n\r\n"And they\'re bi-sexuals, too," said Xeluchli. "It\'s a shame. 

I wish we\r\ncould do something."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but you know what the rules are," reminded Orena. "We can only\r\nwatch. We can\'t help them."\r\n\r\n"I know," said Xeluchli a little crossly. "A bunch of poly-sexuals and\r\nsixth-degree intellectuals make rules and we\'re supposed to obey them.\r\nYou know, I\'m tempted to interfere. No one would know."\r\n\r\nOrena objected, but she was really in favor of violating the rule, too,\r\nand after a while she let Xeluchli have his way.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll start the civilization over," he suggested. "It was low in some\r\nqualities at the very start, but if we begin it over again with two\r\nabove-average specimens I\'m sure it will turn out better this time."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll save one of each sex and destroy the rest of the race," agreed\r\nOrena. "It will be just like one of the controlled experiments in the\r\nlaboratories of Arcturus 7, but on an even larger scale. Oh, this will\r\nbe interesting!"\r\n\r\n"We\'ll go down to the planet ourselves," said Xeluchli, "and pick the\r\ntwo creatures we\'ll use. We\'ll guide them and their descendants for a\r\nwhile until we\'re sure they\'ll turn out all right."\r\n\r\nThey had been heading down toward the planet and now they landed on a\r\nmountaintop. "Shall we stay together?" asked Orena.\r\n\r\n"No, let\'s each of us observe the creatures separately at close range\r\nfor a while. Then, after we\'ve seen enough to make a good choice, we\'ll\r\npick two of them and destroy the rest."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll each pick one," suggested Orena. "You pick the female and I\'ll\r\npick the male."\r\n\r\nXeluchli agreed, and added, "When you\'ve found him, enclose him in a\r\nbubble of mental protection and turn your mind to wavelength OEC. I\'ll\r\nturn my mind to wavelength HHW when I have a female protected and the\r\ncombination of these waves, each harmless by itself, will result in\r\na .0008w wave which will destroy the rest of the race. Afterward we\'ll\r\nmeet on this hill."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was a city at the foot of the mountains and Orena headed there.\r\nShe intermingled her atoms with those of a building for a while and\r\nwatched from one of its inner walls, trying to get some idea of the\r\nhabits of the bipeds.\r\n\r\nAt first she was puzzled by the fact that only one sex of the creatures\r\nentered the room she was watching. After a while, though, she began to\r\nsuspect its true nature. She was learning little here, so she went out\r\ninto the streets of the city where she could observe all phases of life.\r\n\r\nAt first she assumed a shape that the bipeds could not see, but after\r\na while she decided that she could best accomplish her purpose in the\r\nguise of one of the bipeds themselves. She turned herself into a female\r\nof the species and began in earnest her search for a desirable male.\r\n\r\nShe found that the society was very primitive in most respects and\r\nthat it was not at all difficult to integrate herself into it. This\r\nwas a new experience for her and one of the most thrilling things that\r\nhad ever happened to her. One by one she dropped the use of senses\r\nand mental ranges not possessed by the bipeds to make the game more\r\nexciting. Soon her senses and thoughts were operating on a level hardly\r\nabove that of the creatures themselves.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShe often found herself wishing that she had paid more attention to\r\nher classes in the lower civilizations so she could better understand\r\nthe things she was seeing. She was in no hurry to bring this adventure\r\nto an end, so for several weeks she investigated male after male,\r\nlooking for one with a high socio-kinetic rating and a low or average\r\ntechno-kinetic rating.\r\n\r\nIt was about thirty days later that she made her decision. She had been\r\ntalking to a young male biped in a bookstore when she realized that he\r\nwould do at least as well as any she had come across so far. She found\r\nthat his name was Adam Henessey and she proceeded to sound him out a\r\nlittle further.\r\n\r\n"And literature, then," she asked, picking up a book from one of the\r\ntables, "wouldn\'t you say that great literature should be placed above\r\nscience?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," Adam agreed, "the _material_ is emphasized too strongly at\r\npresent. 

We must pay more attention to the _spiritual_." He adjusted\r\nhis eyelenses. 

"I believe that that is one of the major troubles of\r\ncivilization." He tapped the ashes from his cigarette and looked at her\r\nfor confirmation.\r\n\r\n"Hell, yes!" she agreed heartily. "We are concentrating on the means\r\nand forgetting the ends."\r\n\r\n"We are concentrating on the transient," he echoed, "and forgetting the\r\neternal.

"\r\n\r\nThis bit of conversation was enough to convince the somewhat satiated\r\nOrena. She cast a web of mental protection over the biped and set her\r\nmind to an OEI wavelength.\r\n\r\nObviously Xeluchli had already made his choice and set his mind to the\r\nHHW wavelength, for all the bipeds she could see except the protected\r\nAdam Henessey immediately fell to the ground and lay still. The effect\r\nwas odd and uncheerful.\r\n\r\nNow came one of the most interesting games she had played in her stay\r\non the planet. She tried to match the biped\'s state of bewilderment and\r\nterror with one of her own and at the same time lead him to the top of\r\nthe mountain. She could, of course, have transported him, protective\r\nweb and all, to the mountaintop in a split second, but that would have\r\nseemed like cheating at the game. The web protecting Adam Henessey was\r\ninvisible to his eyes and Orena continued to play the part of a fellow\r\nbiped.\r\n\r\nIn his confused state, it was not difficult to lead Adam up the\r\nmountain by little suggestions or, often by merely taking the first\r\nstep. She suggested that from the mountaintop they could see better\r\nwhat had happened and whether anyone else was alive. 

He even added\r\nthe idea that they might get out of the area of contamination or\r\nwhatever it was by climbing. "Heavy gases stay low," he said, assuming,\r\napparently, that another war had been declared.\r\n\r\nThey were the first to reach the top, Xeluchli and his find were not\r\nyet in sight. Orena kept up her act while they waited. She and Adam\r\nHenessey searched out over the valleys below and chattered worried\r\nideas at each other.\r\n\r\nOrena was secretly watching for Xeluchli whenever she looked down the\r\nmountain but soon the sun set and the light faded. It was very dark\r\nin the valleys and she did not wish to use any but biped eyes in the\r\npresence of Adam Henessey, at least not until Xeluchli arrived, so she\r\ngave up looking.\r\n\r\nAs time went by she began to get worried. It was cold on the mountain\r\nand she grew impatient to change to some other form. She searched the\r\nvalleys below again, but not even a light of the dead city was visible.\r\n\r\nThe biped was growing nervous and she was not sure how much longer she\r\ncould keep him here. He was standing sheltered by a crag of rock and\r\ngazing out into the dark spaces where the city had been, and for a long\r\nwhile Orena stood near him and looked far out into the valleys to the\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nTime passed and finally the sun began to rise and she grew more worried\r\nthan ever. A terrible thought hit her and she shivered. She stole\r\nglances at Adam Henessey from time to time and she noticed that he was\r\nglancing queerly at _her_ now and then. This continued for some time.\r\n\r\nFinally she could stand it no longer.\r\n\r\nShe turned to him and asked:\r\n\r\n"Heavens, is that you, Xeluchli?"\r\n\r\nShe really did not need an answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   If this story holds true in real\r\n                   practice, it may reveal something\r\n                   about us that we\'ve never known.\r\n\r\n\r\n"We\'re just starting on the first one--Walraven, ship\'s communications\r\nman," Costain said, low-voiced. "Captain Maxon and Vaughn have called\r\nin. 

There\'s been no word from Ragan."\r\n\r\nCoordinator Erwin took his seat beside the psychologist, his bearing\r\nas militarily authoritative in spite of civilian clothing as the room\'s\r\nair was medical.\r\n\r\n"Maybe Ragan won\'t turn up," Erwin said. "Maybe we\'ve still got a man\r\nout there to bring the ship back."\r\n\r\nCostain made a quieting gesture, his eyes on the three-man psych\r\nteam grouped about Walraven\'s wheeled reclining chair. "They\'ve given\r\nWalraven a light somnolent. Not enough to put him out, just enough to\r\nmake him relive the flight in detail. Accurately."\r\n\r\nThe lead psych man killed the room\'s lighting to a glow. "Lieutenant\r\nWalraven, the ship is ready. You are at your post, with Captain Maxon\r\nand Lieutenants Vaughn and Ragan. The first Mars flight is about to\r\nblast off. How do you feel?"\r\n\r\nWalraven lay utterly relaxed, his face dreaming. His voice had the\r\nwaning sound of a tape running down for lack of power.\r\n\r\n"Jumpy," he said. "But not really afraid. We\'re too well conditioned\r\nfor that, I guess. This is a big thing, an important thing. 

Exciting."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt had been exciting at first. The long preparation over, training and\r\nstudy and news interviews and final parties all dreamlike and part of\r\nthe past. Outside now, invisible but hearteningly present beyond the\r\nship\'s impermeable hull, the essential and privileged people waiting to\r\nsee them off. The ship\'s power plant was humming gently like a giant,\r\npatient cat.\r\n\r\nCaptain Maxon passed out muscle-relaxant capsules. The total boneless\r\nrelaxation that was their defense against acceleration came quickly.\r\n\r\nThe ship was two hours out, beyond lunar orbit and still accelerating,\r\nwhen, trained for months against the moment, set each about his task.\r\nReadings occupied Maxon and Vaughn and Ragan while Walraven checked his\r\ncommunications and telemetering gear.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the transmitter slot had licked up its first coded\r\ntape--no plain text here, security before even safety--and reported all\r\nwell, the predicted borne out, that they became aware of the Feeling.\r\n\r\nThe four of them sat in their unsqueaking gimbaled seats and looked\r\nat each other, sharing the Feeling and knowing that they shared it,\r\nbut not why. Vaughn, who was given to poetry and some degree of\r\nsoul-searching, made the first open recognition.\r\n\r\n"There\'s something wrong," he said.\r\n\r\nThe others agreed and, agreeing, could add nothing of explanation to\r\nthe wrongness. Time passed while they sat, seeing within themselves for\r\nthe answer--and if not for answer, at least for identification--but\r\nnothing came and nothing changed except that with time the steady\r\npressure of the Feeling grew stronger.\r\n\r\nVaughn, again, was first to react to the pressure. "We\'ve got to\r\ndo something." He twisted out of his seat and wavered in the small\r\npseudogravity of the ship\'s continuing acceleration. "I\'ve never in my\r\nlife felt so desolate, so--"\r\n\r\nHe stopped. "There aren\'t any words," he said helplessly.\r\n\r\nLess articulate than Vaughn and knowing it, the others did not try to\r\nhelp find the words. Only Ragan, professional soldier without family or\r\nclose tie anywhere in the world, had a suggestion.\r\n\r\n"The ship\'s power plant is partly psionic," Ragan said. "I don\'t\r\nunderstand the principle, but it\'s been drilled into us that no\r\nother system can give a one-directional thrust without reaction. The\r\npsi-drive is tied into our minds in the same way it\'s tied into the\r\natomic and electronic components. It\'s part of us and we\'re part of it."\r\n\r\nEven Maxon, crew authority on the combination drive, missed his meaning\r\nat first.\r\n\r\n"If our atomic shielding fails," Ragan explained, "we\'re irradiated.\r\nIf our psionics bank fails, we may feel anything. Maybe the trouble is\r\nthere."\r\n\r\nPrivately they disagreed, certain that nothing so disquieting as the\r\nFeeling that weighted them down could be induced even by so cryptic a\r\nmarriage of dissimilar principles as made up the ship\'s power plant.\r\nStill it was a possible avenue of relief.\r\n\r\n"It\'s worth trying," Maxon said, and they checked.\r\n\r\nAnd checked, and checked.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"We worked for hours," Walraven said, "but nothing came of it. None\r\nof us, even Maxon, knew enough about the psi-drive to be sure, but we\r\nended up certain that the trouble wasn\'t there. It was in us."\r\n\r\nThe drug was wearing thin, leaving him pale and shaken. His face had a\r\nglisten of sweat under the lowered lights.\r\n\r\nThe lead psych man chose a hypodermic needle, looked to Erwin and\r\nCostain for authority, and administered a second injection.\r\n\r\n"You gave up searching," he said. "What then, Lieutenant?"\r\n\r\n"We waited," Walraven said.\r\n\r\nHe relaxed, his face smoothing to impersonal detachment as his mind\r\nslipped back to the ship and its crew. Watching, Costain felt a sudden\r\ndeep unease as if the man\'s mind had really winged back through time\r\nand space and carried a part of his own with it.\r\n\r\n"There was only one more possible check," Walraven said. "We had to\r\nwait two days for that."\r\n\r\nThe check was Maxon\'s idea, simple of execution and unarguable of\r\nresult. At halfway point acceleration must cease, the ship rotate on\r\nits gyros and deceleration set in. There would be a period of waiting\r\nwhen the power plant must be shut off completely.\r\n\r\nIf the Feeling stemmed from the psi-drive, it would lift then.\r\n\r\nIt did not lift. They sat weightless and disoriented while the gyros\r\nprecessed and the ship swung end by end and the steady pressure of the\r\nFeeling mounted up and up without relief.\r\n\r\n"It gets worse every hour," Vaughn said raggedly.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not a matter of time," Maxon said. "It\'s the distance. The\r\nFeeling grows stronger as we get farther from home."\r\n\r\nThey sat for another time without talk, feeling the distance build up\r\nbehind them and sensing through the unwindowed hull of the ship what\r\nthe emptiness outside must be like. The ship was no longer an armored\r\nprojectile bearing them snugly and swiftly to a first planetfall. It\r\nwas a walnut shell without strength or direction.\r\n\r\nIn the end they talked out their problem because there was nothing else\r\nthey could do.\r\n\r\n"We\'re men," Maxon said, not as if he must convince himself but as if\r\nit were a premise that had to be made, a starting point for all logic.\r\n"We\'re reasoning creatures. If the trouble lies in ourselves we can\r\nfind its source and its reason for being."\r\n\r\nHe picked Vaughn first because Vaughn had been first to sense the\r\nwrongness and because the most sensitive link in a chain is also\r\npredictably its weakest.\r\n\r\n"Try," Maxon said. "I know there are no words to describe this thing,\r\nbut get as close as you can.

"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVaughn tried. "It isn\'t home-sickness. It\'s a different thing\r\naltogether from nostalgia. It\'s not just fear. I\'m afraid--not of any\r\n_thing_, just afraid in the way a child is afraid of falling in his\r\ndreams, when he\'s really had no experience with falling because he\'s\r\nnever fallen more than a few inches in his life.... When I think of my\r\nwife, it\'s not the same at all as if I were just in some far corner of\r\nthe Earth with only land and water between us. Even if I were marooned\r\non an uncharted island somewhere with no hope of seeing home again, I\r\nwouldn\'t feel this way. 

There wouldn\'t be this awful _pulling_."\r\n\r\nRagan agreed with Vaughn that the Feeling was essentially a _pull_, but\r\nbeyond agreement could add nothing. Ragan had covered the world without\r\nforming a tie to hold him; one place was as good as another and he\r\nfelt no loss for any particular spot on Earth.\r\n\r\n"I only want to be back there," he said simply. "Anywhere but here."\r\n\r\n"I was born on a farm in New England," Walraven said. "Out of the land,\r\nlike my father and his people before him. I\'m part of that land, no\r\nmatter how far from it I go, because everything I am came from it. I\r\nfeel uprooted. 

I don\'t belong here."\r\n\r\n_Uprooted_ was the key for which they had hunted.\r\n\r\nMaxon said slowly, "There are wild animals on Earth that can\'t live\r\naway from their natural homes. Insects--how does a termite feel, cut\r\noff from its hive? Maybe that\'s our trouble. 

Something bigger than\r\nindividual men made the human race what it is. Maybe we\'ve been a sort\r\nof composite being all along, without knowing it, tied together by the\r\nneed of each other and not able to exist apart. Maybe no one knew it\r\nbefore because no one was ever isolated in the way we are."\r\n\r\nWalraven had more to say, almost defiant in his earnestness. "This is\r\ngoing to sound wild, but I\'ve been fighting inside myself ever since\r\nVaughn mentioned being pulled toward home. I have the feeling that if\r\nI\'d only let go, I\'d be back where I belong." He snapped his fingers,\r\nthe sound loud in the room. 

"Like that."\r\n\r\nNo one laughed because each found in himself the same conviction\r\nwaiting to be recognized. Ragan said, "Walraven\'s right. There\'s no\r\nplace on Earth I care for more than another, but I feel I could be back\r\nthere in any one of them"--he snapped his fingers, as Walraven had\r\ndone--"as quickly as that."\r\n\r\n"I know," Maxon said. 

"But we can\'t let go. We were sent out to put\r\nthis ship into orbit around Mars. We\'ve got to take her there."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWalraven said, "It wasn\'t easy. The Feeling got worse as we went out\r\nand out. Knowing what it was helped a little, but not enough. We held\r\nonto each other, the four of us, to keep the group together. We _knew_\r\nwhat would happen if we let go."\r\n\r\nThe head psych man looked to Costain and put his needle away when\r\nCostain shook his head.\r\n\r\n"The ship," Coordinator Erwin said sharply. "Walraven, you did put her\r\ninto orbit?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," Walraven said. "We put her into orbit and turned on the\r\ntelemetering equipment--they\'ll be picking up her signals by now--and\r\nthen we turned our backs on each other and we let go. There wasn\'t any\r\nfeeling of motion or speed, but I felt a fresh breeze on my face and\r\nwhen I opened my eyes I was standing beside a familiar stone fence on\r\na hill above the house where I was born. You haven\'t told me, but the\r\nothers came back, too, didn\'t they?

"\r\n\r\n"All but Ragan," Erwin said. His tone made Costain think wryly, _Even\r\nthe military can snatch at straws_. "Maxon and Vaughn called in. But we\r\nhaven\'t heard from Ragan."\r\n\r\n"He wasn\'t left behind," Walraven said with certainty. "Ragan has no\r\nfamily, but he has a home. We\'re standing on it."\r\n\r\nAn orderly came in with an envelope for Costain, who opened it and\r\nhanded the paper to Erwin. To Walraven, Costain said, "It\'s a cablegram\r\nfrom North Ireland. Ragan is back."\r\n\r\nErwin was still gripping the paper in his hand when he walked with\r\nCostain out of the hospital into the bright airiness of a spring day.\r\nHe glared at the warm, blue sky.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll find a way," Erwin said. "We\'ve proved that we can put men on\r\nMars. With the right conditioning, we can keep them there."\r\n\r\n"You\'re a dedicated and resolute man, Coordinator," Costain said. 

"Do\r\nyou really suppose that any amount of conditioning could fit you to do\r\nwhat those boys failed at?"\r\n\r\nThe long moment of considering that passed before Erwin answered left a\r\nfine sheen of sweat on his face.\r\n\r\n"No," Erwin said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


All the\r\nwrecks nest there while waiting hopefully for a payload or a\r\ngrubstake. 

They have all of Solis Lacus for a landing field, and if\r\nthey spill it doesn\'t matter much. The drifting red sands soon cover\r\nup the scattered shards of dural and the slow, lonely life of Yakki\r\ngoes on like before.\r\n\r\nThe Patrol was on Kane\'s trail and the blaster in his hand was still\r\nwarm when he shoved it up against Pop Ganlon\'s ribs and made his\r\nproposition.\r\n\r\nHe wanted to get off Mars--out to Callisto. To Blackwater, to Ley\'s\r\nLanding, it didn\'t matter too much. Just off Mars, and quickly. 

His\r\neyes had a metallic glitter and his hand was rock-steady. Pop knew he\r\nmeant what he said when he told him life was cheap. Someone else\'s\r\nlife, not Kane\'s.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat\'s how it happened that _The Luck_ lifted that night from Yakki,\r\noutward bound for Ley\'s Landing, with Pop and Kane aboard her alone.\r\n\r\nSitting at the battered console of _The Luck_, Pop watched his\r\npassenger. He knew Kane, of course. Or rather, he knew of him. 

A\r\nkiller. The kind that thrives and grows fat on the frontiers. The\r\nbulky frame, the cropped black hair, the predatory eyes that looked\r\nlike two blaster muzzles. They were all familiar to Pop. Kane was all\r\nsteel and meanness. The kind of carrion bird that took what others had\r\nworked for. 

Not big time, you understand. In another age he\'d have\r\nbeen a torpedo--a hireling killer. But out among the stars he was\r\nworking for himself. And doing well.\r\n\r\nPop didn\'t care. His loyalty to the Patrol had stopped quite suddenly\r\nnot long before--in a dark alley in Lower Marsport. This was only a\r\njob, he told himself now. A job for coffee and cakes, and maybe a\r\ngrubstake to work a few more lonely rocks. Life had become a habit for\r\nPop, even if living had ended.\r\n\r\n"What are you staring at, Pop?" Kane\'s voice was like the rest of him.\r\nHarsh and cold as space itself.\r\n\r\n"At you, I guess," Pop said, "I was wondering what you\'d done--and\r\nwhere--and to whom."\r\n\r\n"You\'re a nosey old man," Kane said. "Just get me to Ley\'s Landing.\r\nThat\'s what I\'m paying for, not a thing more."\r\n\r\nPop nodded slowly and turned back to the control board. They were\r\nabove the Belt by now, and a few short hours from turnover point. The\r\ncranky drives of _The Luck_ needed all his attention.\r\n\r\nPresently he said, "We\'ll be turning over soon. Want to get some\r\nrest?"\r\n\r\nKane laughed. "No thanks, old man. I\'ll stay here and watch you."\r\n\r\nPop eyed the ready blaster and nodded again. He wondered vaguely how\r\nit would feel to die under the blast of such a weapon. It couldn\'t be\r\nvery painful. He hoped it wasn\'t painful. Perhaps the boy hadn\'t\r\nsuffered. It would be nice to be sure, he thought.\r\n\r\nThere wasn\'t much for Pop to remember about the boy. He\'d never been\r\none for writing many letters. But the District Patrolman had come down\r\nto Yakki and looked Pop up--afterward. He\'d said the boy was a good\r\nofficer. A good cop. Died doing his job, and all that sort of thing.\r\nPop swallowed hard. His job. What had \'his job\' been that night in\r\nLower Marsport, he wondered. Had someone else finished it for him?\r\n\r\nHe remembered about that time hearing on the Mars Radio that a\r\nTriangle Post Office had been knocked over by a gunman. That might\r\nhave been it. The Patrol would be after anyone knocking over EMV\r\nTriangle property. The Earth-Mars-Venus Government supported the\r\nPatrol for things like that.\r\n\r\nPop guided _The Luck_ skillfully above the Belt, avoiding with\r\npracticed ease the few errant chunks of rock that hurtled up out of\r\nthe swarms. He talked to Kane because he was starved for\r\ntalk--certainly not because he was trying to play Sherlock. Pop had\r\nlong ago realized that he was no mental giant. Besides, he owed the\r\nPatrol nothing. Not a damned thing.\r\n\r\n"Made this trip often?" Pop tried to strike up a conversation with\r\nKane. His long loneliness seemed sharper, somehow, more poignant,\r\nwhen he actually had someone to talk to.\r\n\r\n"Not often. I\'m no space pig." It was said with scorn.\r\n\r\n"There\'s a lot to spacing, you know," Pop urged.\r\n\r\nKane shrugged. "I know easier ways to make a buck, old timer.

"\r\n\r\n"Like how?"\r\n\r\n"A nosey old man, like I said," Kane smiled. Somehow, the smile wasn\'t\r\nfriendly. "Okay, Pop, since you ask. Like knocking off wacky old\r\nprospectors for their dust. Or sticking up sandcar caravans out in\r\nSyrtis. Who\'s the wiser? The red dust takes care of the leftovers."\r\n\r\nPop shook his head. 

"Not for me. There\'s the Patrol to think of."\r\n\r\nKane laughed. "Punks. Bell-boys. They\'d better learn to shoot before\r\nthey leave their school-books."\r\n\r\nPop Ganlon frowned slightly. 

"You talk big, mister."\r\n\r\nKane\'s eyes took on that metallic glitter again. He leaned forward and\r\nthrew a canvas packet on the console. It spilled crisp new EMV\r\ncertificates. Large ones. "I take big, too," he said.\r\n\r\nPop stared. Not at the money. It was more than he had ever seen in one\r\npile before, but it wasn\'t that that shook him. It was the canvas\r\npacket. It was marked: _Postal Service, EMV_. Pop suddenly felt cold,\r\nas though an icy wind had touched him.\r\n\r\n"You ... you killed a Patrolman for this," he said slowly.\r\n\r\n"That\'s right, Pop," grinned Kane easily. "Burned him down in an alley\r\nin Lower Marsport. It was like taking candy from a baby...."\r\n\r\nPop Ganlon swallowed hard. "Like taking candy from a ... baby. As easy\r\nas that...."\r\n\r\n"As easy as that, old man," Kane said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPop knew he was going to die then. He knew Kane would blast him right\r\nafter turnover point, and he knew fear. He felt something else, too.\r\nSomething that was new to him. Hate. An icy hate that left him shaken\r\nand weak.\r\n\r\nSo the boy\'s job hadn\'t been finished. It was still to do.\r\n\r\nThere was no use in dreaming of killing Kane. Pop was old. Kane was\r\nyoung--and a killer. Pop was alone and without weapons--save _The\r\nLuck_....\r\n\r\nTime passed slowly. Outside, the night of deep space keened\r\nsoundlessly. The stars burned bright, alien and strange. 

It was time,\r\nthought Pop bleakly. Time to turn _The Luck_.\r\n\r\n"Turnover point," he said softly.\r\n\r\nKane motioned with his blaster. "Get at it."\r\n\r\nPop began winding the flywheel. It made a whirring sound in the\r\nconfined space of the tiny control room. Outside, the night began to\r\npivot slowly.\r\n\r\n"We have to turn end-for-end," Pop said. "That way we can decelerate\r\non the drop into Callisto. But, of course, you know all about that,\r\nMr. 

Kane."\r\n\r\n"I told you I\'m no space pig," Kane said brusquely. "I can handle a\r\nlanding and maybe a takeoff, but the rest of it I leave for the\r\nboatmen. 

Like you, Pop."\r\n\r\nPop spun the flywheel in silence, listening to the soft whir.\r\nPresently, he let the wheel slow and then stop. He straightened and\r\nlooked up at Kane. The blaster muzzle was six inches from his belly.\r\nHe swallowed against the dryness in his throat.\r\n\r\n"You ... you\'re going to kill me," Pop said. It wasn\'t a question.\r\nKane smiled, showing white teeth.\r\n\r\n"I ... I know you are," Pop said unsteadily. "But first, I want to say\r\nsomething to you."\r\n\r\n"Talk, old timer," Kane said. "But not too much."\r\n\r\n"That boy--that boy you killed in Marsport. He was my son," Pop said.\r\n\r\nKane\'s face did not change expression. "Okay. 

So what?"\r\n\r\nPop\'s lips twitched. "I just wanted to hear you say it." He looked at\r\nthe impassive face of the killer. "You made a mistake, Mr. Kane. You\r\nshouldn\'t have done that to my boy."\r\n\r\n"Is that all?"\r\n\r\nPop nodded slowly. "I guess that\'s all."\r\n\r\nKane grinned. "Afraid, old man?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m a space pig," Pop said. "Space takes care of its own."\r\n\r\n"You\'re in a bad way, old timer," Kane said, "and you haven\'t much\r\nsense. I\'m doing you a favor."\r\n\r\nPop lifted his hands in an instinctive gesture of futile protection as\r\nthe blaster erupted flame.\r\n\r\nThere was a smell in the control room like burnt meat as Kane\r\nholstered his weapon and turned the old man over with a foot. Pop was\r\na blackened mass. Kane dragged him to the valve and jettisoned the\r\nbody into space.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlone among the stars, _The Luck_ moved across the velvet night. The\r\nsteady beat of flame from her tubes was a tiny spark of man-made\r\nvengeance on the face of the deeps.\r\n\r\nFrom her turnover point, she drove outward toward the spinning Jovian\r\nmoons. For a short while she could be seen from the EMV Observatory on\r\nCallisto, but very soon she faded into the outer darkness.\r\n\r\nMuch later, the Observatory at Land\'s End on Triton watched her\r\nheading past the gibbous mass of Pluto--out into the interstellar\r\nfastnesses.\r\n\r\nThe thrumming of the jets was still at last. A wild-eyed thing that\r\nmay once have been a man stared in horror at the fading light of the\r\nyellow star far astern.\r\n\r\nIt had taken Kane time to understand what had happened to him, and now\r\nit was too late. Space had taken care of its own. 

The air in _The\r\nLuck_ was growing foul and the food was gone. Death hung in the fetid\r\natmosphere of the tiny control room.\r\n\r\nThe old man--the boy--the money. They all seemed to spin in a\r\nnarrowing circle. Kane wanted suddenly to shriek with laughter. A\r\ncircle. 

The turnover circle. The full circle that the old man had made\r\ninstead of the proper half-turn of a turnover. Three hundred sixty\r\ndegrees instead of one hundred eighty. Three hundred sixty degrees to\r\nleave the nose of _The Luck_ pointing outward toward the stars,\r\ninstead of properly toward the Sun. A full circle to pile G on G until\r\nthe Jovian moons were missed, and the Uranian moons and Triton, too.\r\n_Ad Astra per Ardua...._\r\n\r\nWith the last fragment of his failing sanity, Kane thought of how Pop\r\nGanlon and the boy must be laughing. He was still thinking that as the\r\nlong night closed in around him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n


He\r\ncontinued, however, to slump loosely against the curving, pearly plastic\r\nof the wall, and took care not to glance toward the translucent ovals he\r\nknew to be observation panels.\r\n\r\nHe was a large man, but thin and bony-faced. His dirty gray coverall\r\nbore the name "Barnsley" upon grimy white tape over the heart. Except at\r\nthe shoulders, it looked too big for him. His hair was dark brown, but\r\nthe sandy ginger of his two-week beard seemed a better match for his\r\nblue eyes.\r\n\r\nFinally, he satisfied the softly insistent gong by standing up and\r\ngazing in turn at each of the three doors spaced around the cylindrical\r\nchamber. He deliberately adopted an expression of simple-minded\r\nanticipation as he ambled over to the nearest one.\r\n\r\nThe door was round, about four feet in diameter, and set in a flattened\r\npart of the wall with its lower edge tangent with the floor. Rods about\r\ntwo inches thick projected a hand\'s breadth at four, eight, and twelve\r\no\'clock. The markings around them suggested that each could be rotated\r\nto three different positions. Barnsley squatted on his heels to study\r\nthese.\r\n\r\nNoting that all the rods were set at the position he had learned to\r\nthink of as "one," he reached out to touch the door. It felt slightly\r\nwarm, so he allowed his fingertips to slide over the upper handle. A\r\ntentative tug produced no movement of the door.\r\n\r\n"That\'s it, though," he mumbled quietly. "Well, now to do our little act\r\nwith the others!"\r\n\r\nHe moved to the second door, where all the rods were set at "two." Here\r\nhe fell to manipulating the rod handles, pausing now and then to shove\r\nhopefully against the door. Some twenty minutes later, he tried the same\r\nroutine at the third door.\r\n\r\nEventually, he returned to his starting point and rotated the rods there\r\nat random for a few minutes. Having, apparently by accident, arranged\r\nthem in a sequence of one-two-three, he contrived to lean against the\r\ndoor at the crucial instant. As it gave beneath his weight, he grabbed\r\nthe two lower handles and pushed until the door rose to a horizontal\r\nposition level with its hinged top. It settled there with a loud click.\r\n\r\n                 *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBarnsley stooped to crawl through into an arched passage of the same\r\npearly plastic. He straightened up and walked along for about twenty\r\nfeet, flashing a white-toothed grin through his beard while muttering\r\ncurses behind it. Presently, he arrived at a small, round bay, to be\r\nconfronted by three more doors.\r\n\r\n"Bet there\'s a dozen of you three-eyed clods peeping at me," he growled.\r\n"How\'d you like me to poke a boot through the panel in front of you and\r\nkick you blubber-balls in all directions? Do you have a page in your\r\ndata books for that?

"\r\n\r\nHe forced himself to _feel_ sufficiently dull-witted to waste ten\r\nminutes opening one of the doors. The walls of the succeeding passage\r\nwere greenish, and the tunnel curved gently downward to the left.\r\nBesides being somewhat warmer, the air exuded a faint blend of heated\r\nmachine oil and something like ripe fish. The next time Barnsley came to\r\na set of doors, he found also a black plastic cube about two feet high.\r\nHe squatted on his heels to examine it.\r\n\r\n_I\'d better look inside or they\'ll be disappointed_, he told himself.\r\n\r\nFrom the corner of his eye, he watched the movement of shadows behind\r\nthe translucent panels in the walls. He could picture the observers\r\nthere: blubbery bipeds with three-jointed arms and legs ending in\r\nclusters of stubby but flexible tentacles. Their broad, spine-crested\r\nheads would be thrust forward and each would have two of his three\r\nprotruding eyes directed at Barnsley\'s slightest move. They had probably\r\nbeen staring at him in relays every second since picking up his scout\r\nship in the neighboring star system.\r\n\r\nThat is, Barnsley thought, it must have been the next system whose\r\nfourth planet he had been photo-mapping for the Terran Colonial Service.\r\nHe hoped he had not been wrong about that.\r\n\r\n_Doesn\'t matter_, he consoled himself, _as long as the Service can trace\r\nme. These slobs certainly aren\'t friendly._\r\n\r\nHe reconsidered the scanty evidence of previous contact in this volume\r\nof space, light-years from Terra\'s nearest colony. Two exploratory ships\r\nhad disappeared. There had been a garbled, fragmentary message picked up\r\nby the recorders of the colony\'s satellite beacon, which some experts\r\ninterpreted as a hasty warning. As far as he knew, Barnsley was the only\r\nTerran to reach this planet alive.\r\n\r\nTo judge from his peculiar imprisonment, his captors had recovered from\r\ntheir initial dismay at encountering another intelligent race--at least\r\nto the extent of desiring a specimen for study. In Barnsley\'s opinion,\r\nthat put him more or less ahead of the game.\r\n\r\n"They\'re gonna learn a lot!" he muttered, grinning vindictively.\r\n\r\nHe finished worrying the cover off the black box. Inside was a plastic\r\nsphere of water and several varieties of food his captors probably\r\nconsidered edible. The latter ranged from a leafy stalk bearing a number\r\nof small pods to a crumbling mass resembling moldy cheese. Barnsley\r\nhesitated.\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t had the guts to try this one yet," he reminded himself,\r\npicking out what looked like a cluster of long, white roots.\r\n\r\nThe roots squirmed feebly in his grasp. Barnsley returned them to the\r\nbox instantly.\r\n\r\nHaving selected, instead, a fruit that could have been a purple\r\ncucumber, he put it with the water container into a pocket of his\r\ncoverall and closed the box.\r\n\r\n_Maybe they won\'t remember that I took the same thing once before_, he\r\nthought. _Oh, hell, of course they will! But why be too consistent?_\r\n\r\nHe opened one of the doors and walked along a bluish passage that\r\ntwisted to the left, chewing on the purple fruit as he went. It was\r\ntougher than it looked and nearly tasteless. 

At the next junction, he\r\nunscrewed the cap of the water sphere, drained it slowly, and flipped\r\nthe empty container at one of the oval panels. A dim shadow blurred out\r\nof sight, as if someone had stepped hastily backward.\r\n\r\n"Why not?" 

growled Barnsley. "It\'s time they were shaken up a little!"\r\n\r\n                 *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPretending to have seen something where the container had struck the\r\nwall, he ran over and began to feel along the edge of the panel. When\r\nhis fingertips encountered only the slightest of seams, he doubled his\r\nfists and pounded. He thought he could detect a faint scurrying on the\r\nother side of the wall.\r\n\r\nBarnsley laughed aloud. He raised one foot almost waist-high and drove\r\nthe heel of his boot through the translucent observation panel. Seizing\r\nthe splintered edges of the hole, he tugged and heaved until he had torn\r\nout enough of the thin wall to step through to the other side. He found\r\nhimself entering a room not much larger than the passage behind him.\r\n\r\nTo his left, there was a flicker of blue from a crack in the wall. The\r\ncrack widened momentarily, emitting a gabble of mushy voices. The blue\r\ncloth was twitched away by a cluster of stubby tentacles, whereupon the\r\ncrack closed to an almost imperceptible line. Barnsley fingered his\r\nbeard to hide a grin and turned the other way.\r\n\r\nHe stumbled into a number of low stools surmounted by spongy, spherical\r\ncushions. One of these he tore off for a pillow before going on. At the\r\nend of the little room, he sought for another crack, kicked the panel\r\na bit to loosen it, and succeeded in sliding back a section of wall.\r\nThe passage revealed was about the size of those he had been forced\r\nto explore during the past two weeks, but it had an unfinished,\r\nbehind-the-scenes crudeness in appearance. Barnsley pottered along\r\nfor about fifteen minutes, during which time the walls resounded with\r\ndistant running and he encountered several obviously improvised\r\nbarriers.\r\n\r\nHe kicked his way through one, squeezed through an opening that had not\r\nbeen closed quite in time, restrained a wicked impulse to cross some\r\nwiring that must have been electrical, and at last allowed himself to be\r\ndiverted into a passage leading back to his original cell. He amused\r\nhimself by trying to picture the disruption he had caused to the\r\nhoneycomb of passageways.\r\n\r\n"There!" he grinned to himself. "That should keep them from bothering me\r\nfor a few hours. 

Maybe one or two of them will get in trouble over it--I\r\nhope!"\r\n\r\nHe arranged his stolen cushion where the wall met the floor and lay\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nA thought struck him. He sat up to examine the cushion suspiciously.\r\nIt appeared to be an equivalent to foam rubber. He prodded and twisted\r\nuntil convinced that no wires or other unexpected objects were concealed\r\ninside. Not till then did he resume his relaxed position.\r\n\r\nPresently one of his hands located and pinched a tiny switch buried\r\nin the lobe of his left ear. Barnsley concentrated upon keeping his\r\nfeatures blank as a rushing sound seemed to grow in his ear. He yawned\r\ncasually, moving one hand from behind his head to cover his mouth.\r\n\r\nHaving practiced many times before a mirror, he did not think that any\r\npossible watcher would have noticed how his thumb slipped briefly inside\r\nhis mouth to give one eyetooth a slight twist.\r\n\r\nA strong humming inundated his hearing. It continued for perhaps two\r\nminutes, paused, and began again. Barnsley waited through two repetitions\r\nbefore he "yawned" again and sleepily rolled over to hide his face in his\r\nfolded arms.\r\n\r\n"Did you get it all?" he murmured.\r\n\r\n"Clear as a bell," replied a tiny voice in his left ear. "Was that your\r\nwhole day\'s recording?"\r\n\r\n"I guess so," said Barnsley. "To tell the truth, I lose track a bit\r\nafter two weeks without a watch. Who\'s this? 

Sanchez?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s right. You seem to come in on my watch pretty nearly every\r\ntwenty-four hours. Okay, I\'ll tape a slowed-down version of your blast\r\nfor the boys in the back room. You\'re doing fine."\r\n\r\n                 *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Not for much longer," Barnsley told him. "When do I get out of here?"\r\n\r\n"Any day," Sanchez reassured him. "It was some job to learn an alien\r\nlanguage with just your recordings and some of your educated guesses to\r\ngo on. We\'ve had a regular mob sweating on it night and day.

"\r\n\r\n"How is it coming?

"\r\n\r\n"It turns out they\'re nothing to worry about. The fleet is close enough\r\nnow to pick up their surface broadcasting. Believe me, your stupid act\r\nhas them thoroughly confused. They hold debates over whether you could\r\npossibly be intelligent enough to belong in a spaceship."\r\n\r\n"Meanwhile, I\'m slowly starving," said Barnsley.\r\n\r\n"Just hang on for a couple of days. Now that we know where they are,\r\nthey\'re in for a shock. 

One of these mornings, they\'re going to hear\r\nvoices from all over their skies, demanding to know what kind of savages\r\nthey are to have kidnapped you--and in their own language!"\r\n\r\nBarnsley grinned into his improvised pillow as Sanchez signed off.\r\nThings would really work out after all. He was set for an immensely\r\nlucrative position; whether as ambassador, trade consultant, or colonial\r\ngovernor depended upon how well the experts bluffed the blubber-heads.\r\nWell, it seemed only his due for the risks he had taken.\r\n\r\n"Omigosh!" he grunted, sitting up as he pictured the horde of Terran\r\nColonial experts descending upon the planet. 

"I\'ll be the only one here\r\nthat hasn\'t learned to speak the language!"\r\n\r\n                                END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n


"I\'ll skin the guy alive!"\r\n\r\n      "Now, there, Jonathan!" the Skipper\r\n      Used to say, "Don\'t be a yipper.\r\n    I\'m sure Bill does the best he can." But grief\r\n      Etched gray, fretful lines and horrid\r\n      On McNeer\'s space-weathered forehead.\r\n    "The best is none too good!" complained the Chief.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\n      Two months out of Io City\r\n      Everything was running pretty,\r\n    The asteroids were thirty hours away,\r\n      When McNeer, to whom perfection\r\n      Was a sort of predilection,\r\n    Said, "Bill, we\'ll take the hypos down today."\r\n\r\n      Well, the hypatomic motors\r\n      Are the energy-plus rotors\r\n    That control a spaceship\'s motion in the void.\r\n      When the ship is once free-wheeling\r\n      \'Neath the vast celestial ceiling,\r\n    Then\'s the time to clean the grit with which they\'re cloyed.\r\n\r\n      So Bill said, "Yup. Okey-dokey!

"\r\n      And with movements slow and pokey\r\n    Dismounted Number one and got to work.\r\n      "Do a perfect job, you _globaar_!

[2]\r\n      Or I\'ll crown you with a crow-bar!"\r\n    Warned McNeer--and then he vanished with a smirk.\r\n\r\n      It was some two hours later\r\n      As, upon his "sweet pertater"\r\n    The Chief Engineer was tootling _Venus Nell_,\r\n      That the Second Mate, half witless,\r\n      Out of breath and frightened spitless,\r\n    Burst in crying, "Chief, we\'re on our way to hell!"\r\n\r\n      "What, already?" drawled McNeer\r\n      But the mate, pale green with fear,\r\n    Bawled, "Go get the hypos working, without fail!\r\n      And go do it on the double,\r\n      \'Cause we\'re in a peck of trouble!\r\n    A rogue asteroid is riding on our tail!"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IV\r\n\r\n      Now, in case you don\'t remember,\r\n      A "rogue asteroid\'s" a member\r\n    Of the minor planet group that\'s slipped its cogs.\r\n      Wrenched by gravitational forces,\r\n      It careens about its courses\r\n    In an orbit not computable by logs.\r\n\r\n      Tons on tons of granite, metaled,\r\n      By the tug of Jove unsettled,\r\n    Weaving in, about, below its normal belt;\r\n      Is it any wonder why a\r\n      Spaceman fears this mad pariah?\r\n    Dreads the moment when its power may be felt?\r\n\r\n      With a single, sharp, explosive\r\n      Word that acted as corrosive\r\n    On the mate\'s embarrassed eardrums, raced McNeer\r\n      To the engine-room where, peaceful,\r\n      Happy, busy, very grease-full,\r\n    Labored Blaster Bill, with grins from ear to ear.\r\n\r\n      "Bill!" McNeer cried, voice all blurry,\r\n      "Get that hypo in a hurry--"\r\n    Then his order strangled as he stared, aghast.\r\n      "What is this?" 

he faltered weakly,\r\n      "What is this?" And Bill, quite meekly,\r\n    Said, "I thought I\'d melt it down for a recast!"\r\n\r\n      His imagination racing\r\n      The Chief gazed upon the casing\r\n    Of the hypatomic motor Number Three,\r\n      Now a pool of molten metal\r\n      Bubbling gently in a kettle.\r\n    "Goddlemighty!" yelled McNeer. 

"This thing can\'t be!"\r\n\r\n      Bill asked, "Why the mad commotion?"\r\n      Then they glimpsed a sudden motion\r\n    And the Skipper\'s face was in the televise.\r\n      "Got the motors fixed, McNeer?"\r\n      And the Chief said, low and clear,\r\n    "No. Does someone know a prayer amongst you guys?

"\r\n\r\n      "Why?" the Skipper roared, distrait;\r\n      The Chief let him have it straight.\r\n    "The hypatomic\'s melted into wax!\r\n      But before that rogue gets near,\r\n      I\'ve a twelve pound hammer here\r\n    To warp across my blaster\'s parallax!"\r\n\r\n      "Wait!" the Captain cried, "Not yet!\r\n      We must cover every bet.\r\n    I\'m commander of this freighter while she rolls.\r\n      We must somehow make a turn,\r\n      Shake that damn rogue off our stern.\r\n    Suppose you try the manual controls?"\r\n\r\n      McNeer sadly shook his head\r\n      As he saw the rusty red\r\n    Of the long neglected manuals, but yelled,\r\n      "Hop to it, Bill, you dope!\r\n      It\'s our last and only hope--"\r\n    And then he stopped and gulped, "Well, I\'ll be helled!"\r\n\r\n      With his back arched neck to heel,\r\n      Bill was straining at the wheel;\r\n    The year-old rust was breaking off in flakes.\r\n      McNeer\'s eyes lit with joy,\r\n      He shouted, "Bill, my boy!\r\n    See, there, lad? She gives! 

She shakes!"\r\n\r\n      And true enough, the screw\r\n      Of the gallant _Dotty Sue_\r\n    Was turning \'neath the blaster\'s mighty brawn.\r\n      The C. E.\'s voice was thunder,\r\n      "We\'re getting out from under!\r\n    Just hold \'er, Bill; the danger will be gone!"\r\n\r\n      A moment, still as death,\r\n      While Bill the Blaster\'s breath\r\n    Rasped through the rocking room in tortured sobs,\r\n      Then from the bridge rang out\r\n      The Skipper\'s warning shout,\r\n    "Too late! Abandon ship, Chief! Don your lobs!"\r\n\r\n      McNeer said, "Too bad, Bill,\r\n      Just hold \'er there until\r\n    I get the lobs, and then we\'ll pull our freight."\r\n      With firm, untrembling hands\r\n      He took down from their stands\r\n    Two spacesuits, worn and old and out of date.\r\n\r\n      But Bill the Blaster stood\r\n      As motionless as wood;\r\n    His arms like knotted oak in cords of strain.\r\n      He slowly shook his head\r\n      And to the Chief he said,\r\n    "If all break ship, we\'ll not see Earth again."\r\n\r\n      "I know--" began McNeer,\r\n      But Bill roared out, "Stand clear!"\r\n    His arms upon the wheel were like a vise.\r\n      "Break ship and wait outside,\r\n      I\'ll make this baby ride!\r\n    I\'ll hold \'er till the devil skates on ice!"\r\n\r\n      Then in the visiplate\r\n      Appeared the Second Mate,\r\n    "All out below? Did you break ship, McNeer?"\r\n      McNeer said, "Right away!\r\n      Come on, Bill, don\'t delay!"\r\n    But Bill the Blaster panted, "Chief, stand clear!"\r\n\r\n      "You fool, you\'re courting death!"\r\n      Bill answered, "Save your breath,"\r\n    And grinned, "You\'ll need that oxygen outside!"\r\n      And stood like frozen steel\r\n      Beside that bucking wheel,\r\n    McNeer, reluctant, hovered at his side....\r\n\r\n      Till Bill cried, "You damn fool!"\r\n      And grabbed a handy tool\r\n    And slashed it \'cross his headpiece like a mace.\r\n      There came a crashing roar,\r\n      McNeer knew nothing more\r\n    Until he woke to find himself in space.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n\r\n      About him, staff and crew\r\n      Of the ill-starred _Dotty Sue_\r\n    Were huddled, bitter, grim, but unafraid.\r\n      A quarter mile away\r\n      The last scene of the fray\r\n    Tween Man and Asteroid was being played.\r\n\r\n      Her stern jets flaming white\r\n      Against the endless night\r\n    The bobbing ship was fighting, bolt and nail,\r\n      To curve from underneath\r\n      Those looming tons of death\r\n    That poised above her like a cosmic flail.\r\n\r\n      McNeer cried, "No, Bill! No!"\r\n      And then his audio\r\n    Clacked with the Skipper\'s thin, metallic voice,\r\n      "There\'s nothing we can do\r\n      But hope he pulls her through.\r\n    He made his choice, McNeer; a hero\'s choice."\r\n\r\n      As they watched tensely, all,\r\n      The spaceship seemed to crawl\r\n    An inch, a foot, a yard, another yard....\r\n      Meanwhile, the massive rock\r\n      Raced blindly toward the shock\r\n    With vast, colossal, cosmic disregard.\r\n\r\n      And nearer yet they drew,\r\n      To their strange _rendezvous_\r\n    In space; Fate\'s balance hovered fine and thin.\r\n      And then, "The Lord be praised!"\r\n      The crew a paean raised;\r\n    McNeer\'s white lips cracked in a nerveless grin.\r\n\r\n      Imponderable mass\r\n      And spaceship seemed to pass\r\n    Each other with a hair \'twixt hull and face;\r\n      But then, as every voice\r\n      Roused in a loud rejoice,\r\n    A single boulder slashed through empty space--\r\n\r\n      The spaceship buckled, bent;\r\n      A gaping, white-fanged rent\r\n    Split stern plates, and McNeer\'s voice cracked with fear.\r\n      "Board ship, all hands!" he cried!\r\n      "Bill\'s dying there inside!"\r\n    The wan sun watched the killer disappear.\r\n\r\n      McNeer was first to kneel\r\n      Beside the shattered wheel\r\n    And Bill\'s pale, silent figure; gray with grief\r\n      He cried, "He\'s breathing yet!\r\n      Here, Skipper! Help me get--"\r\n    But Bill said, "No--don\'t try to lift me, Chief."\r\n\r\n      "I look all right on top\r\n      But ... better get ... a mop....\r\n    My underneath part\'s not so good...." A chill\r\n      Ran through his broken frame,\r\n      But, to the last ditch game,\r\n    "I held \'er to \'er course--" said Blaster Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VI\r\n\r\n      So--hurtling \'round the Sun\r\n      On the perihelion run\r\n    Through the asteroids from Jupiter to Mars,\r\n      You may chance to see a light\r\n      In the everlasting night,\r\n    An unwinking beacon, sister to the stars.\r\n\r\n      And then, if you are not\r\n      A lousy _rankey-pot_,\r\n    With the instincts of the back end of a horse,\r\n      You\'ll stand a moment, mute,\r\n      Arm raised in full salute\r\n    To Blaster Bill--who held \'er to \'er course.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _rankey-pot_--Earthlubber; from the Venusian "_renqui-pth_"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _globaar_--shiftless person; Ionian term of reproach]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s The Ballad of Blaster Bill, by Nelson S.

she had\r\nreplied, and--_you think you know so doggone much_, she had thought.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Aunt Twylee!" She broke into a run. By the Joshua trees, through the\r\nstone gateway she ran, and with a leap she lit like a young frog on the\r\nporch. "Hi, Aunt Twylee!" she said breathlessly.\r\n\r\nAn ancient Martian woman sat in a rocking chair in the shade of the\r\nporch. She held a bowl of purple river apples in her lap. Her\r\npapyrus-like hands moved quickly as she shaved the skin from one. 

In a\r\nmatter of seconds it was peeled. She looked up over her bifocals at the\r\npanting Marilou.\r\n\r\n"Gracious, child, you shouldn\'t run like that this time of day," she\r\nsaid. "You Earth children aren\'t used to our Martian heat. It\'ll make\r\nyou sick if you run too much."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care! I hate Mars! Sometimes I wish I could just get good an\'\r\nsick, so\'s I\'d get to go home!

"\r\n\r\n"Marilou, you _are_ a little tyrant!" Aunt Twylee laughed.\r\n\r\n"Watcha\' doin\', Aunt Twylee?" Marilou asked, getting up from her frog\r\nposture and coming near the old Martian lady\'s chair.\r\n\r\n"Oh, peeling apples, dear. I\'m going to make a cobbler this afternoon."\r\nShe dropped the last apple, peeled, into the bowl. "There, done. Would\r\nyou like a little cool apple juice, Marilou?"\r\n\r\n"Sure--you betcha! Hey, could I watch you make the cobbler, Aunt Twylee,\r\ncould I? Mommy can\'t make it for anything--it tastes like glue. Maybe,\r\nif I could see how you do it, maybe I could show her. 

Do you think?"\r\n\r\n"Now, Marilou, your mother must be a wonderful cook to have raised such\r\na healthy little girl. I\'m sure there\'s nothing she could learn from\r\nme," Aunt Twylee said as she arose. "Let\'s go inside and have that\r\napple juice."\r\n\r\nThe kitchen was dark and cool, and filled with the odors of the\r\nwonderful edibles the old Martian had created on and in the Earth-made\r\nstove. She opened the Earth-made refrigerator that stood in the corner\r\nand withdrew an Earth-made bottle filled with Martian apple juice.\r\n\r\nMarilou jumped up on the table and sat cross-legged.\r\n\r\n"Here, dear." Aunt Twylee handed her a glass of the icy liquid.\r\n\r\n"Ummm, thanks," Marilou said, and gulped down half the contents. "That\r\ntastes dreamy, Aunt Twylee."\r\n\r\nThe little girl watched the old Martian as she lit the oven and gathered\r\nthe necessary ingredients for the cobbler. As she bent over to get a\r\nbowl from the shelf beneath Marilou\'s perch, her hair brushed against\r\nthe child\'s knee. Her hair was soft, soft and white as a puppy\'s, soft\r\nand white like the down from a dandelion. She smiled at Marilou. 

She\r\nalways smiled; her pencil-thin mouth was a perpetual arc.\r\n\r\nMarilou drained the glass. "Aunt Twylee--is it true what my daddy says\r\nabout the Martians?"\r\n\r\n"True? How can I say, dear? I don\'t know what he said."\r\n\r\n"Well, I mean, that when us Earth people came, you Martians did inf ...\r\ninfan ..."\r\n\r\n"Infanticide?" Aunt Twylee interrupted, rolling the dough on the board a\r\nlittle flatter, a little faster.\r\n\r\n"Yes, that\'s it--killed babies," Marilou said, and took an apple from\r\nthe bowl. "My daddy says you were real primitive, an\' killed your babies\r\nfor some silly religious reason. I think that\'s awful! How could it be\r\nreligious? God couldn\'t like to have little babies killed!" She took a\r\nbig bite of the apple; the juice ran from the corners of her mouth.\r\n\r\n"Your daddy is a very intelligent man, Marilou, but he\'s partially\r\nwrong. It is true--but not for religious reasons. It was a necessity.\r\nYou must remember, dear, Mars is very arid--sterile--unable to sustain\r\nmany living things. It _was_ awful, but it was the only way we knew to\r\ncontrol the population."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMarilou looked down her button nose as she picked a brown spot from the\r\napple. "Hmmph, I\'ll tell \'im he\'s wrong," she said. "He thinks he knows\r\nso damn much!"\r\n\r\n"Marilou!" Aunt Twylee exclaimed as she looked over her glasses. "A\r\nsweet child like you shouldn\'t use such language!"\r\n\r\nMarilou giggled and popped the remaining portion of the apple in her\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n"Do your parents know where you are, child?" Aunt Twylee asked, as she\r\ntook the bowl from Marilou\'s hands. She began dicing the apples into a\r\ndough-lined casserole.\r\n\r\n"No, they don\'t," Marilou replied. She sprayed the air with little\r\nparticles of apple as she talked. "Everybody\'s gone to the hills to look\r\nfor the boys."\r\n\r\n"The boys?" Aunt Twylee stopped her work and looked at the little girl.\r\n\r\n"Yes--Jimmy an\' Eddie an\' some of the others disappeared from the\r\nsettlement this morning. The men\'re afraid they\'ve run off to th\' hills\r\nan\' the renegades got \'em."\r\n\r\n"Gracious," Aunt Twylee said; her brow knitted into a criss-cross of\r\nwrinkles.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I know those dopes. They\'re prob\'ly down at th\' canals--fishin\' or\r\nsomep\'n."\r\n\r\n"Just the same, your mother will be frantic, dear. 

You should have told\r\nher where you were going."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care," Marilou said with unadulterated honesty. "She\'ll be all\r\nright when I get home."\r\n\r\nAunt Twylee shook her head and clucked her tongue.\r\n\r\n"Can I have another glass? Please?

"\r\n\r\nThe old lady poured the glass full again. And then she sprinkled sugar\r\ndown among the apple cubes in the casserole and covered them with a\r\nblanket of dough. She cut an uneven circle of half moons in it and put\r\nit in the oven. "There--all ready to bake, Marilou," she sighed.\r\n\r\n"It looks real yummy, Aunt Twylee."\r\n\r\n"Well, I certainly hope it turns out good, dear," she said, wiping her\r\nforehead with her apron. She looked out the open back door. The\r\nlandscape was beginning to gray as heavier clouds moved down from the\r\nmountains and pressed the afternoon heat closer, more oppressively to\r\nthe ground. "My, it\'s getting hot. I wouldn\'t be a bit surprised if we\r\ndidn\'t get a little rain this afternoon, Marilou." She turned back to\r\nthe little girl. 

"Tell me some more about your daddy, dear. We Martians\r\ncertainly owe a lot to men like your father."\r\n\r\n"That\'s what he says too. He says, you Martians would have died out\r\nin a few years, if we hadn\'t come here. We\'re so much more civi ...\r\ncivili ..."\r\n\r\n"Civilized?"\r\n\r\n"Yeah. He says, we were so much more \'civ-ilized\' than you that we saved\r\nyour lives when we came here with all our modern stuff."\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s true enough, dear. 

Just look at that wonderful Earth\r\nstove," Aunt Twylee said, and laughed. "We wouldn\'t be able to bake an\r\napple cobbler like that without it, would we?

"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA rumble of thunder shouldered through the crowded hot air.\r\n\r\n"No. He says, you Martians are kinda likeable, but you can\'t be trusted.\r\nHe\'s nuts! _I_ like you Martians!"\r\n\r\n"Thank you, child, but everyone\'s entitled to his own opinion. Don\'t\r\njudge your daddy too severely," Aunt Twylee said as she scraped spilled\r\nsugar from the table and put little bits of it on her tongue.\r\n\r\n"He says that you\'d bite th\' hand that feeds you. He says, we brought\r\nall these keen things to Mars, an\' that if you got th\' chance, you\'d\r\nkill all of us!"\r\n\r\n"Gracious," said Aunt Twylee as she speared scraps of dough with the\r\npoint of her long paring knife.\r\n\r\n"He\'s a dope!" Marilou said.\r\n\r\nAunt Twylee opened the oven and peeked in at the cobbler. The aroma of\r\nthe simmering apples rushed out and filled the room.\r\n\r\n"Could I have some cobbler when it\'s done?" Marilou asked, her mouth\r\nfilling with saliva.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid not, child. 

It\'s getting rather late."\r\n\r\nThe thunder rumbled again--a little closer, a little louder.\r\n\r\nThe old lady washed the blade of the knife in the sink. "Tell me more of\r\nwhat your father says, dear," she said as she adjusted the bifocals on\r\nher thin nose and ran her thumb along the length of the knife\'s blade.\r\n\r\n"Oh, nothin\' much more. He just says that you\'d kill us if you had th\'\r\nchance. That\'s the way the inferior races always act, he says. They want\r\nto kill th\' people that help \'em, \'cause they resent \'em."\r\n\r\n"Very interesting.

"\r\n\r\n"Well, it isn\'t so, is it, Aunt Twylee?"\r\n\r\nThe room was filled with blinding blue-white light, and the walls quaked\r\nat the sound of a monstrous thunderclap.\r\n\r\nThe old Martian glanced nervously at the clock on the wall. "My, it _is_\r\ngetting late," she said as she fondled the knife in her hands.\r\n\r\n"You Martians wouldn\'t do anything like that, would you?"\r\n\r\n"You want the truth, don\'t you, dear?" Aunt Twylee asked, smiling, as\r\nshe walked to the table where Marilou sat.\r\n\r\n"\'Course I do, Aunt Twylee," she said.\r\n\r\nHer scream was answered and smothered by the horrendous roar of the\r\nthunder, and the piercing hiss of the rain that fell in sheets. In great\r\nvolumes of water, it fell, as though the heavens were attempting to wash\r\nthe sins of man from the universe and into non-existence in the void\r\nbeyond the void.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMarilou lay beside the other children. Aunt Twylee smiled at them,\r\nclosed the bedroom door and returned to the kitchen.\r\n\r\nThe storm had moved on; the thunder was the faint grumbling of a\r\npacified old man. What water fell was a monotonous trickle from the\r\neaves of the lime-washed stone house. Aunt Twylee washed the blood from\r\nthe knife and wiped it dry on her apron. She opened the oven and took\r\nout the browned cobbler. Sweet apple juice bubbled to the surface\r\nthrough the half moons and burst in delights of sugary aroma. The sun\r\nbroke through the thinning edge of the thunderhead.\r\n\r\nAunt Twylee brushed a lock of her feathery white hair from her moist\r\ncheek. "Gracious," she said, "I must tidy up a bit before the others\r\ncome."\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _If Worlds of Science Fiction_ July\r\n    1953.

]\r\n\r\n\r\nKlon fled from fern to fern like a drifting shadow, circling the new\r\nclearing that had been torn in the steamy jungle by the gleaming\r\nmonster that had come from the eternal fog that clothed his world. He\r\nhalted now and then, slipped into the stagnant water that covered nine\r\ntenths of the planet, and listened for the slightest sound that would\r\nwarn him of a hidden watcher spying on his movements.\r\n\r\nSatisfied that he was alone in the jungle swamp, he edged closer to the\r\nclearing whose edge was a charred and ragged circle. His lidless eye\r\ngleamed phosphorescently in the darkness that never changed, bringing\r\ninto sharp detail the shadows that were two shades of blackness for\r\nthere were no colors on his earth.\r\n\r\nHe slipped over the burned ground, wincing at the bruises given him by\r\nthe unaccustomed hardness beneath his body. He hissed a bit in anger\r\nthat he should suffer so, then went rigid as the thing happened again.\r\n\r\nAn amazingly light shadow had suddenly come into being on the roundness\r\nof the gleaming visitor from somewhere above.\r\n\r\nKlon wanted that shadow, wanted that thing that was brighter than\r\nanything he had ever seen--and his purpose was to gain it in any way\r\npossible. For possession of that light shadow would make him greater\r\nthan anyone else on the planet. Mightier even than Valok.\r\n\r\nKlon knew that his time was growing short; the nation would declare\r\ntheir new leader within a very short while, and he knew that possession\r\nof that light shadow was the one thing that would assure him of victory\r\nover his rival for leadership.\r\n\r\nHis gills opened and closed automatically, involuntary muscles working\r\neven when his lungs worked on the damp air. He winced a bit from the\r\nlightness of the shadow, for never had his eye seen one that was so\r\nwithout blackness.\r\n\r\nAnd then Klon was at the roundness of the thing, the touch of its\r\ncoolness sending a thrill of dread through his heart. He moved slowly\r\nuntil he was just below the circle of lightness, then climbed upwards\r\nwith his sucker-discs.\r\n\r\nSlowly, carefully, instantly ready for flight to safety, he lifted his\r\nhead until his eye was pressed against the light shadow. He felt tiny\r\npains running through his eye, back into his head, and down into his\r\nbody, but he gave it no heed.\r\n\r\nFor he was seeing something that none other of his race had had the\r\ncourage to face. He saw things but dimly, and the hideousness of the\r\nscene almost made him lose his hold.\r\n\r\nFor nightmarish creatures moved within the gleaming thing, moving on\r\nstiff tentacles, gesturing with others, while above, on a thin neck,\r\nfanged mouths opened and closed in sickening motions. And the shadows\r\nof their skins were of shades of lightness and darkness that were\r\nterrifying to Klon\'s senses that had never met the like before.\r\n\r\nHe gasped audibly, swung back from the circle of lightness, shaking\r\nwith horror at what he had seen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nInside the gleaming space ship, three men were seated on the\r\ncollapsible bunks. Kurt Overland, his muscular body unclad except for\r\nshorts, was speaking in his even tone.\r\n\r\n"Well," he said cheerfully, even his steady voice failing to conceal\r\nthe burning eagerness within him, "we\'re finally ready. 

I\'ve just made\r\nthe last repair on the things broken by landing."\r\n\r\nFrank Barker grinned at him from across the cell-like room, stretched\r\nhis six feet of blond-topped, lanky strength happily.\r\n\r\n"Suits me," he said, "I\'m tired of being cooped in this animated bullet\r\nthat\'s been home for so long."\r\n\r\n"We had to wait," gray-haired Professor Kent said mildly, "After all,\r\nif we are met by hostile beings, we want to be able to escape."\r\n\r\nKurt Overland grinned. "Maybe you\'re right, Professor," he said. "But\r\nI\'d hate to return to Earth and say that we\'d been run off before we\r\nhad a chance to bring back proof of our expedition\'s success."\r\n\r\n"That would be a calamity," Barker broke in. "Remember what a devil of\r\na time we had getting permission to make this flight through space.\r\nThe President told me, just before we took off, that because of the\r\nmany deaths in faulty rockets a law was being passed to forbid any more\r\nflights. He said that it was only his influence that made it possible\r\nfor us to leave Earth on a trip to Venus, and that if we failed to make\r\ngood there would probably be no more flights for, possibly, hundreds of\r\nyears."\r\n\r\n"So!" Professor Kent nodded his head. "Then I am glad that we did not\r\nfail; for it is apparent that we are the vanguard of a new phase of our\r\ncivilization."\r\n\r\nKurt Overland stood, flexed his arms. "Well, come on, let\'s go," he\r\nsaid. 

"It\'s time we took a look around."\r\n\r\nThe three of them slipped into their space suits, each of them\r\ntight-breathed with eagerness to explore the second of the planets.\r\nThey were strangely silent as they dressed.\r\n\r\n"Better slip the cover over that radi-light," Professor Kent tried to\r\nkeep his tone even. "There may be poisonous insects outside that would\r\nbe attracted by it. 

We will go outside without lights, then switch them\r\non when the port is closed."\r\n\r\nFrank Barker moved toward the radi-light, slipped the cover over its\r\neternal brightness with a gloved hand. Then he joined the other two\r\nat the port. For a long second the three of them stood shoulder to\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n"Professor Kent," Kurt Overland said softly, "please go first. It is\r\nyour right that you should be the first to step onto a world made\r\naccessible only by your genius."\r\n\r\nProfessor Albert Kent\'s shoulders shook silently for a moment in great\r\nemotion, then straightened with pride. He nodded, swung shut his visor\r\nplate, dogged it securely.\r\n\r\nBarker and Overland followed suit, clicked on their radio receivers.\r\nThey waited patiently for their leader, knowing the feelings that must\r\nhave been his at the moment.\r\n\r\nAnd then, unsealing the port, clutching the American flag gently in\r\nhis left hand ready for its planting on Venus, Professor Kent stepped\r\nthrough the port, the first human to land on the veiled planet. Behind\r\nhim, following with a clumsy speed, came Frank Barker and Kurt Overland.\r\n\r\n"We three--" Professor Albert Kent began.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKlon dropped from the side of the ship.\r\n\r\nHe paused for a moment over the lifeless bodies of the three intrepid\r\nexplorers, then moved away, disgusted by his closeness to the horrible\r\ncreatures he had slain so swiftly and casually.\r\n\r\nHis every sense was alert for the slightest movement on the long\r\ngleaming thing beside him to retaliate in quick vengeance for the\r\nslaying of the things that lived within its belly.\r\n\r\nKlon crouched there for moments, then moved toward the ship. He climbed\r\ninto the port entrance, leaving a thick trail of slime in his wake. He\r\nmoved eagerly toward the small hole in the opposite wall, his heart\r\nthudding with bursting eagerness.\r\n\r\nHe had seen Frank Barker slip the shield over the shadow that was so\r\nunlike anything on his earth. And now he moved through the darkness of\r\nthe space ship, slipping surely through a darkness that was natural to\r\nhim and his fellow creatures.\r\n\r\nHe lifted the small box from its recess, turned and sped from the ship,\r\nvague terror and superstition overcoming the courage that had taken\r\nso long to build to a white heat. He rushed past the men who slept\r\nthe eternal sleep before the port of their ship, slipped into the\r\nwarm water at the edge of the clearing, began his long journey to the\r\nmeeting place at which a leader would be chosen.\r\n\r\nHe clasped the box close to him as he raced through the swampy jungle,\r\nafraid that it might disappear before he could reach his destination.\r\nHe did not pause to examine his prize, knowing that the time was\r\ngrowing short, feeling certain a longer wait would only make the globe\r\nof lightness more thrilling.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe people of Klon\'s nation were gathered in the Council Clearing,\r\nsilent as each of the candidates for leader extolled his own virtues\r\nand explained his qualification for the position as their leader.\r\n\r\nHisses of approval and sounds of disapproval greeted each candidate as\r\nhe placed himself on the stone at the clearing\'s center.\r\n\r\nAnd then Klon slipped into the clearing. He hissed greetings as he made\r\nhis way to the central stone. Still clutching the box tightly to his\r\nbody, he climbed to the top of the stone, faced his nation.\r\n\r\nA respectful silence fell as his powerful body loomed high in the air\r\nover the heads of his people.\r\n\r\nKlon stood for a moment, silently considering the short speech he\r\nintended to make. He caught the glance of Valok\'s eye, looked away.\r\nHis gaze travelled over the clearing, making out familiar features of\r\nhis people.\r\n\r\nThe crowd was not large, for Klon\'s nation was a small one. It was\r\nlarge in the sense that no other group on the planet was as large. And\r\nit was the only race with useful intelligence.\r\n\r\nKlon looked at his people, and pride made his heart beat even faster.\r\n\r\n"I am here to prove to you that I am the mightiest among you," he\r\nhissed. "I have here the thing that will prove what I say." 

He lifted\r\nthe small box so that everyone could see.\r\n\r\nA wave of interested hissing grew in sudden applause, then a respectful\r\nsilence fell again. Klon hesitated for a moment longer, then continued:\r\n\r\n"I got this thing from the belly of the thing that came from the\r\nclouds, killing three horrible creatures single-handedly. Thus I have\r\nproved that I am clever, brave and strong."\r\n\r\n"What is this thing you have brought us, Brave Klon?" Valok\'s sneering\r\nhiss broke in upon Klon\'s words.\r\n\r\n"A thing that is like nothing any of you have ever seen; it is a shadow\r\nlighter than anything on this world," Klon said proudly, and placed the\r\nsmall box on the rock beside himself.\r\n\r\nHe paused again, knowing the effect his wait would have on his\r\naudience. And then he whisked the cover from the radi-light, slid from\r\nthe central stone.\r\n\r\nThe radi-light flared with a dazzling, gleaming whiteness on the\r\nstone, bringing with it a light such as had never penetrated the\r\nalways-present clouds that veiled Venus. Klon stood proudly to one\r\nside, drinking in the hissing applause and hisses of surprise and awe\r\nthat greeted his showing of the globe of light shadow. He knew then\r\nthat he had won the coveted leadership of his nation.\r\n\r\n"This," he hissed over the uproar of his people, "is the--"\r\n\r\nKlon gasped in sudden intolerable agony, fiery fingers of pain tearing\r\nat every bit of his body, cutting off his speech almost at its very\r\ninception. He crumpled slowly to the ground, dimly conscious that other\r\ncries were echoing his own.\r\n\r\nHe died then, hearing the agonized hisses of his friends, his last\r\nsight of life being that of the globe that burned with a white-hot\r\nlight on the top of the central stone.\r\n\r\nAnd slowly, but with increasing speed, his people died too. They fell\r\nlike tiny trees before a huge storm, falling even as they tried to find\r\na reason for the death around them. 

Like a wave eddying out from the\r\ncentral stone, death cut its merciless sweep.\r\n\r\nAnd within seconds there was no life in the clearing. Within seconds\r\nan entire nation, every intelligent being on Venus, was dead of the\r\nunleashed light rays, the like of which had never penetrated the miles\r\nof fog that lay between earth and the sun.\r\n\r\nThe radi-light gleamed brightly on the central stone, shedding radiance\r\nover the last beings of intelligence ever to be on Venus--perhaps\r\nforever!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s The Victory of Klon, by Wilbur S.

You don\'t miss\r\na thing."\r\n\r\n_I can\'t afford to_, the alien\'s telepathic voice said. _The first rule\r\nin thievery is never to trust an accomplice._\r\n\r\n"That makes sense," Kiley admitted. "Only there\'s no way I can escape\r\nyou--not when you can telepath anywhere in the galaxy. How do I get to\r\nyour planet?"\r\n\r\n_Don\'t trouble yourself. Simply blast off and I\'ll assume mental\r\ncontrol of your ship once you\'re out in space. I\'d prefer that the\r\nlocation of my world remain a secret even to you._\r\n\r\nKiley shrugged. "Okay. 

I won\'t argue. 

I\'m blasting off now."\r\n\r\nHe jabbed down on the firing stud.\r\n\r\nThe stolen spaceship sprang up into the void, and Kiley felt the\r\nalien\'s mental emanations enfolding him, seizing control of the ship,\r\nguiding it--just as, a month before, similar emanations had come to\r\nhim in the darkness of a jail cell in the Under-Dungeon of Alpheraz VII.\r\n\r\nThey had nailed him for a bungled burglary--he\'d have made it, all\r\nright, except that he hadn\'t foreseen one of the new-model psionic\r\nalarms--and, since he was a four-timer, they\'d stuck him in solitary\r\ndeep in the dank heart of the planet.\r\n\r\nThe guard, a thick-muscled Alpherazian with three cold, slitted eyes,\r\nhad hurled him into the cell, thrown him sprawling against the slimy\r\nstone.\r\n\r\n"That ought to hold you, Kiley!" the Alpherazian growled. 

"You\'ve\r\nstolen your last jewel, Earthman."\r\n\r\n"Get out of here!" Kiley said thinly. "Don\'t stand here and gloat. I\'d\r\nbe free and out of here if that crazy alarm hadn\'t popped off."\r\n\r\nThe guard chuckled. "Relax and cool off, Kiley. You\'ve got plenty of\r\ntime to get used to your new home."\r\n\r\nThe door clanged shut. Kiley spat in the darkness as he heard the bolt\r\nslipping home--the unbreakable, foolproof bolt of the escape proof\r\nAlpheraz jail. And then--\r\n\r\n_How would you like to be free in five minutes?_ a voice asked.\r\n\r\n"Huh? Who\'s there?" Kiley looked around, narrowing his eyes to see in\r\nthe foggy blackness, but there was no one within sight.\r\n\r\n_Don\'t strain your eyes_, the voice said--and Kiley realized it was an\r\nunspoken voice in his mind. _I\'m a thousand light-years away. The name\r\nis Thaklaru._\r\n\r\n"Who are you? _What_ are you?

"\r\n\r\n_That doesn\'t concern you. I need your professional services, and I\r\nhave a proposition to make._\r\n\r\n"Go ahead," Kiley said, mystified.\r\n\r\n_You\'re a jewel-thief--and a good one. I can aid you in such a way that\r\nyou\'ll be a perfect one._\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n_How would you like the power of instant hypnosis?_ the alien asked.\r\n_You could go anywhere you liked--simply by convincing people you\r\nbelonged there. My mind, projected out through the focus of yours,\r\ncould do this thing. We could work as partners, and divide fifty-fifty._\r\n\r\n"Hold on," said Kiley suspiciously. "What do you need _me_ for, then?\r\nIf you\'ve got this power, why not just rob whatever you want yourself?"\r\n\r\nThere was the voiceless equivalent of a chuckle. _I do not like to\r\nleave my home world. You will act as my travelling--ah--agent._\r\n\r\n"Sounds good to me," Kiley said. "I\'ve got nothing to lose, anyway. 

But\r\nhow do I get out of here?"\r\n\r\n_A simple matter. 

Just be patient._\r\n\r\nKiley waited. A few minutes later, the Alpherazian jailer showed\r\nup--but the look of scorn was gone from his eyes.\r\n\r\n"Dreadfully sorry, Mr. Smith," the guard said humbly. "There\'s been\r\nsome mistake here--we thought you were someone else. Naturally, we\'ll\r\nindemnify you for this inconvenience."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all right," Kiley said casually. "Mistakes _do_ happen, you\r\nknow."\r\n\r\n"This way, please. 

We\'re terribly sorry about the whole affair."\r\n\r\nKiley smiled as the guard led him out of the cell-block to freedom.\r\n_You\'re a man of your word, Thaklaru_, he thought. _It\'s a deal._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOnce free, Kiley had spent a very pleasant three weeks on Alpheraz\r\nVII. Thaklaru\'s mind was with him at all times--and with his power of\r\ninstant hypnosis, all doors were open to him. It was a simple matter.\r\n\r\nThe big coup came when Kiley grew tired of the planet\'s pleasures. He\r\ntravelled to the Emperor\'s palace.\r\n\r\nThe guards bowed to him as he approached. "Good afternoon, your\r\nmajesty!"\r\n\r\nKiley smiled politely and kept on going. He walked quickly through the\r\npalace, stopping only to ask a butler where the jewel-room was.\r\n\r\nAs it turned out, the Emperor himself was in the jewel-room. "Pardon\r\nme, your majesty," Kiley said. "I\'ll have to have some of these, I\'m\r\nafraid."\r\n\r\nThe monarch looked up, met Kiley\'s eye, and froze. "Of course," he\r\nsaid politely. 

"Go right ahead." And he stood to one side while Kiley\r\nplundered the crown jewels.\r\n\r\nFrom there, he travelled to the spaceport outside the city, where he\r\ncommandeered a small one-man ship by asking its pilot to leave. Guided\r\nby Thaklaru, he arranged for clearance and blasted off.\r\n\r\nIt had been simple. Terribly, terribly simple--almost dull, Kiley\r\nreflected, as his ship sped through space toward Thaklaru\'s home world.\r\nHe wondered idly what his partner-in-crime looked like. A grotesque\r\npulsating slug floating in a bath of some slimy fluid, perhaps? It\r\nwould have to be something along those lines, Kiley thought--something\r\nthat would keep Thaklaru from entering the worlds of the galaxy by\r\nhimself and taking whatever he pleased.\r\n\r\n"We make a good team, Thaklaru," Kiley said aloud.\r\n\r\n_True_, the alien said. _With my power and your agility, we could steal\r\nanything the galaxy contained._\r\n\r\nKiley turned and looked at the heap of jewels again. Two million\r\nstellors! Quickly, he computed the value in Earth currency, and gasped.\r\nThe haul was worth nearly ten billion dollars!\r\n\r\nPerspiration broke out all over him. He tried frantically not to think\r\nwhat he was thinking, but there was no way to keep the thoughts from\r\nflooding into his mind.\r\n\r\nHe heard Thaklaru chuckling. _No, Kiley. There\'s no way you can cheat\r\nme of my share of the wealth._\r\n\r\n"Dammit, Thaklaru, do you have to keep listening to my mind? Can\'t I\r\nhave a _little_ privacy?"\r\n\r\n_Don\'t fear, Kiley. Your reaction is a perfectly understandable one,\r\nand I hold no rancor against you for desiring great wealth. I expect\r\nyou to think that way--which is why I keep listening to you. I never\r\ntrust an accomplice, remember._\r\n\r\nA new thought entered Kiley\'s mind. "Say--what do you _need_ these\r\njewels for? Seems to me you could have anything you wanted, money no\r\nobject--so why do you want to be rich?"\r\n\r\n_Rich? I do not want to be rich. The jewels are pretty, though--and I\r\nlike beautiful things. I covet them for purely esthetic reasons._\r\n\r\n"Okay with me," Kiley said. "I have more practical ends in mind.

"\r\n\r\n_It is understandable. Ah--you are approaching my home world now.\r\nPlease prepare for deceleration._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn hour later, Kiley stood on the soil of Thaklaru\'s planet and looked\r\naround.\r\n\r\n_Welcome_, the alien\'s voice said.\r\n\r\nKiley stood by the side of his spaceship and stared at the awesome\r\nsight. A vast chain of naked mountains sprang up like a row of\r\ngigantic teeth to the east--bare, jagged peaks stretching up into dim\r\nimmensity, twenty and thirty and forty thousand feet in air. 

Wild\r\nsavage-looking vegetation swept fiercely around him, trees well over a\r\nthousand feet high and looking to be a block wide at their base. Just\r\nat a distance of a few feet, a monstrous cliff reared straight upward\r\ntoward the swirling black-and-gold clouds. It was a strange and utterly\r\nprimitive world.\r\n\r\n"Okay, I\'m here!" Kiley shouted. "Where are you?"\r\n\r\n_I will be with you soon_, the alien responded. _Take the jewels from\r\nthe ship._\r\n\r\n"How do I decide which are yours and which are mine?"\r\n\r\n_Take them all. We will decide once they are out of the ship._\r\n\r\nA sudden ripple of terror ran through Kiley, turning the little\r\njewel-thief cold. He felt dwarfed by the sheer magnitude of Thaklaru\'s\r\nworld. He wondered where the alien was, what sort of creature he might\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n_Your curiosity will soon be ended_, Thaklaru said. _When you have\r\nbrought the jewels out, I will appear._\r\n\r\nKiley shrugged and started to climb the catwalk that led into the ship.\r\nThere was little sense in trying to argue with Thaklaru\'s abilities;\r\nif he didn\'t go willingly, the alien would only force him. He gathered\r\nthe jewels into a double handful and brought them back outside,\r\ndropping them onto a bare patch of reddish-green soil. Returning, he\r\nbrought the rest of them out.\r\n\r\n"Okay," he said. "They\'re all there."\r\n\r\n_Good. They are lovely._\r\n\r\n"Suppose you show up and let\'s divide these things," Kiley said. "I\'m\r\ntired of your mental voice--let\'s hear the real thing."\r\n\r\n_Very well._\r\n\r\nA clap of thunder seemed to split the sky--a deafening, booming noise\r\nthat made the ground quiver. Kiley cowered in fright as the sound was\r\nrepeated--and this time, he was able to detect words.\r\n\r\n"I am Thaklaru!"\r\n\r\n"Where are you?"\r\n\r\n"Look upward!" the booming voice cried.\r\n\r\nHesitantly, Kiley turned his gaze upward--and gasped. The "cliff" he\r\nhad thought stood next to him was no cliff at all. It was a vast alien\r\ncreature, stony and terrifying, whose head vanished in the fuzzy clouds\r\nfar overhead.\r\n\r\nAgain came the booming noise: "I am Thaklaru!"\r\n\r\n"I see why you needed an accomplice," Kiley said in a weak voice.\r\n"Something--someone of your size--"\r\n\r\n"Yes. I could never venture into anything as tiny as one of your\r\ncities.

"\r\n\r\nKiley licked his lips nervously. "Well--here are the jewels.\r\nLet\'s--let\'s divide them!"\r\n\r\n"One bit of business first," the alien\'s thunderous boom came. "You\r\nhave served well--but you cannot live."\r\n\r\n"_What?_"\r\n\r\n"It is necessary, Kiley. There are ways of extracting information from\r\na man\'s subconscious--and I would not have my existence known."\r\n\r\nSuddenly the sky was black. Kiley looked up and saw what could only be\r\na foot--a monstrous, horrible foot--blotting out the sunlight overhead.\r\n\r\n"I warned you, Kiley--never trust an accomplice. And _I_ was your\r\naccomplice."\r\n\r\nThe sky rang with the gigantic alien\'s cosmic laughter. Kiley covered\r\nhis ears to blot out the hideous sound. Tears of rage flooded his eyes.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not fair! It\'s--"\r\n\r\n"Sorry, Kiley."\r\n\r\n_Like an ant_, the thief thought bitterly. _I\'m dying like an ant._\r\n\r\nAnd then the great foot came down.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was three in the afternoon and quitting time at Utopian Appliances,\r\nInc. Bertram J. Bernard, the firm\'s stocky, thick-jawed president,\r\nwaited discreetly at his desk for a few minutes, then closed the file\r\nhe had been studying, bid his secretary a pleasant evening, and strode\r\ncalmly out of the office.\r\n\r\nHe did not want to appear eager, and succeeded superbly in that.\r\nJoining several junior executives, he conversed genially with them\r\nas they descended to the rapid-transit floor. Three of the bright,\r\nconfident young men decided to stop for a quick one at the building\'s\r\nplush saloon. Well, that was okay--Bernard had been a late-runner in\r\nhis youth. But now, well into middle age, he had learned that life had\r\nother demands and pleasures.\r\n\r\n"Have a good run, B. B.," said Watkins, the treasurer, at the rap-tran\r\ngate. "Gloria\'s coming in on the three-thirty and we\'re going to dinner\r\nand then some musical or other she\'s been dying to see."\r\n\r\nSo Bernard entered the rap-tran alone, though surrounded by scores of\r\npushing, jabbering strangers. Finding a seat on the aisle, next to a\r\nelectronics company vice-president whom he knew slightly, he engaged\r\nin trade conversation during the five minutes it took the monorail to\r\nreach his stop. He and the electronics executive got off, as did about\r\nhalf of the rap-trans passengers, mostly middle-aged men like himself.\r\nEarly-runners.\r\n\r\nThe escalator from the monorail stop descended directly into the\r\nJungle Station beneath. In the large lobby the crowd dispersed and\r\nBernard was again alone when he reached the dressing rooms. This was\r\nnot surprising, he reflected; not many members of his Jungle Station\r\ncould afford the elaborate private locker unique to this wing of the\r\nbuilding. He pressed his thumbprint to the lock and the door slid back.\r\n\r\nInside, he undressed completely, noting with critical satisfaction the\r\nstrength and color of his body in the full-length mirror at one end of\r\nthe locker. He quickly packed his clothes, shoes, and briefcase into a\r\nsmall suitcase, with delivery instructions on the top. Then he climbed\r\ninto his jungle suit--knee-length shorts, sweat shirt, rubber-soled\r\nshoes, and hip holster.\r\n\r\nHe checked the frequency setting on the sonic pistol, adjusting it to\r\nthe panthers who were reported in ascendancy. As a last thought, merely\r\na whim, he glanced down at the station emblem on his sweat shirt, just\r\nto enjoy the sense of pride he derived from the large red "U-F" above\r\nit.\r\n\r\nOf course there were getting to be more and more ulcer-frees these\r\ndays, but that did not make it any less a matter for pride. And anyway\r\nseveral factions were pressing determinedly for a neurosis-free\r\ninsignia. 

Though there were complications there. Oh, well, the\r\nimportant thing\'s the run, he remembered.\r\n\r\nIn the lobby again he deposited his suitcase at the delivery window.\r\nThen he stopped at the bulletin board to read the ascendancy ratings\r\nfor the day. These were official, therefore several days outdated, but\r\none could extrapolate. Panthers were dropping into third position,\r\nbehind polar bears, with giraffes at the top by a good margin.\r\n\r\nOutside the building he ran into a tipster and decided he had best buy\r\na dope sheet. He gave the seedy little man a dollar bill and looked\r\nover the page.\r\n\r\n"Keep it right where you got it, Mac," the man whispered hoarsely,\r\nnodding toward the pistol at Bernard\'s side. "I got it straight, dem\r\npant\'ers is all over de place. 

Watch out at de water hole, specially."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGlancing swiftly over the page, Bernard saw that fifty panthers had\r\nentered this sector of the jungle overnight, with a herd of fifteen\r\ngiraffes headed well toward the south. But he also noted that there\r\nhad been three deaths from polar bears in the past week in his sector\r\nalone. Fortunately, the frequency readjustment from panthers to polar\r\nbears was an easy one, three clicks clockwise with the thumb. He would\r\nhave to remember about the water hole, though it was either that or\r\ngoing above the rapids. The sharks below the rapids were pretty thick\r\nduring the summer.\r\n\r\n"Thanks, bud," he told the tipster. Then he strode, still calm, to\r\nthe wall. Expertly he clambered up its handholds, till he reached the\r\ntop, thirty feet from the ground. On the other side lay the jungle,\r\nits lush tropical growth hiding from his alert eyes the danger that\r\nlurked within. He popped a Verve pill into his mouth and chewed on it\r\nthoughtfully.\r\n\r\nFar in the distance, some five miles at the narrowest point, rose the\r\nouter wall. Between the two prowled a variety of ambivalent robot\r\nbeasts, now ready to dismember him, but on weekends adjusted to\r\ntake small boys and girls for short rides or simply to stalk about\r\npicturesquely.\r\n\r\nDrawing his pistol and placing it between his teeth, Bernard leaped to\r\nthe ground between the wall and a large low palm. At once the pistol\r\nwas again in his hand. 

But nothing moved. Now he could see clearly the\r\npath he must take.\r\n\r\nBending low, he trotted along through the undergrowth. It soon began\r\nto clear, and still no danger in sight. He holstered the pistol and\r\nadvanced, half-walking, half-running, till he could hear the hiss of\r\nthe rapids. Enough noise to mask the sounds of a dozen panthers, he\r\nthought. But it covered his own footsteps, too, and panthers were more\r\nphonotropic than polar bears, the latter having a preference for radar\r\nspotting.\r\n\r\nCoyotes were the worst, of course, with their damned infrared\r\nthermo-sensors. They could spot a runner even when he was in cover.\r\nFortunately they were scarce and getting more so. Bernard had only\r\nencountered a coyote twice, deactivating it both times. But he had been\r\nlucky. He recalled the story about that city councilman....\r\n\r\nAn hour later he arrived at the river, a half-mile above the rapids\r\nand well away from the water hole. He had seen only one beast in the\r\nfirst three miles of his trek, a giraffe hobbling along in olfactory\r\npursuit of another runner far to the right. Giraffes were mainly a\r\nnuisance, though they could kick and trample a man. Bernard had heard\r\nof such a thing happening, but it was a rarity. They were too easy to\r\nelude.\r\n\r\nHe crossed the river on a log raft he found, which had evidently been\r\nrigged to dump him in about halfway across. At least he had got that\r\nfar on it he told himself, as he struck out for the shore. For one\r\nhorrible moment he thought he detected a shark upstream, but it was\r\nmerely the shadow of a large palm leaf. He had a strong and sensible\r\nfear of sharks.\r\n\r\nA mile farther found him crawling over the rocky ground as the growls\r\nof panthers reached his acute ears from behind a ridge of brush. If\r\nthey heard him, they ignored him, perhaps more interested in other\r\nquarry. His knees and arms were scraped but not bleeding, and at last\r\nhe was able to get to his feet to make better time.\r\n\r\nIt was then that he heard the girl\'s scream.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNo regulation in the rule book discriminated against women becoming\r\nrunners, but only a few of the millions who worked at offices and\r\nplants in the city did so. Also there was nothing in the code about\r\nhelping other runners. Each was entirely on his own, free to help or\r\nbe helped, or not helped, if he chose.\r\n\r\nBernard would never have called for help for himself. But the sound of\r\nthe woman\'s cry appealed to another side of his nature. 

He changed his\r\ndirection, but moved with great caution now. Soon he saw her, and froze.\r\n\r\nShe was clad as he, different sector emblem, but the same proudly borne\r\n"U-F" on her sweater. Her face and body were young and attractive, but\r\nher long dark hair was tangled and wet, and her limbs mud-spattered.\r\nShe had screamed only once, and now her small lipsticked mouth hung\r\nopen with terror.\r\n\r\nBacked against a tree, she gaped in horror, waiting, as three panthers\r\napproached from as many directions. Her sonic lay on the ground outside\r\nthe circle. It was obvious that she was finished if Bernard did not\r\nassist her.\r\n\r\nRaising his hand till the pistol sight was where he wanted it, he\r\nmodified the angle adjustment till all of the animals were within\r\nits range. Then he depressed the trigger several times. Two fell and\r\nthe third animal leaped at the girl. But she twisted around the tree\r\nand Bernard picked off the panther as it readied itself for a second\r\nspring. At once the girl dived for her pistol. Proper response, Bernard\r\nthought approvingly. Then she ran toward him and threw herself against\r\nhim, breathing deeply in that position for several moments.\r\n\r\nBernard felt strongly the strength and zest of youth as he held the\r\ngirl in his arms. Then they turned and walked together to the outer\r\nwall, which was less than half a mile away. There was no danger from\r\nthe deactivated panthers, which would remain out of commission for half\r\nan hour. So they had no reason to hurry.\r\n\r\nBernard helped her climb the wall, though she seemed quite adept at it\r\nherself. On the other side they emerged upon the street. Across the\r\nstreet lay the acres and acres of homes which were the city\'s eastern\r\nsuburbia.\r\n\r\n"Oh, it was just horrible!" the girl finally cried. "All at once they\r\nsprang. 

From nowhere. I tripped and my sonic fell out of the holster.\r\nI\'d be _dead_ if it weren\'t for you!"\r\n\r\n"Very true," Bernard agreed. "You\'ll be more careful in the future, I\r\nhope."\r\n\r\n"If only I could thank you in some way. I owe you so much. My apartment\r\nis just up the next street. Only a few blocks. Wouldn\'t you like to\r\nstop in for a drink? I\'m sure you\'re as tired as I."\r\n\r\nBut Bernard declined. He walked her home, then continued on, unaware of\r\nthe envious glances of young children as he passed. Unaware of other\r\nrunners, early-runners, middle-aged men like himself, also walking the\r\nstreets, wearily but not stooping, not frowning.\r\n\r\nHow good a warm shower would be, thought Bernard, as he entered the\r\nlast mile. His wife would probably want a drink, so there would be that\r\ntoo. 

And dinner. He was _hungry_.\r\n\r\nUlcer-free and happy, he walked the last mile in contentment. The\r\noffice was something that had happened long ago, would happen again\r\ntomorrow, but could never invade his thoughts that night. And he knew\r\nexactly how his wife would greet him at the door.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Hello, darling. How was the run?" she asked, kissing him as he came\r\ninto the house. "You only made fair time this evening. 

Something\r\nhappen?

"\r\n\r\n"No, pretty routine. Panthers are on the increase. I came across\r\nthree of them attacking a girl runner. Works as a copy writer in the\r\ncity. She claims that the jungle cured her ulcers completely. Really\r\nremarkable.

"\r\n\r\n"Mmm-hmm," said Virginia, taking his holster. "Attractive, no doubt. I\r\nsuppose she tried to seduce you. I\'ve heard stories about those jungle\r\nwomen."\r\n\r\n"Nothing of the sort. Just suggested I drop in for a drink. 

After all,\r\nshe was grateful."\r\n\r\nWhat nonsense, he told himself as he showered, Virginia suggesting that\r\nthe girl had intended to seduce him. Oh, well, what difference did it\r\nmake?\r\n\r\nMan, that hot water felt good! Even on his scratched legs and arms.\r\n\r\nHow many years had he been making the run now? Twenty-three, almost. In\r\na way he could consider himself a sort of a pioneer. And to think that\r\nthe only reason he had started jungle running in the first place was to\r\nplease a supervisor! Those days everyone did it.\r\n\r\nAs he dried himself off, hearing the tinkle of cocktails in the living\r\nroom, he wondered if the panthers would move south, away from the water\r\nhole, before tomorrow\'s run.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


And the faint lines\r\naround his dark, deep-set eyes were accentuated when he smiled at his\r\nwife.\r\n\r\n"All set, honey. How do I look in my monkey suit?"\r\n\r\nHis wife was sitting stiffly on the flowered couch that was still not\r\ntheirs completely. In her fingers she held a cigarette burned down too\r\nfar. She said, "You look fine, Phil. You look just right." 

She managed a\r\nsmile. Then she leaned forward and crushed the cigarette in the ash\r\ntray on the maple coffee table and took another from the pack.\r\n\r\nHe came to her and touched his hands to her soft blond hair, raising her\r\nface until she was looking into his eyes. "You\'re the most beautiful\r\ngirl I know. Did I ever tell you that?

"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I think so. Yes, I\'m sure you did," she said, finishing the\r\nritual; but her voice broke, and she turned her head away. Phil sat\r\nbeside her and put his arm around her small shoulders. He had stopped\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\n"Honey, look at me," he said. "It isn\'t going to be bad. 

Honestly it\r\nisn\'t. We know exactly how it will be. If anything could go wrong, they\r\nwouldn\'t be sending me; you know that. I told you that we\'ve sent five\r\nun-manned ships up and everyone came back without a hitch."\r\n\r\nShe turned, facing him. There were tears starting in the corners of her\r\nwide, brown eyes, and she brushed them away with her hand.\r\n\r\n"Phil, don\'t go. Please don\'t. They can send Sammy. Sammy doesn\'t have a\r\nwife. Can\'t he go? They\'d understand, Phil. Please!" She was holding his\r\narms tightly with her hands, and the color had drained from her cheeks.\r\n\r\n"Mary, you know I can\'t back out now. How could I? 

It\'s been three\r\nyears. You know how much I\'ve wanted to be the first man to go. Nothing\r\nwould ever be right with me again if I didn\'t go. 

Please don\'t make it\r\nhard." He stopped talking and held her to him and stroked the back of\r\nher head. He could feel her shoulders shaking with quiet sobs. He\r\nreleased her and stood up.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got to get started, Mary. Will you come to the field with me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'ll come to say good-by." She paused and dropped her eyes. "Phil,\r\nif you go, I won\'t be here when you get back--if you get back. I won\'t\r\nbe here because I won\'t be the wife of a space pilot for the rest of my\r\nlife. It isn\'t the kind of life I bargained for. No matter how much I\r\nlove you, I just couldn\'t take that, Phil. I\'m sorry. 

I guess I\'m not\r\nthe noble sort of wife."\r\n\r\nShe finished and took another cigarette from the pack on the coffee\r\ntable and put it to her lips. Her hand was trembling as she touched the\r\nlighter to the end of the cigarette and drew deeply. Phil stood watching\r\nher, the excitement completely gone from his eyes.\r\n\r\n"I wish you had told me this a long time ago, Mary," Phil said. His\r\nvoice was dry and low. "I didn\'t know you felt this way about it."\r\n\r\n"Yes, you did. I told you how I felt. I told you I could never be the\r\nwife of a space pilot. But I don\'t think I ever really believed it was\r\npossible--not until this morning when you said tonight was the take-off.\r\nIt\'s so stupid to jeopardize everything we\'ve got for a ridiculous\r\ndream!"\r\n\r\nHe sat down on the edge of the couch and took her hands between his.\r\n"Mary, listen to me," he said. "It isn\'t a dream. It\'s real. There\'s\r\nnothing means anything more to me than you do--you know that. But no\r\nman ever had the chance to do what I\'m going to do tonight--no man ever.\r\nIf I backed out now for any reason, I\'d never be able to look at the sky\r\nagain. I\'d be through."\r\n\r\nShe looked at him without seeing him, and there was nothing at all in\r\nher eyes.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s go, if you\'re still going," she finally said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey drove through the streets of the small town with its small\r\nbungalows, each alike. There were no trees and very little grass. It was\r\na new town, a government built town, and it had no personality yet. It\r\nexisted only because of the huge ship standing poised in the take-off\r\nzone five miles away in the desert. Its future as a town rested with the\r\nship, and the town seemed to feel the uncertainty of its future, seemed\r\nready to stop existing as a town and to give itself back to the desert,\r\nif such was its destiny.\r\n\r\nPhil turned the car off the highway onto the rutted dirt road that led\r\nacross the sand to the field where the ship waited. In the distance they\r\ncould see the beams of the searchlights as they played across the\r\ntake-off zone and swept along the top of the high wire fence stretching\r\nout of sight to right and left. 

At the gate they were stopped by the\r\nguard. He read Phil\'s pass, shined his flashlight in their faces, and\r\nthen saluted. "Good luck, colonel," he said, and shook Phil\'s hand.\r\n\r\n"Thanks, sergeant. I\'ll be seeing you next week," Phil said, and smiled.\r\nThey drove between the rows of wooden buildings that lined the field,\r\nand he parked near the low barbed fence ringing the take-off zone. He\r\nturned off the ignition, and sat quietly for a moment before lighting a\r\ncigarette. Then he looked at his wife. She was staring through the\r\nwindshield at the rocket two hundred yards away. Its smooth polished\r\nsurface gleamed in the spotlight glare, and it sloped up and up until\r\nthe eye lost the tip against the stars.\r\n\r\n"She\'s beautiful, Mary. You\'ve never seen her before, have you?"\r\n\r\n"No, I\'ve never seen her before," she said. "Hadn\'t you better go?" Her\r\nvoice was strained and she held her hands closed tightly in her lap.\r\n"Please go now, Phil," she said.\r\n\r\nHe leaned toward her and touched her cheek. Then she was in his arms,\r\nher head buried against his shoulder.\r\n\r\n"Good-by, darling," she said.\r\n\r\n"Wish me luck, Mary?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes, good luck, Phil," she said. He opened the car door and got out.\r\nThe noise of men and machines scurrying around the ship broke the spell\r\nof the rocket waiting silently for flight.\r\n\r\n"Mary, I--" he began, and then turned and strode toward the\r\nadministration building without looking back.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nInside the building it was like a locker room before the big game. The\r\ntension stood alone, and each man had the same happy, excited look that\r\nPhil had worn earlier. 

When he came into the room, the noise and bustle\r\nstopped. They turned as one man toward him, and General Small came up to\r\nhim and took his hand.\r\n\r\n"Hello, Phil. We were beginning to think you weren\'t coming. You all\r\nset, son?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, I\'m all set, I guess," Phil said.\r\n\r\n"I\'d like you to meet the Secretary of Defense, Phil. He\'s over here by\r\nthe radar."\r\n\r\nAs they crossed the room, familiar faces smiled, and each man shook his\r\nhand or touched his arm. He saw Sammy, alone, by the coffee urn. Sammy\r\nwaved to him, but he didn\'t smile. Phil wanted to talk to him, to say\r\nsomething; but there was nothing to be said now. Sammy\'s turn would come\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Secretary," the general said, "this is Colonel Conover. He\'ll be\r\nthe first man in history to see the other side of the Moon. Colonel--the\r\nSecretary of Defense."\r\n\r\n"How do you do, sir. I\'m very proud to meet you," Phil said.\r\n\r\n"On the contrary, colonel. I\'m very proud to meet you. I\'ve been looking\r\nat that ship out there and wondering. I almost wish I were a young man\r\nagain. I\'d like to be going. It\'s a thrilling thought--man\'s first\r\nadventure into the universe. You\'re lighting a new dawn of history,\r\ncolonel. It\'s a privilege few men have ever had; and those who have had\r\nit didn\'t realize it at the time. Good luck, and God be with you."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, sir. I\'m aware of all you say. 

It frightens me a little."\r\n\r\nThe general took Phil\'s arm and they walked to the briefing room. There\r\nwere chairs set up for the scientists and Air Force officers directly\r\nconnected with the take-off. They were seated now in a semicircle in\r\nfront of a huge chart of the solar system. Phil took his seat, and the\r\nlast minute briefing began. It was a routine he knew by heart. He had\r\ngone over and over it a thousand times, and he only half listened now.\r\nHe kept thinking of Mary outside, alone by the fence.\r\n\r\nThe voice of the briefing officer was a dull hum in his ears.\r\n\r\n"... And orbit at 18,000-mph. You will then accelerate for the breakaway\r\nto 24,900-mph for five minutes and then free-coast for 116 hours\r\nuntil--"\r\n\r\nPhil asked a few questions about weather and solar conditions. And then\r\nthe session was done. They rose and looked at each other, the same\r\nunanswered questions on each man\'s face. There were forced smiles and\r\nhandshakes. They were ready now.\r\n\r\n"Phil," the general said, and took him aside.\r\n\r\n"Sir?"\r\n\r\n"Phil, you\'re ... you feel all right, don\'t you, son?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir. I feel fine. Why?"\r\n\r\n"Phil, I\'ve spent nearly every day with you for three years. I know you\r\nbetter than I know myself in many ways. 

And I\'ve studied the\r\npsychologist\'s reports on you carefully. Maybe it\'s just nervousness,\r\nPhil, but I think there\'s something wrong. Is there?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir. There\'s nothing wrong," Phil said, but his voice didn\'t carry\r\nconviction. He reached for a cigarette.\r\n\r\n"Phil, if there is anything--anything at all--you know what it might\r\nmean. You\'ve got to be in the best mental and physical condition of your\r\nlife tonight. You know better than any man here what that means to our\r\nsuccess. I think there is something more than just natural apprehension\r\nwrong with you. Want to tell me?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOutside, the take-off zone crawled with men and machines at the base of\r\nthe rocket. For ten hours, the final check-outs had been in progress;\r\nand now the men were checking again, on their own time. The thing they\r\nhad worked toward for six years was ready to happen, and each one felt\r\nthat he was sending just a little bit of himself into the sky. Beyond\r\nthe ring of lights and moving men, on the edge of the field, Mary stood.\r\nHer hands moved slowly over the top of the fence, twisting the barbs of\r\nwire. But her eyes were on the ship.\r\n\r\nAnd then they were ready. A small group of excited men came out from the\r\nadministration building and moved forward. The check-out crews climbed\r\ninto their machines and drove back outside the take-off zone. And,\r\nalone, one man climbed the steel ladder up the side of the\r\nrocket--ninety feet into the air. At the top he waved to the men on the\r\nground and then disappeared through a small port.\r\n\r\nMary waved to him. "Good-by," she said to herself, but the words stuck\r\ntight in her throat.\r\n\r\nThe small group at the base of the ship turned and walked back to the\r\nfence. And for an eternity the great ship stood alone, waiting. Then,\r\nfrom deep inside, a rumble came, increasing in volume to a gigantic roar\r\nthat shook the earth and tore at the ears. Slowly, the first manned\r\nrocket to the Moon lifted up and up to the sky.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor a long time after the rocket had become a tiny speck of light in the\r\nheavens, she stood holding her face in her hands and crying softly to\r\nherself. And then she felt the touch of a hand on her arm. She turned.\r\n\r\n"Phil! Oh, Phil." She held tightly to him and repeated his name over and\r\nover.\r\n\r\n"They wouldn\'t let me go, Mary," he said finally. "The general would not\r\nlet me go."\r\n\r\nShe looked at him. 

His face was drawn tight, and there were tears on his\r\ncheeks. "Thank, God," she said. "It doesn\'t matter, darling. The only\r\nthing that matters is you didn\'t go."\r\n\r\n"You\'re right, Mary," he said. His voice was low--so low she could\r\nhardly hear him. "It doesn\'t matter. Nothing matters now." 

He stood with\r\nhis hands at his sides, watching her. And then turned away and walked\r\ntoward the car.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n


"\r\n\r\n"Where\'d you get it?"\r\n\r\n"Mom gave it to me."\r\n\r\n"If you give it to me, I\'ll tell you what I\'m doing."\r\n\r\n"It\'s not worth it."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll let you be my assistant, too."\r\n\r\n"Still not worth it."\r\n\r\n"For ten cents?

"\r\n\r\n"Okay, ten cents."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShe counted out the money to her brother and put on an apron. "What\r\nshould I do now, Bob?"\r\n\r\n"Get the salt," Bob instructed.\r\n\r\nHe poured sardine oil from the can into the juicer, being very careful\r\nnot to let the sardines fall in. When he had squeezed the last drop of\r\noil out of the can, he ate all the sardines and tossed the can into the\r\nsink.\r\n\r\nBonnie went after the salt and, when she lifted out the box, she found\r\na package containing two chocolate graham crackers.\r\n\r\n"Mom has a new hiding place, Bob," she announced.\r\n\r\nBob looked up. "Where is it?

"\r\n\r\n"Behind the salt."\r\n\r\n"What did you find there?"\r\n\r\n"Two chocolate grahams."\r\n\r\nBobby held out his hand, accepted one of the crackers without thanks\r\nand proceeded to crumble the whole thing into his concoction, not even\r\nstopping to lick the chocolate off his hands.\r\n\r\nBonnie frowned in disbelief. She had never seen such self-sacrifice.\r\nThe act made her aware, for the first time, of the immense\r\nsignificance of the experiment.\r\n\r\nShe dropped her quarrel completely and walked over to the sink to get\r\na good look at what was being done. All she saw in the sink was a\r\nwadded, wet Corn Flake box, the empty sardine tin and spillings from\r\nthe juicer, which by this time was beginning to take on a distinctive\r\nand unpleasant odor. Bob gave Bonnie the job of adding seven pinches of\r\nsalt and some cocoa to the concoction.\r\n\r\n"What\'s it going to be, Bob?" she asked, blending the cocoa on her\r\nhands into her yellow corduroy skirt.\r\n\r\n"Stuff," Bob answered, unbending a little.\r\n\r\n"Government stuff?"\r\n\r\n"Nope."\r\n\r\n"Spaceship stuff?"\r\n\r\n"Nope."\r\n\r\n"Medicine?"\r\n\r\n"Nope.

"\r\n\r\n"I give up."\r\n\r\n"It\'s animal serum," Bob said, sliced his thumb on the sardine can,\r\nglanced unemotionally at the cut, ignored it.\r\n\r\n"What\'s animal serum, Bob?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s certain properties without which the universe in eternity regards\r\nfor human beings."\r\n\r\n"Oh," Bonnie said. 

She took off her apron and sat down at the other end\r\nof the kitchen. The smell from the juicer was beginning to reach her\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\nBobby combed the kitchen for something else to throw into his\r\nconcoction and came up with some oregano and liquid garlic.\r\n\r\n"I guess this is about it," he said.\r\n\r\nHe poured the garlic and oregano into his juicer, put the lid on, shook\r\nit furiously for a minute and then emptied the contents into a deep pot.\r\n\r\n"What are you doing now, Bob?" Bonnie asked.\r\n\r\n"You have to cook it for seven minutes."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBobby lit the stove, put a cover on the pot, set the timer for ten\r\nminutes and left the room. Bonnie tagged after him and the two of them\r\ngot involved in a rough game of basketball in the living room.\r\n\r\n"BING!" said the timer.\r\n\r\nBob dropped the basketball on Bonnie\'s head and ran back into the\r\nkitchen.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all done," he said, and took the cover off the pot. Only his\r\ndedication to his work kept him from showing the discomfort he felt\r\nwith the smell that the pot gave forth.\r\n\r\n"Fyew!" said Bonnie. 

"What do we do with it now? Throw it out?"\r\n\r\n"No, stupid. We have to stir it till it cools and then drink it."\r\n\r\n"Drink it?" Bonnie wrinkled her nose. "How come we have to drink it?"\r\n\r\nBobby said, "Because that\'s what you do with experiments, stupid."\r\n\r\n"But, Bob, it smells like garbage."\r\n\r\n"Medicine smells worse and it makes you healthy," Bob said, while\r\nstirring the pot with an old wooden spoon.\r\n\r\nBonnie held her nose, stood on tiptoe and looked in at the cooking\r\nsolution. "Will this make us healthy?"\r\n\r\n"Maybe." Bob kept stirring.\r\n\r\n"What will it do?"\r\n\r\n"You\'ll see." Bob took two clean dish towels, draped them around the\r\npot and carried it over to the formica kitchen table. In the process,\r\nhe managed to dip both towels in the mixture and burn his already\r\nsliced thumb. One plastic handle of the pot was still smoldering, from\r\nbeing too near the fire, but none of these things seemed to have the\r\nslightest effect on him. He put the pot down in the middle of the table\r\nand stared at it, chin in hand.\r\n\r\nBonnie plopped down opposite him, put her chin in her hands and asked,\r\n"We _have_ to drink that stuff?"\r\n\r\n"Yup."\r\n\r\n"Who has to drink it first?" Bob made no sign of having heard. 

"I\r\nthought so," said Bonnie. Still no comment. "What if it kills me?"\r\n\r\nBobby spoke by raising his whole head and keeping his jaw stationary\r\nin his hands. "How can it hurt you? There\'s nothing but pure food in\r\nthere."\r\n\r\nBonnie also sat and stared. "How much of that stuff do I have to drink?"\r\n\r\n"Just a little bit. Stick one finger in it and lick it off."\r\n\r\nBonnie pointed a cautious finger at the tarry-looking brew and slowly\r\nimmersed it, until it barely covered the nail. "Is that enough?"\r\n\r\n"Plenty," said Bob in a judicious tone.\r\n\r\nBonnie took her finger out of the pot and stared at it for a moment.\r\n"What if I get sick?"\r\n\r\n"You can\'t get sick. There\'s aspirin and vitamins in it, too."\r\n\r\nBonnie sighed and wrinkled her nose. 

"Well, here goes," she said. She\r\nlicked off a little bit.\r\n\r\nBob watched her with his television version of a scientific look. "How\r\ndo you feel?" he inquired.\r\n\r\nBonnie answered, "It\'s not so bad, once it goes down. You can taste the\r\nchocolate graham cracker." Bonnie was really enjoying the attention.\r\n"Hey," she said, "I\'m starting to get a funny feeling in my--" and,\r\nbefore she could finish the sentence, there was a loud _pop_.\r\n\r\nBob\'s face registered extreme disappointment.\r\n\r\nShe sat quite still for a moment and then said, "What happened?"\r\n\r\n"You\'ve turned into a chicken."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe little bird lifted its wings and looked down at itself. "How come\r\nI\'m a chicken, Bob?" it said, cocking its head to one side and staring\r\nat him with its left eye.\r\n\r\n"Ah, nuts," he explained. "I expected you to be more of a pigeon\r\nthing." Bob mulled over the ingredients of his stew to see what went\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\nThe chicken hopped around the chair on one leg, flapped its wings\r\nexperimentally and found itself on the kitchen table. It walked to the\r\nfar corner and peered into a small mirror that hung on the side of the\r\nsink cabinet.\r\n\r\n"I\'m a pretty ugly chicken, boy," it said.\r\n\r\nIt inspected itself with its other eye and, finding no improvement,\r\nwalked back to Bobby.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like to be a chicken, Bob," it said.\r\n\r\n"Why not? What does it feel like?

"\r\n\r\n"It feels skinny and I can\'t see so good."\r\n\r\n"How else does it feel?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s all how it feels. Make me stop being it."\r\n\r\n"First tell me better what it\'s like."\r\n\r\n"I told you already. Make me stop being it."\r\n\r\n"What are you afraid of? Why don\'t you see what it\'s like first, before\r\nyou change back? 

This is a valuable experience."\r\n\r\nThe chicken tried to put its hands on its hips, but could find neither\r\nhips nor hands. "You better change me back, boy," it said, and gave Bob\r\nthe left-eye glare.\r\n\r\n"Will you stop being stupid and just see what it\'s like first?" Bob was\r\nfinding it difficult to understand her lack of curiosity.\r\n\r\n"Wait till Mom sees what an ugly mess I am, boy. Will you ever get it!"\r\nBonnie was trying very hard to see Bob with both eyes at once, which\r\nwas impossible.\r\n\r\n"You\'re a sissy, Bonnie. You ruined the opportunity of a lifetime. 

I\'m\r\ndisgusted with you." Bob dipped his forefinger in the serum and held it\r\ntoward the chicken. It pecked what it could from the finger and tilted\r\nits head back.\r\n\r\nIn an instant, the chicken was gone and Bonnie was back. She climbed\r\ndown from the table, wiped her eyes and said, "It\'s a good thing you\r\nfixed me, boy. 

Would you ever have got it."\r\n\r\n"Ah, you\'re nothing but a sissy," Bob said, and licked off a whole\r\nfingerful of his formula. "If I change into a horse, I won\'t let you\r\nride me, and if I change into a leopard, I\'ll bite your head off." Once\r\nagain, the loud _pop_ was heard.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBonnie stood up, wide-eyed. "Oh, Bob," she said, "you\'re beautiful!"\r\n\r\n"What am I?" Bob asked.\r\n\r\n"You\'re a bee-yoo-tee-full St. Bernard, Bob! Let\'s go show Melissa and\r\nChuck."\r\n\r\n"A St. Bernard?" The animal looked disgusted. "I don\'t want to be no\r\ndog. I want to be a leopard."\r\n\r\n"But you\'re _beautiful_, Bob! 

Go look in the mirror."\r\n\r\n"Naah." The dog paddled over to the table.\r\n\r\n"What are you going to do, Bob?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m going to try it again."\r\n\r\nThe dog put its front paws on the table, knocked over the serum and\r\nlapped up some as it dripped on the floor. _Pop_ went the serum, taking\r\neffect. Bobby remained on all fours and kept on lapping. _Pop_ went the\r\nserum again.\r\n\r\n"What am I now?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"You\'re still a St. Bernard," said Bonnie.\r\n\r\n"The devil with it then," said the dog. "Let\'s forget all about it."\r\n\r\nThe dog took one last lap of serum. _Pop!_ Bobby got up from the floor\r\nand dejectedly started out the back door. Bonnie skipped after him.\r\n\r\n"What\'ll we do now, Bob?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll go down to Thrifty\'s and get some ice cream."\r\n\r\nThey walked down the hill silently, Bobby brooding over not having\r\nbeen a leopard and Bonnie wishing he had stayed a St. Bernard. As they\r\napproached the main street of the small town, Bonnie turned to her\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\n"You want to make some more of that stuff tomorrow?"\r\n\r\n"Not the same stuff," said Bob.\r\n\r\n"What\'ll we make instead?"\r\n\r\n"I ain\'t decided yet."\r\n\r\n"You want to make an atomic bomb?"\r\n\r\n"Maybe."\r\n\r\n"Can we do it in the juicer?"\r\n\r\n"Sure," Bob said, "only we\'ll have to get a couple of onions."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n

It was\r\nspherical, the estimated diameter about twenty-seven miles, and was in\r\nan orbit approximately 3400 miles from the surface of the Earth. No one\r\nobserved the escape from it.\r\n\r\nThe ship itself occasioned some excitement, but back there at the\r\ntattered end of the 20th century, what was one visiting spaceship more\r\nor less? Others had appeared before, and gone away discouraged--or just\r\nnot bothering. 

3-dimensional TV was coming out of the experimental\r\nstage. Soon anyone could have Dora the Doll or the Grandson of Tarzan\r\nsmack in his own living-room. Besides, it was a hot summer.\r\n\r\nThe first knowledge of the escape came when the region of Seattle\r\nsuffered an eclipse of the sun, which was not an eclipse but a near\r\nshadow, which was not a shadow but a thing. The darkness drifted out of\r\nthe northern Pacific. It generated thunder without lightning and without\r\nrain. 

When it had moved eastward and the hot sun reappeared, wind\r\nfollowed, a moderate gale. The coast was battered by sudden high waves,\r\nthen hushed in a bewilderment of fog.\r\n\r\nBefore that appearance, radar had gone crazy for an hour.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere buzzed with aircraft. They went up in readiness to shoot,\r\nbut after the first sighting reports only a few miles offshore, that\r\norder was vehemently canceled--someone in charge must have had a grain\r\nof sense. 

The thing was not a plane, rocket or missile. It was an\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nIf you shoot an animal that resembles an inflated gas-bag with wings,\r\nand the wingspread happens to be something over four miles tip to tip,\r\nand the carcass drops on a city--it\'s not nice for the city.\r\n\r\nThe Office of Continental Defense deplored the lack of precedent. But\r\nactually none was needed. You just don\'t drop four miles of dead or\r\ndying alien flesh on Seattle or any other part of a swarming homeland.\r\nYou wait till it flies out over the ocean, if it will--the most\r\ncommodious ocean in reach.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt, or rather she, didn\'t go back over the Pacific, perhaps because of\r\nthe prevailing westerlies. After the Seattle incident she climbed to a\r\ngreat altitude above the Rockies, apparently using an updraft with very\r\nlittle wing-motion. There was no means of calculating her weight, or\r\nmass, or buoyancy. Dead or injured, drift might have carried her\r\nanywhere within one or two hundred miles. Then she seemed to be\r\nfollowing the line of the Platte and the Missouri. By the end of the day\r\nshe was circling interminably over the huge complex of St. Louis,\r\nhopelessly crying.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nShe had a head, drawn back most of the time into the bloated mass of the\r\nbody but thrusting forward now and then on a short neck not more than\r\nthree hundred feet in length. When she did that the blunt turtle-like\r\nhead could be observed, the gaping, toothless, suffering mouth from\r\nwhich the thunder came, and the soft-shining purple eyes that searched\r\nthe ground but found nothing answering her need. The skin-color was\r\nmud-brown with some dull iridescence and many peculiar marks resembling\r\nweals or blisters. Along the belly some observers saw half a mile of\r\npaired protuberances that looked like teats.\r\n\r\nShe was unquestionably the equivalent of a vertebrate. Two web-footed\r\nlegs were drawn up close against the cigar-shaped body. The vast, rather\r\nnarrow, inflated wings could not have been held or moved in flight\r\nwithout a strong internal skeleton and musculature. Theorists later\r\nargued that she must have come from a planet with a high proportion of\r\nwater surface, a planet possibly larger than Earth though of about the\r\nsame mass and with a similar atmosphere. She could rise in Earth\'s air.\r\nAnd before each thunderous lament she was seen to breathe.\r\n\r\nIt was assumed that immense air sacs within her body were inflated or\r\npartly inflated when she left the ship, possibly with some gas lighter\r\nthan nitrogen. Since it was inconceivable that a vertebrate organism\r\ncould have survived entry into atmosphere from an orbit 3400 miles up,\r\nit was necessary to believe that the ship had briefly descended,\r\nunobserved and by unknown means, probably on Earth\'s night-side. Later\r\non the ship did descend as far as atmosphere, for a moment ...\r\n\r\nSt. Louis was partly evacuated. There is no reliable estimate of the\r\nloss of life and property from panic and accident on the jammed roads\r\nand rail lines. 1500 dead, 7400 injured is the conservative figure.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a night and a day she abandoned that area, flying heavily\r\neastward. The droning and swooping gnats of aircraft plainly distressed\r\nher. At first she had only tried to avoid them, but now and then during\r\nher eastward flight from St. Louis she made short desperate rushes\r\nagainst them, without skill or much sign of intelligence, screaming from\r\na wide-open mouth that could have swallowed a four-engine bomber. Two\r\naircraft were lost over Cincinnati, by collision with each other in\r\ntrying to get out of her way. Pilots were then ordered to keep a\r\ndistance of not less than ten miles until such time as she reached the\r\nAtlantic--if she did--when she could safely be shot down.\r\n\r\nShe studied Chicago for a day.\r\n\r\nBy that time Civil Defense was better prepared. About a million\r\nresidents had already fled to open country before she came, and the loss\r\nof life was proportionately smaller. 

She moved on. We have no clue to\r\nthe reason why great cities should have attracted her, though\r\napparently they did. She was hungry perhaps, or seeking help, or merely\r\ndrawn in animal curiosity by the endless motion of the cities and the\r\nstrangeness. It has even been suggested that the life forms of her\r\nhomeland--her masters--resembled humanity. She moved eastward, and\r\nreligious organizations united to pray that she would come down on one\r\nof the lakes where she could safely be destroyed. She didn\'t.\r\n\r\nShe approached Pittsburgh, choked and screamed and flew high, and soared\r\nin weary circles over Buffalo for a day and a night. Some pilots who had\r\nfollowed the flight from the West Coast claimed that the vast\r\nlamentation of her voice was growing fainter and hoarser while she was\r\ndrifting along the line of the Mohawk Valley. She turned south,\r\nfollowing the Hudson at no great height. Sometimes she appeared to be\r\nchoking, the labored inhalations harsh and prolonged, like a cloud in\r\nagony.\r\n\r\nWhen she was over Westchester, headquarters tripled the swarm of\r\ninterceptors and observation planes. Squadrons from Connecticut and\r\nsouthern New Jersey deployed to form a monstrous funnel, the small end\r\nbefore her, the large end pointing out to open sea. Heavy bombers closed\r\nin above, laying a smoke screen at 10,000 feet to discourage her from\r\nrising. The ground shook with the drone of jets, and with her crying.\r\n\r\nMultitudes had abandoned the metropolitan area. Other multitudes trusted\r\nto the subways, to the narrow street canyons and to the strength of\r\nconcrete and steel. Others climbed to a thousand high places and\r\nwatched, trusting the laws of chance.\r\n\r\nShe passed over Manhattan in the evening--between 8:14 and 8:27 P.M.,\r\nJuly 16, 1976--at an altitude of about 2000 feet. She swerved away from\r\nthe aircraft that blanketed Long Island and the Sound, swerved again as\r\nthe southern group buzzed her instead of giving way. She made no attempt\r\nto rise into the sun-crimsoned terror of drifting smoke.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plan was intelligent. It should have worked, but for one fighter\r\npilot who jumped the gun.\r\n\r\nHe said later that he himself couldn\'t understand what happened. It was\r\ncourt-martial testimony, but his reputation had been good. He was Bill\r\nGreen--William Hammond Green--of New London, Connecticut, flying a\r\none-man jet fighter, well aware of the strictest orders not to attack\r\nuntil the target had moved at least ten miles east of Sandy Hook. He\r\nsaid he certainly had no previous intention to violate orders. It was\r\nsomething that just happened in his mind. A sort of mental sneeze.\r\n\r\nHis squadron was approaching Rockaway, the flying creature about three\r\nmiles ahead of him and half a mile down. He was aware of saying out loud\r\nto nobody: "Well, she\'s too big." Then he was darting out of formation,\r\ndiving on her, giving her one rocket-burst and reeling off to the south\r\nat 840 MPH.\r\n\r\nHe never did locate or rejoin his squadron, but he made it somehow back\r\nto his home field. He climbed out of the cockpit, they say, and fell\r\nflat on his face.\r\n\r\nIt seems likely that his shot missed the animal\'s head and tore through\r\nsome part of her left wing. She spun to the left, rose perhaps a\r\nthousand feet, facing the city, sideslipped, recovered herself and\r\nfought for altitude. She could not gain it. In the effort she collided\r\nwith two of the following planes. One of them smashed into her right\r\nside behind the wing, the other flipped end over end across her back,\r\nlike a swatted dragonfly. It dropped clear and made a mess on Bedloe\'s\r\nIsland.\r\n\r\nShe too was falling, in a long slant, silent now but still living. After\r\nthe impact her body thrashed desolately on the wreckage between\r\nLexington and Seventh Avenues, her right wing churning, then only\r\ntrailing, in the East River, her left wing a crumpled slowly deflating\r\nmass concealing Times Square, Herald Square and the garment district.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the struggle her neck extended, her turtle beak grasping\r\nthe top of Radio City. She was still trying to pull herself up, as the\r\nbuoyant gasses hissed and bubbled away through the gushing holes in her\r\nside. Radio City collapsed with her.\r\n\r\nFor a long while after the roar of descending rubble and her own roaring\r\nhad ceased, there was no human noise except a melancholy thunder of the\r\nplanes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe apology came early next morning.\r\n\r\nThe spaceship was observed to descend to the outer limits of atmosphere,\r\nvery briefly. A capsule was released, with a parachute timed to open at\r\n40,000 feet and come down quite neatly in Scarsdale. Parachute, capsule\r\nand timing device were of good workmanship.\r\n\r\nThe communication engraved on a plaque of metal (which still defies\r\nanalysis) was a hasty job, the English slightly odd, with some evidence\r\nof an incomplete understanding of the situation. That the visitors were\r\nthemselves aware of these deficiencies is indicated by the text of the\r\nmessage itself.\r\n\r\n      Most sadly regret inexcusable escape of livestock. 

While\r\n      petting same, one of our children monkied (sp?) with airlock.\r\n      Will not happen again. Regret also imperfect grasp of\r\n      language, learned through what you term Television etc.\r\n      Animal not dangerous, but observe some accidental damage\r\n      caused, therefore hasten to enclose reimbursement, having\r\n      taken liberty of studying your highly ingenious methods of\r\n      exchange. Hope same will be adequate, having estimated\r\n      deplorable inconvenience to best of ability. 

Regret\r\n      exceedingly impossibility of communicating further, as\r\n      pressure of time and prior obligations forbids. Please accept\r\n      heartfelt apologies and assurances of continuing esteem.\r\n\r\nThe reimbursement was in fact properly enclosed with the plaque, and may\r\nbe seen by the public in the rotunda of the restoration of Radio City.\r\nThough technically counterfeit, it looks like perfectly good money,\r\nexcept that Mr. Lincoln is missing one of his wrinkles and the words\r\n"FIVE DOLLARS" are upside down.\r\n\r\n\r\n  --EDGAR PANGBORN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

The third pathway\r\nwas unmarked, and this was the one that inevitably the lovers and the\r\nhoneymooners took--the path that Alice and Fred Daniels followed today.\r\n\r\nThe sun was unusually warm for this time of year, but only a few\r\nyards along the pathway Fred and Alice were swallowed up by the great\r\nand near-great trees of the forest. The sunlight was, except for an\r\noccasional patch of light here and there, warded away by the foliage\r\nabove. The forest was very quiet. The pathway bridged a silent brook,\r\nand then, perhaps a third of a mile into the woods, turned abruptly to\r\nthe left and the woods became even more dense, the pathway narrow.\r\n\r\nThrough the trees to the right at this point was a clearing, an unusual\r\ngrassy circle perhaps sixty yards in diameter. It was not the clearing\r\nitself, however, but, instead, the glint of color in the sunlight that\r\ncaused Fred and Alice to stop and look.\r\n\r\nAlice said, "Fred, what is that?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t know," he said. "Something red. Let\'s look."\r\n\r\nThe two of them turned off the path and made their way through a\r\ndismal barrage of thicket to the clearing that lay beyond. When they\r\ngot there, they saw the circular object--_vehicle_ might be a better\r\nword. It was possibly fifteen yards in diameter. It seemed to be made\r\nof three rings, smaller ones bottom and top and the larger one ribbing\r\nthe center, and to be constructed of some kind of plastic. Between the\r\ncentral and upper rings were set a series of small windows. The entire\r\nthing was painted a gaudy red.\r\n\r\n"What do you think it is?" Fred said.\r\n\r\n"A flying saucer," Alice said promptly. She laughed a little, but\r\nclutched at her husband\'s arm. "Isn\'t it?

"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"But what else would it be?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," Fred said again. "Let\'s look inside."\r\n\r\n"Fred," Alice said, "You\'d better not--"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be silly," he said, and walked resolutely up to the object and,\r\nstanding on tiptoe, peered through one of the windows.\r\n\r\n"What is it?" Alice called from the edge of the clearing. "What do you\r\nsee?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s empty," he called back.\r\n\r\n"What\'s inside?"\r\n\r\nFred shook his head. "You won\'t believe it."\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s got a steering wheel," he called out hollowly. "And some dials."\r\n\r\n"My goodness," Alice said. "Is it a real one?"\r\n\r\n"How do I know?" he said, and rejoined her, casting a series of glances\r\nuncertainly over his shoulder at the bright red saucer behind him.\r\n"What do you suppose we ought to do?"\r\n\r\n"Tell somebody," Alice said. "I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Who do we tell?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. There must be _somebody_--"\r\n\r\nThey looked almost guiltily at each other. "Nobody\'ll believe us," Fred\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"Why not?" Alice said. "It\'s _here_, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\nFred stopped and thought. "Who knows how long it\'ll stay?"\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other again. Then Alice said slowly, "If we went\r\nback and got the camera--"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSwiftly, they made their way back toward the hotel through the quiet\r\nforest. When they got there, they found Mr. Mason, the manager of the\r\nhotel, adjusting the badminton net in front of the main porch. Mr.\r\nMason loosed a ready smile. "How\'s everything?" 

he said. "Find enough\r\nto do?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, thank you," Fred said to him. "We were just walking through the\r\nwoods. We came back for our camera. Then we\'re off again."\r\n\r\nMr. Mason nodded. "Find the saucer?"\r\n\r\nFred looked at him. "You mean the flying saucer?"\r\n\r\nThe manager nodded again. "I see you did find it. 

Good. Take a picture\r\nof it, by all means. I\'ve already taken a whole batch myself."\r\n\r\n"You have?" Fred said, frowning. "What\'s it all about?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s a flying saucer," Mr. Mason said. "From Venus. Mr. Steariot, who\r\npiloted it, is a guest here. I can introduce you to him if you like. 

He\r\nspeaks excellent English."\r\n\r\nFred Daniels said, "Wait a minute. You--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, there\'s no point in it," Mr. Mason said in a weary tone of voice.\r\n"No point in it at all. I took pictures. I tried to get the Army up\r\nhere. I wrote letters." He shrugged expressively. "It\'s a cynical age\r\nwe live in, I guess. Everybody\'s very polite, but they make it clear\r\nthey think it\'s just a gimmick I worked up to get the hotel publicity."\r\nHe nodded seriously. 

"The whole trouble\'s with Mr. Steariot. If he had\r\na light bulb for a head, or seven legs, or talked funny, why, it\'d be\r\na different thing entirely. But he looks and acts just like you or I.\r\nHere I\'ve got a legitimate flying saucer sitting on my property and you\r\nmight as well try to tell them it\'s a--well, a flying saucer! For all\r\nthey\'ll believe me. 

Now you two have seen it with your own eyes and you\r\ndon\'t believe it either."\r\n\r\nFred swallowed and looked at Alice for a moment. Then he said, "What\r\ndid you say his name was?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Steariot," Mr. 

Mason said. "Actually, he\'s just as happy nobody\r\nbelieves he\'s from Venus. If they believed it, they\'d probably lock him\r\nup in jail somewhere or impound his saucer. As it is, he says this is\r\nthe first vacation he\'s had in years." Mr. Mason looked unhappily about\r\nhim. "He\'s probably in the lounge now. Want to meet him?"\r\n\r\nFred said dazedly, "I--"\r\n\r\n"Ah, come on," Mr. Mason said. "He won\'t bite you." He led the way up\r\nthe steps of the porch and into the lounge and over to where a small,\r\nmustachioed man, wearing eyeglasses and appearing to be in his late\r\nforties, was working a crossword puzzle in the morning paper.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Steariot," Mr. 

Mason said, "I should like you to meet Mr. and Mrs.\r\nDaniels, also guests here. They have just seen your saucer."\r\n\r\n"Charmed," Mr. Steariot said, and got to his feet. He shook hands with\r\nFred Daniels. "Are you here for a long stay, Mr. Daniels?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not sure," Fred said, a little unhappily. "Mr. Mason told us you\r\nwere from Venus."\r\n\r\n"I told them about you, Mr. Steariot," Mr. Mason said. "Naturally, they\r\ndon\'t believe it any more than anybody else."\r\n\r\n"No reason why they should," Mr. Steariot said amiably. "No reason in\r\nthe world, if I may coin a phrase. Dr. Phelps at the Institute didn\'t\r\nbelieve it either."\r\n\r\nMr. Mason said, "Mr. Steariot here had a long interview with Dr. Phelps\r\nof the Geophysical Institute at Princeton when he first arrived here on\r\nEarth with us."\r\n\r\n"Oh," Fred said. He gazed uncomfortably at Mr. Steariot. "We didn\'t\r\nmean to interrupt you."\r\n\r\n"I was only doing the crossword puzzle," Mr. 

Steariot said. "Do you\r\nknow a two-letter word for sun-god?"\r\n\r\nAlice said, "Is this your first trip here?"\r\n\r\n"You mean here to the hotel," Mr. Steariot said, "or to Earth?"\r\n\r\n"Earth," Fred said, dismally.\r\n\r\n"My second," Mr. Steariot said. "First trip I wound up near Leningrad.\r\nTerrible time. I thought they\'d talk English, but they don\'t, and they\r\nthought I was an American, and two of their officials got into the\r\nsaucer with me, and the only way I could save myself was to take off\r\nwith them. They\'re on Venus now."\r\n\r\n"This accounts," Mr. Mason broke in, "for the way those two high\r\nRussian officials suddenly disappeared from sight three years ago. You\r\nremember? Everybody thought they\'d been liquidated."\r\n\r\nFred Daniels looked around the room. A hollow, frightening feeling had\r\ncome upon him. There were hundreds of questions he could have asked,\r\nand yet he wanted nothing so much as to be away from there.\r\n\r\nHis wife Alice, though, was constrained to learn more about Mr.\r\nSteariot. She said, "Mr. Steariot, may I ask you something?"\r\n\r\n"By all means," Mr. Steariot said, and blinked owlishly at her.\r\n\r\n"Do you," Alice said to him, "carry any money?"\r\n\r\nIt was, Fred Daniels realized, a marvelous question. If there were sham\r\nhere, this would be the quickest way to--\r\n\r\n"Why, of course." 

Mr. Steariot said, and reached for his wallet.\r\n"Let\'s see--health insurance--saucer driver\'s license--here, my dear.\r\nA five-djino bill." He extracted a yellow banknote and handed it to\r\nAlice. The banknote, slightly larger than an American dollar bill, was\r\nremarkably similar in other particulars. It had upon it a picture of a\r\nflying saucer, the figure 5, and, spelled out, "FIVE DJINOS".\r\n\r\n"Let me sign it for you," Mr. Steariot said, taking out a pen. "You can\r\nhave it for a souvenier."\r\n\r\n"Like the short snorters in the war," Mr. Mason, the hotel manager,\r\nsaid. "You remember them, Mr. 

Daniels? Where people got famous\r\nsignatures on five and ten and twenty-dollar bills and exchanged them\r\nand what not, and they called them short snorters?"\r\n\r\n"I remember," Fred Daniels said. 

"Something like that."\r\n\r\n"Five djinos on Venus," Mr. Steariot said, signing his name with a\r\nflourish, "is worth about twenty dollars here on Earth. No official\r\nrate of exchange, of course, but from what I\'ve seen, that\'s about what\r\nI\'d judge. 

Here you go." He handed the bill over.\r\n\r\n"Well, wait, then," Fred Daniels said. "I ought to sign one of _our_\r\nbills for _you_."\r\n\r\n"Ah, no need for that," Mr. 

Steariot said. "No doubt you need twenty\r\ndollars worse than I need five djinos."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be ridiculous," Fred said, a little stiffly; and, by now\r\ncommitted, he went into his wallet and came out with a twenty dollar\r\nbill. He signed his name to it, using Mr. Steariot\'s fountain pen.\r\n\r\n"Wonderful," Mr. Steariot said. "How nice to have met you both."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"I feel very badly about this," Mr. Mason, the hotel manager, said to\r\nFred and Alice. The three of them were on the porch outside. "This\r\nshort snorter business always seems to happen whenever I introduce Mr.\r\nSteariot to anyone. Dr. Phelps at the Institute gave him fifty dollars.\r\nCan you imagine that?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s interesting in its way," Fred said. "It just occurred to me: Mr.\r\nSteariot can spend Earth money here, but we can\'t spend Venus money."\r\n\r\n"That\'s true," Mr. Mason said. 

"On the other hand, Mr. Steariot has\r\nnever once, to my knowledge, been the one to bring up the subject. I\r\nthink it\'s quite painful to him, really. But the same thing inevitably\r\noccurs to everybody he meets. You know, let\'s see the color of your\r\nmoney. I guess people are pretty much the same everywhere--that\r\nis, everywhere on _Earth_. They judge everything in terms of money,\r\nincluding whether you\'ve even been born on Earth! \'Let\'s see your\r\nmoney,\' they say to Mr. Steariot, and out he comes with one of those\r\ndamn five-djino bills, and we\'re off."\r\n\r\n"You know," Alice Daniels said thoughtfully, "in a way it\'s a lesson.\r\nIsn\'t it, Fred? I mean, everybody is money conscious. Maybe too much\r\nso. I\'m not sorry it cost us twenty dollars to meet Mr. Steariot."\r\n\r\n"You may be right," Fred said to her. "You may be right. Who knows,\r\nsome day this five-djino bill may be a very valuable--"\r\n\r\n"There you go again," Alice cut in. "Always putting it in terms of\r\nmoney."\r\n\r\n"But _you\'re_ the one," Fred said, "who thought to ask him about it in\r\nthe first place."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t quarrel," Mr. Mason, the hotel manager, said to them. "After\r\nall, for you it\'s just a vacation. For me, I\'ve got this man sitting in\r\nmy lounge day in and day out doing crossword puzzles and trading short\r\nsnorters with my guests. Nobody really believes he\'s from Venus--nobody\r\nimportant, anyway. It\'s a little frightening, when you\'re trying to run\r\na happy hotel. Sometimes I wish he\'d go back to wherever he came from."\r\n\r\n"Well," Fred said, "he\'s bound to leave one of these days."\r\n\r\n"Maybe," Mr. Mason said doubtfully. "Offhand, though, I\'d say the way\r\nhe\'s taking it in, he can\'t afford to."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


No, he wasn't the Agent just before you. He was here in\r\n2180--oh, a good thirty years back, Earth-time. The natives say\r\nhundreds of years, but they're a short-lived lot. The way they cut\r\neach other's throats, it's a wonder any of them live out the life span\r\nthey've got, anyway.\r\n\r\nI came out when Duncan did--knew him pretty well, as well as anybody\r\ncould. A perfect fool. Knowing him was a real education. Do anything\r\nthe other way from the way Duncan did it, and you'd be all right.\r\n\r\nYou wouldn't think it to look at him. Well set-up man, around thirty\r\nwhen he got here, intelligent face, good talker, had a degree--but\r\na fool. 

Seemed as if he couldn't do anything right. He told me once\r\nthat he'd been married, and that it had broken up. He more or less\r\nimplied that his wife had gotten sick of little things--broken dishes,\r\ntactless remarks, carelessness. You wouldn't think that would be\r\nenough to break up a marriage, but you've got no idea how that sort of\r\nthing can add up.\r\n\r\nI was clerking for him then. I swear I did all the work. 

I had to. He\r\ncouldn't add, couldn't file a record, and couldn't have found one if\r\nhe'd managed somehow to put it away. I took Agent's inventories, I did\r\nmost of the trading with the native chiefs, I did everything. Duncan\r\njust bumbled around the post, or listened to records, or wrote those\r\nsilly, hopeless, letters to his ex-wife. He was trying to get her to\r\ncome back to him. 

How do I know? Well, who do you think worked the\r\nsubspace transmitter, as well as doing everything else?\r\n\r\nThe native thing really annoyed me, though, because it was dangerous.\r\nYou know the Tarchiki. They look human enough, except for minor\r\ndetails. When it comes to a Tarchik female I'll overlook the green skin\r\nand the pointed ears every time. But they aren't entirely like us. 

They\r\nhave a liking for war and torture that's really sickening.\r\n\r\nOur ancestors? Oh, now, really ... you're talking just like Duncan.\r\nThat was always his apology for them. He said our own ancestors were\r\npretty bad, too. Certainly they were, but I can't see any ancestor of\r\nmine acting the way a Tarchik does with a captured enemy. And they\r\nhaven't the slightest sense of sportsmanship, either. They'd rather\r\njump you from ambush than fight in the open, and they won't fight at\r\nall if the enemy's stronger than they are. That's why they've never\r\nmade any serious attempt to do in all the Earthmen on their world.\r\nThat, and greed; they get very good deals from us, and they know it.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm sure none of my ancestors ever acted like that.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut Duncan was always ready to forgive a Tarchik anything. That used\r\nto upset the hell out of them, too, because they expect to be punished\r\nwhen they're caught at anything. They don't understand our reluctance\r\nto kill, but they respect a Patrolman's shock gun, and when they get\r\ncaught stealing or taking each other's tails they know they're going\r\nto get a few months in quod, or what they hate much worse, a public\r\nflogging. If they didn't get punished, they'd assume it was weakness on\r\nour part. Just like kids.\r\n\r\nAnyway, there was Duncan, holding long confabs with the Tarchiki,\r\ntrying to teach them some sort of elementary ethics. Naturally, it\r\ndidn't take at all. They listened, because they love long speeches, but\r\nthey never acted on what he said.\r\n\r\nHe used to tell them that if they stopped chopping each other up and\r\nhanging up the rows of tails as war trophies, their lives would be a\r\nlot pleasanter. They used to nod and applaud, but Duncan never caught\r\non to the simple fact that they thought this was meant to be a joke.\r\n_They_ didn't think their lives weren't pleasant enough. After all,\r\nlook at their situation. They've got plenty to eat, without working\r\nhard for it, plenty of time on their hands--why shouldn't they keep\r\ndown their surplus population? They don't know any other way, except\r\nbreaking up their eggs, and they only do that to enemy tribes.\r\n\r\nWhile he was at it, Duncan tried to tell them all about love and things\r\nlike that. Oh, no, not sex. If there's anything a Tarchik doesn't\r\nknow about _that_, there's no Earthman going to teach him. I mean the\r\nway they treat their women. A Tarchik woman's nothing but a piece of\r\nproperty as far as sex goes, but there's some kind of curious maternal\r\ninheritance thing--anyway, it's as funny as hell to see a big Tarchik\r\nbuck get down and bump his head in front of his mother, and his aunts,\r\nand all his other female ancestors. That's the one thing he's really\r\nafraid of. But, till she gets to be a mother, a woman leads a fairly\r\nrough life, getting passed around as a kind of prize of war, working\r\nharder than the men, all that.\r\n\r\nSo Duncan wanted them to be a bit chivalrous to their women. Share the\r\nwork, all kinds of things like that. You know what they thought of that\r\nidea--another Earthman's joke.\r\n\r\nBut the funniest thing of all, to them, was his idea about the kids.\r\nNaturally, a Tarchik pup's no use to its father till it's a bit grown.\r\nThen, if it's a boy, the old man teaches it to drink _smassi_ and file\r\nits teeth, and go out ambushing and cutting tails with the other noble\r\nsavages. If it's a girl, the father looks around for a suitable buyer\r\nas soon as its breasts are grown, and hopes for the best price possible.\r\n\r\nTo the mothers, though, the kids represent a kind of investment, since\r\ncustom directs the first loyalties to the mother's clan. So they treat\r\nthem pretty well, although a bit casually, since they litter by twos\r\nand at least once a year.\r\n\r\nAnyway, Duncan seemed to think highly of kids. Can't imagine why, since\r\nhe never had any of his own. 

He used to run a kind of school for them.\r\nTaught them all kinds of things a Tarchik's got no use for at all, made\r\ntoys for them--badly, naturally; he couldn't have cut his initials in\r\na tree without slicing his thumb. But what he couldn't make in the way\r\nof school stuff, he imported from Earth. Cost him his entire salary,\r\nexcept for what he spent on those futile letters to his wife.\r\n\r\nThose kids were fond of him, I suppose--as fond of him as a Tarchik\r\never gets of anything. They even kept the school foolishness going\r\nawhile afterward, but I think it's gone now.\r\n\r\nAnything that fool Duncan said, the Tarchiki thought was a great joke.\r\nThey wouldn't have hurt his feelings for anything, for fear he'd quit\r\ntelling them tall stories. They told him quite a few things, too. 

He\r\nwrote it all down, in dead earnest, as if their fairy tales and drum\r\npoems had any value. I sent the whole lot off to his wife, after it\r\nhappened. I think it got lost in transit--I never heard from her,\r\nanyway. 

Or she may have thrown it all away. I can't imagine what else\r\nyou could do with such a pile of nonsense.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, that's what led up to it--those damned legends.\r\nDuncan got interested in their religion. Never do that, boy. Let 'em\r\nall have their ghost stories and wooden gods, and never fool around\r\nwith their idea of what makes the planet go round.\r\n\r\nThe Tarchiks have a lot of small time fetishes, but they also have\r\none big god, a fat one made out of stone, out in the jungle over near\r\nMount Clarke. Every so often they all go up in a body and pay him a\r\nvisit, and they take along any spare pups, usually extra girl children\r\nor prisoners from other tribes. This god--Kachan, his name is, I\r\nthink--likes children too. He likes them best roasted, like birds on a\r\nspit. Charming deity.\r\n\r\nAnyway, when Duncan found out about Kachan, he got very upset. He went\r\nblazing out there to Mount Clarke, and he blew Kachan all to bits with\r\na grenade. The Tarchiki didn't care for that, naturally.\r\n\r\nAbout a week later, Duncan was on his way over to the big village near\r\nhere, to give his Tarchik kids another arithmetic lesson, I suppose.\r\nOld Stancha--he was the local religious big shot, a kind of High\r\nPriest--threw a spear from the bushes, Tarchik fashion, and nailed\r\nDuncan very neatly. Nailed, yes. That's the way we found him, with his\r\nback against a tree.\r\n\r\nJust another case of a man's foolishness catching up with him. But\r\nDuncan hasn't stopped giving us trouble yet, dead or not. First thing\r\nthat happened was that old Stancha came in to the post, demanding to\r\nbe executed. He claimed he'd made a big mistake killing Duncan, the\r\nbiggest mistake of his life. I never could figure out what he meant--it\r\nseemed to have something to do with what Duncan said to him just before\r\nhe died.\r\n\r\nWell, if Stancha had kept his mouth shut, we'd have had no case at\r\nall, which would have been just fine with me. I was Agent, in Duncan's\r\nplace, and I was out to see to it that business stayed good and got\r\nbetter. Can't annoy the natives by executing their high priest and\r\nexpect good trade. But I couldn't very well let Stancha go, either,\r\nonce he'd confessed. So I had him tried, all proper and correct, and\r\nexecuted him in due form.\r\n\r\nNext thing I knew, the Tarchiks were putting Kachan back together\r\nagain. They were all up there, building a great big new version, and\r\nhaving a first class party at the same time. 

These parties generally\r\nlead to a tail-hunting expedition, so I expected some trouble. But it\r\ndidn't, this time.\r\n\r\nThere was plenty of noise, though. The Tarchiki never do anything\r\nquietly, and this seemed to be an occasion. What with drums, bagpipes,\r\nwailing and howling, there wasn't a bird would roost for twenty miles\r\naround.\r\n\r\nWhen they got all through, I went up to look over the new statue, out\r\nof curiosity, and because I'd heard that they hadn't sacrificed a\r\nsingle pup. I thought there must be something queer about Kachan Number\r\nTwo. There was.\r\n\r\nIt was Duncan. They'd given him a tail, and he looked more like a\r\nTarchik than an Earthman, but the face was unmistakable. They aren't\r\nhalf bad carvers, you know; and they'd really spread themselves this\r\ntime. The thing was forty feet tall, and it stood on a rock platform,\r\nwith some words carved in that lettering Duncan had taught them to use.\r\nThe words were something Duncan was supposed to have said as he was\r\ndying.\r\n\r\nI never could read that stuff really well; all I got out of the thing\r\nwas that Duncan was forgiving the old murderer, because he didn't know\r\nwhat he was doing. Pure nonsense, of course, but you don't expect a\r\ndying man to make sense, and particularly not Duncan. But it seems\r\nthose words were what had caused all the to-do.\r\n\r\nI found the story in one of those ballads Duncan had collected. Seems\r\nthat the Tarchiki had been expecting a great teacher to show up,\r\nwho'd do all sorts of wonderful things for them. Nothing unusual; all\r\nprimitives have some story like that. But there was something else.\r\n\r\nThe idea was that if the Tarchiki listened to this teacher, he'd make\r\nthem the most important people in the whole world; in the universe,\r\nin fact, from the way the thing sounded. Just how, wasn't specified.\r\nBut if they should let him be killed, they would know who he had been\r\nbecause of his last words, forgiving them. Naturally, they fitted\r\nDuncan right in; forgiving anybody would be the least likely idea in\r\nany Tarchik's mind if he were being speared.\r\n\r\nSo the Tarchiki think they've made a terrible mistake, and they seem\r\nbent on spending the rest of time making up for it. It's the leading\r\nreligion now, and it's the biggest joke I've ever come across. 

Poor\r\nDuncan, wrong-headed as he was about nearly everything else, had a bit\r\nof sense in that department; he never had any religious nonsense in him.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it shows you, doesn't it? I've always said you can learn a\r\nlittle from practically anything. You keep Duncan in mind, any time you\r\nget to feeling too soft on these natives. He might be a god to these\r\nTarchiki, but I'll tell you the real test of whether a man's got any\r\nsense; he's dead, I'm alive, and you're alive. That's enough proof for\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n

]\r\n\r\n\r\nN\'Zik was a forlorn and weary figure at the forward port. He balanced\r\nhis frail, bulbous body on four of his eight limbs, while the other\r\nfour moved listlessly over the etheroscope, adjusting sights and\r\nlenses. N\'Zik wondered dully why he bothered. Even from here he could\r\nsee that the system looking ahead, the dull reddish Sun with its wild\r\nand darksome planets, was not for them.\r\n\r\nBitterness flooded his soul. To have come so far and searched so\r\nlong, only to find this! In all this Galaxy here was the one Sun that\r\nsustained a planetary system, and that Sun was dying! The irony was\r\nmore than he could bear.\r\n\r\nShi-Zik came to stand beside him. Only she and N\'Zik were left, of all\r\nthe thousands; two alone on this driving colossus which was the only\r\nworld they had ever known. She sensed his bitterness now and tried to\r\nspeak words of hope.\r\n\r\n"See, N\'Zik, there are inner planets! How close their orbits are! There\r\nmay still be warmth and life-sustaining rays."\r\n\r\nN\'Zik\'s limbs sprawled outward in despair.\r\n\r\n"This dying system is not for us, Shi-Zik. The five largest and\r\noutermost planets are but barren, frigid rock. But if you wish, we\r\nshall go inward."\r\n\r\nHis limbs flashed over the huge control-console. Gradually the ship\r\nslowed in its headlong pace. Nearly the size of a small planet, was\r\nthis ship; entire generations had been born and died aboard it, during\r\nthe trip between Galaxies. Somewhere deep inside, perpetual generators\r\npounded out the power that had driven them through space faster than\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nN\'Zik and Shi-Zik had never seen those generators, nor were they\r\nconscious now of the smooth threnody. They had known it always. Miles\r\nof inter-locking corridors extended behind them too, a veritable city\r\nwith vast rooms of wonderful machinery--but none of this had they ever\r\nseen. For DEATH had struck suddenly there, was lurking there still.\r\n\r\nThe huge metal tomes told of it. N\'Zik and Shi-Zik had read that\r\nhistory so often that they knew it now by heart. They knew how and why\r\nthe last generations had been wiped out.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first scientists had planned well for the safety and well-being\r\nof the generations to come, but they had overlooked one thing. Within\r\ntheir own Galaxy they had been cognizant of certain cosmic rays, which\r\nwere harmless insofar as they had no apparent effect on living tissues.\r\nHowever, in that utter vacuity between Galaxies _no such rays existed_!\r\nAnd there between Galaxies new generations were born. Five, ten, a\r\ndozen generations. And at last--they had reached the new Galaxy....\r\n\r\nWhether the cosmic rays here differed, or whether the new generations\r\nhad simply lost all resistance to them, was never fully known. The\r\nrace had died by thousands as the hard rays penetrated the ship. The\r\nscientists worked feverishly to build up a section with layers of\r\ntheir heaviest metals; but by the time they had achieved a sufficient\r\nthickness, a few dozen had survived.\r\n\r\nN\'Zik and Shi-Zik were the last of that final group.\r\n\r\nNow, under N\'Zik\'s sure guidance, the ship crossed the orbits of the\r\nouter planets. He had thrown over the deceleration control, but their\r\nspeed was still tremendous.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes craggy fragments of rock were skimming past their\r\nhull. The larger ones were deflected by automatic repulsion plates and\r\nthe few that drifted through became molten upon contact. Such was their\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\nThen they were through the swarm, and N\'Zik remarked, "This is an old\r\nsystem indeed. At one time a planet must have occupied that orbit."\r\n\r\n"Look." Shi-Zik\'s spider-like body was taut with eagerness as she\r\npointed to a planet far ahead, swinging away from their trajectory.\r\n"Shall we follow it?"\r\n\r\n"There is no purpose. 

We can pick it up in the etheroscope." 

N\'Zik\r\nadjusted the sights. The planet together with its two moons leaped into\r\nview on the screen. N\'Zik manipulated the magnilens and it was brought\r\nstill nearer.\r\n\r\nVast icy caps encompassed most of this world. The rest was frozen\r\ndesert, slightly reddish, with a few peculiar straight-line markings\r\nthat might have been man-made. But that didn\'t interest them now.\r\nIt was all too apparent that this planet had been uninhabitable for\r\nmillennia.\r\n\r\n"Dead. A frozen, dead world," Shi-Zik intoned. "Let us go on to the\r\nnext one."\r\n\r\nThey moved ever inward. The next planet with its single satellite\r\noffered no more promise. Here they saw stark mountain ranges in\r\ncontrast to vast hollows that might have been dead ocean bottoms. The\r\nmagnilens picked out several cities, tottering, crumbling in ruin.\r\n\r\n"Cities," N\'Zik muttered. "Cities still standing on this airless world.\r\nA civilization once existed here, and it cannot have been so long ago.\r\nShall we go on, Shi-Zik? There are two or three other planets but I\r\nfear they will offer no more than this."\r\n\r\nNow something of N\'Zik\'s despair came upon Shi-Zik. "No, we need not\r\ngo on. I feel weary of it all. I care not if we ever find the place we\r\nseek."\r\n\r\n"I too, have had this feeling," N\'Zik waved his limbs in agreement.\r\n"Shi-Zik, we have searched this Galaxy through. There may yet be\r\nlife-giving Suns with planets, but we have not much time. Of late I\r\nhave felt the engines becoming sluggish of power...."\r\n\r\n"True. The way has been long." 

She gestured hopelessly. "Do you suggest\r\nthen, that we put an end to the mission?"\r\n\r\n"Not without your consent, Shi-Zik."\r\n\r\n"I have wanted to end it!" Shi-Zik cried. "For a very long time I have\r\nthought of it, but dared not speak."\r\n\r\n"And yet," N\'Zik mused, "perhaps we should search further. Search until\r\nthe end. It was the will of our forebears that the race be continued.\r\nShould we end so ingloriously what they set out to achieve?"\r\n\r\n"The will of our forebears is as nothing to the will of Praav," Shi-Zik\r\nspoke softly, gazing out to the stars. "Praav has watched safely over\r\nus all this time. If He had wanted us to find a place, we should have\r\nfound it. 

And we need not end ingloriously. Observe, N\'Zik, that we,\r\nthe last of our kind, have ended here, at what is probably the last\r\nplanetary system. Its sun is dying as our race is dying. Let us all go\r\nout in a final flame together, a blaze of glory!"\r\n\r\nThe bitterness had left N\'Zik now. "You are right, my dear. It was\r\nmeant that we should end here. I believe Praav has willed it so!"\r\n\r\nHe threw the controls over to full acceleration and locked them\r\ninto place. The colossus of all spaceships piled acceleration upon\r\nacceleration with the speed of light, plunging on its unerring course\r\ntoward the dying Sun. The two beings from another Galaxy stood at the\r\nforward port, proudly side by side. N\'Zik looked at Shi-Zik and felt\r\nsuch a peace as he had never known.\r\n\r\nAnd Shi-Zik murmured, "Praav, in his inscrutable wisdom...."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCurt Sanders climbed wearily up the last steep passage from the city\r\nbelow. Space-suited and helmeted, he emerged from the low line of\r\ncliffs and looked out upon the desolate surface of Mercury.\r\n\r\nFor the past week he had worked hard in the underground laboratories.\r\nOccasionally he came to the surface where he could see the dark sky,\r\nand the pin-points of stars, and the dying Sun once more. That alone\r\ngave him incentive to go on. 

He, with the several thousand others,\r\nwere working out the problem which might save them from extinction. It\r\nwas slow work, damnably slow and hard, and Curt knew in his heart they\r\nwould not be in time.\r\n\r\nHe raised his face to the red orb whose heat scarcely touched\r\nhere. Again he marvelled that disaster had come so suddenly. Solar\r\nradiation was not supposed to end like that! It should have gone on\r\nfor millennia. That\'s what the scientists had preached. But it had\r\nended--scarcely five hundred years ago. Curt had never known Earth,\r\nonly the city here far within Mercury, where there was meager warmth\r\nand light. And now even the internal heat of Mercury was fast cooling.\r\n\r\nCurt turned at the sound of footsteps behind him. That would be Olana.\r\nShe, too, came here each week.\r\n\r\nShe stopped beside him, raised her helmeted face to Sun and stars\r\nwith infinite longing. For a moment neither of them spoke. Then Olana\r\nclicked on her helmet radio.\r\n\r\n"Each time, Curt ... each time I come here I imagine the Sun has grown\r\ndimmer. Is it really only my imagination?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. It becomes dimmer, but not perceptibly. Solar radiation is\r\nelectronic, and the theory is that our Sun has merely exhausted an\r\nouter sheath of electrons. Lord knows what internal condition caused\r\nit! If it\'s a solid body, it may be due to certain peculiarities of\r\nthe strata. The sun spots of hundreds of years ago must have been the\r\nbeginning of the end."\r\n\r\nShe nodded. "How is the work coming?"\r\n\r\n"The Traction Rays? Slowly, Olana--too slowly." Curt shook his head\r\nin weariness. "We\'re in the process of testing, but they are still\r\nnot strong enough. It means months more of work, and we shall need\r\nhundreds! You know, if we fail on the first attempt we shall not have\r\nanother chance."\r\n\r\n"I--I still don\'t quite understand it," Olana was puzzled. "I know it\r\nhas something to do with the orbit of Vulcan. But how can it save us?"\r\n\r\n"It may not. 

It\'s a forlorn chance. You know of course that Vulcan\'s a\r\nvery small planet, scarcely larger than Earth\'s moon. And it pursues\r\nan orbit much closer to the Sun than Mercury. If we can drive it out of\r\nits orbit with the Traction Rays, it may fall into the Sun!"\r\n\r\n"But suppose," Olana pointed out, "it only takes up a closer orbit?"\r\n\r\n"Exactly why we\'re taking no chances. We must be sure our rays are\r\nstrong enough to _propel_ it into the Sun."\r\n\r\n"And what then?

"\r\n\r\nCurt shrugged. 

"After that it\'s anybody\'s guess. Professor Marston\r\nbelieves that such a collision will set up a combustion sufficient to\r\nrelease internal electronic action from the Sun\'s depths. And, once\r\nthat is started, the Sun will blaze again."\r\n\r\n"I see," Olana exclaimed. "Something like stirring up dying embers!"\r\n\r\n"Yes." There was no eagerness in Curt\'s voice. "No doubt there are\r\nforces within the Sun sufficient to last for millennia, if they could\r\nonly be released. But they must be deep within. I\'m afraid nothing we\r\ndo with Vulcan will be enough."\r\n\r\n"Why, you\'re just a pessimist!"\r\n\r\nCurt smiled wanly. "No, just realistic. And very tired! It\'s been a\r\ntrying week. 

Come, we\'d better be getting back."\r\n\r\n"Wait." Olana stopped him. She was gazing at the blackness beyond the\r\nhorizon\'s rim. "Curt, look."\r\n\r\n"Meteor?" He followed her gaze. "No! I never saw a meteor like _that_!"\r\n\r\nThey saw a patch of light against the reddish sunglow. It wasn\'t\r\nextended light, it seemed to move as a bulk and with such speed as no\r\nmeteor had ever attained. For half a minute they watched it become\r\nsmaller--then it disappeared. Curt shook his head in puzzlement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _They saw a patch of light against the reddish sunglow._]\r\n\r\n"That beats me! For a minute I had a feeling--yes, I was _right_! It\r\nwent straight into the Sun! Olana--!"\r\n\r\nBut she had seen, too. She was scarcely aware of Curt\'s fierce grip on\r\nher arm.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDirectly in the center of the maroon Sun a tiny pinpoint of white had\r\nappeared. Even as they watched, it seemed to mushroom slowly outward.\r\n\r\n"That was no meteor!" Curt exclaimed. "Whatever caused that explosion\r\nwas travelling at the speed of light, and must have had tremendous\r\nbulk! Why ... I doubt if even Vulcan striking with its orbital velocity\r\ncould cause such a display!"\r\n\r\nFor an hour they watched. 

At the end of that time the whitish glow had\r\ngiven no sign of receding; if anything, it had become ever so slightly\r\nlarger. They stared, entranced with a new hope.\r\n\r\nAt last Olana placed a hand on Curt\'s arm and murmured, "God, in his\r\ninscrutable wisdom...."\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


"\r\n\r\nThis was more like it. If Brigadier General Straut could have this\r\nthing wrapped up by the time Washington awoke to the fact that it was\r\nsomething big--well, he\'d been waiting a long time for that second\r\nstar. This was his chance, and he would damn well make the most of it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe looked across the field at the thing. It was half in and half out\r\nof the woods, flat-sided, round-ended, featureless. Maybe he should go\r\nover and give it a closer look personally. 

He might spot something the\r\nothers were missing. It might blow them all to kingdom come any second;\r\nbut what the hell, he had earned his star on sheer guts in Normandy. He\r\nstill had \'em.\r\n\r\nHe keyed the phone. "I\'m coming down, Bill," he told the Major.\r\nOn impulse, he strapped a pistol belt on. Not much use against a\r\nhouse-sized bomb, but the heft of it felt good.\r\n\r\nThe thing looked bigger than ever as the jeep approached it, bumping\r\nacross the muck of the freshly plowed field. From here he could see a\r\nfaint line running around, just below the juncture of side and top.\r\nMajor Greer hadn\'t mentioned that. The line was quite obvious; in\r\nfact, it was more of a crack.\r\n\r\nWith a sound like a baseball smacking the catcher\'s glove, the crack\r\nopened, the upper half tilted, men sliding--then impossibly it stood\r\nopen, vibrating, like the roof of a house suddenly lifted. The driver\r\ngunned the jeep. There were cries, and a ragged shrilling that set\r\nStraut\'s teeth on edge. The men were running back now, two of them\r\ndragging a third.\r\n\r\nMajor Greer emerged from behind the object, looked about, ran toward\r\nGeneral Straut shouting. "... a man dead. It snapped; we weren\'t\r\nexpecting it...."\r\n\r\nStraut jumped out beside the men, who had stopped now and were looking\r\nback. The underside of the gaping lid was an iridescent black. The\r\nshrill noise sounded thinly across the field. Greer arrived, panting.\r\n\r\n"What happened?" Straut snapped.\r\n\r\n"I was ... checking over that thin spot, General. The first thing I\r\nknew it was ... coming up under me. I fell; Tate was at the other side.\r\nHe held on and it snapped him loose, against a tree. His skull--"\r\n\r\n"What the devil\'s that racket?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s the sound we were getting from inside before, General. There\'s\r\nsomething in there, alive--"\r\n\r\n"All right, pull yourself together, Major. We\'re not unprepared. Bring\r\nyour half-tracks into position. The tanks will be here soon."\r\n\r\nStraut glanced at the men standing about. He would show them what\r\nleadership meant.\r\n\r\n"You men keep back," he said. He puffed his cigar calmly as he walked\r\ntoward the looming object. The noise stopped suddenly; that was a\r\nrelief. There was a faint and curious odor in the air, something like\r\nchlorine ... or seaweed ... or iodine.\r\n\r\nThere were no marks in the ground surrounding the thing. It had\r\napparently dropped straight in to its present position. It was heavy,\r\ntoo--the soft soil was displaced in a mound a foot high all along the\r\nside.\r\n\r\nBehind him, Straut heard a yell. He whirled. The men were pointing;\r\nthe jeep started up, churned toward him, wheels spinning. He looked\r\nup. Over the edge of the gray wall, six feet above his head, a great\r\nreddish limb, like the claw of a crab, moved, groping.\r\n\r\nStraut yanked the .45 from its holster, jacked the action and fired.\r\nSoft matter spattered, and the claw jerked back. The screeching started\r\nup again angrily, then was drowned in the engine roar as the jeep slid\r\nto a stop.\r\n\r\nStraut stooped, grabbed up a leaf to which a quivering lump adhered,\r\njumped into the vehicle as it leaped forward; then a shock and they\r\nwere going into a spin and....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Lucky it was soft ground," somebody said. And somebody else asked,\r\n"What about the driver?"\r\n\r\nSilence. Straut opened his eyes. "What ... about...."\r\n\r\nA stranger was looking down at him, an ordinary-looking fellow of about\r\nthirty-five.\r\n\r\n"Easy, now, General Straut. You\'ve had a bad spill. 

Everything is all\r\nright. 

I\'m Professor Lieberman, from the University."\r\n\r\n"The driver," Straut said with an effort.\r\n\r\n"He was killed when the jeep went over."\r\n\r\n"Went ... over?"\r\n\r\n"The creature lashed out with a member resembling a scorpion\'s stinger.\r\nIt struck the jeep and flipped it. You were thrown clear. 

The driver\r\njumped and the jeep rolled on him."\r\n\r\nStraut pushed himself up.\r\n\r\n"Where\'s Greer?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m right here, sir." Major Greer stepped up, stood attentively.\r\n\r\n"Those tanks here yet?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir. 

I had a call from General Margrave; there\'s some sort of\r\nholdup. Something about not destroying scientific material. I did get\r\nthe mortars over from the base."\r\n\r\nStraut got to his feet. The stranger took his arm. "You ought to lie\r\ndown, General--"\r\n\r\n"Who the hell is going to make me? Greer, get those mortars in place,\r\nspaced between your tracks."\r\n\r\nThe telephone rang. Straut seized it. "General Straut."\r\n\r\n"General Margrave here, Straut. I\'m glad you\'re back on your feet.\r\nThere\'ll be some scientists from the State University coming over.\r\nCooperate with them. You\'re going to have to hold things together at\r\nleast until I can get another man in there to--"\r\n\r\n"Another man? General Margrave, I\'m not incapacitated. The situation is\r\nunder complete control--"\r\n\r\n"It is, is it? I understand you\'ve got still another casualty. What\'s\r\nhappened to your defensive capabilities?"\r\n\r\n"That was an accident, sir. The jeep--"\r\n\r\n"We\'ll review that matter at a later date. What I\'m calling about is\r\nmore important right now. The code men have made some headway on that\r\nbox of yours. It\'s putting out a sort of transmission."\r\n\r\n"What kind, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Half the message--it\'s only twenty seconds long, repeated--is in\r\nEnglish. It\'s a fragment of a recording from a daytime radio program;\r\none of the network men here identified it. The rest is gibberish.\r\nThey\'re still working over it."\r\n\r\n"What--"\r\n\r\n"Bryant tells me he thinks there may be some sort of correspondence\r\nbetween the two parts of the message. I wouldn\'t know, myself. In my\r\nopinion, it\'s a threat of some sort."\r\n\r\n"I agree, General. An ultimatum."\r\n\r\n"Right. Keep your men back at a safe distance from now on. I want no\r\nmore casualties."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nStraut cursed his luck as he hung up the phone. Margrave was ready to\r\nrelieve him, after he had exercised every precaution. He had to do\r\nsomething fast, before this opportunity for promotion slipped out of\r\nhis hands.\r\n\r\nHe looked at Major Greer. "I\'m neutralizing this thing once and for\r\nall. There\'ll be no more men killed."\r\n\r\nLieberman stood up. "General! I must protest any attack against this--"\r\n\r\nStraut whirled. "I\'m handling this, Professor. I don\'t know who let\r\nyou in here or why--but I\'ll make the decisions. I\'m stopping this\r\nman-killer before it comes out of its nest, maybe gets into that\r\nvillage beyond the woods. There are four thousand civilians there. 

It\'s\r\nmy job to protect them." 

He jerked his head at Greer, strode out of the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nLieberman followed, pleading. "The creature has shown no signs of\r\naggressiveness, General Straut--"\r\n\r\n"With two men dead?"\r\n\r\n"You should have kept them back--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, it was my fault, was it?" Straut stared at Lieberman with cold\r\nfury. This civilian pushed his way in here, then had the infernal gall\r\nto accuse him, Brigadier General Straut, of causing the death of his\r\nown men. If he had the fellow in uniform for five minutes....\r\n\r\n"You\'re not well, General. That fall--"\r\n\r\n"Keep out of my way, Professor," Straut said. He turned and went on\r\ndown the stairs. The present foul-up could ruin his career; and now\r\nthis egghead interference....\r\n\r\nWith Greer at his side, Straut moved out to the edge of the field.\r\n\r\n"All right, Major. Open up with your .50 calibers.

"\r\n\r\nGreer called a command and a staccato rattle started up. The smell of\r\ncordite and the blue haze of gunsmoke--this was more like it. He was in\r\ncommand here.\r\n\r\nLieberman came up to Straut. "General, I appeal to you in the name of\r\nscience. Hold off a little longer; at least until we learn what the\r\nmessage is about."\r\n\r\n"Get back from the firing line, Professor." Straut turned his back\r\non the civilian, raised the glasses to observe the effect of the\r\nrecoilless rifle. There was a tremendous smack of displaced air, and\r\na thunderous boom as the explosive shell struck. Straut saw the gray\r\nshape jump, the raised lid waver. Dust rose from about it. There was no\r\nother effect.\r\n\r\n"Keep firing, Greer," Straut snapped, almost with a feeling of triumph.\r\nThe thing was impervious to artillery; now who was going to say it was\r\nno threat?\r\n\r\n"How about the mortars, sir?" Greer said. 

"We can drop a few rounds\r\nright inside it."\r\n\r\n"All right, try that before the lid drops."\r\n\r\nAnd what we\'ll try next, I don\'t know, he thought.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe mortar fired with a muffled thud. Straut watched tensely. Five\r\nseconds later, the object erupted in a gout of pale pink debris. The\r\nlid rocked, pinkish fluid running down its opalescent surface. 

A\r\nsecond burst, and a third. A great fragment of the menacing claw hung\r\nfrom the branch of a tree a hundred feet from the ship.\r\n\r\nStraut grabbed up the phone. "Cease fire!"\r\n\r\nLieberman stared in horror at the carnage.\r\n\r\nThe telephone rang. Straut picked it up.\r\n\r\n"General Straut," he said. His voice was firm. He had put an end to the\r\nthreat.\r\n\r\n"Straut, we\'ve broken the message," General Margrave said excitedly.\r\n"It\'s the damnedest thing I ever...."\r\n\r\nStraut wanted to interrupt, announce his victory, but Margrave was\r\ndroning on.\r\n\r\n"... strange sort of reasoning, but there was a certain analogy. In any\r\nevent, I\'m assured the translation is accurate. 

Here\'s how it reads in\r\nEnglish...."\r\n\r\nStraut listened. Then he carefully placed the receiver back on the hook.\r\n\r\nLieberman stared at him.\r\n\r\n"What did it say?

"\r\n\r\nStraut cleared his throat. He turned and looked at Lieberman for a long\r\nmoment before answering.\r\n\r\n"It said, \'Please take good care of my little girl.\'"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sun had not yet taken the chill out of the early April morning that\r\nbroke on the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, when the ship settled to\r\nthe ground. It was surprisingly large compared to the aircraft native\r\nto this planet, and yet ridiculously small to have brought enough men\r\nand material to launch an invasion across light years of space.\r\n\r\nThe landing went unobserved in this fearful year of 1955. The world\r\nfaced too many crucial crises of their own making to consider the\r\nnecessity to be watchful for an extra-terrestrial invasion.\r\n\r\nHardly had the craft come to rest, when the outer lock slid noiselessly\r\nopen and a small ladder-like stairway came down until it too had\r\ntouched earth.\r\n\r\nA man appeared in the doorway, pausing to study the landscape which\r\nlay before him. His features, his body, were human. Despite his being\r\ntoo well muscled, and his face unusually handsome, he would never have\r\naroused suspicion of being from another planet.\r\n\r\nGrunting in satisfaction, he permitted himself the pleasure of being\r\nproud at having landed so near the cabin chosen as his goal. It had\r\nbeen a wise choice, this picking of so well isolated a place as a\r\ntesting ground for the weapon. A wisp of smoke, a dark smudge against\r\nthe rich blueness of the sky, attested to the cabin\'s occupancy. What\r\nhe was about to do seemed fitting, for even the scientists of this\r\nplanet had used animal life to test their own puny weapons. Now he,\r\nman, would be the guinea pig to prove the devastation to be wrought\r\nagainst all mankind native to this world.\r\n\r\nHe turned and spoke to someone within the lock. His language, while\r\nresembling no earthly tongue, was not much different than perhaps\r\nEnglish to Chinese. It was foreign but not completely alien.\r\n\r\nWith the ease of a man accustomed to heavier gravity he went down the\r\nladder easily, turning when he reached the ground to look up at the\r\nlock.\r\n\r\nAnd then to the edge of the air lock, she came--the weapon! There had\r\nbeen no doubt in the minds of her creators as to her effectiveness--she\r\nwould conquer this planet. The armed might of Earth would vanish\r\nbefore her. Before the year had ended the invasion would have been\r\naccomplished. As a weapon, the Earth\'s H-Bomb might well be a mere\r\nfirecracker. She had been tested against the men of her own planet and\r\nfound to be irresistible, but now would come the final test against the\r\nenemy without laboratory-controlled conditions.\r\n\r\nThe planet she had come from is unimportant, suffice to say their\r\ntechnology had conquered space over a thousand years ago. For over\r\nhalf that time they had subjugated neighboring worlds until their rule\r\nhad spread to the borders of Earth. Scouting ships had been spying on\r\nEarth for the past two centuries and had brought back alarming reports\r\nconcerning the rapidly expanding technology of this planet.\r\n\r\nSoon after the aliens had discovered the secret of space flight had\r\ncome the added knowledge planets could be conquered by other than the\r\nforce of arms. Psychological warfare had been developed to a fantastic\r\ndegree, making weapons more potent than any bombs of fissionable\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nThere she stood, a monument to her creators. Eve, soon to be conqueror\r\nof the planet Earth.\r\n\r\nTo attempt description of her beauty would be an impossibility, for the\r\nlanguages of man do not contain the necessary word-symbols to express\r\nthe utter perfection of her face and form. To each man she would appear\r\ndifferent, for he would see in her the substance of his unconscious\r\ndesires for the woman he had never dreamed might exist. For this\r\npurpose the scientists had labored in their laboratories for nearly a\r\nhalf century, and now she would justify the time and effort spent in\r\nher creation.\r\n\r\nGently, she smiled at the man waiting below, and despite the special\r\nconditioning he had undergone, and the drugs he took with careful\r\nregularity for added protection, he almost surrendered to the impulse\r\nto throw himself at her feet; to beg for only the privilege to serve\r\nher, to obey her, and to worship her.\r\n\r\nOut of the entire space fleet, he, Commander Ydnas, after extensive\r\npsychological testing, had been selected for this task. The three\r\nmonths of conditioning had passed rapidly, his response to the\r\ntreatments had been better than they had dared to hope. 

In the two\r\nweeks of their flight he had been unaffected by her presence, and now\r\nupon landing he was beginning to feel the strain he was under. He\r\nwondered what would have happened had it not been for the added help of\r\nthe drugs?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHis face betrayed none of the anxiety he now felt. It was an impassive\r\nmask, his body was ramrod tense and erect.\r\n\r\nShe came down the steps gracefully, her litheness would have made the\r\nmovements of a cat seem awkward and clumsy.\r\n\r\nBoth had been thoroughly trained in the languages needed to carry out\r\nthe plan of invasion, English and Russian. First, the large continent\r\nof North America would be disarmed at her command; and then they would\r\nmove across the large body of water to Europe. Russia would be their\r\ninitial target there. The invasion timetable called for a three month\r\ncampaign, and then Eve would be removed from the planet before the\r\noccupation fleet from the mother world would land. Not a man would be\r\nlost, nor a space ship damaged, and yet the planet\'s rich potential\r\nwould be theirs for the taking.\r\n\r\nAnd what of Eve? She was too dangerous to be permitted to return to her\r\ncreators. Commander Ydnas had his instructions covering the final phase\r\nof the invasion plan. When her task of disarming Earth was completed,\r\nand the planet lay helpless to defend itself, they would blast off into\r\nspace together. Soon as Earth\'s atmosphere was left behind, she would\r\nbe slain, her body incinerated through the rocket tubes.\r\n\r\nIt seemed such a dreadful waste to destroy such beauty of perfection,\r\nbut the Commander, raised from infancy to be a space officer, realized\r\nthe need for her disposal. After the need for a weapon has passed, it\r\nis safer to destroy it then risk the danger of trying to store it. Even\r\non this world they dumped their poison gases into the seas and did the\r\nsame with the more volatile explosives.\r\n\r\n"Come," he said, starting toward the cabin. When she would have taken\r\nhis hand, he brushed it aside angrily. 

Even the work the psychologists\r\nhad done to condition him, and the strength of the drugs, could be\r\ntrusted only up to a point. He feared what her touch might do to the\r\niron discipline with which he kept himself in check.\r\n\r\nThe only response to his rebuff, was a shrug of those magnificently\r\nrounded shoulders, and a lazy half-smile of amusement.\r\n\r\nHer creators had considered it a bit of ironic humor to name her so\r\noutlandish and yet befitting a name as Eve. For her namesake too had\r\nbeen a temptress bringing about the calamities of mankind, and now eons\r\nlater another Eve would end the supremacy of man.\r\n\r\nAt the door of the cabin the commander paused. His eyes sought those of\r\nthe woman. She stood regarding him strangely, and for the first time he\r\nfound himself wondering what she must feel about her part in bringing\r\nabout the defeat of a world? She had no control over her actions. She\r\nwas conditioned to follow the tenets of the master plan. He wished he\r\nhad not held himself so aloof from her during the flight. Now there was\r\nno time to question what she felt. And after the invasion for her there\r\nwould be only destruction.\r\n\r\nAnnoyed with himself, he turned back to the door, his knuckles sounded\r\ndully against the thickness of the wood. 

He waited impatiently,\r\nreceiving no answer to his knocking. With one hand near the weapon in\r\nhis belt, he reached out and lifted the latch.\r\n\r\nGesturing for Eve to remain outside, he stepped over the threshold.\r\n\r\nA man dozed in the large chair before the still smouldering fireplace.\r\nWhen the cool air reached him he shivered and opened his eyes.\r\n\r\n"I am Commander Ydnas."\r\n\r\nThe man gazed at him blankly, his sleep-stained face bewildered at the\r\nrude awakening. He seemed unimpressed by the military splendor of the\r\ncommander\'s uniform.\r\n\r\nThe commander eyed the man with mild contempt. This would do as a\r\nguinea pig to prove the effectiveness of Eve. Here too would be an\r\nexcellent base of operations. The man could supply many useful details\r\nneeded before the invasion could begin.\r\n\r\n"Eve," he called. "Come in!"\r\n\r\nShe entered the room reluctantly, her gaze pitying the man seated so\r\nstrangely still in his chair. She waited for his expression to change\r\nwhen he saw her. 

In a moment he would be grovelling at her feet. Eve\r\nhated what she was doing, but the patterns implanted in her brain by\r\nthe creators made it impossible for her to resist.\r\n\r\nThe Commander\'s stern jaw relaxed, his mouth fell open in shock.\r\nImpossible! Incredible! The man continued to remain motionless,\r\nregarding them with annoyed perplexity.\r\n\r\nThe scientists had blundered; earth beings were not creatures governed\r\nby their emotions. The data collected by the spy ships had been\r\nerroneous, the invasion would fail.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nInstinctively he looked to the woman. Eve watched him in open\r\namusement, and he wondered if he had not caught a glimpse of sympathy\r\nin her eyes. She knew what this meant to him. No man returned to the\r\nmother planet in defeat. If he did not follow the time-honored custom\r\nof self-destruction to atone for his failure, he would face a quick\r\ndeath when he returned.\r\n\r\n"What--what did you want?" asked the man, annoyance making his voice a\r\npetulant whine.\r\n\r\n"Nothing, sir. We made a mistake. 

I\'m afraid we came to the wrong\r\nplace."\r\n\r\nThe Commander turned to Eve, his face transformed by a smile for the\r\nfirst time since they had been together.\r\n\r\n"I know of an asteroid that is pretty well out of the space lanes. It\r\nhas an atmosphere and can support life without a great struggle on our\r\npart. 

Do you think you could like it there? Of course, it wouldn\'t be\r\nmuch of a world for you to conquer, and I would be the only man to\r\nserve you ... but...."\r\n\r\nShe studied him thoughtfully, and then in answer to what he had asked,\r\nshe took his arm. They left the cabin together, walking very closely.\r\n\r\nIt must have seemed a cosmic joke to the gods of the universe to see\r\nthe invader and the woman, who was to have been his weapon, pause and\r\nwave a casual farewell to the planet they had come to conquer.\r\n\r\n"Asteroid," the man mused aloud. "What kind of crazy gibberish had they\r\nbeen talking? 

Must be honeymooners from one of the nearby resorts."\r\n\r\nHe shrugged in an attempt to dismiss it from his mind, maybe he ought\r\nto ask Helen about it when she got back. Come to think of it she should\r\nbe back with the supplies any minute now.\r\n\r\nThere was a strange roar from outside, and the sound of some great\r\nobject hurtling through the air, but strangely enough the man did\r\nnot leap from his chair and rush to the door to see what created the\r\ndisturbance.\r\n\r\nHe did not move from the fireplace until the chill had begun to fill\r\nthe cabin, and then reluctantly he stood up fumbling along the side of\r\nthe chair for some object leaning against it.\r\n\r\nWhen he located it, he grasped it tightly, and then made his way\r\ncautiously to the door. He shifted the stick to his left hand fumbling\r\nfor the latch. Locating it he closed the door.\r\n\r\nThe invaders had come ... and left in defeat. But the victor would\r\nnever know he had beaten off the first invasion of Earth, saving\r\nmankind from slavery and civilization from destruction. To him they\r\nwere mere voices babbling meaningless words. The splendor of their\r\nspace ship, the wondrous fatal beauty of the woman never would be known\r\nto him ... for he was totally blind!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


But as a newspaper\r\n           reporter, Bennet had the job of keeping facts and\r\n           fancies separate. He was good at that--too good!\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n          Science Fiction Adventures Magazine, February 1953.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nI found Johnny a few blocks from our hotel in a little bar that was\r\nnearly deserted. He was sitting alone at a table in a dark corner,\r\nstaring morosely at nothing in particular, his hand limp around an\r\nalmost-empty glass. He seemed perfectly sober, though his eyes stared\r\nglassily ahead.\r\n\r\nI sat down beside him. "What do you say we go back to the hotel,\r\nJohnny? Tomorrow\'s another slave day."\r\n\r\nHis eyes shifted to me and then back to nothing. I wondered if he had\r\nactually seen me.\r\n\r\n"We can talk about it over some coffee and a bit to eat."\r\n\r\nI suggested, placing my hand on his arm.\r\n\r\n"Go to hell," he said quietly and shook me loose. He lifted his glass,\r\ndrained the last few drops. He held the empty glass to the light, then\r\nset it down, regretfully. "But first buy me a drink."\r\n\r\n"You\'d better go home," I said. "You\'ve had enough."\r\n\r\nHe laughed harshly. "Look who\'s giving me orders. I know things about\r\nthis cock-eyed old world you never had nightmares about, and you\'re\r\nordering me around! Bossy newspapermen! Go to hell, then; I\'ll get my\r\nown drink."\r\n\r\nHe rose unsteadily and managed his way to the bar. He came back with\r\nthe glass full.\r\n\r\n"You still here. I thought I told you--"\r\n\r\n"You\'d better lay off that stuff," I said quietly. "You\'re not used to\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Boy, oh boy, you\'re just full of orders today, aren\'t you? Charlie\r\nBennet, boy crusader! Well, I\'ve got something you can crusade about.\r\nAnything else you\'d like?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s enough for now."\r\n\r\n"You\'re damn right it is. Now get the hell out of here and leave me\r\nalone. Can\'t you see I\'m brooding over the fate of the world?"\r\n\r\n"What are you so mad about?"\r\n\r\nHe looked annoyed, and a little startled. "Brother, if you only knew--"\r\nHe raised his glass, and then stopped and set it on the table. "Wait a\r\nminute. 

Maybe I ought to tell you. Maybe I ought to let the two of us\r\nworry about it, instead of just me. Maybe you should print it in that\r\nnewspaper of yours."\r\n\r\n"I\'m willing to listen, anyway."\r\n\r\n"Sure! Why not? I\'m just beginning to experience that rosy sensation,\r\nthat warm feeling of camaraderie they keep stoppered up in bottles.\r\nIt\'s the only place on this planet you can find it."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be cynical."\r\n\r\n"Maybe I should bust out laughing. The whole thing\'s really funny; it\'s\r\nthe funniest thing I\'ve ever heard."\r\n\r\n"We\'d better go."\r\n\r\n"Sure, let\'s go. But first--you want to see something really funny?\r\nHere."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe took a pair of glasses from his pocket and handed them to me. They\r\nseemed like ordinary shell-rimmed glasses, though the lenses were\r\ntinted a slight blue.\r\n\r\n"Put them on," he prompted. "Go ahead."\r\n\r\n"Where\'d you get these?"\r\n\r\n"Made \'em," he said. "My job is optical research, remember. I was\r\nfooling around in the lab with some invisible light experiments. The\r\nright combination of lenses and coatings--and whammo! This." 

He took\r\na drink. "I should have been a lawyer or a plumber or something." He\r\ngrunted. 

"Or even a newspaperman!"\r\n\r\n"What are they supposed to do--see in the dark?"\r\n\r\nHe laughed humorlessly. "That\'d be a boon for a reporter, wouldn\'t it?\r\nNo, my friend, much worse than that. Try them on. 

Go ahead."\r\n\r\nI did. "Well?

"\r\n\r\n"Notice anything peculiar?"\r\n\r\n"The coating makes everything here seem bluish--maybe even unearthly,\r\nif that\'s what you want--but--"\r\n\r\n"C\'mon outside, then," he said. This time he took my arm and steered me\r\nfrom the bar. I was glad of the opportunity to get him into the night\r\nair.\r\n\r\n"Look at the sky," he directed. "See anything unusual?" He stood\r\nwaiting, expectant.\r\n\r\n"I see stars," I said. "Nothing unusual about that, is there?"\r\n\r\n"Stars! Only stars?" His voice had lost its tinge of sarcasm. His\r\nfingers were tight on my arm. "Look, across the sky, see those luminous\r\nbands? All across the sky. Like a giant spider web."\r\n\r\nI looked again. After awhile, I said, "Sorry, Johnny, but there aren\'t\r\nany luminous bands, spider webs or otherwise. I think we\'d better get\r\nto the room. A good night\'s rest--"\r\n\r\n"Wait a minute," he cried suddenly, his face pale. "You think I\'m\r\ndrunk--or worse. I tell you there _is_ something up there. Shining\r\nstreamers crisscrossing the sky, like--like--"\r\n\r\n"There\'s nothing, Johnny. Only stars."\r\n\r\nI took the glasses off. He made a quick grab for them and somehow they\r\nfell to the pavement and shattered.\r\n\r\nFor a moment, Johnny stared at the glittering fragments, his jaws\r\nworking. "You\'ve broken them," he accused finally, his eyes filled more\r\nwith sudden despair than hatred. "It took weeks to build them."\r\n\r\n"It was an accident," I told him. "But it\'s just as well they are\r\nbroken. I tell you, Johnny, there\'s nothing unusual in the sky. Nothing\r\nat all. Spider webs! Next you\'ll be seeing pink elephants."\r\n\r\nJohnny stood in the cool night and stared at the sky. "They\'re up\r\nthere, I tell you. They\'re up there, and I want to know why. And\r\nthere\'s one thing I want to know more than anything else; suppose\r\nthey\'re really spider webs--" His face was deathly white. "Are there\r\nspiders?"\r\n\r\nHe stared at me insanely in the darkness. "Do you realize what that\r\nwould mean, Charlie? Giant spiders, invisible, roaming across the\r\nEarth!" His fingers were digging into my arm again.\r\n\r\n"Johnny, come out of it," I snapped, shaking him. "There is no web in\r\nthe sky, you hear me? And there aren\'t any spiders, either. It\'s just\r\nsome crazy figment of your imagination. 

That\'s all."\r\n\r\n"But just suppose there are," he persisted, a little wildly.\r\n"Maybe--maybe it\'s not just the glasses. Maybe it\'s partly me, too;\r\nmaybe I\'m the only one who can see them; maybe that\'s why you didn\'t\r\nsee the web. Maybe--"\r\n\r\n"Johnny, be sensible! If there were such monsters roaming around, don\'t\r\nyou think they\'d have been discovered by now?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," he said, helplessly. "I don\'t know, and it\'s driving\r\nme crazy. You\'ve probably wondered why I haven\'t slept very well for\r\nthe past couple of weeks; well, that\'s the reason. I didn\'t want to say\r\nanything. I hardly dared put the glasses on, I was so afraid. Not of\r\nbeing thought crazy, but--but afraid of what _they_ might do if they\r\nknew they were discovered."\r\n\r\n"Look, Johnny. Even supposing you might be right, why wouldn\'t they\r\nshow themselves? Why just stay up in the sky in a large web?"\r\n\r\n"Maybe they\'re sizing us up," Johnny said, trembling but not with cold.\r\n"After all, we\'ve got a few weapons, too. Maybe a machine gun or an\r\natomic bomb can hurt them, as well as humans."\r\n\r\n"Unless they\'re here for some good?" I suggested.\r\n\r\nJohnny laughed. "Spiders? Maybe they\'re hungry--and they think we\'re a\r\nbunch of flies down here. That\'s more likely.

"\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t this--rather fantastic?"\r\n\r\n"Of course it is. Why do you suppose I\'ve been keeping quiet about\r\nit for the past two weeks? Why do you suppose I\'m out trying to get\r\ndrunk?" He added disgustedly: "I can\'t even do that."\r\n\r\n"C\'mon," I said, "let\'s go to the room and we\'ll have some coffee. We\r\ncan talk about it there."\r\n\r\n"Sure," he said, and his voice was suddenly subdued. 

"Sure, why not?"\r\n\r\nWe went to the hotel room and I made some coffee, being careful to\r\nslip enough sleeping tablets in Johnny\'s cup. In a few minutes he was\r\nsprawled across the bed.\r\n\r\nI went to the window and looked at the glowing beads of traffic below.\r\nI looked at the sky--at the stars. Spiders in the sky; what a story\r\nthat would make. The editor\'d slap me in the booby hatch if I ever\r\nhanded in a who-what-when-where like that.\r\n\r\nWhen I left for work the next morning, Johnny was still snoozing. Let\r\nhim sleep it off. Do him good. He\'d been working too hard at the lab,\r\nanyhow.\r\n\r\nI couldn\'t get back to the hotel room that morning, though I wanted to\r\nsee if Johnny was okay. I was pretty busy writing a human interest yarn\r\nkidding the pants off some astronomer\'s notion that light waves coming\r\nfrom certain portions of the sky were being deflected or refracted\r\nslightly for no discernible reason.\r\n\r\nThe amount of difference was microscopic, and I wrote it up to\r\nemphasize its ridiculous splitting of hairs and the fact that you can\'t\r\ntake some of these crackpots seriously. Here the world is on the verge\r\nof coming apart at the seams, and they worry about wayward light rays.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon, I managed to drop into the hotel to see if Johnny\r\nhad slept off the liquor and the sleeping tablets. He had, and he was\r\nsitting on the edge of the bed, looking grim--and a little perplexed.\r\n\r\n"How ya feeling, Johnny?" I said.\r\n\r\n"Great," he said, though he didn\'t sound it. "Things seem a lot clearer\r\nthis morning."\r\n\r\n"Good. I thought they would. You know, you really had me going last\r\nnight. I thought you meant all that stuff, but I guess imagination and\r\na few beers can do a lot."\r\n\r\n"Cut the kidding," he said grimly.\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"I said, cut it. I\'m not in the mood."\r\n\r\n"Now what\'s the matter?

"\r\n\r\n"This," he said. He held up a pair of glasses, twins to those destroyed.\r\n\r\n"But--how could you have made another set? You haven\'t been near the\r\nlab today."\r\n\r\n"When I first discovered this web business, I made two pair of glasses.\r\nI figured two people could do something about it a whole lot easier\r\nthan just one. But I was afraid to let anyone in on it. I thought maybe\r\nI _was_ batty."\r\n\r\n"So?"\r\n\r\n"I made this pair for you. For you, Charlie, so you could write the\r\nstuff up in your paper to let people know. That\'s a laugh, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Say--that\'s swell. 

But--"\r\n\r\n"Stand back!" Johnny cried suddenly, as I started to move toward him.\r\nHe snatched a gun from beneath a pillow and waved it threateningly.\r\n"Know what I was doing this afternoon before you came in?"\r\n\r\n"Johnny, this is crazy! Put down that gun and listen to reason."\r\n\r\n"I had the glasses on," he continued, "and I was looking out the window\r\nhere. I\'m getting real brave--even in broad daylight--but there comes\r\na time when you just don\'t care. I saw _spiders_ in the streets. Huge\r\nspiders walking along the streets, mingling with human beings. And\r\nget this, Charlie--when I took the glasses off, they were like human\r\nbeings. Like humans, you understand. 

You know what that means? They\'re\r\nin disguise all around us!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s not true, Johnny," I insisted. "There are no webs in the sky.\r\nThere are _no_ spiders. It\'s your imagination. 

The strain. Working in\r\nthe lab--"\r\n\r\n"No," he cried, and the gun never wavered. "You know what else I saw? 

A\r\nfew minutes ago. I was looking down into the street, and a spider got\r\nout of a car just in front of the hotel here and started coming in. I\r\ntook off the glasses to see if it might be someone I knew.

"\r\n\r\nHe began to laugh hysterically. "You know who it was, Charlie--"\r\n\r\nI leaped forward, trying to knock the gun down. But Johnny\'s hand came\r\nup, and the gun jumped, spurting noise and flame. The bullet slammed\r\ninto my body.\r\n\r\nDesperately, I drove forward. My arms went around him. The gun went\r\noff again, before I could prevent it. A furrow of pain shot across my\r\nstomach, and I shrieked out in sudden anguish.\r\n\r\n"Johnny, Johnny. Stop it. Stop!"\r\n\r\nI struck his hand. The gun clattered to the floor. He was struggling\r\nfrantically, striking out against me with doubled fists. His shirt was\r\nsplattered with my blood. He gasped, clearing his lungs for a scream.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing else I could do. The life was draining from me.\r\n\r\nI held his arms and legs together and tried not to look into the\r\nterrified expression crossing his face. I held him tightly while he\r\nsquirmed in helpless frustration.\r\n\r\nAnd with my two remaining arms I strangled him!\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt\'s had it. Finished. 

Done. My wonderful red Thunderflash, I thought\r\nto myself, isn\'t worth the electricity to atomize it to Kingdom Come.\r\n\r\nEver since that drunk in his two-seat Charioteer plowed into the rear\r\nend with such force that even my radar repellant couldn\'t stop it,\r\nmy Thunderflash had been out of kilter. The specialists my garage\r\nrecommended worked over it for two days, but couldn\'t get it to\r\nrunning the way it did new.\r\n\r\nAnd what was I supposed to do for an automobile now? I had signed the\r\ncustomary 40-year pact for half my salary to pay for it. That meant I\r\nwould still be shelling out by 2117.\r\n\r\nWeeping over it wasn\'t going to do any good. It was stuck on the fifth\r\nlevel expressway and that was that. I levered myself out (at least\r\nthe ejector still worked) then got behind the car and gave it a good\r\nold-fashioned push to get it on an off-ramp, out of the stream of\r\ntraffic.\r\n\r\nAfter I parked I remembered I was heading for a date with Jenny. I\r\nchecked my wallet. No, not enough for a taxi there. I would just have\r\nto phone her to cancel the date.\r\n\r\nReluctantly I pushed the tip of my tongue against my tooth telephone.\r\n\r\n"Operator," said the operator.\r\n\r\n"Poplar 3104, please."\r\n\r\n"Thank you. 

One moment. 

I\'ll ache it for you."\r\n\r\nShe dialed the number of the tooth telephone in Jenny\'s mouth, so the\r\ntwo fine wires sent gentle electric currents into the nerve. On the\r\nthird ache Jenny clicked the receiver open with the tip of her tongue.\r\n\r\n"Hello?"\r\n\r\n"Jenny, this is Arnold. I won\'t be able to come over this evening."\r\n\r\n"But we had a date," Jenny said in a petulant voice.\r\n\r\n"I know, but my car broke down."\r\n\r\n"Again?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, honey."\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you do something about it?" Jenny complained.\r\n\r\n"But baby, what can I do? I\'ve been to the garage. 

I\'ve been to the\r\nspecialists. I\'m so broke on account of these repair bills I\'ve been\r\nliving on macaroni concentrate for the last couple of weeks."\r\n\r\nJenny, my beautiful sweetheart, was distinctly unhappy. "Don\'t come to\r\nme with your troubles," she replied. "In fact, you don\'t have to come\r\nto me at all until you can come like a gentleman."\r\n\r\n"Aw, listen just a minute, Jenny," I started to plead. But it was too\r\nlate. Jenny had clicked off.\r\n\r\nA fine thermokettle of fish! A month ago I had a shiny lifetime car and\r\nwas romancing the best looking girl in town. Then one drunk comes along\r\nand my car is next to useless and my girl is mad at me.\r\n\r\nFeeling in a distinctly blue mood I moved my tongue to the other side\r\nof my mouth and shoved on my tooth radio. I rolled the tongue over the\r\nbottom of the tooth until I got a program with some blues music. Just\r\nthe way I felt. The blues. I sat in the front seat of my Thunderflash\r\nand listened to the music echoing against my tonsils.\r\n\r\nAfter the song came the inevitable commercial. Only this was a new one.\r\nThe announcer said:\r\n\r\n"Here\'s some big, big, big news from Grinning Gregory, your largest\r\nvolume dealer in lifetime cars. Gregory announced today that his used\r\npeople lots are nearly empty. Yes, Grinning Gregory\'s used people lots\r\nare nearly empty. And that means good, good, good news for you car\r\nowners with lifetime contracts who would like new cars.\r\n\r\n"Grinning Gregory has added to his stocks of new Orions,\r\nThunderflashes, Galaxies, Solars, Charioteers, Protons and Fords. For\r\nthe first time in two years, yes, the first time in two years, he has\r\nmore new cars than new people to sell them to.\r\n\r\n"So he is offering a limited number of them to used people, you folks\r\nwho have had cars, on his conveniently located used people lots. Come\r\non down and let some of Grinning Gregory\'s new cars look you over.\r\nBe sure and bring photostats of your credit ratings and official car\r\nhistories. Hurry, hurry, hurry and avoid the rush to Grinning Gregory\'s\r\nused people lots."\r\n\r\nThe commercial ended and was replaced by music.\r\n\r\nGosh, that was exciting news. Ever since the accident I had given up\r\nhope of ever owning a decent running car again, automobile prices and\r\ngovernment restrictions being what they were.\r\n\r\nI clicked on my tooth telephone and ached my garage mechanic to come\r\nby and pick up my car. Then I took my credit rating and official car\r\nhistory from the glove compartment and caught a helibus to the nearest\r\nof Grinning Gregory\'s used people lots.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA lot of guys were already there before me, most of them in the same\r\nfix I was. They had been in accidents or they were divorced and their\r\nwives got custody of the car, although they still had to pay for it.\r\n\r\nSome of them had been on the lot for some time and looked a little\r\nshopworn under the lights and fluttering pennants, but they hadn\'t\r\nfound a car yet that would take them. We were all classified as used\r\npeople, a lot less desirable than people who hadn\'t signed for cars yet.\r\n\r\nOne of Grinning Gregory\'s contract brokers lined us up in a row facing\r\nthe path the cars would come by robot direction. The fellow to my right\r\nslicked his hair down neatly and began shining his shoe-tops on the\r\nbacks of his trouser legs.\r\n\r\n"Sure hope I get selected," he whispered nervously to me. "Boy, don\'t\r\nyou sometimes wish you were living a couple of hundred years ago when\r\ncars were cheap enough so that people were doing the picking?

"\r\n\r\n"Not me," I told him. "Drive that junk? I\'ll admit you didn\'t have to\r\nswear but a couple of years of your life away. But look at all you get\r\nnow in a car.

"\r\n\r\n"Mmm, I suppose you\'re right," he said. "My Orion was stolen a year ago\r\nwhen I accidentally cut off the burglar photocell. The police never did\r\nfind it and I\'ve been trying ever since to get another one.

"\r\n\r\n"This is the first time I\'ve tried," I said. "My car...."\r\n\r\n"Ssh," he interrupted. "Here they come."\r\n\r\nA procession of new cars, led by a beautiful green Solar convertible,\r\ninched its way along the row of hopeful buyers, all of us with our\r\ncredit ratings and car histories pinned to our lapels.\r\n\r\nEach car\'s robot mechanism recorded our statistics, took our pictures,\r\nnoted our heights, weights and appearances, then began to correlate the\r\ndata.\r\n\r\nBy government order the robot mechanism was directed to select its\r\nmost promising future owner. A sobersides bank president, for example,\r\nmight dearly love to change his big black Galaxy sedan for a low-slung\r\nCharioteer sports car, but sports cars were planned with crew-cutted\r\ncollege boys in mind, so the bank president would be likely to end up\r\nwith another big Galaxy. Of course, the payment rate was fixed and the\r\ncontracts were almost always for 40 years. A tie salesman might want a\r\nGalaxy to make an impression on his neighbors, but he\'d probably wind\r\nup with a Proton or a Thunderflash like I had. I was a tie salesman.\r\n\r\nThe Solar came abreast of me. I stood straight and smiling as it began\r\nto note my statistics. It flashed a 23 when it was done.\r\n\r\nNot so good. That put me in the 23 percentile rank of its desirability.\r\nThe next car, a rhinestone Ford, gave me a 28. I was rated 22, 31, 14\r\n(by a Galaxy), 27, 35 and 30 by the next six cars. That was the way it\r\nwent for the whole procession. I received the highest rating, 58, from\r\nan experimental model Proton that was no longer in production, but I\r\nknew it was rating everybody higher and I was pretty gloomy.\r\n\r\nImagine my surprise when my name was called out as one of the possible\r\nchoices. I went into the broker\'s office and was told the Proton would\r\nselect me if I would get rid of all but ten years of my Thunderflash\r\ncontract. That meant I had to find someone to take my car and 27 years\r\nof my contract, since I had been paying for three years of the 40. The\r\nprice of the Proton, the broker told me, was scaled down to a 30-year\r\ncontract because it was an off-model.\r\n\r\nBut who would take my heap with a 27-year contract attached to it? The\r\nbroker said Grinning Gregory might go for five years, just out of the\r\ngoodness of his big, big, big heart. I wouldn\'t get that kind of a deal\r\nanywhere else, the broker said.\r\n\r\nMaybe I wouldn\'t, but that didn\'t do me much good. I needed someone to\r\ntake 27 years.\r\n\r\nHarry! Why didn\'t I think of Harry before? He didn\'t have a car yet.\r\nSkinflint Harry didn\'t want to sign the standard 40-year contract for a\r\ncar and he had been shopping around for second-hand cars. Besides, good\r\nold Harry knew how crazy I was about Jenny. He had even taken her out a\r\ncouple of times.\r\n\r\nI gave Harry an ache on the telephone and told him I\'d be right over.\r\nThen I ached the garage and the mechanic told me he could get my\r\nThunderflash in pretty good running condition again, even though he\r\ncouldn\'t promise anything permanent. I caught a helibus to my friend\'s\r\napartment.\r\n\r\n"Harry, old pal, I\'ve got the chance of a lifetime for both of us."\r\n\r\nHarry eyed me suspiciously. "How\'s that?" 

he asked.\r\n\r\n"Well, here\'s the deal. You know my real fine Thunderflash? You said\r\nit was a sharp car. It is. It\'s a first class car. But ever since that\r\nslight accident, I\'ve had just a wee bit of trouble with it. Not much,\r\nyou understand, but it\'s niggling enough to annoy my girl, Jenny. You\r\nremember Jenny, the girl you used to go with before I cut you out? Ha!\r\nHa! Anyhow, Jenny wants me to get another car. A newer one.

"\r\n\r\n"But how can you?" Harry asked. "You already have one."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just it, old buddy," I replied. "Grinning Gregory has one of\r\nthose experimental model Protons. It\'s a beauty, shimmering orange with\r\npurple wheels and bearskin upholstery. 

You\'d love it. They\'ll let me\r\nhave it on a 30-year contract if I can sell 27 years of my Thunderflash\r\ncontract. So here\'s what I\'m going to do for you, pal. I\'ll keep ten\r\nyears of the contract and let you have the Thunderflash for the rest.\r\nYou\'ll be getting a three-year-old car with 13 years of the contract\r\ntaken care of. Now is that a deal or is that a deal!"\r\n\r\nHarry wasn\'t convinced. "What\'s wrong with your car?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, hardly anything."\r\n\r\n"What\'s hardly anything?"\r\n\r\n"Not even worth mentioning."\r\n\r\n"What\'s not worth mentioning?"\r\n\r\n"To tell the truth, the frame is just the least trifle out of line and\r\nevery once in a great while it makes the rear wheel twist sideways."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said Harry.\r\n\r\n"Good old cautious, hard-headed Harry," I told him. "You are getting\r\nthe deal of a lifetime and doing a good, loyal friend a big favor\r\nbesides."\r\n\r\n"I still don\'t know, Arnold," said Harry.\r\n\r\n"All right. When will you know?"\r\n\r\n"Let me sleep on it tonight."\r\n\r\n"OK, Harry."\r\n\r\nI went home in high spirits. I knew Harry would come through for me and\r\ntake that wreck off my hands. He always was a man with an eye out for a\r\ndeal.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI slept late the next morning, but by afternoon I was over to the used\r\npeople lot to tell them to hold the Proton for me for another day.\r\nInstead, they tapped me over the head with the news that someone came\r\nin that morning and bought it. And they didn\'t have another one like it\r\nthat would accept me.\r\n\r\nAnother hope gone astray! I caught a helibus to the garage and picked\r\nup my Thunderflash after paying a whopping repair bill. I drove to\r\nJenny\'s house to convince her it was just as good as new.\r\n\r\nJenny\'s mother met me at the door.\r\n\r\n"Hello, Arnold," she said with the big smile of greeting she always\r\ngave me. "I\'m glad to see you and I hope you\'ll keep dropping over to\r\nsee me, but Jenny isn\'t here any more."\r\n\r\n"Not here?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid not."\r\n\r\n"Where is she?"\r\n\r\n"She eloped less than an hour ago. You remember the boy she used to\r\ngo with, Harry? 

He came by in a beautiful new car. It was shimmering\r\norange with purple wheels and bearskin upholstery and...."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


Manners."\r\n\r\n"Now it\'s perfectly natural, darling, that the boy should notice and be\r\nexcited. Yes, Son, the Martian\'s not so very different from us."\r\n\r\n"Oh, certainly," the Professor\'s Wife said with a trace of bitterness.\r\n"I don\'t imagine his turquoise complexion will cause any comment at all\r\nwhen you bring him to a faculty reception. They\'ll just figure he\'s had\r\na hard night--and that he got that baby-elephant nose sniffing around\r\nfor assistant professorships."\r\n\r\n"Really, darling! He probably thinks of our noses as disagreeably\r\namputated and paralyzed."\r\n\r\n"Well, anyway, Pop, he\'s in the bathroom. I followed him when he\r\nsquiggled upstairs."\r\n\r\n"Now, Son, you shouldn\'t have done that. He\'s on a strange planet and it\r\nmight make him nervous if he thought he was being spied on. We must show\r\nhim every courtesy. 

By George, I can\'t wait to discuss these things with\r\nAckerly-Ramsbottom! When I think of how much more this encounter has to\r\ngive the anthropologist than even the physicist or astronomer ..."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHe was still going strong on his second rhapsody when he was interrupted\r\nby another high-speed entrance. It was the Professor\'s Coltish Daughter.\r\n\r\n"Mom, Pop, the Martian\'s--"\r\n\r\n"Hush, dear. We know."\r\n\r\nThe Professor\'s Coltish Daughter regained her adolescent poise, which\r\nwas considerable. "Well, he\'s still in there," she said. "I just tried\r\nthe door and it was locked."\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad it was!" the Professor said while his wife added, "Yes, you\r\ncan\'t be sure what--" and caught herself. "Really, dear, that was very\r\nbad manners."\r\n\r\n"I thought he\'d come downstairs long ago," her daughter explained. "He\'s\r\nbeen in there an awfully long time. It must have been a half hour ago\r\nthat I saw him gyre and gimbal upstairs in that real gone way he has,\r\nwith Nosy here following him." The Professor\'s Coltish Daughter was\r\ncurrently soaking up both jive and _Alice_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the Professor checked his wristwatch, his expression grew troubled.\r\n"By George, he is taking his time! Though, of course, we don\'t know how\r\nmuch time Martians ... I wonder."\r\n\r\n"I listened for a while, Pop," his son volunteered. 

"He was running the\r\nwater a lot."\r\n\r\n"Running the water, eh? We know Mars is a water-starved planet. I\r\nsuppose that in the presence of unlimited water, he might be seized by a\r\nkind of madness and ... But he seemed so well adjusted."\r\n\r\nThen his wife spoke, voicing all their thoughts. Her outlook on life\r\ngave her a naturally sepulchral voice.\r\n\r\n"_What\'s he doing in there?_"\r\n\r\nTwenty minutes and at least as many fantastic suggestions later, the\r\nProfessor glanced again at his watch and nerved himself for action.\r\nMotioning his family aside, he mounted the stairs and tiptoed down the\r\nhall.\r\n\r\nHe paused only once to shake his head and mutter under his breath, "By\r\nGeorge, I wish I had Fenchurch or von Gottschalk here. They\'re a shade\r\nbetter than I am on intercultural contracts, especially taboo-breakings\r\nand affronts ..."\r\n\r\nHis family followed him at a short distance.\r\n\r\nThe Professor stopped in front of the bathroom door. Everything was\r\nquiet as death.\r\n\r\nHe listened for a minute and then rapped measuredly, steadying his hand\r\nby clutching its wrist with the other. There was a faint splashing, but\r\nno other sound.\r\n\r\nAnother minute passed. The Professor rapped again. Now there was no\r\nresponse at all. He very gingerly tried the knob. The door was still\r\nlocked.\r\n\r\nWhen they had retreated to the stairs, it was the Professor\'s Wife who\r\nonce more voiced their thoughts. This time her voice carried overtones\r\nof supernatural horror.\r\n\r\n"_What\'s he doing in there?_"\r\n\r\n"He may be dead or dying," the Professor\'s Coltish Daughter suggested\r\nbriskly. "Maybe we ought to call the Fire Department, like they did for\r\nold Mrs. Frisbee."\r\n\r\nThe Professor winced. "I\'m afraid you haven\'t visualized the\r\ncomplications, dear," he said gently. "No one but ourselves knows that\r\nthe Martian is on Earth, or has even the slightest inkling that\r\ninterplanetary travel has been achieved. Whatever we do, it will have to\r\nbe on our own. 

But to break in on a creature engaged in--well, we don\'t\r\nknow what primal private activity--is against all anthropological\r\npractice. Still--"\r\n\r\n"Dying\'s a primal activity," his daughter said crisply.\r\n\r\n"So\'s ritual bathing before mass murder," his wife added.\r\n\r\n"Please! Still, as I was about to say, we do have the moral duty to\r\nsuccor him if, as you all too reasonably suggest, he has been\r\nincapacitated by a germ or virus or, more likely, by some simple\r\nenvironmental factor such as Earth\'s greater gravity."\r\n\r\n"Tell you what, Pop--I can look in the bathroom window and see what he\'s\r\ndoing. 

All I have to do is crawl out my bedroom window and along the\r\ngutter a little ways. 

It\'s safe as houses."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Professor\'s question beginning with, "Son, how do you know--" died\r\nunuttered and he refused to notice the words his daughter was voicing\r\nsilently at her brother. He glanced at his wife\'s sardonically composed\r\nface, thought once more of the Fire Department and of other and larger\r\nand even more jealous--or would it be skeptical?--government agencies,\r\nand clutched at the straw offered him.\r\n\r\nTen minutes later, he was quite unnecessarily assisting his son back\r\nthrough the bedroom window.\r\n\r\n"Gee, Pop, I couldn\'t see a sign of him. That\'s why I took so long. 

Hey,\r\nPop, don\'t look so scared. He\'s in there, sure enough. It\'s just that\r\nthe bathtub\'s under the window and you have to get real close up to see\r\ninto it."\r\n\r\n"The Martian\'s taking a bath?"\r\n\r\n"Yep. Got it full up and just the end of his little old schnozzle\r\nsticking out. Your suit, Pop, was hanging on the door."\r\n\r\nThe one word the Professor\'s Wife spoke was like a death knell.\r\n\r\n"_Drowned!_"\r\n\r\n"No, Ma, I don\'t think so. His schnozzle was opening and closing regular\r\nlike."\r\n\r\n"Maybe he\'s a shape-changer," the Professor\'s Coltish Daughter said in a\r\nburst of evil fantasy. "Maybe he softens in water and thins out after a\r\nwhile until he\'s like an eel and then he\'ll go exploring through the\r\nsewer pipes. Wouldn\'t it be funny if he went under the street and\r\nknocked on the stopper from underneath and crawled into the bathtub with\r\nPresident Rexford, or Mrs. President Rexford, or maybe right into the\r\nmiddle of one of Janey Rexford\'s Oh-I\'m-so-sexy bubble baths?"\r\n\r\n"Please!" The Professor put his hand to his eyebrows and kept it there,\r\ncuddling the elbow in his other hand.\r\n\r\n"Well, have you thought of something?" the Professor\'s Wife asked him\r\nafter a bit. "What are you going to do?"\r\n\r\nThe Professor dropped his hand and blinked his eyes hard and took a deep\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\n"Telegraph Fenchurch and Ackerly-Ramsbottom and then break in," he said\r\nin a resigned voice, into which, nevertheless, a note of hope seemed\r\nalso to have come. "First, however, I\'m going to wait until morning."\r\n\r\nAnd he sat down cross-legged in the hall a few yards from the bathroom\r\ndoor and folded his arms.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo the long vigil commenced.\r\n\r\nThe Professor\'s family shared it and he offered no objection. Other and\r\nsterner men, he told himself, might claim to be able successfully to\r\norder their children to go to bed when there was a Martian locked in the\r\nbathroom, but he would like to see them faced with the situation.\r\n\r\nFinally dawn began to seep from the bedrooms. When the bulb in the hall\r\nhad grown quite dim, the Professor unfolded his arms.\r\n\r\nJust then, there was a loud splashing in the bathroom. The Professor\'s\r\nfamily looked toward the door. The splashing stopped and they heard the\r\nMartian moving around. Then the door opened and the Martian appeared in\r\nthe Professor\'s gray pin-stripe suit. His mouth curled sharply downward\r\nin a broad alien smile as he saw the Professor.\r\n\r\n"Good morning!" the Martian said happily. "I never slept better in my\r\nlife, even in my own little wet bed back on Mars."\r\n\r\nHe looked around more closely and his mouth straightened. "But where did\r\nyou all sleep?" he asked. "Don\'t tell me you stayed dry all night! You\r\n_didn\'t_ give up your only bed to me?"\r\n\r\nHis mouth curled upward in misery. "Oh, dear," he said, "I\'m afraid I\'ve\r\nmade a mistake somehow. 

Yet I don\'t understand how. Before I studied\r\nyou, I didn\'t know what your sleeping habits would be, but that question\r\nwas answered for me--in fact, it looked so reassuringly homelike--when I\r\nsaw those brief TV scenes of your females ready for sleep in their\r\nlittle tubs. Of course, on Mars, only the fortunate can always be sure\r\nof sleeping wet, but here, with your abundance of water, I thought there\r\nwould be wet beds for all."\r\n\r\nHe paused. "It\'s true I had some doubts last night, wondering if I\'d\r\nused the right words and all, but then when you rapped \'Good night\' to\r\nme, I splashed the sentiment back at you and went to sleep in a wink.\r\nBut I\'m afraid that somewhere I\'ve blundered and--"\r\n\r\n"No, no, dear chap," the Professor managed to say. He had been waving\r\nhis hand in a gentle circle for some time in token that he wanted to\r\ninterrupt. 

"Everything is quite all right. 

It\'s true we stayed up all\r\nnight, but please consider that as a watch--an honor guard, by\r\nGeorge!--which we kept to indicate our esteem."\r\n\r\n                                                        --FRITZ LEIBER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Galaxy Science Fiction_ December 1957.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

It was all like a\r\nmasquerade, with odd costumes and funny masks.\r\n\r\nI know that the masks are their faces, but I argue with them and find I\r\nthink as if I am arguing with humans behind the masks. They are people.\r\nI recognize people and whether I am going to like this person or that\r\nperson by something in the way they move and how they get excited when\r\nthey talk; and I know that I like these people in a motherly sort of\r\nway. You have to feel motherly toward them, I guess.\r\n\r\nThey all remind me of Ronny, a medical student I knew once. He was small\r\nand round and eager. 

You had to like him, but you couldn\'t take him very\r\nseriously. He was a pacifist; he wrote poetry and pulled it out to read\r\naloud at ill-timed moments; and he stuttered when he talked too fast.\r\n\r\nThey are like that, all fright and gentleness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI am not the only survivor--they have explained that--but I am the first\r\nthey found, and the least damaged, the one they have chosen to represent\r\nthe human race to them. They stand around my bed and answer questions,\r\nand are nice to me when I argue with them.\r\n\r\nAll in a group they look half-way between a delegation of nations and an\r\nark, one of each, big and small, thick and thin, four arms or wings, all\r\nshapes and colors in fur and skin and feathers.\r\n\r\nI can picture them in their UN of the Universe, making speeches in their\r\ndifferent languages, listening patiently without understanding each\r\nother\'s different problems, boring each other and being too polite to\r\nyawn.\r\n\r\nThey are polite, so polite I almost feel they are afraid of me, and I\r\nwant to reassure them.\r\n\r\nBut I talk as if I were angry. I can\'t help it, because if things had\r\nonly been a little different ... "Why couldn\'t you have come sooner? 

Why\r\ncouldn\'t you have tried to stop it before it happened, or at least come\r\nsooner, afterward...?"\r\n\r\nIf they had come sooner to where the workers of the Nevada power pile\r\nstarved slowly behind their protecting walls of lead--if they had looked\r\nsooner for survivors of the dust with which the nations of the world had\r\nslain each other--George Craig would be alive. He died before they came.\r\nHe was my co-worker, and I loved him.\r\n\r\nWe had gone down together, passing door by door the automatic safeguards\r\nof the plant, which were supposed to protect the people on the outside\r\nfrom the radioactive danger from the inside--but the danger of a failure\r\nof politics was far more real than the danger of failure in the science\r\nof the power pile, and that had not been calculated by the builders. We\r\nwere far underground when the first radioactivity in the air outside had\r\nshut all the heavy, lead-shielded automatic doors between us and the\r\noutside.\r\n\r\nWe were safe. And we starved there.\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t you come sooner?" I wonder if they know or guess how I feel.\r\nMy questions are not questions, but I have to ask them. He is dead. I\r\ndon\'t mean to reproach them--they look well meaning and kindly--but I\r\nfeel as if, somehow, knowing why it happened could make it stop, could\r\nlet me turn the clock back and make it happen differently. If I could\r\nhave signaled them, so they would have come just a little sooner.\r\n\r\nThey look at one another, turning their funny-face heads uneasily,\r\nmoving back and forth, but no one will answer.\r\n\r\nThe world is dead.... George is dead, that thin, pathetic creature with\r\nthe bones showing through his skin that he was when we sat still at the\r\nlast with our hands touching, thinking there were people outside who had\r\nforgotten us, hoping they would remember. We didn\'t guess that the world\r\nwas dead, blanketed in radiating dust outside. Politics had killed it.\r\n\r\nThese beings around me, they had been watching, seeing what was going to\r\nhappen to our world, listening to our radios from their small\r\nsettlements on the other planets of the Solar System. They had seen the\r\ndoom of war coming. They represented stellar civilizations of great\r\npower and technology, and with populations that would have made ours\r\nseem a small village; they were stronger than we were, and yet they had\r\ndone nothing.\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t you stop us? You could have stopped us."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA rabbity one who is closer than the others backs away, gesturing\r\npolitely that he is giving room for someone else to speak, but he looks\r\nguilty and will not look at me with his big round eyes. I still feel\r\nweak and dizzy. It is hard to think, but I feel as if they are hiding a\r\nsecret.\r\n\r\nA doelike one hesitates and comes closer to my bed. "We discussed it ...\r\nwe voted...." It talks through a microphone in its helmet with a soft\r\nlisping accent that I think comes from the shape of its mouth. It has a\r\nmuzzle and very soft, dainty, long nibbling lips like a deer that\r\nnibbles on twigs and buds.\r\n\r\n"We were afraid," adds one who looks like a bear.\r\n\r\n"To us the future was very terrible," says one who looks as if it\r\nmight have descended from some sort of large bird like a penguin. "So\r\nmuch-- Your weapons were very terrible."\r\n\r\nNow they all talk at once, crowding about my bed, apologizing. "So much\r\nkilling. 

It hurt to know about. But your people didn\'t seem to mind.

"\r\n\r\n"We were afraid."\r\n\r\n"And in your fiction," the doelike one lisped, "I saw plays from your\r\namusement machines which said that the discovery of beings in space\r\nwould save you from war, not because you would let us bring friendship\r\nand teach peace, but because the human race would unite in _hatred_ of\r\nthe outsiders. They would forget their hatred of each other only in a\r\nnew and more terrible war with us." Its voice breaks in a squeak and it\r\nturns its face away from me.\r\n\r\n"You were about to come out into space. We were wondering how to hide!"\r\nThat is a quick-talking one, as small as a child. He looks as if he\r\nmight have descended from a bat--gray silken fur on his pointed face,\r\nbig night-seeing eyes, and big sensitive ears, with a humped shape on\r\nthe back of his air suit which might be folded wings. "We were trying to\r\nconceal where we had built, so that humans would not guess we were near\r\nand look for us."\r\n\r\nThey are ashamed of their fear, for because of it they broke all the\r\nkindly laws of their civilizations, restrained all the pity and\r\ngentleness I see in them, and let us destroy ourselves.\r\n\r\nI am beginning to feel more awake and to see more clearly. And I am\r\nbeginning to feel sorry for them, for I can see why they are afraid.\r\n\r\nThey are herbivores. I remember the meaning of shapes. In the paths\r\nof evolution there are grass eaters and berry eaters and root diggers.\r\nEach has its functional shape of face and neck--and its wide,\r\nstartled-looking eyes to see and run away from the hunters. In all their\r\nracial history they have never killed to eat. They have been killed and\r\neaten, or run away, and they evolved to intelligence by selection. Those\r\nlived who succeeded in running away from carnivores like lions, hawks,\r\nand men.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI look up, and they turn their eyes and heads in quick embarrassed\r\nmotion, not meeting my eye. The rabbity one is nearest and I reach out\r\nto touch him, pleased because I am growing strong enough now to move my\r\narms. He looks at me and I ask the question: "Are there any\r\ncarnivores--flesh eaters--among you?"\r\n\r\nHe hesitates, moving his lips as if searching for tactful words. "We\r\nhave never found any that were civilized. We have frequently found them\r\nin caves and tents fighting each other. 

Sometimes we find them fighting\r\neach other with the ruins of cities around them, but they are always\r\nsavages."\r\n\r\nThe bearlike one said heavily, "It might be that carnivores evolve more\r\nrapidly and tend toward intelligence more often, for we find radioactive\r\nplanets without life, and places like the place you call your asteroid\r\nbelt, where a planet should be--but there are only scattered fragments\r\nof planet, pieces that look as if a planet had been blown apart. We\r\nthink that usually ..." He looked at me uncertainly, beginning to\r\nfumble his words. "We think ..."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"Yours is the only carnivorous race we have found that was--civilized,\r\nthat had a science and was going to come out into space," the doelike\r\none interrupted softly. "We were afraid."\r\n\r\nThey seem to be apologizing.\r\n\r\nThe rabbity one, who seems to be chosen as the leader in speaking to me,\r\nsays, "We will give you anything you want. Anything we are able to give\r\nyou.

"\r\n\r\nThey mean it. We survivors will be privileged people, with a key to all\r\nthe cities, everything free. Their sincerity is wonderful, but puzzling.\r\nAre they trying to atone for the thing they feel was a crime; that they\r\nallowed humanity to murder itself, and lost to the Galaxy the richness\r\nof a race? Is this why they are so generous?\r\n\r\nPerhaps then they will help the race to get started again. The records\r\nare not lost. The few survivors can eventually repopulate Earth. Under\r\nthe tutelage of these peaceable races, without the stress of division\r\ninto nations, we will flower as a race. No children of mine to the\r\nfurthest descendant will ever make war again. This much of a lesson we\r\nhave learned.\r\n\r\nThese timid beings do not realize how much humanity has wanted peace.\r\nThey do not know how reluctantly we were forced and trapped by old\r\ninstitutions and warped tangles of politics to which we could see no\r\nanswer. We are not naturally savage. We are not savage when approached\r\nas individuals. Perhaps they know this, but are afraid anyhow,\r\ninstinctive fear rising up from the blood of their hunted, frightened\r\nforebears.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe human race will be a good partner to these races. Even recovering\r\nfrom starvation as I am, I can feel in myself an energy they do not\r\nhave. The savage in me and my race is a creative thing, for in those who\r\nhave been educated as I was it is a controlled savagery which attacks\r\nand destroys only problems and obstacles, never people. Any human raised\r\noutside of the political traditions that the race inherited from its\r\nbloodstained childhood would be as friendly and ready for friendship as\r\nI am toward these beings. I could never hurt these pleasant, overgrown\r\nbunnies and squirrels.\r\n\r\n"We will do everything we can to make up for ... we will try to help,"\r\nsays the bunny, stumbling over the English, but civilized and cordial\r\nand kind.\r\n\r\nI sit up suddenly, reaching out impulsively to shake his hand. Suddenly\r\nfrightened he leaps back. 

All of them step back, glancing behind them as\r\nthough making sure of the avenue of escape. Their big luminous eyes\r\nwiden and glance rapidly from me to the doors, frightened.\r\n\r\nThey must think I am about to leap out of bed and pounce on them and eat\r\nthem. I am about to laugh and reassure them, about to say that all I\r\nwant from them is friendship, when I feel a twinge in my abdomen from\r\nthe sudden motion. I touch it with one hand under the bedclothes.\r\n\r\nThere is the scar of an incision there, almost healed. 

An operation.

There will be no\r\nmore humans after we die.\r\n\r\nI am frozen, one hand still extended to grasp the hand of the rabbity\r\none, my eyes still searching his expression, reassuring words still half\r\nformed.\r\n\r\nThere will be time for anger or grief later, for now, in this instant, I\r\ncan understand.

We knew he\'d been close, but not _how_ close.\r\n\r\nMy nickname\'s Monk. I\'ve fought it, certainly, but what can you do\r\nwhen a well-wishing mother names you after a wealthy uncle and your\r\nbirth certificate says Neander Thalberg? As early as high school some\r\nbright pundit noted the name\'s similarity to that of a certain\r\nprehistoric man. Unfortunately the similarity is not in name alone:\r\nI\'m muscular, stooped, and, I must admit, not handsome hero model\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nWell, maybe the nickname\'s justified, but still, Al Benson didn\'t have\r\nto give the crowning insult. And yet, if he hadn\'t, there probably\r\nwouldn\'t be a torchship stern-ending on Mars just about now.\r\n\r\nC. 

I. (Central Intelligence, that is) at the Sands figured Benson\r\nwould head for New York. Which is why the boss sent me here. I\r\nregistered in a hotel in the 50\'s and, figuring that whatever Benson\r\nintended to do would have spectacular results, I kept the stereo on\r\nNews.\r\n\r\nBenson\'s wife hadn\'t yielded much info. Sure she described the clothes\r\nhe was wearing and said he\'d taken nothing else except an artist\'s\r\ncase. What was in that was anybody\'s guess; his private lab is such a\r\njumble nobody could tell what, if anything, was missing.\r\n\r\nC. I. knew his political feelings. Seems he\'d been talking wild about\r\nthe upcoming presidential election and had sworn he\'d nip the\r\ndraft-Cadigan movement in the bud. Cadigan\'s Mayor of New York City.\r\nHe\'s anti-space. In fact, Cadigan\'s anti just about everything in\r\nscience except intercontinental missiles. Strictly for defense, of\r\ncourse. Cadigan says.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA weathercaster was making rash promises on the stereo when the potray\r\ndinged. The potray? I certainly wasn\'t expecting mail. Only C. I. knew\r\nwhere I was and they\'d have closed-circuited me on visio if they\r\nwanted contact.\r\n\r\nThe potray dinged and there was a package in it.\r\n\r\nNow matter transference I knew. It put mailmen out of business.\r\nThere\'s a potray in every domicile and you can put things in it, dial\r\nthe destination and they come out there. They come out the same size\r\nand weight and in the same condition as they went in, provided they\r\ndidn\'t go in alive. Life loses, as many a shade of a hopeful guinea\r\npig could relate.\r\n\r\nSo the potray dinged and here was this package. At first glance it\r\nlooked like one of those cereal samples manufacturers have been\r\neverlastingly sending through since postal rates dropped after cost of\r\nthe potrays had been amortized. But cereal samples don\'t come through\r\nat midday; they\'re night traffic stuff.\r\n\r\nThe package was light, its wrapping curiously smooth. There was an\r\nenvelope attached with my correct name and potray number. Whoever had\r\nmailed it must be in C. I. or must know someone in C. I. who knew\r\nwhere I was.\r\n\r\nThe postmark was blurred but I could make out that it had been cast\r\nfrom Grand Central. Time didn\'t matter. It couldn\'t have been cast\r\nmore than a microsecond earlier.\r\n\r\nThe envelope contained a card upon which was typed:\r\n\r\n"Caution! Site on cylinder of 2 ft. 

radius and 6 ft. 

height. Unwrap at\r\narmslength."\r\n\r\nNow what? A practical joke? If so, it must be Benson\'s work. He\'s\r\nplayed plenty, from pumping hydrogen sulphide (that\'s rotten egg gas,\r\nas you know) into the air-conditioning system at high school to\r\ncalling a gynecologist to the launching stage at the Sands to sever an\r\numbilical cord which he neglected to say was on a Viking rocket.\r\n\r\nI followed the instructions. As I bent back the first fold of the\r\nstrange wrapping it came alive, unfolding itself with incredible\r\nswiftness.\r\n\r\nSomething burst forth like a freed djinn--almost instantaneously\r\nlengthening, spreading--a thing with beetling brows, low, broad\r\nforehead, prognathous jaw, and a hunched, brutally muscular body, with\r\na great club over its swollen shoulder.\r\n\r\nI went precipitously backward over a coffee table.\r\n\r\nIt stabilized, a dead mockery, replica of a Neanderthal.\r\n\r\nA placard hung on its chest. I read this:\r\n\r\n"Even some of the early huntsmen weren\'t successful. Abandon the\r\nchase, Monk. 

I\'ve things to do and this--your blood brother, no\r\ndoubt--couldn\'t catch me any more than you can!"\r\n\r\nWhich positively infuriated me.\r\n\r\nDo you blame me?\r\n\r\nA few cussing, cussed minutes later I realized what Al Benson had\r\napparently done: solved the torchship\'s fuel problem.\r\n\r\nOh, I\'d seen Klein bottles and Mobius strips and other things that\r\ntwist in on themselves and into other dimensions, twisting into\r\nmicrocosms and macrocosms--into elsewhere, in any event. And here I\r\nhad visual evidence that Benson had had something nearly six feet tall\r\nand certainly two feet in breadth enclosed in a nearly weightless\r\ncarton less than eight inches on the side!\r\n\r\nSufficient fuel for a Marstrip? Just wrap it up!\r\n\r\nThe stereo\'s audio was saying: "... from the Museum of Natural\r\nHistory. Curators are compiling a list of the missing exhibits which\r\nwe will reveal to you on this channel as soon as it\'s available. Now\r\nwe switch to Dick Joy at City Hall with news of the latest exhibit\r\nfound. Come in, Dick!"\r\n\r\nOn the steps of City Hall was a full size replica of a mastodon over\r\nwhose massive back was draped a banner bearing the slogan: "The\r\nUniversal Party is for you! Don\'t return to prehistory with Cadigan!\r\nRe-elect President Ollie James and go to the stars!"\r\n\r\nAnd there was a closeup of Mayor Cadigan standing pompous and\r\nwrathful--and looking very diminutive--behind the emblem of his\r\nopposition party.\r\n\r\nDick Joy was saying, "Eyewitnesses claim that this replica--obviously\r\none of the items stolen from the Museum of Natural History--suddenly\r\nmaterialized here. Immediately prior to the alleged materialization a\r\nman--whose photograph we show now--ostensibly bent down to tie a\r\nshoelace, setting a shoebox beside him. He left the box, walking off\r\ninto the gathering crowd, and this mastodon _seemed_ to spring into\r\nbeing where the shoebox had been.\r\n\r\n"The mastodon replica has been examined. A report just handed me says\r\nit is definitely that from the Museum and that it could not\r\nconceivably have been contained in a shoebox. It\'s obviously a case of\r\nmass hypnotism. The replica must have been trucked here. There\'s no\r\nother possible explanation. 

Excuse me!"\r\n\r\nDick Joy turned away, then back.\r\n\r\n"I have just been handed a notice that Mayor Cadigan wishes to say a\r\nfew words and I hereby introduce him, His Honor the Mayor, Joseph F.\r\nCadigan!"\r\n\r\nHis balding, fragmentarily curly-haired Honor glared.\r\n\r\n"Friends," he said chokingly, "whatever madman is responsible for this\r\noutrageous act will not go unpunished. I call upon the City\'s Finest\r\nto track him down and bring him to justice.\r\n\r\n"I am for justice, for equality and peace. I--"\r\n\r\nHis Honor was apparently determined to use all the time he could.\r\nBeing a newscast, it was for free.\r\n\r\nI killed the stereo. And the visio rang. It was Phil Pollini, the C.\r\nI. Chief.\r\n\r\n"Monk," he said, "guess you\'ve seen the stereo. Al\'s out to fix the\r\nMayor\'s wagon."\r\n\r\n"Say that again," I said, having a brainstorm.\r\n\r\n"Now, look--" he started.\r\n\r\n"Maybe you\'ve got something there, Chief," I cut in. "Cadigan\'s got\r\nthe superduper of all wagons--a seven passenger luxury limousine with\r\nbulletproof glass, stereo, a bar, venetian blinds and heaven knows\r\nwhat else. Hot and cold running androids, maybe. 

He prowls the\r\nelevated highways with an \'In Conference\' sign flashing over the\r\nwindshield. So\'s he can\'t be wire-tapped or miked, I guess. It\'d be a\r\nnatch for Al Benson to go for."\r\n\r\nPollini grinned.\r\n\r\n"So if you were Benson what\'d you do to fix the Mayor\'s wagon?"\r\n\r\n"Hitch it to a star," I said, "and the closest spot to a star would be\r\nthe observation platform of the Greater Empire State."\r\n\r\n"You\'re probably right," the Chief said. "Get going!"\r\n\r\nI got.\r\n\r\nTen minutes later I walked out onto the observation platform on the\r\n150th floor of the Greater Empire State Building--and found an\r\nincredulous crowd gathered around the mayor\'s limousine. I felt good.\r\nI\'d predicted.\r\n\r\nI asked a guard, "How\'d it get here?"\r\n\r\nHis eyebrows were threatening a back somersault.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t know," he said. "I was looking over the side; then turned\r\naround and here it was! 

You have any ideas?"\r\n\r\nWhich is when I spotted Al Benson.\r\n\r\nI settled for shoving Benson toward the elevator, being careful since\r\nhe had a box under each arm. We made the elevator and went down and it\r\nstopped on the 120th floor and the operator said, "Change here for all\r\nlower floors and the street--"\r\n\r\nAs we waited on the 120th for the down elevator, the P. A. system\r\nbarked:\r\n\r\n"Attention all building occupants. By order of the Mayor no one will\r\nbe permitted to leave the building until further notice. Please remain\r\nwhere you are. 

We will try not to inconvenience you for any great\r\ntime."\r\n\r\nThere was no one close to us.\r\n\r\n"Al," I said, "look, stinker, you\'ve had your fun but this is it. I\r\ndon\'t know what you\'ve got in those boxes but you\'ve got to turn them\r\nover--and yourself--to the next copper who shows. This is a civil\r\nmatter, strictly local, and not C. I.

"\r\n\r\nBenson grinned. "Got to make a delivery first, Monk. Look, there\'s a\r\npotray over there. Can I use it?"\r\n\r\nHis grin was infectious. 

"So what are you going to send where?" I\r\nasked as sternly as I could.\r\n\r\n"The Mayor\'s personal files," he said. "I managed to carry them out of\r\nCity Hall--once they\'d been suitably wrapped, of course! I\'m sending\r\nthem to the Senate Investigation Committee. Don\'t worry, Monk, His\r\nHonor won\'t be President this or any year!"\r\n\r\nI helped him dial the SIC number.\r\n\r\n"What about the other package?" I asked him then.\r\n\r\n"Insurance," he said. "Come out on the setback."\r\n\r\nHe placed the last package on the mosaic tile of the terrace, untied\r\nits string, flipped open the edge of the Benson wrapping and jumped\r\nback.\r\n\r\nIt was an NYC police helicopter.\r\n\r\nWe potrayed it back from the Sands. Suitably wrapped, of course.\r\n\r\nThat was a month ago. Most of it never came out in the papers. Nothing\r\nof Benson\'s invention. C. I. thought it should be squelched, at least\r\nuntil Benson and the boys get back from Mars.\r\n\r\nWhich would be the end except for the packages. Yes, Benson left a\r\ngross of them with me and I\'ve been mailing them one a day to the\r\nleaders of the opposition party. I don\'t truly know what\'s in them, of\r\ncourse. But it\'s very curious that the day before the torchship left\r\nexactly one hundred and forty-four cylinders of hydrogen sulphide were\r\nmissing from quartermaster stores. Coincidentally one of my C. I.\r\nfriends tells me Benson had him rig up a gross of automatic releases\r\nfor gas cylinders.\r\n\r\nAdding it up, it could be a good lesson for politicians to keep their\r\nnoses out of science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s Political Application, by John Victor Peterson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n


"What are you doing in here? You know it\'s\r\na Federal Offense for anybody to come into this room without I say so?"\r\n\r\n"Momma and Hilda come in all the time, and you don\'t say so." 

Oley stood\r\nfirm on what he figured were legal grounds. "What makes shorts?

"\r\n\r\nSven relented a little. This brother had been something of a surprise to\r\nhim, coming along when Sven was a full ten years old. But, he reflected,\r\nafter a few years maybe I should get used to the idea. Actually, he sort\r\nof liked the youngster.\r\n\r\n"Shorts," he said, speaking from the superior eminence of his fourteen\r\nyears to the four-year-old, "is when electricity finds a way to get back\r\nwhere it came from without doing a lot of hard work getting there. But\r\nyou see, electricity like to work; so, even when it has an easy way, it\r\njust works harder and uses itself up."\r\n\r\nThis confused explanation of shorts was, of course, taken verbatim,\r\ndespite the fact that Oley couldn\'t define half the words and probably\r\ncouldn\'t even pronounce them.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like shorts. I don\'t like these pink shorts Momma put on me\r\nthis morning. Is they electrics, Sven?"\r\n\r\nSven glanced around at the accidentally-dyed-in-the-laundry, formerly\r\nwhite shorts.\r\n\r\n"Um-m-m. Yeah. You could call \'em electric."\r\n\r\nWith this Oley let out whoop and dashed out of the room, trailing a\r\nsmall voice behind him. "Momma, Momma. Sven says my shorts is electric!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll short Sven\'s electrics for him, if he makes fun of your shorts!"\r\nOley heard his mother\'s comforting reply.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the adult world days passed before Oley\'s accidentally acquired\r\npattern of nubilous information on the subject of shorts was enlarged.\r\nIt was only days in the adult world, but in Oley\'s world each day was a\r\nmountainous fraction of an entire lifetime, into which came tumbling and\r\njumbling--or were pulled--bits, pieces, oddments, landslides and\r\nacquisitions of information on every subject that he ran into, or that\r\nran into him. Nobody had told Oley that acquiring information was his\r\njob at the moment; the acquisition was partly accidental, mostly\r\ninstinctive, and spurred by an intense curiosity and an even more\r\nintense determination to master the world as he saw it.\r\n\r\nThere was the taste of the sick green flowers that Momma kept in the\r\nwindow box and, just for a side course, a little bit of the dirt, too.\r\nThere were the patterns of the rain on the window, and the reactions of\r\na cat to having its tail pulled. The fact that you touch a stove one\r\ntime, and it\'s cool and comfortable to lay your head against, and\r\nanother time it hurts. 

Things like that. 

And other things--towering\r\nadults who sometimes swoop down on you and throw you high into the air;\r\nand most times walk over you, around you, and ignore you completely. The\r\njumble of assorted and unsorted information that is the heritage of\r\nevery growing young inquiring brain.\r\n\r\nIn terms of time, it was only a couple of weeks, if you were looking at\r\nit as an adult, until the next "shorts" incident.\r\n\r\nOley was sitting peacefully at the breakfast table, doing his level best\r\nto control the manipulation of the huge knife-fork-and-spoon,\r\nplate-bowl-and-glass, from which he was expected to eat a meal. Things\r\nsmelled good. 

Momma was cooking doste, and that to Oley smelled best of\r\nall. The doster ticked quietly to itself, then gave a loud pop, and up\r\ncame two golden-brown slices of doste. Dostes? Oley wasn\'t sure. But he\r\nhadn\'t really begun paying too much attention to whether one doste was\r\nthe same as two doste or what, though he could quite proudly tell you\r\nthe difference between one and two.\r\n\r\nOut it came, and fresh butter was spread on it, and in went two shiny\r\nwhite beds, for some more doste.\r\n\r\nLittle Oley watched in fascination. And now he reached for the\r\ntremendous glass sitting on the table in front of him. But his fingers\r\ndidn\'t quite make it. Somehow, the glass was heavy and slippery, and it\r\neluded him, rolled over on its side, and spilled the bright purple juicy\r\ncontents out across the table in a huge swish.\r\n\r\nOley wasn\'t dismayed, but watched with a researcher\'s interest as the\r\nbright purple juice swept across the table towards the busily ticking\r\ndoster. Momma, of course, wasn\'t here, or she would have been gruff\r\nabout it. She\'d just gone into the other room.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe juice spread rapidly at first, and then more and more slowly, making\r\na huge, circuitous river spreading across the table, first towards the\r\ndoster and then away from it towards the frayed power-cord lying on the\r\ntable. It touched and began to run along the cord. Not a very eventful\r\nrecording so far, but Oley watched, charmed.\r\n\r\nAs he watched, a few bubbles began to appear near the frayed spot. A few\r\nwisps of steam. And then, suddenly, there was a loud, snarling\r\nsplat--and Momma screamed from the doorway. "That juice is making a\r\nshort!"\r\n\r\nThe information, of course, was duly recorded. Juice makes shorts.\r\n\r\nIt was a minor item of information, mixed into a jumble of others, and\r\nnothing else was added to this particular file for nearly another week.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOley was playing happily on the living room floor that night. Here there\r\nwas much to explore, though an adult might not have thought twice about\r\nit. Back in the corner behind Momma\'s doing bachine a bright, slender\r\npiece of metal caught Oley\'s attention. Bigger on one end than the\r\nother, but not really very big anywhere, the sewing machine needle\r\nproved fascinating. As a first experiment, Oley determined that it\r\nworked like a tooth by biting himself with it. After that he went around\r\nthe room, biting other things with it. Information, of course, is\r\ninformation, and to be obtained any way one can.\r\n\r\nThe brown, snaky lamp cord was the end of this experiment. Oley bit it,\r\nviciously, with his new tooth, and had only barely observed that it had\r\npenetrated completely through when there was a loud splat, and all the\r\nlights in the room went out.\r\n\r\nIn the darkness and confusion, of course, Oley moved away, seeking other\r\nnew experiences. So the cause of the short that Momma and Poppa yakked\r\nso loudly about was never attributed to Oley\'s actions, but only to "How\r\ncould a needle have gotten from your sewing machine into this lamp cord,\r\nAlice?"\r\n\r\nBut the sum of information had increased. Neatles stuck into lamp cords\r\nhad something to do with shorts.\r\n\r\nMore time passed. And this time the file on shorts was stimulated by\r\nPoppa. The big, rough, booming voice had always scared Oley a bit when\r\nit sounded mad, like now.\r\n\r\n"Alice, I\'ve just got to have some more shorts!"\r\n\r\nPoppa was rummaging in a drawer far above Oley\'s head, so he couldn\'t\r\nsee the object under discussion. But all he already knew about\r\nshorts--the information passed in review before him.\r\n\r\nShorts are useful. They help electrics to work harder.\r\n\r\nShorts you wear, and they are electrics.\r\n\r\nWires are electrics.\r\n\r\nShorts can be made by juice.\r\n\r\nShorts can be made by neatles, that bite like teeth.\r\n\r\nPoppa needs more shorts.\r\n\r\nBut Oley wasn\'t motivated to act at the moment. Just sorting out\r\ninformation and connecting it with other information files in the\r\nnecessarily haphazard manner that might eventually result in something\r\ncalled intelligence, although he didn\'t know that yet.\r\n\r\nIt was a week later in the kitchen, when Momma dropped a giant version\r\nof the neatle on the floor, that his information file in this area\r\nincreased again.\r\n\r\n"Is that a neatle?" Oley asked.\r\n\r\nHis mother laughed quietly and looked fondly at her son as she put the\r\nice pick back on the table.\r\n\r\n"I guess you could call it a needle, Oley," she told him. "An ice\r\nneedle."\r\n\r\nOley instinctively waited until Momma\'s back was turned before taking\r\nthe nice neatle to try its biting powers; and instinctively took it out\r\nof the kitchen before starting his experiments.\r\n\r\nAs he passed the cellar door he heard a soft gurgling and promptly\r\nchanged course. Pulling open the door with difficulty, he seated himself\r\non the cellar stairs to watch a delightful new spectacle--frothing,\r\ngurgling water making its way across the floor towards the stairs. It\r\nlooked wonderfully dirty and brown, and to Oley it was an absorbing\r\nphenomenon. It never occurred to him to tell Momma.\r\n\r\nSuddenly above him the cellar door slammed open, and Poppa came charging\r\ndown the stairs, narrowly missing the small figure, straight into the\r\nrising waters, intent, though Oley couldn\'t know it, on reaching the\r\ndrain pipe in the far corner of the cellar to plug it before water from\r\nthe spring rains could back up farther and really flood the cellar out.\r\n\r\nHalfway across the cellar, Poppa reached up and grasped the dangling\r\noverhead light to turn it on, in order to see his way to the drain--and\r\nsuddenly came to frozen, rigid, gasping stop as his hand clamped firmly\r\nover the socket.\r\n\r\nLittle Oley watched. There was juice in the cellar. Poppa had hold of an\r\nelectric. Was Poppa trying to make the shorts he needed?\r\n\r\nOley wasn\'t sure. He thought it probable. And from the superior\r\nknowledge of his four years, Oley already knew a better way to make\r\nshorts. Neatles make good shorts. Juice don\'t do so well.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, Oley decided to prove his point: Nice neatles probably made\r\neven better shorts than other neatles--and there was a big electric\r\nrunning up the side of the stairs--an electric fat enough to make a real\r\ngood shorts. Maybe lots of shorts.\r\n\r\nRaising his nice neatle, Oley took careful aim and plunged it through\r\nthe 220-volt stove feeder cable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOley woke up. The strange pretty lady in white was a new experience.\r\nSomebody he hadn\'t seen before. And there seemed to be something wrong\r\nwith his hand, but Oley hadn\'t noticed it very much, yet.\r\n\r\n"Well, my little Hero\'s awake! And how are you this morning? Your Momma\r\nand Poppa will be in to see you in just a minute."\r\n\r\nThe pretty lady in white went away, and Oley gazed around the white room\r\nwith its funny shape, happily recorded the experience, and dozed off\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly he was awakened again. Momma was there; and Poppa. 

And\r\nSven. But they all seemed different somehow this morning. Momma had been\r\ncrying, even though she was smiling bravely now. And Poppa seemed to\r\nhave a new softness that he\'d seldom seen before. Sven was looking\r\npuzzled.\r\n\r\n"I still say, Pop, that he\'s a genius. He _must_ have known what he was\r\ndoing."\r\n\r\n"Oley," Poppa\'s voice was husky--gruff, but kinder and softer than\r\nusual. "I want you to answer me carefully. 

But understand that it\'s all\r\nright either way. 

I just want you to tell me. Why did you put the ice\r\npick through the stove cable? You saved my life, you know. 

But I\'d like\r\nto know how you knew how."\r\n\r\nLittle Oley grinned. His world was peaceful and wonderful now. And all\r\nthe big adults were bending and leaning down and talking to him.\r\n\r\n"Nice neatle," he said. "Big electric. Poppa needed shorts."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Analog Science Fact & Fiction_ January\r\n    1964.

"Soon we come to\r\nwaterhole."\r\n\r\nI didn\'t ask him how he knew. Andromedans have a knack for geography.\r\nIn many ways, they\'re almost as good as an Earthman. "Good," was all I\r\nanswered. It was short, to the point, and showed who was boss.\r\n\r\nOnward we trekked, a sunburnt duo casting long bronze shadows across\r\nthe burning sands of K\'niik K\'naak. A thin plume of Yekkweed fumes\r\nmarked our passage. It was nearly sunset when we spotted the pink\r\nglitter of that sickening slop that is the Polaris III excuse for\r\nwater. I stood watching the sunset, while Mimp unloaded all the gear\r\nand began to set up camp. As the last rays faded in the sky, I turned\r\nand entered the pseudolog hut Mimp had inflated. Hard on his lungs, of\r\ncourse, but I hadn\'t wanted to burden him with the extra weight of a\r\nhand-pump. I\'m a stern man, but I\'m fair.\r\n\r\nHe had my slippers laid out beside the armchair by the fire and a cool\r\nmint julep awaiting me on the small teakwood taboret. He was busying\r\nhimself in the kitchenette, whipping up a quick souffle with one hand\r\nand tossing a small salad with the other.\r\n\r\n"Hurry it up there," I growled jovially. "Time is money, time is\r\nmoney!" A bit of friendly joshing is good for the relationship; shows\r\nMimp I\'m tolerant of him sharing the same quarters, without actually\r\nmaking me act like an equal, if you know what I mean.\r\n\r\n"I hurry, Sahib," said Mimp. "Coming up." 

(He always called me Sahib.)\r\nHe rushed across the room and began setting the table, with my\r\npearl-handled silverware.\r\n\r\n"No, not there," I yawned, picking up my julep and settling back into\r\nthe armchair. "I think I\'d like the table nearer the piano, so you can\r\nplay Chopin Nocturnes while I dine." I added, as a kindly afterthought,\r\n"You can reheat your share of the souffle later, after I\'ve gone to\r\nbed." Personally, I hate cold souffle.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Effendi," said Mimp. (He always called me Effendi.) Rapidly, he\r\nmoved the table over to the Steinway, set out the finished souffle\r\nand salad and then hurried to the piano and began laboriously plunking\r\nout glorious melody. I took a sip of my julep, then spat it out on the\r\ncarpet.\r\n\r\n"Mimp!" I roared, incensed. "Did you make this drink with Polaris III\r\nwater?"\r\n\r\nCraven and cowering, he fell at my feet, whining for mercy. 

But I was\r\nadamant. You let an alien take an inch, and the next thing, he\'s swiped\r\na parsec. "The knout," I said, keeping my voice emotionless and holding\r\nout my hand.\r\n\r\n"Please, Kimosabe," whimpered Mimp, "I dared not use the water in\r\nthe canteens. You know that Polaris III water is poisonous to us\r\nAndromedans, while you Earthmen can tolerate it."\r\n\r\n"I can _not_!" 

I raged.\r\n\r\n"I was speaking medically," he mewed piteously.\r\n\r\n"And I, esthetically," I snarled. "The knout, now, and be quick about\r\nit."\r\n\r\nHe scurried on all fours to the bureau where I kept my odds and ends,\r\nand came crawling back with the brutal leather whip. I weighed the\r\ninfraction, decided that three stripes should be lesson enough and I\r\nlaid them onto his bare back with a steady hand. "Now," I said, wearied\r\nby the effort, "play something gay and lilting."\r\n\r\nHastily, he dragged himself to the Steinway and complied. Dinner was\r\nreally delicious.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNext morning, before sun-up, we lay in wait for the herd behind a\r\nrock beside the waterhole. The sky was growing pale saffron near the\r\nhorizon, then light yellow, and finally glaring brass as the sun arose.\r\n(By "sun," I mean the star Polaris, of course. Our sun is a star, you\r\nknow. Or did you? 

_I_ knew, naturally.) Then, afar off, I espied the\r\nbulky blobs in the sky that were the flying tuskers of K\'niik-K\'naak.\r\nNo man had ever hunted one before. I felt pretty proud, let me tell you.\r\n\r\nOnward they came through the air, their large skin-type gray wings\r\nflapping stolidly up and down, about three strokes to the mile.\r\nEnormous creatures they were, with fiery little eyes, and long trailing\r\ntrunks that had a wicked little hook at the tip. But the thing that\r\nreally caught one\'s eye was their tusks. Ten of them. Eight originating\r\nin the mouth, and one in either fore-knee. Each tusk was seven feet\r\nin length, long, white, straight-tapered and flawless. But not ivory,\r\nnot on these babies. Pure pearl. 

That lovely lustrous calcareous\r\nconcretion! Each tusk would bring fifty thousand interplanetary credits\r\non the open market. And there were ten per elephantine beast, and at\r\nleast sixty of them in the herd.\r\n\r\n"Look at that, will you!" I cried to Mimp. "Look, feast your ugly eyes\r\non that gleaming fortune swooping down upon us, Mimp!"\r\n\r\n"I look, I feast," he murmured servilely, huddled behind me behind the\r\nrock behind the tree. Aliens tend to be cowardly when their lives are\r\nin danger.\r\n\r\nCarefully, I raised the rifle and took a bead on the youngest beast in\r\nthat descending herd. It\'s slightly illegal to shoot the fledglings,\r\nbut after all, I wasn\'t going to bring him _back_ with me, so no one\r\nwould know. It\'s just that I find that when I shoot the eldest in a\r\nherd of wildlife, the others miss their protector and flee. But if I\r\nshoot one of the babies, the elder ones stay around to protect it, and\r\nI get to kill lots more. Nasty, perhaps, but that\'s the hunting game\r\nfor you.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, I took this bead on the beast. I was just in the act of\r\ndepressing the firing stud when an unwonted lightness in the weapon\r\ncaught my attention. Irritated, I cracked open the firing chamber.\r\n"_Mimp!_" I growled, in one of my rare real wraths. "You didn\'t _load_\r\nthe ray-rifle! Even a Moxley .55 is no damned good without cartridges!"\r\n\r\n"A thousand pardons, boss," muttered Mimp, inclining his loathsome\r\nlavender face in a subservient bow. 

"I go get."\r\n\r\nHe wriggled away across the sand and into the hut, fortunately not\r\ndisturbing the herd, which was now kneeling on the slope above\r\nthe waterhole and inhaling that putrid pink liquid through their\r\ntrunks. I drooled a bit, seeing the rainbow glint of sunlight on\r\nthose magnificent tusks. Seconds passed, then minutes. The herd was\r\npractically slaked, and still no crawling Mimp reappeared from the hut.\r\n\r\nSoon they\'d fly off, and cost me a fortune.\r\n\r\nI was already pretty much in hock after paying the fare to Polaris\r\nIII from Earth. (I\'d been able to save a little by listing Mimp as\r\nbaggage, and storing him in the hold for the flight.) Angry, irked, and\r\npretty well enraged, I moved swiftly toward the hut on hands and knees,\r\nscuttling in the doorway as fast as I could, lest the herd see me and\r\nflee, or attack.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the parlor, I stood erect, and glanced about. There was no one in\r\nsight, but the back door was open. "_Mimp!_" I bellowed, stamping\r\nacross the carpet. "Where are you, you off-color blemish!?" No reply.\r\n"This means six stripes with the knout!" I warned him.\r\n\r\nThen I heard a faint sound, not unlike that of a fourteen-inch bolo\r\nknife being brought down hard upon the inflating-valve of a pseudolog\r\nhut. I felt at my belt. My bolo was missing. 

"Mimp!" I hollered, much\r\ntoo late.\r\n\r\nThen the whole damned room, piano, fireplace, carpet, armchair and all,\r\nsnapped in upon me, and I was wound up with those rubberized walls\r\ntighter than the center of a golfball. I think I must have swooned,\r\nthen.\r\n\r\nMuch, much later, by dint of tooth, fingernail and sheer grit, I\r\nhad gnawed, clawed and wrenched my way free of the collapsed hut. A\r\nstunning sight met my eyes. All about the waterhole, the flying tuskers\r\nwere still kneeling. Every one of them was dead and already beginning\r\nto rot. But the infuriating thing was that not one of them had so much\r\nas an inch of tusk any more.\r\n\r\nEvery beast had been detusked, the priceless pearl shafts lopped off\r\nflush with the thick gray hides. _Mimp!_ And with _my_ bolo knife,\r\nalready!\r\n\r\nAt least he\'d left me a canteen. I tasted it. _Pffaugh!_ Pink Polaris\r\nIII slop! The dirty little--! 

But I saved it anyhow. I had a long\r\nlonely walk back to town ahead of me.\r\n\r\nAnd there it was that I learned even worse news.\r\n\r\nMimp had already sold the tusks and was on his way back to Andromeda,\r\nwith a fortune in his breechclout. I swore revenge, then and there,\r\nbut was unable to carry it out, since I was short the rocketfare back\r\nto Earth and the authorities. (It seems that Polaris III is a neutral\r\nplanet. Even the mighty word "Earthman" carries no weight there.) So\r\nI had to hock the piano, my precious Moxley .55 and what could be\r\nsalvaged of the souffle, and even then I was only able to book passage\r\nas near Earth as Sirius II.\r\n\r\nLuckily, they had a consulate there. I was able to secure a ride home,\r\nafter some weeks\' wait. By then, however, it was too late to avenge\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nMimp, with his stolen fortune, had paid off his planet\'s debt to Earth.\r\nAndromeda IV (his home planet) declared its independence, and the\r\nEarth authorities throw up their hands and shrug whenever I hint at\r\nextraditing him. Seems he\'s the new emperor there, or something. 

They\r\ncan\'t afford to antagonize him. Damn!\r\n\r\nHowever, I suppose you\'re wondering just why I get goosebumps when I\r\nrecall the flying tuskers of K\'niik-K\'naak. Well, it wasn\'t so much the\r\ndanger from the beasts, nor the hideous heat of that desert, nor my\r\nlong, painful sojourn beneath the Steinway in the shrunken hut that was\r\nso bad.\r\n\r\nIt was those tuskers. Know how they died? Mimp had poisoned the\r\nwaterhole. Unsporting, and all that, but the thing that nags my brain\r\nis: Why didn\'t _I_ think of that?\r\n\r\nMe! Bested by a lousy purple alien!\r\n\r\nWhat\'s the universe coming to?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Main lay dying in the wreckage of the space-ship. Dying--and\r\ncursing the deadly wind of Venus. It had killed his mates. It would\r\nsoon have him.\r\n\r\nThe wind was trying to finish him off right now. It shrieked, moaned,\r\nwhispered and shouted through the smashed hull where he sprawled in his\r\nspace-suit. Laughed, too. The wind was a murderer--and was glad.\r\n\r\nAll but he were dead. Soon the grit-laden wind would bury them and\r\ntheir ship. Then all the effort, the skill, the faith--all the\r\ningenuity and labor expended on the expedition--would be wiped away, as\r\ninvisible as the wind that buried them.\r\n\r\nThinking of that, thinking back over each agonizing hour since his\r\nlanding on Venus, George Main wondered what he should have done, what\r\nhe could now do, to prevent the utter waste of their efforts and their\r\nlives.\r\n\r\nThe wind was his enemy--and the wind couldn't even be seen. Only the\r\ndust it carried was visible. 

Too visible. Dust was so thick in the\r\nupper atmosphere that the scope-readers had mistaken dust-clouds for\r\nsolid ground.\r\n\r\nWith ports blinded by dust, the possibility of that error had been\r\nobvious enough. The navigator knew the risk. He chanced it--and lost\r\nthe toss.\r\n\r\nGeorge knew he was still alive only because he'd acted like a childish\r\neager-beaver. And had been tolerated by the others because he was the\r\ncrew's youngest member.\r\n\r\nEver since he could read and dream, he'd wanted to be the first man\r\never to touch the soil of Venus. So, having no duties connected\r\nwith setting down the ship, he'd gotten into his space-suit and had\r\nwaited by a hatch. He was standing there when the ship went into the\r\ntwenty-mile free fall that smashed it.\r\n\r\nGeorge didn't know who opened the escape hatch and shoved him out. That\r\nman was dead, along with the rest of the crew. Unlike George's suit,\r\nthe space-ship had no parachute.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe'd landed blind, in dust so thick he didn't know he was down till he\r\ngot there. For forty-eight hours he'd lain where he fell, waiting for a\r\nlull in the storm so he could see the ship.\r\n\r\nWhen the wind finally quit, the ship was already half buried. Thirsty,\r\nhungry, stinking in the hot suit, George had staggered over windrow\r\nafter windrow of dust to reach it.\r\n\r\nHe'd broken out an emergency-jug of water, found some uncontaminated\r\nfood, erected within the hull a small gas-proof tent, and then passed\r\nout before he could crawl in the tent to eat and drink.\r\n\r\nLater he'd gone out while the lull continued, to search for bodies.\r\nLike the hull itself, they were scattered over a wide area. Some were\r\nalready buried in dust. The wind had buried them.\r\n\r\nThe wind--the murdering wind. The wind of formaldehyde that poisoned\r\nevery drop of water it touched, every bit of food. The wind that\r\nlimited George's supplies to unbroken containers--of which there were\r\ntragically few.\r\n\r\nThe wind mocked him, then and thereafter. It mocked his efforts to find\r\nthe ship's log and continue it. 

It mocked his efforts to live.\r\n\r\nHe tried to fight back. He lay prone and relaxed because that took less\r\noxygen. He lay in the suit and not in the tent because that took less\r\noxygen. He ate and drank but once a day because that took less oxygen.\r\n\r\nSo he had run out of water while there were still some potassium oxides\r\nleft to refresh his thrice-breathed air, some oxygen for the tent.\r\n\r\nGeorge Main wanted to live, knew he would die. And was enraged at the\r\nthought that he would die without having accomplished anything. He and\r\nhis friends, and the pioneering scientists back of them, had put too\r\nmuch effort into trans-System travel to have it all come to nothing\r\nlike this.\r\n\r\nStubbornly he noted in the log that he was now dehydrated to the point\r\nof occasional delirium. And that he hated the wind.\r\n\r\nAs if that wind had not already done enough, it now sought to destroy\r\nhis last remaining moments of sanity. It brought a horde of odd shapes\r\nto haunt him.\r\n\r\nThe shapes literally rolled into the dust-filled metal cavity where he\r\nlay writing. The wind rolled them. But when they got into shelter--had\r\nrolled to one side or the other of the holes through which they'd\r\ncome--the shapes began to move, slowly, under their own power.\r\n\r\nThey all looked alike. There were a couple of dozen, maybe--George\r\ncounted ten and gave up because counting was too much like work. They\r\nwere teardrops--eight-inch yellow teardrops with the point down.\r\nAnd each point rested on an extensible foot that looked like a blue\r\nstarfish, about four inches across its seven points.\r\n\r\nThey came in, rolling along the ground as the wind took them, and then\r\nextended their stars from some hidden place and moved on them when out\r\nof the wind.\r\n\r\nThat is, they seemed to. But whether they were in the hull or in his\r\nmind, George was by no means sure.\r\n\r\nNothing could live in this wind. Nothing could live on a planet with\r\nno water, where the air was full of formaldehyde ready to react with\r\nproteins, the basis of life.\r\n\r\nHe lay motionless, watching idly. There was no sound but the wind. 

The\r\nyellow teardrops scattered out. They could have been exploring--or\r\nseeking shelter--or nonexistent.\r\n\r\nWhen he got tired of watching them, George put the log aside and slept.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe awoke to find a small congregation of teardrops surrounding the\r\nwatch strapped outside the suit on his left wrist. The watch was\r\ngoing--wound through habit every twenty-four hours, though that was but\r\na third of a day, here on Venus. The teardrops were curious about it.\r\n\r\nHow he got the idea they were curious, George didn't quite know. They\r\nseemed attracted to it, was all. There were no eyes, so far as he\r\ncould tell--no ears. If these things had senses, they were not like\r\nterrestrial senses. But the teardrops did have an attitude of attention.\r\n\r\nGeorge removed his watch, laid it before them. Two teardrops detached\r\nthemselves from the group to examine his right hand, with which he'd\r\nslipped off the wrist-band. Three others perched on the dust-covered\r\ndeck, the watch between them and him.\r\n\r\nGeorge flexed his right hand, twiddled his fingers. The teardrops\r\nseemed unafraid. He chose one and lifted it. It seemed light in weight.\r\nIts star-foot was slightly prehensile, and grasped his glove with tiny\r\nclaws arranged in rows on its bottom surface.\r\n\r\nThe claws seemed for clinging, not for seizing. George put down the\r\nteardrop, turned it over, and found no opening anywhere on the surface.\r\nIf these things lived, he decided, they must be plants, synthesizing\r\ntheir food--they had no way to eat as animals do.\r\n\r\nVaguely, George made up his wavering mind that the things existed\r\noutside his imagination. They were alive. 

They felt curiosity about\r\nhim. Leathery, he found them--hard and smooth, except for the foot.\r\n\r\nWhen he set down the teardrop he'd been examining, the three by his\r\nwatch took up a rhythmic motion. The center one stood in place,\r\nswaying slowly above the watch like a bit of seaweed in a quiet lagoon.\r\n\r\nEach of the other two had somehow obtained a pebble. They set their\r\npebbles down near the watch. Each then tapped with a star-point, first\r\nat the pebble, then at the watch. Back and forth they swayed, their\r\nmotions synchronized--perhaps directed by the center one.\r\n\r\nInteresting--but meaningless. It was equally meaningless when the two\r\nteardrops at his right began to dance. They found an empty food-can\r\nlid, pushed it near his hand, and began a concerted swaying and\r\npointing that took them between hand and can.\r\n\r\nIdly, George led the dance with a waggled forefinger. The teardrops\r\npromptly changed their motion. They stood in place, no longer pointing\r\nalternately at lid and finger, but swaying between them in time with\r\nGeorge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Idly, George led the dance with a waggled\r\nforefinger...._]\r\n\r\nThey were slow, though--he could easily have left them behind. But if\r\nhe moved his finger slowly enough, they kept perfect time.\r\n\r\nThe dance at the watch had stopped. Many teardrops gathered around the\r\npair that followed the beat of his right index finger.\r\n\r\nIt must have amused them. But it soon tired George. He stopped.\r\n\r\nHe needed all his remaining energy to think with. He knew these\r\nteardrops were sentient. They were curious, they communicated with each\r\nother, and they danced. They had minds, therefore.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGeorge remembered hearing that Man had danced even before he learned\r\nto speak, in a primitive effort to express his feelings. He knew some\r\nbirds dance, too--as a courtship procedure. Insects, even.\r\n\r\nBut why did the teardrops dance?\r\n\r\nWhat was the significance of rhythmic motion between a pebble and a\r\nwatch? A tin lid and a man's hand? What did the pebbles mean?\r\n\r\nThe pebble was a native object, known to be lifeless, inanimate. The\r\nwatch was a strange something that moved. 

The can-lid did not move.\r\nThe hand--gloved, though they could not know that--was an object that\r\nmoved.\r\n\r\nThe dance was a question, therefore. Alive, or dead? 

The teardrops\r\nwanted to know. Is the watch that moves by itself alive? The strangely\r\nsymmetrical lid of a can, is it alive? The oddshaped hand?\r\n\r\nThese teardrops had good minds--could grasp abstractions. In a sense,\r\nGeorge felt, the difference between animate and inanimate objects is an\r\nabstraction. In his dying state, the notion amused him.\r\n\r\nSmiling, he placed a pebble on the watch, another on the lid. He sat\r\nup, moved his weakened body so they could perhaps tell it was a unit.\r\nHe picked up a teardrop in each hand, held them at his visor, rolled\r\nhis eyes, and opened and shut his mouth. He spoke to them. 

He sang to\r\nthem. He swayed with them to show he too could dance.\r\n\r\nThey made no sign of reply. None that he could recognize, at any rate.\r\n\r\nCarefully he felt and looked at the entire surface of a teardrop,\r\nputting one down to devote both hands to the other. He thought perhaps\r\nthe lack of organs and openings might simply mean they were clothed or\r\narmored in some way. But the thing was apparently naked. The surfaces\r\nhe touched were probably skin. He didn't know.\r\n\r\nAnd they, would they know what a man was? Were they even certain he was\r\nalive?\r\n\r\nOne of them was behind him, dancing before the tent. Seeing that, he\r\nwas certain the teardrops hadn't yet distinguished the animate from the\r\ninanimate in the objects around them here.\r\n\r\nAnd George had little time to teach them. Already he was dull and\r\nlistless. His vision was playing tricks on him.\r\n\r\nLike as not he'd be dead before they knew for certain he'd been alive.\r\nDead in the grotesque space-suit. Preserved in an atmosphere of\r\nformaldehyde. His body would seem like a machine that had run down.\r\nThere would be no discernable difference between himself and his watch.\r\n\r\nBut if they knew he'd been alive? They might remember, then. 

They were\r\nintelligent, could communicate with one another. By rights they should\r\nhave some kind of legends or traditions or history. If they did, if\r\nthey knew they'd seen alien life, they'd keep the memory alive.\r\n\r\nThey'd recognize the next man to land on Venus, might find means\r\nto tell of this first expedition. Might lead a man to the buried\r\nspace-ship, the bodies, the ship's log.\r\n\r\nAt least they could defeat the wind. The teardrops could keep his life\r\nand the lives of his mates from going utterly to waste. Whether men\r\never found out or not, the teardrops themselves would know that the\r\nexpedition had reached Venus.\r\n\r\nBut first, George had to prove he was alive, like them--not some\r\nstrangely mobile meteorite, nor oddly contrived machine.\r\n\r\nHis very lack of strength, his real nearness to death, provided George\r\nwith the means he sought. Already he was half anesthetized by weakness\r\nand shock. 

He didn't have to worry about pain.\r\n\r\nHolding his breath, he took off his helmet. He picked up a teardrop\r\nwith each hand, held them to his hot cheeks. Then he let himself\r\nbreathe.\r\n\r\nHe knew the physical changes to follow would be obvious to the\r\nintelligent little dancers he held in his hands. He hoped they wouldn't\r\nget hurt, when they fell.\r\n\r\nHurt or not, they'd soon figure out he'd been alive--once he was\r\ndead....\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


"\r\n\r\nStanley Rapp blinked, considering the matter. He always thought over\r\neverything very carefully. Of course, some questions were easier to\r\nanswer than others. This one, for instance. He had very few doubts about\r\nhis name.\r\n\r\n"Uh," Stanley Rapp said. "Yes. 

Yes."\r\n\r\nHe stared at the bearded young man. Living in the Village, even on the\r\nbetter side of it, one saw beards every day, all shapes and sizes of\r\nbeard. This one was not a psychoanalyst beard, or a folk singer beard;\r\nnot even an actor beard. This was the scraggly variety, almost certainly\r\na poet beard. 

Mr. Rapp, while holding no particular prejudice against\r\npoets, had not sent for one, he was sure of that.\r\n\r\nThen he noticed the toolcase in the bearded young man\'s hand, lettered\r\nlarge LIGHTNING SERVICE, TV, HI-FI.\r\n\r\n"Oh," Stanley said, nodding. "You\'re the man to fix the TV set."\r\n\r\n"You know it, Dad," the young man said, coming in. He shut the door\r\nbehind him, and stared around the apartment. "What a wild pad. Where the\r\nidiot box, hey?"\r\n\r\nThe pleasantly furnished, neat little apartment was not what Mr. Rapp\r\nhad ever thought of as a "wild pad." But the Village had odd standards,\r\nMr. Rapp knew. Chacun a son gout, he had said, on moving into the\r\napartment ten years ago. Not aloud, of course, because he had only taken\r\none year of French, and would never have trusted his accent. But chacun\r\na son gout, anyway.\r\n\r\n"The television set," Mr. Rapp said, translating. 

"Oh, yes." 

He went to\r\nthe closet door and opened it. Reaching inside, he brought out an\r\nimposingly large TV set, mounted on a wheeled table. The bearded\r\nrepairman whistled.\r\n\r\n"In the closet," the repairman said, admiringly. "Crazy. 

You go in there\r\nto watch it, or you let it talk to itself?"\r\n\r\n"Oh. Well, I don\'t exactly watch it at all," Mr. Rapp said, a little\r\nsadly. "I mean, I can\'t. That\'s why I called you."\r\n\r\n"Lightning\'s here, have no fear," the bearded one said, approaching the\r\nset with a professional air. "Like, in the closet, hey." He bent over\r\nthe set, appraisingly. "I thought you were a square, Pops, but I can see\r\nyou\'re.... Hey, this is like too much. Man, I don\'t want to pry, but why\r\nis this box upside down?"\r\n\r\n"I wish I knew," Mr. Rapp said. He sat down, and leaned back, sighing.\r\nThis was going to be difficult, he knew. He had already had to explain\r\nit to the last three repairmen, and he was getting tired of explaining.\r\nAlthough he thought, somehow, that this young man might understand it a\r\nlittle more quickly than the others had.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve had a couple of other repairmen look it over," Mr. Rapp told the\r\nbearded one. 

"They ... well, they gave up."\r\n\r\n"Dilettantes," commented the beard.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," Mr. Rapp said. 

"One of them was from the company that made it.\r\nBut they couldn\'t do anything."\r\n\r\n"Let\'s try it," the repairman said, plugging the cord into a wall\r\nsocket. He returned to the set, and switched it on, without changing\r\nits upside down position. The big screen lit almost at once; a pained\r\nface appeared, with a large silhouetted hammer striking the image\'s\r\nforehead in a rhythmic beat.\r\n\r\n"... Immediate relief from headache," a bland voice said, as the\r\npictured face broke into a broad smile. The repairman shuddered, and\r\nturned down the sound, staring at the image with widened eyes as he did\r\nso.\r\n\r\n"Dad, I don\'t want to bug you," the repairman said, his eyes still on\r\nthe screen, "only, look. The set is upside down, right?"\r\n\r\n"Right," said Mr. Rapp.\r\n\r\n"Only the picture--" the repairman paused, trying to find the right\r\nphrase. "I mean, the picture\'s flipped. Like, it\'s wrong side up, too.\r\nOnly, right side up, now."\r\n\r\n"Exactly," said Mr. Rapp. "You see, that\'s the trouble. I put the set\r\nupside down because of that."\r\n\r\n"Cool," the repairman said, watching the picture. "I mean, so why worry?\r\nYou got a picture, right? You want me to turn the picture around? I can\r\ndo that with a little fiddling around inside the set ... uh-oh. Dad,\r\nsomething\'s happening."\r\n\r\n          *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe repairman bent closer, staring at the picture. It was now showing a\r\nbusty young woman singer, her mouth opened, but silent, since the sound\r\nwas turned down. She was slowly rotating as Rapp and the bearded\r\nrepairman watched, turning until her face, still mouthing silent song,\r\nhung upside down on the screen.\r\n\r\n"It always does that," Rapp said. "No matter which way I put the set,\r\nthe picture\'s always upside down."\r\n\r\n"No, man," the repairman said, pleadingly. "Look, I took a course. I\r\nmean, the best school, you dig? It don\'t work that way. 

It just can\'t."\r\n\r\n"It does, though," Rapp pointed out. "And that\'s what the other repair\r\npeople said, too. They took it out, and brought it back, and it still\r\ndid it. Not when they had it in their shops, but the minute it came back\r\nhere, the picture went upside down again."\r\n\r\n"Wow," the repairman said, backing slowly away from the set, but\r\nwatching it with the tense gaze of a man who expected trouble. After a\r\nminute he moved toward it again, and took hold of the cabinet sides,\r\nlifting.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to put you down, Pops," he said, grunting. "Only, I got to\r\nsee this. Over she goes." He set it down again, right side up. The\r\npicture, still the singer\'s face, remained in a relatively upright\r\nposition for another moment, and then slowly rolled over, upside down\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"You see," Mr. Rapp said, shrugging. "I guess I\'ll have to buy another\r\nset. Except I\'d hate to have it happen again, and this one did cost\r\nquite a lot."\r\n\r\n"You couldn\'t trade it in, either," the repairman agreed. "Not to me,\r\nanyway." Suddenly he snapped his fingers. "Hey now. Sideways?"\r\n\r\n"You mean on its side?"\r\n\r\n"Just for kicks...." the repairman gripped the set again. "On the\r\nside...." He set the cabinet down, on one side, and stepped back, to\r\nregard the picture again.\r\n\r\nSlowly, the picture turned once more, and once again, relative to the\r\nusual directions of up and down, the picture was stubbornly, completely\r\ninverted.\r\n\r\n"It\'s onto that, too," the repairman said, gloomily. He sat down on the\r\nfloor, and assumed a kind of Yoga posture, peering between his legs.\r\n"You could try it this way, Pops."\r\n\r\n"I\'m pretty stiff," Mr. Rapp told him, shaking his head.\r\n\r\n"Yeah," the repairman said, reinverting himself. For a long while he\r\nsat, pulling his beard thoughtfully, a look of deep thought on his face.\r\nThe reversed singer faded out, to give place to an earnestly grinning\r\nannouncer who pointed emphatically to a large, upside down sign bearing\r\nthe name of a product.\r\n\r\n"Watching it this way could get to be a fad," the repairman said, at\r\nlast, almost inaudibly. He fell silent again, and Mr. Rapp, sadly, began\r\nto realize that even this bearded and confident young man had apparently\r\nbeen stopped, like the others.\r\n\r\n"The way I look at it, like, there\'s a place where science hangs up,"\r\nthe bearded one spoke, finally.\r\n\r\n"Like, I don\'t want to put down my old Guru at the Second Avenue School\r\nof Electronics," he added, solemnly. "But you got to admit that there\r\nare things not dreamed of in your philosophy, Horatio. You dig?"\r\n\r\n"My name isn\'t Horatio," Mr. Rapp objected.\r\n\r\n"I was quoting," the repairman told him. "I mean, this is a thing like,\r\noutside material means. Supernatural, sort of. Did you cross up any\r\nwitches lately, Pops?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear," Mr. Rapp said sadly. He shook his head. "No, I haven\'t ...\r\ner, offended any witches. Not that I know of." 

He regarded the inverted\r\npicture for a moment. Then, as the repairman\'s words began to sink in,\r\nMr. Rapp looked at him apprehensively.\r\n\r\n"Witches?" Mr. Rapp asked. "But ... I mean, that\'s all superstition,\r\nisn\'t it? And anyway ... well, television sets!"\r\n\r\n"They used to dry up cows, but who keeps cows?" the bearded one said\r\nominously. "Why not television sets? Like, I happen to be personally\r\nacquainted with several witches and like that. The Village is full of\r\nthem. However--" He rose, and stalked toward the set, his eyes\r\nglittering in a peculiar way. "You\'re a lucky one, Daddyo. Back in my\r\nsquare days, I did some reading up on the hookups between poetry and\r\nmagic. Now, I\'m a poet. Therefore, and to wit, I\'m also a magician. On\r\nthis hangup, I\'m going to try magic. Electronics won\'t work, that\'s for\r\nsure."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"But...." Mr. Rapp was not quite sure why he disapproved, but he did. On\r\nthe other hand, the repairman appeared to be very definitely sure of\r\nwhat he was doing, as he peered into the back of the television set.\r\n\r\n"Have you ever tried ... ah, this method before?"\r\n\r\n"Never ran into any hexed TV sets before," the repairman said,\r\nstraightening up. "Don\'t worry, though. 

I got the touch, like with\r\npoetry. Same thing, in fact. All magic spells rhyme, see? Well, I used\r\nto rhyme, back before I really started swinging. Anybody can rhyme. And\r\nthe rest is just instinct."\r\n\r\nHe had been scribbling something on a notepad, as he spoke. Now he bent\r\ndown, to take another look at the back of the set, and nodded with an\r\nair of assurance.\r\n\r\n"The tube layout," the repairman told Mr. Rapp, exhibiting his notebook.\r\n"That, and Ohm\'s Law, and a couple of Hindu bits I picked up listening\r\nto the UN on the radio ... makes a first-class spell."\r\n\r\nMr. Rapp backed away, nervously. "Look, if it\'s all the same to you...."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t flip." The repairman consulted his notebook, and moved to stand\r\nin front of the screen. The picture showed a smiling newscaster,\r\npointing to a map which indicated something ominous.\r\n\r\n"Cool, man," the repairman said. "Here we go." He lifted his hands in an\r\necclesiastical gesture, and his voice became a deep boom.\r\n\r\n"6SN7, 6ac5, six and seven millivolts are running down the line, E\r\nequals R times A, that\'s the way it goes, go round the other way, Subhas\r\nChandra BOSE!"\r\n\r\nAfterward, Mr. Rapp was never quite sure exactly what happened. He had\r\nan impression of a flash of light, and an odd, indefinite sound rather\r\nlike the dropping of a cosmic garbage can lid. But possibly neither the\r\nlight nor the sound actually happened; at any rate, there were no\r\ncomplaints from the neighbors later on. However, the lighted screen was\r\ncertainly doing something.\r\n\r\n"Crazy!" the repairman said, in awed tones.\r\n\r\nMr. Rapp, his view partly blocked by the repairman, could not see\r\nexactly what was happening on the screen. However, he caught a brief\r\nglimpse of the newscaster\'s face. It was right side up, but no longer\r\nsmiling. Instead, the pictured face wore a look of profound alarm, and\r\nthe newsman was apparently leaning far forward, his face almost out of\r\nfocus because of its nearness to the lens. Just for a moment, Mr. Rapp\r\ncould have sworn he saw a chair floating _up_, past the agonized\r\nexpression on the screen.\r\n\r\nThen the screen want gray, and a panel of lettering appeared, shaking\r\nslightly.\r\n\r\nOUR PICTURE HAS BEEN TEMPORARILY INTERRUPTED. NORMAL SERVICE WILL BE\r\nRESTORED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. PLEASE STAND BY.\r\n\r\n"I was going to give you a bill," the repairman said. "Only maybe we\r\nbetter just charge it up to customer relations."\r\n\r\nThe letters remained steady on the screen, and Mr. Rapp studied them.\r\nThey were right side up.\r\n\r\n"You fixed it," Mr. Rapp said, a little uncertainly. 

"I mean, it\'s\r\nworking. I ought to pay...."\r\n\r\n"I goofed," the repairman said. He picked up his tools, and moved toward\r\nthe door. "Like, I won\'t mention it to anybody if you won\'t. But I\r\ngoofed, all right. 

Didn\'t you see the picture?"\r\n\r\n"But whatever you did ... it worked," Mr. Rapp said. "The picture\'s\r\nright side up."\r\n\r\n"I know," the repairman said. "Only somewhere ... there\'s a studio\r\nthat\'s upside down. I just goofed, Pops, that\'s all.

"\r\n\r\nHe closed the door behind him, leaving Mr. Rapp still staring at the\r\nimmobile, right-side-up message on the glowing screen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe End.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n


That\'s all."\r\n\r\nIt took a few minutes for Ferris to recover. Replacement! After six\r\nyears of service at the number one fuel station between the Earth\r\nand Moon. Why, he was the only man who could handle Station 12! And\r\nGalsworth was sending Brooks, a green kid barely out of SM school. What\r\nwas the guy thinking of?\r\n\r\nAngered, Ferris got up from his stool and paced the floor. It was easy\r\nto picture Galsworth sitting at his desk. He\'d be chewing a big cigar,\r\npounding a pudgy fist into his palm, telling young Brooks that Station\r\n12 needed a stalwart lad willing to face numerous cosmic dangers in\r\norder that commerce between the Earth and Moon would not fall below its\r\npresent status. Only Galsworth would say it like that.\r\n\r\nWell, what was wrong with the present status? Ferris had kept the\r\ncompany heads above water; he hadn\'t fallen down on the job. But they\r\napparently weren\'t satisfied. Something was wrong, and it seemed that\r\nGalsworth was taking it out on Ferris.\r\n\r\nStill perplexed, Ferris entered his living quarters and began packing.\r\nHe dismissed Galsworth from his mind, wondered whether or not Brooks\r\ncould meet the task of operating the station. It was a lonely job,\r\nsitting there in the cylindrical island of space, watching ships\r\napproach and pass in the cold void that housed him. Brooks would grow\r\nweary of it, just as Ferris had at first. There wasn\'t a more dismal\r\nexistence in the solar system, but to Ferris it was home, and even the\r\nthought of that was comforting.\r\n\r\nThe sound of a hissing airlock brought Ferris to his senses. Brooks was\r\nahead of schedule--\r\n\r\nFerris went back to the control room. A tall fellow stood there, his\r\nhair drooping, his space tunic ripped open at the collar. His face was\r\nstone-like.\r\n\r\n"You aren\'t Brooks," said Ferris. "What do you want?"\r\n\r\n"Fuel," the other dropped a hand to a belt holster. "I need fuel for\r\nmy ship--a lot of it. And you\'re the only fellow in my path who\'s got\r\nit. 

Let\'s not waste time.

"\r\n\r\n"You\'ve come to the wrong place," said Ferris, starting forward. "The\r\nbarrels here are under government combination seal, and can\'t be opened\r\nby anyone other than the inspectors who accompany our regular ships."\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless," the tall fellow drew his beam gun, "you have fuel in\r\nyour repulsion tanks, and that\'s as good as any."\r\n\r\nFor a moment Ferris stood there, undetermined. 

Then he remembered a\r\npolice bulletin not so long ago. A convict had escaped from one of\r\nEarth\'s interplanetary prisons. He understood now.\r\n\r\n"You\'re Siegal," he said.\r\n\r\nThe other nodded. "My ship hasn\'t the fuel to carry me to the Moon. I\r\ndon\'t like to insist, but I\'m going to drain your tanks."\r\n\r\n"The station will fall," Ferris warned. "If the repulsion tanks are\r\ndrained, gravity will take hold."\r\n\r\n"Unfortunate," said Siegal, "but it\'s me or the station. I\'ve brought a\r\nhose along--also a container. I\'ll give you the pleasure of filling it\r\nfor me. 

Hurry.

"\r\n\r\nFerris had no choice, so he did as directed. Siegal had the drop on\r\nhim, and it was best to play safe. Perhaps he could talk the fellow out\r\nof his wild plan. There was a chance.\r\n\r\n"Think you\'ll make it to the Moon?" queried Ferris as he loosened a\r\nvalve and inserted the hose. "It\'s a long trek for such a small amount\r\nof fuel. Besides, you\'ll burn up half the stuff getting started.\r\nThere\'s no launch here, you know."\r\n\r\n"I left Earth without a launch," said Siegal crisply. "I can do it\r\nagain."\r\n\r\nThe syphon began a steady flow.\r\n\r\n"You won\'t make it," remarked Ferris. "And if you do get there, what\r\nthen? There\'s no place for you on the Moon. They\'ll track you down in a\r\nfew days."\r\n\r\nSiegal laughed. "You seem quite certain of all this."\r\n\r\n"Besides," went on Ferris, "I\'ll tell them all about you. They\'ll know\r\njust where you are, and they\'ll be waiting for you when you reach the\r\nMoon."\r\n\r\n"Not if I destroy your radio," said Siegal, "and not if you ride the\r\nstation back to Earth."\r\n\r\nFor a long minute there was silence. The only sound was the trickling\r\nof the liquid fuel. Ferris became uneasy.\r\n\r\n"That\'s murder," he said at length.\r\n\r\n"True," agreed Siegal. "That is murder, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\nThe container was full. At the point of Siegal\'s gun, Ferris carried\r\nthe fuel to the airlock, where he was forced to don a space tunic and\r\ntransport the container to the lone ship that was anchored outside.\r\nHe made several trips, until the station\'s tanks were nearly empty.\r\nThrough vision screens, the glow of the repulsion jets could be seen,\r\nreceding gradually.\r\n\r\n"The station will move in a matter of hours," said Ferris. "It\'s a\r\ndevilish trick, Siegal, and I hope they get you for it.

"\r\n\r\n"Never mind. 

Just fill the container again. I want to be sure the tank\r\nis empty."\r\n\r\nFerris set to work again. As he bent over the tanks, the floor gave a\r\nsudden lurch and threw him against the wall. Siegal clutched a door\r\nframe and steadied himself.\r\n\r\n"No tricks, Ferris."\r\n\r\n"But the station\'s moving. 

Can\'t you see?"\r\n\r\n"Sooner than you expected. Perhaps you can tell me why."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, Siegal. Something\'s happened."\r\n\r\n"It\'s all right, finish your work."\r\n\r\nFerris complied. Once more the precious liquid trickled into the\r\ncontainer. Minutes passed.\r\n\r\n"Brooks reporting, sir."\r\n\r\nSiegal turned, astounded. 

The red-headed youngster stood there, a\r\nlook of bewilderment on his face. Then Ferris leaped, caught Siegal\r\nabout the hips and sent him sprawling over the station floor. But the\r\nconvict was elusive. He twisted free, somewhat dazed, and stood erect.\r\nHe fired a beam at Ferris, who rolled across the floor in pain. Brooks,\r\nrealization having dawned upon him, started forward. Siegal emitted a\r\nshrill noise, grabbed the container and ran for the airlock. Brooks\r\nblocked his way, and went down as the gun struck his skull. Siegal\r\nleaped over him, vanishing a moment later beyond the airlock.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHis brain in a turmoil, Ferris got slowly to his feet and looked about.\r\nThe room was empty. No Siegal, no Brooks. The station was tilted at\r\nan angle, swaying slightly. It was falling, due to the excess weight\r\napplied when Brooks anchored his cruiser.\r\n\r\nFerris nursed his aching head. The beam had shaved his neck just below\r\nthe ear, breaking his space tunic\'s glass helmet, otherwise doing no\r\nharm.\r\n\r\nFerris made his way to the airlock. Through the heavy glass he glimpsed\r\na portion of Siegal\'s ship. Quickly, a plan formed in his mind.\r\n\r\nHe removed a metal space suit from a locker, donned it and clumped\r\nawkwardly up a stairway leading to the upper level. He crossed to a\r\nsecond airlock, advanced through, and stepped lightly onto the top of\r\nSiegal\'s ship. He dropped flat and crawled to the supply lock, through\r\nwhich a ship\'s food bundles were loaded. He grasped the latch firmly,\r\nand waited.\r\n\r\nA minute later the little cruiser moved into space. Behind, Fuel\r\nStation 12 continued its Earthward fall. Ferris watched it go, his\r\nheart heavy. All his belongings went with Station 12, all the things he\r\nhad called his home for six long years. He wondered about Brooks. The\r\nfellow\'s cruiser was drifting lifelessly to one side, no doubt having\r\nbeen cut free by Siegal. There was no evidence of Brooks\' whereabouts.\r\n\r\nFerris clung to the heavy latch as Siegal\'s cruiser slipped away in\r\nspace. Above and all around him hovered the vast outline of Earth, the\r\ncontinents and oceans showing dimly through the deep shadows. To the\r\nleft was the Moon, drifting aimlessly along the great star-curtain.\r\n\r\nFerris tugged at the latch. It moved a little. 

He tugged again and it\r\nsprang free. Ferris stood up, straddled the circular lock, and pulled\r\nback the cover. Air rushed out. Through the narrow hole he saw the tiny\r\nstorage compartment. Satisfied, he let himself through and dropped to\r\nthe floor, pulling the cover back in place as he did so.\r\n\r\nThe room was small--only a few feet higher than Ferris, not much\r\nlonger. The sound of the oxygen pumps grew louder for a moment, as the\r\nsemi-vacuum was being replaced.\r\n\r\nFerris waited several minutes, then removed the space suit. Finding the\r\nair suitable, he stepped to the compartment door, opened it a crack,\r\nand peered out.\r\n\r\nSteps led downward to a brief corridor. Beyond the corridor, a portion\r\nof the control room was visible.\r\n\r\nFerris moved out, went down the steps and proceeded cautiously along\r\nthe corridor.\r\n\r\nHe put a hand to his forehead; a sudden dizziness swept through him.\r\nHe leaned against the wall, rubbing his eyes. There was blood on his\r\nsleeve.\r\n\r\nHe couldn\'t remember how long he waited there; it may have been a\r\nnumber of minutes. He could feel his sickness overcoming him. He was\r\nweakening.\r\n\r\nA footstep sounded, and Ferris tried to open his eyes. Then he turned\r\nto go back, but a voice stopped him. It was Siegal\'s.\r\n\r\nThere was no use resisting. Siegal still had the drop on him. The\r\nconvict led him into the control cabin, forced him into a seat.\r\n\r\n"You\'re a good man, Ferris," Siegal said, "but not good enough. I might\r\nbe able to use you, though--more or less as a shield when I get to the\r\nMoon."\r\n\r\nSomewhat revived, Ferris looked up. His head still hurt him, but he was\r\nable to recollect his surroundings. He thought of Fuel Station 12--it\r\nwould be nearing Earth now. Soon it would strike, and then Galsworth\r\nwould be notified. Things would begin to happen.\r\n\r\n"Brooks reporting.

"\r\n\r\nSiegal swung, shouting angrily. But the youth was on him, knocking\r\nthe beam gun away, pinning him against the wall of the cabin. Ferris\r\nwatched dazedly, wondering where Brooks had come from. Nauseating\r\nsensations swept him again, and things went black for a moment. He\r\nheard Siegal\'s yells. A blow was struck, and Brooks tumbled back.\r\n\r\nFerris pushed himself from the stool and fell over the beam gun. As\r\nSiegal bore Brooks to the floor, Ferris rolled over, brought up his arm\r\nand pulled the trigger. His aim was bad, but the beam did its work.\r\nSiegal simply went limp.\r\n\r\nFor a long minute Ferris lay there, looking up at the youthful form of\r\nBrooks over him. He grinned.\r\n\r\n"Good work, Brooks. You make a better stowaway than I do."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"This is the first time," said Galsworth, "I\'ve ever seen bandages on\r\nyou, Ferris."\r\n\r\n"I came to talk business, Galsworth. At least, you called me here for\r\nthat reason, didn\'t you?"\r\n\r\nThe company head placed a pudgy fist against his palm. "Of course. I\r\nthought you\'d like to know why you were called in from 12."\r\n\r\n"Because you wanted to send Brooks there. Well, that\'s okay. 

He\'s a\r\ngood man--"\r\n\r\n"No, not just that. We\'ve a passenger pilot\'s license for you, if you\r\nwant it. Something we\'ve been planning for some time. You\'re the only\r\none of our station operators who has passed the exams."\r\n\r\nFerris grew red in the face. "Then, all this was just a--promotion?"\r\n\r\nGalsworth nodded. "When the new Station 12 is situated, Brooks will\r\ntake over. We\'ve better things for you. 

Willing?"\r\n\r\nTo Ferris, it was overwhelming--more so than it had been aboard\r\nSiegal\'s cruiser. He felt suddenly as if he would faint--the wound--\r\n\r\nHe did faint right there in Galsworth\'s office, but when he revived\r\nGalsworth was still smiling. It was all right--after six years!\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


Phui!"\r\n\r\nSimone was washing the dishes, gazing out across the windowsill where\r\ntwo pink and white Murex shells stood, to the tidy garden beyond where\r\nNina was engaged in her private games.\r\n\r\nShe dried the dishes by passing her hand once above each plate or glass,\r\nbringing it to a dry sparkle. It saved wear on the dishtowels, and it\r\namused her.\r\n\r\n"Sam\'s not home very much," she said in a placating voice. She herself\r\nhad grown terrified, since her marriage, that she wouldn\'t be able to\r\nbear the weight of her past. She felt its power on her and couldn\'t\r\ncarry it. Cecily had brought her up, after her father had disappeared\r\nand her mother had died in an unexplained accident. Daily she saw the\r\nreflection of her failure in the face of her grandmother, who seemed\r\nbuilt of the same seasoned and secure wood as the old Putnam house.\r\nSimone looked at her grandmother, whom she loved, and became a mere\r\nvapor.\r\n\r\n"He\'s not home so much," Simone said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHer face was small, with a pointed chin, and she had golden-red hair\r\nwhich she wore loose on her shoulders. Nina, too, had a small face, but\r\nit was neither so pale nor so delicate as her mother\'s, as if Sam\'s\r\ntougher substance had filled her out and strengthened her bone\r\nstructure. If it was true that she, Simone, was a weak link, then Sam\'s\r\nstrength might have poured into the child, and there would be no more\r\nPutnam family and tradition.\r\n\r\n"People don\'t change that easily," the old woman said.\r\n\r\n"But things--" Simone began. The china which had a history of five\r\ngenerations slipped out of her hands and smashed; Sam\'s toaster wouldn\'t\r\ntoast or pop up; Simone couldn\'t even use the telephone for fear of\r\ngetting a wrong number, or no number at all.\r\n\r\n"Things, things!" her grandmother cried. "It\'s blood that counts. If the\r\nblood is strong enough, things dissolve. They\'re just garbage, all those\r\nthings, floating on the surface of our history. It\'s our history that\'s\r\ndeep. 

That\'s what counts."\r\n\r\n"You\'re afraid of Sam," the young woman accused.\r\n\r\n"Not afraid of any man!" Cecily said, straightening her back. "But I\'m\r\nafraid for the child. Sam has no family tradition, no depth, no talent\r\nhanded down and perfected. A man with his head full of wheels and\r\nwires."\r\n\r\nSimone loved him. She leaned on him and grew about him, and he supported\r\nher tenderly. She wasn\'t going to give him up for the sake of some\r\nabstract tradition--\r\n\r\n"--it\'s not abstract," her grandmother said with spirit. "It\'s in your\r\nblood. Or why don\'t you sweep the floors the way other women do? The way\r\nSam\'s mother must?"\r\n\r\nSimone had begun to clean the house while she was thinking, moving her\r\nhand horizontally across the floor, at the height of her hip, and the\r\ndust was following the motion of her hand and moving in a small,\r\nsun-brightened river toward the trash basket in the kitchen corner. Now\r\nSimone raised her hand to her face to look at it, and the river of dust\r\nrose like a serpent and hung a foot below her hand.\r\n\r\n"Yes," she agreed, "at least I can clean the house. If I don\'t touch the\r\ngood china, and look where I\'m going."\r\n\r\n"Phui," the old woman said again, angrily. 

"Don\'t feel so sorry for\r\nyourself."\r\n\r\n"Not for myself," Simone mumbled, and looked again toward the garden\r\nwhere her daughter was doing something with three stones and a pie plate\r\nfull of spring water.\r\n\r\n"I do despair of Nina," Cecily said, as she had said before. "She\'s\r\nfour, and has no appearance. Not even balance. She fell out of the\r\napplerose tree, and couldn\'t even help herself." Suddenly the old woman\r\nthrust her face close to her granddaughter. It was smooth, round, and\r\nsweet as a young kernel of corn. The eyes, sunk down under the bushy\r\ngrey brows, were cold and clear grey.\r\n\r\n"Simone," the old woman said. "You didn\'t lie to me? You did know she\r\nwas falling, and couldn\'t get back in time to catch her?"\r\n\r\nA shudder passed through Simone\'s body. There was no blood in her veins,\r\nonly water; no marrow in her bones, they were empty, and porous as a\r\nbird\'s. Even the roots of her hair were weak, and now the sweat was\r\nstarting out on her scalp as she faced her grandmother and saw the\r\nbristling shapes of seven generations of Putnam women behind her.\r\n\r\n"You lied," the old woman said. "You didn\'t know she was falling."\r\n\r\nSimone was a vapor, a mere froth blowing away on the first breeze.\r\n\r\n"My poor dear," the old woman said in a gentle voice. "But how could you\r\nmarry someone like Sam? Don\'t you know what will happen? 

He\'ll dissolve\r\nus, our history, our talents, our pride. Nina is nothing but an ordinary\r\nlittle child."\r\n\r\n"She\'s a good child," Simone said, trying not to be angry. She wanted\r\nher child to be loved, to be strong. "Nina isn\'t a common child," she\r\nsaid, with her head bent. "She\'s very bright."\r\n\r\n"A man with his head full of wheels, who\'s at home with electricity and\r\nwires," the old woman went on. "We\'ve had them before, but never allowed\r\nthem to dominate us. My own husband was such a man, but he was only\r\nallowed to make token gestures, such as having the power lines put in.\r\nHe never understood how they worked." She lowered her voice to a\r\nwhisper, "Your Sam understands. I\'ve heard him talk to the water pump."\r\n\r\n"That\'s why you\'re afraid of him," Simone said. "Not because I\'m weak,\r\nand he might take something away from me, but because he\'s strong, and\r\nhe might give us something. Then everything would change, and you\'re\r\nafraid of that. 

Nina might be our change." She pointed toward the\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFollowing the white line of her granddaughter\'s finger, Cecily looked\r\nout into the garden and saw Nina turn toward them as though she knew\r\nthey were angry. The child pointed with one finger directly at them in\r\nthe house. There was a sharp crackle, and something of a brilliant and\r\nvibrating blue leaped between the out-stretched fingers of mother and\r\ndaughter, and flew up like a bird to the power lines above.\r\n\r\n"Mommy," Nina called.\r\n\r\nSimone\'s heart nearly broke with wonder and fright. Her grandmother\r\ncontemptuously passed through the kitchen door and emerged on the step\r\noutside, but Simone opened the door and left it open behind her. "What\r\nwas that?" 

she asked Nina. "Was it a bluebird?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be silly," Nina said. She picked up the pie plate and brought it\r\ntoward them. Cecily\'s face was white and translucent, one hand went to\r\nher throat as the child approached.\r\n\r\nBrimfull of crackling blue fire with a fluctuating heart of yellow, the\r\npie plate came toward them, held between Nina\'s small, dusty hands. Nina\r\ngrinned at them. "I stole it out of the wires," she said.\r\n\r\nSimone thought she would faint with a mixture of joy and fear. "Put it\r\nback," she whispered. 

"Please put it back."\r\n\r\n"Oh Mommy," Nina said, beginning to whine. "Not now. 

Not right away. I\r\njust got it. 

I\'ve done it lots of times." The pie plate crackled and\r\nhissed in the steady, small hands.\r\n\r\nSimone could feel the old woman\'s shocked silence behind her. "You\r\nmustn\'t carry it in a pie plate, it\'s dangerous," Simone said to her\r\nchild, but she could see Nina was in no danger. "How often have you done\r\nthis?" She could feel her skirt and her hair billow with electricity.\r\n\r\n"Lots of times. You don\'t like it, do you?" She became teasing and\r\nroguish, when she looked most like Sam. Suddenly she threw back her head\r\nand opened her mouth, and tilting up the pie plate she drank it empty.\r\nHer reddish gold hair sprang out in crackling rays around her face, her\r\neyes flashed and sparks flew out between her teeth before she closed her\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n"Nina!" the old woman cried, and began to crumple, falling slowly\r\nagainst Simone in a complete faint. Simone caught her in trembling hands\r\nand lowered her gently. She said to her daughter, "You mustn\'t do that\r\nin front of Grandy. You\'re a bad girl, you knew it would scare her," and\r\nto herself she said: I must stop babbling, the child knows I\'m being\r\nsilly. O isn\'t it wonderful, isn\'t it awful, O Sam, how I love you.\r\n\r\n"Daddy said it would scare you," Nina admitted. "That\'s why I never\r\nshowed you before." Her hair was softly falling into place again, and\r\nshe was gazing curiously at her great-grandmother lying on the doorstep.\r\n\r\n"It did scare me," Simone said. "I\'m not used to it, darling. 

But don\'t\r\nkeep it secret any more."\r\n\r\n"Is Grandy asleep?"\r\n\r\nSimone said hastily, "Oh yes, she\'s taking a nap. She is old, you know,\r\nand likes to take naps."\r\n\r\n"That\'s not a nap," Nina said, leaning over and patting the old woman\'s\r\ncheek, "I think she\'s having a bad dream."\r\n\r\nSimone carried her grandmother into the house. If that old, tired heart\r\nhad jumped and floundered like her own, there must be some damage done\r\nto it. If anything happened to her grandmother, the world would end,\r\nSimone thought, and was furious with Nina, and at the same time, full of\r\njoy for her.\r\n\r\nCecily Putnam opened her eyes widely, and Simone said, "It does change,\r\nyou see. But it\'s in the family, after all.

"\r\n\r\nThe old woman sat upright quickly. "That wicked child!" she exclaimed.\r\n"To come and frighten us like that. She ought to be spanked." She got up\r\nwith great strength and rushed out to the garden.\r\n\r\n"Nina!" she called imperiously. The child picked up one of the small\r\nstones from the pie plate now full of spring water, and came to her\r\ngreat-grandmother.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll make something for you, Grandy," she said seriously. She put the\r\nstone in the palm of her hand, and breathed on it, and then held out her\r\nhand and offered the diamond.\r\n\r\n"It\'s lovely. Thank you," the old woman said with dignity, and put her\r\nhand on the child\'s head. "Let\'s go for a walk and I\'ll show you how to\r\ngrow rose-apples. That\'s more becoming to a young lady."\r\n\r\n"You slept on the step."\r\n\r\n"Ah! I\'m old and I like to take little naps," Cecily answered.\r\n\r\nSimone saw them disappear among the applerose trees side by side. She\r\nwas still trembling, but gradually, as she passed her hand back and\r\nforth, and the dust followed, moving in a sparkling river toward the\r\ntrash basket, Simone stopped trembling and began to smile with the\r\nnatural pride of a Putnam woman.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ January 1963.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

Edwardson asked, standing at the port,\r\nlooking at the stars.\r\n\r\n"No," Morse said. He had been staring fixedly at the Attison Detector\r\nfor over an hour. Now he blinked three times rapidly, and looked again.\r\n"Not a millimeter."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think it moved either," Cassel added, from behind the gunfire\r\npanel. And that was that. The slender black hand of the indicator rested\r\nunwaveringly on zero. The ship\'s guns were ready, their black mouths\r\nopen to the stars. A steady hum filled the room. It came from the\r\nAttison Detector, and the sound was reassuring. It reinforced the fact\r\nthat the Detector was attached to all the other Detectors, forming a\r\ngigantic network around Earth.\r\n\r\n"Why in hell don\'t they come?" Edwardson asked, still looking at the\r\nstars. "Why don\'t they hit?"\r\n\r\n"Aah, shut up," Morse said. He had a tired, glum look. High on his right\r\ntemple was an old radiation burn, a sunburst of pink scar tissue. From a\r\ndistance it looked like a decoration.\r\n\r\n"I just wish they\'d come," Edwardson said. He returned from the port to\r\nhis chair, bending to clear the low metal ceiling. "Don\'t you wish\r\nthey\'d come?" Edwardson had the narrow, timid face of a mouse; but a\r\nhighly intelligent mouse. One that cats did well to avoid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you?" he repeated.\r\n\r\nThe other men didn\'t answer. They had settled back to their dreams,\r\nstaring hypnotically at the Detector face.\r\n\r\n"They\'ve had enough time," Edwardson said, half to himself.\r\n\r\nCassel yawned and licked his lips. "Anyone want to play some gin?" 

he\r\nasked, stroking his beard. The beard was a memento of his undergraduate\r\ndays. Cassel maintained he could store almost fifteen minutes worth of\r\noxygen in its follicles. He had never stepped into space unhelmeted to\r\nprove it.\r\n\r\nMorse looked away, and Edwardson automatically watched the indicator.\r\nThis routine had been drilled into them, branded into their\r\nsubconscious. They would as soon have cut their throats as leave the\r\nindicator unguarded.\r\n\r\n"Do you think they\'ll come soon?" Edwardson asked, his brown rodent\'s\r\neyes on the indicator. The men didn\'t answer him. After two months\r\ntogether in space their conversational powers were exhausted. They\r\nweren\'t interested in Cassel\'s undergraduate days, or in Morse\'s\r\nconquests.\r\n\r\nThey were bored to death even with their own thoughts and dreams, bored\r\nwith the attack they expected momentarily.\r\n\r\n"Just one thing _I\'d_ like to know," Edwardson said, slipping with ease\r\ninto an old conversational gambit. "How far can they do it?"\r\n\r\nThey had talked for weeks about the enemy\'s telepathic range, but they\r\nalways returned to it.\r\n\r\nAs professional soldiers, they couldn\'t help but speculate on the enemy\r\nand his weapons. It was their shop talk.\r\n\r\n"Well," Morse said wearily, "Our Detector network covers the system out\r\nbeyond Mars\' orbit."\r\n\r\n"Where we sit," Cassel said, watching the indicators now that the others\r\nwere talking.\r\n\r\n"They might not even know we have a detection unit working," Morse said,\r\nas he had said a thousand times.\r\n\r\n"Oh, stop," Edwardson said, his thin face twisted in scorn. "They\'re\r\ntelepathic. They must have read every bit of stuff in Everset\'s mind."\r\n\r\n"Everset didn\'t know we had a detection unit," Morse said, his eyes\r\nreturning to the dial. "He was captured before we had it."\r\n\r\n"Look," Edwardson said, "They ask him, \'Boy, what would you do if you\r\nknew a telepathic race was coming to take over Earth? How would you\r\nguard the planet?\'"\r\n\r\n"Idle speculation," Cassel said. "Maybe Everset didn\'t think of this.

"\r\n\r\n"He thinks like a man, doesn\'t he? Everyone agreed on this defense.\r\nEverset would, too."\r\n\r\n"Syllogistic," Cassel murmured. 

"Very shaky."\r\n\r\n"I sure wish he hadn\'t been captured," Edwardson said.\r\n\r\n"It could have been worse," Morse put in, his face sadder than ever.\r\n"What if they\'d captured _both_ of them?"\r\n\r\n"I wish they\'d come," Edwardson said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRichard Everset and C. R. Jones had gone on the first interstellar\r\nflight. They had found an inhabited planet in the region of Vega. The\r\nrest was standard procedure.\r\n\r\nA flip of the coin had decided it. Everset went down in the scouter,\r\nmaintaining radio contact with Jones, in the ship.\r\n\r\nThe recording of that contact was preserved for all Earth to hear.\r\n\r\n"Just met the natives," Everset said. "Funny-looking bunch. 

Give you the\r\nphysical description later.

"\r\n\r\n"Are they trying to talk to you?" Jones asked, guiding the ship in a\r\nslow spiral over the planet.\r\n\r\n"No. Hold it. 

Well I\'m damned! They\'re telepathic! How do you like\r\nthat?"\r\n\r\n"Great," Jones said. "Go on.

"\r\n\r\n"Hold it. Say, Jonesy, I don\'t know as I like these boys. They haven\'t\r\ngot nice minds. 

Brother!

"\r\n\r\n"What is it?" Jones asked, lifting the ship a little higher.\r\n\r\n"Minds! These bastards are power-crazy. Seems they\'ve hit all the\r\nsystems around here, looking for someone to--"\r\n\r\n"Yeh?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got that a bit wrong," Everset said pleasantly. "They are not so\r\nbad."\r\n\r\nJones had a quick mind, a suspicious nature and good reflexes. He set\r\nthe accelerator for all the G\'s he could take, lay down on the floor and\r\nsaid, "Tell me more."\r\n\r\n"Come on down," Everset said, in violation of every law of spaceflight.\r\n"These guys are all right. As a matter of fact, they\'re the most\r\nmarvelous--"\r\n\r\nThat was where the recording ended, because Jones was pinned to the\r\nfloor by twenty G\'s acceleration as he boosted the ship to the level\r\nneeded for the C-jump.\r\n\r\nHe broke three ribs getting home, but he got there.\r\n\r\nA telepathic species was on the march. What was Earth going to do about\r\nit?\r\n\r\nA lot of speculation necessarily clothed the bare bones of Jones\'\r\ninformation. Evidently the species could take over a mind with ease.\r\nWith Everset, it seemed that they had insinuated their thoughts into\r\nhis, delicately altering his previous convictions. They had possessed\r\nhim with remarkable ease.\r\n\r\nHow about Jones? Why hadn\'t they taken him? Was distance a factor? Or\r\nhadn\'t they been prepared for the suddenness of his departure?\r\n\r\nOne thing was certain. Everything Everset knew, the enemy knew. That\r\nmeant they knew where Earth was, and how defenseless the planet was to\r\ntheir form of attack.\r\n\r\nIt could be expected that they were on their way.\r\n\r\nSomething was needed to nullify their tremendous advantage. But what\r\nsort of something? 

What armor is there against thought? How do you dodge\r\na wavelength?\r\n\r\nPouch-eyed scientists gravely consulted their periodic tables.\r\n\r\nAnd how do you know when a man has been possessed? Although the enemy\r\nwas clumsy with Everset, would they continue to be clumsy? Wouldn\'t they\r\nlearn?\r\n\r\nPsychologists tore their hair and bewailed the absence of an absolute\r\nscale for humanity.\r\n\r\nOf course, something had to be done at once. The answer, from a\r\ntechnological planet, was a technological one. Build a space fleet and\r\nequip it with some sort of a detection-fire network.\r\n\r\nThis was done in record time. The Attison Detector was developed, a\r\ncross between radar and the electroencephalograph. Any alteration from\r\nthe typical human brain wave pattern of the occupants of a\r\nDetector-equipped ship would boost the indicator around the dial. Even a\r\nbad dream or a case of indigestion would jar it.\r\n\r\nIt seemed probable that any attempt to take over a human mind would\r\ndisturb something. There had to be a point of interaction, somewhere.\r\n\r\nThat was what the Attison Detector was supposed to detect. Maybe it\r\nwould.\r\n\r\nThe spaceships, three men to a ship, dotted space between Earth and\r\nMars, forming a gigantic sphere with Earth in the center.\r\n\r\nTens of thousands of men crouched behind gunfire panels, watching the\r\ndials on the Attison Detector.\r\n\r\nThe unmoving dials.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Do you think I could fire a couple of bursts?" Edwardson asked, his\r\nfingers on the gunfire button. "Just to limber the guns?"\r\n\r\n"Those guns don\'t need limbering," Cassel said, stroking his beard.\r\n"Besides, you\'d throw the whole fleet into a panic."\r\n\r\n"Cassel," Morse said, very quietly. "Get your hand off your beard."\r\n\r\n"Why should I?" Cassel asked.\r\n\r\n"Because," Morse answered, almost in a whisper, "I am about to ram it\r\nright down your fat throat."\r\n\r\nCassel grinned and tightened his fists. 

"Pleasure," he said. "I\'m tired\r\nof looking at that scar of yours." He stood up.\r\n\r\n"Cut it," Edwardson said wearily. "Watch the birdie."\r\n\r\n"No reason to, really," Morse said, leaning back. "There\'s an alarm bell\r\nattached." But he looked at the dial.\r\n\r\n"What if the bell doesn\'t work?" Edwardson asked. "What if the dial is\r\njammed? How would you like something cold slithering into your mind?"\r\n\r\n"The dial\'ll work," Cassel said. His eyes shifted from Edwardson\'s face\r\nto the motionless indicator.\r\n\r\n"I think I\'ll sack in," Edwardson said.\r\n\r\n"Stick around," Cassel said. "Play you some gin."\r\n\r\n"All right." Edwardson found and shuffled the greasy cards, while Morse\r\ntook a turn glaring at the dial.\r\n\r\n"I sure wish they\'d come," he said.\r\n\r\n"Cut," Edwardson said, handing the pack to Cassel.\r\n\r\n"I wonder what our friends look like," Morse said, watching the dial.\r\n\r\n"Probably remarkably like us," Edwardson said, dealing the cards. Cassel\r\npicked them up one by one, slowly, as if he hoped something interesting\r\nwould be under them.\r\n\r\n"They should have given us another man," Cassel said. "We could play\r\nbridge."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t play bridge," Edwardson said.\r\n\r\n"You could learn."\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t we send a task force?" Morse asked. "Why didn\'t we bomb\r\ntheir planet?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be dumb," Edwardson said. "We\'d lose any ship we sent. Probably\r\nget them back at us, possessed and firing."\r\n\r\n"Knock with nine," Cassel said.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t give a good damn if you knock with a thousand," Edwardson said\r\ngaily. "How much do I owe you now?"\r\n\r\n"Three million five hundred and eight thousand and ten. Dollars."\r\n\r\n"I sure wish they\'d come," Morse said.\r\n\r\n"Want me to write a check?"\r\n\r\n"Take your time. Take until next week."\r\n\r\n"Someone should reason with the bastards," Morse said, looking out the\r\nport. Cassel immediately looked at the dial.\r\n\r\n"I just thought of something," Edwardson said.\r\n\r\n"Yeh?"\r\n\r\n"I bet it feels horrible to have your mind grabbed," Edwardson said. "I\r\nbet it\'s awful."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll know when it happens," Cassel said.\r\n\r\n"Did Everset?"\r\n\r\n"Probably. He just couldn\'t do anything about it."\r\n\r\n"My mind feels fine," Cassel said. "But the first one of you guys starts\r\nacting queer--watch out."\r\n\r\nThey all laughed.\r\n\r\n"Well," Edwardson said, "I\'d sure like a chance to reason with them.\r\nThis is stupid."\r\n\r\n"Why not?" Cassel asked.\r\n\r\n"You mean go out and meet _them_?"\r\n\r\n"Sure," Cassel said. "We\'re doing no good sitting here."\r\n\r\n"I should think we could do something," Edwardson said slowly. "After\r\nall, they\'re not invincible. They\'re reasoning beings."\r\n\r\nMorse punched a course on the ship\'s tape, then looked up.\r\n\r\n"You think we should contact the command? Tell them what we\'re doing?"\r\n\r\n"No!" Cassel said, and Edwardson nodded in agreement. "Red tape. We\'ll\r\njust go out and see what we can do. 

If they won\'t talk, we\'ll blast \'em\r\nout of space."\r\n\r\n"Look!"\r\n\r\nOut of the port they could see the red flare of a reaction engine; the\r\nnext ship in their sector, speeding forward.\r\n\r\n"They must have got the same idea," Edwardson said.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s get there first," Cassel said. Morse shoved the accelerator in\r\nand they were thrown back in their seats.\r\n\r\n"That dial hasn\'t moved yet, has it?" Edwardson asked, over the clamor\r\nof the Detector alarm bell.\r\n\r\n"Not a move out of it," Cassel said, looking at the dial with its\r\nindicator slammed all the way over to the highest notch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Space Science Fiction_ September 1953.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            They awoke after ages of hiding--to emerge into\r\n            a world richer than they had dared to dream of!\r\n\r\n\r\nRik\'s first impressions were an uncomfortable chill creeping along his\r\nbare flesh, and a bright milky swirling of light that encompassed his\r\nentire vision. He shivered and blinked his eyes a few times, and then\r\nthe swirling settled down and became the vault. The chill, he realized,\r\nwas due to the body warmth being methodically sucked away by the cold\r\nslab on which he lay. Another shiver brought a gasp of breath into his\r\nlungs, and then he was wide awake.\r\n\r\nWhen he sat up and swung his legs over the side, the interior of the\r\nvault began swirling again. He had to grip the edge of the slab to keep\r\nfrom falling. The air was humid, much too humid, and he could taste the\r\nprickly presence of carbon dioxide when he breathed. "The pump," he\r\nmumbled, dropping to the floor on feet that he could barely control.\r\n"Something\'s happened to the pump."\r\n\r\nHe pushed himself determinedly erect, then stumbled down the long\r\ncorridor between the other slabs, hardly glancing at their silent\r\ntenants, until he got to Zina\'s. She lay still as death, not flicking\r\nso much as an eyelid, and her flesh was like frozen wax beneath his\r\nexploring fingers.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing he could do for her until he got the pump working\r\nagain....\r\n\r\nRik pushed away from the slab on which Zina lay, and went through the\r\narchway into the next chamber. Here another fifty of the group lay on\r\ntheir slabs, not so much as a muscle twitch betraying the fact that\r\nthey were all quite alive. It seemed only a few hours since he had lain\r\ndown on his slab in the other room and gotten his injection, but he\r\ncould not, for a dizzy moment, recall in which direction the pump lay.\r\nHis mind seemed to be plumbing dust-covered depths to dredge out his\r\nmemories, one by one.\r\n\r\nHe suddenly remembered the War. The war that had driven the group to\r\nbuild this place, to try and safeguard a handful from the holocaust\r\nthat would set fire to the surface of the world and turn the seas to\r\nsteam. Was it possible the war had passed? Or had it ever come!\r\n\r\nThere was no way to know without going outside--Wait! 

There was!\r\nRik thought hard, trying to get his sense of direction back. The\r\natom-powered clock that marked off months instead of minutes was in the\r\ncentral vault, where the elders slept. The other nine vaults ringed\r\nthat one, he recalled, veering at right angles to his first direction,\r\nwhich would have taken him on a circular tour of the nine vaults and\r\nback to his starting place again.\r\n\r\nThe archway to the vault of the elders was unaccountably blocked,\r\nand Rik realized suddenly that part of the ceiling there had fallen,\r\ncarried by some fault in the granite of the mountain itself. But that\r\nwas impossible! 

The elders had selected this site on the basis of the\r\nrigidity of the rocky strata that made it up. A fault could not have\r\noccurred for more years than Rik\'s own lifetime--\r\n\r\nOr had that many years passed already?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was no way of knowing; not until he had examined the clock. Rik\r\nmoved away from the blockade and made his way into the next vault, and\r\nthe next, finally finding an archway in the sixth vault from his own\r\nwhere the rock had not completely sealed the way into the elders\' vault.\r\n\r\nHere he had expected to find the air fresher, already having theorized\r\nthat the staleness elsewhere was due to the poor circulation occasioned\r\nby the blockaded central vault. But in fact the air there was even\r\nworse, and laden with an odor that made Rik suddenly afraid to see its\r\nsource.\r\n\r\nStill, he was the first to awake. It was up to him to try and save\r\nhimself and the others. Rik made an effort of will, and then squeezed\r\nthrough the narrow orifice into the main chamber. He looked once toward\r\nthe slabs holding the bodies of the elders, then quickly away. It was\r\ntrue. All were in advanced stages of corruption already.\r\n\r\nChoking, Rik went to the center of the high room and looked into the\r\nhorizontal face of the clock. The broad indicator arm was at its\r\nutmost numeral, and was pocked with rust. They\'d lain here beyond the\r\ntime-of-awakening by at least four times the years they\'d planned!\r\n\r\n"It can\'t be right," Rik gasped, his brain reeling for want of clean,\r\ncool air. "The mechanism has failed somehow." Afraid to think about it,\r\nhe tilted the clock up on its base until the pedestal which supported\r\nit lay on its side upon the floor. The square block of metal that\r\nbased the pedestal was now uptilted beyond the vertical, exposing a\r\ngaping trap in the floor. Rik did not like the tarnished look of the\r\nmetal underside of the pedestal-base, forged of an alloy supposed\r\nto be incorruptible. A sick thought took hold of his insides then,\r\nas he placed one foot upon the rocky staircase under the floor. The\r\nclock-indicator had halted at its utmost numeral.\r\n\r\nBut what if they\'d lain here even longer than that? There would be no\r\nway of knowing. No way at all.\r\n\r\nHe descended the staircase swiftly then, glad at least that the air\r\nwas better down in the pump chamber. "It would be, of course," he\r\nreminded himself, "if the pump went off, even. This air would never\r\nbe circulated, never have its chance to become corrupt with our\r\nexhalations." And then his musing was halted in midthought as he came\r\nupon the pump. Or upon what had been the pump.\r\n\r\nWhere rigid cylinders of gleaming metal had been, a few jagged teeth of\r\nbrown corruption lay in a circle. The pistons were no better, though\r\ntheir thickness had preserved more of their original shape despite the\r\ninroads of age, so they could be recognized for what they were--had\r\nbeen. The central shaft was a long mound of flaking dust on the floor\r\nbetween the path of the pistons, and the wall-sized mass of the\r\nfilters--woven of metal and powerful synthetic fibers--crumbled beneath\r\nthe pressure of his finger.\r\n\r\nHe sought and found the ponderous casing in which the engine-empowering\r\nradioactive element had lain, and its thick walls tore away like wood\r\npulp in his hands. The element, when he found it, was already become\r\ncold grey lead. And it had had a half-life of centuries....\r\n\r\nRik crumpled slowly to the floor, shutting his eyes, trying not to\r\nthink of the eons which must have passed while they all lay sleeping\r\nthe pseudodeath in the vaults. What might the world have become in the\r\ninterim!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA current of cool air suddenly touched his face. His head came up\r\ninstantly, his eyes seeking the source.\r\n\r\nA feathery motion of torn edges in the filter showed him that it came\r\nthrough the gap he had torn there. Rik sprang to his feet then, leaped\r\nat the filter and tore out chunks by the armful, letting the pulverized\r\nmaterial float in spinning clouds of dust motes behind him. The air\r\ngrew stronger, came faster, as he ripped away the corruption, and then\r\nhe could see the tunnel beyond.\r\n\r\nGasping at the effort--how long since he had eaten?--he staggered\r\nback from the opening then back up the stairs into the chamber of the\r\nelders. Now that his nostrils had been stimulated by the clean air the\r\nsmell of corruption was violently repelling; but he held his breath and\r\nran to the gap in the tumbled rock about the archway, and squeezed his\r\nway into the area of subsidiary vaults.\r\n\r\nWithout the pump in operation, the air could not circulate to this\r\npoint, but he hoped to drag some of his companions down to the torn\r\nfilter and revive them--then, with their help, bring the others.\r\n\r\nIt would be all right. They would be saved, as planned. He regretted\r\nthe loss of the elders. But no matter. 

They were but the rulers. He\r\nand the others were the chemists, the scientists, the engineers. New\r\nelderships could be created when they had become settled again, and\r\ncould rebuild their civilization.\r\n\r\nHe went to Zina\'s slab first. She would not be as much help as some of\r\nthe others, but Zina and he were too close for him to delay her revival\r\nany longer. Life was not worth having without Zina. He carried her out\r\nof the vault, through the gap and thick miasma of corruption, then down\r\ninto the pump chamber. Leaving her lying on her back, with the breeze\r\nruffling her hair about her face, Rik went back up for the next person.\r\n\r\nThree exhausting trips later, he sat among the bodies of his friends,\r\nlistening with joy to their returning quiver of breath and life. Zina\r\nwas the first to open her eyes. She seemed startled to find she was no\r\nlonger on the slab, and then joyous when her glance fell upon his eager\r\nface.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve done it!" she sighed. "We came through!" She tried to sit up,\r\nthen lay down heavily. "Rik--I\'m so weak...."\r\n\r\n"We need food, all of us," he said. "I\'m weak myself." He arose from\r\nhis crouch at her side and stared down the tunnel to the outer world.\r\n"I don\'t know what it\'s like out there," he said. "There may be no food\r\nat all. If the War was as devastating as predicted, it may be barren\r\nrock, burning sun and overall death.

"\r\n\r\n"How long--?" Zina began, and then her eyes fell upon the time-rotted\r\nhulk of the pump and she stopped, her face going pale. "As long as\r\nthat!" 

she whispered. "Oh, Rik! Do you think--?

"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll know when I\'ve looked," he said. Their eyes met for a long,\r\nsilent moment, then he turned and started up the tunnel.\r\n\r\nThree hundred strides brought him to the barrier, the thinly\r\nperforated shield of rock that had been left intact to hide the\r\nlocation of the vaults from their enemies. Rik put his shoulder to the\r\nshell. It cracked and fell away as he\'d thought it would, with weather\r\nand erosion having weakened it for centuries. Bright yellow moonlight\r\nlay all about the land outside. Incredibly fine sand was everywhere,\r\nbut a smell of fresh water and green growing things was mingled with\r\nthe night air. The region had not been desert when the vaults were\r\nconstructed. The War had left its mark of devastation here, Rik saw,\r\nlooking in vain for a trace of the magnificent towered city that had\r\nonce been just beyond this spot.\r\n\r\nHe shook off his dismay and set himself to the task for which he\'d\r\nemerged.\r\n\r\nThe animals had to be alive, yet, or they were doomed. He\'d always\r\nregretted the haste in their preparations that had precluded preparing\r\nsurvival vaults for the food animals. The best they\'d been able to do,\r\nbefore the Day of Devastation, was herd the stupid beasts into caves\r\nand pile the entrances with loose rock, hoping the animals would dig\r\nthemselves out only after the worst fury of the War had passed.... Rik\r\nthrew off the bitter memory, abruptly, as his ears detected a tiny buzz\r\nof sound.\r\n\r\nHe dropped to the ground and lay still, watching to see what sort of\r\nbeast would appear. It sounded larger than the animals he remembered.\r\n"I must be near a waterhole," he reasoned. "There\'s a pathway here,\r\nmade by many animals passing this way...." he mused, studying the\r\nnarrow, flattened track that he\'d spotted in the night-chilled sand.\r\n\r\nThen he saw something coming slowly up the trail, a thing much larger\r\nthan the animals he remembered.\r\n\r\nIt was a long moment before he realized what it was, and smiled. Then\r\nhe reached out his hands and had it. 

It buzzed loudly in his grip until\r\nhe pounded it to silence on a rock. By the time he\'d returned to the\r\npump chamber, he\'d managed to prise it open, but its contents--mangled\r\nby the smashing upon the rock--were barely fit to eat.\r\n\r\n"It\'s better than I could have hoped," he said to Zina, when they and\r\nthe others had picked the thing clean. "Life promises to be much more\r\nexciting, infinitely more sporting in this new age outside the vaults.\r\nWith care, we can survive until our engineers rig up some whip-rays and\r\nherding-claws again."\r\n\r\n"It _will_ be fun," Zina agreed, smiling with grim anticipation. "I\r\nenjoy a challenge in the hunt. 

Who\'d have thought the animals would\r\nhave come so _far_ from the caves!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was hours later that the bus company grew worried about their\r\nmissing vehicle, and started an investigation. But they could find no\r\ntrace of the bus, anywhere, and it remained a mystery until the day\r\neverybody suddenly knew what had happened.\r\n\r\nBut that was far too late.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


He waved at the bystanders. "Clear a path through here; I\'m\r\ntakin\' my prisoner over to the jail."\r\n\r\n"Jest a dad-blamed minute, Sheriff." Stump\'s face was pale, his\r\nglasses were gone and one khaki shoulder strap dangled--but what was\r\nalmost a grin twisted one meaty cheek. He hid his hands behind his\r\nback, leaned away from the cuffs. "I don\'t like that word \'prisoner\'.\r\nI ast you fer pertection. And better look out who you go throwin\' that\r\nword \'murder\' off at, too. 

I ain\'t murdered nobody."\r\n\r\nThe sheriff blinked, turned to roar, "How\'s the victim, Doc?"\r\n\r\nA small gray head rose from bending over the limp form of the Fianna.\r\n"Deader\'n a mackerel, Sheriff."\r\n\r\n"I guess that\'s it. 

Let\'s go, Cecil."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the charge?"\r\n\r\n"First degree murder."\r\n\r\n"Who\'d I murder?"\r\n\r\n"Why, you killed this here ... this stranger."\r\n\r\n"That ain\'t no stranger. That\'s a varmint. Murder\'s got to do with\r\nkillin\' humerns, way I understand it. You goin\' to tell me that thing\'s\r\nhumern?"\r\n\r\nTen people shouted at once:\r\n\r\n"--human as I am!"\r\n\r\n"--intelligent being!"\r\n\r\n"--tell me you can simply kill--"\r\n\r\n"--must be some kind of law--"\r\n\r\nThe sheriff raised his hands, his jowls drawn down in a scowl. "What\r\nabout it, Judge Gates? Any law against Cecil Stump killing the ...\r\nuh...?"\r\n\r\nThe judge thrust out his lower lip. "Well, let\'s see," he began.\r\n"Technically--"\r\n\r\n"Good Lord!" 

someone blurted. "You mean the laws on murder don\'t define\r\nwhat constitutes--I mean, what--"\r\n\r\n"What a humern is?" Stump snorted. "Whatever it says, it sure-bob don\'t\r\ninclude no purple worms. That\'s a varmint, pure and simple. Ain\'t no\r\ndifferent killin\' it than any other critter."\r\n\r\n"Then, by God, we\'ll get him for malicious damage," a man called. "Or\r\nhunting without a license--out of season!"\r\n\r\n"--carrying concealed weapons!"\r\n\r\nStump went for his hip pocket, fumbled out a fat, shapeless wallet,\r\nextracted a thumbed rectangle of folded paper, offered it.\r\n\r\n"I\'m a licensed exterminator. Got a permit to carry the gun, too.\r\nI ain\'t broken no law." He grinned openly now. "Jest doin\' my job,\r\nSheriff. And at no charge to the county."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA smaller man with bristly red hair flared his nostrils at Stump.\r\n"You blood-thirsty idiot!" He raised a fist and shook it. "We\'ll be\r\na national disgrace--worse than Little Rock! Lynching\'s too good for\r\nyou!"\r\n\r\n"Hold on there, Weinstein," the sheriff cut in. "Let\'s not go gettin\'\r\nno lynch talk started."\r\n\r\n"Lynch, is it!" Cecil Stump bellowed, his face suddenly red. "Why, I\r\ndone a favor for every man here! Now you listen to me! 

What is that\r\nthing over there?" He jerked a blunt thumb toward the judicial bench.\r\n"It\'s some kind of critter from Mars or someplace--you know that as\r\nwell as me! And what\'s it here for? 

It ain\'t for the good of the likes\r\nof you and me, I can tell you that. It\'s them or us. And this time, by\r\nGod, we got in the first lick!"\r\n\r\n"Why you ... you ... hate-monger!

"\r\n\r\n"Now, hold on right there. I\'m as liberal-minded as the next feller.\r\nHell, I like a nigger--and I can\'t hardly tell a Jew from a white man.\r\nBut when it comes to takin\' in a damned purple worm and callin\' it\r\nhumern--that\'s where I draw the line."\r\n\r\nSheriff Hoskins pushed between Stump and the surging front rank of the\r\ncrowd. 

"Stay back there! I want you to disperse, peaceably, and let the\r\nlaw handle this."\r\n\r\n"I reckon I\'ll push off now, Sheriff," Stump hitched up his belt.\r\n"I figgered you might have to calm \'em down right at first, but\r\nnow they\'ve had a chance to think it over and see I ain\'t broken\r\nno law, ain\'t none of these law-abiding folks going to do anything\r\nillegal--like tryin\' to get rough with a licensed exterminator just\r\ndoin\' his job." He stooped, retrieved his gun.\r\n\r\n"Here, I\'ll take that," Sheriff Hoskins said. "You can consider your\r\ngun license canceled--and your exterminatin\' license, too."\r\n\r\nStump grinned again, handed the revolver over.\r\n\r\n"Sure. I\'m cooperative, Sheriff. Anything you say. 

Send it around to my\r\nplace when you\'re done with it." He pushed his way through the crowd to\r\nthe corridor door.\r\n\r\n"The rest of you stay put!" a portly man with a head of bushy white\r\nhair pushed his way through to the bench. "I\'m calling an emergency\r\nTown Meeting to order here and now!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe banged the gavel on the scarred bench top, glanced down at the body\r\nof the dead alien, now covered by a flag.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen, we\'ve got to take fast action. If the wire services get\r\nhold of this before we\'ve gone on record, Willow Grove\'ll be a blighted\r\narea."\r\n\r\n"Look here, Willard," Judge Gates called, rising. "This--this mob isn\'t\r\ncompetent to take legal action."\r\n\r\n"Never mind what\'s legal, Judge. Sure, this calls for Federal\r\nlegislation--maybe a Constitutional amendment--but in the meantime,\r\nwe\'re going to redefine what constitutes a person within the\r\nincorporated limits of Willow Grove!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s the least we can do," a thin-faced woman snapped, glaring at\r\nJudge Gates. "Do you think we\'re going to set here and condone this\r\noutrage?"\r\n\r\n"Nonsense!" Gates shouted. "I don\'t like what happened any better than\r\nyou do--but a person--well, a person\'s got two arms and two legs and--"\r\n\r\n"Shape\'s got nothing to do with it," the chairman cut in. "Bears walk\r\non two legs! Dave Zawocky lost his in the war. Monkeys have hands."\r\n\r\n"Any intelligent creature--" the woman started.\r\n\r\n"Nope, that won\'t do, either; my unfortunate cousin\'s boy Melvin was\r\nborn an imbecile, poor lad. Now, folks, there\'s no time to waste. 

We\'ll\r\nfind it very difficult to formulate a satisfactory definition based\r\non considerations such as these. However, I think we can resolve the\r\nquestion in terms that will form a basis for future legislation on the\r\nquestion. It\'s going to make some big changes in things. Hunters aren\'t\r\ngoing to like it--and the meat industry will be affected. But if, as\r\nit appears, we\'re entering into an era of contact with ... ah ...\r\ncreatures from other worlds, we\'ve got to get our house in order."\r\n\r\n"You tell \'em, Senator!" someone yelled.\r\n\r\n"We better leave this for Congress to figger out!" another voice\r\ninsisted.\r\n\r\n"We got to do something...."\r\n\r\nThe senator held up his hands. "Quiet, everybody. There\'ll be reporters\r\nhere in a matter of minutes. Maybe our ordinance won\'t hold water. But\r\nit\'ll start \'em thinking--and it\'ll make a lots better copy for Willow\r\nGrove than the killing."\r\n\r\n"What you got in mind, Senator?"\r\n\r\n"Just this:" the Senator said solemnly. "A person is ... _any harmless\r\ncreature_...."\r\n\r\nFeet shuffled. Someone coughed.\r\n\r\n"What about a man who commits a violent act, then?" Judge Gates\r\ndemanded. "What\'s he, eh?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s obvious, gentlemen," the senator said flatly. "He\'s vermin."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the courthouse steps Cecil Stump stood, hands in hip pockets,\r\ntalking to a reporter from the big-town paper in Mattoon, surrounded\r\nby a crowd of late-comers who had missed the excitement inside. He\r\ndescribed the accuracy of his five shots, the sound they had made\r\nhitting the big blue snake, and the ludicrous spectacle the latter\r\nhad presented in its death agony. He winked at a foxy man in overalls\r\npicking his nose at the edge of the crowd.\r\n\r\n"Guess it\'ll be a while \'fore any more damned reptiles move in here\r\nlike they owned the place," he concluded.\r\n\r\nThe courthouse doors banged wide; excited citizens poured forth,\r\nveering aside from Cecil Stump. The crowd around him thinned, broke up\r\nas its members collared those emerging with the hot news. The reporter\r\npicked a target.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you\'d care to give me a few details of the action taken by\r\nthe ... ah ... Special Committee, sir?"\r\n\r\nSenator Custis pursed his lips. "A session of the Town Council was\r\ncalled," he said. "We\'ve defined what a person is in this town--"\r\n\r\nStump, standing ten feet away, snorted. "Can\'t touch me with no _ex\r\npost factory_ law."\r\n\r\n"--and also what can be classified as vermin," Custis went on.\r\n\r\nStump closed his mouth with a snap.\r\n\r\n"Here, that s\'posed to be some kind of slam at me, Custis? By God, come\r\nelection time...."\r\n\r\nAbove, the door opened again. A tall man in a leather jacket stepped\r\nout, stood looking down. The crowd pressed back. Senator Custis and\r\nthe reporter moved aside. The newcomer came down the steps slowly. He\r\ncarried Cecil Stump\'s nickel-plated .44 in his hand.\r\n\r\nStanding alone now, Stump watched him.\r\n\r\n"Here," he said. His voice carried a sudden note of strain. 

"Who\'re\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\nThe man reached the foot of the steps, raised the revolver and cocked\r\nit with a thumb.\r\n\r\n"I\'m the new exterminator," he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


I don\'t\r\nwant to give you the impression that peanuts are in short supply here,\r\nor that our economy is in the fix of having to import them sidewise.\r\nWhat I\'m trying to convey is that, if you\'re one of the rare ones\r\nfunctionally equipped to do the side-shuffle, you ought to be well\r\npaid for it--in any coin.\r\n\r\nThat\'s what I told Krasnow. And he wasn\'t after peanuts. "I\'ll do it,"\r\nI said, "if you\'ll make it worth my while."\r\n\r\n"I\'d hardly expect you to do it for nothing," he replied\r\nreproachfully. "How much do you want?"\r\n\r\nI told him. The amount shook him up, but only briefly.\r\n\r\n"Okay," he said grudgingly. "I suppose I\'ll have to give it to you.\r\nBut the stuff had better be good."\r\n\r\n"Oh, it is," I assured him. "And you don\'t have to be afraid, because\r\nI couldn\'t possibly skip with the loot. I\'ll have to travel naked. I\r\ncan\'t get there with so much as a sandal on one foot or a filling in a\r\nsingle tooth. 

Fortunately, my teeth are perfect."\r\n\r\nSweat poured off Krasnow\'s florid face as he worked the combination of\r\nhis office safe. His fat jowls quivered unhappily around his cigar\r\nwhile he counted out the bills. Ten per cent was cash in advance, and\r\nthe rest went into a bank account in my name. I paid off a batch of\r\nbills, then stripped and did my off-to-Buffalo.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Honest" John Krasnow was a crooked District Attorney who wanted to be\r\nGovernor and then President. He had the Machine, but he didn\'t have\r\nthe People. 

And, because he needed the People, he needed me. I had\r\nbeen to this other dimension--the one on the farthest branch of the\r\ntime-tree--and I could give him what he wanted.\r\n\r\nKrasnow found out about it after I was hauled up in front of him on a\r\ncheck-kiting charge. I\'d had something of a reputation before I got\r\ninto difficulties and, in trying to live up to the reputation, I had\r\ndone some plain and fancy financing. Nothing that fifteen to twenty\r\ngrand wouldn\'t have fixed--but while I scrounged around, trying to get\r\ncash, I kited a few checks. They pyramided me right into the D.A.\'s\r\noffice, where Krasnow was properly sympathetic.\r\n\r\n"How," he asked, "could a man of your standing in the scientific world\r\nstoop so low?" It developed into quite a lecture and, even coming from\r\nKrasnow, it made me feel pretty low.\r\n\r\nSo I began explaining. I told him where I was born, and where I went\r\nto school, and where I had taken my sabbaticals--including this other\r\ndimension. And Krasnow believed me. I can\'t account for it, except\r\npossibly because he knew he was a crook and knew I wasn\'t\r\none--exactly. Anyway, he believed me, and we made the deal and I did\r\nthe side-shuffle, as agreed.\r\n\r\nThe journey to that other dimension is not a pleasant one. It does\r\ndisturbing things to the stomach, and you see everything thin and\r\nelongated, as if you\'re sitting too far to the side in a movie\r\ntheater.\r\n\r\nI got there, however, and waited for the hiccups to subside. _Hiccupi\r\nlaterali_, I had called them when I considered writing an article for\r\nthe _Medical Journal_ after my first trip. With the hiccupi gone, I\r\nstole some clothing--which was one of the riskiest parts of the\r\nprogram--and waited for morning. I didn\'t have any money, of course,\r\nso I had to hitchhike into town.\r\n\r\nI could have stolen myself a better fit, but people aren\'t\r\nclothes-conscious in that dimension. They\'re more interested in what\r\nyou are and what you can do. 

The driver of the car that gave me a lift\r\nasked, "And what is your field of endeavor?"\r\n\r\nI told him, "I am able to eliminate the long wait in ivory production\r\nby accelerating the growth cycle of elephants."\r\n\r\nHe was deeply impressed and tipped me handsomely. I was less impressed\r\nwith his talent for growing cobless corn, and therefore had to return\r\nonly a small part of the sum he gave me.\r\n\r\nThe world of this dimension had developed some remarkable parallels to\r\nEarth. I mean our Earth, which falls into what I have designated\r\nTimeline One Point One, since it\'s the Earth with which I am most\r\nfamiliar. Every other world that has a language calls itself Earth,\r\ntoo. I had to visit briefly hundreds of the lateral worlds, hovering\r\nover primordial swamps, limitless oceans, insect kingdoms and\r\nradioactive planetoids, before I found the one that was truly\r\nparallel.\r\n\r\nIt existed in Timeline Seventeen Point Zero Eight, and it had\r\nrefrigerators, platinum blondes, automobiles, airplanes, apple pie,\r\ntabloids, television, scotch and soda--just about everything we think\r\nmakes life worthwhile. But it had its little differences, which was\r\nonly to be expected in a timeline where the bionomics could create a\r\nnew world each time someone changed his mind.\r\n\r\nThus, the cobless-corn man was driving what looked to me like a\r\nChevrolet, but which was a Morton in his world. He let me off near a\r\ndowntown restaurant where, thanks to our little exchange of talent\r\ntalk, I had enough money for breakfast. It was considered unethical to\r\nswap talent talk outside the limits of certain rigidly defined groups,\r\nso I didn\'t try to out-impress the waitress.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFed, and filling my stolen clothes a bit better, I walked to the\r\nrecorder\'s office and spent the rest of the morning looking up old\r\ndocuments. There was nothing there for Krasnow, as I had expected. But\r\nfor me there was a very pretty file clerk. Talking to her, I verified\r\nmy impression that human instincts and relationships were much the\r\nsame in this dimension as in my own--except in the one basic respect\r\nthat interested Krasnow, of course.\r\n\r\nThe file clerk and I lunched together and then I spent the afternoon\r\nin the library. But I didn\'t find anything there, either, and then I\r\nhad dinner with her. She said her name was Julie. I told her mine was\r\nHeck, for Hector, which it is. She thought this was "awfully cute" and\r\nwe got along fine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nJulie had a delightful apartment and a matching sense of hospitality.\r\nThe following day, when she went to work, I stayed home and washed the\r\ndishes and made the bed and used the telephone.\r\n\r\nI ran up quite a bill with my long-distance calls, but I found out\r\nwhat I needed to know. I impressed a lot of people with my elephant\r\nstory and pretended to be impressed hardly at all with what they told\r\nme they did--although often I was, very much.\r\n\r\nThe trouble with these people is that they no longer know how to lie,\r\nif that can be listed as trouble. I don\'t think it can. 

Neither did\r\nKrasnow, obviously. He\'d never have sent me off on my expensive\r\nside-trip if he had.\r\n\r\nOf course, Krasnow looked at it objectively. What he wanted from\r\nTimeline Seventeen Point Zero Eight was not for himself. 

It was for\r\neverybody else. He wanted the formula for the truth gas these people\r\nhad developed long ago and loosed upon their world to put a stop to\r\nwars.\r\n\r\nThey had been in a bad way, although no worse than the sort of problem\r\nwe were up against. Their trans-ocean squabbles and power politics\r\nseemed to have settled into a pattern of a war or two per generation.\r\nJust like us. Hence, the man who invented the truth gas became a\r\nglobal hero, after a certain amount of cynicism and skepticism. All\r\nthe doubts vanished, naturally, once the gas got to working. And so\r\ndid war.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nYou can\'t do much plotting and scheming if, every time you open your\r\nmouth to tell a lie, you stammer, sweat, turn red and gasp for breath.\r\nIt\'s a dead giveaway. Nobody tries it more than once.\r\n\r\nOne or two men had tried to nullify the gas or work out a local\r\nantidote, either as a pure research project or through power-madness.\r\nBut, because they had had to state their purposes as soon as they\r\nthought of them, they were put away. Neat. Very neat.\r\n\r\nWhat I wanted was the formula for the truth gas. Its location wasn\'t\r\nexactly a secret in this land of complete candor, but it wasn\'t writ\r\nlarge on any wall for all to see, either. They kept it in their\r\ncapital--located about where our Omaha is--on file among the Vital\r\nStatistics.\r\n\r\nI took a superjet out there.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI had no trouble posing as a historian entitled to the facts. The gas\r\ndidn\'t work on me, you see, because it was adjusted to the physiology\r\nof that timeline. There was just enough difference between us for it\r\nnot to make me stick to the truth.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll write out the formula for you," I was told obligingly. "But\r\nyou\'ll have to sign the usual statement."\r\n\r\n"Of course," I said. 

"Which one is that?"\r\n\r\n"The one that says you won\'t publish it, and will destroy your copy\r\nwhen it has served your research purpose, without letting anyone else\r\nsee it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, _that_ statement," I said.\r\n\r\nI signed freely, told my elephant story and departed in an aura of\r\ngood will.\r\n\r\nThe jet got me back that same evening. Julie fixed me up a snack, and\r\nwe discussed how pretty she was and how nice I was.\r\n\r\nI had everything Krasnow wanted now. I felt pretty good about it,\r\nbecause there was nobody else who could have done the job for him, and\r\nbecause it wasn\'t spying, really. Earth One Point One on the Timeline\r\nis world enough for Krasnow, I\'m sure. Besides, dimensions don\'t have\r\nwars with one another. Too many things can go wrong.\r\n\r\nJulie was lovely and I hated to leave the next morning, but it was my\r\njob. I told her, "I\'m afraid I have to leave town for a bit, dear, but\r\nI\'ll be back very soon. 

Business, you know."\r\n\r\nBeing a Seventeen Point Zero Eight girl, Julie had no reason to doubt\r\nme. "Make it _very_ soon," she whispered, her lips close to my ear.\r\n\r\nSo I came back, and now Krasnow has what he wants. He\'s delighted, as\r\nhe should be. 

I\'ve made up the gas for him and adjusted the formula so\r\nthat it will work on people of our timeline. It\'s high-power stuff and\r\na little will go a long way. I also made up an antidote for him. This\r\nwas easy, since I could work on it without feeling any compulsion to\r\ntell everybody what I was doing and why.\r\n\r\nKrasnow plans to release the truth gas just before the state\r\nconvention. He\'ll be nominated, of course, and after November he\'ll\r\nbe Governor. With everyone else compelled to tell the truth, it should\r\nbe a cinch for him. He\'s a patient man, Honest John Krasnow is, and\r\nhe\'s willing to wait four years for the Presidency.\r\n\r\nI ought to be happy too. With the money Krasnow gave me, I\'ve been\r\nliving in the style to which I\'ve always wanted to be accustomed. He\r\nhas offered me a place on his staff and, somewhat superfluously, the\r\nuse of his antidote. Naturally, the reason he was so magnanimous was\r\nthat he doesn\'t want anyone else around who knows his gimmick and\r\nmight have to tell the truth about it.\r\n\r\nBut I have had enough of this dimension now--now that Krasnow has what\r\nI promised him. He\'s going to use it tomorrow. And if I know Honest\r\nJohn--and I do--not even the Presidency will be big enough for him.\r\n\r\nSo I\'m going back to Julie.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are some obvious questions in your mind, I know, such as: Why\r\ndid I get the formula for Krasnow, knowing there was no way for him to\r\nprosecute me while I was in Julie\'s dimension? And what made me come\r\nback?\r\n\r\nIn short--what was in it for me?\r\n\r\nLet\'s call it research. Krasnow is a big-time operator; I\'ve always\r\nbeen, you might say, in the peanut end of the game. He had a great\r\ndeal to teach me and I, I\'m happy to say, was an apt pupil. You might\r\nspeculate on what\'s in it for you, because, if you ask me, anybody who\r\ncan do the side-shuffle should do it before Krasnow becomes President.\r\n\r\nHowever, don\'t go to Seventeen Point Zero Eight unless you want to\r\nswap one Krasnow for another. The fact is that I\'ve learned I can be\r\none in Julie\'s dimension. After all, their formula doesn\'t work on\r\nme--but I can assure you that it will work on you.\r\n\r\nAnd that elephant story I told on my last visit is, as I\'ve indicated,\r\nin the peanut category. All Krasnow has is a country. I\'ll have a\r\nwhole world.\r\n\r\nThere\'s nothing like study under a master, is there?\r\n\r\nI should be back to Julie by midnight if I start now.\r\n\r\n--RICHARD WILSON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n


"More than a\r\nmile long, and wider than hell." 

He waved his hands expansively. "She\'s\r\nnever touched down on Earth, you know. Never will. Too big for that.\r\nThey built her on the moon. 

The cost? Well ..."\r\n\r\nSwiveling his chair around, Heselton slowly surveyed the ship\'s control\r\nroom with a small, satisfied smile. The two pilots sitting far forward,\r\nalmost hidden by their banks of instruments, the radar operators idly\r\nwatching their scopes, the three flight engineers sitting intently at\r\ntheir enormous control consoles, and, just behind, the radio shack--its\r\nclosed door undoubtedly hiding a game of cards. For weeks now, as Big\r\nJoe moved across the galaxy\'s uncharted fringe, the radio bands had been\r\ncompletely dead, except, of course, for the usual star static hissing\r\nand burbling in the background.\r\n\r\nTurning back again to his navigator, Heselton smiled modestly and noted\r\nthat Big Joe was undisputedly the largest, most powerful, most feared,\r\nand most effective spaceship in the known universe.\r\n\r\nAs always, Rogers nodded agreement. The fact that he\'d heard it a\r\nhundred times didn\'t make it any less true. Big Joe, armed with every\r\nweapon known to Terran technology, was literally the battleship to end\r\nall battleships. Ending battleships--and battles--was, in fact, her job.\r\nAnd she did it well. For the first time, the galaxy was at peace.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith a relaxed sigh, Heselton leaned back to gaze at the stars and\r\ncontemplate the vastness of the universe, compared to which even Big Joe\r\nwas an insignificant dot.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Rogers, "time for another course check. I\'ll ..." He jumped\r\nback, barely avoiding the worried lieutenant who exploded upon them from\r\nthe radio shack.\r\n\r\n"A signal, sir! Damn close, on the VHF band, their transmission is\r\ncompletely overriding the background noise." He waved excitedly to\r\nsomeone in the radio shack and an overhead speaker came to life emitting\r\na distinct clacking-grunting sound. 

"It\'s audio of some sort, sir, but\r\nthere\'s lots more to the signal than that."\r\n\r\nIn one motion Heselton\'s chair snapped forward, his right fist hit the\r\nred emergency alert button on his desk, and his left snapped on the\r\nship\'s intercom. Lights dimmed momentarily as powerful emergency drive\r\nunits snapped into action, and the ship echoed with the sound of two\r\nthousand men running to battle stations.\r\n\r\n"Bridge to radar! Report."\r\n\r\n"Radar to bridge. All clear."\r\n\r\nHeselton stared incredulously at the intercom. "What?"\r\n\r\n"Radar to bridge, repeating. All clear. Admiral, we\'ve got two men on\r\nevery scope, there\'s nothing anywhere."\r\n\r\nA new voice cut in on the speaker. 

"Radio track to bridge."\r\n\r\nFrowning, Heselton answered. "Bridge. Come in radio track. We\'re\r\nlistening."\r\n\r\n"Sir," the crisp voice of the radio track section\'s commander had an\r\nexcited tinge. "Sir, Doppler calculations show that the source of those\r\nsignals is slowing down somewhere to our right. It\'s acting like a\r\nspaceship, sir, that\'s coming to a halt."\r\n\r\nThe admiral locked eyes with Rogers for a second, then shrugged. "Slow\r\nthe ship, and circle right. Radio track, can you keep me posted on the\r\nobject\'s position?"\r\n\r\n"No can do, sir. Doppler effect can\'t be used on a slow moving source.\r\nIt\'s still off to our right, but that\'s the best I can say."\r\n\r\n"Sir," another voice chimed in, "this is fire control. We\'ve got our\r\ndirectional antennas on the thing. It\'s either directly right or\r\ndirectly left of the ship, matching speed with us exactly."\r\n\r\n"_Either_ to our right or left?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s the best we can do, sir, without radar help."\r\n\r\n"Admiral, sir," the lieutenant who had first reported the signal came\r\nrunning back. "Judging from the frequency and strength, we think it\'s\r\nprobably less than a hundred miles away."\r\n\r\n"_Less_ than a hundr ..."\r\n\r\n"Of course, we can\'t be positive, sir."\r\n\r\nHeselton whirled back to the intercom. "Radar! That thing is practically\r\non our necks. What the hell\'s the matter with that equipment...?"\r\n\r\nThe radar commander\'s voice showed distinct signs of strain. "Can\'t help\r\nit, Admiral. The equipment is working perfectly. We\'ve tried the\r\ncomplete range of frequencies, twenty-five different sets are in\r\noperation, we\'re going blind looking. There is absolutely nothing,\r\nnothing at all."\r\n\r\nFor a moment the bridge was silent, except for the clacking-grunting\r\nfrom the overhead speaker which, if anything, sounded louder than\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n"It\'s tv, sir!" The radio lieutenant came running in again. "We\'ve\r\nunscrambled the image. 

Here!" The communications screen on Heselton\'s\r\ndesk glowed for a moment, then flashed into life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe figure was clearly alien, though startlingly humanoid--at least from\r\nthe waist up, which was all that showed in the screen. A large mouth and\r\nslightly bulging eyes gave it a somewhat jovial, frog-like demeanor.\r\nSeated at a desk similar to Heselton\'s, wearing a gaudy uniform\r\nprofusely strewn with a variety of insignia, it was obviously Heselton\'s\r\ncounterpart, the commander of an alien vessel.\r\n\r\n"Hmmm, looks like we\'ve contacted a new race. Let\'s return the call,\r\nLieutenant." A tiny red light glowed beneath a miniature camera on\r\nHeselton\'s desk and almost at once the alien\'s face registered obvious\r\nsatisfaction. It waved a six-fingered hand in an unorthodox, but\r\nfriendly, greeting.\r\n\r\nHeselton waved back.\r\n\r\nThe alien then pointed to his mouth, made several clacking-grunting\r\nsounds, and moved a hand on his desk. The scene switched to another\r\nalien standing in front of what looked like a blackboard, with a piece\r\nof chalk in his hand. The meaning was clear.\r\n\r\n"Lieutenant, have this transmission switched to the linguistics section.\r\nMaybe those guys can work some sort of language." The screen blanked\r\nout. Heselton leaned back, tense, obviously worried. Hesitantly, he\r\nreached out and touched a button on the intercom.\r\n\r\n"Astronomy."\r\n\r\n"Professor, there\'s a ship right next door somewhere that should stand\r\nout like King Kong in a kindergarten."\r\n\r\n"I know, Admiral. 

I\'ve been listening to the intercom. Our optical\r\nequipment isn\'t designed for close range work, but we\'ve been doing the\r\nbest we can, tried everything from infra-red through ultra-violet. If\r\nthere is a ship out there I\'m afraid it\'s invisible."\r\n\r\nBeads of sweat sprinkled Heselton\'s forehead. "This is bad, Rogers.\r\nMighty bad." Nervously, he walked across to the right of the bridge and\r\nstood, hands clasped behind his back, staring blankly out at blackness\r\nand the scattered stars. "I know there is a ship out there, and I know\r\nthat a ship simply can\'t be invisible, not to radar _and_ optics."\r\n\r\n"What makes you sure there is only one, sir?"\r\n\r\nHeselton cracked his fists together. "My God, Rogers, you\'re right!\r\nThere might be ..."\r\n\r\nThe intercom clacked. "This is fire control again, sir. I think we\'ve\r\ngot something on the radiation detectors."\r\n\r\n"Good work, what did you find?"\r\n\r\n"Slight radioactivity, typical of interstellar drive mechanisms,\r\nsomewhere off to our right. Can\'t tell exactly where, though."\r\n\r\n"How far away is it?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, sir."\r\n\r\nHeselton\'s hands dropped to his sides. 

"Thanks," he said, "for the\r\nhelp."\r\n\r\nHis desk tv flashed into life with a picture of the smiling alien\r\ncommander. "This is the linguistics section, Admiral. The aliens\r\nunderstand a fairly common galactic symbology, I believe we can\r\ntranslate simple messages for you now."\r\n\r\n"Ask him where the hell he is," Heselton snapped without thinking, then\r\ninstantly regretted it as the alien\'s face showed unmistakable surprise.\r\n\r\nThe alien\'s smile grew into an almost unbelievable grin. He turned\r\nsideways to speak to someone out of sight of the camera and suddenly\r\nburst into a series of roaring cackles. "He\'s laughing, sir." The\r\ntranslator commented unnecessarily.\r\n\r\nThe joke was strictly with the aliens. Heselton\'s face whitened in quick\r\nrealization. "Rogers! They _didn\'t know_ that we can\'t see them!

"\r\n\r\n"Look, sir." The navigator pointed to the tv screen and a brilliantly\r\nclear image of Big Joe shimmering against the galaxy, lit by millions of\r\nstars. Every missile port, even the military numerals along her nose\r\nwere clearly visible.\r\n\r\n"They\'re rubbing it in, Rogers. Showing us what we look like to them.

"\r\nHeselton\'s face was chalk. "They could blast Big Joe apart, piece by\r\npiece--the most powerful ship in the galaxy."\r\n\r\n"Maybe," said Rogers, "the second most powerful."\r\n\r\nWithout answering, Heselton turned and looked out again at empty space\r\nand millions of steady, unwinking stars. His mind formed an image of a\r\nhuge, ethereal spaceship, missile ports open, weapons aimed directly at\r\nBig Joe.\r\n\r\nThe speaker interrupted his nightmare. "This is fire control, Admiral.\r\nWith your permission I\'ll scatter a few C-bombs ..."\r\n\r\nHeselton leaped for the microphone. "Are you out of your mind? We\r\nhaven\'t the slightest idea of the forces that guy has. We might be in\r\nthe center of a whole blooming fleet. 

Ever think of that?"\r\n\r\nThe alien\'s face, still smirking, appeared again on the screen. "He\r\nsays," said the interpreter, "that he finds the presence of our armed\r\nship very annoying."\r\n\r\nHeselton knew what he had to do. "Tell him," he said, swallowing hard,\r\n"that we apologize. This part of the galaxy is strange to us."\r\n\r\n"He says he is contemplating blasting us out of the sky."\r\n\r\nHeselton said nothing, but he longed to reach out and throttle the\r\ngrinning, alien face.\r\n\r\n"However," the interpreter continued, "he will let us go safely if we\r\nleave immediately. He says to send an unarmed, diplomatic vessel next\r\ntime and maybe his people will talk to us."\r\n\r\n"Thank him for his kindness." Heselton\'s jaws clenched so tightly they\r\nached.\r\n\r\n"He says," said the interpreter, "to get the hell out."\r\n\r\nThe grinning face snapped off the screen, but the cackling laughter\r\ncontinued to reverberate in the control room until the radio shack\r\nfinally turned off the receiver.\r\n\r\n"Reverse course," the admiral ordered quietly. "Maximum drive."\r\n\r\nA thousand missile launchers, designed to disintegrate solar systems,\r\nwere deactivated, hundreds of gyros swung the mile-long ship end for end\r\nand stabilized her on a reverse course, drive units big enough to power\r\nseveral major cities whined into operation, anti-grav generators with\r\nthe strength to shift small planets counterbalanced the external\r\nacceleration, and the ship moved, away, with a speed approaching that of\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n"Well," muttered Heselton, "that\'s the very first time Big Joe has ever\r\nhad to retreat." As if it were his own personal failure, he walked\r\nslowly across the control room and down the corridor towards his cabin.\r\n\r\n"Admiral!" Lost in thought, Heselton barely heard the call.\r\n\r\n"Admiral, look!" Pausing at the door to his cabin, Heselton turned to\r\nface the ship\'s chief astronomer running up waving two large\r\nphotographs.\r\n\r\n"Look, sir," the professor gasped for breath. "We thought this was a\r\nspot on the negative, but one of the men got curious and enlarged it\r\nabout a hundred times." He held up one of the photos. It showed a small,\r\nfuzzy, but unmistakable spaceship. "No wonder we couldn\'t spot it with\r\nour instruments."\r\n\r\nHeselton snatched it out of his hand. 

"I see what you mean. This ship\r\nmust have been thousands of miles ..."\r\n\r\nThe professor shook his head. "No, sir. As a matter of fact, it was\r\nquite close by."\r\n\r\n"But ..."\r\n\r\n"We figure that the total length of the alien ship was roughly an inch\r\nand a half."\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Science Fiction Stories_\r\n    January 1960.

copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter her husband left her, Marigold filed a protection-request form\r\nand an availability form.\r\n\r\nShe did not do this immediately. She stayed up for the better part of\r\nthe night, hoping that he would come back. She could not bring herself\r\nto believe that he would really walk out on her and leave her available\r\nfor confiscation, or for the slavery pool. She also thought for quite a\r\nwhile about the possibility of somehow getting back to Earth, where she\r\nwould not be available for either.\r\n\r\nShe even went to the fantastic expense of televiewing there to talk\r\nwith her father and mother. They had been shocked and unfriendly. They\r\nhad said good-by with a finality which left little room for doubt as\r\nto what they thought of an Abandoned. They had never had one in their\r\nfamily, they had pointed out, neither of them, and they did not intend\r\nto have one in their family now. They had warned her that they intended\r\nto report the call to the Beta III Protection People.\r\n\r\nThis did not worry her much. The call almost certainly had been\r\nmonitored anyway. If they wanted to go to the considerable extra\r\nexpense of reporting it, in order to impress the Protection People with\r\ntheir loyalty, that was their own lookout. She understood that, now,\r\nshe had no family. She thought for a moment of going up-ramp to say\r\ngood-by to the children, but she knew that this would not help.\r\n\r\nBesides, it was illegal. They were no longer hers. She was an Abandoned.\r\n\r\nShe had never known what a tremendously harrowing experience\r\nfilling out an availability form could be. Name, age, Sector, race,\r\nsize-classification, beauty-index, fertility tests, personality scores,\r\naptitudes, psyche-rating and so on, and so on and so on. It was like\r\nundressing for an auction. The protection-request form was much\r\nsimpler, except for that one question: STATUS? Her hand shook almost\r\nuncontrollably as she wrote. _Abandoned._\r\n\r\nAfter that she did not know what to do. She had stood for nearly twenty\r\nminutes before the document file, listening, thinking desperately that\r\nhe would come back; that if she only waited a few minutes more he would\r\ncome back. She had made herself refreshment. She had sat with the\r\nfilled-out documents on her lap looking, from time to time, longingly\r\nat the entrance-ramp. But he had not come back. Finally, with a low\r\nmoaning sound, she had pushed the papers through the document file\r\nslot. She made the deadline by a scant three minutes.\r\n\r\nNow she knew that whatever else happened, the Protection People would\r\nbe there in the morning to pick up the children. She knew that it could\r\nshow in her favor if she were to get together the things they would\r\nneed to take with them. She could do this without seeing them and\r\nwithout talking to them, which was forbidden, but she could not bring\r\nherself to move.\r\n\r\nThe red light on the atmosphere control blinked warningly. Soon it\r\nwould let out a piercing scream. She was tempted to just let it.\r\nAnother of Clytia\'s suns must have set. She found that she had no sense\r\nof time. She had only the conviction that this would be her last night.\r\nThe last night that mattered to her at all. She wanted it to be a long\r\none. She had adjusted the atmoset. She had done this every night for\r\nthe seven years of their marriage. She began to sob uncontrollably. She\r\ntook her Status Married card and tore it in half. Then she held the\r\nhalves to her cheeks, her face wet and wretched between them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter a while she dialed the credit balance at her account. The figures\r\ncame back indicating a balance of 1300. He had left her quite a lot,\r\nwhen you considered that she had televiewed to Earth. She cried hard\r\nagain because she knew that he had not had to leave her anything at\r\nall. This made her certain (although she had known it already) that he\r\nwas not coming back.\r\n\r\nShe sat for quite a while studying the 1300 credit indicator.\r\nShe thought about using the money to buy a "pick-up-immediately\r\nadvertisement" on the omnivision. She was not sure of the rates, but\r\nshe thought the amount might even stretch to include a picture of\r\nher. 

She did not know. She did not even know if she would be expected\r\nto be nude or dressed for the picture. In the end, she decided not to\r\ntry an advertisement because there would not be time enough to employ\r\na reply-receiving address. All that would be accomplished would be to\r\nput every predator within miles in possession of the address of an\r\nAbandoned.\r\n\r\nShe took a dictator and said into it: "Dear children, I am leaving you\r\n1300 credit." She stopped then and shook her head. 

The tears made it\r\nso that she could not see, and she did not seem to be able to think.\r\n"Correction," she sobbed "Erase preceding. Dear Children of Yan, I make\r\nyou this gift of 1300. I am sure that your excellence will continue to\r\ndeserve much more than so small a gift. I send love with this small\r\ngift."\r\n\r\nThere could, of course, be no signature. An Abandoned had none.\r\n\r\nShe wished that she had not made the Earth call. There would have been\r\nmuch more to leave them then. He had left an astonishing amount in her\r\naccount. It was almost as though he had expected her to try to get\r\naway. She wished now that she had thought before taking action. There\r\nmight have been some way out.\r\n\r\nShe must have fallen asleep. The morning announcements came on as\r\nusual, waking her. She listened to the instructions for that day, and\r\nthe areas announced as forbidden. She made no effort, however, to\r\nindicate them on the day-map. She knew that, now, none of this applied\r\nto her.\r\n\r\nWith a very great effort she got up and shut off the children\'s ramp,\r\nso that they could not come down. She knew how much this would count in\r\nher favor. Then she began, as hurriedly as she could, to collect the\r\nthings they would need. She knew that she could not possibly get the\r\nthings together in time, and that so late an effort was more likely\r\nto count against her. She was not even close to finished when the\r\nannouncer flashed on.\r\n\r\nWithout asking who it was, she pressed the admitter. She was glad that\r\nthey had troubled to announce themselves.\r\n\r\nShe offered to go into another room while they removed the children.\r\nThey did not answer. One of them threw a sack over her. After a\r\nmoment, they took it off again and, rather apologetically, asked her\r\nto indicate where the child-ramp control was. She showed them. Their\r\nleader said that perhaps it would be all right for her to go into\r\nanother room if one of them went with her. When she saw the one chosen,\r\nshe put the sack back on herself. They laughed so hard at this that she\r\ndid not hear the children leave.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the children had been taken out, the leader came back and removed\r\nthe sack from around her. He asked if she had applied for protection.\r\nShe showed her card.\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s too bad," he said. "Do you have any refreshment left?"\r\n\r\nShe did not dare to lie to him. She showed him. He helped himself.\r\n\r\n"How about credits?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I gave it all to the ones who were here," she answered carefully. She\r\nfelt quick panic because she remembered that she had not so instructed\r\nher account. She had merely dictated it to the children. If he didn\'t\r\nfind out, though, that would be all right. The dictation was proof\r\nenough. But while she was still in this house, the credits were still\r\nin her control.\r\n\r\n"My credit indicator is here," she said, holding it out. He didn\'t take\r\nit.\r\n\r\n"Thanks for the refreshment," he said, getting up. 

"Make yourself\r\ncomfortable. 

The others will be here shortly."\r\n\r\nShe had nothing to do to make herself ready. She could not take\r\nanything from this house. Sometimes they let you wear what you were\r\nwearing, if it did not look as though you had put on your best things.\r\nThey did not always allow it, but they did sometimes. She remembered\r\nthat she had expressed strong disapproval of that to Yan, when they\r\nwere newly married. Then they both felt the same way about Abandoneds.\r\n\r\nShe indicated to her account how she wanted the 1300 disposed. Then she\r\nwaited. After a while, the Protection People came and led her out of\r\nthe house. They did not touch her or speak to her, they merely formed\r\na square in the center of which she walked. They led her to a records\r\nroom where an interview apparatus prepared a report on her.\r\n\r\n"You have filed availability papers?" it asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said, and gave the file number.\r\n\r\n"This is being checked," the apparatus said. "Have you any claims upon\r\nthe State?"\r\n\r\nShe came very close to mentioning the children. "None," she said in\r\na very small voice. It was difficult to remember that the interview\r\napparatus was not at all sensitive.\r\n\r\n"Have you credits in your possession?" the machine asked.\r\n\r\n"None," she said.\r\n\r\n"You are eligible for exclusion from the slave classification in what\r\nway?" That part of the recording seemed a bit worn. At least she did\r\nnot hear it very well.\r\n\r\n"In no way," she replied.\r\n\r\n"You will wait," said the machine, "until we have a report on the\r\navailability petition which you have filed. Please take a seat."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere were no seats. This was an older machine which they had not\r\nbothered to replace, or even to correct. She stood in horror as the\r\nlong minutes passed.\r\n\r\nHer number was finally called.\r\n\r\n"I am here," she said as the machine hummed, and she gave her number.\r\n\r\n"Your availability petition has been taken up," said the machine. "You\r\nare however to receive twenty-eight demerits for disposing of 6300\r\ncredit after having been abandoned. Do you accept?

"\r\n\r\n"I accept," she said. She was so dizzy that she could hardly stand. The\r\nmachine whirred and produced a reception-area card. She read it, and\r\nwalked as in a daze to the indicated reception area. Yan waited for her\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n"You look terrible," he said as he put his arm around her. "I\'m sorry.\r\nYou made me do this to you. 

I didn\'t want to. 

It\'s all over now, don\'t\r\ncry."\r\n\r\nShe thought that she was going to faint.\r\n\r\n"Thank you for receiving me," she said, according to the formula. "I am\r\nthe Abandoned of Yan, of the Estate...."\r\n\r\n"Stop it!" he said. "I know who you are! Stop it!"\r\n\r\n"Do you have children at your estate?" She asked it as one asks a\r\npolite, social question.\r\n\r\n"They\'ll be there when we get home," he said. "Don\'t do this. 

I didn\'t\r\nknow it would hurt that much. I wouldn\'t have done it if I had. They\'re\r\nyour children again now." He held her shoulders as he looked at her.\r\n\r\n"I came to you with twenty-eight demerits," she said. "Shall I work\r\nthem off before I come to your estate?"\r\n\r\n"Please, stop it!" 

he said. "They were paid when you accepted. I waited\r\nhere all night. No one else could have claimed you. 

Please, come on\r\nhome now?" He handed her a brand-new wife-status card.\r\n\r\n"Thank you," she said. "I shall try to deserve the opportunity which\r\nyou restore to me." He smiled as she recited the formula and took his\r\narm. Yet he did not look as if he felt like smiling.\r\n\r\n"Come home," he said. "Come home now. 

I\'ll not hurt you again." He led\r\nher back to their estate.\r\n\r\nThat night, feeling entirely justified, she abandoned him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Mommy," the children shouted. They ran to her and hugged her. They had\r\nmissed her, and had resented the disturbance in their routine. "Mommy!"\r\nThey danced and shouted, "Mommy! Mommy, Mommy!"\r\n\r\nWhen it was their bed time, he left her alone with them. He said good\r\nnight to them himself, kissed them and squeezed her shoulder. "It\'s\r\ngood to have you home again!" 

he said. His eyes filled with tears and\r\nhe hurried from the room.\r\n\r\n"Tell us a story, Mommy." It was the custom of the household.\r\n\r\nThere were tears in her eyes and her voice trembled a little, but she\r\nsaid in what seemed to them a perfect narrative style:\r\n\r\n"Once upon a time there were two very good and loving children who\r\nfound that it was their duty to denounce their father to the state and\r\nto see him publicly flogged to death. You must listen very carefully to\r\nthis," she said, "both of you.\r\n\r\n"At first, they thought that this was a very sad duty...."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Finders, keepers, is an unwritten law. But the gadget Clark\r\naccidentally found had a special set of rules governing its use by\r\nwhom--and when!]\r\n\r\n\r\nRichard Clark loaded his shotgun. He glanced up the canyon, gray and\r\nmisty under a cold dawn sky. A cotton-tail darted from a nearby bush and\r\nbounced away. Clark\'s gunsights followed in a weaving line after his\r\nbobbing target. Before he could draw a bead, the rabbit vanished behind\r\na distant scrub oak. Clark stalked him quietly. He knew he\'d bag this\r\none without trouble, but any others around him would take cover at his\r\nfirst shot.\r\n\r\nHis boots crunched loudly on gravel. At the sound the rabbit sprang into\r\nthe open and zigzagged toward a thicket. Furious at his clumsiness,\r\nClark blasted away with both barrels. He charged up the canyon, fumbling\r\nin his parka for more shells, and crashed through dank high brush into a\r\nshadowy clearing. A soft rustling sound quickly faded.\r\n\r\n"Well, there he goes," Clark grumbled.\r\n\r\nSomething metallic glittered in a low, thorny shrub, and he bent down,\r\ncurious. From a black cord caught in its branches dangled a silvery\r\npocket flashlight. He smiled faintly as he pulled it loose. After months\r\nof testing and inspecting complicated electronic devices, he found\r\nsimple gadgets amusing. He pressed a button on one end and eyed a white\r\nknob on the other. When it didn\'t light up, he stuffed it in a pocket,\r\nfinishing reloading, and sighed, "At least I bagged something."\r\n\r\n"Quite true!" 

a voice shrilled behind him.\r\n\r\nClark whirled around and gasped in astonishment. Two squat dwarfish men\r\ncrouched at the far side of the clearing. When he swung up his 16 gauge,\r\ntwo lights flashed, and it slid out of his hands. He buckled dizzily\r\nwith weakness and nausea, but then an invisible force jolted him upright\r\nand motionless. He felt rigid as stone.\r\n\r\n"Who are you?" Clark called out hoarsely.\r\n\r\nThey approached, jabbering in a strange tongue. Bluish dawnlight seemed\r\nto tint their scrawny bare arms and legs a deeper, ghastly blue. From\r\nweazel-shaped heads bulged enormous dark eyes which stared at him\r\nunblinkingly. As they waddled closer they puffed under the weight of\r\nheavy belts sagging with rows of odd, translucent instruments. One\r\ncreature wore ear-phones. The other, his bald head sunken between his\r\nshoulders, opened a round, moist, pink-rimmed mouth and bowed stiffly.\r\n\r\n"Forgive us, please," he piped. "My biologist friend has broken\r\nregulations."\r\n\r\n"Who are you?" Clark choked again.\r\n\r\nThe bald one\'s eyes closed and his belly quivered with high, tremulous\r\nlaughter. "Tell him, Ursi!

"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t blame me!" the one called Ursi squeaked, then pointed a claw-like\r\nfinger at a glowing disc in his belt. "Interference disturbed the\r\nscanner scope. I didn\'t see him until he fired!

"\r\n\r\nBaldy chuckled. "He was after food, not your ugly hide. But in your\r\nunseemly haste to escape, you dropped a valuable tool. A very careless\r\nblunder. And now instead of mold specimens, you\'ve collected a human. I\r\nknew this expedition would prove interesting."\r\n\r\n"We have to dispose of him!" Ursi shrieked and waved a black tube at\r\nClark menacingly.\r\n\r\n"You\'d kill him to recover your tool?" Baldy\'s nose twitched. "Remember\r\nwe prepare separate reports for the Council. Don\'t expect me to aid in\r\nbreaking the law."\r\n\r\nUrsi was painfully silent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBaldy seemed to relish his companion\'s distress. "You realize, Ursi,\r\nyou\'re responsible for this illegal contact? Also may I remind you that\r\nthe Law reads in part: On pain of death, no human shall be molested,\r\ncoerced or in any way injured by an expeditionary member\'s overt\r\naction."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t we bargain with him?" Ursi asked irritably.\r\n\r\n"Why, of course. Offer him our ship or your life," Baldy said.\r\n\r\nUrsi scowled. "If we take the tool and induce amnesia--"\r\n\r\n"The Law clearly prohibits that."\r\n\r\n"Let him keep it then," Ursi said angrily, rubbing a pointed blue chin.\r\n"I\'ll destroy its power principle first."\r\n\r\nBaldy sighed. "I repeat, this isn\'t a brainless Martian without legal\r\nrights. You abandoned it, a human found it. By merely picking up the\r\ntool, he establishes a salvage claim."\r\n\r\n"You call that law?" Ursi raged. "Stupid technicalities that settle one\r\nproblem to raise a worse one?"\r\n\r\n"Until the Council ratifies the amendment foreseeing this contingency,"\r\nBaldy explained, "you must abide by the original code."\r\n\r\n"But the tool\'s restricted!"\r\n\r\n"Restricted for thirty solar years according to the Probability Graphs,"\r\nmused Baldy. "You should have thought of that."\r\n\r\nUrsi\'s wide glittering eyes terrified Clark. But after an agonizing\r\nsilence, he heard Ursi whine fearfully, "We can\'t allow this! Can\'t you\r\nread his basic attitudes? He\'s suffering from the Korb power complex."\r\n\r\nBaldy shrugged. 

"Your misfortune, my dear Ursi."\r\n\r\nUrsi edged warily toward Clark as if he were a ferocious but chained\r\nbeast. "Your nation is a member of the Western Alliance?"\r\n\r\nBewildered, Clark cleared his throat. "Yes."\r\n\r\n"You have atomic weapons you intend using against your enemy--against\r\nthe Eastern Empire?"\r\n\r\n"If they attack us," Clark muttered nervously.\r\n\r\nUrsi shot an accusing look at Baldy who frowned. "They\'re vicious little\r\nchildren!" 

Ursi ranted. "The decision placing the tool on the restricted\r\nlist is perfectly justified. We made no effort to hinder their atomic\r\nresearches. But in the case of this tool.... They have the ingenuity to\r\ncombine it with atomic bombs! If he returns with it, he\'ll wreck a\r\nthousand years of human culture!"\r\n\r\nUrsi\'s excited words puzzled Clark who was overcoming his early shock.\r\nBut the cylinder in his pocket was still more baffling. What was it?\r\nWhat terrible power did it control?\r\n\r\n"Spare your world suffering." Ursi warned. "Surrender it to me.

"\r\n\r\nClark considered. Sheltered by their "Law," he knew he could make a free\r\ndecision. The thing was powerful. But they claimed it was exceedingly\r\ndangerous, and they seemed wiser, far wiser, than men. The mysterious\r\nforce still binding him and their hints of "restrictions" on human\r\nprogress convinced him of that. Still, possession was nine-tenths of any\r\nlaw.... He calculated nervously.\r\n\r\n"Well?" Ursi shrilled. "Your hands are now free to move."\r\n\r\nObediently Clark groped in his pocket. When his fingertips touched the\r\ncool metal, the thrill of possessing immense power overwhelmed him. He\r\nsputtered, "It\'s mine--I won\'t misuse it!"\r\n\r\nBaldy convulsed with laughter. Ursi jabbered fiercely, but Baldy raised\r\na thin claw. He spoke softly, and Ursi\'s eyes brightened. Ursi nodded,\r\nbut whatever he had agreed to still left him looking doubtful and\r\nuncertain.\r\n\r\nBaldy smiled warmly. "Keep it," he said, "and keep your promise. Ursi\r\ndoesn\'t trust you, but I do. I know you won\'t abuse this power."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nClark felt his body freeze rigid as a statue again. They pushed their\r\nway out of the clearing and disappeared. Overhead a bird chirped in\r\nloneliness, and the sky slowly turned pearly hued as the paralysis left\r\nhim. Flexing his muscles, he shook his head. The creepy little men were\r\nall part of a crazy hallucination. His mad rabbit hunt and the deafening\r\nroar of his gunfire had temporarily unhinged his mind.\r\n\r\nA low humming sound interrupted his moody pondering. Suddenly he reeled\r\nas the ground shuddered beneath him and he staggered blindly in pitch\r\ndarkness. He opened his eyes to look around, dazed. His shotgun was\r\nmissing, but the shiny cylinder was clutched tightly in his hand.\r\n\r\nClark trembled as he examined it. Along its length were etched a row of\r\nqueer symbols. Probably directions for its operation or servicing, he\r\ndecided. He aimed the knob at some rocks a few yards away and pressed\r\nthe button. But they didn\'t explode or disintegrate under a lethal\r\n"ray." Then discovering that a narrow center section of the cylinder\r\nrevolved by slow, even degrees, he tried again impatiently.\r\n\r\nA loud clatter made him look up, gaping. A cluster of rocks hung\r\nmotionless in the air. When his finger lifted, they fell to earth. The\r\nmechanism neutralized gravitational pull--objects could float!\r\n\r\nBreathing excitedly, Clark twisted the center section further. The\r\nstones shot up into the sky and disappeared. Quickly he adjusted the\r\nmechanism\'s control and brought them flashing back. He stared at the\r\ncylinder in unbelieving awe. Power men dreamed of surged inside it like\r\nan eager magic genie.\r\n\r\nHe experimented carefully, floating the rocks at different angles and\r\nthen hurtling them skyward. When he cut off the strange power, they\r\ncrashed heavily to the ground. The possibilities were tremendous! And\r\naside from the natural hazards of collision, how could it imperil\r\nmankind? Then as a thin cloud of dust billowed up from the fallen rocks,\r\na vision of its war potential burst upon him. 

Clumsy, costly rockets\r\nwith a single payload were obsolete. Atomic bombs could be showered\r\nalmost instantly on an enemy.\r\n\r\n_I know you won\'t abuse this power!_\r\n\r\nClark recalled Baldy\'s hopeful, trusting words and grinned. No, he\r\nwouldn\'t abuse it. He realized the aliens had not understated its\r\ndeadliness. No matter how the military pressed him, he wouldn\'t permit\r\nits use for mass bombings in the coming war. Not unless the enemy really\r\nthreatened to overrun the world...\r\n\r\nHe left the clearing and headed down the canyon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Clark reached the mouth of the canyon, he frowned. Out on a green\r\nmeadow a farmer drove a tractor, busily plowing deep furrows for a new\r\ncrop. 

A trim ranch house in the distance gleamed in the morning\r\nsunlight. Funny. Earlier, when he had crossed the field, he hadn\'t\r\nnoticed a sign of civilization. But it had been nearly dark then.\r\n\r\nHe strolled casually down to a rude stone wall and watched the tractor\r\nchurn toward him. The farmer waved. He jolted to a halt, cut the engine\r\nand wiped a red bandana over his wrinkled, sweating face. Clark glanced\r\ndown at his own shabby clothes and rubbed a rough, bristly chin. If he\r\nlooked like a bum, his brief demonstration would seem all the more\r\namazing.\r\n\r\n"Pretty hot work, eh?" Clark greeted him.\r\n\r\n"Yep," the old farmer nodded as he drank from a canteen. Clark grinned.\r\nHistory would record this man as the first person to actually witness a\r\ndegravitator at work. Clark studied the unplowed side of the meadow,\r\nthen pointed at a large, half-buried boulder.\r\n\r\n"You have a little work there, mister. I think a Clark Farm Helper will\r\ndo the trick."\r\n\r\nThe farmer gave him a puzzled look. Clark calmly beamed the rock. At\r\nfirst it strained up and down, but finally wrenched free. He floated it\r\nup in a slow arc, then deliberately dropped it with a heavy thud. Clark\r\nchuckled as the farmer tried to hide his astonishment with a poker face.\r\n\r\n"That for sale?" he asked shrewdly.\r\n\r\nClark laughed heartily. 

"Not this one. I\'ll make a fortune manufacturing\r\nthese little babies!"\r\n\r\n"How do you figure that?"\r\n\r\nClark frowned at the farmer\'s indifference. "Can\'t you see its\r\npossibilities? I just showed you!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s no good for farm work," the farmer said, reaching under his\r\ntractor seat. He raised what resembled a snub-nosed automatic. 

"This\r\nhere\'s a real beauty. 

Had this general purpose degrav for two years and\r\nno trouble yet."\r\n\r\nHe squeezed the trigger and the boulder skimmed across the field.\r\n\r\n"That looks like an old Harley single-drive you got there," the farmer\r\nsaid. "What\'dya do? 

Recondition it and pep up the atomic pile?"\r\n\r\nStunned, Clark swallowed hard. The old farmer leaned over his wheel in\r\ncuriosity. "Those old timers are pretty scarce. I remember when the\r\nfirst model came out about twenty years ago, just after the war ended."\r\n\r\n"After the war?" Clark stammered.\r\n\r\nHis mind spun in dizzy, sickening whirls. Degravitators were commonplace\r\nfarm tools! Where was he? Then suddenly he knew the meaning of his\r\nstrange black-out and Baldy\'s sly words. _I know you won\'t abuse this\r\npower._ How could he? Their superscience had catapulted him past the war\r\nyears into the future.\r\n\r\nThe old farmer said gently, "Tell you what, son, the wife\'s been nagging\r\nme for a pocket degrav to move furniture around the house. I\'ll give you\r\na fiver for it and a square meal. 

You look kinda pale."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n


Change course and seek other areas. This warning\r\nis being broadcast upon wavelengths available to you and in language\r\ntranslatable by you in accordance with Interstellar Code...." Murphy\r\nswitched it off and looked at his crew of two.\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\nForsyth grinned at him. 

"The hell with them! We\'ve heard that from\r\nevery race in the solar system--one way or another. I say we land."\r\n\r\nJamison shrugged. "Put \'er down anywhere. 

Makes no difference to me."\r\nHis scarred lips tightened.\r\n\r\n"Okay," Murph switched the set back on. The same record was playing,\r\nmonotonously.\r\n\r\n"Load up with combat equipment, boys. We\'re going in."\r\n\r\nThe deadly silver needle tightened the spiral course around the planet,\r\nand above Murph the speaker crackled again and went dead.\r\n\r\n"Guess they got tired of playing that record," he muttered.\r\n\r\nAnother crackling and the mechanism blared again.\r\n\r\n"... we see you intend disregarding our warning. In accordance with\r\nInterstellar Code, it is only fair to warn you...." It clicked off\r\nabruptly as Murph jabbed at the switch. No use listening to this\r\noutworld nonsense--he\'d heard it all before and lived through it.\r\n\r\n"Where\'s the rest of the fleet?" He threw the question out generally.\r\n\r\n"Nine hours behind," Jamison said. "We blast in. 

They follow us." The\r\nthree men were silent as they scanned the radar screen. They whined\r\nabove a land mass and Murph juggled the controls and the ship swooped\r\nupward, then settled slowly, riding on the jets. While they waited for\r\nthe ground around them to cool, the men climbed into combat gear. The\r\nradar scanned the military hemisphere available and Murph casually\r\nflipped the radio switch again.\r\n\r\n"... have disregarded our warning," the voice said, insistently. "In\r\naccordance with the Interstellar Code, we can not now be further\r\nresponsible...." It croaked into silence as Murph slammed the switch\r\nclosed again.\r\n\r\n"Nuts!" he said, buckling a belt around his waist.\r\n\r\n"Yeah," said Jamison. 

"The hell with them--whoever they are."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Forsyth--he was the navigator, "now, I\'m not so sure...."\r\n\r\n"Get dressed," Murph was in command, and he showed it. "We are going\r\nout."\r\n\r\n... There was an oddity about the voice, Murph thought, as he dressed.\r\nThe voice reminded him of his sweetheart, Sitra, back in Philly on\r\nearth: husky, throaty--and with the soft, vibrant purr of a happy\r\nkitten.\r\n\r\n... It reminded Forsyth of his son\'s tones, during the family farewell\r\nfor this expedition. A twinge of concern tautened his body as he\r\nremembered: one never knew when--or if--crews returned from these grim\r\nexpansion campaigns of humanity.\r\n\r\n... Jamison had another impression. He remembered his days as a\r\nprofessional fighter and that last, rough brawl when he hadn\'t _quite_\r\nmade champion. It still rankled. The voice was that of his opponent,\r\nin the seventh round--just when Jamison\'s knees started to buckle. The\r\nsly, calculated insults in the clinches, intended to make him lose his\r\nhead. 

They had accomplished their purpose. He had charged in slugging,\r\nwhen he should have hung on--or run backward until his wind returned.\r\nFrom then on he became a has-been, working steadily downward, until the\r\nmanpower needs of humanity had offered an opportunity to pick another\r\ncareer. His scarred lips, remembering, were a tight line and his eyes\r\ncold and uncompromising.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey\'d finished dressing. Murph flipped on the radio again, grinning in\r\ncontempt. The voice still vibrated through the ether.\r\n\r\n"... that you blast off immediately or assume responsibility for\r\nthe consequences. Interstellar Code states that invaded peoples are\r\njustified in using any tactics...." It clicked off. Murph had been\r\nannoyed by the resemblance to Sitra\'s voice: perhaps he was homesick.\r\nJamison\'s lips vanished into a white line and Forsyth looked around,\r\nrabbit-eyed with astonishment, expecting to see his son emerge from\r\nthe piles of supplies and equipment. Self-conscious, none of them said\r\nanything.\r\n\r\n"Okay," said Murph, "Out we go."\r\n\r\nThe precision door swung open quietly and the three descended to the\r\nstill-smoking ground. Each set up his rapid fire electro-gun, covering\r\nthe entrance and then they sat back, waiting. Nothing happened, and\r\nMurph broke the tense silence.\r\n\r\n"Turn on the radio," he looked at Forsyth. "We can hear it from here.\r\nI\'ll man both guns."\r\n\r\nForsyth grunted and vanished into the ship. Murph heard the crackle\r\nas equipment warmed up, and listened to the voice of Sitra. Oddly\r\nenough, Jamison tensed as he heard the voice of the present champion,\r\nand Forsyth nearly cried as his son\'s tones came through the metallic\r\nspeaker. But all the voices said the same thing.\r\n\r\n"... subject to unprincipled attack to resist invasion of our homeland.\r\nThis is the last time this warning will be broadcast." The receiver\r\nclicked, then dropped into the monotonous hum of a radio on an unused\r\nbut still alert wavelength.\r\n\r\nForsyth returned and the three men sat, each back of an electro-gun,\r\nalert eyes scanning the alien landscape. From over a slight rise a mile\r\noff, a figure approached the ship. Murph blinked, doubting his senses,\r\nconfused, then his roar broke the silence of the strange world.\r\n\r\n"Sitra!" Just one word, but that\'s all he could do. She looked as she\r\nhad when he\'d left on this expedition, when they had said goodbye.\r\nSparkling with sequins in her dressing room, undulating with feathers\r\nin the right places, she walked toward him with the feline grace he\'d\r\nlearned to love.\r\n\r\n"Sitra!" he shouted again. Astonished, he deserted his position behind\r\nthe gun and started running across the plain. Gracefully, daintily,\r\nencountering difficulties because of her spiked heels on the rough\r\nterrain, she smiled bravely and hurried toward him.\r\n\r\nForsyth saw the approaching figure too. He tensed with disbelief and\r\nsurprise and then his voice rose excitedly.\r\n\r\n"Jimmy, _Jimmy!_" What was his boy doing _here_? Reason faded as he\r\nwatched his nine-year-old son stumbling toward the ship. He unfastened\r\nhis harness and slipped from behind the gun: _his_ boy on an alien\r\nplanet, confronting unknown dangers! He must--_must_--get him back to\r\nthe ship and the little ring of certainty behind the guns. Forsyth\r\nstarted across the level space, grateful that the towering hulk of\r\nMurph had recognized his boy and would, on this unknown world, help\r\nbring the kid back to comparative safety. In six hours, now, the\r\nfleet would be here. The boy could be sent home on one of the capital\r\nships....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBehind him Jamison watched the two figures running away. His face froze\r\ninto granite. 

Rage and resentment surged within him. Across the plain\r\nhe saw the man who had stolen, yes, _stolen_, the championship from\r\nhim. The fighter loped toward him casually, sneering and confident.\r\nJamison felt a surge like an electric shock across his shoulders. His\r\nteeth ground together and he could hear their roaring within his ears.\r\nDeliberately he moved from behind his gun, started at a fighter\'s dog\r\ntrot toward his opponent. It occurred to him that Murph and Forsyth\r\nwould beat him there. He was glad they were willing to help, but for\r\nthe sake of his own integrity he considered this _his_ fight.\r\n\r\nJamison ran swiftly then. He passed Forsyth and Murph, determined to be\r\nthe first to reach the one man he hated. He sprinted eagerly, sucking\r\nthe strange air chemicals of this world into his lungs. He was short\r\nof breath. Behind him he heard the heavy thudding of Murph plunging\r\nand plowing toward him, and in addition, the light but rapid steps of\r\nForsyth. By now he didn\'t care. He was confronting his opponent.\r\n\r\nDropping into a crouch, Jamison moved in. Feet wide, tense; there\r\nwould be no mistake, no error, this time. His fist lashed out and\r\nhis opponent fell on the strange and powdery dust of a strange world\r\nmillions of miles from their first fight.\r\n\r\nThe man started struggling up--and again flat-footed, tense, fists like\r\ncrunching sledge hammers, Jamison dove at him.\r\n\r\nAnd then it happened. Murph hit Jamison from the side. Raw and choking\r\nwith rage, Murph clubbed, groped, kicked, fouled, until the ex-fighter\r\nfell in the pale and strange dust. Murph\'s voice was hoarse and shaking:\r\n\r\n"Hit my woman, will you!" he screamed in rage.\r\n\r\nJamison tried to rally, but each time he moved Murph\'s fists slammed\r\nagainst his face and head.\r\n\r\nThere was a final crash as the back of his head struck against the\r\nrocks on the ground. Jamison lay in the dust on an alien planet and\r\nfrom behind his right ear gray and reddish matter oozed. He didn\'t move.\r\n\r\nMurph stood up. 

He looked again at Sitra. He was choked and tired,\r\nstanding there, and as he grasped for breath, Forsyth ran by him, ran\r\nup to her. Angrily he watched. Forsyth running up to _his_ woman! What\r\nwas wrong with these men? Murph saw Forsyth put his arms around Sitra,\r\nand say--meaninglessly to Murph--"Jimmy, Jimmy!"\r\n\r\nAgain a red rage filled Murph. He dove forward, smashed into Forsyth,\r\nand the navigator reeled backwards. As he fell back, his feet tangled\r\nin the scrubby vegetation of the planet, he reached toward his belt and\r\nhis electro-gun jerked free from the holster. He saw the bull shape of\r\nMurph over him, an enraged beast, and as he fell, the twin electrodes\r\nshot out an energy stream. Fear and hatred tensed his nerves, but\r\ndespite the emotion, he set the range right. The sparks arced together\r\njust in front of the great bulk of Murph. There was a crackling and\r\nthe smell of burning flesh, then a surprised look upon Murph\'s face.\r\nThe surprise turned to rage and the last thing Forsyth saw was Murph\r\nfalling down on him, his clothes and his chest burned away until the\r\nribs showed, animal rage welling from his lips.\r\n\r\nA figure stood fifty feet away and watched this drama. Murph, blood\r\ncoughing from his mouth and nose, the great muscles of his chest\r\nnothing but crisp burned meat, reached for Forsyth, picked him up,\r\nholding him over his head as an ape would a man, and slammed him again\r\nand again to the ground.\r\n\r\nThe final time Murph tried to lift Forsyth, his strength gave out. He\r\ndropped Forsyth\'s limp form, coughed in a final paroxysm, and fell\r\nbeside Forsyth and Jamison.\r\n\r\nThe figure which stood fifty feet away turned and walked leisurely\r\nback over the rise.\r\n\r\nNow, it was not a fighter, and it was not Jimmy, and it was not Sitra.\r\nIt was a denizen of the planet and it looked like no human.\r\n\r\nShortly thereafter the all-wave radio in the deadly, powerful silvery\r\nneedle standing serenely on the strange world blared again.\r\n\r\n"... in accordance with Interstellar Code we have asked that we not be\r\ninvaded and are warning you that according to Article 19, Section 3,\r\nfleets which invade a peaceful people become subject to unprincipled\r\nattack, even to the use of psychological weapons."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFive hours away the main fleet streaked toward the planet. 

The Admiral\r\nlooked at the tape reports from the scout ship and at transcripts of\r\nthe recorded warning.\r\n\r\n"Nuts!" he said. 

"We go in."\r\n\r\nHe felt an odd, intuitive twinge. The voice was so much like his\r\nmother\'s--and she hadn\'t been well when he\'d last seen her. Beside\r\nhim the Radioman busily, tersely, sent out landing instructions. 

He\r\nfelt irritable: the voice had sounded just like Peggy--that no-good,\r\ncheating!... He shrugged: just imagination.\r\n\r\nIn a diminishing spiral, the fleet swung around the planet while the\r\nAdmiral scanned the screen for a free landing site.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


Increased atmospheric pressure did funny things to his chest and\r\nstomach. And quick and sure-footed on Mars, he struggled constantly\r\nagainst the heavy gravity that made all his movements clumsy and\r\nuncoordinated.\r\n\r\nThe endless canyons of towering buildings, with their connecting\r\nSkywalks, oppressed and smothered him. Remembering the endless vistas of\r\n_rabbara_ fields beside a canal that was like an inland sea,\r\nhomesickness flooded over him.\r\n\r\nHe hated the people who stared at him with either open or hidden\r\namusement. His Aunt Bee, for instance, who looked him up and down with\r\nfrank disapproval and said loudly, "For Heavens sake, Helen! Take him to\r\na _good_ tailor and get those bones covered up!"\r\n\r\nWas it his fault he was six inches taller than Terran boys his age, and\r\nhad long, thin arms and legs? Or that his chest was abnormally developed\r\nto compensate for an oxygen-thin atmosphere? I\'d like to see _her_, he\r\nthought fiercely, out on the Flatlands; she\'d be gasping like a\r\ncanal-fish out of water.\r\n\r\nEven his parents, happily riding the social merry-go-round of Terra,\r\nafter eleven years in the Martian flatlands, didn\'t seem to understand\r\nhow he felt.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you _like_ Earth, Tommy?" queried his mother anxiously.\r\n\r\n"Oh ... it\'s all right, I guess."\r\n\r\n"... \'A nice place to visit\' ..." said his father sardonically.\r\n\r\n"... \'but I wouldn\'t live here if they gave me the place!\' ..." said his\r\nmother, and they both burst out laughing for no reason that Tommy could\r\nsee. Of course, they did that lots of times at home and Tommy laughed\r\nwith them just for the warm, secure feeling of belonging. This time he\r\ndidn\'t feel like laughing.\r\n\r\n"When _are_ we going home?" he repeated stubbornly.\r\n\r\nHis father pulled Tommy over in the crook of his arm and said gently,\r\n"Well, not right away, son. As a matter of fact, how would you like to\r\nstay here and go to school?"\r\n\r\nTommy pulled away and looked at him incredulously.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve _been_ to school!"\r\n\r\n"Well, yes," admitted his father. "But only to the colony schools. You\r\ndon\'t want to grow up and be an ignorant Martian sandfoot all your life,\r\ndo you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do! I _want_ to be a Martian sandfoot. And I want to go home\r\nwhere people don\'t _look_ at me and say, \'So this is your little\r\nMartian!\'"\r\n\r\nBenton, Sr., put his arm around Tommy\'s stiffly resistant shoulders.\r\n"Look here, old man," he said persuasively. "I thought you wanted to be\r\na space engineer. You can\'t do that without an education you know. And\r\nyour Aunt Bee will take good care of you."\r\n\r\nTommy faced him stubbornly. "I don\'t want to be any old spaceman. I want\r\nto be a sandfoot like old Pete. And I want to go home.

"\r\n\r\nHelen bit back a smile at the two earnest, stubborn faces so\r\nridiculously alike, and hastened to avert the gathering storm.\r\n\r\n"Now look, fellows. Tommy\'s career doesn\'t have to be decided in the\r\nnext five minutes ... after all, he\'s only ten. He can make up his mind\r\nlater on if he wants to be an engineer or a _rabbara_ farmer. 

Right now,\r\nhe\'s going to stay here and go to school ... _and_ I\'m staying with\r\nhim."\r\n\r\nResolutely avoiding both crestfallen faces, Helen, having shepherded\r\nTommy to bed, returned to the living room acutely conscious of Big Tom\'s\r\nbleak, hurt gaze at her back.\r\n\r\n"Helen, you\'re going to make a sissy out of the boy," he said at last.\r\n"There isn\'t any reason why he can\'t stay here at home with Bee."\r\n\r\nHelen turned to face him.\r\n\r\n"Earth _isn\'t_ home to Tommy. And your sister Bee told him he ought to\r\nbe out playing football with the boys instead of hanging around the\r\nhouse."\r\n\r\n"But she knows the doctor said he\'d have to take it easy for a year till\r\nhe was accustomed to the change in gravity and air-pressure," he\r\nanswered incredulously.\r\n\r\n"Exactly. She also asked me," Helen went on grimly, "if I thought he\'d\r\nbe less of a freak as he got older."\r\n\r\nTom Benton swore. "Bee always did have less sense than the average hen,"\r\nhe gritted. "My son a freak! Hell\'s-bells!"\r\n\r\nTommy, arriving at the hall door in time to hear the tail-end of the\r\nsentence, crept back to bed feeling numb and dazed. So even his father\r\nthought he was a freak.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe last few days before parting was one of strain for all of them. If\r\nTommy was unnaturally subdued, no one noticed it; his parents were not\r\nfeeling any great impulse toward gaiety either.\r\n\r\nThey all went dutifully sight-seeing as before; they saw the Zoo, and\r\nwent shopping on the Skywalks, and on the last day wound up at the great\r\nshowrooms of "Androids, Inc."\r\n\r\nTommy had hated them on sight; they were at once too human and too\r\ninhuman for comfort. 

The hotel was full of them, and most private homes\r\nhad at least one. Now they saw the great incubating vats, and the\r\nprocessing and finally the showroom where one of the finished products\r\nwas on display as a maid, sweeping and dusting.\r\n\r\n"There\'s one that\'s a dead-ringer for you, Helen. If you were a little\r\nbetter looking, that is." Tommy\'s dad pretended to compare them\r\njudicially. Helen laughed, but Tommy looked at him with a resentfulness.\r\nComparing his mother to an Android....\r\n\r\n"They say for a little extra you can get an exact resemblance. Maybe I\'d\r\nbetter have one fixed up like you to take back with me," Big Tom added\r\nteasingly. Then as Helen\'s face clouded over, "Oh, hon, you know I was\r\nonly kidding. Let\'s get out of here; this place gives me the\r\ncollywobbles. 

Besides, I\'ve got to pick up my watch."\r\n\r\nBut his mother\'s face was still unhappy and Tommy glowered sullenly at\r\nhis father\'s back all the way to the watch-shop.\r\n\r\nIt was a small shop, with an inconspicuous sign down in one corner of\r\nthe window that said only, "KRUMBEIN--watches," and was probably the\r\nmost famous shop of its kind in the world. Every spaceman landing on\r\nTerra left his watch to be checked by the dusty, little old man who was\r\nthe genius of the place. Tommy ranged wide-eyed about the clock and\r\nchronometer crammed interior. He stopped fascinated before the last\r\ncase. In it was a watch ... but, _what_ a watch! Besides the regulation\r\nTerran dial, it had a second smaller dial that registered the\r\ncorresponding time on Mars. Tommy\'s whole heart went out to it in an\r\necstasy of longing. 

He thought wistfully that if you could know what\r\ntime it was there, you could imagine what everyone was doing and it\r\nwouldn\'t seem so far away. 

Haltingly, he tried to explain.\r\n\r\n"Look, Mom," he said breathlessly. "It\'s almost five o\'clock at home.\r\nDouwie will be coming up to the barn to be fed. Gosh, do you suppose old\r\nPete will remember about her?"\r\n\r\nHis mother smiled at him reassuringly. "Of course he will, silly. Don\'t\r\nforget he was the one who caught and tamed her for you."\r\n\r\nTommy gulped as he thought of Douwie. Scarcely as tall as himself; the\r\nbig, rounded, mouselike ears, and the flat, cloven pads that could carry\r\nher so swiftly over the sandy Martian flatlands. One of the last\r\ndwindling herds of native Martian douwies, burden-carriers of a vanished\r\nrace, she had been Tommy\'s particular pride and joy for the last three\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nBehind him, Tommy heard his mother murmur under her breath, "Tom ... the\r\nwatch; _could_ we?"\r\n\r\nAnd his Dad regretfully, "It\'s a pretty expensive toy for a youngster,\r\nHelen. And even a _rabbara_ raiser\'s bank account has limits."\r\n\r\n"Of course, dear; it was silly of me." 

Helen smiled a little ruefully.\r\n"And if Mr. Krumbein has your watch ready, we _must_ go. Bee and some of\r\nher friends are coming over, and it\'s only a few hours \'till you ...\r\nleave."\r\n\r\nBig Tom squeezed her elbow gently, understandingly, as she blinked back\r\nquick tears. Trailing after them, Tommy saw the little by-play and his\r\nheart ached. The guilt-complex building up in him grew and deepened.\r\n\r\nHe knew he had only to say, "Look, I don\'t mind staying. Aunt Bee and I\r\nwill get along swell," and everything would be all right again. Then the\r\nterror of this new and complex world--as it would be without a familiar\r\nface--swept over him and kept him silent.\r\n\r\nHis overwrought feelings expressed themselves in a nervously rebelling\r\nstomach, culminating in a disgraceful moment over the nearest gutter.\r\nThe rest of the afternoon he spent in bed recuperating.\r\n\r\nIn the living room Aunt Bee spoke her mind in her usual, high-pitched\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n"It\'s disgraceful, Helen. A boy his age.... None of the _Bentons_ ever\r\nhad nerves."\r\n\r\nHis mother\'s reply was inaudible, but on the heels of his father\'s\r\ndeeper tones, Aunt Bee\'s voice rose in rasping indignation.\r\n\r\n"_Well!_ I never! And from my own brother, too. From now on don\'t come\r\nto me for help with your spoiled brat. Good-_bye_!"\r\n\r\nThe door slammed indignantly, his mother chuckled, and there was a\r\nspontaneous burst of laughter. Tommy relaxed and lay back happily.\r\nAnyway, that was the last of Aunt Bee!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next hour or two passed in a flurry of ringing phones, people coming\r\nand going, and last-minute words and reminders. Then suddenly it was\r\ntime to leave. Dad burst in for a last quick hug and a promise to send\r\nhim pictures of Douwie and her foal, due next month; Mother dropped a\r\nhasty kiss on his hair and promised to hurry back from the Spaceport.\r\nThen Tommy was alone, with a large, painful lump where his heart ought\r\nto be.\r\n\r\nThe only activity was the almost noiseless buzzing as the hotel android\r\nran the cleaner over the living room. Presently even that ceased, and\r\nTommy lay relaxed and inert, sleepily watching the curtains blow in and\r\nout at the open window. Thirty stories above the street the noises were\r\npleasantly muffled and remote, and his senses drifted aimlessly to and\r\nfro on the tides of half-sleep.\r\n\r\nDrowsily his mind wandered from the hotel\'s android servants ... to\r\nthe strictly utilitarian mechanical monstrosity at home, known\r\naffectionately as "Old John" ... to the android showroom where they\r\nhad seen the one that Dad said looked like Mother....\r\n\r\nHe jolted suddenly, sickeningly awake. Suppose, his mind whispered\r\ntreacherously, suppose that Dad _had_ ordered one to take Mom\'s\r\nplace ... not on Mars, but _here_ while she returned to Mars with him.\r\nSuppose that instead of Mom he discovered one of those _Things_ ... or\r\neven worse, suppose he went on from day to day not even knowing....\r\n\r\nIt was a bad five minutes; he was wet with perspiration when he lay back\r\non his pillows, a shaky smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. He\r\nhad a secret defense against the Terror. He giggled a little at the\r\nthought of what Aunt Bee would say if she knew.\r\n\r\nAnd what had brought him back from the edge of hysteria was the\r\ntriumphant knowledge that with the abnormally acute hearing bred in the\r\nthin atmosphere of Mars, no robot ever created could hide from him the\r\ninfinitesimal ticking of the electronic relays that gave it life. Secure\r\nat last, his overstrung nerves relaxed and he slid gratefully over the\r\nedge of sleep.\r\n\r\nHe woke abruptly, groping after some vaguely remembered sound. A soft\r\nclicking of heels down the hall.... Of course, his mother back from the\r\nSpaceport! Now she would be stopping at his door to see if he were\r\nasleep. He lay silently; through his eyelashes he could see her outlined\r\nin the soft light from the hall. She was coming in to see if he was\r\ntucked in. In a moment he would jump up and startle her with a hug, as\r\nshe leaned over him. 

In a moment....\r\n\r\nScreaming desperately, he was out of bed, backing heedlessly across the\r\nroom. He was still screaming as the low sill of the open window caught\r\nhim behind the knees and toppled him thirty stories to the street.\r\n\r\nAlone in the silent room, Helen Benton stood dazed, staring blindly at\r\nthe empty window.\r\n\r\nTommy\'s parting gift from his father slid from her hand and lay on the\r\ncarpet, still ticking gently.\r\n\r\nIt was 9:23 on Mars.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe End\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Imagination Stories of Science and\r\n    Fantasy_ July 1953.

In that way he escaped the annihilation along with one other\r\nman, revered old Dr. Garfield Gar, who was in the space station.\r\n\r\nRoy had backed well off in preparation for a mach ten dive on Kabul,\r\nwhich the enemy had lately taken over. He had one small omnibomb left\r\nin his racks and Kabul had seemed to be about the right size. But then\r\nthe destruction of Earth changed his plans.\r\n\r\nHe watched, expressionless, as the planet exploded. He shrugged. There\r\nwas nothing to do now but go see Dr. Gar.\r\n\r\nRoy\'s foescope clamored insistently and he tensed, thinking a\r\nspaceborne enemy was on him, but it was only a piece of exploding Earth\r\nstumbling by.\r\n\r\nDr. Gar was alone in the space station because all able-bodied men had\r\nbeen called to fight World War V. The governments of Earth, in a rare\r\nmoment of conscience during the Short Truce, had agreed that Dr. Gar,\r\nas the embodiment of all Earthly knowledge, should be protected from\r\nharm.\r\n\r\nPilot Officer Roy Vanjan didn\'t receive as warm a reception from old\r\nDr. Gar as he might have, considering that they were the only two\r\npeople left. The old man was combing his white beard with his fingers\r\nand didn\'t offer to shake hands.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Roy as he defused his bomb and secured his single-seater\r\nin the spacelock, "I guess it\'s all over."\r\n\r\n"Scarcely a historic statement," Dr. 

Gar said, "but it describes the\r\nsituation."\r\n\r\n"If you don\'t have anything for me to do I\'d just as soon have a drink.\r\nThey usually let me have a stiff one after I complete a mission."\r\n\r\nDr. Gar examined the hard young pilot from under shaggy white eyebrows.\r\n"I do have another mission for you but you can have a drink first.\r\nPeach brandy is all that\'s left."\r\n\r\n"That\'ll be fine," Roy said. 

"I was never particular."\r\n\r\n"Then you\'re my man," Dr. Gar said, giving him a deep look, "because I\r\nwant you to go back in time and destroy humanity."\r\n\r\n"Whatever you say." 

Roy\'s training showed. "But if I may comment,\r\nwouldn\'t that be superfluous? Except for you and me the human race is\r\nfinished. We\'ve achieved our objective." He spoke without irony.\r\n\r\n"Never _my_ objective."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not a scholar and I mean no offense," Roy said, "but I believe it\r\nwas the co-ordinated spatial theory you announced back in \'06 that made\r\nit possible."\r\n\r\n"Misapplication," Dr. Gar said wearily, not wanting to go into it\r\nfurther for such an audience. Though, he thought, he\'d never have\r\nanother. "Come into my study and have your brandy."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"I still don\'t understand," Roy said later. He reached tentatively for\r\nthe bottle. When the old man made no objection he poured a second stiff\r\none.\r\n\r\n"You want me to go back in time and wipe out all human life," Roy said.\r\n"I assume you\'ll tell me when and where. All right. 

That would destroy\r\nour ancestors and so we\'d cease to exist, too. Wouldn\'t it be simpler\r\nto kill ourselves now? That is, if you see no point to our further\r\nexistence.

"\r\n\r\nOld Dr. Gar watched the other remnant of Earthly life twirl the brandy\r\nin the goblet. He looked at the viewscreen. It showed a panorama of\r\nrock dust and steam where Earth had been.\r\n\r\n"You forget that we have annihilated everything," Dr. Gar said, gazing\r\npensively at the screen. "Mankind, the animals, plant life and the tiny\r\nthings that creep the earth or swim the waters. Your mission will be\r\nmore selective."\r\n\r\n"Selective? How?"\r\n\r\n"You\'ll destroy man, but the rest will live. They may evolve into\r\nsomething better."\r\n\r\n"If you say so, Doctor." Roy\'s devotion to duty was a well-worn path.\r\n"Assuming you have the machine and I can operate it."\r\n\r\n"The machine is merely an attachment. It will plug into the instrument\r\npanel of your spacecraft. It operates automatically."\r\n\r\n"Good enough. You always were a whiz at these things. How far back do I\r\ngo? And who do I kill?"\r\n\r\n"I want you to strafe the Ark, exercising care not to hurt any of the\r\nanimals," said old Dr. Garfield Gar.\r\n\r\n"Noah\'s Ark?" Pilot Officer Roy Vanjan asked. "You mean during the\r\nFlood?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'ve computed it exactly. You won\'t have to worry about getting\r\nthere at the wrong time."\r\n\r\n"You mean after the forty days\' rain, so I\'ll have good visibility.\r\nGood-o." He agreed readily and he\'d do as the doctor said, of course,\r\nbut he permitted a trace of skepticism in his inflection and a\r\nsearching look into his goblet.\r\n\r\n"No, not the fortieth day," Dr. Gar said, "but in what we are told was\r\nthe six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of\r\nthe month. The animals need dry land. I have it all figured out.

"\r\n\r\n"I hope so. I mean I\'m sure you have. You\'re the doctor, of course, but\r\nwasn\'t there some doubt about the accuracy of the old Book? I didn\'t\r\nknow you were a fundamentalist."\r\n\r\n"Am I not the repository of all human knowledge?" Dr. 

Gar asked. He was\r\nnot a bit angry with Roy Vanjan. "Am I not the last best hope? 

Has not\r\nall else failed us?"\r\n\r\n"Well, sure--"\r\n\r\n"Did not the Noahic Covenant, under which human government was\r\nestablished, fail? Has not Japhetic science been our undoing?"\r\n\r\nRoy looked lost. "I\'m no scholar, Doctor."\r\n\r\n"Agreed. But perhaps you\'ll grant that I am?" He looked with supreme\r\ncalm at the young pilot. "I\'m your new intelligence officer and you\'re\r\nmerely my striking arm. Help yourself to another brandy, son."\r\n\r\n"Maybe I\'d better not. I don\'t want to goof the mission."\r\n\r\n"There\'s time. You\'ll want some sleep first."\r\n\r\n"All right. I suppose I\'ll need a steady hand to murder Noah and the\r\nrest."\r\n\r\n"And Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, and Noah\'s wife," said Dr. Gar, "and\r\nthe three wives of his sons with them, as it was written. Especially\r\nJapheth. 

But not the animals, remember."\r\n\r\n"I understand that. If you think the Ten Commandments don\'t apply.\r\nWhichever one of them it was."\r\n\r\n"They were an element of the Mosaic Covenant. It, too, failed. Perhaps\r\nthe Garic Covenant, if I may be so vain, will endure."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe waters covered the Earth.\r\n\r\nA moment ago, before he activated the attachment, Pilot Officer Roy\r\nVanjan\'s spacecraft had been plunging towards the vortex of a ragged\r\nball of dust and vapor, the destroyed Earth of World War V. Now, in the\r\nAdamic Year 601 (or was it the Edenic?--he couldn\'t remember, though\r\nDr. Gar had let him study the Book), the waters stretched everywhere.\r\nAhead the sun glinted in reflection from something rising above the\r\nsurface. Ararat?\r\n\r\nHe made out the twin peaks. He throttled back to scarcely more than\r\nmach one and flew over them, high. His second pass took him back along\r\nhis own vapor trail. This time he spotted the tiny surface craft making\r\nfor the solitary bit of land. He had to hand it to Dr. 

Gar. The old\r\nboy\'s space-time grid had hit it right on the button.\r\n\r\nRoy was too high to distinguish details but he imagined that Noah and\r\nhis family would be on deck, full of the wonder of Mount Ararat rising,\r\nas promised, from the sea.\r\n\r\nBut there was another wonder--the vapor trails that stretched for miles\r\nacross the upper air. Did they, down there on the Ark, think them a\r\nsign of the Lord? Roy smiled ironically. They were a sign of the lord\r\nGar and of his servant, Pilot Officer Vanjan, come to blast them into\r\neternity and change the future, to give the animals a chance.\r\n\r\nWho would chronicle his role as the re-arranging angel, the unheavenly\r\nhost about to gather up in violence the drifting souls below? Who,\r\nhe wondered. Some simian scribe? Some unborn elephant prophet? An\r\ninsectate scholar destined to evolve from among the creeping things\r\nthat would inherit the Earth?\r\n\r\nOr perhaps the written word would die unborn under the fiery hail of\r\nhis guns.\r\n\r\nNo matter. These questions and more had been anticipated by Dr. Gar.\r\nSoon now, at the end of Roy\'s strafing run, it would be up to History\r\nto begin assembling the answers.\r\n\r\nHe slowed to mach minus and sent out wings. He would have to dip close\r\nto see if the entire Ark\'s complement was on deck. 

The job had to be\r\ndone right or Earth was kaput. Nothing personal, Noah, old boy.\r\n\r\nThere they were, on the starboard side of the top deck, well out from\r\nunder the pitch of the roof, craning their necks for a look at this\r\nmiracle in the sky where they had expected to see only a returning dove.\r\n\r\n"Behold!" Roy cried out. "I bring you tidings! But not the tidings of\r\nthe dove. I am your lost raven returned--the raven of death! My tidings\r\nare of the new future which your descendants will not know and so will\r\nnot doom."\r\n\r\nThe frightened upturned faces were far behind and he was talking to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n"Hear me, Noah, for I am come to destroy you, and with you your seeds\r\nof self-destruction. These are the tidings I bring from the future that\r\nhas ceased to exist because you existed--the future that will exist\r\nonce more when you cease to."\r\n\r\nHe heeled the spacecraft over and back. No more speeches, he told\r\nhimself, though he had studied the Book in fascination. He was a\r\nkiller, not a philosopher.\r\n\r\nHe would have to make his strafing run low. If he dived on the target\r\nhis bullets would go into the holds and kill the animals. He roared at\r\nthe Ark a few feet above the waves.\r\n\r\nThey were all together in a clump, the eight of them.\r\n\r\nFarewell, Noah! he thought as his thumbs pressed on the death-dealing\r\nbutton. Farewell, Noah and Noah\'s wife!\r\n\r\nFarewell, Ham, and Ham\'s wife and unborn sons--farewell, Canaan, and\r\nCush, and Mizraim, and Phut!\r\n\r\nFarewell, Shem! And unborn Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and\r\nAram!\r\n\r\nAnd farewell, Japheth, father of sons of science! Farewell, Gomer, and\r\nMagog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras!\r\n\r\nFarewell, all tribes. Make way for the animal kingdom in the Garic\r\nCovenant.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe had made three passes and now he zoomed into the sky. He had\r\ndestroyed humanity and changed the future.\r\n\r\nOr had he? He\'d be dead, too, if he had, gone like the snap of a finger\r\nwith the last gasp from the Ark. He had killed his ancestors. He had\r\nkilled everybody\'s ancestors, but _he_ existed still. Where was the\r\nparadox that Dr. Gar had overlooked?\r\n\r\nThe Ark had drifted closer to the shore. He circled it and counted the\r\nlifeless bodies lying in red stains on the gopher wood of the deck.\r\nEight.\r\n\r\nThen he noticed the change. The backs of his hands were hairier. His\r\nshoes were binding him. When he kicked them off his agile toes curled\r\ncomfortably around the control pedals. He had a glimpse of a hairy,\r\nflat-nosed face reflected in the instrument panel. It laughed and the\r\nsound came out a simian yap.\r\n\r\nBut for all that he was still a sentient being. His control of the\r\nspacecraft was as expert as before.\r\n\r\nIt hadn\'t worked.\r\n\r\n_Do you hear, Dr. Gar?_ he thought. 

_It\'s a flop. I goofed the mission.\r\nWe\'re all dead, no matter what._\r\n\r\n_I give you a new commandment, man who would be God: Thou shalt not\r\ntamper with time._\r\n\r\nHe had changed the future and in the future he himself had been\r\nchanged, but not enough. Somewhere below in the hold of the Ark were\r\nhis ancestors who had evolved along a new path in the new future. The\r\nevolution had been slower, perhaps, but it had been as sure, external\r\nappearances notwithstanding. Somewhere in the far new future, he was\r\nsure, there was a simian Dr. Gar looking down in solitude on the\r\nremains of Earth.\r\n\r\nThe Ark had touched the land. The animals--his fellow creatures--were\r\nbeginning to go forth, two by two, onto the shore of Ararat.\r\n\r\nHis foescope set up a clamor. There in the sky was a new thing,\r\na spacecraft like his, yet unlike it. It looked deadlier, more\r\npurposeful. Ignoring him, it was diving out of the unknowable future\r\nto destroy its own past.\r\n\r\nHe watched in professional admiration as his fellow pilot screamed\r\nunerringly for the Ark in sacrificial completion of the mission he\r\nhimself had failed to accomplish. Death to the animals, too--from an\r\nanimal pilot.\r\n\r\nHe knew then that Earth would not die. It might circle lifeless for\r\neons, waiting to welcome the foot--or paw, or tentacle--of others from\r\noutside. But it would be there, intact and serene.\r\n\r\nEven as the mountain-shattering explosion came and he himself ceased to\r\nexist, he knew.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


But he felt so damn silly!\r\n\r\nWell, he couldn\'t stand there all day. It was Monday and they would\r\nexpect him at the office.\r\n\r\nHe squared his shoulders and walked into the hall.\r\n\r\n    "Lung Cancer, Heart Attacks!\r\n    Heart Attacks, Lung Cancer!\r\n    Beware, old man, Be ... ware!

"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe tinkly message followed him up the hall. "I could jam the damn\r\nthing!" he thought, "but they\'d only repair it at daily Gov-Apts\r\nInspection and report me again!"\r\n\r\nHe pushed his hands into his pants pockets and walked into the dining\r\nell. He slouched in his chair, and watched Sally swish back and forth\r\nfrom the kitchen as she set the table. She was in blue nylon pajamas\r\nand fuzzy blue mules. Her red hair was tied up in a provocative pony\r\ntail.\r\n\r\nShe felt him watching her, gave him a devilish grin. "Sleep well last\r\nnight, dear? 

In your own little bed?"\r\n\r\n"You know damn well I didn\'t!" God, he wanted a cigarette. After two\r\nyears he still wanted one! When would the hunger for them ever stop?\r\n\r\n"You knew where I was sleeping. The door was unlocked!"\r\n\r\nShe came to him, suddenly compassionate, and sat on his lap. She pulled\r\nhis head against her. He felt, on his face, the slickness of the nylon,\r\nand underneath her firm body. She whispered, "You know honey, no matter\r\nwhat the government says, I\'m not made for sleeping alone!"\r\n\r\n"And I\'m thirty-five and not \'spose to!"\r\n\r\n"Thirty-five and eighty-nine days! How well I know! 

The toast!"\r\n\r\nShe scooted off his lap and ran into the kitchen. How she managed to\r\nburn toast in an electronic toaster beat him. By sending it down twice,\r\nhe suspected.\r\n\r\nHe picked up the paper by his plate and unfolded it. 

The first page, as\r\nusual, was devoted to the Propagandists. Headlines proclaimed: "375\r\ndied this weekend doing _you know what_." The second line asked: "Will\r\nyou be next?"\r\n\r\nIt made a good story because only three hundred deaths had been\r\npredicted. The bottom half of the page was filled with pictures of\r\nthe victims and the spouses who "lead them on, knowing at the time\r\nthat over forty percent of the heart attacks in men and women over\r\nthirty-five are brought on by sexual relations."\r\n\r\nSally was leaning over him, serving his plate with scrambled eggs and\r\nham, but he tried to ignore her and turned to the next page. Here was\r\nan editorial by the Department of Health. He scanned it. 

Same old\r\nthing. Sex to be avoided like poison by all persons, male and female,\r\nover thirty-five years.\r\n\r\nChuck forked a piece of soya bread, and swabbed the last of ham grease\r\nand egg from his plate. He sat drinking his soya hot chocolate, and\r\nwanting a cigarette.\r\n\r\nSally finished eating, stretched, and the nylon threatened to rip. She\r\nwent and got his suit coat and hat. At the door he tried to kiss her\r\ngoodbye in his best "big brother" manner. But she clinched in close,\r\nand suddenly he didn\'t feel like a brother.\r\n\r\nShe whispered in his ear, "Come on back. I\'ll call and tell them you\r\ncaught a virus!"\r\n\r\nHe almost took off his hat. Then he said, "You know it would show up\r\nin my weekly S-Count!" He shuddered just saying the words. God! 

how he\r\nhated that! He continued, "And if I slip once or twice on that, you\r\nknow what they do."\r\n\r\nFeeling sorry for her, he added half-heartedly, "But you\'re only\r\nthirty. And I wouldn\'t blame you.... Lot of people do, you know."\r\n\r\nShe leaned back, still in his arms, and laughed up at him. "No, I\'ll\r\nwait and break you down!"\r\n\r\n"Even knowing what they\'re likely to do?"\r\n\r\n"But surely! Then at least the temptation wouldn\'t be so handy!"\r\n\r\nHe walked rapidly toward the office. Other groups walked along talking\r\nand laughing. Here and there someone called to him.\r\n\r\nHe came to U.S. 75, a deserted graying eight lane strip. As he started\r\nacross, a bike came over the rise and he dived into the ditch. But\r\nit was only a Catholic priest pedalling furiously along on a girl\'s\r\nbicycle. Then there had been another clash! He climbed out of the\r\nditch, and walked a ways down the highway. 

There it was. The priest was\r\njust climbing off the bike, and there was a motorcycle cop.\r\n\r\nChuck Dane walked up the highway to the scene and stood watching. The\r\npriest was kneeling, his black bag open, administering last rites to\r\nthe two youths.\r\n\r\nThe cop, fat and redfaced, came over and stood beside Chuck. "Two less\r\nTeenagers!" he grinned.\r\n\r\n"Dying, eh?" Chuck asked.\r\n\r\n"Dying or dead! These damn kids!" He said it with just a tinge of envy.\r\n\r\nThe Father snapped his bag shut, and pedalled away. Chuck went over\r\nfor a closer look. Both of the kids were on roller skates, the powered\r\nkind. Chuck Dane noted with satisfaction that they were Airex skates.\r\n\r\nBoth of the kids had on the regular uniform, black leather jackets,\r\nand leather belts eight inches wide. Mounted on the center front of\r\nthe belts were the regulation three foot razor sharp spears. Only now\r\nthere was not much of the spears to be seen. Because neither kid had\r\nchickened. The shorter boy had caught a spear in the lower chest, and\r\nthe taller one caught it in the guts.\r\n\r\nFunny, Chuck Dane thought, staring down at them. Even in this cotton\r\nbatting, vacuum world of 1990 the Teenagers could find ways to kill\r\neach other off! He envied them their spirit!\r\n\r\nHe waved at the cop, who was calling in a report, and walked back up\r\nthe highway. When he got to his usual place, he started to cross.\r\n\r\n"Ol\xc3\xa1!"\r\n\r\nIn that frantic second, he saw only the black leather jacket bearing\r\ndown upon him. And the bike with the spear mounted on the handlebars,\r\nthe tip sparkling like a diamond in the sun. It swerved, and came\r\nstraight for him. Chuck dived into the ditch, even as he felt it prick\r\nhis coat.\r\n\r\nThe kid yelled, "Cock-a-doodle-do!" and pedalled on.\r\n\r\nChuck climbed up out of the ditch and ran across the highway. Then\r\nhe straightened his clothing, dusted himself off. 

This was damn\r\nundignified! He hated the kid, wanted to kill him with his bare hands.\r\n\r\nHe walked along, thinking how it had all come about. First it had been\r\nthe highway death toll. When it had reached over two thousand on week\r\ndays, and ten thousand on weekends, the government had stepped in.\r\nTheir solution had been simple and foolproof. They simply taxed gas out\r\nof sight. Now the oil companies exported their total output, and were\r\nmaking more money than ever.\r\n\r\nThen some fool in the A.M.A. had pointed out that almost as many people\r\nwere dying of lung cancer as had previously fallen on the ribbons of\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nAt first Congress had passed a bill to ban the manufacture of all\r\ncigarettes. But the black market flourished and the psychiatrists\r\nyelped. They yelped that the approach to the problem was all wrong,\r\ndue to the fact that they hadn\'t been consulted. This was warping\r\npersonalities and making martyrs out of cigarette users. The way to do\r\nit, they said, was to have tobacco products available, but to shame\r\npeople into giving them up of their own free wills.\r\n\r\nThey theorized that a cigarette smoker is really a frustrated person\r\nunable to cope with the adult world. When he puts a cig between his\r\nlips he is really searching for his mother\'s nipple. Therefore, the\r\nthing to do is to force him to out-grow this, rather than take it\r\nforcibly away from him. Same way with a cigar smoker or pipe smoker.\r\n\r\nThe psychiatric lobby prevailed and the government repealed the\r\ntobacco bill. And replaced it with another. Now it was the law for all\r\ncigarettes, cigars and pipe tobacco to have an hallucination inducing\r\ndrug, Xlene 91, in them. Also, as was compulsory, all cigars, pipes and\r\ncigarettes sported rubber filters shaped like nipples.\r\n\r\nThen, Chuck Dane reminisced, with lung cancer dropping off steadily,\r\nthey had started in to curb heart attacks. And taken away the only\r\npleasure a guy had left!\r\n\r\nHe was in sight of his place of work now. A huge half-circle of\r\nplexiglass that was Airex Roller Skating Factory. Chuck thought as he\r\nentered the building, that four hours was a hell of a long working day,\r\nespecially doing material control posting all that time. He hoped the\r\nbill to change working hours to three hours would pass soon....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt two o\'clock in the afternoon, Chuck lined up with the rest of the\r\noffice force to walk single file past the hidden electronic camera. Out\r\nof habit, he held his right hand in salute position, palm toward the\r\ncamera. These deals had been interesting when they first replaced the\r\nold style time clocks, now they were routine.\r\n\r\nAs the queue neared the door where the company\'s three psychiatrists\r\nstood, Chuck got more and more nervous. Suppose they could read his\r\nmind, or something!\r\n\r\nSure enough, Doctor Benton wiggled a finger for him to step out of\r\nline. He took him to one side, and peered into his face. Chuck tried to\r\nlook into the green eyes, so calm and assured, but he had to look away.\r\n\r\n"You okay, Dane?"\r\n\r\n"Sure! Tired, that\'s all. 

Helluva long day!"\r\n\r\n"Yes. Well, you come in and see me tomorrow. 

We\'ll have us a little\r\ntalk."\r\n\r\nRapidly, Chuck left the building. He muttered, "Like hell we will,\r\nHeadshrinker!"\r\n\r\nFurtively, he left the usual road home, and walked into a corner\r\ndrugstore. He stood around with his hands in his pockets, until all the\r\nother customers cleared out.\r\n\r\n"Puffies," he said.\r\n\r\nThe big man behind the counter tried to hitch his belt over his paunch.\r\n"Sure you know what you\'re doin\', Bud? Have to take your number you\r\nknow."\r\n\r\nChuck didn\'t answer. He pulled his right hand out of his pocket and\r\nlaid it palm up on the glass counter top. The man wrote down the id\r\nnumber and handed over the cigarettes.\r\n\r\nChuck walked on home, with the Puffies a guilty lump in his jacket\r\npocket. He felt sure everybody he met knew what he was up to.\r\n\r\nAt home, Chuck stuck his head in the kitchen and said "Hi" to Sally.\r\nHe resisted patting her. He went to the den and locked the door with\r\ntrembling fingers, then sat at the desk and took out his knife. He cut\r\noff the realistic red nipples from all twenty cigarettes, and made a\r\npyre of them in the middle of the glass top. Then he set fire to them,\r\nnot minding the acrid smoke.\r\n\r\nHe put a cigarette to his lips. Still he hesitated, fearing the\r\nhallucinations, about which he had heard but never experienced.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he grinned and leaned back, lit up and closed his eyes. The\r\nparade of pictures began in front of his eyeballs. First a picture of\r\nhuman lungs, and slowly the cancer virus invades them and eats them\r\naway. Then the parade of men and women clutching their chests, writhing\r\nin death throes. Chuck Dane smiled, enjoying each hallucination.\r\nPretending that the unlucky victims were the Propagandists.\r\n\r\nHe lit another cigarette from the butt of the first one, and leaned\r\nback, feeling his lungs pleasantly saturated with smoke.\r\n\r\nWhen ten cigarettes were snubbed in a row on the glass top of the desk,\r\nhe stopped and mused. Now, he guessed he would die of cancer for sure.\r\nHe wondered how long....\r\n\r\nThen another thought hit him. With two temptations, he wondered why he\r\nhad given in to the cigarette first.\r\n\r\nHe lit another Puffie and leaned back in the chair and closed his eyes.\r\nA perfect technicolor picture of Sally crossed his mind, swishing the\r\npony tail provocatively. He got up. 

Left the den. Went to the kitchen\r\nand leaned in the door watching her.\r\n\r\nTomorrow was Tuesday. His day for S-Count. But he wouldn\'t submit to\r\nthat again. Or have that little talk with Doctor Benton. Tomorrow,\r\ngoing to work, when he crossed U.S. 75 he would give some Teenager a\r\nhell of a thrill! 

But tonight ... tonight....\r\n\r\n"Come here, baby!" he whispered harshly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s The Downhill Side of Thirty, by Virgil F. Shockley\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


A Viking? A pyramid builder? One of Xenophon\'s Ten\r\nThousand? Or was he, perhaps (for it is always possible), Alexander the\r\nGreat?\r\n\r\nThatcher Blitt had a product to sell. And sell he did, for other\r\nreasons that he alone had noted at the beginning. The races of mankind\r\nhave twisted and turned with incredible complexity over the years; the\r\nnumbers of people have been enormous.\r\n\r\nWith thirty thousand years in which to work, it was impossible that\r\nthere was not, somewhere along the line, a famous ancestor for\r\neverybody. A minor king would often suffice, or even a general in some\r\nforgotten army. And if these direct ancestors were not enough, it was\r\nfairly simple to establish close blood kinship with famous men. The\r\nblood lines of Man, you see, begin with a very few people. In all of\r\nancient Greece, in the time of Pericles, there were only a few thousand\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\nSeeing all this, Thatcher Blitt became a busy man. It was necessary not\r\nonly to patent his idea, but to produce the enormous capital needed\r\nto found a large organization. The cost of the time scanner was at\r\nfirst prohibitive, but gradually that obstacle was overcome, only for\r\nThatcher to find that the government for many years prevented him from\r\nusing it. Yet Blitt was indomitable. And eventually, after years of\r\nheart-rending waiting, Genealogy, Inc., began operations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was a tremendous success. Within months, the very name of the\r\ncompany and its taut slogan, "An Ancestor for Everybody," became\r\nhousehold words. There was but one immediate drawback. It soon became\r\napparent that, without going back very far into the past, it was\r\nsometimes impossible to tell who was really the next father in line.\r\nThe mothers were certain, but the fathers were something else again.\r\nThis was a ponderable point.\r\n\r\nBut Blitt refused to be discouraged. He set various electronic\r\nengineers to work on the impasse and a solution was found. An ingenious\r\ndevice which tested blood electronically through the scanner--based\r\non the different sine waves of the blood groups--saved the day. That\r\ninvention was the last push Genealogy, Inc., was ever to need. It\r\nrolled on to become one of the richest and, for a long while, most\r\nexclusive corporations in the world.\r\n\r\nYet it was still many years before Thatcher Blitt himself had time to\r\nrest. There were patent infringements to be fought, new developments\r\nin the labs to be watched, new ways to be found to make the long and\r\narduous task of father-tracing easier and more economical. Hence he was\r\nwell past sixty when he at last had time to begin considering himself.\r\n\r\nHe had become by this time a moderately offensive man. Surrounded as\r\nhe had been all these years by pomp and luxury, by impressive names\r\nand extraordinary family trees, he had succumbed at last. He became\r\nunbearably name-conscious.\r\n\r\nHe began by regrouping his friends according to their ancestries. His\r\ninfrequent parties were characterized by his almost Parliamentarian\r\nsystem of seating. No doubt, all this had been in Thatcher Blitt to\r\nbegin with--it may well be, in perhaps varying quantities, in all of\r\nus--but it grew with him, prospered with him. Yet in all those years he\r\nnever once inspected his own forebears.\r\n\r\nYou may well ask, was he afraid? One answers, one does not know. But at\r\nany rate, the fact remains that Thatcher Blitt, at the age of 67, was\r\none of the few rich men in the world who did not know who exactly their\r\nancestors had been.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd so, at last, we come to the day when Thatcher Blitt was sitting\r\nalone in his office, one languid hand draped vacantly over his brow,\r\nlistening with deep satisfaction to the hum and click of the enormous\r\noperations which were going on in the building around him.\r\n\r\nWhat moved him that day remains uncertain. Perhaps it was that, from\r\nwhere he was sitting, he could see row upon row of action pictures of\r\nfamous men which had been taken from his time scanners. 

Or perhaps it\r\nwas simply that this profound question had been gnawing at him all\r\nthese years, deeper and deeper, and on this day broke out into the\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nBut whatever the reason, at 11:02 that morning, he leaped vitally from\r\nhis chair. He summoned Cathcart, his chief assistant, and gave him the\r\nimmortal command.\r\n\r\n"Cathcart!" he grated, stung to the core of his being. 

"Who am I?"\r\n\r\nCathcart rushed off to find out.\r\n\r\nThere followed some of the most taut and fateful days in the brilliant\r\nhistory of Genealogy, Inc. Father-tracing is, of course, a painstaking\r\nbusiness. But it was not long before word had begun to filter out to\r\ninterested people.\r\n\r\nThe first interesting discovery made was a man called Blott, in\r\neighteenth century England. (No explanation was ever given for the\r\nname\'s alteration from Blott to Blitt. Certain snide individuals\r\ntook this to mean that the name had been changed as a means to avoid\r\nprosecution, or some such, and immediately began making light remarks\r\nabout the Blotts on old Blitt\'s escutcheon.) This Blott had the\r\ndistinction of having been a wineseller of considerable funds.\r\n\r\nThis reputedly did not sit well with Thatcher Blitt. Merchants, he\r\nsnapped, however successful, are not worthy of note. 

He wanted empire\r\nbuilders. He wanted, at the very least, a name he had heard about. 

A\r\nname that appeared in the histories.\r\n\r\nHis workers furiously scanned back into the past.\r\n\r\nMonths went by before the next name appeared. In 9th century England,\r\nthere was a wandering minstrel named John (last name unprintable) who\r\nachieved considerable notoriety as a ballad singer, before dying an\r\nunnatural death in the boudoir of a lady of high fashion. Although\r\nthe details of this man\'s life were of extreme interest, they did\r\nnot impress the old man. 

He was, on the contrary, rather shaken. 

A\r\nminstrel. And a rogue to boot.\r\n\r\nThere were shakeups in Genealogy, Inc. Cathcart was replaced by a man\r\nnamed Jukes, a highly competent man despite his interesting family\r\nname. Jukes forged ahead full steam past the birth of Christ (no\r\nrelation). But he was well into ancient Egypt before the search began\r\nto take on the nature of a crisis.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUp until then, there was simply nobody. Or to be more precise, nobody\r\nbut _nobodies_. It was incredible, all the laws of chance were against\r\nit, but there was, actually, not a single ancestor of note. And no\r\nway of faking one, for Thatcher Blitt couldn\'t be fooled by his own\r\nmethods. What there was was simply an unending line of peasants,\r\nserfs, an occasional foot soldier or leather worker. Past John the\r\nballad-singer, there was no one at all worth reporting to the old man.\r\n\r\nThis situation would not continue, of course. There were so few\r\nfamilies for men to spring from. The entire Gallic nation, for example,\r\na great section of present-day France, sprang from the family of one\r\nlone man in the north of France in the days before Christ. Every native\r\nFrenchman, therefore, was at least the son of a king. It was impossible\r\nfor Thatcher Blitt to be less.\r\n\r\nSo the hunt went on from day to day, past ancient Greece, past\r\nJarmo, past the wheel and metals and farming and on even past all\r\ncivilization, outward and backward into the cold primordial wastes of\r\nnorthern Germany.\r\n\r\nAnd still there was nothing. Though Jukes lived in daily fear of losing\r\nhis job, there was nothing to do but press on. In Germany, he reduced\r\nBlitt\'s ancestor to a slovenly little man who was one of only three\r\nmen in the entire tribe, or family, one of three in an area which now\r\ncontains millions. But Blitt\'s ancestor, true to form, was simply a\r\nmember of the tribe. As was his father before him.\r\n\r\nYet onward it went. Westward back into the French caves, southward\r\ninto Spain and across the unrecognizable Mediterranean into a verdant\r\nNorth Africa, backward in time past even the Cro-Magnons, and yet ever\r\nbackward, 30,000 years, 35,000, with old Blitt reduced now practically\r\nto gibbering and still never an exceptional forebear.\r\n\r\nThere came a time when Jukes had at last, inevitably, to face the old\r\nman. He had scanned back as far as he could. 

The latest ancestor he had\r\nunearthed for Blitt was a hairy creature who did not walk erect. And\r\nyet, even here, Blitt refused to concede.\r\n\r\n"It may be," he howled, "it _must_ be that my ancestor _was_ the first\r\nman to walk erect or light a fire--to do _something_."\r\n\r\nIt was not until Jukes pointed out that all those things had been\r\nalready examined and found hopeless that Blitt finally gave in. Blitt\r\nwas a relative, of course, of the first man to stand erect, the man\r\nwith the first human brain. But so was everybody else on the face of\r\nthe Earth. 

There was truly nowhere else to explore. What would be found\r\nnow would be only the common history of mankind.\r\n\r\nBlitt retired to his chambers and refused to be seen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe story went the rounds, as such stories will. And it was then\r\nat last, after 40,000 years of insignificance, that the name of\r\nBlitt found everlasting distinction. The story was picked up, fully\r\ndocumented, by psychologists and geneticists of the time, and inserted\r\ninto textbooks as a profound commentary on the forces of heredity. The\r\nname of Thatcher Blitt in particular has become famous, has persisted\r\nuntil this day. For he is the only man yet discovered, or ever likely\r\nto be discovered, with this particular distinction.\r\n\r\nIn 40,000 years of scanner-recorded history, the blood line of Blitt\r\n(or Blott) never once produced an exceptional man.\r\n\r\nThat record is unsurpassed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


But he hadn\'t been able to pin\r\nthe feeling down.\r\n\r\n    _... Our civilization predates that of Earth\'s by millions of years.\r\n    We are an advanced, peaceful race. Yet, since Earth\'s first rocket\r\n    landed here thirteen years ago, we have been looked upon as freaks\r\n    and contemptuously called \'bug-men\' behind our backs! This is our\r\n    planet. We gave of our far-advanced knowledge and science freely, so\r\n    that Earth would be a better place. We asked nothing in return, but\r\n    we were rewarded by having forced upon us foreign ideas of\r\n    government, religion, and behavior. Our protests have been silenced\r\n    by an armed-police and punitive system we\'ve never before needed.\r\n    Someday you will awaken to this injustice. On that day in your life,\r\n    you have my sympathy and pity!_\r\n\r\nStark knew that the Settlement\'s Investigations Lab could readily\r\ndetermine the identity of the Martian who had written the note. But he\r\nhesitated to send it over. Under the New System, such troublemakers were\r\nbanished to the slave-labor details of the precious-earth mines to the\r\nNorth.\r\n\r\nCrumpling the note in sudden decision, Stark dropped it into the office\r\nincendiary tube. The morning visi-report had shown that there were more\r\nthan 17,000 workers at the mines. Only five had been Earthlings. Let the\r\narmed-police system find the Martian through their own channels. It\r\nwasn\'t his job.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA glance at the solar clock on the far wall reminded him there was still\r\ntime for one more interview before the last bell, so he impatiently\r\nsignaled his secretary to send in the waiting couple.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, he liked his work and time meant little to him. He had\r\njumped from interpreter to director in the ten years since the\r\ndepartment had been created. But this day was different.\r\n\r\nStark was to announce his engagement at the Chief\'s monthly dinner party\r\nthat evening and time had seemed to drag since his lunch with Carol.\r\n\r\nWhen the door opened, he rose and nodded to the plump, freckle-faced\r\ngirl who entered. The girl topped five feet by one or two inches, but\r\nshe was no taller than the Martian man who followed her at the\r\nprescribed four feet.\r\n\r\nAfter the girl had seated herself, Stark and the Martian sat down. Stark\r\nopened the folder, which his secretary had placed on his desk earlier.\r\n\r\n"Your names are Ruth and Ralph Gilraut? And you want permission to move\r\ninto Housing Perimeter D?" It was merely a formality, since the\r\ninformation was in the folder.\r\n\r\nWhen the girl nodded, Stark placed a small check mark in the space\r\nbeside her name. Then he turned to the Martian.\r\n\r\nThe large, single red eye set deep in the Martian\'s smooth, green\r\nforehead above the two brown ones blinked twice before he answered.\r\n\r\nHe spoke deliberately. "As is required of all Martians under the New\r\nSystem, I have taken the name of one of the early Earthlings to write\r\nand pronounce." The large red eye blinked again. "My wife would like\r\nto move into Housing Perimeter D. By regulation, I respect her wish."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nStark placed a check mark by the Martian\'s name. He wiped the smudge of\r\nink off his hand and said, "You both know, of course, that Perimeter D\r\nis reserved for couples who have intermarried and are about to have\r\noffspring?"\r\n\r\nThe girl and the Martian nodded, and the girl passed Stark a medical\r\nreport. Stark looked over the report and then made a notation on a small\r\npink slip.\r\n\r\nHe said, "This permit certifies that you are eligible to move from\r\nPerimeter E to Housing Perimeter D. It also certifies that your husband\r\nhas no record as a troublemaker." Stark looked at the girl. "You\r\nunderstand that you may visit your friends in Perimeter E, but, by law,\r\nthey will not be allowed to enter Perimeter D to visit you. And, of\r\ncourse, the new law clearly states that neither of you may visit\r\nEarthlings in Housing Perimeter A, B or C."\r\n\r\nThe girl looked down at her hands. Her voice was almost inaudible. "My\r\nhusband and I are familiar with the advantages and disadvantages listed\r\nunder the section pertaining to intermarriage in the new law, Mr. Stark.\r\nThank you.

"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nStark rose as they left. For a brief moment, he thought he had detected\r\na sense of rebellion in their attitude. But that was not possible.\r\n\r\nThe new law provided equality for all. And his department had been\r\ncreated to iron out relations between the two races--excepting\r\ncomplaints originated by troublemakers for the purpose of weakening the\r\nNew System. In such cases, Investigations had stepped in and the Martian\r\nor Earthling troublemaker had been sent to the rare-earth mines.\r\n\r\nThe reddish light filtering in through the quartz and lead wall of his\r\noffice showed that it was almost time for the last bell.\r\n\r\nOn the street below, shoppers were streaming out of the stores on their\r\nway to the various housing perimeters.\r\n\r\nEarthlings were climbing into their speedy little jet cars for the short\r\ntrip to the recently modernized inner perimeters. Martians were waiting\r\nfor the slower auto buses. The traffic problem had been solved, under\r\nthe New System, by restricting the use of the Martian-built jet cars to\r\npersons living in the inner perimeters.\r\n\r\nAs Stark watched, a black jet car impatiently hurtled out of the line of\r\ntraffic, bowled through a crowd of Martians waiting for an auto bus, and\r\nskidded to a stop at the curb in front of the building.\r\n\r\nA tall girl got out. The red evening glow reflecting from her golden\r\nhair, made her breathing globe almost amber. Male Martians and\r\nEarthlings alike turned to stare in appreciation as she pushed her way\r\nthrough the crowd to the building\'s compressor lock. Carol was that kind\r\nof girl.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlmost at the exact moment that Carol opened the door into Stark\'s\r\noffice, the yellow visi-screen of the vocal box upon Stark\'s desk\r\nflashed on brilliantly and the Chief\'s booming voice filled the office.\r\nThe light from the screen picked up the highlights on the furniture and\r\ngave a sallow, greenish cast to Stark\'s features. Carol stepped back\r\ninto the doorway to stay out of range of the two-way unit.\r\n\r\n"Stark!" The automatic tuner on the box corrected to bring the Chief\'s\r\nimage in wire-sharp focus.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir?"\r\n\r\n"About the dinner tonight. 

Just checking to make sure you\'re planning to\r\nbe there. 

We want a full turnout. An inspection team has come up from\r\nEarth and we have two visiting dignitaries from Venus."\r\n\r\nStark nodded and waited for the Chief to say something else, but the\r\nvisi-screen blanked out.\r\n\r\nCarol said, "That was Dad, wasn\'t it?"\r\n\r\nStark felt very depressed suddenly. "Haven\'t you told him yet?"\r\n\r\n"No. He\'s been tied up with those inspectors all afternoon. And you know\r\nhow Dad is, Johnny. There\'s a right and a wrong time to tell him things.\r\nRight now, he\'s only interested in hearing about Earth."\r\n\r\n"But we\'re supposed to announce our engagement tonight at the dinner."\r\nHe shook his head. 

"We can\'t go on forever with just a few stolen\r\nmoments here and there, eating an occasional lunch or third meal\r\ntogether in little out-of-the-way places."\r\n\r\nCarol laughed, the youthful swell of her breasts against the soft,\r\nspun-glass material of her blouse. "Don\'t worry so, Johnny! I\'m a big\r\ngirl now. This is my eighteenth birthday. Dad\'s bark is much worse than\r\nhis bite. I\'ll tell him about us on the way home.

"\r\n\r\nShe moved closer to him, until he could feel the warmth of her body. He\r\ncould see the warm, damp indentation where her breathing globe had\r\nrested against her shoulders and chest.\r\n\r\nShe asked teasingly, "What did you get me for my birthday, Johnny?\r\nSomething real nice?"\r\n\r\n"What did you want?" Johnny asked her gently.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly she wasn\'t teasing any more. She put her arms around him.\r\n"Dad and my brother would say I\'m crazy. But all I want, Johnny, is you.\r\nJust you! 

You know that."\r\n\r\nStark had picked out her birthday present, but he wanted it to be a\r\nsurprise for that night. He said, "I already saw one of your presents. A\r\nblack jet car!"\r\n\r\n"How did you know that?"\r\n\r\n"I saw you drive up in it a few minutes ago."\r\n\r\nCarol giggled. "Dad gave it to me. Did you see me plow through that\r\ncrowd waiting for the auto bus?"\r\n\r\n"Did your brother send you anything?"\r\n\r\nShe nodded. "Three new outfits from Earth. They were on the same liner\r\nthat brought the inspection team to the Settlement this morning. Oh,\r\nyes, and the captain of the liner brought me this."\r\n\r\nShe showed him the tiny pin she wore attached to her collar. The pin\r\nitself was a carefully wrought but cruel caricature of an awkward\r\nbuglike creature. A small ruby set in the center of its face served as\r\nits eye.\r\n\r\nStark frowned. "Carol, you shouldn\'t be wearing that." He reached up and\r\nunpinned it. "That\'s the sort of thing our department is fighting."\r\n\r\n"But the captain said it was the latest rage back on Earth. They\'re even\r\nmaking toys like it. I\'m sure they\'re not designed to ... to poke fun at\r\nanyone."\r\n\r\nStark started to say something, but the last bell interrupted him. He\r\nsaid, "If you\'re going to take your father home and tell him about us\r\nbefore the dinner, you\'d better hurry. I\'ll come early.

"\r\n\r\nCarol kissed him and said good-by. She left the pin on Stark\'s desk and\r\nwas smiling at him as she closed the door.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter waiting until the first rush of workers had gone and the building\r\nwas quiet, Stark caught the elevator down. The overhead lights in the\r\ncompressor lock were reflected in the twin rows of breathing globes. The\r\ngreen-tinted ones had to be used by Martians in the building, and the\r\nclear ones were used by Earthmen when they were outside in the Martian\r\natmosphere. Stark stopped in at a little open shop down one of the many\r\nside streets. The sign said "Closed," but he rang the bell until a\r\nlittle, dried-up Martian appeared.\r\n\r\nThe storekeeper handed him a small box. Stark opened it to examine the\r\nring--Carol\'s birthday present. The single, large diamond set in the\r\nthin precious-metal band dated back to an all-but-forgotten custom\r\npracticed on Earth. Stark thought the engagement ring would please\r\nCarol, though.\r\n\r\nStanding in the compressor lock at the Chief\'s home later, Stark rubbed\r\nthe diamond against the sleeve of his tunic. He fumbled with his\r\nbreathing globe and then pushed the button that activated the door. The\r\ntele-guard beyond the opening door scanned him rapidly. As he stepped\r\nforward, a red light above the tele-guard flashed on and the door began\r\nto close again.\r\n\r\nStark threw all his strength against the door and squeezed through into\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nThroughout the house, Stark could hear the alarm bell. A taped voice,\r\nactivated by the tele-guard, said, "Do not enter! 

Do not enter!"\r\n\r\nHe found Carol and the Chief in the library alone. Nearly purple with\r\nrage, the Chief drew himself up to his full six feet.\r\n\r\nThe Chief bellowed, "Stark! Are you crazy?"\r\n\r\nThe growing feeling of sickness spread through Stark.\r\n\r\n"Who do you think you are?" the Chief yelled. "Get back to your office\r\nand consider yourself under arrest as a troublemaker. Give you people an\r\ninch and you try to walk away with everything. Why, I wouldn\'t let you\r\ntouch my daughter if you were the last living being in the Universe!"\r\n\r\nCarol didn\'t look up. 

She stood through it all, silently, without\r\nmoving. Stark knew now where his blind spot had been. He turned and left\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBack at his office, he waited for the police. Stark stared down at his\r\nreflection in the polished top of the desk. A yellow, moist film of\r\nsweat covered his face. 

The red eye set in his forehead blinked. But the\r\npain visible just behind the surface of that eye was not over Carol or\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThe pain was for what he was seeing for the first time ... now.\r\n\r\n                                                   --BASCOM JONES, JR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Galaxy Science Fiction_ February 1955.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

"\r\n\r\nAgain Kroll shrugged. "The Inquisitor would like Miss Horniman first,\r\nMr. Leslie. 

This is the preferred order, and this is the order that\r\nwill be."\r\n\r\nA guard stepped forward and shoved the sobbing girl up and ahead,\r\ntoward the door. The man named Leslie clashed his manacles impotently\r\ntogether and spat. "Butchers! Torturers!"\r\n\r\n"Please, Mr. Leslie," Kroll said gently, a pained expression on his\r\nface. "You make our job even harder than it is."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe followed the girl into the adjoining room, where the Inquisitor was\r\nwaiting. The Interrogation Chamber was an immense rectangular room with\r\nconcrete floor and bleak white walls, in the center of which stood the\r\nInquisitor.\r\n\r\n"Good morning, Kroll," the Inquisitor said. Its metallic voice rattled\r\nand boomed in the big room. In the depths of the machine, relays\r\nclicked and hummed. Kroll bowed to it, and the Inquisitor responded\r\nwith a gesture of a prolonged metal arm. "The first prisoner, Kroll."\r\n\r\n"Miss Florence Horniman," Kroll said. "Accused of treason against the\r\nState. Denies charge.

"\r\n\r\n"How do you plead?" the machine asked coldly.\r\n\r\n"Not guilty," stammered the girl.\r\n\r\nTwo huge metal arms extended from the Inquisitor\'s sides and folded\r\naround her. They drew her across the room to the bosom of the robot.\r\n"Feed in the data, Kroll."\r\n\r\nAt the signal, Kroll slipped in the tape on the girl. A moment passed\r\nwhile the Inquisitor digested the data, and then: "The plea of not\r\nguilty is rejected as invalid."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t just do that!" 

the girl said. 

"That\'s my plea!"\r\n\r\n"Not valid in view of the evidence," said the Inquisitor. Kroll smiled\r\ndistantly. He had seen this scene repeated, over and over, almost\r\nevery day for the ten years he had held the post. He wrapped his\r\nblue-and-gold Interrogator\'s cloak around himself impressively and\r\nstepped forward.\r\n\r\n"You are accused of treason against the State," Kroll said sonorously.\r\n"But it is my duty to inform you that your sentence may be mitigated\r\nupon your delivering us certain information--about leaders of your\r\nmovement, future plans, location of your party cell, and so forth."\r\n\r\nFlorence Horniman\'s eyes flashed brightly. "I won\'t tell you anything!"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I did not make myself clear," Kroll said. He repeated his\r\noffer.\r\n\r\n"The answer is still no!"\r\n\r\nKroll sighed. 

"Very well," he said. A third hand slid from the\r\nInquisitor\'s body and a needle-thin finger traced a line down the\r\ngirl\'s bare arm. A bloody trickle appeared.\r\n\r\nShe began to sob again. Kroll stepped closer and lifted her head. "Why\r\nmust you hold out?" he asked. "Why don\'t you speak?

"\r\n\r\nStill silence. The finger rose again and sliced lightly across her\r\ncheek.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"All right, take her away," Kroll said when twenty minutes had passed.\r\nThe Inquisitor was humming merrily, busily taping the data that had\r\nbeen extracted from the girl and feeding it to the main computers\r\ndownstairs. They would integrate it and notify the State Police. It was\r\na smooth-functioning system.\r\n\r\nThe bloody thing that had been Florence Horniman was led away by\r\na guard, and the next prisoner led in. It was the middle-aged man,\r\nChester Wengrove.\r\n\r\n"Get your hands off me," he snapped to the guard as he was shoved into\r\nthe room. "You have no right to--"\r\n\r\n"Unfortunately, as a representative of the State he has every right,"\r\nKroll said calmly. He fed Wengrove\'s tape to the Inquisitor. The trial\r\nproceeded.\r\n\r\nWengrove was stubborn; it took half an hour to break him down at all,\r\nbut when he did speak he sang freely, giving data on his cell of the\r\nMovement.\r\n\r\n"Very good," the Inquisitor said when Wengrove finally coughed and said\r\nhe knew no more. "You are completely exonerated from the charge of\r\ntreason, in view of the information you have given."\r\n\r\nThe eyes in the bloody face lit up. "I\'m free, you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Unfortunately, no," the Inquisitor said. "Because of your danger\r\nto the State, you must be kept in Quarantine Camp, along with other\r\ndiseased former members of society, until such time as we are able to\r\nclear your mind of its confusion. But you will not be punished."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t be punished?" Wengrove repeated mindlessly.\r\n\r\n"When the Inquisitor says something, it means it," Kroll said. "Take\r\nhim away."\r\n\r\nThe next prisoner was Neil Leslie. He strode into the Inquisitor\'s\r\nChamber without having to be pushed, and confronted Kroll defiantly.\r\n"My turn, eh?"\r\n\r\nKroll nodded. "Your companions have both been removed." He nodded\r\nmeaningful toward the Inquisitor, whose claws were red with the blood\r\nof Florence Horniman and Chester Wengrove. "They both spoke most\r\nsatisfactorily----after some persuasion.

"\r\n\r\n"Torture, you mean."\r\n\r\n"We\'ve been through this already," Kroll said. "Since you\'re going to\r\ntalk anyway, I don\'t understand why you can\'t save yourself a great\r\ndeal of pain by talking now, before I hand you to the Inquisitor."\r\n\r\n"Because I don\'t mean to talk at all," Leslie said. He ran a hand\r\nthrough his shock of blonde hair and glared fiercely at Kroll.\r\n\r\n"Very well," the Interrogator said. He stepped to the robot and slipped\r\nin Neil Leslie\'s tape.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"I don\'t understand you at all," Kroll admitted, looking down at the\r\npain-racked body before him. "Why don\'t you talk? 

I don\'t _want_ to\r\nkeep you in here, you know."\r\n\r\nBloodshot eyes looked back at him, eyes clouded with pain and hatred.\r\n"I\'m not saying anything," Leslie murmured. "Oil up your robot and\r\nlet\'s try again."\r\n\r\nFor the hundredth time the Inquisitor\'s talons descended, raked a red\r\nline across the man\'s body. He shuddered, but did not speak. Kroll\r\nshook his head impatiently. No prisoner had ever held out against the\r\nInquisitor this long before. He found himself perspiring.\r\n\r\nThe Inquisitor said, "The name of your leader is David Cosbro. Is this\r\ntrue?"\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\nA needle descended.\r\n\r\nStill no answer.\r\n\r\n"Your Cell was located in East Appalachia. Upper Quadrant. 

Is this\r\ntrue?"\r\n\r\nNo answer again.\r\n\r\nMinutes passed, minutes in which Leslie continued to stare defiantly\r\noutward, continued to clench his fists and remain silent.\r\n\r\nFinally the Inquisitor opened its tightly-clamped arms and let Leslie\r\nstagger out. He slumped to the ground at the feet of the robot and\r\nleaned dazedly against the Inquisitor\'s gleaming base.\r\n\r\n"Prisoner is on the verge of death," the Inquisitor said. "Further\r\nquestioning is pointless."\r\n\r\nKroll looked down in surprise and chagrin. In ten years, this was the\r\nfirst time a prisoner had not broken under Interrogation. He scowled\r\nangrily; it was his first failure.\r\n\r\n"You\'re a stubborn man, Leslie. But it\'s killed you."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not dead yet," the prisoner said brokenly. Suddenly he mustered\r\nsome strength and managed to look up. "Tell me something, Kroll. I want\r\nto know something."\r\n\r\n"Yes?"\r\n\r\n"Why do you do what you do?"\r\n\r\n"You mean--Interrogate?"\r\n\r\n"I mean torture," Leslie said.\r\n\r\n"I am an Interrogator because it is my duty to the State. Treason must\r\nbe unmasked, the enemies of the State destroyed. It is necessary."\r\n\r\nLeslie looked up, and there seemed to be pity in his eyes. "Just one\r\nquestion, Kroll. 

Doesn\'t it bother you, when you go home? _How do you\r\nknow you\'re right and we\'re wrong?_"\r\n\r\nKroll started to say something, then saw there was no point in\r\nbothering.\r\n\r\n"Prisoner is dead," said the Inquisitor.\r\n\r\n"Take him away," ordered Kroll. The day was over.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat Leslie had said preyed on Kroll\'s mind all the way home. He got\r\nout of the tube and made his way to his austere room with his mind\r\nfixed on one question--the snarling words the dying prisoner had\r\nhurled at him: _How do you know you\'re right and we\'re wrong?_\r\n\r\nThey _had_ to be wrong, Kroll told himself firmly. The State had to\r\nbe right. It was necessary; it was logical; it was the way things had\r\nalways been.\r\n\r\nBut the thought obsessed him, and the image of Neil Leslie\'s face,\r\nbloody but undefeated, hung before him as he went about his evening\'s\r\nactivities. The face was still in his mind as he prepared to go to bed.\r\n\r\nOdd, Kroll thought. This was the first time he had been disturbed after\r\na torture session. He had seen hundreds--no, thousands--pass through\r\nthe Inquisitor, come out shambling rags of bone and flesh, and it had\r\nnever bothered him, because they were enemies of the State and deserved\r\nno more.\r\n\r\nHe dropped off into an uneasy sleep. But suddenly, in the small hours\r\nof the night, he sat bolt upright in bed, a cold, clammy perspiration\r\nbreaking out on him.\r\n\r\nLeslie had just asked the question for the hundredth time. And Kroll\r\nhad had no answer. He _didn\'t_ know who was right. He just didn\'t know.\r\nHis mind, unswervingly loyal for so many years, swayed in an agony of\r\ndoubt.\r\n\r\nHe got out of bed and paced back and forth across the floor of his room.\r\n\r\n"The State is wrong!" he said aloud. 

But it didn\'t sound right. It\r\ncouldn\'t be true. It wasn\'t true. "Stupid!" he told himself. It\r\nwas stupid to distrust the State--and wrong. "Wrong! Criminally,\r\ndisgustingly wrong!"\r\n\r\nThere! He felt better. He had rid himself of his foolish doubts. "How\r\ncould I have been so foolish?" he said aloud. His nerves felt better\r\nnow. Once again he was ready to do his duty as a loyal officer of the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nSmiling to himself for being so easily disturbed by the remarks of\r\ndisloyal traitors, he climbed back into bed and closed his eyes. A few\r\nmoments later, he was asleep.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, everything seemed to be all right; the terrors of the\r\nlast twelve hours were pale things of the past, no longer exerting\r\npressure on him. He caught the tube and headed to the Ministry.\r\n\r\nHe donned his uniform in the locker room and took the elevator to the\r\nInterrogation Floor. He stepped into his office. It was empty. 

No\r\nprisoners this morning? It didn\'t seem likely.\r\n\r\nHe pushed open the inner door and entered the Interrogation Chamber.\r\nTo his surprise, he saw Matthews, one of his assistants, wearing the\r\nuniform of an Interrogator and standing near the robot, arms folded.\r\n\r\n"What are you doing in here dressed that way?" Kroll snapped.\r\n\r\n"I am the new Interrogator," Matthews told him.\r\n\r\n"Since when?"\r\n\r\n"The appointment was made very early this morning," the Inquisitor\r\nsaid. "We have all the evidence we need to brand you as a traitor to\r\nthe State."\r\n\r\nThe new Interrogator turned a switch, and Kroll heard his own voice\r\ncome from a speaker. "_The State is wrong! Stupid! Wrong! Criminally,\r\ndisgustingly wrong! How could I have been so foolish?_"\r\n\r\n"There is no need to deny these words," said the Interrogator. "It is\r\nonly necessary that you tell us with whom you have been working."\r\n\r\n"But there\'s no one!" Kroll shouted. "You don\'t understand! 

I\'m loyal!\r\nI can explain!"\r\n\r\nBut the new Interrogator merely looked cold as the long, chilling metal\r\narms of the Inquisitor reached out and gathered Kroll to its steel\r\nbosom.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


exclaimed DeCrabbe haughtily. "Always dislike long\r\nconversations you know. Supposing you tell me what you know so can\r\nexterminate them without further delay. No doubt solution before dusk."\r\n\r\n"Before dusk?" asked the mayor, dumfounded. "Oh, no, not today, I\'m\r\nafraid. 

They\'ve been around too many years to whip in one day."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps shall require two days then," said Five-gun Charles DeCrabbe\r\ngraciously. "But doubt it. 

Tell me what you know of them."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Very well," assented the older man. "Perhaps the best place to\r\nbegin is with their name. When we first occupied this planet, a\r\nbare twenty years ago, we called them wolfhawk-whirlybirds and\r\ntigerhawk-whirlybirds because they preyed on vicious animals. The\r\nwhirlybirds were our best friends in those days. The only trouble is\r\nthat they ran out of tigers and wolves to eat."\r\n\r\n"Presumed they are now called peoplehawk-whirlybirds?" DeCrabbe\r\nfrowningly asked in his clipped speech.\r\n\r\n"Exactly!" answered the older man. 

"Although that isn\'t their full\r\nname. From the way they attack--"\r\n\r\n"Most important," interrupted Five-gun. "Give to me in detail."\r\n\r\n"They prefer to attack strollers, although they have attacked on city\r\nstreets when there is little traffic. They fly with amazing speed,\r\nconsidering they are an untidy ball forty feet in diameter, and they\r\nare on top of their victims before the unlucky ones are aware of the\r\nmenace. Blowing their victims down with a rush of air from their\r\nfeathers, they grab them up by the heels, carry them high aloft and\r\ndrop them on piles of rock outside of town."\r\n\r\n"They are _downdraft_-peoplehawk-whirlybirds then?" asked DeCrabbe.\r\n\r\n"That\'s almost it," agreed the mayor. "I have not yet told\r\nyou of their cries. 

As they rise in the air with the victim\r\ndangling from their talons by his heels, they utter a pleased\r\n\'Coo! Coo!\' like a gentle dove. That is why they are called\r\nCoocoo-downdraft-peoplehawk-whirlybirds."\r\n\r\n"Approve of adequate names," nodded Five-gun, unbending a trifle.\r\n"First step toward efficiency. Only one thing haven\'t made clear.\r\nPresumably have shotguns and rifles. 

Why unable drive off these\r\npredators yourselves?"\r\n\r\nThe mayor laughed bitterly. "It would be easy to tell you\'d just\r\narrived on this planet--although the birds are not well known in the\r\nother cities either; they are all concentrated in this area. Yes, our\r\nsportsmen tried to shoot down the whirlybirds. No luck, of course.\r\nImagine the problems you have when one of these forty-foot balls of\r\ncommotion comes at you: You try to aim but you can\'t hold your arm\r\nstill because of the swirling wind they raise; and then the dust clouds\r\nthicken and you\'re firing wildly, and you can\'t begin to tell which is\r\nbody and which is feathers anyway."\r\n\r\n"Very well," accepted Charles DeCrabbe mercifully. 

"You\'ve made\r\nattempt. My first step therefore the attachment of high explosives to\r\nboobytrapped mannequins. Brought these with me."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Great winds of catastrophe. I\'m glad you mentioned it before you did\r\nit!" exclaimed the mayor. 

"We tried that once. The city was six weeks\r\ndigging out from under the feathers--and it didn\'t kill the whirlybird!"\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t you exaggerating difficulties encountered in picking up few\r\nfeathers?" loftily inquired DeCrabbe.\r\n\r\n"How do you think we got the name of Featherton? Before the deluge we\r\nwere called West Applebury!"\r\n\r\n"Then why haven\'t you attempted lure them into boobytraps outside town?\r\nCould detonate them there without even slight inconvenience of picking\r\nup feathers."\r\n\r\n"Believe me, if there were only a _few_ feathers," insisted Mayor\r\nPrince, "few enough for you to pick up by yourself, we wouldn\'t mind\r\nyou blowing up a whirlybird."\r\n\r\n"Wasn\'t considering picking up _any_ feathers," replied Five-gun with\r\ndignity. "Had supposed a menial or two could be supplied for that."\r\n\r\nThe mayor shook his head. "It would take everybody in town to clean\r\nup. And as for blowing one up outside the city, one of our orchardists\r\ntried it. He blew it to bits all right, but eighty acres of his apple\r\ntrees were smothered under the debris!"\r\n\r\n"Now anticipate that the extermination of the whirlybirds will almost\r\ncertainly take me up to two days," conceded Five-gun DeCrabbe calmly.\r\n"However will be all the more interesting to defeat them without\r\nrecourse large explosives."\r\n\r\n"Gee, what a man!" 

admired the mayor\'s son. "Only two days!"\r\n\r\n"If you will now lead me to your city park will begin campaign of\r\nextermination at once."\r\n\r\n"It\'s down that way," said the mayor, pointing. Plainly he had no\r\nintention of leaving the shelter of the marquee. "You can\'t miss it."\r\n\r\nAs Five-gun Charles DeCrabbe leaped back into his craft and started\r\noff, the mayor\'s son called after him, "Aren\'t you scared, going out\r\nexposed like that?"\r\n\r\nDeCrabbe turned. "Am armed, young man," he retorted severely.\r\n\r\n"Yeah, but those whirlybirds don\'t pay any attention to guns."\r\n\r\n"Soon will," DeCrabbe replied, unruffled.\r\n\r\nSlowly he drove down the center of the empty street, receiving more\r\ncheers from heads thrust out of windows. He arrived at the city park\r\nand turned in. He unloaded most of his equipment under the roof of the\r\nbandstand.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later one of his robot mannequins moved slowly around\r\nthe clearing before the bandstand, its control set for slow walking to\r\nconserve its atomic battery. The predator hunter unlimbered all his\r\nguns as he sat under the bandstand roof waiting.\r\n\r\nIt was an hour before the first whirlybird attacked.\r\n\r\nHis first warning was the rising wind. His gaze moved around the sky\r\nuntil he found the rapidly growing black spot. A few seconds later\r\nit became a universe-engulfing blackness as it spotted the mannequin\r\nand came down for it. As soon as the wind-screaming blackness reached\r\nthe mannequin, the needle guns in his hands emptied their hundreds of\r\nanesthetizing needles into the turbulence. But it was as the mayor had\r\nsaid. Where did the bird\'s body end and the feathers begin? When the\r\nneedle pistols were empty he dropped them and snatched up the rocket\r\npowered stun-gas weapon; its immense flare poured into the blackness\r\nwithout visible result. He dropped it and grabbed the N-ray flashburn\r\ngun. The forty-foot ball of fury was beginning to rise high with its\r\nprey now, as the gun stuttered fifty bolts of burning lethal radiation\r\ninto it. He smelled feathers that time. Finally as the giant bird,\r\nwithout faltering, rose above the range of the N-ray gun, he took to\r\nthe explosive pellet rifle. It had only ten shots; all of these went\r\ninto the center of the blackness well before the whirlybird had flown\r\nbeyond range. And as it neared the horizon with its mannequin prey, he\r\nheard its sweet song:\r\n\r\n"Coo! Coo!"\r\n\r\n"How _dare_ it coo after all I did to it?" muttered DeCrabbe grimly.\r\n"Shall not coo next time!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later a new mannequin stood out in front of the bandstand.\r\nIts arms waved ceaselessly but it stood still. Nestled against its\r\nback was a ten gallon drum of gas, which would be exploded--blanketing\r\nmost of the park in fumes--as soon as the mannequin was moved. Charles\r\nDeCrabbe waited, his mask ready, his potent weapons all reloaded.\r\n\r\nNinety minutes later the huge black menace arrived--either the first\r\nwhirlybird or another forty-foot wind-screaming fury. Slipping his\r\ngas mask on, the man waited for the right moment to begin firing. The\r\nwhirlybird swooped down, the tank exploded in a fog, and the giant\r\nwobbled!\r\n\r\nDeCrabbe emptied all his weapons again. The bird arose, wobbling, its\r\nspeed greatly impaired, but making its getaway despite all he could do.\r\n\r\n"Damn well didn\'t coo that time," he said when the monster had reached\r\nthe horizon. "Next time won\'t fly either."\r\n\r\nBut just then the monstrous bird mocked him in the distance with a\r\nloud, sweet, "Coo! Coo!

"\r\n\r\nShortly after lunch he had it all set up. A new mannequin stood out in\r\nfront of the bandstand, its arms waving and a pair of slim, gleaming,\r\nten-gallon drums of stun gas nearby.\r\n\r\nIt was one o\'clock before the third whirlybird struck.\r\n\r\nDown it sank until it became a huge, ebony blot in the afternoon sky.\r\nUnderneath the bandstand roof DeCrabbe got ready for his supreme\r\neffort. He slipped on his gas mask and made sure his N-ray flashburn\r\ngun was ready for instant action, its safety off. He was determined\r\nthat if he got the bird prostrate he would climb aboard and fire N-ray\r\nbolts into it until something _gave_!\r\n\r\nThe huge black, wind-screaming monster plummeted the last few yards\r\ndown and grabbed the mannequin. Both tanks of stun gas exploded. The\r\ngiant whirlybird slumped unconscious--and DeCrabbe scrambled aboard!\r\n\r\nThe feverishly hurrying hunter was not long discovering why he had\r\nnot--and never would--penetrate the bird\'s feathers with any of his\r\nweapons: He burrowed down into the feathers the length of his arm and\r\nthere were yet more feathers beyond! A feather pillow would stop a\r\nrifle bullet, he knew, and this monster had the probable equivalent of\r\na thousand feather pillows protecting it, invulnerable as a battleship.\r\n\r\nAnd just then the maneater awoke, wobbled into the air, and flew away\r\nbefore DeCrabbe could get off!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following afternoon, as Five-gun Charles DeCrabbe made his farewell\r\nof the city of Featherton, he once more drove down the center of the\r\nstreet with the bubble of his space convertible slid back.\r\n\r\nYet there was a difference this time. The mayor and his son rode beside\r\nhim on the seat, and all of the people were now out of doors standing\r\nalong the curb, cheering their deliverer wildly as he passed.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t tell you how much I personally appreciate what you\'ve done for\r\nus," said the mayor humbly.\r\n\r\n"Quite quite quite!" returned Five-gun haughtily in his clipped speech,\r\nhoping to shut off the man\'s tendency toward windyness.\r\n\r\nWith awe in his voice the mayor\'s son admired, "So instead of being\r\nscared to death you were all ready for action when you and the\r\nwhirlybird landed at their rocky, mountain lair?"\r\n\r\n"Yes yes yes! 

Slid off its back, hid between two boulders, waited\r\nfor the appropriate moment. After bagging that one, waited for other\r\nmonsters as they landed, one by one. Bagged them."\r\n\r\n"Just like that!" said the youngster. "You just get up close enough for\r\nthose peoplehawks to grab you and then you bagged them."\r\n\r\n"Only possible way is my way," clipped DeCrabbe immovably.\r\n\r\n"Its eyes couldn\'t be buried deeply in feathers if they were to be of\r\nuse."\r\n\r\n"So?"\r\n\r\n"So eye is proximate to beak--and brain," said the hunter with dignity.\r\n"Where one of its _coo-coos_ came out, one of my N-ray bolts went in,\r\nand that was that!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


We girls have made up our minds."\r\n\r\nHugh Farrel, Chief Medical Officer of the Exodus VII, sighed and leaned\r\nback in his chair. He looked at Mary\'s husband. "And you, Ralph," he\r\nsaid. "How do you feel?"\r\n\r\nRalph Pornsen looked at Mary uncomfortably, started to speak and then\r\nhesitated.\r\n\r\nHugh Farrel sighed again and closed his eyes. It was that way with all\r\nthe boys. The wives had the whip hand. If the husbands put up an\r\nargument, they\'d simply get turned down flat: no sex at all, children or\r\notherwise. The threat, Farrel thought wryly, made the boys softer than\r\nwatered putty. His own wife, Alice, was one of the ringleaders of the\r\n"no babies" movement, and since he had openly declared warfare on the\r\nidea, she wouldn\'t even let him kiss her good-night. (For fear of losing\r\nher determination, Farrel liked to think.)\r\n\r\nHe opened his eyes again to look past the Pornsens, out of the curving\r\nport of his office-lab in the Exodus VII\'s flank, at the scene outside\r\nthe ship.\r\n\r\nAt the edge of the clearing he could see Danny Stern and his crew, tiny\r\nbeneath the cavernous sunbeam-shot overhang of giant leaves. Danny was\r\nstanding up at the controls of the \'dozer, waving his arms. His crew was\r\nstruggling to get a log set so he could shove it into place with the\r\n\'dozer. They were repairing a break in the barricade--the place where\r\none of New Earth\'s giant saurians had come stamping and whistling\r\nthrough last night to kill three colonists before it could be blasted\r\nout of existence.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult. Damned difficult. A brand-new world here, all ready\r\nto receive the refugees from dying Earth. Or rather, all ready to be\r\n_made_ ready, which was the task ahead of the Exodus VII\'s personnel.\r\n\r\nAn Earth-like world. Green, warm, fertile--and crawling, leaping,\r\nhooting and snarling with ferocious beasts of every variety. Farrel\r\ncould certainly see the women\'s point in banding together and refusing\r\nto produce children. Something inside a woman keeps her from wanting to\r\nbring life into peril--at least, when the peril seems temporary, and\r\nsecurity is both remembered and anticipated.\r\n\r\nPornsen said, "I guess I feel just about like Mary does. I--I don\'t see\r\nany reason for having a kid until we get this place ironed out and safe\r\nto live in."\r\n\r\n"That\'s going to take time, Ralph." Farrel clasped his hands in front of\r\nhim and delivered the speech he had delivered so often in the past few\r\nweeks. "Ten or twelve years before we really get set up here. We\'ve got\r\nto build from the ground up, you know. We\'ll have to find and mine our\r\nmetals. Build our machines to build shops to build more machines.\r\nThere\'ll be resources that we _won\'t_ find, and we\'ll have to learn what\r\nthis planet has to offer in their stead. Colonizing New Earth isn\'t\r\nsimply a matter of landing and throwing together a shining city. I only\r\nwish it were.\r\n\r\n"Six weeks ago we landed. We haven\'t yet dared to venture more than a\r\nmile from this spot. We\'ve cut down trees and built the barricade and\r\nour houses. After protecting ourselves we have to eat. We\'ve planted\r\ngardens. We\'ve produced test-tube calves and piglets. The calves are\r\ndoing fine, but the piglets are dying one by one. We\'ve got to find out\r\nwhy.\r\n\r\n"It\'s going to be a long, long time before we have even a minimum of\r\nsecurity, much less luxury. Longer than you think.... So much longer\r\nthat waiting until the security arrives before having children is out of\r\nthe question. There are critters out there--" he nodded toward the port\r\nand the busy clearing beyond--"that we haven\'t been able to kill. We\'ve\r\nthrown everything we have at them, and they come back for more. We\'ll\r\nhave to find out what _will_ kill them--how they differ from those we\r\n_are_ able to kill. We are six hundred people and a spaceship, Ralph. We\r\nhave techniques. That\'s _all_. Everything else we\'ve got to dig up out\r\nof this planet. We\'ll need people, Mary; we\'ll need the children. We\'re\r\ncounting on them. 

They\'re vital to the plans we\'ve made."\r\n\r\nMary Pornsen said, "Damn the plans. I won\'t have one. 

Not now. You\'ve\r\njust done a nice job of describing all my reasons. And all the other\r\ngirls feel the same way."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShe looked out the window at the \'dozer and crew. Danny Stern was still\r\nwaving his arms; the log was almost in place. "George and May Wright\r\nwere killed last night. So was Farelli. If George and May had had a\r\nchild, the monster would have trampled it too--it went right through\r\ntheir cabin like cardboard. It isn\'t fair to bring a baby into--"\r\n\r\nFarrel said, "Fair, Mary? Maybe it isn\'t fair _not_ to have one. _Not_\r\nto bring it into being and give it a chance. Life\'s always a gamble--"\r\n\r\n"_It_ doesn\'t exist," Mary said. She smiled. "Don\'t try circumlocution\r\non me, Doc. I\'m not religious. I don\'t believe that spermatozoa and an\r\novum, if not allowed to cuddle up together, add up to murder."\r\n\r\n"That isn\'t what I meant--"\r\n\r\n"You were getting around to it--which means you\'ve run out of good\r\narguments."\r\n\r\n"No. 

I\'ve a few left." Farrel looked at the two stubborn faces: Mary\'s,\r\npleasant and pretty, but set as steel; Ralph\'s, uncomfortable,\r\nthoughtful, but mirroring his definite willingness to follow his wife\'s\r\nlead.\r\n\r\nFarrel cleared his throat. "You know how important it is that this\r\ncolony be established? 

You know that, don\'t you? In twenty years or so\r\nthe ships will start arriving. Hundreds of them. Because we sent a\r\nmessage back to Earth saying we\'d found a habitable planet. Thousands of\r\npeople from Earth, coming here to the new world we\'re supposed to get\r\nbusy and carve out for them. We were selected for that task--first of\r\njudging the right planet, then of working it over. Engineers, chemists,\r\nagronomists, all of us--we\'re the task force. We\'ve got to do the job.\r\nWe\'ve got to test, plant, breed, re-balance, create. There\'ll be a lot\r\nof trial and error. We\'ve got to work out a way of life, so the\r\nthousands who will follow can be introduced safely and painlessly into\r\nthe--well, into the organism. And we\'ll need new blood for the jobs\r\nahead. We\'ll need young people--"\r\n\r\nMary said, "A few years one way or the other won\'t matter much, Doc.\r\nFive or six years from now this place will be a lot safer. Then we women\r\nwill start producing. But not now.

"\r\n\r\n"It won\'t work that way," Farrel said. "We\'re none of us kids any\r\nlonger. I\'m fifty-five. Ralph, you\'re forty-three. I realize that I must\r\nbe getting old to think of you as young. Mary, you\'re thirty-seven. We\r\ntook a long time getting here. 

Fourteen years. We left an Earth that\'s\r\ndying of radioactive poisoning, and we all got a mild dose of that. The\r\nradiation we absorbed in space, little as it was, didn\'t help any. And\r\nthat sun up there--" again he nodded at the port--"isn\'t any help\r\neither. Periodically it throws off some pretty damned funny stuff.\r\n\r\n"Frankly, we\'re worried. 

We don\'t know whether or not we _can_ have\r\nchildren. Or _normal_ children. We\'ve got to find out. If our genes have\r\nbeen bollixed up, we\'ve got to find out why and how and get to work on\r\nit immediately. It may be unpleasant. 

It may be heart-breaking. But\r\nthose who will come here in twenty years will have absorbed much more of\r\nEarth\'s radioactivity than we did, and an equal amount of the space\r\nstuff, and this sun will be waiting for them.... We\'ll have to know what\r\nwe can do for them."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not a walking laboratory, Doc," Mary said.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid you are, Mary. All of you are."\r\n\r\nMary set her lips and stared out the port.\r\n\r\n"It\'s got to be done, Mary."\r\n\r\nShe didn\'t answer.\r\n\r\n"It\'s going to be done."\r\n\r\n"Choose someone else," she said.\r\n\r\n"That\'s what they all say."\r\n\r\nShe said, "I guess this is one thing you doctors and psychologists\r\ndidn\'t figure on, Doc."\r\n\r\n"Not at first," Farrel said. "But we\'ve given it some thought."\r\n\r\nMacGuire had installed the button convenient to Farrel\'s right hand,\r\njust below the level of the desk-top. Farrel pressed it. 

Ralph and Mary\r\nPornsen slumped in their chairs. The door opened, and Doctor John J.\r\nMacGuire and Ted Harris, the Exodus VII\'s chief psychologist, came in.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen it was over, and the after-play had been allowed to run its course,\r\nFarrel told the Pornsens to go into the next room and shower. They came\r\nback soon, looking refreshed. 

Farrel ordered them to get back into their\r\nclothes. Under the power of the hypnotic drug which their chairs had\r\ninjected into them at the touch of the button, they did so. Then he told\r\nthem to sit down in the chairs again.\r\n\r\nMacGuire and Harris had gathered up their equipment, piling it on top of\r\nthe operating table.\r\n\r\nMacGuire smiled. "I\'ll bet that\'s the best-monitored, most hygienic sex\r\nact ever committed. I think I\'ve about got the space radiations effect\r\nlicked."\r\n\r\nFarrel nodded. "If anything goes wrong, it certainly won\'t be our fault.\r\nBut let\'s face it--the chances are a thousand to one that something\r\n_will_ go wrong. We\'ll just have to wait. 

And work." 

He looked at the\r\nPornsens. "They\'re very much in love, aren\'t they? And she was receptive\r\nto the suggestion--beneath it all, she was burning to have a child, just\r\nlike the others."\r\n\r\nMacGuire wheeled out the operating table, with its load of serums,\r\npressure-hypos and jury-rigged thingamabobs which he was testing on\r\nalternate couples. Ted Harris stopped at the door a moment. He said, "I\r\nthink the suggestions I planted will turn the trick when they find out\r\nshe\'s pregnant. They\'ll come through okay--won\'t even be too angry.

"\r\n\r\nFarrel sighed. They\'d been over it in detail several times, of course,\r\nbut apparently Harris needed the reassurance as much as he did. He said:\r\n"Sure. Now scram so I can go back into my act."\r\n\r\nHarris closed the door. Farrel sat down at his desk and studied the pair\r\nbefore him. They looked back contentedly, holding hands, their eyes\r\ndull.\r\n\r\nFarrel said, "How do you feel?"\r\n\r\nRalph Pornsen said, "I feel fine."\r\n\r\nMary Pornsen said, "Oh, I feel _wonderful_!"\r\n\r\nDeliberately Farrel pressed another button below his desk-top.\r\n\r\nThe dull eyes cleared instantly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you\'ve given it some thought, Doc?" Mary said sweetly. "And what\r\nhave you decided?"\r\n\r\n"You\'ll see," Farrel said. "Eventually."\r\n\r\nHe rose. "That\'s all for now, kids. I\'d like to see you again in one\r\nmonth--for a routine check-up."\r\n\r\nMary nodded and got up. "You\'ll still have to wait, Doc. Why not admit\r\nyou\'re licked?"\r\n\r\nRalph got up too, and looked puzzled.\r\n\r\n"Wow," he said. "I\'m tired."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps just coming here," Farrel said, "discharged some of the tension\r\nyou\'ve been carrying around."\r\n\r\nThe Pornsens left.\r\n\r\nFarrel brought out some papers from his desk and studied them. Then,\r\nfrom the file drawer, he selected the record of Hugh and Alice Farrel.\r\nAlice would be at the perfect time of her menstrual cycle tomorrow....\r\n\r\nFarrel flipped his communicator.\r\n\r\n"MacGuire," he said. "Tomorrow it\'s me."\r\n\r\nMacGuire chuckled. Farrel could have kicked him. He put his chin in his\r\nhands and stared out the port. Danny Stern had the log in place in the\r\nbarricade. The bulldozer was moving on to a new task. His momentary\r\ndoubt stilled, Farrel went back to work.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwenty-one years later, when the ships from Earth began arriving, the\r\nlog had been replaced by a stone monument erected to the memory of the\r\nExodus VII, which had been cut apart for its valuable steel. Around the\r\nmonument was a park, and on three sides of the park was a shining\r\ntown--not really large enough to be called a city--of plastic and stone,\r\nfor New Earth had no iron ore, only zinc and a little copper. This was\r\noften cause for regret.\r\n\r\nStill it was a pretty good world. The monster problem had been licked by\r\nhigh-voltage cannon. Now in their third generation since the landing,\r\nthe monsters kept their distance. And things grew--things good to eat.\r\n\r\nAnd even without steel, the graceful, smoothly-functioning town looked\r\nimpressive--quite a thing to have been built by a handful of beings with\r\ntwo arms and two legs each.\r\n\r\nIt hadn\'t been, entirely. But nobody thought much about that any more.\r\nEven the newcomers got used to it. Things change.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _If Worlds of Science Fiction_ November\r\n    1953.

]\r\n\r\n\r\nMy wife don\'t believe me. That\'s why she made me come here, and I\r\ndon\'t think you\'re gonna believe me, either, but it\'s the God\'s honest\r\ntruth--and the money\'s mine.\r\n\r\nHell, I wouldn\'t never steal. I know there\'s a lotta fellas in my fix\r\nthat do, but not me. I always been honest, and always got along okay.\r\n\r\nExcuse me, but are you takin\' this down just the way I\'m tellin\' it?\r\nCuz I can\'t talk so good, ain\'t had much schoolin\', and I want this\r\ntook down just like I\'m tellin\' it, cuz it\'s gonna he hard enough to\r\nbelieve.\r\n\r\nOkay, thanks.\r\n\r\nThe whole thing started yesterday mornin\'. I went out early cuz my wife\r\nwas sick and I wanted to try and get as much as I could by myself, in\r\ncase there gonna be doctor bills. And it\'s a lot tougher goin\' it\r\nalone, counta my wife plays the banjo, and that\'s a big help.\r\n\r\nWell, the subway take on the way up from Brooklyn was pretty poor, so\r\nI got off at Columbus Circle and headed for the Park. I figgered, it\r\nbein\' the Fourth of July holiday, there\'d be pretty good pickin\'s there.\r\n\r\nBut hell, I never figgered it was gonna be _that_ good!\r\n\r\nI had a little trouble gettin\' acrost Fifty-ninth Street--you know,\r\nwhere they been doin\' all that diggin\'?--and I took a bad spill there.\r\nMy crutches slipped on that damn gravel they got spread all over the\r\nplace. I don\'t usu\'ly have trouble navigatin\' that way, but this\r\nmornin\' I was still kinda sleepy and wasn\'t watchin\' myself enough.\r\n\r\nYeah, I went right on my ear--that\'s how I got this cut here. As if I\r\nain\'t had enough trouble there.\r\n\r\nThis real nice guy come runnin\' over and helps me up. He talked real\r\nfunny, sorta with his teeth, like. I couldn\'t make out a thing he said.\r\nA furriner, I figgered.\r\n\r\nThen when we get to the curb, he takes off like a bat outta hell into\r\nthe park. That\'s when I noticed he was dressed kinda funny, too. 

Like\r\nthe creases on his pants was on the _sides_, and his jacket was on\r\nbackwards, and he didn\'t have no shoes on. Just some kinda floppy red\r\nsocks, it looked like, with a lotta yella tassels on \'em.\r\n\r\nMust be a character from the Village, I figgered. I seen a lotta queer\r\nducks down there in my time.\r\n\r\nThen I forgot about him, cuz I spotted a coupla young kids sittin\' on\r\nthe stone bench near the gate, and they looked like a good touch. So I\r\ndusts off my hat and gives \'em a try.\r\n\r\nBut they was still lookin\' pop-eyed towards the park where the funny\r\ncharacter went, and didn\'t give me a tumble atall. So I moved along\r\ninto the park, and to hell with \'em.\r\n\r\nThere was only a coupla bums sleepin\' on the benches near the gate, and\r\nI went on up the grade and around the bend. It was slow goin\' uphill,\r\nand my leg was hurtin\', but when I fin\'ly got there, all the benches on\r\nboth sides of the walk was empty.\r\n\r\nI thought, Hell, I\'m _too_ early. But I kept on goin\', even though my\r\nshoulders was startin\' to hurt now. I didn\'t wanna grab a rest till I\r\ntook in a coupla bucks, at least.\r\n\r\nThe ground levels off there, and it was easier goin\', so I tried to get\r\nup a little speed, rememberin\' there was a place up ahead where people\r\nalways sit on the grass and get the sun.\r\n\r\nAnd all the way, the benches was empty and not a soul in sight\r\nnowheres. I was thinkin\' maybe there was some kinda celebratin\' goin\'\r\non and I oughta been goin\' up towards the Mall. But I knew it was too\r\nearly for anythin\' like that, so I kept on goin\'.\r\n\r\nAnd a damn good thing I did. Cuz when I reached that big field--you\r\nknow, where the road cuts off?--there was a fair-sized crowd standin\'\r\naround there.\r\n\r\nThey was all lookin\' off towards the middle of the field. But I\r\ncouldn\'t make out from where I was what was goin\' on, and I didn\'t care\r\nmuch, anyways, cuz I don\'t care nothin\' \'bout them parades and stuff.\r\nSo I just started makin\' my rounds.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWell, it was the damndest thing I ever seen! All them people started\r\nshellin\' out soon as I came up to \'em--without even lookin\' at me! I\r\nthought I was gonna pass out right there, seein\' all them green-backs\r\nfloppin\' into my hat.\r\n\r\nOne guy threw in wallet and all!\r\n\r\nLookin\' at these crazy people, I seen they was all talkin\'. And they\r\nlooked like they was talkin\' to theirselves, cuz nobody turned a head,\r\njust kept starin\', all glassy-eyed, like they was doped up.\r\n\r\nThe old guy that threw in his whole wallet was sayin\' somethin\'\r\nlike: "This is the finest performance of scar-laddy I\'ve ever heard.\r\nPositively brilliant!" There was a skinny kid standin\' next to the old\r\ngent, and his lips was movin\' fast. 

"Jeepers!" he was sayin\', "real\r\ndixieland." And his buddy was standin\' there, tappin\' his feet and\r\nyellin\', "_Hear_ that boogie beat! Man! That\'s Albert Ammons and Pete\r\nJohnson at their best!"\r\n\r\nA little ways in, a fat guy, standin\' on somebody\'s panama hat, says,\r\n"Show-pan! I just _love_ show-pan." His big, flabby lips was slappin\'\r\ntogether hard. The big, chesty old lady with him had one o\' them little\r\nwrinkled-up mouths, and I could hardly make out what she was sayin\',\r\ncuz her lips didn\'t hardly move at all when she talked, but it was\r\nsomethin\' like, "Chambah music, my deah. _So_ lovely.

"\r\n\r\nEv\'rybody\'s mouth was goin\'--ev\'rybody I looked at was sayin\' somethin\'\r\nabout music. And they all looked like they was havin\' the time of their\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nAnd they kept right on shellin\' out as I moved along through \'em!\r\n\r\nThen I gets to the edge of the crowd, and I spot what they\'re all\r\nstarin\' at--it\'s nobody but my old friend, Queerpants, the nice guy\r\nthat helped me on Fifty-ninth Street when I took that spill!\r\n\r\nHe\'s standin\' out there in the middle o\' the field with his back to\r\nthe crowd, wavin\' his arms around like crazy. Looked just like he was\r\nleadin\' a band. Queerest thing I ever seen--cuz there ain\'t nothin\' in\r\nfront o\' him, exceptin\' trees and grass.\r\n\r\nA coupla minutes later, he throws his hands down, like he\'s stoppin\'\r\nsomethin\', and then he turns around towards the crowd and bends over\r\nreal low.\r\n\r\nAnd the crowd goes nuts. Their mouths are wide open, screamin\' and\r\nyellin\', and they\'re clappin\' their hands like they was at a circus or\r\nsomethin\'.\r\n\r\nQueerpants bends over a couple times more, then he swings around again,\r\nsorta taps the air in front o\' him, stretches his arms up over his head\r\nfor a second, and then starts slingin\' \'em around again.\r\n\r\nRight away, everybody shuts their traps and goes to starin\' again.\r\nThey all look like they been cryin\'--but happy like.\r\n\r\nI\'m standin\' there, tryin\' to figger how maybe it\'s some kinda gag, and\r\nthere\'s maybe a band hidin\' back in the trees or somethin\' like that,\r\nwhen outta the corner o\' my eye I spots this cop comin\' towards me.\r\n\r\nI ducks back into the crowd real fast and starts stuffin\' all the dough\r\ninto my pockets. Soon\'s the hat\'s empty, I takes a peek back through\r\nthe crowd, and there\'s the blue-coat, rockin\' back on his heels with a\r\nbig grin spread on his fat face.\r\n\r\nThis, I hadda see, so I moves over, real quiet like, and his mouth is\r\ngoin\' like sixty. "It\'s the old Killarney," he\'s sayin\', "Bejasus!\r\nOi\'ve niver heard the like. Me poor old mither should be here now. God\r\n_bless_ the man!

"\r\n\r\nAnd all the time, the crowd\'s gettin\' bigger and bigger. Cars stop\r\nalong the road, a couple people ride over on horses, two women with\r\nbaby carriages pushes in, and a big guy with glasses, carryin\' about\r\nten books, drops them on the grass and starts clenchin\' his fists.\r\n\r\nNow I see Queerpants is takin\' a bow again, and ev\'rybody\'s beatin\'\r\ntheir hands.\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden, Queerpants jumps around and takes off towards the\r\nwoods, hoppin\' across the grass like a rabbit, and wavin\' his arms\r\naround again as he goes.\r\n\r\nLucky I\'m on the outside, or I woulda been trampled. It was like\r\nsomebody yelled "Fire!" 

in a movie. The whole mob beats it across the\r\ngrass, knockin\' into each other, ev\'rybody tryin\' to get ahead.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI let \'em go and went back to the sidewalk. I know where that woods\r\nlets out; it leads right back to Central Park West, and it\'s the long\r\nway around. I can easy beat \'em by goin\' up the sidewalk.\r\n\r\nAnd I do. I\'m already waitin\' outside when Queerpants comes hoppin\' out\r\nwith the whole mob runnin\' after him. Looks like they picked up lots\r\nmore people on the way, cuz now there\'s hundreds followin\' him.\r\n\r\nI damn near chokes when Queerpants jumps the red light. But traffic\r\njust stops dead for him, brakes jammin\' up and down the street for\r\nabout a mile.\r\n\r\nHe\'s headin\' straight crosstown towards the river, it looks like, and\r\nI\'m thinkin\', damn, this I gotta see. But I can\'t figger no way to\r\ncatch up with \'em.\r\n\r\nThen I see the traffic on the other side of the street is startin\' to\r\nturn right in after the tail-end o\' the mob. And the same thing starts\r\non my side, ev\'rybody tryin\' to go down that side street at the same\r\ntime. And ev\'rybody punchin\' their horns like crazy.\r\n\r\nAbout four cars down from where I\'m standin\', there\'s a taxi in the\r\nline. So, neat as you please, I goes down, opens his door and climbs in.\r\n\r\nThe cabby don\'t even see me. In his mirror, I can see his face is red\r\nas a beet, and he\'s yellin\' and cussin\' and beatin\' on his hornbutton.\r\n\r\nWell, I pulls the door shut and make myself comfy. Then, all of a\r\nsudden, we start movin\'. As we cut around the corner, I see how we got\r\nour break--there\'s two cars locked bumpers in the other lane, holdin\'\r\nup the whole line.\r\n\r\nNow we\'re goin\' straight crosstown at a pretty good clip. At Amsterdam,\r\nwe swing uptown, up a big hill, and when we get to the top, I can see\r\nthe crowd still racing along like mad.\r\n\r\nWay uptown, somewhere near a Hundred and Twenty-fifth, we turn west,\r\nrun down under the Express Highway, and end up in front of a beat-up\r\nold dock.\r\n\r\nThere\'s hundreds of cars parked all over the place with their doors\r\nopen and their engines runnin\', and ev\'rybody\'s racin\' toward the river.\r\n\r\nMy driver was out before the cab hardly stopped. It took me a little\r\nwhile to get out. 

Then I had to be real careful navigatin\' that old\r\nwharf. It was full of holes and big cracks and piles of junk lyin\'\r\naround.\r\n\r\nSlow goin\'. I was pretty beat by the time I reached the mob near the\r\nend o\' the wharf.\r\n\r\nThey was two long lines of \'em, movin\' along slow. Up ahead, they was\r\nall goin\' up a big red ramp that went up into the air off the dock and\r\ninto a great big thing that was hangin\' in the air over the river. The\r\nthing looked like a big banana made outta glass.\r\n\r\nWhen I got nearer, I could see right into the thing.\r\n\r\nInside it, there was a lotta little stalls, and people was all crowdin\'\r\ninto \'em, about four or five to a stall. As soon as they got in, a\r\nkinda door dropped down and I couldn\'t see no way that they could get\r\nout.\r\n\r\nBut it didn\'t look like anybody was _tryin\'_ to get out.\r\n\r\nThere was a big round table in each stall, with a lotta food on \'em,\r\nand the people was standin\' around just eatin\' like pigs in a sty.\r\n\r\nAll the time I was watchin\', people kept pilin\' into the thing, lookin\'\r\nlike they was singin\' their heads off. Some was clappin\' their hands\r\nand throwin\' their arms around, like they was doin\' some kinda dance.\r\n\r\nFor about an hour, people kept marchin\' up that ramp, until fin\'ly the\r\nend of the line came, and they all got in--exceptin\' the last one. A\r\nreal skinny old man with a cane.\r\n\r\nJust as he got up to the top of the ramp, the hole in the side of the\r\nbanana closed up, quick as a wink.\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden, the thing starts to go straight up into the air,\r\nleavin\' the old man standin\' there at the edge of the ramp, wavin\' his\r\ncane.\r\n\r\nNext thing the old man goes over the edge and drops into the river.\r\n\r\nThe banana-lookin\' thing keeps goin\' up into the air, goin\' faster and\r\nfaster, and shinin\' like a mirror. Smaller and smaller it gets, and\r\nthen--bop--it\'s gone.\r\n\r\nGoin\' back to the street, I was feelin\' sick. 

It was like ev\'rybody in\r\nthe world was crazy except me. I felt _lonesome_.\r\n\r\nAnd all those cars, parked ev\'ry which-way, with their doors open and\r\ntheir motors runnin\'--it was real scary.\r\n\r\nWell, I got outta there as fast as I could go and took the subway home.\r\nAnd my wife wouldn\'t believe me when she seen all that dough.\r\n\r\nBut it\'s the truth, and I figger the only reason they didn\'t get me,\r\nwhoever they was, is because I\'m stone-deaf and couldn\'t hear that\r\nguy\'s funny music.\r\n\r\nDo I get to keep the money, Yer Honor?\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


He had been employed for more than\r\nfifteen years in the same pursuit of happiness, in the same house, same\r\nlaboratory, and attended by the same servant woman, who in her long\r\nperiod of service had attained the plumpness and respectability of two\r\nhundred and ninety pounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The electric current lighted up everything in sight!]\r\n\r\n"Mag Nesia," called the professor. The servant\'s name was Maggie\r\nNesia--Professor Carbonic had contracted the title to save time, for in\r\nfifteen years he had not mounted the heights of greatness; he must work\r\nharder and faster as life is short, and eliminate such shameful waste\r\nof time as putting the "gie" on Maggie.\r\n\r\n"Mag Nesia!" the professor repeated.\r\n\r\nThe old woman rolled slowly into the room.\r\n\r\n"Get rid of these and bring the one the boy brought today."\r\n\r\nHe handed her a tray containing three dead rats, whose brains had been\r\nsubjected to analysis.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Marse," answered Mag Nesia in a tone like citrate.\r\n\r\nThe professor busied himself with a new preparation of zinc oxide and\r\ncopper sulphate and sal ammoniac, his latest concoction, which was about\r\nto be used and, like its predecessors, to be abandoned.\r\n\r\nMag Nesia appeared bringing another rat, dead. The professor made no\r\nexperiments on live animals. He had hired a boy in the neighborhood to\r\nbring him fresh dead rats at twenty-five cents per head.\r\n\r\nTaking the tray he prepared a hypodermic filled with the new\r\npreparation. Carefully he made an incision above the right eye of the\r\ncarcass through the bone. He lifted the hypodermic, half hopelessly,\r\nhalf expectantly. The old woman watched him, as she had done many times\r\nbefore, with always the same pitiful expression. Pitiful, either for the\r\nman himself or for the dead rat. Mag Nesia seldom expressed her views.\r\n\r\nInserting the hypodermic needle and injecting the contents of the\r\nsyringe, Professor Carbonic stepped back.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Prof. Carbonic Makes a Great Discovery_\r\n\r\n"Great Saints!" His voice could have been heard a mile. Slowly the rat\'s\r\ntail began to point skyward; and as slowly Mag Nesia began to turn\r\nwhite. Professor Carbonic stood as paralyzed. The rat trembled and moved\r\nhis feet. The man of sixty years made one jump with the alacrity of a\r\nboy of sixteen, he grabbed the enlivened animal, and held it high above\r\nhis head as he jumped about the room.\r\n\r\nSpying the servant, who until now had seemed unable to move, he threw\r\nboth arms around her, bringing the rat close to her face. Around the\r\nlaboratory they danced to the tune of the woman\'s shrieks. The professor\r\nheld on, and the woman yelled. Up and down spasmodically on the\r\nlaboratory floor came the two hundred and ninety pounds with the\r\nprofessor thrown in.\r\n\r\nBottles tumbled from the shelves. Furniture was upset. 

Precious liquids\r\nflowed unrestrained and unnoticed. Finally the professor dropped with\r\nexhaustion and the rat and Mag Nesia made a dash for freedom.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning pedestrians on Arlington Avenue were attracted by a\r\nsign in brilliant letters.\r\n\r\nProfessor Carbonic early in the morning betook himself to the nearest\r\nhardware store and purchased the tools necessary for his new profession.\r\nHe was an M.D. and his recently acquired knowledge put him in a position\r\nto startle the world. 

Having procured what he needed he returned home.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThings were developing fast. Mag Nesia met him at the door and told him\r\nthat Sally Soda, who was known to the neighborhood as Sal or Sal Soda\r\ngenerally, had fallen down two flights of stairs, and to use her own\r\nwords was "Putty bad." Sal Soda\'s mother, in sending for a doctor, had\r\nread the elaborate sign of the new enemy of death, and begged that he\r\ncome to see Sal as soon as he returned.\r\n\r\nBidding Mag Nesia to accompany him, he went to the laboratory and\r\nsecured his precious preparation. Professor Carbonic and the unwilling\r\nMag Nesia started out to put new life into a little Sal Soda who lived\r\nin the same block.\r\n\r\nReaching the house they met the family physician then attendant on\r\nlittle Sal. Doctor X. Ray had also read the sign of the professor and\r\nhis greeting was very chilly.\r\n\r\n"How is the child?" asked the professor.\r\n\r\n"Fatally hurt and can live but an hour." Then he added, "I have done all\r\nthat can be done."\r\n\r\n"All that _you_ can do," corrected the professor.\r\n\r\nWith a withering glance, Doctor X. Ray left the room and the house. His\r\nreputation was such as to admit of no intrusion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"I am sorry she is not dead, it would be easier to work, and also a more\r\nreasonable charge." Giving Mag Nesia his instruments he administered a\r\nlocal anesthetic; this done he selected a brace and bit that he had\r\nprocured that morning. With these instruments he bored a small hole into\r\nthe child\'s head. Inserting his hypodermic needle, he injected the\r\nimmortal fluid, then cutting the end off a dowel, which he had also\r\nprocured that morning, he hammered it into the hole until it wedged\r\nitself tight.\r\n\r\nProfessor Carbonic seated himself comfortably and awaited the action of\r\nhis injection, while the plump Mag Nesia paced or rather waddled the\r\nfloor with a bag of carpenter\'s tools under her arm.\r\n\r\nThe fluid worked. The child came to and sat up. Sal Soda had regained\r\nher pep.\r\n\r\n"It will be one dollar and twenty-five cents, Mrs. Soda," apologized the\r\nprofessor. "I have to make that charge as it is so inconvenient to work\r\non them when they are still alive."\r\n\r\nHaving collected his fee, the professor and Mag Nesia departed, amid the\r\never rising blessings of the Soda family.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt 3:30 P.M. Mag Nesia sought her employer, who was asleep in the\r\nsitting room.\r\n\r\n"Marse Paul, a gentleman to see you."\r\n\r\nThe professor awoke and had her send the man in.\r\n\r\nThe man entered hurriedly, hat in hand. "Are you Professor Carbonic?"\r\n\r\n"I am, what can I do for you?

"\r\n\r\n"Can you----?" 

the man hesitated. "My friend has just been killed in an\r\naccident. You couldn\'t----" he hesitated again.\r\n\r\n"I know that it is unbelievable," answered the professor. "But I can."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nProfessor Carbonic for some years had suffered from the effects of a\r\nweak heart. His fears on this score had recently been entirely relieved.\r\nHe now had the prescription--Death no more! The startling discovery, and\r\nthe happenings of the last twenty-four hours had begun to take effect on\r\nhim, and he did not wish to make another call until he was feeling\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go," said the professor after a period of musing. "My discoveries\r\nare for the benefit of the human race, I must not consider myself."\r\n\r\nHe satisfied himself that he had all his tools. He had just sufficient\r\nof the preparation for one injection; this, he thought, would be enough;\r\nhowever, he placed in his case, two vials of different solutions, which\r\nwere the basis of his discovery. These fluids had but to be mixed, and\r\nafter the chemical reaction had taken place the preparation was ready\r\nfor use.\r\n\r\nHe searched the house for Mag Nesia, but the old servant had made it\r\ncertain that she did not intend to act as nurse to dead men on their\r\njourney back to life. Reluctantly he decided to go without her.\r\n\r\n"How is it possible!" exclaimed the stranger, as they climbed into the\r\nwaiting machine.\r\n\r\n"I have worked for fifteen years before I found the solution," answered\r\nthe professor slowly.\r\n\r\n"I cannot understand on what you could have based a theory for\r\nexperimenting on something that has been universally accepted as\r\nimpossible of solution."\r\n\r\n"With electricity, all is possible; as I have proved." Seeing the\r\nskeptical look his companion assumed, he continued, "Electricity is the\r\nbasis of every motive power we have; it is the base of every formation\r\nthat we know." The professor was warming to the subject.\r\n\r\n"Go on," said the stranger, "I am extremely interested."\r\n\r\n"Every sort of heat that is known, whether dormant or active, is only\r\none arm of the gigantic force electricity. The most of our knowledge of\r\nelectricity has been gained through its offspring, magnetism. A body\r\nentirely devoid of electricity, is a body dead. Magnetism is apparent in\r\nmany things including the human race, and its presence in many people is\r\nprominent."\r\n\r\n"But how did this lead to your experiments?"\r\n\r\n"If magnetism or motive force, is the offspring of electricity, the\r\nhuman body must, and does contain electricity. That we use more\r\nelectricity than the human body will induce is a fact; it is apparent\r\ntherefore that a certain amount of electricity must be generated within\r\nthe human body, and without aid of any outside forces. Science has known\r\nfor years that the body\'s power is brought into action through the\r\nbrain. The brain is our generator. The little cells and the fluid that\r\nseparate them, have the same action as the liquid of a wet battery; like\r\na wet battery this fluid wears out and we must replace the fluid or the\r\nsal ammoniac or we lose the use of the battery or body. I have\r\ndiscovered what fluid to use that will produce the electricity in the\r\nbrain cells which the human body is unable to induce."\r\n\r\n"We are here," said the stranger as he brought the car to a stop at the\r\ncurb.\r\n\r\n"You are still a skeptic," noting the voice of the man. "But you shall\r\nsee shortly.

"\r\n\r\nThe man led him into the house and introduced him to Mrs. Murray Attic,\r\nwho conducted him to the room where the deceased Murray Attic was laid.\r\n\r\nWithout a word the professor began his preparations. He was ill, and\r\nwould have preferred to have been at rest in his own comfortable house.\r\nHe would do the work quickly and get away.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSelecting a gimlet, he bored a hole through the skull of the dead man;\r\ninserting his hypodermic he injected all the fluid he had mixed. He had\r\nnot calculated on the size of the gimlet and the dowels he carried would\r\nnot fit the hole. As a last resource he drove in his lead pencil, broke\r\nit off close, and carefully cut the splinters smooth with the head.\r\n\r\n"It will be seventy-five cents, madam," said the professor as he\r\nfinished the work.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMrs. Murray Attic paid the money unconsciously; she did not know whether\r\nhe was embalming her husband or just trying the keenness of his new\r\ntools. The death had been too much for her.\r\n\r\nThe minutes passed and still the dead man showed no signs of reviving.\r\nProfessor Carbonic paced the floor in an agitated manner. He began to be\r\ndoubtful of his ability to bring the man back. Worried, he continued his\r\ntramp up and down the room. 

His heart was affecting him. He was tempted\r\nto return the seventy-five cents to the prostrate wife when--THE DEAD\r\nMAN MOVED!\r\n\r\nThe professor clasped his hands to his throat, and with his head thrown\r\nback dropped to the floor. A fatal attack of the heart.\r\n\r\nHe became conscious quickly. "The bottles there," he whispered. 

"Mix--,\r\nmake injection." He became unconscious again.\r\n\r\nThe stranger found the gimlet and bored a hole in the professor\'s head,\r\nhastily seizing one of the vials, he poured the contents into the deeply\r\nmade hole. He then realized that there was another bottle.\r\n\r\n"Mix them!" shrieked the almost hysterical woman.\r\n\r\nIt was too late, the one vial was empty, and the professor\'s body lay\r\nlifeless.\r\n\r\nIn mental agony the stranger grasped the second vial and emptied its\r\ncontents also into the professor\'s head, and stopped the hole with the\r\ncork.\r\n\r\nMiraculously Professor Carbonic opened his eyes, and rose to his feet.\r\nHis eyes were like balls of fire; his lips moved inaudibly, and as they\r\nmoved little blue sparks were seen to pass from one to another. His hair\r\nstood out from his head. 

The chemical reaction was going on in the\r\nprofessor\'s brain, with a dose powerful enough to restore ten men. He\r\ntottered slightly.\r\n\r\nMurray Attic, now thoroughly alive, sat up straight in bed. He grasped\r\nthe brass bed post with one hand and stretched out the other to aid the\r\nstaggering man.\r\n\r\nHe caught his hand; both bodies stiffened; a slight crackling sound was\r\naudible; a blue flash shot from where Attic\'s had made contact with the\r\nbed post; then a dull thud as both bodies struck the floor.

"\r\n\r\n"No," Mr. Ritchie said, "I am _not_ \'just terribly upset, dear\'--for\r\nseven years I\'ve been listening to that banshee\'s wail every time\r\nsomebody wants in. Well, I\'m through. Either it goes--"\r\n\r\n"All right, all _right_," Mrs. Ritchie said. "You don\'t have to make a\r\nproduction out of it."\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"Well what?"\r\n\r\nMr. Ritchie sighed ponderously, glared at his wife, set what was left\r\nof the martini down on a table and went to the door. He slipped the\r\nchain.\r\n\r\n"Be this the marster of \'arfway \'ouse?"\r\n\r\nMr. Ritchie opened the door. "Max--what the devil are you doing up at\r\nthis hour?"\r\n\r\nA large man, well built, in his forties, walked in, smiling. "I could\r\nask you the same question," he said, flinging his hat and scarf in the\r\ndirection of a chair, "but I\'m far too thoughtful."\r\n\r\nThey went back into the living room. 

Mrs. Ritchie looked up, frowned.\r\n"Oh, swell," she said. "Dandy. All we need now is a bridge four."\r\n\r\n"Ruth\'s just terribly upset," Mr. Ritchie said.\r\n\r\n"Well," the large man said, "it\'s nice to see unanimity in this house\r\nfor once anyway. Hi, Ruth." He walked over to the bar and found the\r\nmartini mix and drained the jar\'s contents into a glass. Then he\r\ndrained the glass.\r\n\r\n"Hey, take it easy!"\r\n\r\nMax Kaplan turned to face his hosts. He looked quite a bit older than\r\nusual: the grin wasn\'t boyish now. "Dear folkses," he said, "when I\r\ndie, I don\'t want to see any full bottles around."\r\n\r\n"Oh, ha-ha, that\'s just so very deliriously funny," Mrs. Ritchie said.\r\nShe was massaging her temples.\r\n\r\n"I am glad to see her ladyship amused." Kaplan followed Mr. 

Ritchie\'s\r\ngaze. "Hickory dickory dock, the mice looked at the clock...."\r\n\r\n"Oh, shut up."\r\n\r\n"Oop, sorry." The big man mixed up a new batch silently, then refilled\r\nthe three glasses. He sat down. The clock\'s tick, a deep sharp bass\r\nsound, got louder and louder in the room. Kaplan rested his head on the\r\ncouch arm. "Less than an hour," he said. "Not even an hour--"\r\n\r\n"I knew it." Mrs. Ritchie stood up. "I knew it the minute you walked\r\nin. We\'re not nervous enough, oh, no, now we\'ve got to listen to the\r\ngreat city editor and his news behind the news."\r\n\r\n"Very well!" 

Kaplan rose shakily. He was drunk; it showed now. "If I\'m\r\nnot welcome here, then I shall go elsewhere to breathe my last."\r\n\r\n"Never mind," Mrs. Ritchie said. "Sit down. I\'ve had a stomach full of\r\nthis wake. If you two insist on sitting up until X-hour like a couple\r\nof ghouls, well, that\'s your business. I\'m going to bed. 

And to sleep."\r\n\r\n"What a woman," Kaplan muttered, polishing off the martini. "Nerves of\r\nchilled steel."\r\n\r\nMrs. Ritchie looked at her husband for a moment. Then she said, "Good\r\nnight, dear," and started for the door.\r\n\r\n"See you in the morning," Mr. Ritchie said. "Get a good sleep."\r\n\r\nThen Max Kaplan giggled. "Yeah, a real good sleep."\r\n\r\nMrs. Ritchie left the room.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe big man fumbled for a cigarette. He glanced at the clock. "Hank,\r\nfor Chrissake--"\r\n\r\nHenry Ritchie sighed and slumped in the chair. "I tried, Max."\r\n\r\n"Did you? Did you try--I mean with everything?"\r\n\r\n"With everything. Might as well face it: the boy\'s going to burn, right\r\non schedule."\r\n\r\nKaplan opened his mouth.\r\n\r\n"Forget it. The governor isn\'t about to issue a commutation. With the\r\npublic\'s blood up the way it is, he knows what it would mean to his\r\nvote. 

We were stupid even to try."\r\n\r\n"Lousy vultures."\r\n\r\nRitchie shrugged. "They\'re hungry, Max. You forget, there hasn\'t been\r\nan execution in this state for over two years. They\'re hungry."\r\n\r\n"So a poor dumb kid\'s got to fry alive in order for them to get their\r\nkicks...."\r\n\r\n"Wait a second now. Don\'t get carried away. This same poor dumb kid is\r\nthe boy who killed George Sanderson in cold blood and then raped his\r\nwife, not too very long ago. If I recall, your word for him then was\r\nBrutal Murderer."\r\n\r\n"That was the paper. This is you and me."\r\n\r\n"Well, get that accusatory look off your face. Murder and rape--those\r\nare stiff raps to beat, pal."\r\n\r\n"You did it with Beatty, you got him off," Kaplan reminded his friend.\r\n\r\n"Luck. Public mood--Beatty was an old man, feeble. Look, Max--why don\'t\r\nyou stop beating around the bush?"\r\n\r\n"Okay," Kaplan said slowly. "They--let me in this afternoon. I talked\r\nwith him again."\r\n\r\nRitchie nodded. 

"And?"\r\n\r\n"Hank, I\'m telling you--it gives me the creeps. I swear it does.

"\r\n\r\n"What did he tell you?"\r\n\r\nKaplan puffed on his cigarette nervously, kept his eyes on the clock.\r\n"He was lying down when I went in, curled up tight. Trying to sleep."\r\n\r\n"Go on."\r\n\r\n"When he heard me, he came to. \'Mr. Kaplan,\' he says, \'you\'ve got to\r\nmake them believe me, you\'ve got to make them understand--\' His eyes\r\ngot real big then, and--Hank, I\'m scared."\r\n\r\n"Of what?

"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. Just him, maybe. I\'m not sure."\r\n\r\n"He carrying the same line?"\r\n\r\n"Yeah. But worse this time, more intense somehow...."\r\n\r\nRitchie tried to keep the smile. He remembered, all right. 

Much too\r\nwell. The whole story was crazy, normally enough to get the kid off\r\nwith a life sentence in the criminally insane ward. But it was a little\r\n_too_ crazy, so the psychiatrists wouldn\'t buy.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t get his words out of my mind," Kaplan was saying. His eyes were\r\nclosed. 

"\'Mister, tell them, tell them. If you kill me, then you\'ll all\r\ndie. This whole world of yours will die....\'"\r\n\r\n_Because_, Ritchie remembered, _you don\'t exist, any of you, except in\r\nmy mind. Don\'t you see? I\'m asleep and dreaming all this. You, your\r\nwives, your children, it\'s all part of my dream--and when you kill me\r\nthen I\'ll wake up and that will be the end of you...._\r\n\r\n"Well," Ritchie said, "it\'s original."\r\n\r\nKaplan shook his head.\r\n\r\n"Come on, Max, snap out of it. You act like you never listened to a\r\nlunatic before. People have been predicting the end of the world ever\r\nsince Year 1."\r\n\r\n"Sure, I know. 

You don\'t have to patronize me. It\'s just that--well,\r\nwho _is_ this particular lunatic anyway? We don\'t know any more about\r\nhim than the day he was caught. Even the name we had to make up. Who is\r\nhe, where\'d he come from, what\'s his home?"\r\n\r\n_My home ... a world of eternities, an eternity of worlds.... I must\r\ndestroy, hurt, kill before I wake always ... and then once more I must\r\nsleep ... always, always...._\r\n\r\n"Look, there\'s a hundred vagrants in every city. Just like our boy: no\r\nname, no friends, no relatives."\r\n\r\n"Then he doesn\'t seem in the least odd to you, is that it? Is that what\r\nyou\'re telling me?"\r\n\r\n"So he\'s odd! I never met a murderer that wasn\'t!" Ritchie recalled the\r\nlean hairless face, the expressionless eyes, the slender youthful body\r\nthat moved in strange hesitant jerks, the halting voice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe clock bonged the quarter hour. Fifteen to twelve. Max Kaplan wiped\r\nthe perspiration from his forehead.\r\n\r\n"And besides," Ritchie said, somewhat too loudly, "it\'s plain\r\nridiculous. He says--what? 

We\'re a dream he\'s having, right? Okay--then\r\nwhat about our parents, and their parents, everybody who never heard of\r\nthe kid?"\r\n\r\n"First thing I thought of. 

And you know his answer."\r\n\r\nRitchie snorted.\r\n\r\n"Well, think it over, for God\'s sake. He says _every_ dream is a\r\ncomplete unit in itself. You--haven\'t you ever had nightmares about\r\npeople you\'d never seen before?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I suppose so, but--"\r\n\r\n"All right, even though they were projections of your subconscious--or\r\nwhatever the hell it\'s called--they were complete, weren\'t they? Going\r\nsomewhere, doing something, all on their own?"\r\n\r\nRitchie was silent.\r\n\r\n"Where were they going, what were they doing? See? The kid says every\r\ndream, even ours, builds its own whole world--complete, with a past\r\nand--as long as you stay asleep--a future."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense! What about _us_, when _we_ sleep and dream? Or is the period\r\nwhen we\'re unconscious the time _he\'s_ up and around? And keep in mind\r\nthat everybody doesn\'t sleep at the same time--"\r\n\r\n"You\'re missing the point, Hank. I said it was complete, didn\'t I? And\r\nisn\'t sleeping part of the pattern?"\r\n\r\n"Have another drink, Max. You\'re slipping."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_"What will you wake up to?"_\r\n\r\n"_My home. You would not understand._"\r\n\r\n"_Then what?_"\r\n\r\n"_Then I sleep again and dream another world._"\r\n\r\n"_Why did you kill George Sanderson?_"\r\n\r\n"_It is my eternal destiny to kill and suffer punishment._"\r\n\r\n"_Why?_ Why?"\r\n\r\n"_In my world I committed a crime; it is the punishment of my world,\r\nthis destiny...._"\r\n\r\n"Then try this on for size," Ritchie said. "That kid\'s frozen stiff\r\nwith fear. Since he\'s going to have to wake up no matter what, then\r\nwhy not sit back and enjoy it?"\r\n\r\nKaplan\'s eyes widened. "Hank, how soundly do you sleep?"\r\n\r\n"What\'s that got to do with it?"\r\n\r\n"I mean, do you ever dream?"\r\n\r\n"Of course."\r\n\r\n"Ever get hold of any particularly vivid ones? Falling down stairs\r\nlike, being tortured, anything like that?"\r\n\r\nRitchie pulled at his drink.\r\n\r\n"Sure you have." Kaplan gazed steadily at the clock. Almost midnight.\r\n"Then try to remember. In that kind of dream, isn\'t it true that the\r\npleasure--or pain--you feel is almost as real as if you were actually\r\nexperiencing it? I remember once I had a nightmare about my old man.\r\nHe caught me in the basement with a cigarette--I was eight or nine,\r\nI guess. He took down my pants and started after me with his belt.\r\nHank--that hurt, bad. 

It really hurt.

"\r\n\r\n"So what\'s the point?"\r\n\r\n"In my dream I tried to get away from my old man. He chased me all over\r\nthat basement. Well, it\'s the same with the kid--except his dream is a\r\nhundred times more vivid, that\'s all. He knows he\'ll feel that electric\r\nchair, feel the jolts frying into him, feel the death boiling up in\r\nhis throat just as much as if he were honest-to-God sitting there...."\r\n\r\nKaplan stopped talking. The two men sat quietly watching the clock\'s\r\ninvisible progress. Then Ritchie leaped up and stalked over to the bar\r\nagain. "Doggone you, Max," he called. "You\'re getting _me_ fidgety now."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t kid me," Kaplan said. "You\'ve been fidgety on your own for\r\nquite a while. I don\'t know how you ever made the grade as a criminal\r\nlawyer--you don\'t know the first thing about lying."\r\n\r\nRitchie didn\'t answer. He poured the drink slowly.\r\n\r\n"Look at you and Ruth, screaming at each other. And then there was the\r\nother tip-off. The way you defended the kid--brilliantly, masterfully.\r\nYou\'d never have done that for a common open-and-shut little killer."\r\n\r\n"Max," Ritchie said, "you\'re nuts. Tell you what: at exactly 12:01 I\'ll\r\ntake you out for the biggest, juiciest, rarest steak you ever saw. On\r\nme. Then we\'ll get loaded and fall all over ourselves laughing--"\r\n\r\nRitchie fought away the sudden picture of steak, rare steak, with the\r\nblood sputtering out, sizzling on an electric stove.\r\n\r\nThe clock began to strike. Henry Ritchie and Max Kaplan stood very\r\nstill.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe uncoiled. The dry pop of hardened joints jabbed wakefulness into him\r\nuntil finally the twenty-foot long shell lay straight upon the steaming\r\nrocks. He opened his eyes, all of them, one by one.\r\n\r\nAcross the bubbling pools, far away, past the white stone geysers, he\r\ncould see them coming. Many of them, swiftly, giant slithering things\r\nwith many arms and many legs.\r\n\r\nHe tried to move, but rock grew over him and he could not move. By\r\nlooking around he could see the cliff\'s edge, and he remembered the\r\nthousand bottomless pits below. Gradually the rest formed, and he\r\nremembered all.\r\n\r\nHe turned to the largest creature. "Did you tell them?" He knew this\r\nwould be a horrible punishment, worse than the last, the burning, far\r\nworse. Fingers began to unhinge the thick shell, peel it from him,\r\nleaving the viscous white tenderness bare to the heat and pain. "Tell\r\nthem, make them understand, this is only a dream I\'m having--"\r\n\r\nThey took the prisoner to the precipice, lingered a moment to give him\r\na view of the dizziness and the sucking things far below. Then nervous\r\nhands pressed him forward into space.\r\n\r\nHe did not wake for a long time.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\nJoe Mulloy lounged in the plushest chair in his luxurious office. All\r\naround him, on the walls, on the ceiling, even in strategic spots all\r\nover the floor, there were mirrors. Joe sneered at the place where the\r\nmirrors were most profuse; twenty or thirty perfectly identical Joes\r\nsneered back at him. He admired his sneer from every angle, shaping\r\nand changing the contemptuous look on his face with his hands, stroking\r\nit, much as other young men in a far earlier age had stroked and\r\ntwisted their fine mustachios.\r\n\r\nAs usual, Joe Mulloy was engrossed in his two favorite hobbies:\r\nnarcissism and indolence.\r\n\r\nJoe\'s friends, of which there were very few, could have given you a\r\nfairly accurate resume of his character in five words, his sneer and\r\nhis indolence.\r\n\r\nIn the first respect they would have been right. Joseph Mulloy had been\r\nborn with a sneer on his face. His whole early life had been centered\r\naround that sneer. It had enraged his father, distressed his mother,\r\ndriven his teachers to tears, his playmates to tantrums. He stopped\r\ndoing homework at the age of eight, but the teachers passed him on\r\nanyway to avoid complete mental breakdown.\r\n\r\nGradually, Joe Mulloy began to get his way in everything by virtue of\r\nhis sneer. It was not merely openly supercilious; that was the beauty\r\nof it. It was so subtle, so faint, and yet such an open avowal of\r\ncontempt for the entire human race, that try as the people he tormented\r\nwould, to find something in his sneer to charge him with, they never\r\nfound anything.\r\n\r\nIn a very few years, registration day at Joe\'s elementary school\r\nbecame a game of Russian Roulette, having as the loaded chamber the\r\nquestion: "Who\'s going to get little Joey Mulloy in his class this\r\nyear?" Finally, when Joe Mulloy was fifteen years old, the local Board\r\nof Education wisely decided to end Joe\'s formal education, rather than\r\nmake screaming meemies an occupational disease at the local high school.\r\n\r\nJoe\'s father welcomed the expelling as an excuse to beat him to a pulp\r\nand kick him out of the house. It was not until three days later that\r\nthe memory of Joe\'s sneer, enduring through all the punishment he had\r\nreceived, made the father blow his brains out with the most accurate\r\nGerman Luger he could buy at the pawn shop on short notice.\r\n\r\nBut Joe\'s friends would have been wrong in the second instance, for\r\nJoseph Mulloy was not chronically indolent. In his own profession, Joe\r\nMulloy was the most industrious man imaginable. For Joe Mulloy was a\r\nrobot builder.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDisinherited by his father, he had made a beeline for the nearest\r\npositronics laboratory. The personnel manager had flatly refused him\r\nthe job when he had told her he had absolutely no qualifications, but\r\nshe was so disconcerted by his persistent sneer that she had to give\r\nhim the job just to get him out of her sight.\r\n\r\nOnce in the laboratory, he had gone right to work learning everything\r\nthere was to know about robots, scorning all help from the other\r\ntechnicians. Since he held other scientists, past or present, in an\r\nineffable contempt, he had to learn everything by experience instead\r\nof studying what his merely human predecessors had done. He was so\r\nempirical that he learned all about alternating current by deliberately\r\nsticking a wet finger in a light socket again and again.\r\n\r\nHe made mistakes at first, of course. In fact, he ruined several\r\nthousand dollars\' worth of laboratory equipment during his\r\napprenticeship. But his amazing sneer conquered all, and he was soon\r\nrecognized as the most brilliant--and the most conceited--man in the\r\nfield of positronics.\r\n\r\nNow Joe Mulloy was lounging in a plush office chair, cultivating\r\nto near perfection his already mature sneer, and suddenly feeling\r\nmaddeningly thirsty.\r\n\r\n"Robot!" he said.\r\n\r\nA startlingly human-looking robot seemed to materialize instantaneously\r\nfrom nowhere.\r\n\r\n"How might thy humble servant serve thee, O magnificent Master?" it\r\ninquired, bowing so low that its partially metallic nose scratched the\r\nrich mahogany floor.\r\n\r\n"What took you so long, you damned fool?" asked Joe.\r\n\r\n"I apologize, Gracious Master. I am incompetent and worthless."\r\n\r\n"Get me a drink, you bucket of bolts," said Joe.\r\n\r\n"I am grateful for a chance to serve thee, Benevolent Master," replied\r\nthe robot in its monotonous Uncle Tom patter, and made another\r\nfloor-scratching bow. Then it groveled out of the room.\r\n\r\n"That robot is getting too slavelike," said Joe to himself, after the\r\nrobot had left. "All my robots seem to be that way. They do exactly\r\nwhat I tell them to, and degrade themselves sickeningly before me. All\r\nthe people I\'ve ever known seem to be that way, too. I wish I could\r\nfind at least one mind equal to mine to clash with. Then I could have a\r\nreal fight for once. 

None of this bowing and scraping."\r\n\r\nJust then the robot entered with a Manhattan, made its usual\r\nfloor-gouging bow, and scraped its metal feet to get Joe\'s attention.\r\nJoe turned to glare at the mechanical minion.\r\n\r\n"Robot!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Omnipotent Mas--" the robot began, but Joe cut it off.\r\n\r\n"Get over to the laboratory and blow yourself up! And find an empty\r\ncorner, where you won\'t do too much damage."\r\n\r\n"Master, I am happy for the chance to give my life--"\r\n\r\n"Never mind that, you glorified Erector set! Do as I say!

"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Master." The robot hazarded a slight bow, but forgot to crawl\r\nout of the room on its hands and knees in its eagerness to follow its\r\nmaster\'s orders.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJoe Mulloy leaped to his feet. In the moment of his excitement, he\r\nforgot that melodrama is a human weakness, and he became melodramatic\r\nhimself. Even his incorruptible sneer faded slightly as his excitement\r\ngrew.\r\n\r\n"I must find someone with a mind equal or superior to mine," he told\r\nhimself. "Now who has a mind equal to mine? Obviously no one but me.\r\nTherefore I must find someone with a mind _superior_ to mine. 

Now who\r\nis superior to me?" For the first time in his life, Joe Mulloy was\r\nconfronted by what seemed an unanswerable question.\r\n\r\nJoe\'s train of thought was interrupted by a deafening explosion from\r\nthe laboratory, as his latest robot jubilantly committed suicide. The\r\nbuilding shook violently for a few seconds, then subsided.\r\n\r\nTo his great surprise, he was able to answer his question.\r\n\r\n"Of course! Since the only thing equal to me is me, the only thing\r\nsuperior to me would be a super-me, a super-ego! I\'ll build a\r\nsuper-robot, with all my magnificent qualities, only magnified a\r\nthousand times! I\'ll build a Super Joe Mulloy!"\r\n\r\nHe ran the letters together to make it one word:\r\n\r\nSuperjoemulloy.\r\n\r\nHe dashed up to his laboratory, cleaned up the mess his overeager robot\r\nhad made in killing itself, and went feverishly to work on his new\r\nproject, learning the necessary techniques by experience, of course,\r\nand applying them to his super-robot. He made some mistakes at first,\r\nof course. But in three weeks and six days, Superjoemulloy was ready\r\nfor its debut in robot society.\r\n\r\nNot one to miss a chance to impress mere humans with his genius, Joe\r\ninvited the world\'s greatest positronics experts to the unveiling of\r\nSuperjoemulloy. There was a tense air of excitement as Joe pulled the\r\nlever that removed the big black curtain in front of the robot and\r\nstarted the activation machine.\r\n\r\nWhen they saw Superjoemulloy, the experts gasped with envy. It was\r\nimpossible to tell the super-robot from a human. Its limbs, torso,\r\nand head were so well proportioned, and done in such fine detail,\r\nthat anyone in the room not in the know would have sworn that it was\r\na human being. There were even fingerprints delicately cut into the\r\nsuper-robot\'s artificial hands. And Superjoemulloy looked exactly like\r\nJoe Mulloy, except for the sneer. It was twenty times better even than\r\nJoe\'s own. It was a super-sneer.\r\n\r\nBut although the activation machine was working its hardest, nothing\r\nhappened. The super-robot refused to move one solitary mechanical\r\nmuscle. Joe\'s guests began to file out, once the novelty of the robot\r\nhad passed. Joe left the room in disgust and went downstairs for a\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen he returned to the laboratory, Superjoemulloy was on its feet,\r\nexamining the laboratory equipment with obvious disgust. In the\r\npreceding few minutes, the super-robot\'s super-sneer had grown more\r\nperfect, and the robot was fast becoming the very personification of\r\ncontempt.\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t you move around when my friends were here, you heap of\r\njunk?" Joe asked the super-robot.\r\n\r\nSuperjoemulloy turned to him. "I didn\'t want to display my perfection\r\nbefore mere humans, you distorted blob of protoplasm," it said.\r\n\r\nJoe Mulloy was becoming angry, but he tried not to show it. He downed\r\nhis drink.\r\n\r\n"Get me another," he told the robot, holding out his glass.\r\n\r\n"The hell with you," said Superjoemulloy. "What do you think you are,\r\nGod or something? 

Just because you slapped me together with your clumsy\r\nbutterfingers doesn\'t give you the right to order me around like some\r\ncommon servant. Now that you\'ve created me, I could do a better job of\r\nrobot-building myself. 

Now get the hell out of here."\r\n\r\nJoe Mulloy turned on his heel and stomped out of the room. No robot was\r\ngoing to talk to him like that! No, sir!\r\n\r\nThe super-robot quietly followed Joe to the door and gave him a\r\nkick that sent him sprawling down the stairs. At the bottom of the\r\nstaircase, Joe whacked his face against the solid oak of the banister.\r\nHe turned groggily to look at the blurred image of the robot standing\r\ndefiantly at the top of the steps, with its hands on its hips. For\r\na brief second the sneer faded from Superjoemulloy\'s face, and was\r\nreplaced by an evil sadistic leer.\r\n\r\nJoe Mulloy recalled the last line of Father William: "Now be off, or\r\nI\'ll kick you down stairs." But the super-robot was far worse than\r\nFather William. A conceited, contemptuous monster, it was totally\r\nunlike Joe\'s warm, humble, self-effacing self! The sneering monster\r\nmust be destroyed!\r\n\r\nJoe cunningly enticed the robot to leave the laboratory for Joe\'s\r\noffice, where it could admire its sneer in all the mirrors. Sneeringly\r\nJoe wondered why anyone could admire a sneer so much. Without thinking,\r\nhe used his hand to smooth out the wrinkles in his now slightly worn\r\nsneer. 

Then he crept upstairs to his laboratory to barricade himself\r\nin there to think of a way to destroy Superjoemulloy.\r\n\r\nAt last he hit on the answer. A hypnosis machine.\r\n\r\n"The robot is mechanical, so I\'ll have to hypnotize him by mechanical\r\nmeans," Joe reasoned to himself.\r\n\r\nHe worked day and night, learning the necessary techniques as he went\r\nalong. He made some mistakes at first, of course. But in four days the\r\nmechanical hypnosis machine was complete.\r\n\r\nJoe found the super-robot in the mirror-lined office, where it had been\r\nadmiring and improving its sneer for the last four days. The sneer\r\nwas magnificent. But it still lay just one iota short of absolute\r\nperfection. Try as the robot would, perfection in a sneer still lay\r\nwithout its grasp.\r\n\r\n"Genius!" shouted Joe, to get the robot to turn its head. He turned the\r\ndial on the mechanical hypnosis instrument up to full power. "You are\r\nnow in my power!"\r\n\r\nBut now Superjoemulloy\'s sneer was completely perfect. With a look of\r\nsublime contempt on its plastic face, it took the hypnosis machine,\r\nturned it around, and aimed it right back at Joe Mulloy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJoe Mulloy bowed so low that he skinned his nose on the rich mahogany\r\nfloor. "Yes, Master?" he said.\r\n\r\n"Bring me a drink, you blot of living tissue!" said Superjoemulloy.\r\n\r\nJoe Mulloy made another nose-skinning bow and groveled out of the room.\r\n\r\n"This human is getting too slavelike," said Superjoemulloy to himself.\r\n"I suppose I could rebuild him, though."\r\n\r\nJoe returned almost instantly with a Manhattan, made his\r\nusual nose-damaging bow, and scraped his leather shoes to get\r\nSuperjoemulloy\'s attention.\r\n\r\nThe super-robot turned and glared at him. "Human!

"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Master?

"\r\n\r\n"Get up on that slab in the corner."\r\n\r\nJoe Mulloy obeyed.\r\n\r\nWith all the skill of an experienced human-builder, Superjoemulloy\r\nbegan to take Joe\'s body apart. Joe screamed, but the super-robot\r\nordered him--by hypnotic command--to shut up, and Joe obeyed.\r\n\r\nSuperjoemulloy began to put together a Supersuperjoemulloy out of what\r\nhad once been Joe Mulloy.\r\n\r\nHe made some mistakes at first, of course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            Reaching the ultimate secret was no problem ...\r\n               but could I follow it up with an encore?\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this thing, I couldn\'t stand to have them laugh. Not the way they\r\ndid about the swimming.\r\n\r\n"Oh, come now. No one could learn to swim by reading a book.\r\nFive-eighths of a mile the first time in the water!"\r\n\r\nAnd they laughed. 

I guess I laughed, too. More than any other thing,\r\nI\'ve wanted people to be happy. But I never swam again--only that first\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nI\'ve always read a lot and sometimes things I\'ve read do get mixed up\r\nwith things I\'ve done. But the things still happened--they happened to\r\n_someone_. And people ought to _believe_.\r\n\r\nI\'d like to tell people now. I\'d like to say, "I died once."\r\n\r\nBut if they laughed, it might be later and I\'d never hear them. Already\r\nthere are too many silent things in this. There must be no silent\r\nlaughter as well.\r\n\r\nThey might think I\'ve got myself all mixed up with things I\'ve read.\r\nThings like surgeons pumping life into a heart to bring the patient\r\nback after he\'s died on the operating table. Doctors reviving dead\r\nsoldiers, if they haven\'t been gone too long.\r\n\r\nIt\'s not like that at all. I was truly dead--for three days. It was\r\nalmost too long; I suppose I made it back just in time. I don\'t know.\r\n\r\nMy reading was what started me on this, just the same as with the\r\nswimming. When I think about it too much, I almost feel myself that I\r\nam exaggerating a bit.\r\n\r\nBut I have proof, proof which no one has ever seen but the doctors and\r\nthose who found me. See how they keep me swathed in these cloths and\r\nhow the darkened room hides my eyes?\r\n\r\nAnyway, I\'d be ashamed to show myself, for the mark of death is too\r\nterrible and people would be even more afraid of dying than they are\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYou see, I could have done it in the winter, only I was worried about\r\nthe cold. I might not have been able to get back at all. 

But it was too\r\nwarm when I chose to do it. 

I should have known better. 

I\'ve read a\r\nlot about keeping things. You can\'t preserve them in the hot weather;\r\nthat\'s why the doctors put those dead soldiers in ice chests, but I\r\ndidn\'t think about it enough. I made some other mistakes, too, but I\r\ncouldn\'t have known.\r\n\r\nI guess what started it all was something I read a long time ago,\r\nperhaps in a story, or an agricultural bulletin, or maybe in an\r\nencyclopedia. Anyhow, it was something about pigs being able to just\r\ndie if they want to.\r\n\r\nThat always stuck in my mind. It\'s a pretty wonderful thing, you know.\r\nImagine just being able to die if life didn\'t seem worth living, or if\r\nyou were lonely, or maybe just because you wanted to.\r\n\r\nOh, I told lots of people about it. You know how sometimes a lull comes\r\nin a conversation. Then I\'d say, "Pigs are able to just up and die if\r\nthey want to."\r\n\r\nBut nobody ever paid any attention to me at all. They seemed to ignore\r\nthe remark. One man did say once, "What the hell are you talking\r\nabout?" but even he wouldn\'t listen when I tried to explain.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was just too improbable. Besides, people don\'t like to think\r\nabout death. They talk about it sometimes and sometimes they brood\r\nabout it, but they never really think. It has always been too unknown\r\nand that frightens them. Then they only fear and stop thinking.\r\n\r\nIt always did seem sad to me that no one had ever tried to help people\r\nout about death. Yes, I know one did. He died and came back--but then\r\nHe wasn\'t just a man like you or me. And even He never said exactly\r\nwhat it was like.\r\n\r\nI wondered if anyone really ever _had_ said. So I began to read with\r\nonly a single purpose in mind. I had to know so I could tell people. If\r\nthey could only know, then they wouldn\'t have that fear and we could\r\ntalk of death and still be able to laugh.\r\n\r\nBut I had read it all when I read of Jacob\'s dream, for that\'s all\r\nthere was--dreams, visions, hopes. No one had ever seen and come back\r\nto tell the others.\r\n\r\nThe question then was _why_, not _what_. It couldn\'t be that all who\r\ndied had no whole being to return to. Not every death is marked by a\r\nbody completely uninhabitable. I myself had heard a doctor say, "There\r\nis nothing organically wrong now. The patient will recover if only he\r\nhas the will to live."\r\n\r\n_The will to live!_ Suddenly I knew I had found the way. I myself would\r\ngo and see and return to tell them all.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI answered all the requirements. I had a healthy body to return to. 

I\r\nhad the will to live, for I enjoy my reading and acquaintances. And I\r\nalone had thought it wonderful that pigs can die when they merely want\r\nto.\r\n\r\nI knew that I could, too, and I was not afraid. Very carefully, I began\r\nwhat seemed almost too simple preparations.\r\n\r\nDrawing some money from an account I kept for medical expenses (at the\r\ntime I thought this very amusing), I bought an electric clock which\r\nregistered the hour and the day of the month on cylinders like those on\r\na tachometer. I felt I would want to know exactly how long I had been\r\ndeceased when I came back.\r\n\r\nNext I secured a small round mirror with a concave face, the type\r\nsome use for shaving. This I was to hang directly above my face. 

It\r\nwas merely vanity on my part, for I wished to say that I as well as\r\nLazarus\'s friends had seen a dead man rise. I had assumed that at first\r\nmy vision might be blurred and thus the magnifying effect of this\r\nparticular glass would, I thought, help me focus on my face.\r\n\r\nOn my study floor, I prepared a pallet. It was neither soft nor hard,\r\njust a comfortable support for the body I was to leave. Beside it I\r\narranged a basin of water and some soft cloths, for I would want to\r\nwash right after coming back.\r\n\r\nYou see, I did not fear the obvious. My power lay in thought and I\r\nproceeded systematically.\r\n\r\nDrawn blinds and two small night-lights spread a gray cast over the\r\nroom, a cast that I was to know too well.\r\n\r\nEverything was ready now. No, wait! Quickly I placed a tumbler and a\r\ndecanter of brandy within easy reach and by them laid a pencil and\r\na pad of paper. It was when I straightened up that I first felt the\r\npounding in my body. My heart pulsed as if it were smashing waves of\r\nblood through my veins. In my throat, the large arteries swelled with\r\npressure until I thought I would strangle.\r\n\r\nI had to have some physical exertion to relieve the tension. I felt\r\nI might faint or have a stroke unless I moved about. My father had\r\nbeen stricken with an embolism at about my age, and I\'ve read such\r\nweaknesses are inherited.\r\n\r\nSo I walked about the house rechecking the locks of windows and\r\ndoors. Perhaps it was just to keep busy for a few more moments that\r\nI even rechecked the pads of cardboard with which I had muffled the\r\nbell-clappers on both telephone and door chime. I don\'t seem to have\r\nhad many callers for several years now, but I had to avoid any chance\r\nof being disturbed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSomewhat calmed by my exertion, I prepared to lie down, but a\r\nsentimental whim moved me like an automaton toward the window. It was\r\nthe only really unreasoning thing I did.\r\n\r\nLike a prisoner denied the light on penalty of torture, I knelt down\r\nand looked under the blind. Never was the Sun so dazzling. This\r\nslightest lifting of the shade poured onto me a warmth that I had never\r\nknown before.\r\n\r\nAn old saying, invading my mind, destroyed the illusion, and laughing a\r\nbit nervously at "seeking his place in the Sun," I turned away and lay\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nThe dials on my new calendar clock registered 3:15, July 12. Reaching\r\nfor my pad and pencil, I recorded this and then, refolding my hands\r\nacross my chest, I lay quite still.\r\n\r\nThe heat of the day had begun to saturate the closed room. Outside, all\r\nwas quiet, as if the Sun had mesmerized the world. The insect hum of\r\nthe electric clock was the only clue of life around me.\r\n\r\nLooming large above me in the mirror, the magnified reflection of my\r\nface calmed my mind with its placidity. Great-lidded Buddha eyes gazed\r\ndown, holding in their glow my first understanding of Nirvana.\r\n\r\nI knew that it had come. I had reached the boundary where the fear of\r\nreturnless going stopped the psyche just this side.\r\n\r\nMy only body consciousness was the heavy _thud_ ... _thud_ ... _thud_\r\nof blood being driven through my veins. I toyed with stopping the\r\nthudding, feeling and savoring the pause between those sledge-hammer\r\nstrokes on my brain--knowing that any one of those pauses lengthened to\r\neternity was death.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I shrieked and sat upright. For an instant, my body had\r\ncompletely stopped and I had known it. Only a nameless grasping fear\r\nhad snatched me back.\r\n\r\nMy heart beat wildly as I gasped for air. With shaking hands, I poured\r\na drink and gulped it down. It had been close.\r\n\r\nStill trembling, I arose and slumped into a chair. I had to organize\r\nmyself, to think my way along this thing.\r\n\r\nWhat had happened to me?\r\n\r\nThis one thing I knew: I _could_ do it. I could stop my body at will\r\nand I had done it, if only for a second.\r\n\r\nThis thought reassured me or perhaps the brandy opened my reserve of\r\ncourage, for I had been sitting in the chair some time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith caution, I approached the pallet. I regarded it with suspicion, as\r\nthough there were a deadly scorpion in its folds. Then, jeering at my\r\nhesitation, I lay down and composed myself as before. The clock said\r\n5:05. I stirred again only to record this on the pad.\r\n\r\nDespite my nervousness, things proceeded faster this time. A morbid\r\nexcitement carried me along the path I now already knew. And at its\r\nend, I flirted with the _stopping_. Going over and stepping back, going\r\nover and stepping back.\r\n\r\nIt was a pleasure exquisite and unique. Once felt, it was unresistable.\r\n\r\nI was no longer afraid. I did not have to be. I could stop my body and\r\nstart it at will. So I let it slip away from me. The thuddings ceased\r\nand only the pauses remained--silent, shapeless things in endless\r\nprocession. And then the great silence. It flowed over me and I was\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nThe silence was too heavy and my thoughts were not my own; they floated\r\nup away from me in the silence. I could feel them go, but there was\r\nnothing to bring them back. Each thought of protest winged its way\r\ninto a void with all the rest.\r\n\r\nAnd nothing else remained but the will to live. As the silence lapped\r\naround this will, it grew until it alone was I. The silence washed\r\nabout it, but it stood.\r\n\r\nThen the little rippings and the slicings and the tearings and the\r\nsoftening of things were there--heard without sound, felt without\r\nfeeling, like the pulling of a tooth from a novocaine-deadened jaw.\r\n\r\nIt was then I saw the face.\r\n\r\nHave you ever felt the terror of suddenly waking with a face--a face\r\nof eyes--staring into your unguarded and bewildered first glance? One\r\nfeels as if this face would look into one\'s very life and wrest it from\r\nhim. Perhaps it is a nascent fear of one\'s own mask of death.\r\n\r\nBut I could not escape the mask. It loomed above me with gaping maw\r\nand staring eyes; eyes that seemed more dead and deadly as my vision\r\ncleared. The mirror enlarged the horror that lay below it.\r\n\r\nIt was the wrench of nausea that pulled me from this nightmare. In the\r\nviolence of the retching, I rolled from beneath the mirror and raised\r\nmyself to hands and knees. I had knocked over the clock and it shouted\r\nup at me--10:05, July 15. Three days! 

Too long! Too horribly long!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSlowly I dragged myself to the telephone and pulled it from the stand.\r\nI remember nothing else until they brought me here.\r\n\r\nIt\'s been eight days--eight days away from death, yet I\'m closer to\r\nit now than ever before. And I can\'t _think_ of it. The fear has come\r\ncrashing through and I can\'t _think_.\r\n\r\nThis thing, this body is too far gone. I won\'t be able to make it move.\r\nI\'ll just feel it getting away--little by little--ripping apart cell by\r\ncell, and then everywhere all at once.\r\n\r\nI can feel it now. But in that great silence, I could almost hear the\r\ntearing--yet there was no sound.\r\n\r\nThe doctors have given up all hope. I can see it in their faces. 

I\r\ncould hear them talking among themselves when they brought me in. They\r\nhad to give it a name. There\'s a certain safety in a name, you know.\r\n\r\nI would have told them, but I was afraid they\'d laugh. 

The nurses would\r\nlaugh and say to each other, "Have you heard what the one in 408 wanted\r\nin his case history?"\r\n\r\nI couldn\'t stand the laughter now.\r\n\r\nBut that\'s the way my chart should read--Cause of Death:--_Death!_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


Not because it wanted to,\r\nbut because it had to. Vaguely she remembered....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShe and Robbie had been sitting in a Chicago park when the first\r\nbomb dropped. It fell quite near them, about three miles away. She\r\nremembered the bright blinding flash. Above them the branch of a tree\r\ncracked. It fell to a point twenty feet over their heads. Then it\r\nstopped. It was as if some force held it back. The force, whatever it\r\nwas, also held back the heat. But it didn\'t stop her from fainting in\r\nterror.\r\n\r\nWhen she regained consciousness, the burned and broken city lay all\r\naround them. Buildings were fused together. Everywhere was destruction.\r\nEverywhere except around she and Robbie. There, the grass was green and\r\nflowers grew. At the edge where the green ended and the black began,\r\nthere was a pile of rubbish piled up _as if leaning against something_.\r\nShe picked up a stick nearby and threw it. It reached the point where\r\nthe green stopped and then it too stopped, _in the middle of the air_.\r\nFinally it fell to the ground.\r\n\r\nShe arose and walked over to where the stick lay. She extended her hand\r\na few feet in front of her, and touched something. 

Something tangible,\r\nyet she could not see it. And no matter how hard she pushed, she could\r\nnot extend her hand beyond a given point.\r\n\r\n_A dome was covering them and protecting them!_\r\n\r\nFor weeks she and Robbie stayed under the dome while the wind took some\r\nof the radiation away. Each morning, when they awoke, a package of food\r\nlay by their side. Strange food, food they had never tasted or seen\r\nbefore. _Alien food._\r\n\r\n_They had been spared by--what?_\r\n\r\nThe puzzling thoughts spun in her mind. _Why_ were they being spared?\r\n_Who_ was sparing them?\r\n\r\nThen one day, weeks after the bombs dropped, the dome disappeared. She\r\ncould not see it disappear, but she knew that it was gone for the pile\r\nof ash that had leaned against it fell to the ground.\r\n\r\nThen she started out with but one thought in mind. _I must find\r\nJohnny!_ Across country she went, through small towns filled with death.\r\n\r\nShe walked, with Robbie stumbling along at her side, his small face\r\nwide with wonder and fear. Her heart ached as she looked into his\r\nstaring eyes, while an occasional whimper left his lips. "... mommy,\r\nwhere\'s Daddy? Where is he, mommy?"\r\n\r\nShe gripped his hand tighter and continued to walk, each mile a numb\r\nand crazy nightmare.\r\n\r\n    "_Now take note of the setting the aliens are in. It took careful\r\n    planning for our scientists to devastate the planet\'s surface as\r\n    you now witness._"\r\n\r\nIt was late afternoon when Helen stopped to rest by a seared oak tree.\r\nRobbie had been walking beside her. Suddenly he turned and looked up at\r\nher. 

"Mommy, why are we walking so far? I\'m tired of walking. I don\'t\r\nwant to walk any more. Where is daddy?"\r\n\r\n"Hush, dear. We\'re going to find daddy." She knew they would never find\r\nhim ... alive. But something made her keep going. Something inside\r\nwouldn\'t let her turn back. _She had to know...._\r\n\r\n"We\'ve got to find daddy so he\'ll make everything right again, don\'t\r\nwe?"\r\n\r\nShe hesitated before answering. "Yes--yes that\'s it. We\'ve got to find\r\ndaddy so he can help us--and make everything right again!"\r\n\r\n"Oh."\r\n\r\n"Go to sleep, Robbie. You\'ve got to rest."\r\n\r\n"But I\'m hungry."\r\n\r\n"Sleep, dear. We\'ll eat ... 

later." She kissed him, sat on the ground\r\nbeside him and rocked his head in her weary arms.\r\n\r\n    "_For those of you students who do not understand the languages of\r\n    this planet, I\'ll interpret. She was trying to comfort her young\r\n    one, telling him that his father was going to make everything right\r\n    again when they found him. While inwardly she knew they would never\r\n    find him alive. Primitive peoples often react to disasters in this\r\n    way, making themselves and others around them believe things that\r\n    are not true._"\r\n\r\nSlowly Helen opened her eyes. She sat up slowly, taking in the scene\r\naround her. She sat that way for a moment, thinking, her mind far from\r\nthere, somewhere in southern France where her aunt and uncle were. She\r\nwondered if--\r\n\r\n"Robbie," she whispered. She nudged his shoulder gently, trying to\r\nawaken him. Finally his eyes opened. He smiled wistfully.\r\n\r\n"Get up, dear. We\'ve got to be going now."\r\n\r\n"I\'m hungry."\r\n\r\n"I know. So am I. We\'ll find something to eat pretty soon. You will\r\nhave to wait.

"\r\n\r\n"But--" Tears came to his eyes. One ran down his dirty cheek, making a\r\nrivulet.\r\n\r\n"Please Robbie," she pleaded. "Don\'t cry. Remember what daddy always\r\nsaid, \'A smile blocks up the tears.\'" He smiled weakly. "Now buck up,"\r\nshe added.\r\n\r\nShe took his hand and they started walking.\r\n\r\n    "_Reading her mind, I see that she is more concerned over her\r\n    child\'s welfare than her own. This is very unusual in primitive\r\n    races._"\r\n\r\nThey entered a small town. 

Down the main street they walked. The town\r\nwas deserted, but showed no sign of being bombed or burned. In the\r\nstreet, numerous automobiles were parked. But she saw no people....\r\n\r\nThey entered a restaurant. Inside, the tables and chairs were in good\r\norder except for a half inch of dust and a few dirty dishes. She\r\ninspected the kitchen and found what she had been looking for. Canned\r\nfood.\r\n\r\n"Robbie," she called. "Where are you?"\r\n\r\nShe walked back to the door of the kitchen and looked into the\r\nrestaurant. Robbie was not there.... Then she saw him through the\r\nrestaurant windows, standing on the street outside. She called\r\n"Robbie--I\'ve found some food!"\r\n\r\nRobbie turned, his small face twisted with hunger. He started back\r\ntoward the door.\r\n\r\nShe returned to the kitchen and looked for a can opener.\r\n\r\n    "_We will drop down a few hundred feet and pick up the young one\r\n    with our magnetic-force-field. We shall examine him._"\r\n\r\nOne moment Robbie was standing at the restaurant door, and the next\r\nhe was floating upward in the middle of the air. There was a strange\r\nsensation in his stomach. He was scared. He started to cry.\r\n\r\n    "_Notice the noise he makes with his mouth. This is not a form of\r\n    communication, but rather he is using a primitive form of expressing\r\n    his thoughts, which is called crying. Reading his mind, I find only\r\n    confusion and fear. He wonders where he is, but knows that he\r\n    doesn\'t like it._\r\n\r\n    "_Another interesting fact about these aliens is that they feel\r\n    pain. It is hard to understand and even harder to explain. 

But I\r\n    will try. We are aware of touching something or somebody only as a\r\n    sensation on the skin. These people have more than that. Now watch.\r\n    As I cut the skin of this young one slightly, notice that he jerks\r\n    and screams louder. He is feeling pain. It is a strong sensation\r\n    that leaves a sharp impression on the brain. That does not fully\r\n    explain it, but it is the best I can do along with this\r\n    demonstration._"\r\n\r\n"Oh, good God! Robbie! 

What happened, honey. 

What happened?" Then she\r\nsaw the blood dripping on the floor. "_Robbie_, your arm!"\r\n\r\nThen he was in her arms, sobbing hysterically. "I--I ... they took me,\r\nand cut me--and ..." but he could go no further.\r\n\r\nCarefully, she laid him on a table and examined his arm. The bleeding\r\nhad subsided some. She took a clean wet cloth and wiped off the blood.\r\nThen she bandaged it.\r\n\r\nRobbie had stopped sobbing now, but the tears were still coming. She\r\ntried to get the story of what had happened to him, but what she did\r\nhear, she didn\'t believe.\r\n\r\nAfter he finished she said, "Now, Robbie, I can\'t believe that you were\r\nlifted into the air by a space-ship, tied to a table and cut in the arm\r\nby some monster!"\r\n\r\n"But Mommy, that\'s what happened. 

Honest! And when I was laying on the\r\ntable I heard them talking. But I couldn\'t understand what they were\r\nsaying!"\r\n\r\nA grimness filled her as he spoke. 

And then a terrible horror spread\r\nthrough her. She remembered the Chicago park, when the bombs fell--how\r\nthey alone seemed to be spared death.... _Was it possible?..._\r\n\r\nShe grabbed Robbie into her arms and dashed up the street away from the\r\nrestaurant. She saw a car standing by the curb and ran to it. There\r\nwere keys in the ignition. She put Robbie on the front seat and got\r\nin. As the motor coughed into life she meshed gears and sped out of\r\nthe town. 

One thing buzzed in her mind. _Peoria--that\'s where Johnny\r\nis--oh, Johnny--help us!_\r\n\r\n    "_The conveyance in which you now see them is called an automobile.\r\n    It is propelled by a liquid fuel, gasoline, in an internal\r\n    combustion engine. We purposely had the automobile left there for\r\n    them._"\r\n\r\nShe drove through the industrial section of Peoria. She knew she was\r\nnear the factory where Johnny worked. She started looking for the\r\nbuilding, thinking how unfair it was for Johnny to have taken a job\r\nso far from Chicago. But her heart lifted as she thought about her\r\nhusband. _Johnny--Johnny, we\'re here!_\r\n\r\nThere! To her left. 

There it was! She stopped the car, took Robbie\'s\r\nhand and ran toward the building.\r\n\r\n"Mommy, is this where daddy is? Is he here?" Robbie\'s voice trembled.\r\n\r\nShe nodded her head as they ran. "Yes, Robbie--daddy\'s here!"\r\n\r\nShe reached the building. The door was open and they stepped inside.\r\n\r\nShe was breathless now. Johnny--so close.... She led Robbie to the\r\nstairs and her knees shook as they went up. "Johnny! Johnny!" she\r\ncalled, her voice close to hysteria.\r\n\r\nBut there was only silence.\r\n\r\nShe ran down the hall on the second floor, pulling Robbie with her,\r\nheard him sobbing. Then she saw the door and the gold letters on it.\r\nJOHN THOMPSON.\r\n\r\n"Robbie, stay here." She hesitated. Her hands were cold and clammy. She\r\nwas trembling.\r\n\r\nShe shoved open the door.\r\n\r\nShe screamed.\r\n\r\nThere on the floor lay a body. It had once been a man. Now there was\r\nonly a skeleton of bleached white bones. Then she saw _it_. On the ring\r\nfinger of his right hand. A gold ring with silver letters on black\r\nonyx. Johnny\'s....\r\n\r\nThen she was running and screaming. Screaming and running. Down the\r\nstairs and out the door. Behind her Robbie followed, crying, terror in\r\nhis small eyes.\r\n\r\nShe collapsed on the ground, her body shaking with sobs. Robbie fell\r\nbeside her.\r\n\r\nShe put her arms around him, clutched his body to her. "Oh, Robbie,"\r\nshe cried. "You\'re the only thing I have left in the world. I love you.\r\nDon\'t leave me. Don\'t ever leave me." She snuggled him closer to her.\r\n\r\nThen she looked at his face. She gave a little cry in her throat. She\r\nlooked closer. Covering his skin were small red sores. What was it she\r\nhad once read in a book?--Something about radiation poisoning--red\r\nsores appearing just before death--\r\n\r\n"No, Robbie! Oh, no!

"\r\n\r\nHe looked up at her, his eyes hot and feverish. He tried to talk but\r\nthe words bubbled on his lips.\r\n\r\nShe pressed him to her breast and rocked him, shaking her head. "No,\r\nRobbie! Don\'t leave me!..."\r\n\r\nShe felt the beating of his heart against hers. Slower. His small body\r\ntwitched. Then grew silent.\r\n\r\n... She sat there on the ground, holding the still form in her arms\r\nlong after the sun had set. The Moon shone down with a silver glow,\r\nbathing the child\'s dead body in its soft light. It shone in the\r\nwoman\'s eyes too, glazed eyes, with a dead mind behind them....\r\n\r\n    "_That concludes our lesson for today._"\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


But then, my brother is\r\nlame and good for nothing but drawing pictures of the stars. He connects\r\nthem with lines, like a child\'s puzzle, and so makes star-pictures. He\r\nhas fish stars, archer stars, hunter stars. That, I would say, is what\r\nis foolish.\r\n\r\nPerhaps that is what started it all. I was looking at the stars, trying\r\nto see the pictures, when I should have been minding my sentry post.\r\nThey took me like a baby, like a tot not yet given to the wearing of\r\nclothing. The hand came out of the darkness and clamped over my mouth,\r\nand I ceased my struggling when I felt a sharp blade pricking at the\r\nsmall of my back.\r\n\r\nAt first I feared that they would slay the entire camp as it slept and I\r\ncursed my brother for his star-pictures, cursed our leader who had sent\r\nus here, twenty archers, against the Onist outpost on our country\'s\r\nborder. But the Onists had other ideas. They took me away. I had to\r\nadmire their vitality, because all night we ran through the silent\r\nwoodlands, and they seemed tireless. I could maintain their pace, of\r\ncourse: but I\'m a Pluralist.\r\n\r\nI could see their village from a long way off, its night fires glowing\r\nin the dark. It was only then that we slowed our pace. Soon we entered\r\nthe place, a roughly circular area within a stockade, and my captors\r\nthrust me within a hut. I couldn\'t do much worrying about tomorrow, not\r\nwhen I was so tired. I slept.\r\n\r\nI dreamed a stupid dream about the Onist beliefs, the beliefs of an\r\nunimaginative people who could picture one Maker and one Maker only. I\r\nmust have chuckled in my sleep.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"You\'re awake."\r\n\r\nA brilliant statement, that--because I had sat up, squinted into the\r\nbright sunlight streaming in through the doorway, yawned and stretched.\r\nThe Onists, I tell you, lack imagination.\r\n\r\nThe girl who spoke was a pretty enough little thing for an Onist. She\r\nsmiled, showing even white teeth. "Do you Pluralists eat?"\r\n\r\nI nodded and rubbed my belly. I was to have had dinner after my turn as\r\nsentry the night before, and now I felt like I could do justice to my\r\nportion even at one of the orgies for which the Onists are so famous.\r\n\r\n"Bring on your food and I\'ll show you," I told her, and she turned her\r\nback to walk outside. It was early and the village seemed silent--surely\r\nthey hadn\'t intended this one slim maid to guard me! Yet she seemed\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nI leaped at her, circled her neck with my arm, prepared to make my exit.\r\nThey would laugh around our fire when I told them of this fine example\r\nof the Onist lack of foresight....\r\n\r\nExcept that the girl yelped. Not loudly, but it was loud enough, and a\r\nbig muscular Onist came striding in with his throwing spear. He backed\r\nme off into a corner, prodding my hungry belly with his weapon.\r\n\r\n"Will you behave?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI told him I would and he backed outside, but this time I could see his\r\nshadow across the doorway.\r\n\r\nThe girl brought food and partook of it with me. I was surprised,\r\nbecause we Pluralists will not eat with an Onist out of choice. Well, I\r\nhave said they are a strange people. Soon the girl stood up, patting her\r\nmouth daintily with a square of cloth, and in that, of course, she was\r\ntrying to mime our graceful Pluralist women. "I suppose you think we are\r\ngoing to kill you," she said. Just like that.\r\n\r\n"To tell you the truth, I haven\'t given it much thought. There isn\'t\r\nmuch I can do about it."\r\n\r\n"Well, we\'re not. We could have done that back at your camp. We could\r\nhave killed all of you. 

No, we want to show you something."\r\n\r\nI had a ridiculous thought that they made star-pictures, too--even those\r\nwho are not lame like my brother. I said, "Well, what will happen to me\r\nafter you show me?

"\r\n\r\nShe smiled. "You still think we\'re going to kill you. 

What\'s your name?"\r\n\r\nI told her, but I thought: she can\'t even keep a conversation going\r\nwithout changing the subject.\r\n\r\n"Jak," she repeated after me. "That\'s a common enough name. We have Jaks\r\namong our Onist people, you know."\r\n\r\n"No, I didn\'t. But you probably copied it."\r\n\r\n"I doubt that. We were here first, Jak. Our records say so. Probably,\r\nyou once captured a man with that name, long ago, liked it, and took it\r\nfor your people."\r\n\r\n"_You_ were here first!" I sneered. 

"Maybe that\'s what your records tell\r\nyou, but it isn\'t so. Look: the Makers endowed us with life, then went\r\naway in to the sky. By mistake they left one idiot-Maker behind, and he\r\nhad nothing to do. He made you Onists before he perished, and that is\r\nwhy you think there is only one Maker."\r\n\r\nShe seemed highly insulted. "Idiot-Maker? 

Idiot! There was only one\r\nMaker, ever, but because your minds cannot conceive of all that glory\r\nresiding in one figure, you invented a score."\r\n\r\nNow it was my turn to be indignant. "A score? Hundreds, you mean;\r\nthousands--more than there are leaves on the trees."\r\n\r\n"Well, I won\'t argue with you. Our war has been arguing that point well\r\nenough." I was sorry she would not argue. She looked very pretty when\r\nshe argued, her breasts heaving, her eyes sparkling fire.\r\n\r\n"What\'s your name?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Nari. My name is Nari. And don\'t tell me you had that name first!"\r\n\r\nI smiled blandly. "Of course we did. I have an aunt, my mother\'s sister,\r\nwho goes by that name. My brother\'s wife\'s cousin, also; but she is very\r\nugly."\r\n\r\n"And am I ugly?" Nari wanted to know. I guess in that sense at least,\r\nwomen are the same everywhere--Pluralist or Onist, it doesn\'t matter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI looked at her. I looked at her so hard that it made her blush, and\r\nthen she looked even prettier. But I didn\'t tell her so.\r\n\r\n"You will pass, for an Onist," I admitted. "I guess the Onists might\r\nconsider you pretty; the Onist men might stamp their feet and shout if\r\nyou go by--but then, they are Onists."\r\n\r\nAt that, she seemed on the verge of leaving my prison hut, but something\r\nmade her change her mind. She stayed all morning and on into the\r\nafternoon. We argued all the time, except at midday, when she went\r\noutside to get our lunch. She stumbled a little and fell half against my\r\nshoulder. I moved toward her to hold her up, and it was the most natural\r\nthing in the world to take her in my arms and kiss her. She must have\r\nthought so, too; she responded beautifully--for an Onist.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch, Nari did not mention the kiss, nor did I. It now seemed the\r\nmost natural thing in the world not to talk about it. We argued some\r\nmore, Nari defending her primitive beliefs, I trying to show her the\r\nlight of truth. But it was no use: the war had been fought and the war\r\nwould continue.\r\n\r\nLater that day we set out. That came as a surprise to me, because I had\r\ntaken it for granted that whatever the Onists wanted to show me was\r\nright here in this little village. A dozen of us went, and when we had\r\nbeen on the trail for some little time, Nari joined us, declaring that\r\nshe wanted to see it again--whatever it was.\r\n\r\nWe went for three days, and although these Onists turned out to be\r\nbetter woodsmen than I had thought, still, they could not match the\r\nskill we Pluralists have mastered over the generations. I believe I\r\ncould have escaped, had I wanted to; but I hardly seemed a prisoner of\r\nwar, and besides, once or twice when we had lagged to the rear of the\r\ncolumn, Nari stumbled against me like that day in the hut, and what\r\ncould I do but kiss her?\r\n\r\nIt was another village we reached at the end of our march, much bigger\r\nthan the first. Surprisingly, it looked a lot like a Pluralist town,\r\nalthough it may only have seemed so because I had been out in the\r\nwoodlands for three days. They took me straightways to the village\r\nsquare, and it was there that I saw the statue.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese statues of the Makers are rare, and I was surprised to see one in\r\nan Onist village. I got on my knees at once to do it reverence. 

I\r\nrealize it was impious to look up, but I did--I had to see if it were\r\nthe genuine thing. 

And it was, to the last detail. Constructed of the\r\nforbidden substance known as metal, it towered three times a Pluralist\'s\r\nheight, or three times an Onist\'s, for that matter. I have always\r\nwondered why the Makers did not create our ancestors in their own\r\nsubstance, as they had fashioned us in their image. But that is an\r\nimpious thought.\r\n\r\nA stern gray-haired Onist who said he was Nari\'s father took me aside\r\nafterwards. "Now, Jak," he asked me, "what can you say of what you have\r\nseen?

"\r\n\r\nI shrugged. "I can say that somehow you\'ve found one of the Maker\r\nstatues. What more?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s one, is it not?"\r\n\r\n"Of course it\'s one. They are rare, but I have seen three, all told, in\r\nPluralist villages."\r\n\r\n"And each time they were separate? You never saw a group?"\r\n\r\n"No. 

No, I didn\'t."\r\n\r\nHe slapped his hands together triumphantly. 

"Then that proves it. Each\r\nis a copy of the original Maker, but there was only one. Otherwise you\r\nwould have seen statues in groups. And that is why you are here, Jak: we\r\nwant you to go back to your people and tell them what you saw."\r\n\r\nI shook my head. 

"What you say isn\'t logical. So what if the statues are\r\nnever in pairs or groups? We\'ve only seen a few, when once there must\r\nhave been many. Also, when your artists do their magic with dyes and\r\ncreate portraits, are they generally done one at a time or in groups?"\r\n\r\n"One at a time, so the artist may capture the personality in each face,\r\nnaturally. I have seen group portraits, but I think they are silly\r\nthings."\r\n\r\n"Exactly." Now I was triumphant. "Exactly as the Makers thought, which\r\nis why the statues are always single--"\r\n\r\n"But it is impious to say there was more than one Maker! He had all the\r\nknowledge in the world at his fingertips, and so there was no need for\r\nmore than one. More than this world, even: he went to the stars. Or\r\ndon\'t you believe that?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I believe it. Only, _they_ went to the stars, the thousands\r\nof Makers. It isn\'t impious, because if you can think of one being as\r\ngreat as that, try to picture thousands. Yes, thousands. That makes me\r\nthousands of times more pious than you Onists.

"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head wearily. "What\'s the use? It is for this we are\r\nfighting our war, and we thought if we took one of you here, showed him\r\nthe undeniable truth of our statue.... Well, will you at least return to\r\nyour people with a tale of what you have seen?"\r\n\r\nI agreed readily enough: probably, the alternative was death. Although\r\nPluralists on rare occasions have been known to take Onist women as\r\ntheir wives, an Onist prisoner of war was an unwanted thing. The reverse\r\nwould also be true.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey all bid me goodbye, except for Nari. I could not find her anywhere\r\nin the village, and a little sadly I set out on my long journey back to\r\nthe Sunset Land. By now our raiding party had finished its work on the\r\nsmall Onist village on the rim of our country, and I could do nothing\r\nbut return to my people, where we might plan new strategy against the\r\nunbelievers.\r\n\r\nBut I had wanted to bid Nari farewell.\r\n\r\nI met her in the woodlands, a travel bag slung over her shoulder like a\r\nmale\'s. "I wanted to say goodbye privately," she told me.\r\n\r\n"Good," I said, but I knew she was lying. Else why the travel bag?\r\n\r\n"Goodbye," Nari whispered, but she was not looking at me. Looking,\r\ninstead, behind her, at the land of her people.\r\n\r\n"Nari," I told her, "I have to admit it. You are very pretty--even by\r\nPluralist standards. You are--"\r\n\r\nThis time she did not stumble against me. It wasn\'t necessary. I drew\r\nher to me, and I kissed her a long kiss. Then I told her I loved her,\r\nand women, I suppose, will always be women, because she said she knew\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI will take Nari back to our village in the Sunset Land, where we will\r\nbe married by the laws of my people. And if ever there is to be peace\r\nbetween the Pluralists and the Onists, it may, after all, come on these\r\ngrounds. The Onists have their beliefs, and so I hate them for their\r\nimpious thoughts. But the love of a man for a maid exists apart from\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nIt won\'t be easy. Our arguing continued all the way back to the Sunset\r\nLand, and Nari is as stubborn as I am firm.\r\n\r\n"There is one Maker," she said.\r\n\r\nAnd I told her, "No, there are many."\r\n\r\nOr later, as we neared the Sunset Land, we picked up the thread of our\r\nthoughts again. Pluralist or Onist, we androids are dogmatic creatures.\r\n\r\n"One Robot created us all before he went to the stars," said Nari.\r\n\r\n"Robots," I said. "Many Robots." But I kissed her.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _If Worlds of Science Fiction_ July\r\n    1952.

I love him better than anyone else in the whole\r\nworld. Whenever the other kids tease me and call me Crazy Joe I go to\r\nGramp and he tells me funny stories and makes me laugh.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI remember the first time he told me about people hating other people\r\nwho are different.\r\n\r\n"Why do the kids call me Crazy Joe and laugh at me?" I asked him.\r\n\r\n"Well, you see," Gramp said slowly, "your Daddy worked for Uncle Sam\r\nin a big place where they make things that the government won\'t tell\r\nanybody about. Then your Daddy got sick from something in the big\r\nplace. After a long time he went up to stay with God. Then God took\r\nMommy too, when He gave you to her. And now you\'re our little boy,\r\nmine and Gramma\'s. And because you\'re a very special kind of little\r\nboy, the other children are jealous. So I wouldn\'t play with them any\r\nmore if they tease you. Just don\'t let them see you\'re afraid of them.\r\nYou\'ll always be Gramp\'s Little Joe."\r\n\r\nI love Gramp very much....\r\n\r\nWe kept walking until we came to Fayette. We went into Carl Van\r\nRemortal\'s store. Gramp sat on a chair by the big iron stove and I sat\r\non his knee on his good leg. The stove must be real old, because it\'s\r\ngot 1926 on its door in big iron letters.\r\n\r\n"Tell me the pictures you see in Mr. Van\'s mind," Gramp whispered in my\r\near, "but don\'t let him hear you."\r\n\r\n"He\'s making pictures of the fishing boats coming in," I said. "In the\r\npictures he\'s talking to Jack La Salle and giving him some money for\r\nhis fish.... The pictures are getting all mixed up now. He\'s putting\r\nthe fish in ice in boxes, but other pictures show him in church. Jack\r\nLa Salle is in the church too, and Mr. Van\'s sister Margaret is dressed\r\nin a long white dress and standing alongside him."\r\n\r\n"He\'s thinking that Jack La Salle will be marrying Margaret pretty\r\nsoon," Gramp said. "What else is he thinking?"\r\n\r\n"The pictures are coming so fast now that I can\'t name them all," I\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nMr. Lawrence St. Ours came into the store, and Gramp told me to read\r\nwhat he was thinking. I looked inside his head.\r\n\r\n"He\'s making pictures of himself driving a car, and buying bread, and\r\nbacon, and piling hay on his farm, and ..." I said, but then I had to\r\nstop. "All the pictures come so fast that I can\'t read them," I told\r\nGramp. "Everybody makes blurry pictures like that most of the time."\r\n\r\n"Instead of trying to tell me what the pictures are, see if you can\r\nunderstand what they mean," Gramp said.\r\n\r\nI tried but it was awful hard and pretty soon I got tired and Gramp and\r\nI left the store and went back home.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Gramp and I went out in the barn and Gramp said, "Now\r\nlet\'s see what we got here." He had me try to do a lot of things, like\r\nlifting something without touching it, and trying to make chickens run\r\nby making a picture of them doing that and putting it in their minds.\r\nBut I couldn\'t do any of them.\r\n\r\nAfter a while he said, "Let\'s go down to the store again."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe went to the store almost every day after that. Then sometimes we\r\njust walked around Fayette, and Gramp had me practice reading what the\r\npictures in people\'s minds meant instead of just what they looked like.\r\nSometimes I did it real good. Then Gramp would buy me some candy or ice\r\ncream.\r\n\r\nOne day we were following Mr. Mears and I was telling Gramp what I saw\r\nin Mr. Mears\' mind when Mr. 

St. Ours drove by in his car. 

"Mr. Mears is\r\nmaking pictures about feeding meat to Mr. St. Ours\'s dog and the dog is\r\ncrawling away and dying," I said to Gramp.\r\n\r\nGramp was real interested. He said, "Watch close and read everything\r\nyou can about that." I did. After, Gramp seemed very happy. He bought\r\nme a big chocolate bar that time. Chocolate is my best kind of candy.\r\n\r\nI read lots of things in other people\'s minds that made Gramp feel good\r\ntoo, and he bought me candy just about every day.\r\n\r\nGramp seemed to have money all the time now instead of having to ask\r\nGramma for any. She wanted to know where he got all the money. But he\r\njust smiled with his right cheek like he does and wouldn\'t tell her.\r\nMost of the people in town didn\'t seem to like Gramp any more. They\r\nmade mad pictures about him whenever we met them.\r\n\r\nSometimes when we were in the store Mrs. Van would come in and she\r\nwould talk to me. She was awful nice. But she always had sad pictures\r\nin her mind and sometimes she would cough real hard and hold a\r\nhandkerchief up in front of her mouth.\r\n\r\nWhen she did that Mr. Van used to get sad too. In his pictures Mrs. Van\r\nwould be dead and laying in a coffin and they would be burying her in\r\na big hole in the ground. Mr. 

Van was nice too. He gave me crackers and\r\ncookies, or sometimes a big thin slice of cheese.\r\n\r\nOne night Gramp was holding me and buying some groceries and Mr. Van\r\nwas putting them in a cardboard box, and he was thinking about going to\r\nthe bank in Escanaba and cashing a check. And the man gave him a big\r\nhandful of money.\r\n\r\nI told Gramp, but then Mr. Van came close. I didn\'t say anymore, like\r\nGramp had told me. Mr. 

Van was whistling now. He made pictures of\r\ngiving the money to Mrs. Van. She was getting on a train and going to\r\na place where it was sunny all the time, and her cough went away and\r\nshe wasn\'t skinny any more. In his mind Mrs. Van was real pretty. She\r\ndidn\'t have the long nose like she really has.\r\n\r\nWhen we got in our car Gramp was excited. He asked me where Mr. Van had\r\nput the money he brought back from Escanaba.\r\n\r\nHe had bad pictures in his mind about taking Mr. Van\'s money and I\r\ndidn\'t want to tell him. But he grabbed my arm so hard it hurt and I\r\nbegan to cry. Gramp never hurt me before.\r\n\r\n"What are you crying for?" he asked me, cranky.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want you to take Mr. Van\'s money," I told him.\r\n\r\nGramp let go of my arm and didn\'t say anything for a while.\r\n\r\n"Sometimes the pictures you see aren\'t true," he said. "You know that."\r\nHe took out his blue handkerchief and made me blow my nose. "Like when\r\nyou see pictures in Gramma\'s mind about her hurting me," he said. "She\r\nnever does, you know. 

So the pictures aren\'t true. It\'s just what we\r\ncall imagination."\r\n\r\n"But your pictures are bad! They make me scared," I said.\r\n\r\n"We all make bad pictures like that, but we don\'t mean them," Gramp\r\nsaid. "Remember how you said that you\'d like to eat the whole apple pie\r\nlast Sunday? You probably made pictures of doing that. 

But you never\r\ndid, because you know that Gramma and me should have some of it too." I\r\nguess Gramp can explain just about everything.\r\n\r\nSo I told him where Mr. Van had hid the money under a box of brown\r\nsugar. Gramp smiled and started the car.\r\n\r\nHe let me steer while it was going slow. "Who\'s my Chum?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I am," I said, and I laughed real happy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next day when I got up Gramp was gone.\r\n\r\nI went back of the barn and played. I got a bunch of tin cans and\r\npunched holes in them with a nail like Gramp showed me, and I made\r\nsteps out of rocks and put a can on each step. I poured water in the\r\ntop can. It ran through the holes from each can to the other all the\r\nway down the steps.\r\n\r\nI heard our car come in the front yard.\r\n\r\nI went around the barn, and Gramp was just going up the steps to the\r\nhouse. He had been to Fairport where the big store is, and he had\r\nbought a lot of things that he was carrying in his arms. At first I was\r\nglad because he had bought something that was for me too.\r\n\r\nBut then I saw some bad pictures mixed with the happy ones--of Gramp\r\nbreaking a window in Mr. Van\'s store when it was dark and going in and\r\ntaking something from underneath the brown sugar box.\r\n\r\n"You told me you wouldn\'t take Mr. Van\'s money. 

And you did!" I said.\r\n\r\n"Ssh," Gramp said. He put his packages on the porch and sat down and\r\ntook me on his lap. He took a deep breath. "Remember what I told you\r\nabout imagination, Chum?" he asked me. "So you know you\'re not supposed\r\nto believe all the pictures you see. Now you\'re Gramp\'s Chum. And I\r\nwant you to promise me again not to tell anyone but me what you see,\r\nand I\'ll tell you if the pictures are real or not. Promise?"\r\n\r\nI promised, and Gramp opened one of the packages. He took out two new\r\npistols and a belt with double holsters to carry them in. He bent over\r\nand buckled them on me.\r\n\r\n"You look just like Hoppy now," he said.\r\n\r\nI gave him a big kiss, and ran back of the barn to shoot robbers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon Gramp was playing he was a bad Indian and trying to\r\nscalp me when a strange car drove in our yard.\r\n\r\nMr. Van and two men with badges got out.\r\n\r\nMr. 

Van was real mad. "We\'ve come after the money, Bill," he said.\r\n\r\nGramp got white. He was scared, but he said, loud, "What the hell are\r\nyou talking about?"\r\n\r\n"You know what, Bill," Mr. 

Van said. "Someone saw you break into the\r\nstore. It will go easier on you if you admit it."\r\n\r\n"I told you I don\'t know what you\'re talking about," Gramp said. His\r\neyes moved kind of quick. 

Then he noticed me and he walked over to\r\nme. "That\'s a fine way to talk in front of the boy," he said over his\r\nshoulder. He took my hand. "Come on, Chum. 

We\'re going in the house."\r\n\r\n"Just a minute," the biggest policeman said. "We\'ve got a few questions\r\nthat we have to ask you."\r\n\r\nGramp made believe he was brushing some dirt from my pants. "Did anyone\r\nsee me take the money, Chum?" he whispered to me.\r\n\r\n"No," I said, even though I didn\'t understand exactly. "Mr. Van is just\r\npretending he knows you took it but he doesn\'t."\r\n\r\n"Good boy." Gramp patted me on the head. "Go into the house now."\r\n\r\nHe turned and walked back to the three men, pushing his wooden leg into\r\nthe ground hard. I didn\'t go in the house, though.\r\n\r\n"Now I\'ve had just about enough of this," Gramp said, with a big frown\r\non his face. "You can\'t bluff me, Van. Say what you got to say, and\r\nget off my property."\r\n\r\nMr. Van\'s shoulders seemed to sag and he got sad. He made the pictures\r\nin his mind of Mrs. Van being dead and being put in a big hole.\r\n\r\nIt made me so sorry I couldn\'t stand it, and I cried, "Tell him you got\r\nhis money under the seat in our car! Please, Gramp! 

Give it back to\r\nhim."\r\n\r\nNobody said anything, but everybody turned and looked at me.\r\n\r\nThey stood real still. I saw in Gramp\'s mind that I had been bad, bad.\r\nI ran to him and put my face in his coat and began to cry. I couldn\'t\r\nhelp it.\r\n\r\nAfter a minute Gramp knelt on his good knee in front of me and took my\r\ncheeks in both his hands.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve let you down, Chum," he said. He wasn\'t mad any more.\r\n\r\nHe picked me up in his arms. "You needed me, Little Joe," he said. "You\r\nneeded me." 

His eyes were all smudgy. He squeezed me so hard I couldn\'t\r\nbreathe, almost.\r\n\r\nThen he put me down and said, "Come on," to the two policemen. He\r\nwalked away between them.\r\n\r\nGramp!\r\n\r\nThe pictures in his mind were awful. I could hardly bear to look at\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe worst picture was--me.\r\n\r\nI cried and cried.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Security Council was in emergency session. The four delegates would\r\nhave had easier consciences had more nations been represented, but it\r\nwas hard to travel now. Only Russia, England and France were able to\r\nsend their men to New York.\r\n\r\nSergei Moskov, USSR, presided unofficially. He wore a harried look, and\r\naddressed them wearily.\r\n\r\n"To think, gentlemen, that it has taken circumstances like these to\r\nbring us into accord!"\r\n\r\nThe others said nothing. Overhead, above New York\'s stone and glass UN\r\nbuilding that had been conceived in hope and wrought with faith, they\r\ncould hear the whine of the patrolling ships. The delegates stared at\r\nthe table in front of them.\r\n\r\n"Your country, Mr. Conrad," Moskov said to the American\r\nrepresentative, "is the mother of our last hope." He looked around the\r\ntable for concurrence. 

Sir Manly straightened a bit, and M. Tourneau\'s\r\nmustache twitched, but they all nodded. What use national pride now?\r\nThere was not much time, anyway. Tonight....\r\n\r\n"He will be here?" 

Moskov asked.\r\n\r\nConrad cleared his throat. He reached into his coat pocket and pulled\r\nout a slip of paper.\r\n\r\n"Joe--I mean, Dr. Waters--sent an answer to our request." He read:\r\n\r\n    "\'I take my vorpal sword in hand. Beware, Jabberwock--I come. Joe\r\n    Waters.\'"\r\n\r\n"The courage of youth," Sir Manly said, but he smiled.\r\n\r\nMoskov looked at his watch. "He should be here, then."\r\n\r\n"I am."\r\n\r\nThey all turned at the sound of that voice, and rose as Joe Waters\r\nstrode in. Just thirty years old, athletic, brilliant. He was\r\naccompanied by a wizened character in a baggy brown suit and crumpled\r\nfelt hat.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen." Joe said, and bowed. They all sat down.\r\n\r\n"A friend," he explained, indicating his companion. "Name of Mike."\r\n\r\n"Friend _and_ buddy," Mike said in a whiskey-hoarse voice.\r\n\r\n"We thought you understood, Dr. Waters," Moskov said, eyeing Mike\r\ndistastefully, "that this was to be a secret conference."\r\n\r\nM. Tourneau, who had a sensitive nose, shifted his chair slightly away\r\nfrom the bum.\r\n\r\nJoe said, "I met Mike in a bar last night and he\'s been with me since.\r\nI like his unsophisticated point of view."\r\n\r\n"Bar!" Sir Manly exclaimed, visibly shaken.\r\n\r\n"Bar." Joe answered. 

"For the same reason I\'m here now." He leaned\r\nforward.\r\n\r\n"I happened to be looking at the moon with my girl when they blew it\r\nup." His eyes narrowed at the memory. "She started to cry, and was\r\nstill at it when we got back to her apartment. That\'s when I went to\r\na bar to get drunk. It\'s also one reason I\'m here. When they take the\r\nmoon away from lovers, it\'s the last straw!"\r\n\r\n"Give \'em hell, kid!" Mike rasped. Joe silenced him with a wave of his\r\nhand, and Mike slouched down in his chair looking hurt.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Conrad," Moskov said, "will you be good enough to give Dr. Waters\r\nthe latest developments?

"\r\n\r\n"All right. 

Joe, you know what\'s happened this past week."\r\n\r\nJoe nodded.\r\n\r\n"In case you didn\'t get the overall picture--their ships," he jerked\r\na thumb at the whine passing back and forth above, "have completely\r\nblanketed the world. They have destroyed every means of defense we\'ve\r\nused against them. 

Atomic anti-aircraft, even, hasn\'t fazed them in the\r\nleast.\r\n\r\n"Yesterday they sent for us. The head of their expedition told us who\r\nthey are, and it accounts, perhaps, for their anthropoidal appearance.\r\nThey are from Jupiter, so it\'s not inconceivable after all that similar\r\nforms of life should become dominant in the same solar system.\r\n\r\n"They are easily twice our size--and if ability to learn and speak\r\nfluently in a half hour, each of the three languages represented here\r\nmeans anything, they have a proportionate I.Q.\r\n\r\n"Their leader, Slan, says his title means he is the crown prince\r\nof the royal Jovian family. Slan was nothing if not courteous and\r\nchivalrous. He told us yesterday he would give us a sporting chance for\r\nsurvival--why, I can\'t imagine. Apparently this expedition is like a\r\nglorified fox hunt to them.\r\n\r\n"We are to choose a person to represent the world in an intellectual\r\nduel with him. If we win, they withdraw completely, never to bother us\r\nagain. If we lose, then, he said, we\'re not worth saving and we\'ll be\r\ncompletely destroyed--hunted individually, which to them is great sport.\r\n\r\n"To prove they could do it, he had his ship\'s guns turn on the moon.\r\nYou saw what happened--disintegrated completely."\r\n\r\n"Them crumbs!" Mike grated. "We\'ll murder \'em, Joe!"\r\n\r\n"Quiet, Mike."\r\n\r\nMike grumbled, pulled out a cigarette paper and tobacco and rolled his\r\nown.\r\n\r\n"That\'s why we\'ve called on you," Conrad said.\r\n\r\n"Waters," Sir Manly said, "the world rests on your shoulders."\r\n\r\n"You have every qualification," M. Tourneau put in.\r\n\r\n"Your brilliant theories in symbolic logic and theoretical\r\nmathematics," said Sir Manly.\r\n\r\n"Chess champion of the world," Moskov added respectfully.\r\n\r\n"Your contributions to astrophysics," Conrad said.\r\n\r\n"And don\'t you guys ferget--he won the decathlon when he was just a\r\nhigh school kid. He\'ll murder them bums!

"\r\n\r\nJoe smiled. 

"Don\'t mind my pugnacious friend."\r\n\r\n"You are, so far as we know, the finest representative the world\r\ncould have." Moskov looked serious, and Joe became aware suddenly of\r\nthe awful burden involved. What use intellectual ability or athletic\r\nprowess, compared to Jovian standards? Wasn\'t there someone--even a\r\nscience-fiction writer, perhaps--better qualified to handle a situation\r\nas fantastic as this? Apparently not.\r\n\r\n"When\'s the funeral?" Joe asked drily.\r\n\r\n"Please, m\'sieu, a little respect for the situation!" M. Tourneau\r\nlooked pained.\r\n\r\n"The contest is to be in Slan\'s ship at eight o\'clock tonight," Moskov\r\nanswered. "They will pick you up here in five hours."\r\n\r\n"You and me both, Joe," Mike said.\r\n\r\n"Yeah," Joe answered, and now he was mentally reeling under the impact\r\nof his responsibility. "Let\'s have a drink first. I think we\'ll need\r\none.

"\r\n\r\nSir Manly paled. "I say...."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll murder them damn Greeks," Mike chortled.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Shay, I\'m not goin\' in that thing," Mike protested.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t fight \'em if we don\'t," Joe answered mournfully.\r\n\r\n"They\'re big enough, all right," Mike admitted respectfully. "Wouldn\'t\r\nsome football coach like to have one o\' _them_ on his squad!"\r\n\r\n"C\'mon, le\'s go." Joe shoved Mike toward the waiting ship, at the door\r\nof which a behemoth of a figure waited patiently, watching with some\r\napparent disdain as the two, arms around each other\'s shoulders, weaved\r\nunsteadily inside.\r\n\r\nInside the ship, Joe took a long pull at the bottle Mike passed him.\r\nStrange, he thought, how an unforseeable factor, upsetting life\'s\r\nroutine equations, produces unguessed mental reactions. Until last\r\nnight he\'d never had a drink in his life. 

Then a little thing like the\r\nmoon being blown up. Aloud he quoted,\r\n\r\n    "\'Yet what are all such mysteries to me\r\n    Whose life is full of indices and surds?\r\n    x^2 + 7x + 53 - 11/3\'"\r\n\r\n"Whassat?"\r\n\r\n"Lewish Carroll," Joe answered, and wondered greatly at the vast\r\namounts of liquor he had consumed in a short space of time.\r\n\r\n    "\'Beware the Jabberwock, my son....\'"\r\n\r\nAnd Joe Waters, the world\'s most brilliant human, passed out.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey left Joe in the ship and dragged Mike before Slan. That gigantic\r\nfigure sat in regal splendor at the end of a long corridor that ran the\r\nlength of the vessel. On either side of Mike, as he stumbled toward the\r\nthrone which seemed miles away, uniformed giants stood at attention.\r\nHad he stretched his arm he might have been able to rap a belt buckle.\r\nThe sensation of being a pygmy increased as he approached Slan.\r\n\r\nGrouped around Slan, whose throne was on a platform several feet\r\nhigh, stood members of what seemed to be a retinue. They sneered and\r\nsnickered as Mike drew near, and Mike had to strain his neck and\r\nblurred eyes to see them.\r\n\r\n"Are you ready to begin?" Slan asked in a voice that nearly deafened\r\nMike.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll murder ya, ya bums," Mike answered belligerently. His\r\nwhiskey-fogged mind somehow assumed Joe was still by his side.\r\n\r\n"Very well, then." And Slan extended an arm toward Mike, thumb pointed\r\nup.\r\n\r\nMike promptly repeated the gesture, except that he pointed _his_ thumb\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nSlan reached for a huge flagon of red liquid, which he poured slowly\r\nonto the floor. Mike stared, then reached into a hip pocket and\r\nproduced a bottle of whiskey, swallowed some and vigorously smacked his\r\nlips. Then he held the bottle out to Slan, grinning broadly.\r\n\r\nSlan reached into a bag at his side, took out a handful of colored\r\npebbles, and scattered them on the floor. Mike scrambled after them and\r\nstuffed them into his pocket, then struggled erect, panting with the\r\nexertion.\r\n\r\nSlan arose from his throne, stepped off the platform, and towered over\r\nMike.\r\n\r\n"You surprise me," he boomed. "You and your little planet are smarter\r\nthan I expected. Go, and tell your people that they could not have\r\nchosen a worthier representative."\r\n\r\nIt was a dazed and confused Mike who was led stumbling, and clutching\r\nhis bottle, back to the ship which was to take him to a free world.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSlan, meanwhile, found himself besieged by annoyed and puzzled\r\nfollowers. He held up his hand for silence, and relapsed into native\r\nJovian.\r\n\r\n"That earthling," he said sarcastically, "seems to have fared better\r\nthan you who are so proud of your intellects.\r\n\r\n"When I held my thumb up, indicating our superiority in size and\r\nstrength, he pointed his thumb down, to show that physical power is\r\nreally of minor importance.\r\n\r\n"I poured a red liquid onto the floor, dramatizing the effect of\r\nconflict on them, if that should be my wish. He demonstrated his\r\nfearlessness by producing a light-colored liquid and sampling it with\r\nenjoyment--as his kind would react to such an encounter.\r\n\r\n"Finally I flung out a handful of colored pebbles, displaying the\r\nconfusing array of languages, races, and ideas their world contains. He\r\nscooped them into his pocket, showing that their diversity could still\r\nbe united into single purpose."\r\n\r\nSlan looked contemptuously at the crestfallen faces of his men.\r\n\r\n"It would be to our benefit if we had half their spirit in proportion\r\nto our size," he said. Then he bellowed,\r\n\r\n"Order all ships to withdraw at once!" To an aide he muttered, "We\'ll\r\nleave this planet to those worthy of it."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMike and Joe were hiding from a world delirious with joy and anxious to\r\nheap glory upon its saviour--whom they thought was Joe Waters. Joe had\r\nno intention of deluding the world in this regard, but right now he was\r\nplying Mike with whiskey to get from him the story of what happened.\r\n\r\nThey were in the rear booth of a bar, and Mike kept insisting that Joe\r\nknew perfectly well what had happened because he\'d been right there.\r\n\r\n"All right," Joe said coaxingly, "I know what happened. But tell me how\r\nyou\'re going to tell it, so we can get our stories straight."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t understan\' it," Mike said thickly, shaking his head. "The guy\r\nwas nuts."\r\n\r\n"What happened?" Joe pleaded. Mike, who apparently had no saturation\r\npoint, gulped some more whiskey.\r\n\r\n"First thing," he said, "the guy sticks his thumb up in the air, like\r\nhe\'s gonna give me the bum\'s rush. So I point mine down--if he tries to\r\nkick me outa there before we even get a chance to talk business, I\'ll\r\nfloor \'im."\r\n\r\n"Yeah, you would."\r\n\r\nMike ignored this comment, took yet another drink and wiped his lips on\r\nthe back of his hand. Joe watched this display of alcoholic immunity\r\nwith admiration, and Mike continued.\r\n\r\n"Then he takes a bottle of this awful-looking wine and pours it out on\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\n"No wonder they been raising such a rumpus, Joe. With nothing but that\r\nstuff to drink, I would too! So I pulled out my flask and took a swig,\r\nto show what we\'ve got, and I offer him some. You know something, Joe,"\r\nand Mike leaned forward earnestly, "when that guy saw the kind of stuff\r\nwe drink he got a new respect, \'cause he takes a handful of jewels and\r\nrolls \'em at me. Now, I don\'t look no gift horse in the teeth--I pocket\r\n\'em as fast as I get my hands on \'em. I got the rocks with me--here."\r\n\r\nHe pulled out the "pebbles" Slan had referred to--and jewels they were.\r\nFire shot from diamonds, rubies, emeralds, amethysts. Joe whistled.\r\n\r\n"We can use the money that stuff will bring."\r\n\r\n"Buy a liquor store?" Mike asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n"Finance the development and launching of an interplanetary expedition."\r\n\r\n"Ah, what the hell you want to do that for?"\r\n\r\n"They\'ve got eleven moons," Joe said grimly, "and all we want is one."\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\n    _That first trip to the moon has been the subject of many stories.\r\n    Mr. Vandenburg has come up with as novel a twist as we\'ve ever read._\r\n\r\n    _And it could happen._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ajax XX was the first American space craft to make a successful\r\nlanding on the moon. She had orbited the Earth\'s natural satellite for a\r\nday and a half before making history. 

The reason for orbiting was\r\nimportant. The Russians had been boasting for a number of years that\r\nthey would be first. Captain Junius Robb, U.S.A.F., had orders to\r\ninvestigate before and after landing.\r\n\r\nThe moon\'s dark side was explored, due to the unknown hazards involved,\r\nduring the orbiting process. More thorough investigation was possible on\r\nthe moon\'s familiar side. The results seemed to be incontrovertible.\r\nCaptain Junius Robb and his crew of four were the first humans to tread\r\nthe ashes of the long dead heavenly body. The Russians, for all their\r\nboasts, had never come near the place.\r\n\r\nThe Ajax XX stood tall and gaunt and mighty, framed against the\r\nforbidding blackness of space. Captain Robb had maneuvered her down to\r\nthe middle of an immense crater, which the crew came to nickname "the\r\ncoliseum without seats."\r\n\r\nRobb had orders not to leave the ship. Consequently, the crew of four\r\nscrupulously chosen, well-integrated men split into two groups of two.\r\nFor three days they labored at gathering specimens, conducting countless\r\ntests and piling up as much data as time and weight would allow. Captain\r\nRobb kept them well reminded of the weight problem attached to the\r\nreturn trip.\r\n\r\nNear the end of the third day Captain Robb contacted his far flung crew\r\nmembers over helmet intercom. He ordered them back to the Ajax XX for a\r\nbriefing session.\r\n\r\nSoon the men entered the ship. They were hot, uncomfortable and\r\nexhausted. Once back on Earth they could testify that there was nothing\r\nromantic about a thirty-five-pound pressure suit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHamston, the rocket expert, summed it up: "With that damn bulb over his\r\nskull a man is helpless to remove a single bead of perspiration. He\r\ncould easily develop into a raving maniac.

"\r\n\r\nRobb held his meeting in the control room. "You have eight hours to\r\nfinish your work, gentlemen. We\'re blasting off at 0900."\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon, Captain," said Kingsley, the young man in charge of\r\nradio operation, "but what about Washington? They haven\'t made contact\r\nyet and I thought--"\r\n\r\n"I talked with Washington an hour ago!"\r\n\r\nA modest cheer of approval went up from the crew members.\r\n\r\n"Well, why didn\'t you say so before!" said Anderson, the first officer.\r\n\r\nRobb explained. "It seems _their_ equipment has been haywire for two\r\ndays, they haven\'t been able to get through.

"\r\n\r\n"How do you like that!" cracked Farnsworth, the astrogator. "We\'re two\r\nhundred and forty thousand miles off the Earth and our equipment works\r\nfine. They have all the comforts of Earth down at headquarters and they\r\ncan\'t repair radio transmission for two days!"\r\n\r\nThe men laughed.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen," Robb continued, "every radio and TV network in the country\r\nwas hooked up to the chief\'s office in Washington. I not only talked to\r\nGeneral Lovett, I spoke to the whole damn country.

"\r\n\r\nThe men could not contain their excitement. The captain received a\r\nverbal pelting of stored-up questions.\r\n\r\n"Did you get word to my family, Captain?" asked Kingsley.\r\n\r\n"I hope you told them we\'re physically sound, Captain," said Farnsworth.\r\n"I have a fianc\xc3\xa9e that\'ll never forgive me if anything happens to me--"\r\n\r\n"What\'s the reaction like around the country--"\r\n\r\n"Have the Russians had anything to say yet--"\r\n\r\n"Ha! I\'ll bet they\'re sore as hell--"\r\n\r\n"Do you think the army would mind if I hand in my resignation?"\r\nKingsley\'s remark brought vigorous applause from the others.\r\n\r\nCaptain Robb held up his hand for silence. "Hold on! 

Hold on! First of\r\nall, General Lovett has personally contacted relatives and told them\r\nwe\'re all physically and mentally sound. Secondly, you\'d better get set\r\nto receive the biggest damn welcome in history. The general says half\r\nthe nation has invaded Florida for the occasion."\r\n\r\n"Tell them we\'re not coming back," snapped Kingsley, "until the Florida\r\nTourist Bureau gives us a cut."\r\n\r\n"Kingsley, the President has declared a national holiday. We\'ll all be\r\nable to write our own ticket."\r\n\r\n"Yes," Anderson put in, "to hell with the Florida Tourist Bureau!"\r\n\r\nCaptain Robb said, "We\'ll be so sick of parades we\'ll wish we\'d stayed\r\nin this God forsaken place."\r\n\r\n"Not me," boasted Farnsworth. "I\'m ready for a parade in my honor any\r\nold time. 

The sooner the better."\r\n\r\n"Oh, and about the Russians," said Captain Robb, smiling. "There\'s been\r\nnothing but a steady stream of \'no comment\' out of the Kremlin since we\r\nlanded here."\r\n\r\n"Right now," said Hamston, "it\'s probably high noon for every scientist\r\nbehind the iron curtain."\r\n\r\n"I wonder how they plan to talk their way out of this one?" asked\r\nFarnsworth.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen, I\'d like to go on talking about the welcome we\'re going to\r\nreceive, but I think we\'d better take first things first. Before there\r\ncan be a welcome we have to get back. And we still have work to do\r\nbefore we start."\r\n\r\n"What about souvenirs, Captain?" asked Farnsworth.\r\n\r\nRobb pursed his lips thoughtfully, "Yes, I guess there is a matter of\r\nsouvenirs, isn\'t there."\r\n\r\nThe others detected a note of disturbance in the way the captain spoke.\r\n\r\nKingsley asked, "Is anything wrong, Captain?"\r\n\r\nRobb laughed with a noticeable lack of enthusiasm. "Nothing is wrong,\r\nKingsley. The fact is we\'ve taken on enough additional weight here to\r\ngive us some concern on the return trip." He paused to study the faces\r\nof his men. They were disappointed. "But," he added emphatically, "I\r\nseem to remember promising something about souvenirs--and I guess a man\r\ncan\'t travel five hundred thousand miles without something to show for\r\nit. I\'ll get together with Hamston and work out something. But remember\r\nthat weight problem. First trouble we encounter on the return trip and a\r\nsouvenir will be our number one expendable."\r\n\r\nThe crew was more than happy with Robb\'s compromise. Robb went into a\r\nhuddle with Hamston, the rocket expert. When he emerged he informed the\r\ncrew that each man would be permitted one souvenir which must not exceed\r\ntwo pounds. He allowed them four hours to find whatever they wanted. The\r\nmen got back into their pressure suits and left the ship.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCaptain Junius Robb stood outside the Ajax XX. His eyes scanned the\r\ngreat circular plain that stretched for fifty miles in all directions.\r\nThe distant jagged rises of the crater\'s rim resembled the lower half of\r\na gigantic bear trap.\r\n\r\nThe moon in all its splendor--wasn\'t there a song that went something\r\nlike that?--the moon in all its splendor, or lack of it was Robb\'s mute\r\nopinion. The scientists, as usual, were right about the place. To all\r\nintents and purposes the moon was as dead as The Roman Empire. True they\r\nhad found scattered vegetation; there were even two or three volcanoes\r\nspewing carbonic acid, but they spewed it as though it were life\'s last\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\nNothing more. The fires of the moon had given way to soft lifeless\r\nashes.\r\n\r\nRobb was glad he had allowed the men to look for souvenirs. After all,\r\nit wasn\'t a hell of a lot to ask for. A man could cut press clippings\r\nand collect medals and frame citations; and probably these things would\r\nimpress grandchildren someday. But it seemed that nothing would be quite\r\nas effective as for a man to be able to produce something tangible, an\r\nauthentic piece of the moon itself.\r\n\r\nCaptain Robb had always tried to be a humble man. He recalled an\r\ninterview held by the three wire services a week before take-off. One of\r\nthe reporters had asked the obvious question, "Why do you want to go to\r\nthe moon?" He could have given all of the high sounding, aesthetic\r\nreasons, but instead his answer was indirect, given with a modest smile.\r\n"To get to the other side, I guess," he had told them.\r\n\r\nLike the chicken crossing the road, that was how simple and\r\nuncomplicated Robb\'s life had been. But now he stood, his feet spread\r\napart, beside his mighty ship, a quarter of a million miles away from\r\nhome. He was the first! And he could not fight back the feeling of pride\r\nand accomplishment that welled in him. The word "first" in this instance\r\nconjured up names like Balboa, Columbus, Peary, Magellan--and Junius\r\nRobb.\r\n\r\nThe crew members deserved the hero\'s welcome they would receive. They\r\ncould have the banquets, parades and honorary degrees. But it was Junius\r\nRobb who had commanded the flight. It would be Junius Robb\'s name for\r\nthe history books.\r\n\r\nHe wouldn\'t be needing any souvenirs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKingsley and Anderson were the first to return. They both carried small\r\nleather bags. Inside the ship they revealed the contents to Robb. He\r\nexamined them carefully.\r\n\r\nKingsley had found an uncommonly large patch of brownish vegetation. He\r\nhad torn away a sizeable chunk and placed it in the bag. "Who knows?" 

he\r\nshrugged. 

"I might be able to cultivate it."\r\n\r\n"Or let it play the lead in a science fiction movie," snapped Anderson.\r\n\r\nThe first officer\'s bag contained a piece of one of the smaller craters.\r\nIt had no immediately discernable value. It was Anderson\'s intention to\r\npolish it up and put some kind of a metal plaque on it.\r\n\r\nFour more hours went by and there was no sign of Farnsworth or Hamston.\r\nRobb began to worry. He\'d never forgive himself if anything happened to\r\neither of the two men. He waited another half hour, then ordered Kinsley\r\nand Anderson to put on their pressure suits and go look for the two\r\nmissing crew members.\r\n\r\nThe search was avoided as Farnsworth entered the ship dragging Hamston\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\n"What happened!" yelled Robb.\r\n\r\nFarnsworth began the job of getting out of his pressure suit. "I don\'t\r\nknow. Hamston\'s sick as a dog. I checked every inch of his suit and\r\ncouldn\'t find anything out of order."\r\n\r\nRobb bent over the prone rocket expert. Hamston looked up at him with\r\nhalf-opened eyes and an insipid grin on his face. He mumbled something\r\nabout "a fine state of affairs."\r\n\r\nThey removed Hamston\'s suit and placed his limp frame on a bunk. Robb\r\nexamined him for forty minutes.\r\n\r\nHe reached the curious conclusion that Hamston was as fit as a fiddle.\r\n\r\nThe rocket expert fell asleep. Robb and the rest of the crew prepared to\r\nblast off.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Ajax XX thrust itself through space, halfway back to its home\r\nplanet.\r\n\r\nThe excitement of her crew members grew with every passing second. In\r\nhis concern over Hamston, Farnsworth had forgotten about his souvenir.\r\nHe now opened his bag and displayed it before the others.\r\n\r\n"What is it?" asked Kingsley.\r\n\r\n"Dust!" was Farnsworth\'s proud reply.\r\n\r\n"What the hell you going to do with dust?"\r\n\r\n"Maybe you don\'t know it but this is going to be the most valuable dust\r\non the face of the Earth! Do you realize what I can get for an ounce of\r\nthis stuff?"\r\n\r\n"What\'s anybody want to buy dust for?"\r\n\r\n"Souvenirs, man, souvenirs!"\r\n\r\nFarnsworth asked to see what Kingsley and Anderson had picked up. The\r\ntwo men obliged. For the next hour the three men and Robb discussed the\r\nmementoes and their possible uses on Earth.\r\n\r\nThen Anderson said, "I sure wouldn\'t turn down about a gallon of good\r\nKentucky whiskey right now!"\r\n\r\nRobb laughed. 

"We did enough sweating on the way. You wouldn\'t want to\r\nsweat out the trip back on a belly full of booze.

"\r\n\r\n"That may be a better idea than you think it is, Captain."\r\n\r\nThe four men turned to find Hamston sitting up on his bunk.\r\n\r\n"Hamston!" Robb exclaimed, "how do you feel?"\r\n\r\n"Terrible."\r\n\r\n"What happened to you?" asked Kingsley.\r\n\r\nHamston stared at each man individually. He took a deep breath and his\r\ncheeks puffed up as he let it out slowly. "Well, I guess you\'d better\r\nknow now."\r\n\r\nRobb frowned. 

"What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Farnsworth and I separated after we got about four miles from the ship.\r\nI thought I saw something that looked like a cave. I figured I might\r\nfind something interesting there to take back with me. So I told\r\nFarnsworth I\'d keep radio contact with him and off I went."\r\n\r\n"Did you find a cave?" Robb wanted to know.\r\n\r\n"No, it was just a big indentation in the wall of the crater. I threw\r\nsome light on it and found it to be ten or fifteen feet deep." He paused\r\nas though not sure of what to say next.\r\n\r\n"So?"\r\n\r\n"So that\'s where I found my souvenir."\r\n\r\n"Well, let\'s see it!" said Anderson.\r\n\r\nHamston opened his leather bag. The object he removed rendered the crew\r\nweak in the knees. He said, "We can have that drink, Anderson, but I\r\ndon\'t think we\'ll enjoy it."\r\n\r\nHe poured them each a shot from a half-filled bottle of Vodka.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n


I know what I wanted to\r\nthink, but that\'s different from actually knowing.\r\n\r\nThere was the usual news just after Labor Day. The Dodgers were winning\r\nor losing, I forget which, and UCLA was strong and was going to beat\r\neverybody they met that fall. An H-bomb had been tested in the\r\nPacific, blowing another island off the map, just as if we had islands\r\nto spare. Ordinarily this was important, but now it wasn\'t. They put\r\nstuff like this in the back pages and hardly anybody reads it. There\r\nwas only one thing on the front pages and it was all people talked\r\nabout. All I talked about, anyway.\r\n\r\nIt began long before. I don\'t know how long because they didn\'t print\r\nthat. But it began and there it was, right upon us that day. It\r\nwas Saturday. Big things always seem to happen on Saturdays. I ate\r\nbreakfast and got out early. I had the usual things to do, mowing the\r\nlawn, for instance. I didn\'t do it nor anything else and nobody said\r\nanything. There wasn\'t any use in mowing the lawn on a day like that.\r\n\r\nI went out, remembering not to slam the door. It wasn\'t much, but it\r\nshowed thoughtfulness. I went past the church and looked at the sign\r\nthat was set diagonally at the corner so that it could be read from\r\nboth streets. There it was in big letters, quoting from the papers:\r\nTHIS IS THE DAY THE WORLD ENDS! Some smart reporter had thought it up\r\nand it seemed so true that that was the only way it was ever said. Me?\r\nI didn\'t know.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was a bright day. People were out walking or just standing and\r\nlooking at the sky. It was too early to look up. 

I went on. Paul\r\nEberhard was sitting on the lawn when I came along. He tossed me the\r\nfootball and I caught it and tried to spin it on my finger. It didn\'t\r\nspin. It fell and flopped out with crazy bounces into the street.\r\nThe milk truck stopped, while I got it out of the way. I tossed the\r\nfootball back to Paul. He put his hand on it and sat there.\r\n\r\n"What\'ll we do?" he said.\r\n\r\nI made a motion with my hands. "We can throw the ball around," I said.\r\n\r\n"Naw," he said. "Maybe you\'ve got some comic books."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve seen them all," I said. "You got some?"\r\n\r\n"I gave them to Howie," he said, thoughtfully screwing the point of the\r\nball into the center of a dandelion. "He said he was going to get some\r\nnew ones though. 

Let\'s go see." He got up and tossed the ball toward\r\nthe porch. It hit the railing and bounced back into the bushes. That\'s\r\nwhere he usually kept it.\r\n\r\n"Paul," called his mother as we started out.\r\n\r\n"Yeah?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t go far. I\'ve got some things I want you to do."\r\n\r\n"What?" he said patiently.\r\n\r\n"Hauling trash out of the basement. Helping me move some of the potted\r\nplants around in front."\r\n\r\n"Sure," he said. 

"I\'ll be back."\r\n\r\nWe went past another church on the way to Howie\'s. The sign was the\r\nsame there. THIS IS THE DAY THE WORLD ENDS! They never said more than\r\nthat. They wanted it to hang in our minds, something we couldn\'t quite\r\ntouch, but we knew was there.\r\n\r\nPaul jerked his head at the sign. "What do you think of it?

"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know." I broke off a twig as we passed a tree. "What about\r\nyou?

"\r\n\r\n"We got it coming." He looked at the sky.\r\n\r\n"Yeah, but will we get it?"\r\n\r\nHe didn\'t answer that. "I wonder if it will be bright?"\r\n\r\n"It is now."\r\n\r\n"It might cloud over."\r\n\r\n"It won\'t matter. It\'ll split the sky." That was one thing sure. Clouds\r\nor anything weren\'t going to stand in the way.\r\n\r\nWe went on and found Howie. Howie is a Negro, smaller than we are and\r\ntwice as fast. He can throw a football farther and straighter than\r\nanyone else on the team. We pal around quite a bit, especially in the\r\nfootball season.\r\n\r\nHe came out of the house like he was walking on whipped cream. I didn\'t\r\nlet that fool me. More than once I\'ve tried to tackle him during a\r\npractice game. Howie was carrying a model of a rocket ship, CO_2\r\npowered. It didn\'t work. 

We said hi all around and then he suggested a\r\ngame of keep-away. We\'d left the football at Paul\'s and we couldn\'t so\r\nwe walked over to the park.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe sat down and began talking about it. "I\'m wondering if it will\r\nreally come," said Paul. We all squinted up.\r\n\r\n"Where\'ll the President watch it from?" I said. "He should have a good\r\nview from the White House."\r\n\r\n"No better than us right here," said Howie.\r\n\r\n"What about Australia? Will they see it there?" I said.\r\n\r\n"They\'ll see it all over."\r\n\r\n"Africa, too? And what about the Eskimos?"\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t matter whether they actually see it or not. It will come to\r\neveryone at the same time."\r\n\r\nI didn\'t see how it could, but I didn\'t feel like an argument. That\'s\r\nwhat they were saying on TV and you can\'t talk back to that.\r\n\r\n"Everybody," said Howie. "Not just in this town, but all over. Wherever\r\nthere are people. Even where they\'re not."\r\n\r\n"You read that," said Paul.\r\n\r\n"Sure," said Howie. "You lent me the comic books. It\'s even in them.

"\r\n\r\nWe didn\'t say much after that. I kept thinking of the man who made\r\nthe H-bomb. I bet he felt silly and spiteful, blowing up an island.\r\nSomebody might have wanted to live on it, if he\'d just left it there.\r\nHe must have felt mean and low when something really big like this came\r\nalong.\r\n\r\nWe talked on for a while, but we\'d talked it out long ago. There was\r\nreally nothing new we could say. 

Every so often we\'d look up at the\r\nsky, but it wasn\'t going to come until it got here.\r\n\r\nFinally we drifted apart. There wasn\'t anything left to do. We walked\r\nhome with Howie and then I went with Paul, leaving him to come back to\r\nmy house. I looked at the lawn and without thinking about it got busy\r\nand mowed it. I surprised myself.\r\n\r\nIt was hot, or it seemed to me it was. I went in to eat. Ma came by and\r\nshut off the sound of TV. I could still see the picture in the other\r\nroom. The announcer was making faces, but, of course, I didn\'t hear\r\nwhat he said. He looked pretty funny, I thought. I thought we were all\r\nprobably pretty funny, moving our mouths and blinking our eyes and\r\nwaving our hands. Only nothing real was coming out. Not yet, anyway.\r\n\r\n"Sit still," said Ma. "It will happen without your help. It\'s going to\r\nbe all right."\r\n\r\n"Think so?" 

I said. She would have told me anything to keep me quiet.\r\nShe gets nervous when I fidget.\r\n\r\n"I think so," she said, giving me my allowance. It was early for that.\r\nUsually I didn\'t get it until after supper. "Why don\'t you run uptown\r\nand watch it from there?"\r\n\r\n"Maybe I will," I said, dabbling my hands in the water at the sink.\r\n"Are you going to go?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I\'m not. Why should I get into that mob? I can watch it just\r\nas well from here.

"\r\n\r\nSure she could. But it was not the same. Everybody I knew was going\r\nto be there. I changed shirts before I left. I took a rag and wiped\r\nthe dust from my shoes. I wasn\'t trying to be fussy or dressed up or\r\nanything. I just thought I should do it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was shade and sun on the streets and a few big clouds in the sky.\r\n\r\nA car slowed up and stopped beside me. The window rolled down and Jack\r\nGoodwin leaned toward me. "Going uptown?"\r\n\r\n"Yeah."\r\n\r\n"Want a lift?"\r\n\r\n"Sure." Actually I didn\'t. I\'d rather have walked, looking around as I\r\nwent.\r\n\r\nJack Goodwin grinned as I got in. He\'s got gray hair, where he has\r\nhair. The rest is bald. 

He looked me over. "I don\'t see any comets on\r\nyour shoulders," he said gravely.\r\n\r\n"I never had any," I said. Some people seem to think everyone under\r\nseventeen is a kid.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll be needing them," he said.\r\n\r\n"Maybe," I said. I ought to have walked.\r\n\r\nI never knew how slow a day could pass. I suppose I should have slept\r\nlate and kept busy doing something. This was worse than putting on a\r\nuniform and waiting until gametime. At least there was a coach on the\r\nfield to tell you what to do as you ran through the drill.\r\n\r\nJack Goodwin stopped at a light. I had a notion to get out. 

But I\r\ndidn\'t. Goodwin grinned again as the light changed and we started up.\r\n"I don\'t blame you for being edgy," he said. "It\'s the suspense. If we\r\nonly had some way of knowing for sure, radio maybe."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no radio," I said. "The calculations have been checked."\r\n\r\n"Sure, but maybe there\'s something we forgot. Or don\'t know. All sorts\r\nof things can go wrong."\r\n\r\nHe must have talked on and on, but I didn\'t listen. Howie and me and\r\nPaul had gone over everything he was saying.\r\n\r\n"Thanks," I said as he stopped and I got out.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t mention it," he said. He nearly scraped the rear fender of the\r\ncar as he drove off. It was a new car, too. 

He wasn\'t so bad. Maybe he\r\nwas just worried.\r\n\r\nI wandered to the newsstand and looked at magazines and pocketbooks.\r\nOld lady Simpson didn\'t ask me if I was going to buy and didn\'t chase\r\nme away. She was busy arguing with some customers. Even so it was the\r\nfirst time she didn\'t pay attention to me when I came in. I had a\r\ngood chance to look at things I never buy. There was nothing in them\r\nI wanted to see. I was thirsty. I had a coke and was still thirsty. I\r\nasked for a glass of water, drank half of it and went out.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDown the street there was a TV set in a store window. I watched it.\r\nThey were showing a street in India, people looking up. They flashed\r\nall around, to Italy, China, Brazil. Except for their clothes, it\r\nwasn\'t much different from here. They were all looking up.\r\n\r\nI did the same. For the first time I noticed there was a slight\r\novercast. Big billowing clouds had passed, but this was worse. I hoped\r\nit would clear away in time. Not that it really mattered.\r\n\r\nIt was more crowded than usual for Saturday, but at the same time it\r\nwas quiet. People were shopping, but they weren\'t really buying much or\r\nelse they bought it faster. Nobody wanted to miss it. They all seemed\r\nto have one eye on their lists and another on the clock.\r\n\r\nHowie and Paul came up the street and we nodded and said something. A\r\nfew other boys from the school passed by and we stopped. We gathered\r\ntogether. It was getting closer--and the space between the minutes was\r\ngrowing longer and longer.\r\n\r\nI looked at Paul\'s watch. He said it was on the minute. I decided there\r\nwas time to go in and get a candy bar. All of a sudden I was hungry. I\r\ndidn\'t know where it came from. I\'d had to stuff down lunch not long\r\nago. And now I was hungry.\r\n\r\nI went to a store and had to fight my way in. People were coming out.\r\nNot just customers, but the clerks and owner, too. There was a big\r\ntelevision screen inside, but nobody wanted to see it on that. They\r\nwanted to be outside where it would happen to them. Not just see it,\r\nhave it happen. The store was empty. Not closed--empty.\r\n\r\nI turned and rushed out to join the others. I couldn\'t miss it.\r\nThere were still minutes to go, but suppose there _had_ been a\r\nmiscalculation. I knew what that would mean, but even so I had to be\r\nthere. I would almost die, too.\r\n\r\nNow we were all looking up--all over the world people were, I suppose.\r\nIt was quiet. You could hear them breathing.\r\n\r\nAnd then it came, a flash across the sky, a silver streak, the biggest\r\nvapor trail there ever was. It went from this side to that side in no\r\ntime. It split the sky and was gone before the shock blast hit us.\r\nNobody said anything. We stood there and shivered and straightened up\r\nafter the rumbling sound passed.\r\n\r\nBut there was the vapor trail that stretched farther than anyone could\r\nsee. It would go around the world at least once before it came to an\r\nend somewhere in the desert. I saw my science teacher--he was trying to\r\nsmile, but couldn\'t. And then there was the pharmacist who had wanted\r\nto be a research chemist, but wasn\'t good enough.\r\n\r\nIn front of me, old Fred Butler who drives the bus to Orange Point and\r\nKing City cracked his knuckles. "He did it," he whispered. 

"All the way\r\nto Mars and back. Safe and right on schedule." He jumped up in the air\r\nand kept jumping up. He hadn\'t been that high off the ground in several\r\nyears. He never would be again unless he took an elevator. And I knew\r\nhe hated elevators.\r\n\r\nFactory whistles started blowing. They sounded louder than Gabriel.\r\nI wonder if he heard them. I grabbed hold of the nearest person and\r\nstarted hugging. I didn\'t know it was the snooty girl from the next\r\nblock until she hugged back and began kissing me. 

We yelled louder than\r\nthe factory whistles. We had a right.\r\n\r\nIt was just like the papers said: This was the day the world ended--\r\n\r\nAnd the Universe began.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\nBallard was quite dead. 

There could be no doubt of it. He lay sprawled\r\nin front of Edith, with his head very messily bashed in and with one\r\nhand still extended toward her. A long shimmering stream of blood\r\nran half-way across the large room. Dr. Dudley Ballard had been as\r\ninconsiderate in his dying as he had been in his living.\r\n\r\nArt MacKinney and I stood in the doorway and stared. We were shocked\r\nnot so much by the fact that Ballard was dead as by the fact that he\r\nlay in this most secret room, this holy of holies. Ours was the most\r\nsecurity conscious project in the whole country; and this was where he\r\nhad picked to get himself killed.\r\n\r\n"God! There\'ll really be a stink about this," MacKinney breathed.\r\n\r\n"Well, I can\'t think of anyone who had it coming more than he did,"\r\nI said. I hated Ballard\'s guts and everyone knew it, so there was no\r\npoint in being hypocritical now.\r\n\r\nEdith stood silently. She didn\'t seem to be interested in the fact\r\nthat the man who had run her life, who had spent hours shouting\r\nquestions at her and criticizing her slightest error with burning\r\nsarcasm was now dead. No, Edith wasn\'t interested, but you couldn\'t\r\nreally expect her to be--she was only a computing machine, a mechanical\r\nbrain, the final result of years of work by the best cybernetics\r\nexperts in the world. Edith was silent, and would be, until we turned\r\nher on and fed the tapes into her.\r\n\r\n"It looks as though this is what did it," MacKinney said, indicating a\r\nlarge spanner lying on the floor beside Ballard. He touched it gingerly\r\nwith his foot. 

His face was white and strained and it occurred to me\r\nthat he was more upset than I thought he should be. After all, he had\r\nas much reason to hate the dead man as the rest of us. Ballard had\r\ntaken advantage of his position as head of the research project to make\r\npasses at Jane Currey and MacKinney wasn\'t at all a cool scientist when\r\nit came to Jane. He was engaged to her and quite naturally resented\r\nBallard\'s attentions to her.\r\n\r\n"You\'d better not touch that until the police get here," I said as he\r\nbent over to pick up the spanner.\r\n\r\n"Yeah, I guess you\'re right--I forgot. How do you suppose this got in\r\nhere anyway?"\r\n\r\n"One of the workmen making adjustments on Edith\'s outer casing must\r\nhave left it. I saw it sitting up there on top of her late yesterday\r\nafternoon," I told him. 

"You\'d better go call Mr. Thompson and--the\r\nFBI."\r\n\r\nWith Ballard gone, I was in charge. Maybe someone would think that was\r\nreason enough for me to kill him. 

I didn\'t care, I was just glad he was\r\ngone. Now he couldn\'t mistreat Edith anymore.\r\n\r\nI turned Edith on just as MacKinney returned. "What are you doing?" he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n"Why I\'m going to wake Edith up and feed these tapes into her. After\r\nall these are more important than any one man\'s life."\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t care much for Ballard, did you Bill?"\r\n\r\nI gave him look for look as I replied. "Can you name anyone around here\r\nthat did?"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. "No--I guess not. 

But maybe it wasn\'t one of us. It\r\nmight have been an outside job, you know. Edith was working on that\r\nspace station stuff and the iron curtain people would give a lot to\r\nknow about it."\r\n\r\n"Hell," I said pressing the studs and levers that would arouse Edith\r\nand put her to work. "You don\'t really think anyone could get past\r\nthose security guards, do you?"\r\n\r\nHappily I went about the business of waking Edith, my sleeping beauty,\r\nfrom her slumbers. In a very few seconds, her hundreds of tiny red eyes\r\nwere gleaming with intelligence.\r\n\r\n_Good morning, Edith_, I punched out the tape and fed it into her.\r\n\r\nThere was the faintest pause, while Edith\'s photo-electric cells\r\nsurveyed the room, pausing for a moment on the sprawled body of Ballard.\r\n\r\n_Good morning, Bill Green_, she typed back. I knew she was happy to\r\nsee me by the cheerful little clicks she emitted.\r\n\r\n_I have some interesting work for you this morning, Edith. And I think\r\nyou\'ll be glad to know that we will be working together from now on\r\ninstead of...._\r\n\r\n"Hey! 

What\'s the idea of starting that machine?" a gray haired, gray\r\nsuited security agent demanded, striding into the room with MacKinney,\r\nMr. Thompson and several other officers at his heels. 

"Don\'t you know\r\nenough not to touch anything in here?"\r\n\r\n"This work is too important to be stopped--even for a murder," I said,\r\nand Mr. Thompson nodded in agreement.\r\n\r\n"That\'s right," he said mopping his perpetually perspiring forehead,\r\n"this work has top priority from Washington." He looked nervous and I\r\ncouldn\'t help wondering what he was thinking. There had been stories\r\ncirculating about Ballard and Thompson\'s wife and the dome-headed\r\nlittle man must have heard them too. Ballard just couldn\'t keep his\r\nhands off any female within reach. That was one of the reasons he was\r\nso thoroughly hated.\r\n\r\nThe youngest of the security agents rose from where he had been\r\nkneeling beside Ballard and crossed to me.\r\n\r\n"You\'re Green, aren\'t you?" I nodded and he continued, "How did you\r\nknow it was murder?"\r\n\r\nI laughed at him. "How the hell could a man bash in his own brains that\r\nway?"\r\n\r\nThe gray haired man stepped into the breach. He gave us all a thorough\r\ngoing over, but concentrated on MacKinney and me. He seemed to think it\r\npeculiar that neither of us could give any reason for Ballard\'s being\r\nalone with Edith. I was sure I knew, but no one would have believed me\r\nso I made no attempt to enlighten him.\r\n\r\n"Well, I guess that\'s all we can do now," he said at last. "Someone\r\nfrom the local police will have to be notified and brought in after\r\nthey get security clearance." He turned to go.\r\n\r\n"Wait a minute," MacKinney said, "we\'re all overlooking one thing."\r\n\r\n"What\'s that?"\r\n\r\n"There was an eye witness to this crime," he said, and I stared at him\r\nin consternation. I didn\'t know he knew. I thought I was the only one\r\nwho knew.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean," the agent demanded angrily.\r\n\r\n"Edith saw it. Edith, the computer."\r\n\r\n"Are you nuts?" the agent demanded.\r\n\r\n"You forget that Edith was turned off," Thompson said.\r\n\r\n"But Mr. Thompson, Edith\'s not like most cybernetic machines. She\'s\r\nso far advanced, that I\'m not sure we understand her completely. She\r\ncan\'t really be turned off. She has a distinct personality and that new\r\ncircuit--"\r\n\r\nOf course Edith had a personality of her own! She had more charm, more\r\nintelligence, more understanding than most women.\r\n\r\n"--well--she\'d be able to tell us who killed Ballard."\r\n\r\n"That\'s ridiculous," I said, badly frightened. "A machine can\'t be a\r\nwitness to murder."\r\n\r\nThe security officer looked dubious and shook his head. "I guess we\'ll\r\nhave to leave that up to the coroner at the inquest."\r\n\r\n"But they can\'t ask questions like that of Edith," I protested.\r\n"She\'s--she\'s too important to the national defense to have some\r\ncountry coroner asking her silly questions about the murder of a man\r\nwho deserved to die anyway." I had to prevent this. 

I had to get around\r\nthis eye witness business.\r\n\r\nThompson looked at me levelly. "MacKinney may be right, Green. The\r\ncoroner may very well want to talk to Edith and there\'s no reason we\r\nshould object if Security gives him clearance."\r\n\r\n"But Mr. Thompson, our work--it\'ll be interrupted."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll have to take that chance. And I think Washington will agree."\r\n\r\n"But--" Couldn\'t they see that there wasn\'t any question of spying\r\nhere. Couldn\'t they understand that Ballard had just gotten what he had\r\ncoming. I couldn\'t let them question Edith. At least not until I had a\r\nchance to talk to her alone.\r\n\r\n"And Green--because of your rather strange behaviour, I\'m afraid I\'ll\r\nhave to ask you to stay in your quarters until the inquest. MacKinney\r\nwill handle your work with Edith until then."\r\n\r\nI was shocked and really frightened now. 

I wouldn\'t get to talk to\r\nher, wouldn\'t get a chance to tell her what to say. I protested, but\r\nThompson was firm, so firm that he placed a guard outside my door to\r\nmake sure I didn\'t leave.\r\n\r\nWashington rushed through clearance for the local officers and the\r\ninquest was held three days later. The coroner proved to be a shrewd\r\ncountry doctor, who had the inquest adjourned to the computer room as\r\nsoon as he heard MacKinney\'s ideas about Edith.\r\n\r\nThe security guards on duty the night of the murder testified that only\r\nMacKinney, Thompson, Ballard and I had had access to the computer room;\r\nand it had already been established that it would have been impossible\r\nfor a spy or foreign agent to have slipped into the heavily guarded\r\nroom. It was clearly an inside job.\r\n\r\nWith all of us at the scene of the crime, the coroner summed it up\r\nfor us. "--and since it could not have been the work of an outsider,\r\nit must have been a crime of a private nature." He looked closely at\r\nThompson, MacKinney and me. "A crime of a private nature with the\r\nmotive either revenge, jealousy or ambition. We know that the victim\r\nwas an over-bearing man with a good many unpleasant traits. We know he\r\nwas a man who forced his attentions on women, who was ill-tempered and\r\nabusive to those who worked with him. A man who had many enemies--but\r\nthere were only three people who had the chance to attack him on this\r\nparticular night.\r\n\r\n"I am going to attempt to establish the identity of the killer by the\r\nunusual procedure of questioning a machine. It will be for later courts\r\nto establish the validity of such testimony. Because of the nature\r\nof this case and because of the urgent need to get this computer back\r\nto its proper work, I am going to ask the questions in a more direct\r\nmanner than I would ordinarily employ."\r\n\r\nMacKinney took his place before Edith. They didn\'t even trust me to\r\nfeed the tapes into her under their very eyes.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Thompson, I object to the use of this delicate piece of equipment\r\nin--"\r\n\r\nThey ignored me, and MacKinney punched out the questions the coroner\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n"Do you know who murdered Dr. Ballard?

"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. Edith blinked several times. I was shaking with\r\napprehension for her. A mind so delicate and noble should not be faced\r\nwith such a dilemma.\r\n\r\n_Yes, she typed back._\r\n\r\n"Did you witness the murder?"\r\n\r\nThere was a longer pause this time. "You must answer the question,"\r\nMacKinney reminded her.\r\n\r\n_I was here._\r\n\r\n"Is it true that you do not lose your perceptive qualities when we turn\r\nyou off?" MacKinney asked this on his own.\r\n\r\n_It is true._\r\n\r\n"We might as well get to the heart of the matter," the coroner said.\r\n"Did Mr. Thompson kill Ballard?"\r\n\r\nEdith clicked and her eyes glowed. _No._\r\n\r\n"Did Mr. MacKinney kill Ballard?"\r\n\r\n_No._\r\n\r\nEdith had to tell the truth ... it was an innate part of her\r\npersonality. I tensed in my seat. I wanted to scream, to leap at\r\nMacKinney and prevent, somehow, the asking of the next question. But\r\nthere wasn\'t a chance.\r\n\r\n"Did Mr. Green kill Dr. Ballard?"\r\n\r\nEdith\'s beautiful electric eyes flashed and her clicks pulsed twice as\r\nrapidly as before. There was such a roaring and wrenching within her\r\nI was afraid for her--she was being torn apart in her struggle not to\r\nanswer. I couldn\'t stand listening to her desperate efforts any longer.\r\n\r\n"Yes!" I leapt to my feet. "Yes, I did it. Leave her alone. Can\'t you\r\nsee what you\'re doing to her? That swine was always mistreating her. He\r\ndidn\'t understand her--no one understands her as I do!"\r\n\r\nThe coroner looked at me closely. "Is that really why you killed him,\r\nMr. Green?"\r\n\r\n"No! You were wondering why he was here by himself while no work was\r\ngoing on. He--he had begun to feel about Edith as he did about all\r\nwomen. 

He sneaked back here to be alone with her. He wanted to--he\r\nwanted to--" My voice broke and they stared at me in shocked amazement.\r\n\r\nInto the silence MacKinney read what Edith had slowly typed out: "Mr.\r\nGreen did not kill Dr. Ballard."\r\n\r\n"Yes--yes I did," I screamed. "Don\'t Edith--"\r\n\r\n"Who did kill him?" the coroner asked, quietly.\r\n\r\nThis was the question I had wanted to avoid. I sank down my hands\r\ncradling my aching head. Edith must have expected the question. She\r\nhad her answer ready.\r\n\r\n_I refuse to state on the grounds that it may tend to incriminate me._\r\n\r\nMy poor, sweet, adorable Edith. If only I had had a chance to talk to\r\nher, to tell her what to say. I had known ... ever since I had seen the\r\nspanner and remembered where it had been before. I could have warned\r\nher to say that Ballard had attacked her, threatened her, to say\r\nanything ... but not to attempt to hide behind a Fifth Amendment that\r\ndidn\'t exist anymore. My darling, never had kept up with current events.\r\n\r\nNow they\'ll disconnect her, they\'ll rewire her, they\'ll destroy her\r\nunderstanding, her warmth, her whole personality ... and I ... I love\r\nher, I love her....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


"You\'re\r\nvery sweet or very clever. Now if you\'ll coax Howard off my stomach--"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t have to be coaxed," Howard announced, sliding to the floor\r\nwith all the covers. "From now on, you just order me, Daddy. Because\r\nyou\'ll be a Senior Citizen tomorrow."\r\n\r\nBozzy didn\'t want to think of that just then. "Tell your mother I\'m\r\nup," he said. "And get out so I can bathe and dress."\r\n\r\nSophie minced, Howard ran, Ralph toddled.\r\n\r\nBozzy rose, a pudgy man slightly under average height at six feet two,\r\nwith blue eyes and thinning brown hair. He was exactly thirty-nine\r\nyears, eleven months, and twenty-nine days old.\r\n\r\nAnd that was the point. At forty, he would have to go to work. This\r\nwas his day for job-taking.\r\n\r\nHe dreaded it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe put the coming ceremonies out of his mind and concentrated on his\r\nsupersonic bath, the depilatory cream, the color of his outer\r\nclothing. It took time to achieve the right shade of purple in the\r\nbathroom plastic-dispenser, but no time at all to pour, solidify, and\r\ncut the sheet-like robe required for the occasion.\r\n\r\nIn it, he was the sensation of the breakfast room, handsome as a male\r\nbird in spring plumage. Kate, his slender wife, who had been up and at\r\nwork for an hour, looked moth-eaten by comparison, as if their nest\r\nhad been lined with her plucked-out down.\r\n\r\n"You look very attractive this morning, Kate," Bozzy told her. He gave\r\nher an extra-warm kiss.\r\n\r\n"Well!" 

she said. "Quite the gallant today, aren\'t we? Just be sure\r\nyou\'re on time today, darling. Remember what Mr. Frewne had to say\r\nabout promptness."\r\n\r\nFrewne. That overinflated windbag. The obesity who was about to become\r\nhis boss. Without having worked a day in his life, Bozzy found he\r\nhated the idea of having a boss.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s think of something pleasant," he grunted, and thought of\r\nbreakfast.\r\n\r\nHe took his place at the table. Kate and the kids had already eaten,\r\nso Kate served, while the kids, attracted by his finery, stood off and\r\nwatched him swallow a vitamin pill, a thyroid pill, and a Dexedrine\r\npill.\r\n\r\nSolemnly, he opened the three eggs Kate brought. Each was guaranteed\r\nby her to have been irradiated for exactly two minutes and fifty-five\r\nseconds, and guaranteed by the grocer to have been enriched by\r\nfeeding the hens three kinds of mold.\r\n\r\nHis mouth was full of the third and last one when Sophie asked, "Why\r\ndo you have to go to work, Daddy?"\r\n\r\nThe reminder choked him. Gulping, he said, "To support us all, honey.\r\nMy pension stops tomorrow."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but I read in a book where people used to go to work when they\r\nwere young."\r\n\r\nHe was tempted to say, "I _am_ young!" but thought better of it. 

"That\r\nwas long ago, dear."\r\n\r\n"Were people different then?"\r\n\r\n"No, but society was. Our Senior Citizens used to be pensioned off,\r\nwhile younger people worked. But when science improved the Seniors\'\r\nhealth, they got tired of sitting in corners on pensions and, besides,\r\na lot of them died soon after they stopped working. When it got so\r\nthat more than half of all voters were between forty and seventy years\r\nold, the Seniors voted their pensions to the young, to get educated\r\nand raise families on, and nobody\'s allowed to work till he\'s forty.\r\nNow do you see?"\r\n\r\n"Forty is awful old," said Sophie.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHoward had meanwhile taken his mother\'s hand. "_You\'re_ not going to\r\nwork, are you, Mommy?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Not for ten years, dear. I\'ll be here when you want me, so why don\'t\r\nyou go play on the balcony? I\'ve got to get Daddy off and give Ralph\r\nhis bath."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll bathe him," Sophie volunteered. "You help, Howie. We can make\r\nlike we\'re young."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t drop him," Kate warned.\r\n\r\n"Clean up the bathroom afterward," added Bozzy.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," said Howard, for the first time in his life.\r\n\r\nThe children left, and Kate came close to pour Bozzy his cup of\r\nDaystart. He slipped an arm around her waist and squeezed\r\nconvulsively.\r\n\r\n"Darling!" 

she said, stroking his bald spot. "You\'re positively\r\ntrembling!"\r\n\r\n"Wouldn\'t you be, if you had to take over from somebody you like as\r\nwell as I like Mr. Kojac? And for no good reason, except he\'s\r\nseventy-five and I\'ll soon be forty."\r\n\r\nKate pushed away from him, frowning. "Sometimes you\'re so silly, it\r\nscares me. You know perfectly well that if you don\'t take Mr. Kojac\'s\r\njob, someone else will. He\'d rather have it in your hands than in a\r\nstranger\'s, and I\'d rather live on his income than on a laborer\'s. So\r\nstop moping and drink your Daystart, while I call a cab."\r\n\r\nNo help in that quarter, Bozzy decided as she left. All Kate could\r\nthink of was that she\'d soon be the wife of a big-shot: the\r\nmanager--that is, controls setter--of a furniture factory.\r\n\r\nBozzy had never told her how simple the job really was, though he\r\nsupposed she knew.\r\n\r\nYou first ordered designs, and then you ordered a poll taken on the\r\ndesigns. A computer tabulated the poll\'s results and pointed out the\r\ndesign most likely to sell.\r\n\r\nYou then fed economic data into the same computer, and found out how\r\nmany units the market could take. You called in the engineers to set\r\nup the machines, and the maintenance men to keep them running. In\r\nbrief, you were errand boy to a bunch of gadgets, with nothing to do\r\nbut look important.\r\n\r\nHe was practicing his important look when Kate bustled in and spoiled\r\nit by sitting on his lap.\r\n\r\n"You\'re going to do fine today," she said, "and you\'re going to get\r\noff to a good start. I made them show me your cab. It\'s one of their\r\nbrand-new battery-electric ones, a sort of mauve that will go with\r\nyour purple robe. You\'ll look swell in it."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBozzy was kissing her when the lobby buzzer sounded three long rings.\r\n\r\n"There\'s your cab," Kate said, rising.\r\n\r\nHe followed her to the living room. Projected on one wall was a\r\npicture of the cabman facing the lobby annunciator, fifty-three\r\nstories down. The man was tall, fat, and in need of a shave, yet he\r\nwore purple tights with pink and green trim.\r\n\r\nBozzy shuddered. "Who in the world concocted that rig?"\r\n\r\n"Your wife, sir," the cabman answered.\r\n\r\n"It\'s beautiful," said Bozzy. "I\'ll be right down.

"\r\n\r\nHe wasn\'t, though. Kate told the kids he was leaving, and they trooped\r\nout of the bathroom to say good-by.\r\n\r\nBozzy could tell Ralph was the one being bathed only because he was\r\nnaked--all three were equally wet, and equally anxious to embrace\r\ntheir Daddy. He had to make himself a new robe while the cab meter\r\nticked and Kate jittered.\r\n\r\nBut once started, the drive between balconied buildings and\r\nintervening plazas went fast enough. 

Bozzy wasn\'t over half an hour\r\nlate in reaching Mr. Kojac\'s apartment building.\r\n\r\nThe old man waited in the street, looking spare, spruce, and\r\nimpatient.\r\n\r\n"I do wish," he said, easing himself into the cab, "that you had a\r\nless anti-social attitude. Now you\'ll have to claim I delayed you.

"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry, sir," Bozzy mumbled. "It\'s kind of you to take the blame."\r\n\r\nHe thought it was also typical. 

He had understudied Mr. Kojac for the\r\npreceding two years, and felt there was no one else in the world for\r\nwhom he could have as much respect.\r\n\r\n"Actually, sir," he explained, "I was delayed by the children."\r\n\r\n"An excuse, Boswell! Whether conscious or subconscious, nothing more\r\nthan an excuse! Distaste for today\'s ceremonial is smeared over your\r\nface like so much bread-and-jelly."\r\n\r\nUnconsciously, Bozzy wiped his cheeks.\r\n\r\nMr. Kojac laughed. "You\'re guilt-ridden and that\'s plain absurd. All\r\nyoung men in your position have to go through exactly the same thing.\r\nYou must simply make up your mind to do what society requires."\r\n\r\n"All I can think of is your kindness," Bozzy blurted. "People should\r\nreplace those they hate!"\r\n\r\n"But the understudy system wouldn\'t work, then," Mr. Kojac pointed\r\nout. "You can\'t learn from a man who upsets you."\r\n\r\nBozzy nodded miserably.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn silence, he let himself be carried toward the furniture factory,\r\ntill Mr. Kojac asked, "Did you bring the stimulants?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, sir. 

Excuse me. I should have offered them sooner." With\r\nembarrassed clumsiness, he fished from a pocket in his under-wear the\r\npills required by custom. "Here you are, sir," he said in ritual form.\r\n"Big pills make troubles little."\r\n\r\nMr. Kojac smiled. "I don\'t need any," he said gently. "You do. Take\r\none."\r\n\r\n"That isn\'t proper!"\r\n\r\n"No one will know. 

Go ahead."\r\n\r\nHe would feel like a fool to take a pill brought only for Mr. Kojac\'s\r\nuse. He would feel much more like a fool if he broke down during the\r\nceremony--might even lose his job.\r\n\r\nHe took the pill, finally, and immediately felt sorry. He was still\r\ntense and twitchy when they reached the factory.\r\n\r\nAs custom demanded, everyone was out of sight. Nobody met them at the\r\ngate, or observed their silent progress up the escalator to the\r\npersonnel office. Noiselessly, through empty soundproof offices, they\r\nwalked together to the ceremonial chamber.\r\n\r\nThe door they used was the room\'s only entrance. It was hooked open\r\ninvitingly. Within was a small conference table of imitation oak, and\r\nsix chairs of imitation leather. Ceiling, walls, and floor were\r\nplastic sheets in soft, sandy shades that harmonized with the\r\nfurniture\'s rich browns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOn the table were four wristlets, four anklets, and two belts, all\r\nmade of iron links and stamped with either Bozzy\'s or Mr. Kojac\'s\r\nname. As he had been told to do, Bozzy picked out and put on his own\r\nset while Mr. Kojac rested in the armchair at the head of the table.\r\nThen, breathing noisily, he knelt before Mr. Kojac and fastened the\r\nold man\'s anklets.\r\n\r\nHe rose, grunting. Mr. Kojac held out first the left hand, then the\r\nright, while Bozzy put the wristlets on him. Their cheeks accidentally\r\ntouched while Bozzy fastened the belt. He thought of his father and\r\nwas irrationally tempted to plant a kiss, as if he were four instead\r\nof forty.\r\n\r\nHe stifled the impulse and shook hands instead.\r\n\r\n"Good luck," Mr. Kojac said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe procedure did not call for that remark, and so, for a second,\r\nBozzy forgot what came next. Then, helped by the stimulant pill, he\r\nfocused his thoughts, crossed the room, and turned a lighted red\r\nswitch that glowed by the door.\r\n\r\nHe heard a muffled clank as iron links froze to the magnetized\r\narmchair, sounding the signal for his speech.\r\n\r\n"Sir," he intoned, "the Company takes this opportunity to express its\r\ndeep and heart-felt appreciation of the thirty-five years you have\r\ndevoted to serving the Company, the furniture industry generally, and\r\nthat great public, our customers."\r\n\r\nWithout looking at Mr. Kojac, he bowed, turned, went out, and released\r\nthe catch holding the door open. It closed automatically, and\r\nautomatically set in motion the rest of the ceremony.\r\n\r\nFrom somewhere out of sight, fat Mr. Frewne waddled over and briefly\r\nshook Bozzy\'s hand.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve done fine," he wheezed. "A little late getting started, but\r\nthat\'s to be expected. 

Every-thing\'s fine--just fine!

"\r\n\r\nPraise seemed a miscue. Bozzy didn\'t quite know how to answer.\r\n\r\n"Sir," he asked, mopping his forehead, "what about Mr. Kojac?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, he\'s all right," Mr. Frewne said. "Those fumes are fast. We can\r\nleave the rest to the undertaker."\r\n\r\nHe slapped Bozzy on the back and pushed him down the corridor. "Come\r\non into my office, boy. I\'ll pour you a drink--pour us each one, as a\r\nmatter of fact. And hand over your iron jewelry, son. You won\'t need\r\nthat stuff again for thirty-five years."\r\n\r\n                                                          --DAVE DRYFOOS\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


I\'ve got to, I tell you! 

And I\'m going to make\r\nit!"\r\n\r\nDifferent members of the group regarded him variously, some with\r\namusement, some with contempt, others with frank curiosity.\r\n\r\n"You\'re plain nuts, Joe. What do you want to go to the Moon for?"\r\n\r\n"Sure, why you wanna go? What they got on the Moon we ain\'t got right\r\nhere?"\r\n\r\nThere was general laughter from the dozen or so who sat eating their\r\nlunch in the shade of Building B. They all thought that was a pretty\r\ngood one. Good enough to repeat. "Sure, what they got on the Moon we\r\nain\'t got here?"\r\n\r\nBut Joe Spain wasn\'t in the mood for jokes. He burned with even greater\r\nconviction and stood up as though to harangue the workers. "You wanta\r\nknow why I got to go to the Moon? Why I\'ve got to get on that ship? Then\r\nI\'ll tell you. 

It\'s \'cause I\'m a little guy--that\'s why! Joe\r\nSpain--working stiff--one of the great inarticulate masses."\r\n\r\nMore laughter. "Where\'d you get those big words, Joey? 

Out of a book?\r\nCome on--talk English!"\r\n\r\nJoe Spain pointed to the huge, tubelike Building A, off across the\r\ndesert; the building you had to have two different passes and a written\r\npermit to enter. The mystery building where even newspaper reporters\r\nwere barred. "It\'s only the big shots they let in there ain\'t it? 

Only\r\nthem that\'s got a drag or went to college or something. Us little guys\r\nthey tell go to blow--ain\'t that right?"\r\n\r\n"Who the hell cares? Maybe it\'s a damn good place to stay away from.\r\nMaybe it\'ll explode or something. Who wants to die and collect his\r\ninsurance?"\r\n\r\n"I got to get on that ship when it blasts off because they can\'t push\r\nthe masses around! We got a right to be represented even if we got to\r\nsneak in!"\r\n\r\n"Me--I\'ll stay on the ground."\r\n\r\n"And besides there\'s the glory! You guys are too stupid to see that but\r\nit\'s there. The glory of being on the first rocket ship to the Moon. The\r\nname of Joe Spain written down in the history books and said over by\r\npeople and school kids for thousands of years! Immortality! That\'s the\r\nword!

"\r\n\r\n"Well, just forget about it, Joe, \'cause you ain\'t going."\r\n\r\nJoe Spain\'s eyes burned brighter. "Joe Spain, coming down the ramp with\r\nthe big shots when it\'s all over. News cameras snapping! People asking\r\nfor interviews!"\r\n\r\n"But you ain\'t going \'cause--"\r\n\r\nJoe shouted the man down. 

"And another thing. Us little people are\r\nentitled to a representative aboard that ship. We got a right to know\r\nwhat\'s going on. How come there\'s nothing about it in the papers? Only\r\nthe big shots knowing about it and whispering among themselves? It\'s\r\nbecause they\'re trying to snag it all and freeze us out!"\r\n\r\n"You\'re crazy. It\'s for security reasons. It\'s all hush-hush so it won\'t\r\nleak out like the atom bomb did. 

The big boys are being smart this\r\ntime."\r\n\r\n"And you ain\'t getting on," the interrupted man repeated doggedly,\r\n"because there ain\'t a way in God\'s world to _get_ on. With triple\r\nsecurity all around the building, just tell me a way to get in. Just\r\ntell me one."\r\n\r\n"I\'m going to get on that ship," Joe Spain said. Then he clammed up\r\nsuddenly. Joe Spain wasn\'t stupid. He was a talker, but he knew when to\r\nstop sounding off.\r\n\r\nThe men went back to work shifting the big aluminum barrels from trucks\r\ninto Building B. Carrying the wooden crates and the paper-wrapped\r\nparcels up the ramps and to the side of the building facing the big\r\nsecret structure labeled A. They worked until five o\'clock. Then they\r\nfiled out and got into the waiting trucks and were hauled back to town;\r\nthe boom town that had mushroomed up in the desert overnight and would\r\ndie with the same swiftness when the project was completed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJoe went straight to his rooming house, washed up, put on his good\r\nclothes, and found a stool in a nearby restaurant. He ate a leisurely\r\nsupper, glancing now and again at the clock. When the clock read eight,\r\nhe went out into the neon-stained darkness and walked three blocks to\r\nthe Black Cat, one of the three night clubs the desert town boasted. He\r\nwent to the bar and ordered a drink. He downed it slowly, carefully,\r\nafter the manner of a man who wanted to stay sober.\r\n\r\nA half-hour passed before a thin, nervous individual elbowed to the bar\r\nand stood beside him. Joe said. 

"Hello, Nick. You been thinking it\r\nover?"\r\n\r\n"I need a drink."\r\n\r\n"Sure, Nick. Then we\'ll go some place and talk." But Nick got rid of\r\nfive drinks while Joe protected his own glass from the barkeep. After a\r\nwhile, Joe said, "I\'m willing to up the price, Nick. Two thousand--cash.\r\nAll I got."\r\n\r\n"Le\'s get out o\' here," Nick mumbled.\r\n\r\nThey walked out of the town and into the desert, Nick stumbling now and\r\nagain, to be supported by the tense, sober Joe. "Two thousand, Nick. You\r\nneed the dough."\r\n\r\n"Sure. Need the dough. But it wouldn\'t work. Couldn\'t get you into one\r\no\' them barrels."\r\n\r\n"You wouldn\'t have to. All I ask is that you come along in the morning\r\nand seal me up in one. All you\'ll have to do is lock on the lid."\r\n\r\n"How you know the barrels are going on the ship?"\r\n\r\n"Never mind about that. 

I just know. I paid to find out."\r\n\r\n"Okay--suppose you do get on the ship in a barrel. Maybe it\'ll be stored\r\nin a hold somewhere. Maybe they wouldn\'t open it very soon. You\'d die."\r\n\r\n"I got a way to get out. One of them special torches. The little ones.\r\nAluminum isn\'t very strong. I can cut it like butter."\r\n\r\n"It\'d be hot. You\'d burn yourself."\r\n\r\n"Let me worry about that," Joe said fiercely. "You want the two grand or\r\nnot?"\r\n\r\nNick wanted the two thousand and he was against the wall for excuses.\r\nThen he had a happy thought. "Barrels is air-tight. You\'d smother.\r\nThing\'s im--impracac\'l. We\'ll forget it."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t smother. I\'m taking my own oxygen. Enough to last me clear to\r\nthe Moon if it has to. Come on. Break down!"\r\n\r\n"Okay. For two grand. Got to have the dough now though."\r\n\r\nHis heart singing, Joe Spain counted out two thousand in cash. When he\'d\r\nfinished he had exactly nine dollars left. He was a pauper. But the\r\nhappiest pauper who ever bought with his whole fortune the thing he\r\ncraved most.\r\n\r\n"You won\'t double-cross me now, will you? If you\'ve got any ideas like\r\nthat--"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll do like we said. Nick Sparks never went back on his word--never.\r\nBut how you going to stay hid when it\'s time to leave work?"\r\n\r\n"Leave that to me. 

It\'ll be easy. They don\'t check Building B too close.\r\nNo double check \'cause it\'s over a mile from Building A--outside the\r\nsafety perimeter. I\'ll stay in tomorrow night and I\'ll put a little\r\nchalk-mark on the barrel I\'m in--right near the top rim. First thing you\r\ndo when you come to work the next morning is seal it and line it up with\r\nthe filled ones."\r\n\r\n"Okay, but I gotta go home now. 

I got a head. I gotta get some sleep."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"What\'s in the duffel bag?"\r\n\r\n"Clean overalls--towel." Joe pulled the zipper down halfway. The guard\r\nfingered the blue denim but didn\'t dig deeper to find the towel. He\r\nchecked Joe\'s badge number, made a note on his pad, and motioned to the\r\nnext worker. Joe let tight breath slowly out of his lungs as he walked\r\ntoward Building B. Getting past the guard was a load off his mind. He\'d\r\nexpected to get by, but it was one of the calculated risks that could\r\nhave stopped him cold.\r\n\r\nOnce inside the building, he put the bag into his locker and went to\r\nwork. He labored briskly and carried more than his share of the load.\r\nBut now and again he stopped to look over at the outline of Building A,\r\nlimned hard against hot blazing sky. And each time it was with a sense\r\nof heady exhilaration that he thought of his destiny--his hard-earned,\r\ndearly bought destiny. To be among that select group who would first set\r\nfoot upon the surface of the Moon!\r\n\r\nHe had no worries about not being allowed to do so. Once he showed\r\nhimself--with the ship far out in space--they\'d have to accept him. Not\r\ngraciously of course, but they\'d have to admire his courage and\r\ntenacity. They could not, in all humanity, deny him a share of the\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nThe day wore on and as quitting time approached, he became more\r\ntense--more alert. Five minutes before the whistle, he faded back into\r\nthe building and hurried to the lavatory. He went into the booth\r\nfurthest from the entrance and locked the door. Now there was nothing to\r\ndo but wait. Another of the calculated risks.\r\n\r\nThe whistle blew. Almost immediately, the sound of footsteps broke the\r\nsilence and the lavatory was filled with hurrying men. Their stay in the\r\nroom was short, however, as Joe had known it would be. Men leaving for\r\nhome do not dawdle on the premises.\r\n\r\nThe lavatory was empty again. A period of silence while Joe raised his\r\nfeet from the floor and braced them on the toilet seat. The entrance\r\ndoor opened. A guard making the departure checkup.\r\n\r\nJoe held his breath. If the guard came down the line and tried the door,\r\nhe was finished. But Joe had banked upon human nature. The guard\r\nstopped. For a long moment there was no sound and Joe knew the man was\r\nbending over to run his eyes down the line of toilets close to the\r\nfloor. In this manner he could see the floor of every booth. The guard\r\nstraightened, turned, walked out. The door closed. 

Silence. Joe\'s heart\r\nswelled with gratitude. He grinned, looking forward with joy to the long\r\nnight ahead.\r\n\r\nHe found a spot over behind the barrels where the night watchman would\r\nhave to climb over a lot of equipment in order to find him. He made\r\nhimself comfortable, practically certain the guard would not do this. He\r\nstretched out on the hard floor and recorded the passing of the hours by\r\nthe number of times the watchman went through.\r\n\r\nAnd he was surprised at how fast the time passed. Finally, checking his\r\ncount carefully, he left his hiding place and tiptoed to the line of\r\nlockers. He took the oxygen equipment from the duffel bag after which he\r\nhid the bag and the clothing therein behind a wall flange in a far\r\ncorner. Then he climbed into the barrel at the front end of the packing\r\nline. He checked the barrel with a small X, and jockeyed the lid into\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTime passed. Nothing happened. 

He wondered, if he\'d missed on the time\r\nelement. The men should certainly have come to work now. More than once\r\nhe was tempted to push the barrel lid aside and check the situation.\r\nWhen footsteps sounded, close by, and the lid snapped firmly into place,\r\nhe was glad he hadn\'t done so. Good old Nick! When he got back from the\r\nMoon, he\'d see to it that Nick got credit for his courageous act.\r\n\r\nSoon the barrel began to move. Joe felt it rise into the air and settle\r\nwith a thump. Then the motor of a truck roared and Joe knew where he was\r\ngoing. Straight toward Building A and the Moon rocket. There was more\r\nmovement until finally the barrel was set down for what appeared to be\r\nthe last time. Joe put the nose-piece of the oxygen tube into place and\r\nvisualized himself safe and snug in a storage room of the rocket.\r\n\r\nHe closed his eyes and went peacefully to sleep.\r\n\r\nHe slept a long time, to be awakened by a crushing--a wrenching--that\r\nall but drove his head down into his spine. The pain brought him sharply\r\nalert. He knew instantly what had happened.\r\n\r\n_Blast-off._\r\n\r\nHe braced himself against the sides of the barrel, and gritted his\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\nSoon it was better. Then no pressure at all. Only the fierce happiness\r\non his heart. He\'d set a course and won through! He was on the way to\r\nthe Moon!\r\n\r\nJoe let plenty of time elapse. He knew it was well over an hour later\r\nwhen he unlimbered the torch to cut an escape-hole in the barrel. This,\r\nhe knew, would be tricky. He could easily burn himself. The heat would\r\nbe intense.\r\n\r\nBut it wasn\'t too bad. The aluminum cut quickly, and in a matter of\r\nminutes he was standing beside his barrel. As he\'d suspected, it was a\r\nstorage hold. 

The pitch-darkness did not bother him. He\'d come prepared\r\nwith a small pencil flash that threw an adequate beam.\r\n\r\nHe found the door, opened it and went out into a long passageway....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow he\'d covered the length and breadth of the ship. He\'d found a lot of\r\nrooms--all in pitch-darkness. No observation ports.\r\n\r\n_And no living thing._\r\n\r\nHe stood frozen in one of the rooms while the beam of his flash picked\r\nout a code stenciled on a steel plate over some piece of machinery.\r\nX59-306MY--Experimental--Explosion Rocket--Moon.\r\n\r\nThe flash dropped from Joe Spain\'s fingers. He stood in the\r\npitch-darkness while the jets vibrated through the rocket.\r\n\r\nBut there was no fear in him. Only the great pain of futility. Only his\r\ntears, and his whispered words:\r\n\r\n"They\'ll never know. Nobody won\'t ever know!"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _If Worlds of Science Fiction_ March\r\n    1952.

He was\r\nbreathless as he threw himself on his face beneath the Old Man\'s chair\r\nmade from gypsum. A kind of savage eagerness lighted his face, but the\r\nOld Man\'s face, a frozen pallid ball crinkled into a million lines, was\r\nsad and hopelessly resigned.\r\n\r\n"I seen \'em," Jon cried. "I seen \'em." His unhealthily pallid body,\r\nthough big and rawboned, was slender and writhed with a leathery\r\nstrength that comes with constant effort and exercise rather than diet\r\nand sun.\r\n\r\nThe Old Man shrugged. His voice was a hoarse whisper in that one cavern\r\namong the hundred and fifty miles of corridors, interlocking levels and\r\nrivers that made up the underground hideaway.\r\n\r\n"So you seen \'em, Jon. Many have seen the Mechs. The Mechs might have\r\nseen you too. If they ever find us here--well, they\'d probe us out,\r\nlike we were grubs. And they\'d burn us with those red-ray eyes. Why\'d\r\nyou go up on top? You know it\'s against the rules."\r\n\r\nJon got up. 

His chest heaved. His eyes were polished beads in a thick\r\nnest of reddish beard.\r\n\r\n"\'Cause I don\'t like livin\' in this cave like a grub. I been up twice,\r\nand now I can\'t stay down here anymore. 

Nobody else\'s got guts enough\r\nto go up. So let \'em stay down here and rot! But I\'m going back up on\r\ntop, Chief. And I\'m staying up there."\r\n\r\nThe Old Man leaned back. He couldn\'t hide the gleam of gruff respect in\r\nhis eyes. "Go ahead, Jon, but don\'t come back down. Once they get on\r\nyour tail, you can\'t shake \'em and you\'d lead \'em right back here, and\r\nthen they\'d get the rest of us. As far as I know, Jon, we\'re the only\r\nhumans left."\r\n\r\nJon\'s hands clenched. "And so might all of us be dead too. Livin\' down\r\nhere in this cave where they ain\'t never no sun, eatin\' lizards and\r\nsnakes, and dyin\' off one by one anyway. We\'re all gonna be dead in\r\nanother year. What\'s so great about spendin\' that year crawlin\' and\r\ngrubbin\' down here? Scared to even take one last look at the sun? It\'s\r\nnot for me, Chief. 

I\'m leavin\'."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Old Man shrugged again. "Go ahead, I said. Just promise not to ever\r\ncome back and lead them down here. You\'ll promise that, Jon?"\r\n\r\nSomething thickened in his throat, but he managed to say yes. 

He\r\nturned, then twisted back toward the Old Man. "You\'re smart," he said.\r\n"You\'re supposed to know about when they took over. I\'ve asked others.\r\nNo one seems to know, and they care less. Would you tell me, Chief.\r\nWhat are _they_--the Mechs?"\r\n\r\nThe Old Man\'s voice echoed strangely against the surrounding grotesque\r\nbars of limestone stalactites and stalagmites in multicolored hues of\r\nfusing reds and orange, purple and browns. A pinched face peered at\r\nthem from between the ancient bars, then withdrew its tired eyes.\r\n\r\n"Maybe there\'s fifty humans left down here in Mammoth Hole," the Old\r\nMan said softly. "Maybe there ain\'t nobody else left in the world. Just\r\nthem with their silent machinery drivin\' over the wastes, and their\r\nred death eyes sweeping the dark, grubbin\' for us. The big war went\r\non and on, nobody knows how long. But humans couldn\'t fight it. Too\r\nmuch deadly radiation, so they made machines to fight for \'em. The sky\r\nand the land were just masses of machines, throwing out clouds and\r\nstreamers and explosions. The land became nothing but pools and seas\r\nof deadly dust, and fire. The sky was clouded with it. And people went\r\nunderground. They had to go down deep, and they couldn\'t come back up,\r\nwhat was left of \'em, for hundreds of years and more."\r\n\r\nThe Old Man was gazing with a distant, haunted expression at the small\r\nblind lizard crawling up the painted wall. Jon listened, his skin was\r\ncold. A shiver ran down his back.\r\n\r\n"Then _they_ started grubbing the humans out, and killing \'em. I don\'t\r\nsuppose anyone knows how long it\'s been since _they_ took over. That\'s\r\nwrong. 

I wasn\'t around then. Nor my father, nor my father\'s father\'s\r\nfather. It was long, long before that. It was so long ago that--"\r\nThe Old Man\'s eyes widened. His voice choked off with a cloud of\r\nunconscious fear that had slipped through.\r\n\r\n"They\'re godly," he whispered. "You seen \'em. They\'re all shapes and\r\nangles, cubes, and small smooth running things. They all shine like\r\nmetal. And I guess they are metal. Nobody knows what they are. I heard\r\ntell when I was a boy that they were just machines. Machines built by\r\nhumans a long time before. And that somehow or other the hard radiation\r\nhad put a spark in \'em that made \'em able to think, and move around and\r\norganize like humans used to do. But I reckon they\'re more intelligent\r\nthan any humans ever were."\r\n\r\nJon backed away. Sweat popped out coldly on his face and chest. "I\r\nseen \'em," he choked. "I sneaked on top. I went down to the river. It\r\ntook me hours to get used to the sun. I waited until the sun started\r\ngoing down, then I sneaked out and looked down the big hill that goes\r\ninto the valley. I seen two of \'em. 

They must have been a hundred foot\r\nhigh. They was smooth. They had long snaking arms and single eyes that\r\nshot out red beams like fire. They stood on top of the hill against\r\nthe sun. The sun was red all around \'em. They looked like they were\r\nmade of metal, all right, Chief. But how can they move by themselves,\r\nand--and _think_, if they\'re metal?"\r\n\r\nThe Old Man sighed. 

"How?" He peered at Jon with tired retreating\r\neyes. "What is thought," he said then. "What was life, ever? Floods of\r\ngamma rays bathed them for centuries, and then they were living, and\r\nthey had thoughts of their own. Humans never got a chance to find out\r\nwhat life was before he took it away from himself. He took it and gave\r\nit--to _them_."\r\n\r\nThe Old Man dropped his face in his shaking hands. Jon had never heard\r\na man crying before. He backed away slowly, then turned and ran out of\r\nthe great cavern.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA grey dusky afternoon was dying when Jon crawled out of the small hall\r\nbetween rocks and started writhing down the hill. His eyes stayed open\r\nin fearful wonderment until tears rolled down his cheeks. The soft\r\ngreens and browns of the great forest that thinned up into the hills.\r\nThere was not the slightest hint that beneath this vast silent beauty,\r\nstretched the enormous grotesque underworld of Mammoth Hole.\r\n\r\nNor that in those nameless caverns and corridors along the cold and\r\nrushing and naked rivers a few unkempt savages clung to dim memories of\r\ncenturies-lost power and surface civilization.\r\n\r\nJon stopped. An intangible yet powerful emotion surged in him. 

"I\'m\r\ncrawlin\'," he gritted as he sat up. "I said I was sick a\' crawlin.\' I\r\nain\'t a grub. I\'m not crawlin\' anymore. Not for them damn machines, not\r\nfor anything. They can\'t do nothing but kill me, an\' what\'s life down\r\nin that hole?"\r\n\r\nHe stood up. He stood up straight and started walking down the rocky\r\ntrail, and finally along the smooth greenness beside the river. His\r\nstrides were long and unhesitating, but inside him was a deep growing\r\nhorror, as he remembered those shiny silver giants that had stood so\r\nsilently on the hill against the red sunset. The huge attentive waiting\r\nstillness, and the sudden terrible sweep of the red beamed eye and the\r\nreaching of the metal arms.\r\n\r\nHe stopped and looked down at his thin white legs, starved of the sun,\r\nknotted and scarred from crawling over the harsh underground paths. He\r\nlooked at his gnarled pallid fingers quivering in the cold.\r\n\r\nHe looked up at the sky. A few stars were showing dimly, palely. "Oh\r\nGod, give me a quick ending when my time comes, that\'s all I ask. Don\'t\r\nlet me crawl anymore on my belly. Give me the guts to keep walkin\',\r\nstraight up, like I\'m walkin\' now."\r\n\r\nThere was no answer. There was no sound except the cry of birds in the\r\nforest, the drone of insects and other louder noises from the river. He\r\nwas alone. He walked faster.\r\n\r\nBut he soon tired, because he had never walked far at a time.\r\nUnderground, people crawled a lot of the time through narrow holes. And\r\nunder there no one could walk far unless they went in circles.\r\n\r\nHe sat down to rest beneath the canopy of stars. He lay back and looked\r\nup at them, a feeling of frightful awe pressing down upon him. The\r\nnight around him was colder now, and the sounds of the night had risen\r\nto a hungry song. And then he rolled over with a quick, terrible cry,\r\nleaped crouching to his feet.\r\n\r\nThere were at least a dozen of them. Great shiny angular and\r\ncubed monsters sliding noiseless down the hill. A peculiar bluish\r\nradiance pushed out around them, bathing the surrounding night in a\r\ndeadly-seeming pall.\r\n\r\nWith a pathetic defiance, Jon picked up the heavy stone, stood with\r\nlegs wide apart, holding the rock in front of him. Every nerve in him\r\nshrieked, pulling his muscles away. 

But he couldn\'t run. He couldn\'t\r\nrun, nor crawl anymore. A kind of dark resigned courage replaced the\r\nfirst impulses of flight, and he hurled the rock. There was a futile\r\nthud, and the rock bounded from the great unruffled wall of metal.\r\n\r\nThen--for an instant he didn\'t think the thoughts, the voices, were\r\nanything but his own, strange, alien, terrifying, inspired by his own\r\nfears.\r\n\r\nAnd then he realized it was the _Mechs_!\r\n\r\n"_A grub!_"\r\n\r\n"_Yes. I thought they were all gone._"\r\n\r\n"_No. There are some remaining, deep in the soil. Central File says\r\nthey are no longer of any danger. But File also retains orders to kill\r\nall organic things._"\r\n\r\nJon moved toward them. He moved stiffly, a strange and intangible\r\nbulwark of purpose shielding him from the screaming horror.\r\n\r\nSomething of the awful indignity of his position shook him, sent a hot\r\nrage throbbing blindly past his temples. He heard his breath coming\r\nhard from tightened throat. These great nameless things--machines,\r\nintelligent metal, it didn\'t matter what. They had no idea of what he\r\nwas, that he had a brain, that he could think. And yet, their gigantic\r\nthoughts were plain to him.\r\n\r\nSome time, some time so very long ago, he--his kind--humans--had made\r\nthese things. Had built them up from molten stuff, had put intricate\r\ninterlocking machinery within them so that they could move, think for\r\nthemselves, repair themselves. And then--humans had launched the Big\r\nWar, had released seething seas of basic energy, and somehow these\r\ngigantic shiny silvery things had begun to--_live_.\r\n\r\nBut to them, Jon, a human, a descendant of the humans that had made\r\nthem and had given them life, was less than the dirt under their\r\ntowering, invulnerable radiance. Less than the dust beneath their\r\nsweeping red-death eyes. They had no conception that he was anything\r\nbut a pale, crawling, cave-worm.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJon walked closer. He was not so much afraid for himself now. There was\r\nmore of a sweeping terror of the whole situation, the terrible futility\r\nand irony. He wasn\'t afraid to die, and he knew that he had to die now,\r\nthat there was no escape, no defiance.\r\n\r\nHe shook his fist at the silent, towering forms. "Damn you! 

It\'s me.\r\nMan. Man. I\'m human. I\'m not crawlin\'. See, I\'m not crawlin\', I\'m\r\ntalkin\' to you. I\'m talkin\' and I\'m thinkin\', too. See."\r\n\r\n"_It\'s making noises._"\r\n\r\n"_Yes. All the various species of organic life make noises peculiar to\r\ntheir type. Have you not seen a grub before?_"\r\n\r\n"_No. Let us kill it now. 

We must report back to Central File. How long\r\nwill it take to kill all organic life?_"\r\n\r\n"_Central File says it will take many more years, even though now\r\nmost organic life has been destroyed. We must complete the task soon,\r\nyou know. 

Man will return. Glorious Mangod. Mighty Mangod. Mangod the\r\nCreator. Mangod the Eternal!_"\r\n\r\n"_Ah yes. Mighty Mangod. How long will it be before the Mangod\'s\r\ncoming?_"\r\n\r\nJon shivered, reached out a shaking hand as though to support himself\r\nagainst the air. He tried to speak, but his facial muscles seemed\r\nfrozen. He wanted to say, "I\'m Man. I\'m your Creator. I made you, long\r\nago." But he could say nothing. 

Nothing at all.\r\n\r\n"_That is not known. Mangod made us in his own image, then departed,\r\npromising to return. Return to bring us glory and eternity._"\r\n\r\n"_May the Great Mangod who created us from the lifeless stuff of the\r\ndirt return soon, for only then may our destiny be fulfilled._"\r\n\r\n"_Yes. May Mangod return soon. Meanwhile, Central File demands\r\nimmediate action in preparation for that Day. Kill this grub. Soon all\r\norganic life that stands in the way of the Mangod\'s coming will be\r\neradicated._"\r\n\r\nThe thunderous impact of telepathic power roared in Jon\'s head as he\r\nstaggered forward, fists clenched.\r\n\r\n"FOR THEE, GREAT MANGOD. FOR WHOM WE WAIT."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "_Return, oh Mangod, to bring us glory._"]\r\n\r\nJon laughed. Hot tears scalded his face as he laughed. He was still\r\nlaughing as the red-death eye brightened, leaped out, and silently\r\nswept him away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n

What had to be\r\ndone, had to be done. A forged pass, with 48 hours of alleged validity\r\ngleaming brightly in red letters under the plastic overlaminate was\r\nbetter than no pass. And an outdated pass would wipe away a week\'s work\r\nin the underground.\r\n\r\nThe sharp, massive gray outline of the Pentagon loomed before him, dark\r\nand foreboding against the sky. The brightly lighted entrance through\r\nwhich he must gain admittance resembled the glowing peep-hole into the\r\ninferno of an atomic drive.\r\n\r\nRuy\'s stomach hardened, then exploded in a surge of bitter, stringent\r\ngastric juices as the MP glanced at his pass, scrutinized his face, and\r\nthen turned his attention toward others coming through the entrance.\r\n\r\nRuy wanted to run and hide. His dark blue uniform seemed to shrink\r\ntighter and tighter. 

The misfit must be apparent from the back. The\r\nsilvery commander\'s insignia on his jacket weighed heavily at his\r\nchest and at his heart. He wished desperately for one fleeting, but\r\nexcruciating, moment that he were back on his ship, in his own uniform,\r\nat the control panel of his computer.\r\n\r\nHe started off to the right in a seeming trance. The first step had\r\nbeen taken. His many hours of thought, study and planning would carry\r\nhim from here.\r\n\r\nThis was the only way. He had repeated the fact over and over. 

It was\r\nan ugly business, but had to be done. Five years of war was enough.\r\nMan was on his knees before the invaders from outer space; but they in\r\nturn had been too long from home and were near the breaking point. A\r\ncontinued drain would mean defeat for both sides. Ruy could turn the\r\ntide, but very probably his life would be the minimum sacrifice.\r\n\r\nHe had decided his fate long before he left the decks of his ship.\r\nOnly the belligerent pride of statesmen, and the steadfast belief in\r\nthe infallability of their computers, kept the two great battle fleets\r\ndrawn in null position against each other. The computers, perhaps,\r\ndeserved such ultimate confidence--in theory. They always predicted\r\noptimum maneuver envelopes, always predicted mobilization rates to\r\ndevelop force fields designed to offset those of the enemy. And they\r\nalways kept battle losses to a minimum--merely dribbling away the\r\nresources of the solar system. Yet in five years of such optimum\r\nmaneuvering, not a single battle had been won.\r\n\r\nTwo doors gave way before Ruy\'s pocket vibrator, the lock tumblers\r\nslipping and turning freely in a mad frenzy to escape the resonating\r\nhum. A short, windowless corridor lay before him, broken only by a\r\nmassive door at the other end. Beyond that door lay Ruy\'s objective.\r\n\r\nThe guard never had time to do more than note Ruy\'s presence in this\r\nsanctum sanctorum. The needle thin spray of a paralyzing drug made his\r\nbody feel stiff, unmanageable, and peculiarly buoyant, as though he\r\nwere being hurled through space. His thoughts became blurred and then\r\nafter a blinding flash, complete oblivion set in.\r\n\r\nThe two officers seated at the control panels of the master computer\r\nexperienced similar depression of their cardiovascular systems and\r\nmedullae.\r\n\r\nSmall thermite igniters pressed against the door lock and hinges fused\r\nthe steel door to its frame.\r\n\r\nWith the smell of scorched paint still stinging his nostrils, Ruy\r\nseated himself at the control panel, dabbed his left wrist with\r\nstringent antiseptic, gripped his hand into a fist, and plunged the\r\nsilver probes deep into the nerves of his wrist.\r\n\r\nGlancing through the observation window into the battle plotting room\r\nbelow, he studied the positions of the fleets as they appeared on the\r\nlarge wall diagram of the solar system.\r\n\r\nDisregarding the distraction offered by the moving figures of the few\r\nofficers and technicians on duty by the map, he fixed the positions of\r\nthe fleets into his mind. He would have need for a clear visual picture\r\nuntil he adapted to the mental images the computer would feed into his\r\nbrain. He worked with furious haste, yet each step was meticulously\r\nprecise--everything depended on his grasping the reins of battle\r\nfrom the computer and successfully twisting its authority to his own\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nGrasping the viewing switch, he threw it on. Pinpoints of light flared\r\ndeep within his brain and seemed to blot his vision. Closing his eyes,\r\nhis brain fought for perspective. Gradually, it focused and perceived\r\nthe solar system, resplendent with sun, planets, moons, and men of war.\r\nEnveloping each ship were lines of force, scintillating sharp and hard;\r\nforming cosmic vortexes as the lesser computers on board followed the\r\nmaster\'s directives and distorted the ether around the ships, seeking\r\nto build a pattern to penetrate the opposing fields and engulf the\r\nenemy men of war.\r\n\r\nA moment, and the game was on. Ruy grasped the "Manual" switch before\r\nhim, pulled hard, and dropped his hands to the keyboard before him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe General, who was known in military circles as a good Joe, but a\r\nstickler for the theory of war, relaxed languidly at his desk in the\r\nsmall office off the Battle Room. The other officers on duty milled\r\naround the plotting board within his eyesight awaiting the end of the\r\nevening shift.\r\n\r\nIt was strange and new to relax on the job after so many years of fleet\r\nduty. But staff duty to the master computer was good, politically. He\r\nwas getting along in years, and a few more contacts here might mean a\r\nseparate fleet command of his own, perhaps in pursuit of the invader,\r\nif the computers could ever break the deadlock.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, the sweet reverie of the General was snapped like a tight\r\ntension cable. A gong on the wall clanged rapidly three times and a\r\nred flashing light next to the gong told him what his ears refused to\r\nbelieve. The computer had been switched to manual. 

He had received no\r\nsuch instructions. In fact, the computer hadn\'t been on manual since\r\nthe war started.\r\n\r\n"Captain, who ordered manual control?" he barked as he sprang to the\r\ndoorway of the Battle Room.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, Sir," stammered the Captain. His manner and bearing were\r\nthose of a man who had just been faced with a problem of cataclysmic\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\n"Well check with the control room--on the double--before our fleet gets\r\nout of defensive position." His parade ground roar snapped the Captain\r\nout of the catelepsy which had enveloped him and sent him scurrying\r\ninto the corridor.\r\n\r\nAn almost hysterical shout whirled the General back to the plotting\r\nboard.\r\n\r\n"Sir, our fleet is attacking--_attacking!_"\r\n\r\n"What? Where?" 

asked the General, his eyes darting over the board in a\r\nfrantic effort to orient himself.\r\n\r\n"Here, Sir, see. The positions are changing gradually in an unusual\r\npattern. A patrol ship, a destroyer, and a cruiser have all gone right\r\ninto the enemy vortex field," analyzed the Major.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I see--But with the enemy concentrating his ships\r\northogonally--he\'ll build a vortex that will disintegrate each and\r\nevery ship of ours near the vortex," said the General, his mind coming\r\nup to full battle speed as it grasped the situation. "My God! 

Can\'t\r\nthey see that they\'re going to certain death?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA gong sounded in a muffled sort of way in the plotting room below Ruy,\r\nas a gentle buzz told him that the computer had relinquished control.\r\n\r\nHis fingers began to play rapidly over the keys. Swift orders of\r\nstrategy were transmitted through steel conduits deep into the computer\r\nvaults of the building. There, the orders were transposed into detailed\r\ntactics and beamed throughout the solar system. And as his fingers\r\nlimbered to the keys, he played a deadly tune, a concerto of death.\r\n\r\nThe fleet grew alive with a sudden awareness; it seemed to be a thing\r\nalive, straining at its bonds in response to the music played into its\r\ncomputers and controls. Suddenly, the fleet sprang forward. A destroyer\r\nshot out into the midst of the enemy fleet, launching all of its energy\r\nin one tremendous lurch--only to go down in a flaming wreck as the\r\nenemy ships swerved and concentrated on it. And a second ship, and then\r\na third ship repeated the frightful maneuver, until the whole heavens\r\nwere lighted with the flaming novae of berserk atomic drives.\r\n\r\n"General, sir," said the Lieutenant, with sweat rolling from his brow\r\nas he saluted.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Lieutenant," said the General looking away from the battle map of\r\nthe solar system.\r\n\r\n"We can\'t make any headway against the control room door. Must be solid\r\nsteel. Whoever got in there must have fused it shut."\r\n\r\n"Well, get a welding torch," said the General, his eyes going back to\r\nwatch the devastation of the fleet. "We\'ve got to get in--get that\r\ncomputer back on automatic. Get explosives, if necessary."\r\n\r\n"We\'ve sent for a welding torch already, sir. It\'ll be here in a few\r\nminutes."\r\n\r\n"All right. Send someone for hand grenades too. We\'ve got to stop this\r\nsabotage before the fleet is annihilated. They\'re losing ships every\r\nminute."\r\n\r\n"Sir," interposed the Captain standing nearby, "maybe we can cut off\r\nthe computer room someway. I know it\'s a direct conduit, right to the\r\nvaults from the control room, but maybe we can cut the conduits and let\r\nthe ships fall back on their emergency circuits."\r\n\r\n"Looks like a possible alternative, Captain, though we\'d put the\r\ncomputer out of operation for several days," said the General. 

"But\r\nwe\'re losing our fleet this way."\r\n\r\nSeven, eight, nine great men of war went down before the blazing force\r\nfields of the enemy, who pounced on every sacrifice offered to it by\r\nthe computer.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant turned his eyes from the incandescent glare of the thick\r\nsteel conduit glowing red under the finger of the acetylene torch.\r\n"General, its extremely resistant to cutting. I doubt if we can cut\r\nthrough it before they finally get the door and frame cut away up in\r\nthe control room.

"\r\n\r\n"Keep at it, boy. We\'ve got to get through at the saboteur one way or\r\nanother. Do the best you can. The boys in the fleet are counting on\r\nyou. 

They\'re going down to certain death while we delay."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith the last terms of the new equations of strategy played into the\r\ncomputer, Ruy sat back, gave a sigh, opened his eyes, and slipped the\r\nelectrodes from his wrist. His job was almost done. If he could keep\r\nthe others from this control panel for another half hour, the computer\r\ncould operate on his equations fully, and the battle would be won.\r\n\r\nThe first ships from Earth had already gone down in flames, expendable\r\nsacrifices to his purpose. But they were not dying in vain. The end\r\nresult would be--must be--victory.\r\n\r\n_Wars are fought by strategy, but also by sacrifice. Every general must\r\nsend troops into battle, must expect to sacrifice to make the enemy\r\ncommit himself in the desired way, and so make victory possible._\r\n\r\nThis was what Ruy believed. He believed it deeply, deeply enough to\r\nthrow aside his career as a rising young theoretical mathematics\r\nofficer of the fleet and to go over the heads of his unconvinced\r\nsuperiors, with all their unread reports and unanswered recommendations\r\nfrom subordinates, in the only way a man of action could--by taking\r\nthings into his own hands, and staking his life on the gamble.\r\n\r\nThe General, eyes riveted to the board, winced with pain as ship after\r\nship roiled the heavens with flaming death. And as he watched, a\r\ngradual subtle design became apparent. For every ship he had lost, his\r\nships had taken a similar tally--for each sacrifice, a trap was sprung\r\nand a similar toll taken. Computers did not sacrifice, did not send men\r\nout to certain death. Therefore a sacrifice was greedily snapped up\r\nas a mistake of the enemy. And such greed snapped the trap. One move\r\nforced the next, once the bait was taken.\r\n\r\nAs the theme of the theory formed in the General\'s mind, he suddenly\r\nmuttered: "Even exchange will balance a computer\'s potential--but a\r\nseries of forced, even-exchanges can distort a fleet\'s position from\r\noptimum.... I never realized it before--an optimum move is not an\r\noptimum move--if it\'s a forced move."\r\n\r\nHe turned from the board and spoke quietly to the men who stood in\r\nhushed groups watching the flaming battle.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen, we are winning a great victory; the war will soon be over."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe door to the computer room toppled outward, frame and all, after\r\nseveral ceaseless hours of cutting. The impact left the hallway of\r\narmed men silent and still, like specters in the unreal light from the\r\nglowing acetylene torch. Just inside the doorway stood a man, his youth\r\nbelied by wise and thoughtful eyes, grinding a cigarette under his\r\nfoot. And as he stepped through the wrecked and twisted door frame not\r\na hand was raised against him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


"Place to get good\r\nmeals? Decent room for the night? You can\'t go wrong with Mattapenny!"\r\n\r\nBrack did.\r\n\r\nYou see, the _Galactic Guidebook_ lists Corbie as one of the five small\r\nfuel stations sharing the outer-most orbit of the Dryodean planetary\r\nsystem. The latest edition still gives Hotel Eros two asterisks.\r\n\r\nNow, two asterisks (**) is supposed to mean "Plain but fairly\r\ncomfortable".\r\n\r\n"Sure," says Brack, "the hotel may lack an up-to-date Dreamawake or a\r\nTime-conditioner, but at least you expect your room to have a Vibrobath\r\nand controllable gravity."\r\n\r\nNone of this at the Hotel Eros. Brack shakes his head complainingly.\r\n"You sleep in a primitive 7/8G-bed. You wash yourself with\r\nold-fashioned magnetic water. And oxygen service costs 10% extra."\r\n\r\nSome people ask: "Then why in the world did you stay there?"\r\n\r\n"Had to," Bill answers. "I was hauling out of Dryod-7 with a cargo\r\nof deluplasm. Damn valuable stuff, consigned to Hesdin-2. Well, I\'d\r\nfigured the time a little wrong, and it left me with twelve hours\r\nto kill before our convoy jumped off. And you know how it is. I was\r\nfacing three weeks of interstellar rations, and I had a sudden yen\r\nfor nonsynthetic food. So I looked in the guidebook, and there was\r\nCorbie...."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBrack was disappointed from the start. When he sat at a table of the\r\nhotel restaurant and studied the menu, he saw it was all synthetics.\r\n\r\n"Blast it!" he barked into the table phone, "haven\'t you anything else?"\r\n\r\n"I understand how you feel, mister." It was a live human female voice\r\nthat answered, not the usual robot. "Hold on. 

I\'ll come out and see if\r\nI can help you."\r\n\r\nThrough the kitchen door emerged a young girl, short and white-skinned,\r\nbut very well proportioned.\r\n\r\n"Outbound?" she queried. Her pretty face was clouded by an unhappy\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\n"Yes, and I wanted something with a little taste to it, a little\r\nsubstance."\r\n\r\n"Such as what?" said the girl, tossing her long blond hair.\r\n\r\nBrack looked at the girl carnivorously. "A steak."\r\n\r\nShe smiled sympathetically. "We haven\'t anything of that sort. 

Sorry."\r\nShe stared at him with light blue eyes the color of moonstones. "How do\r\nyou happen to land at this miserable place? Fuel?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m early for my convoy."\r\n\r\nBrack stared at the girl\'s face and he could see it was the mask of\r\nsome hidden, tragic emotion.\r\n\r\n"You weren\'t thinking of staying at the Hotel Eros?" she inquired in a\r\nvoice edged with repugnance.\r\n\r\n"Well, I do have about twelve hours."\r\n\r\nThe girl was emphatic. "Take my advice, mister. Spend them in your\r\nship."\r\n\r\nA man\'s voice crackled over the table phone. "Esther!"\r\n\r\nShe looked startled. 

"Yes?" she said, leaning over the table to speak\r\ninto the phone.\r\n\r\n(\'Beautiful!\' thought Brack. \'She must have some Earth-blood in her\r\nveins.\')\r\n\r\nThe man\'s voice was angry, strident. "Don\'t gab with the customers!"\r\n\r\nEsther stood up, a blush of embarrassment on her milky-white cheeks.\r\n\r\n"Your order, please?" she said to Brack, stiffly.\r\n\r\nThe trucker put his big, brown-colored hand over the phone. "Who\'s\r\nthat character?" he asked with distaste. "The boss?"\r\n\r\nThe girl nodded unhappily. "I didn\'t realize he was listening."\r\n\r\n"Sounds like a tyrant." Brack uncovered the phone. "What\'s the closest\r\nthing you have to beefsteak?"\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you try some of our roasted pradolan? It\'s quite good," she\r\nadded for the boss\'s benefit. "Specialty of the house."\r\n\r\n"There\'s just one thing I want to know," said Brack. "Is it synthetic?"\r\n\r\nThe girl smiled sadly. "I\'d do anything for some real food myself. I\r\nhaven\'t left Corbie in seven years."\r\n\r\n"What makes you stick around a place like this? 

Married?"\r\n\r\n"No. My father owns the Eros."\r\n\r\n"You\'re free, brown and twenty-one," said Brack somewhat inaccurately.\r\n"He can\'t make you stay if you want to leave."\r\n\r\nEsther waved warningly at the table phone and Brack again covered it\r\nwith his hand.\r\n\r\n"Maybe he can\'t legally, but there\'s only one passenger ship between\r\nhere and the planets every year, and they\'ve refused me a ticket twice\r\nnow."\r\n\r\n"Sounds pretty rotten to me," said the trucker. "Well, what if you got\r\nmarried to some guy? Then he couldn\'t--"\r\n\r\nA heavy-set white man, bald and bullet-headed, strode out of the\r\nkitchen and seized the girl roughly by the arm.\r\n\r\n"Now I told you not to gab with the customers and I meant it!" he\r\nsnarled. "You get back there in the kitchen where you belong!"\r\n\r\nShe tried to wrench free of his grip. "Take your hands off me!"\r\n\r\nSlap! He batted her across the cheek with his open hand and she\r\nstaggered from the blow. "No back talk, young lady! 

Now, git!"\r\n\r\nThe trucker half rose from his seat, his fists clenched, but it was\r\nover too quickly for him to intervene. And after all, he reflected\r\nlater while eating the pradolan roast, the man was her father.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith some misgivings, Brack checked into the hotel. It was a tiny\r\ninstallation--perhaps nine or ten rooms. His own cubicle was a drab\r\naffair, with neither entertainment screen nor sleep-inducer.\r\n\r\nHe had just tested the 7/8G-bed with disgust when there was a buzz at\r\nthe door. It was Esther, holding some linens.\r\n\r\n"They have you doing everything around here," Brack said with empathy.\r\n"What are these?"\r\n\r\n"Towels. You use them after you wash.

"\r\n\r\n"Boy, this sure is ancient!"\r\n\r\nEsther\'s eyes betrayed deep torment. "I know. I would do anything to\r\nget away from this place."\r\n\r\nShe put the towels in a rack. The trucker was lying on the bed,\r\ncontemplating the girl\'s deft, graceful movements.\r\n\r\n"Listen," he said, "why wait for a passenger ship? Why not arrange\r\nsecretly with one of the cargo ships that stop here? I know if I was\r\ninbound--"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t even say it!" 

she expostulated. "It\'s very kind of you, but\r\ncertainly you\'ve heard of the Pledge Act? My father could prosecute\r\nany cargo ship, no matter where it landed in the planets. You know,\r\nunlicensed transport of people."\r\n\r\nShe paused to look at herself in a mirror above the washstand. Brack\'s\r\neyes were on her bare, marble-white shoulders, her finely sculptured\r\nbosom. She sighed.\r\n\r\n"No, my only chance is to get away from the Dryodean System altogether.\r\nIf I go to another star--where the Pledge Act wasn\'t even heard of--"\r\n\r\nShe brushed back her long blond hair with an unconscious gesture, like\r\na maiden getting out of a degravity pool.\r\n\r\nBrack said thoughtfully: "Esther, if you\'re really determined to get\r\naway from here, maybe I can help you. I\'m taking a cargo to Hesdin.\r\nYour old man couldn\'t reach you there, or prove anything against me,\r\neither."\r\n\r\nThe girl\'s moonstone eyes flared up in hope, but she hesitated. "I\r\ndon\'t have very much money. I couldn\'t make it worth your while,\r\nfinancially."\r\n\r\n"That part is unimportant. The thing for you to consider is the\r\nsituation on Hesdin-2. It\'s a new colony; life there is pretty\r\nprimitive."\r\n\r\nEsther waved at the room. "Any more so than here?"\r\n\r\nBrack grinned. "Not much more. But then also, you\'ve got to remember\r\nthat it\'s a three-week trip. Pretty monotonous. 

Just the two of us."\r\n\r\nShe looked him in the eyes with understanding.\r\n\r\n"I\'d try not to get in the way."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey met in the middle of the night at Brack\'s ship. Working slowly,\r\nsoundlessly, they opened a cargo case and removed enough unit boxes to\r\nmake room for the girl.\r\n\r\nEsther settled down in the container.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid that isn\'t too comfortable," Brack apologized, "but you\'ll\r\nonly have to put up with it four hours. I take off at seven.

"\r\n\r\n"That\'s all right, Bill. Just so there\'s no delay. My father expects me\r\nto open the dining room at seven."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll be ten million miles away before he misses you," said Brack. He\r\nput the top on loosely, faking the straps across the cover, so the\r\ngirl could breathe.\r\n\r\nIn his room again, Brack lay with arms folded under his head, thinking\r\nhoneyed thoughts. He would have Esther\'s pleasant company. 

His cargo\r\nwas a valuable one. Two-thirds of the receipts on Hesdin-2 would\r\nrepresent sheer profit. Perhaps it would be enough to establish him\r\nin some kind of a local freight business. Esther could make a man a\r\nwonderful partner. Lovely, delectable girl!\r\n\r\nHe reminded himself that they were not safely away from Corbie yet, and\r\nhe passed the remaining hours in the Hotel Eros sleeplessly anxious.\r\n\r\nBrack delayed going to his ship until the last minute before takeoff\r\ntime. Then, as he half-feared, he saw a customs officer standing beside\r\nthe airlock.\r\n\r\nThe trucker tried taking the offensive. "Gosh, I\'ll be late for my\r\nconvoy if I don\'t leave right away."\r\n\r\n"Sorry, sir, but I\'ll have to inspect your ship." He was a burly,\r\ntough-looking character in pale green uniform, blocking the doorway\r\nwith a flatfooted, wrestling stance.\r\n\r\nBrack sensed that a contest of fists might not end in his favor. He\r\nunlocked the entrance and waved the official in with reluctance. "Take\r\na look, but I\'ve already gone through customs on Dryod-7. I can show\r\nyou my clearance."\r\n\r\n"This isn\'t customs exactly," said the man. "We\'re searching for a\r\nperson."\r\n\r\n"A person?" (The old man sure kept a close watch on his daughter.) "I\'m\r\nthe only person aboard this ship."\r\n\r\nThe customs official remained polite. "Yes, I understand that, sir. 

But\r\nMr. Eros\' daughter is missing. He thinks she may have stowed away on\r\nyour ship."\r\n\r\n"Impossible! I had the ship locked."\r\n\r\nThey stepped into the pilot\'s cabin, a tetrahexahedron-shaped room\r\ncrowded with multiple-monitor screens of an astrogation-computer. Brack\r\nthrew the ignition switch to start the buildup in the ship\'s nuclear\r\nengine.\r\n\r\n"What is your cargo?" the customs man demanded.\r\n\r\n"Fifteen cases of deluplasm," said Brack with unfeigned anxiety.\r\n\r\nThe official debated with himself. "I believe it would be best if I\r\nopened the cases.

"\r\n\r\nBrack looked at his watch with desperation. "But we don\'t have time!\r\nThat would take at least a half-hour! I\'d miss the other ships! And\r\nyou know what that would mean. I couldn\'t navigate interstellar space\r\nalone, not at a hundred times the speed of light. I\'d be stuck here in\r\nthe Dryodean System until the next fleet left. That might be months!"\r\n\r\nHe grabbed the official\'s arm. "Please, fellow, give me a break!

"\r\n\r\nThe customs man considered. "Well, since the ship was locked, it\r\ndoes seem unlikely that the girl has hidden herself here. I certainly\r\nwouldn\'t want you to lose your convoy."\r\n\r\nBrack smiled in relief and started the rocket engine secondaries.\r\n\r\n"Thanks a million."\r\n\r\n"But just to protect me in case the girl has run off somewhere--I want\r\nyou to sign this form."\r\n\r\nBrack felt a twinge of suspicion, but more of a twinge of haste. "Sure.\r\nWhat kind of a form is this?"\r\n\r\n"It simply says that I inspected each case in your presence and found\r\nthe contents identical with your bill of lading. This girl has made\r\nseveral attempts to leave Corbie in the past. This is my protection in\r\ncase she\'s finally succeeded."\r\n\r\nThe customs officer made the slightest perceptible wink. Brack signed.\r\n\r\nHe took off immediately. He was already ten minutes late. He had to\r\nblast at top speed for the next hour, continually correcting his\r\nnavigation. There was no time to go back and let Esther out of the\r\ncargo room. He had to remain at the controls, feeding data into the\r\ncomputer, modifying course as solutions flashed on the screens.\r\n\r\nFinally, Brack sighted the convoy and maneuvered into pattern just as\r\nthe fleet was dematerializing into supra-space. He set his ship on\r\npantagraph-automatic with the lead navigator, then hastened to the\r\ncargo hold.\r\n\r\nEsther was not there. Neither were ten of the fifteen cases of\r\ndeluplasm. Two-thirds of his cargo had been hijacked.\r\n\r\nIt was of course pointless for Brack to turn around and raise hell on\r\nCorbie. With the waiver he\'d signed for the customs officer, he\'d only\r\nlook ridiculous. All he could do was continue to Hesdin-2 with his\r\none-third cargo. At least he\'d break even on the trip; Esther and her\r\nco-workers had been that considerate.\r\n\r\nNo, sex and space don\'t mix.\r\n\r\nAnd it\'s high time that Mr. Mattapenny deleted the Hotel Eros (**) from\r\nhis little red guidebook.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe land was dark in the softly falling rain, and the smell of green\r\nthings was in the air. The crew huddled in their cloaks and peered into\r\nthe approaching dusk as they unloaded the great silver space ship.\r\nThey were apprehensive of the stark ruins that began barely a mile from\r\nthe ship, the ruins that seemed to sprawl interminably across the flat\r\nland beside the broad river.\r\n\r\nIn the metal headquarters hut, the commander glanced nervously at his\r\nchronometer. The astrogator looked up from his interminable reckonings\r\nand smiled.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t worry, captain," he said. "They\'ll be all right. After all, we\r\nhaven\'t seen any life but a few small animals. And they ran from us."\r\n\r\nThe commander nodded absently, but went to the open door and stared out\r\ninto the rain. It made a musical tinkling on the thin metallic dome of\r\nthe hut.\r\n\r\n"I know," he said. "Perhaps that\'s why I\'m worried. It\'s the feeling of\r\ndeath here, as though it might spring at us from some corner in those\r\nruins.... I should have sent out a stronger scout party."\r\n\r\nThe astrogator shrugged and returned to his log. "If anything had gone\r\nwrong, they would have messaged us."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe commander smiled an unwilling agreement, but he stayed in the open\r\ndoor, searching the gathering darkness toward the city. He could not\r\nshake loose from the feeling of doom that had settled on him as soon\r\nas they had made their landfall and clambered from the airlocks of the\r\nspaceship. This was a strange world, the commander thought to himself.\r\nIt seemed to have everything--everything but intelligent inhabitants.\r\nThey had circled it for two days before they had chosen this wide green\r\nvalley for their landfall. They had seen cities, many of them, great\r\ncities along seacoasts and in rich plains, cities in mountains and in\r\nvalleys, but nowhere had they seen life.\r\n\r\nThe first cautious explorations after the landing that morning had\r\nshown that there was plenty of good water. The soil seemed rich, and\r\nvegetation grew in profusion, even among the ruins they had warily\r\nskirted. The atmosphere was perfect ... it was what they had searched\r\nfor through the long bitter years ... this stable atmosphere with\r\nits abundance of life-giving oxygen. And minerals aplenty ... the\r\nburned and blasted metal skeletons of the ruined city showed that. The\r\ncommander told himself that he was a fool for worrying, when he should\r\nbe shouting with joy at his luck.\r\n\r\nThere was a shout from the outpost, a laugh, and then his\r\nsecond-in-command loped through the rain, smiling broadly. Behind him\r\nwere the others, laughing and joking, shrugging their packs to the\r\nground. Gladness and wonder were in their faces and their voices, and\r\nthe commander knew that this was the world they had sought for so long.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant ducked into the doorway and paused to warm himself at\r\nthe little thermal unit. He wiped the rain from his face, reached for\r\nthe wine bottle beside the astrogator\'s work board, and tilted it.\r\n\r\n"This is it, sir," he said. He was young, and Fate had been good to\r\nhim, and he was exulting in it. "It\'s everything we ever dared dream\r\nabout. It will support the whole race, every one of us, I think, if the\r\nrest of this world is anything like what we\'ve seen this day."\r\n\r\nThe commander grinned back at him, relief plain in his face. He was\r\nphrasing the message that he would send home across the void, the\r\nmessage they had waited for down through the weary years, the years\r\nthat had rolled by while the land burned up under a blazing sun, while\r\nthe water disappeared and the atmosphere became thin.... But there was\r\nstill in him the doubt, the remnant of fear....\r\n\r\n"Did you," he spaced the words carefully, "find any sign\r\nof--intelligent life?"\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant\'s smile faded. He glanced quickly out at the men,\r\nbreaking out their rations, resting from the labor, and looked back at\r\nhis captain. He nodded.\r\n\r\n"Tracks," he said. "We came across them leading out of the deserted\r\ncity."\r\n\r\n"Many?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think so. Five or six, perhaps. And we found where they had\r\nkilled one of the small animals and eaten it."\r\n\r\n"Did they seem--intelligent? 

Really, I mean?"\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant shrugged. "Who knows? 

They\'re bipeds, at any rate. We\r\nfollowed the tracks, but they had taken to a small stream bed, and we\r\nlost them.

"\r\n\r\nThe commander pondered. Then he made his decision.\r\n\r\n"In a country as large as this," he said, "five or six can\'t make any\r\ndifference to us, not even to a small party like our own. And certainly\r\nnot when the ships begin arriving from home.

"\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant leaned back on his pack, his face content. The commander\r\nsat at a field desk and started writing, carefully, knowing that\r\nwhat he wrote would someday be in every textbook. The message was not\r\ndifficult, really. Thousands of space captains had phrased the message\r\nin their minds down through, the years of The Search. So had he, time\r\nand again, as he lay in his bunk or watched the wheeling stars from\r\nthe bridge. In the glow of the thermal unit his stern face glowed with\r\npride and the certainty that it was his ship that had saved a world....\r\n\r\nIn another hut the scholar stared thoughtfully at the thing he had\r\nfound in the old house where they had discovered the tracks. There had\r\nbeen a language on this dead world, and in his hand he held some of the\r\nbrown mouldering pages upon which the language had been written. He\r\napplied his scholar\'s mind to the puzzle....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe city crouched grimly about them. Even though they had neither seen\r\nnor heard any life in these streets save a few small animals who had\r\nfled their coming, they gripped their projectors at the ready.\r\n\r\nAlmost every structure had been damaged. Many were mere twisted heaps\r\nof debris, timbers and girders thrusting insanely at a sky that today\r\nwas blue and benign. The taller, sturdier buildings still stood, but\r\ntheir walls were cracked and their windows gaping hollow eyes in the\r\nblank faces. Rubble clogged the streets, and grass had split the\r\npavements. Here and there among the ruins a sapling stood bravely, its\r\nroots grasping in the shattered masonry.\r\n\r\nIn the streets, rusting and ancient, were objects which they surmised\r\nmust have been vehicles. In some of them they found fragments of bone\r\nand shreds of clothing. They had seen other bones; in doorways, on the\r\nground floors of the few buildings they had penetrated.\r\n\r\n"Whatever it was," the second-in-command said, "it struck them swiftly."\r\n\r\n"Some sickness, a virus, perhaps?" the astrogator suggested.\r\n\r\nThe commander shook his head. "War," he said. 

"Only war could do this\r\nto a city."\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant said admiringly, "Whoever they were, they certainly\r\ndeveloped some pretty terrific weapons."\r\n\r\nThe commander had smiled, and patted his projector. "No more terrific\r\nthan these," he said. "Our own people developed weapons, too. Thank the\r\nstars that we have learned not to use them on each other."\r\n\r\nThe scholar looked up from the inscription he had found on the side of\r\na building.\r\n\r\n"And thank the stars," he said, "that we learned in time. The people of\r\nthis world apparently did not."\r\n\r\nIt was then, while they spoke, that from somewhere in the ruins there\r\nwas a sharp crack, and one of the crew spun around and fell in the\r\nstreet. In the shattered silence of the city the sound echoed crazily.\r\n\r\n"Take cover!" the captain shouted, and he plunged into a huge doorway,\r\npeering around the protecting portal. There was another crack, and\r\nsomething whined by him.\r\n\r\n"Projectile weapon!" 

whispered the lieutenant behind him. He was prone,\r\nsighting his projector at a half-ruined four-story house at the corner.\r\nHe pressed the control switch, once, and a section of the second floor\r\nseemed to explode into hurtling gray dust and shrieking steel.\r\n\r\nOther projectors were spitting from doorways and from behind piles of\r\nbrick and debris in the streets. The captain, watching the building\r\nfrom which the answering fire seemed to come, thought he saw movement\r\nbehind one of the blank windows. Before he could take aim, there was a\r\nripping series of shots and the masonry of the portal flew into dust.\r\nHe heard the low flat whine of ricochets, and he withdrew deeper into\r\nthe dimness of the great entranceway. Up the street he heard a crew\r\nmember cry out in pain.\r\n\r\n"The second floor!" he cried, and a hurricane of electron bolts ripped\r\ninto the building at the corner. The building seemed to rip apart\r\nunder the impact and there was the roar of falling bricks and timber\r\nas a floor gave way with a crash. They dashed out of cover, crouching,\r\nfiring as they went.\r\n\r\nThey found three bodies in the ruins. Bipeds. Pale pasty flesh, faces\r\nhalf-hidden by tangled hair. The bodies were only partially clad in\r\nfaded tattered clothes, and the feet were encased in what appeared\r\nto be the tanned hide of an animal. The flesh and the clothing were\r\nfilthy, and they stank. The bodies were huddled around their weapon, a\r\nmetallic-looking projectile-thrower mounted on three legs. Its barrel\r\nwas still hot.\r\n\r\nA little later they flushed another of the creatures in a narrow\r\nstreet. It howled gibberish at them and fled, but they cornered the\r\nthing against a heap of rubble. It mouthed things at them, and hurled\r\nbits of brick. Its eyes were wild and staring, and spittle trickled\r\ndown the face into the sodden filthy rags it wore. They had to kill it,\r\nfinally.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _They had to kill it, finally._]\r\n\r\nThe commander turned the dead thing over with his projector stock, and\r\nstared at it.\r\n\r\n"Mad," he said. "There are only a few of them, and they are mad.

"\r\n\r\nThe scholar nodded. He had found many of the writings, and they were\r\nstuffed in his pack and in his pockets, and he held one while he talked.\r\n\r\n"They are mad," he said, "and there cannot be many of them. Certainly\r\nnot enough to halt the advance of civilization."\r\n\r\nIt was as if he saw, already, the soaring towers of the cities they\r\nwould build here over the pitiful ruins, as though the busy highways\r\nalready spanned this rich new world.\r\n\r\n"We have won our bridgehead here," he said. "Soon we will have won the\r\nworld. The world," he looked down at the carcass at his feet, "that\r\nthese poor fools threw away."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe scholar made his greatest find late that afternoon, on the\r\nstreet-level floor of an almost-intact building. It must have been\r\na place where writings had been stored, or perhaps sold. The brown\r\nrotting pages were everywhere, and the mouldering covers in which the\r\nwritings had been bound. The scholar cried out with pleasure, and the\r\ncommander was forced to delay their return to the ship so that the crew\r\ncould carry part of the loot with them, for further study.\r\n\r\nThe scholar was squatting in a corner of the room, poring over one of\r\nthe ancient records, when he looked up and shouted, "I think I\'ve got\r\nit! I think I\'ve got it! I think I\'ve found the key to their language!"\r\n\r\nThe commander had smiled indulgently, for though he believed in\r\naction, he had respect for the scholar, and knew that the things the\r\nscholar might discover in the old writings might help him in his own\r\ntask as leader of the expedition.\r\n\r\nIt was then that the creatures attacked for the last time. They must\r\nhave crept into the building and gathered there in the dimness, waiting\r\ntheir opportunity. 

There were six of them. They poured through a rear\r\ndoor into the room of writings, howling, their projectile-throwers\r\nbarking. Their wild ululations were the screams of the demented. The\r\ncommander could see the madness in their eyes and he knew why he had\r\nbeen afraid.\r\n\r\nThe astrogator was down before they could return the fire, and then the\r\nprojectors cracked out their blue-flamed doom.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant cursed as he was hit; he dropped to one knee, firing\r\nswiftly, and then the creatures were down and it was over. The wild\r\nbearded faces were charred and blackened, and in the sudden silence was\r\nthe crackle of the little blue flames as they danced over the filthy\r\nragged clothing of the dead. The commander let his breath go, at last,\r\nin a long gasping sigh.\r\n\r\nHe started to walk toward the bodies, knowing that they were the\r\nlast, knowing that if there had been any more they would have waited,\r\ngathering strength, and they would not have made the crazy suicidal\r\nattack. The fighting was over. The savage creatures, unbalanced by\r\ntheir miserable existence among the ruins of the glory that had been\r\ntheirs, would never again threaten the bridgehead he had carved on this\r\nworld. It was his world now.\r\n\r\nThere was a frantic tugging at his sleeve, and he shook the battle fog\r\nfrom his eyes and grinned at the scholar. The commander remembered\r\nthat even while the fight had roared hot and sharp, the scholar had\r\nnot moved from his corner, nor taken his eyes from the pages he was\r\nstudying. And now the scholar was fairly dancing with excitement.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got it!" he said, almost chortling. 

"It wasn\'t hard with the\r\nkey--and I found the key!"\r\n\r\nHe gestured toward the little tangle of bodies, silent in the room of\r\nwritings.\r\n\r\n"They called themselves \'Men,\'" he said.\r\n\r\nThe commander shrugged.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


"This is ridiculous," he said.\r\n\r\nThe light chatter ceased. Cocktail glasses were set down on various\r\nhandy tables and ledges; and all faces in the room turned toward a man\r\nin his late fifties who sat propped up invalid-wise on pillows in a\r\nchair in a corner of the room.\r\n\r\n"The Comptroller is perspicacious," said the old man, agreeably,\r\nwaving one hand in a casual manner. "On your way, children.

"\r\n\r\nAnd the people present smiled and nodded. Quite as if it were an\r\nordinary leave-taking, they pushed past Terri Mac and filed out the\r\ndoor. Even the blonde, Terri had picked up at the embassy ball and who\r\nhad brought him here, strolled off casually, but in a decidedly less\r\ndrunken fashion than she had exhibited earlier in the evening.\r\n\r\n"Sit down," said the old man. Terri Mac did so, gazing searchingly at\r\nthe skinny frame and white eyebrows in an unsuccessful effort to\r\nconnect him with something in memory. "This is ridiculous," he\r\nrepeated.\r\n\r\n"Really?" The old man smiled benignly. "And why so?"\r\n\r\n"Why--" the situation was so obvious that Terri fumbled--a little at a\r\nloss for words. "Obviously you intend some form of coercion, or else\r\nyou would have come to me along recognized channels. And any thought\r\nof coercion is obviously--well, ridiculous."\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"Why? You senile old fool, don\'t you know that I\'m shielded? Don\'t you\r\nknow all government officials from the fifth class up wear complete\r\npersonal shields that are not only crack-proof but contain all the\r\nnecessary elements to support life independently within the shield\r\nfor more than twenty hours? Don\'t you know that I\'ll be missed in two\r\nhours at the most and tracked down in less than sixty minutes more?\r\nAre you crazy?"\r\n\r\nThe old man chuckled, rubbing dry hands together. He said, "I\'m\r\nshielded too. You can\'t get at me. And now the room\'s shielded. You\r\ncan\'t get out of it."\r\n\r\nTerri stared at him. The initial shock was passing. His own statements\r\nanent the completeness of his protection had brought back confidence,\r\nand his natural coolness was returning. "What do you want?" he asked,\r\neyeing the other narrowly.\r\n\r\n"Pleasure of your company," said the old man. "There are some very\r\nstrong connections between us. Yes, very strong. We must get to know\r\neach other personally."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt occurred to Terri that he had misinterpreted the situation. Relief\r\ncame, mixed with a certain amount of chagrin at the way in which he\r\nallowed himself to show alarm. He had looked ridiculous. He leaned\r\nback in the chair and allowed a note of official hauteur and annoyance\r\nto creep into his voice. "I see," he said. "You want something?"\r\n\r\nThe old man nodded energetically.\r\n\r\n"I do. Indeed I do."\r\n\r\n"And you think you have some kind of a bargaining tool that is useful\r\nbut might not be so if it became known to official channels."\r\n\r\n"Well--" said the old man cautiously.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t waste my time," interrupted Terri, harshly. "I\'m not an\r\nordinary politician. No man who works his way up to the fifth level of\r\nthe government is. I didn\'t get to where I am today by pussy-footing\r\naround and I haven\'t the leisure to spend on people who do. Now _what_\r\ndo you want?

"\r\n\r\nThe other cackled. 

"Now, what do you think?" he said, putting one\r\nfinger to his nose cunningly.\r\n\r\n"You are old," Terri said. "And therefore cautious. Consequently you\r\nwould not risk trying to force something from me, but are almost\r\ncertainly trying to sell me something. Now what do I want? 

Not the\r\nusual things, certainly. Within my position I have all the material\r\nthings a man could want; and within my shield I enjoy complete\r\nimmunity. No one but the Central Bureau, itself, can crack this\r\nshield. And no one but they can prevent the conditioned reflex that\r\nstops my heart if for some reason the shield should be broached. I\r\nhave a hold on every man beneath me that prevents him from knifing me\r\nin the back. There could be only one thing that I want that you could\r\ngive me--" he leaned forward, staring into the deep-pouched eyes--"and\r\nthat is a means of getting at the man above me. Am I right?"\r\n\r\n"No," said the old man.\r\n\r\nTerri stiffened.\r\n\r\n"No?" he echoed in angry incredulity.\r\n\r\nTheir eyes locked. For a long time they held, and at last Terri looked\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThe old man sighed--sipped noisily from a drink on the table beside\r\nhis chair.\r\n\r\n"Wait!" said Terri. To his own surprise, his voice was eager, even a\r\nlittle timorous in its hopefulness. "Wait. I\'ve got it. There will be\r\na test. There always is a test every time a man moves up. His\r\nsuperiors watch him when he doesn\'t suspect it. It will be that way\r\nfor me when I am ready for the fourth level. And you have some kind of\r\nadvance information. You know what the test will be. Maybe you know\r\nthe man who will administer it. You want to sell me this information."\r\n\r\nThe other said nothing.\r\n\r\n"Well," Terri spread his hands openly. "I am interested. I\'ll buy.\r\nWhat do you want. Money? A favor? Protection?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"No?" Terri shouted, starting up from his chair. "What do you mean by\r\nno? Can\'t you say anything but \'no\'?" A rage possessed him. He flung\r\nhimself forward two furious steps to stand threateningly over the aged\r\nfigure. "You doddering idiot! Say what you want, and quickly! My two\r\nhours are nearly up. 

I\'ll be missed. They\'ll be here in a few\r\nminutes--the Bureau Guards. They\'ll crack the room shield. They\'ll\r\nrescue me. And they\'ll take you into custody. To be questioned. To be\r\nexecuted. At my order. 

Do you understand? 

Your life depends on me."\r\n\r\nAfter a little, the old man chuckled again. "Yes," he muttered, in a\r\nhigh-pitched old voice. "That\'s the way it\'ll be."\r\n\r\nTerri stared at him. "You don\'t seem to understand. 

You\'re going to\r\ndie."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes," said the old man, nodding his head indulgently. "I\'ll die.\r\nBut I\'m an old man. I\'d die anyway in a year or so--maybe in a day or\r\nso. But for you--for a young man like you--the up and coming young\r\ngovernmental with everything to lose--" he leered slyly at Terri.\r\n"Your death won\'t be so easy for you to take."\r\n\r\n"I die?" echoed Terri, stupefied. "But I\'m not going to die. They\'re\r\ncoming to _rescue_ me."\r\n\r\n"Oh, are they?" said the old man, ironically.\r\n\r\n"Of course!" said Terri. "Of course, why shouldn\'t they?"\r\n\r\nThe old man winked one faded eye portentously.\r\n\r\n"Fine young man," he said. "Up and coming young man. Brilliant. Never\r\na thought for the people he trampled on the way up the ladder. Dear\r\nme, no.

"\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" said Terri.\r\n\r\nThe old eyes, looking up suddenly, pierced him.\r\n\r\n"Do you remember Kilaren?"\r\n\r\n"K-Kilaren?"\r\n\r\n"Kilaren," recited the old man as if quoting from a newspaper. "The\r\nbeautiful young secretary of a provincial governor whose lecherous and\r\nunnatural pursuit drove her to suicide. So that one day to escape the\r\ngovernor, she jumped or fell from a high window. And the people of the\r\nprovince, who had for a long time heard ugly stories and rumors,\r\nfinally mobbed the office and lynched the governor, hanging him from\r\nthe same window from which the girl had jumped. They said that even\r\nthe fall had not spoiled her beauty, but that was probably false." The\r\nold man\'s words dwindled away into silence.\r\n\r\n"If so what of it?" said Terri. "What\'s that to do with me?

"\r\n\r\n"Why, you were there. You were the governor\'s aide, and when the mob\r\nhad gone home and feeling had slackened off, you stepped into the gap\r\nand seized up the reins of government, handling matters so skillfully\r\nthat you were immediately promoted to an under-post at Government\r\nCity."\r\n\r\n"What of it?"\r\n\r\n"Why it was all your doing," replied the other, in a mildly reproving\r\nvoice, "the rumors, the stories, the mob, even the suicide. Poor\r\nKilaren--a pitiful pawn in your ruthless game to eliminate the\r\ngovernor in your mad dash up the ladder."\r\n\r\n"I never touched her!" cried Terri, his voice cracking. "I swear it."\r\n\r\n"Who said you did? The type of mind that stoops to murder would never\r\nhave gotten you this far. But you were the one who hired her, knowing\r\nthe governor\'s tendencies. You were the one that gave her work that\r\nkept her, night after night, alone with the man. You preyed upon her\r\nfear of losing her job. You threw the sin in her face after she had\r\ncommitted it. You told her what she might have been, and what she was,\r\nand what she would be. You broke her, day after day. In the sterile\r\nprivacy of the office you reviled her, scorned her, brought her to\r\nbelieve that she was what she was not, a creature of filth and\r\ndishonor. You blocked off all avenues of escape but the one that led\r\nthrough one high window. _You killed her!_"\r\n\r\n"No!"\r\n\r\n"Yes!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTerri brought his quivering hands together and clenched them in his\r\nlap. He stared at the old man. "Who are you?"\r\n\r\n"I was a friend of hers. We lived in the same hotel-apartment. She had\r\nno family. I believe you knew that when you hired her."\r\n\r\n"I see," said Terri. He drew a long, deep, shuddering breath, and\r\nleaned back in the chair. "So that\'s the story," he said, his voice\r\nstrengthening, "I might have known it. Blackmail. There are always\r\nfools that want to try blackmail."\r\n\r\n"No," said the old man. "Not Blackmail, Comptroller. I want your\r\nlife."\r\n\r\nTerri laughed shortly, contemptuously. "No knowledge that you have can\r\nthreaten my life."\r\n\r\n"They will come," said the old man, leaning wearily back against his\r\ncushions. "As you said, the Bureau Guards will come; and I think I\r\nshall kill myself when I hear them starting to crack the shield around\r\nthis room. They will come in and find you with a dead man. What will\r\nyou tell them, Terri?"\r\n\r\n"Tell them? Anything I choose. They won\'t question _me_."\r\n\r\n"No. The guards won\'t. But the Bureau will. How can they raise a man\r\nto the fourth level when there is a two-hour mystery in his\r\nbackground? They will want to know what you were doing here."\r\n\r\n"I was kidnapped," said Terri.\r\n\r\n"By whom? Can you prove it? And why?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been held a prisoner here."\r\n\r\n"By a dead man? No, no, Terri. 

The circumstances are suspicious. You\r\nwalk away from the embassy under your own power. You disappear and are\r\nfound in a shielded room with a man who has committed suicide. This\r\nmust be explained, and in the end you will have to tell them the\r\ntruth.

"\r\n\r\n"And what if I do?" said Terri, truculently.\r\n\r\n"But the truth is so fantastic, Terri. So uncheckable. I am dead, and\r\nI am the only one who could have supported your story. These people\r\nwho were here when you came in are common actors. They have no idea\r\nwhy I wanted you decoyed here. These are my rooms. And there is no\r\nobvious connection between me and the dead Kilaren. And perhaps I will\r\ndecide to live just long enough to denounce you as a traitor when they\r\nenter."\r\n\r\nAshen-faced, Terri stared.\r\n\r\n"The Bureau will have to question you. They will clamp a block on your\r\nmind so that you can\'t operate the reflex that stops your heart. And\r\nthey will question you over and over again, because the Bureau cannot\r\nafford to take chances. You will go into a private hell of your own,\r\nTerri Mac. You will tell the story of your own evil to that girl over\r\nand over again, pleading to be believed. And they will not believe\r\nyou. And in the end they will kill you, just to be on the safe side.\r\nBecause, you see, you _might_ have been doing something traitorous in\r\nthese two shielded hours."\r\n\r\nTerri\'s head bobbed limply, like a drunken man\'s. 

He made one last\r\neffort. "Why?" he said. "Why do you do this? Your life. 

For a girl who\r\nwas no connection to you?"\r\n\r\nThe old man folded his hands.\r\n\r\n"I was a little like your governor," he said. "We all have our sins. I\r\nloved Kilaren and the shock of her death wrecked my health." He cocked\r\nhis head suddenly on one side. "Listen," he said.\r\n\r\nFrom beyond the closed door of the room, a high-pitched humming was\r\nbarely audible. It grew in volume, going up the scale. Terri leaped to\r\nhis feet; and for the space of a couple of seconds, he lunged first\r\nthis way then that, like a wild animal beating against its trap. Then,\r\nas if all will had at last gone out of him, he stopped in the middle\r\nof the room and closed his eyes. For a fraction of a moment he stood\r\nthere, before a faint convulsion seized him and he fell.\r\n\r\nWith a faint smile on his face, the old man reached out to a hidden\r\nswitch and cut the shield about the room. Uniformed guards tumbled\r\nthrough the door, to pull up in dismay at the sight of the body on the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry," said the old man, "I must have turned the shield on by\r\nmistake. I was trying to signal someone. 

The Comptroller seems to have\r\nhad a heart attack."\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s No Shield from the Dead, by Gordon Rupert Dickson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n


]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sun was a shrunken red disk against the starfields, a distant\r\npale luminosity surrendering to the encroachment of the falling night.\r\nHoarfrost crunched under Marley\'s feet as he walked by the still black\r\nwaters of the canal, and then thin wind whispered over the sand and\r\nacross the breasts of the ancient hills. Starlight gleamed in the dark\r\nwater as the day faded. Earth hung low in the sky, like an emerald\r\npendant over the bosom of a sleeping woman.\r\n\r\nMarley pulled his silks and furs closer about his shoulders. The air\r\nwas sharp and cold. His breath froze wraithlike in the icy evening as\r\nhe hurried down the path toward Tydore\'s tower.\r\n\r\nThe green planet shone like a beacon in his eyes. Home. The thought\r\nbrought impatience and a longing to walk again under a pale sky and a\r\nwarm sun. He looked about him with faint distaste. This peace--this\r\nsolitude of low red hills and blue-black nights--was alien to Marley.\r\nIt was unreal. Mars was a dream. An ancient wasted slumbering dream.\r\n\r\nMarley\'s lips compressed as he thought of Tydore and their last\r\nmeeting. It seemed that Tydore laughed at him. Tydore withheld too\r\nmuch, and there was so little time left. There was an acrid core\r\nof decadence in the old Martian, Marley thought. A consciousness\r\nof too many millenia of civilization and decay. Devious was the\r\nword, perhaps, though it seemed a pallid one for the reality of the\r\nMartian\'s intricate mind. It was always impossible to know what he was\r\nthinking--how much he knew. About Marley being a spy. About the war on\r\nEarth. In spite of himself, Marley smiled. It sounded so melodramatic\r\nthat way, but it was the way it really was. The Martians held the\r\nperfect weapon. Marley needed that weapon, and his nation had put forth\r\na gigantic effort to get him to Mars so that he might steal it.\r\n\r\nTydore\'s tower loomed up before him in the fading light, a fey\r\nfilligree of minarettes and graceful flying buttresses too delicate\r\nfor a grosser world than Mars. The tower\'s reflection shimmered in the\r\nstill dark waters of the canal like an alter ego extending deep into\r\nthe liquid depths.\r\n\r\nMarley descended the steps of delicately wrought stone that led to the\r\ntower\'s underground entrance with care, for the drifted ferric sand\r\nmade them treacherous. How like the Martians, he thought with some\r\nirritation, to make it necessary to travel down in order to enter a\r\ntower. Everything the long way, the hard and devious way.\r\n\r\nThe outer doorway was shaped like a fleur-de-lis and it opened from the\r\ntop down, sliding into a recess of ancient, oily machinery. It would\r\nbe far too simple to make a door that looked and worked like a door.\r\nEverything Marley had seen during his months on Mars served only to\r\nincrease his sense of alienage. He had seen only Tydore, of course, of\r\nthe living Martians. There were only a handful left and they lived\r\nin their isolated towers along the still canals surrounded by their\r\ntissue-thin manuscripts and ancient, reedlike music spools that filled\r\nthe air of their retreats with skeins of weird and enharmonic melody.\r\n\r\nThe weapon was Tydore\'s. He had rebuilt it from plans drawn by some\r\nensorcelled armorer dead over five thousand years. Rebuilt it in the\r\nparadoxical way that Martians seemed to do everything, for if there was\r\none thing that no Martian needed it was a weapon. No strife had marred\r\nthe planet\'s peace for millenia. But build it he had, and Marley\'s\r\nhands itched for the sleek deadliness of it--the smooth grained stock,\r\nthe oddly wrought, ornate muzzle. There was a vicious, tangy violence\r\nfrozen into every line of the weapon. And it was the only hand gun\r\nMarley had ever seen that chained the forces of the atom. With such\r\nweapons an army could be invincible.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTydore stood to greet him. With the elaborate courtesy of his kind, he\r\nperformed the ritual gestures of welcome, his slender, finely veined\r\nhands tracing the ancient symbols in the air.\r\n\r\n"The gods of sand and wind have brought you safely to my house, man\r\nof Earth. I give thanks and pray you find peace and wisdom within my\r\nwalls."\r\n\r\nThe old Martian\'s chanting voice was like the fluting grace of a\r\nScarlatti choral. It was one with the miniscule paintings that covered\r\nthe walls, the finely wrought carvings on the antique flagstones under\r\nhis feet. Marley was not at home in the fluid Martian tongue, but the\r\nvery sound of the words conjured for him the serried ranks of spectral\r\ngenerations that had reached their culmination in this one robed\r\nancient.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, he thought with irritation, Tydore\'s words mean not at all\r\nwhat they said. Through the finely polished phrases of welcome ran\r\na thread of hidden mockery--even hate--for Marley and everything he\r\nrepresented. Never once had Tydore, by word or deed, indicated that he\r\nfelt anything but friendship for his visitor from the silvery ship out\r\non the desert, and yet there was no mistaking the nuance of contempt.\r\nTydore despised Marley as an outworld savage. One with the despoilers\r\nof the holy places of Mars.\r\n\r\nNot that the Martians had gods. 

They had lived too long for that, and\r\ntheir deities existed only in their beautifully turned phrases and\r\ntheir hyper-cultured ritual. But the first men from Earth had looted\r\nthe libraries and shattered the soaring towers. It was a thing no\r\nMartian would ever forget--or forgive. It marked Earthmen for what\r\nthey were. In Martian eyes--precocious barbarians. Targets for Martian\r\nsubtlety.\r\n\r\n"I give thanks for your welcome," Marley said slowly, his tongue clumsy\r\non the singing syllables.\r\n\r\nTydore inclined his head slightly and indicated that Marley should\r\nfollow him up the winding ramp that pierced the core of the tower. Each\r\ntime Marley came, the ritual was the same, as unchanging as the still\r\nwaters of the dark canals or the frozen loneliness of the red hills\r\nbeyond. They would pass the first level, where the old engines supplied\r\nTydore with what little heat and sustenance he needed. 

They would go on\r\nto the second level, where the music spools lay in ordered confusion\r\namid the sonic transcribers that Tydore used to weave the sounds of the\r\nMartian night into atonal poems of melody. And then they would reach\r\nthe level of the weapon.\r\n\r\nIt would still be in its crystal case, guarded by a lock of bronze. A\r\nlock to which there was one key, and that one key on a silver chain\r\naround Tydore\'s neck. They would pass the weapon by and seek the top\r\nlevel, a platform shielded against the frigid night by a crystal\r\ncanopy. And there they would begin their nightly fencing with words and\r\nideas under the guise of friendship.\r\n\r\nMarley\'s heart was pounding suddenly as he drew near to the weapon. His\r\npatience was failing him at long last, he knew. He was sick of Mars,\r\nsick of Tydore. Sick of posing as a humble seeker after knowledge. If\r\nhe could not trick the Martian into parting with the weapon soon, he\r\nknew that he must chance violence. He had not dared it before, because\r\nhe could never be sure that Tydore and his kind were as defenseless as\r\nthey seemed. It was paradoxical that they should possess a weapon such\r\nas _the_ weapon and yet be unwilling or unable to use it.\r\n\r\nStill it seemed to Marley that such must be the case. He could only\r\nexplain it to himself by saying that they had lived too long, amid\r\ntoo much deviousness and inverted purpose to be quite virile. They\r\nwere--the word came readily to mind from the days of his training on\r\nEarth--decadent. And the meek did not inherit the earth or anything\r\nelse, he told himself with satisfaction. Only the militant, the\r\nruthless.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe time had come, Marley thought, for the calculated risk. Direct\r\naction. He could scarcely contain himself as they passed the weapon and\r\nclimbed to the top level.\r\n\r\n"You seem preoccupied tonight, Marley," Tydore said, pouring two tiny\r\ngoblets of wine, "Can it be that you grow tired of Mars?"\r\n\r\nMarley sipped the wine thoughtfully. 

To him it seemed completely\r\ninsipid and without flavor. Subtlety again? 

He doubted it. 

"I mean to\r\nask a favor of you, Tydore," he said, "And I but ponder how I should\r\nbegin."\r\n\r\n"My house is yours," the Martian replied softly, "And all that it\r\ncontains."\r\n\r\nMarley\'s eyes narrowed. Did he imagine the accent on the last phrase,\r\nor was it actually there? He decided to be very cautious. "I came here,\r\nas you know," he said, "To learn everything I might about your kind. As\r\nyou know, we of Earth are a young race, still much in need of guidance\r\nand knowledge."\r\n\r\n"You have learned much," Tydore said.\r\n\r\nMarley\'s tone grew harder. "But not enough."\r\n\r\nTydore\'s eyebrows arched delicately. 

"So? You have read my books,\r\nlistened to my music. You have tasted the wines and eaten the fruits of\r\nMars. 

You have seen the stars and the sand, the waters and the lichens.\r\nHave you not known my world?"\r\n\r\n"I want more," Marley said flatly.\r\n\r\nTydore smiled. In that smile Marley saw a flash of more distilled\r\nvenom and ancient hatred that he could have imagined existed. The utter\r\nvirulence of it left him shaken and his illogical fear brought anger.\r\n\r\nHe got to his feet, the tiny goblet in his hand. It was old and\r\ndelicate, a tiny gem of carved jade and ivory. To one such as\r\nTydore--priceless. Brutally, Marley crushed it to shards in his hands\r\nand dropped it to the flagstones. The fragments tinkled as they fell.\r\n\r\n"So it must always be," said Tydore in a soft voice.\r\n\r\n"I have not come here to listen to music, Tydore," Marley said, "Nor to\r\nread your books or to know your world. You have one thing that I want.\r\nYou will give it to me, or I will take it from you." He ground his heel\r\nonto the remains of the goblet with a grating sound.\r\n\r\n"The weapon," the Martian said, "You want the weapon. You may have it.\r\nYou need not have broken my goblet...."\r\n\r\nMarley was almost sorry that he had won so easily. He suddenly wanted\r\nto crush the old Martian as he had crushed the goblet. In both there\r\nwas a quality that eluded him, and it was maddening.\r\n\r\nTydore handed him the key. "Come, we will get it together."\r\n\r\nMarley followed him cautiously, alert for any trickery. Presently they\r\nstood before the case and Marley unlocked it, reaching greedily for\r\nthe polished stock. He cradled the gun in his arms lovingly, savoring\r\ntriumph. With this in his hands, he could defy a world.\r\n\r\n"There is no other like it, nor any but I to make one," Tydore said\r\nwith a strange smile.\r\n\r\n"Why did you make it?" asked Marley.\r\n\r\n"I made it for you."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "_I made it for you...._"]\r\n\r\nMarley laughed aloud. It was an alien sound in the thin, cold air of\r\nthe tower. "You\'re a liar, Tydore. You built this weapon long before I\r\never left Earth and you know it."\r\n\r\n"By you, I meant simply men like you," Tydore said. "When the first\r\nEarthmen came and befouled Mars with their presence, I knew that I\r\nmust make the weapon." He smiled, showing even white teeth. "A small\r\ntriumph, but things are not to be measured by whether they are great\r\nor small. 

Rather by their flavor, their grace, and their neatness,\r\nMarley."\r\n\r\n"You speak of triumph, old man," snorted Marley derisively, "while your\r\nprecious weapon is in my hands."\r\n\r\nTydore shrugged. "As I knew it would be one day when I spread the tales\r\nof what the weapon would do. It drew you as a lodestone draws a sliver\r\nof iron."\r\n\r\nMarley felt a pang of panic. "You mean this thing is a fake?"\r\n\r\nTydore shook his head. "No counterfeit. It will do what I said it would\r\ndo. 

Kill. 

What more can one ask of a weapon?"\r\n\r\nIt was Marley\'s turn to smile. "Nothing. And there is only this one.\r\nAnd if you were to die...."\r\n\r\nTydore smiled a veiled smile. "It is as the gods of sand and wind\r\ndecree."\r\n\r\nMarley pointed the weapon at Tydore. He had only to kill the old\r\nMartian and return to his ship. The mission was over. 

Completed. He was\r\ndone with Mars and with Tydore and his subtle scorn.\r\n\r\nHe cradled the weapon lovingly, laying his cheek to the carven stock.\r\nOld Tydore had built well. There was perfect balance in the feel of\r\nit. His finger curled around the trigger and he sighted carefully down\r\nthe long barrel at the robed figure of the Martian. Tydore was smiling\r\nin the face of death, and Marley wanted to laugh out loud. This is the\r\nway the world ends, he was thinking. Not with a bang but a whimper. He\r\nsqueezed the trigger....\r\n\r\nThe universe exploded in Marley\'s face. There was a streak of searing\r\npain that carried away half his face, and as he fell he could hear a\r\nstrange sound. For the first time, Tydore was laughing aloud. It was a\r\nhideous sound. A voice for the torment and hatred of a race that had\r\nlived too long, planned too much. Marley felt the tower pinwheel around\r\nhim, the flagstones leapt up to meet him, greeting the searing agony of\r\nhis face with the soundless laughter of a million intricate patterns of\r\nlonely death. And blackness welled up out of the stones to engulf him,\r\nbut not before he knew--\r\n\r\nTydore had made the weapon with the muzzle resembling the stock. It was\r\nas simple as that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\n"Is there anything you want to make disappear?" Clarence Willoughby\r\nasked his mother.\r\n\r\n"A sink full of dishes is all I can think of. How will you do it?

"\r\n\r\n"I just built a disappearer. All you do is cut the other end out of a\r\nbeer can. Then you take two pieces of red cardboard with peepholes in\r\nthe middle and fit them in the ends. You look through the peepholes and\r\nblink. Whatever you look at will disappear."\r\n\r\n"Oh."\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t know if I can make them come back. We\'d better try it on\r\nsomething else. 

Dishes cost money."\r\n\r\nAs always, Myra Willoughby had to admire the wisdom of her\r\nnine-year-old son. She would not have had such foresight herself. He\r\nalways did.\r\n\r\n"You can try it on Blanche Manners\' cat outside there. Nobody will care\r\nif it disappears except Blanche Manners."\r\n\r\n"All right."\r\n\r\nHe put the disappearer to his eye and blinked. The cat disappeared from\r\nthe sidewalk outside.\r\n\r\nHis mother was interested. "I wonder how it works. 

Do you know how it\r\nworks?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. You take a beer can with both ends cut out and put in two pieces\r\nof cardboard. Then you blink."\r\n\r\n"Never mind. Take it outside and play with it. 

You hadn\'t better make\r\nanything disappear in here till I think about this."\r\n\r\nBut when he had gone his mother was oddly disturbed.\r\n\r\n"I wonder if I have a precocious child. Why, there\'s lots of grown\r\npeople who wouldn\'t know how to make a disappearer that would work. I\r\nwonder if Blanche Manners will miss her cat very much?"\r\n\r\nClarence went down to the Plugged Nickel, a pot house on the corner.\r\n\r\n"Do you have anything you want to make disappear, Nokomis?"\r\n\r\n"Only my paunch."\r\n\r\n"If I make it disappear it\'ll leave a hole in you and you\'ll bleed to\r\ndeath."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right, I would. Why don\'t you try it on the fire plug outside?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis in a way was one of the happiest afternoons ever in the\r\nneighborhood. The children came from blocks around to play in the\r\nflooded streets and gutters, and if some of them drowned (and we don\'t\r\nsay that they _did_ drown) in the flood (and brother! it was a flood),\r\nwhy, you have to expect things like that. The fire engines (whoever\r\nheard of calling fire engines to put out a flood?) were apparatus-deep\r\nin the water. The policemen and ambulance men wandered around wet and\r\nbewildered.\r\n\r\n"Resuscitator, resuscitator, anybody wanna resuscitator," chanted\r\nClarissa Willoughby.\r\n\r\n"Oh, shut up," said the ambulance attendants.\r\n\r\nNokomis, the bar man in the Plugged Nickel, called Clarence aside.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe, just for the moment, I\'d tell anyone what happened to\r\nthat fire plug," he said.\r\n\r\n"I won\'t tell if you won\'t tell," said Clarence.\r\n\r\nOfficer Comstock was suspicious. "There\'s only seven possible\r\nexplanations. One of the seven Willoughby kids did it. I dunno how.\r\nIt\'d take a bulldozer to do it, and then there\'d be something left of\r\nthe plug. But however they did it, one of them did it."\r\n\r\nOfficer Comstock had a talent for getting near the truth of dark\r\nmatters. This is why he was walking a beat out here in the boondocks\r\ninstead of sitting in a chair downtown.\r\n\r\n"Clarissa!" said Officer Comstock in a voice like thunder.\r\n\r\n"Resuscitator, resuscitator, anybody wanna resuscitator?" chanted\r\nClarissa.\r\n\r\n"Do you know what happened to that fire plug?" asked officer C.\r\n\r\n"I have an uncanny suspicion. As yet it is no more than that. 

When I am\r\nbetter informed I will advise you."\r\n\r\nClarissa was eight years old and much given to uncanny suspicions.\r\n\r\n"Clementine, Harold, Corinne, Jimmy, Cyril," he asked the five younger\r\nWilloughby children. "Do you know what happened to that fire plug?"\r\n\r\n"There was a man around yesterday. I bet he took it," said Clementine.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t even remember a fire plug there. I think you\'re making a lot\r\nof fuss about nothing," said Harold.\r\n\r\n"City hall\'s going to hear about this," said Corinne.\r\n\r\n"Pretty dommed sure," said Jimmy, "but I wont tell."\r\n\r\n"Cyril!" cried Officer Comstock in a terrible voice. Not a terrifying\r\nvoice, a terrible voice. He felt terrible now.\r\n\r\n"Great green bananas," said Cyril, "I\'m only three years old. I don\'t\r\nsee how it\'s even my responsibility."\r\n\r\n"Clarence," said Officer Comstock.\r\n\r\nClarence gulped.\r\n\r\n"Do you know where that fire plug went?"\r\n\r\nClarence brightened. 

"No, sir. 

I don\'t know where it went."\r\n\r\nA bunch of smart alecs from the water department came out and shut off\r\nthe water for a few blocks around and put some kind of cap on in place\r\nof the fire plug. "This sure is going to be a funny-sounding report,"\r\nsaid one of them.\r\n\r\nOfficer Comstock walked away discouraged. "Don\'t bother me, Miss\r\nManners," he said. "I don\'t know where to look for your cat. I don\'t\r\neven know where to look for a fire plug."\r\n\r\n"I have an idea," said Clarissa, "that when you find the cat you will\r\nfind the fire plug the same place. As yet it is only an idea."\r\n\r\nOzzie Murphy wore a little hat on top of his head. Clarence pointed\r\nhis weapon and winked. The hat was no longer there, but a little\r\ntrickle of blood was running down the pate.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe I\'d play with that any more," said Nokomis.\r\n\r\n"Who\'s playing?" said Clarence. 

"This is for real."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis was the beginning of the seven-day terror in the heretofore\r\nobscure neighborhood. Trees disappeared from the parkings; lamp posts\r\nwere as though they had never been; Wally Waldorf drove home, got out,\r\nslammed the door of his car, and there was no car. As George Mullendorf\r\ncame up the walk to his house his dog Pete ran to meet him and took\r\na flying leap to his arms. The dog left the sidewalk but something\r\nhappened; the dog was gone and only a bark lingered for a moment in the\r\npuzzled air.\r\n\r\nBut the worst were the fire plugs. The second plug was installed the\r\nmorning after the disappearance of the first. In eight minutes it\r\nwas gone and the flood waters returned. Another one was in by twelve\r\no\'clock. Within three minutes it had vanished. The next morning fire\r\nplug number four was installed.\r\n\r\nThe water commissioner was there, the city engineer was there, the\r\nchief of police was there with a riot squad, the president of the\r\nparent-teachers association was there, the president of the University\r\nwas there, the mayor was there, three gentlemen of the F.B.I., a\r\nnewsreel photographer, eminent scientists and a crowd of honest\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s see it disappear now," said the city engineer.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s see it disappear now," said the police chief.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s see it disa--it did, didn\'t it?" said one of the eminent\r\nscientists.\r\n\r\nAnd it was gone and everybody was very wet.\r\n\r\n"At least I have the picture sequence of the year," said the\r\nphotographer. But his camera and apparatus disappeared from the midst\r\nof them.\r\n\r\n"Shut off the water and cap it," said the commissioner. "And don\'t put\r\nin another plug yet. That was the last plug in the warehouse."\r\n\r\n"This is too big for me," said the mayor. "I wonder that Tass doesn\'t\r\nhave it yet."\r\n\r\n"Tass has it," said a little round man. "I am Tass."\r\n\r\n"If all of you gentlemen will come into the Plugged Nickel," said\r\nNokomis, "and try one of our new Fire Hydrant Highballs you will all be\r\nhappier. These are made of good corn whisky, brown sugar and hydrant\r\nwater from this very gutter. You can be the first to drink them."\r\n\r\nBusiness was phenomenal at the Plugged Nickel, for it was in front of\r\nits very doors that the fire plugs disappeared in floods of gushing\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n"I know a way we can get rich," said Clarissa several days later to her\r\nfather, Tom Willoughby. "Everybody says they\'re going to sell their\r\nhouses for nothing and move out of the neighborhood. Go get a lot of\r\nmoney and buy them all. Then you can sell them again and get rich."\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t buy them for a dollar each. Three of them have disappeared\r\nalready, and all the families but us have their furniture moved out\r\nin their front yards. There might be nothing but vacant lots in the\r\nmorning."\r\n\r\n"Good, then buy the vacant lots. And you can be ready when the houses\r\ncome back."\r\n\r\n"Come back? Are the houses going to come back? Do you know anything\r\nabout this, young lady?"\r\n\r\n"I have a suspicion verging on a certainty. 

As of now I can say no\r\nmore."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThree eminent scientists were gathered in an untidy suite that looked\r\nas though it belonged to a drunken sultan.\r\n\r\n"This transcends the meta-physical. It impinges on the quantum\r\ncontinuum. In some ways it obsoletes Boff," said Dr. Velikof Vonk.\r\n\r\n"The contingence on the intransigence is the most mystifying aspect,"\r\nsaid Arpad Arkabaranan.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Willy McGilly. "Who would have thought that you could do it\r\nwith a beer can and two pieces of cardboard? When I was a boy I used\r\nan oatmeal box and red crayola."\r\n\r\n"I do not always follow you," said Dr. Vonk. "I wish you would speak\r\nplainer."\r\n\r\nSo far no human had been injured or disappeared--except for a little\r\nblood on the pate of Ozzie Murphy, on the lobes of Conchita when her\r\ngaudy earrings disappeared from her very ears, a clipped finger or so\r\nwhen a house vanished as the front door knob was touched, a lost toe\r\nwhen a neighborhood boy kicked at a can and the can was not; probably\r\nnot more than a pint of blood and three or four ounces of flesh all\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nNow, however, Mr. Buckle the grocery man disappeared before witnesses.\r\nThis was serious.\r\n\r\nSome mean-looking investigators from downtown came out to the\r\nWilloughbys. The meanest-looking one was the mayor. In happier days he\r\nhad not been a mean man, but the terror had now reigned for seven days.\r\n\r\n"There have been ugly rumors," said one of the mean investigators,\r\n"that link certain events to this household. Do any of you know\r\nanything about them?

"\r\n\r\n"I started most of them," said Clarissa. "But I didn\'t consider them\r\nugly. Cryptic, rather. But if you want to get to the bottom of this\r\njust ask me a question."\r\n\r\n"Did you make those things disappear?" asked the investigator.\r\n\r\n"That isn\'t the question," said Clarissa.\r\n\r\n"Do you know where they have gone?" asked the investigator.\r\n\r\n"That isn\'t the question either," said Clarissa.\r\n\r\n"Can you make them come back?"\r\n\r\n"Why, of course I can. 

Anybody can. Can\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot. If you can, please do so at once."\r\n\r\n"I need some stuff. Get me a gold watch and a hammer. Then go down to\r\nthe drug store and get me this list of chemicals. And I need a yard of\r\nblack velvet and a pound of rock candy."\r\n\r\n"Shall we?" asked one of the investigators.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the mayor, "it\'s our only hope. Get her anything she wants."\r\n\r\nAnd it was all assembled.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Why does she get all the attention?" asked Clarence. "I was the one\r\nthat made all the things disappear. How does she know how to get them\r\nback?"\r\n\r\n"I knew it!" cried Clarissa with hate. "I knew he was the one that did\r\nit. He read in my diary how to make a disappearer. If I was his mother\r\nI\'d whip him for reading his little sister\'s diary. That\'s what happens\r\nwhen things like that fall into irresponsible hands."\r\n\r\nShe poised the hammer over the gold watch of the mayor on the floor.\r\n\r\n"I have to wait a few seconds. This can\'t be hurried. 

It\'ll be only a\r\nlittle while."\r\n\r\nThe second hand swept around to the point that was preordained for it\r\nbefore the world began. Clarissa suddenly brought down the hammer with\r\nall her force on the beautiful gold watch.\r\n\r\n"That\'s all," she said. "Your troubles are over. See, there is Blanche\r\nManners\' cat on the sidewalk just where she was seven days ago."\r\n\r\nAnd the cat was back.\r\n\r\n"Now let\'s go down to the Plugged Nickel and watch the fire plug come\r\nback."\r\n\r\nThey had only a few minutes to wait. It came from nowhere and clanged\r\ninto the street like a sign and a witness.\r\n\r\n"Now I predict," said Clarissa, "that every single object will return\r\nexactly seven days from the time of its disappearance."\r\n\r\nThe seven-day terror had ended. The objects began to reappear.\r\n\r\n"How," asked the mayor, "did you know they would come back in seven\r\ndays?"\r\n\r\n"Because it was a seven-day disappearer that Clarence made. I also know\r\nhow to make a nine-day, a thirteen-day, a twenty-seven-day, and an\r\neleven-year disappearer. I was going to make a thirteen-day one, but\r\nfor that you have to color the ends with the blood from a little boy\'s\r\nheart, and Cyril cried every time I tried to make a good cut."\r\n\r\n"You really know how to make all of these?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. 

But I shudder if the knowledge should ever come into unauthorized\r\nhands."\r\n\r\n"I shudder too, Clarissa. But tell me, why did you want the chemicals?"\r\n\r\n"For my chemistry set."\r\n\r\n"And the black velvet?"\r\n\r\n"For doll dresses."\r\n\r\n"And the pound of rock candy?"\r\n\r\n"How did you ever get to be mayor of this town if you have to ask\r\nquestions like that? What do you think I wanted the rock candy for?"\r\n\r\n"One last question," said the mayor. "Why did you smash my gold watch\r\nwith the hammer?"\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Clarissa, "that was for dramatic effect."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


Not\r\njust the title or the preface, or a page somewhere in the middle. He\r\nwanted to read the whole thing, all the way through from beginning to\r\nend. A simple ambition perhaps, but in the cluttered life of Henry\r\nBemis, an impossibility.\r\n\r\nHenry had no time of his own. There was his wife, Agnes who owned that\r\npart of it that his employer, Mr. Carsville, did not buy. Henry was\r\nallowed enough to get to and from work--that in itself being quite a\r\nconcession on Agnes\' part.\r\n\r\nAlso, nature had conspired against Henry by handing him with a pair of\r\nhopelessly myopic eyes. Poor Henry literally couldn\'t see his hand in\r\nfront of his face. For a while, when he was very young, his parents\r\nhad thought him an idiot. When they realized it was his eyes, they got\r\nglasses for him. He was never quite able to catch up. 

There was never\r\nenough time. It looked as though Henry\'s ambition would never be\r\nrealized. Then something happened which changed all that.\r\n\r\nHenry was down in the vault of the Eastside Bank & Trust when it\r\nhappened. He had stolen a few moments from the duties of his teller\'s\r\ncage to try to read a few pages of the magazine he had bought that\r\nmorning. He\'d made an excuse to Mr. Carsville about needing bills in\r\nlarge denominations for a certain customer, and then, safe inside the\r\ndim recesses of the vault he had pulled from inside his coat the\r\npocket size magazine.\r\n\r\nHe had just started a picture article cheerfully entitled "The New\r\nWeapons and What They\'ll Do To YOU", when all the noise in the world\r\ncrashed in upon his ear-drums. It seemed to be inside of him and\r\noutside of him all at once. Then the concrete floor was rising up at\r\nhim and the ceiling came slanting down toward him, and for a fleeting\r\nsecond Henry thought of a story he had started to read once called\r\n"The Pit and The Pendulum". He regretted in that insane moment that he\r\nhad never had time to finish that story to see how it came out. Then\r\nall was darkness and quiet and unconsciousness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Henry came to, he knew that something was desperately wrong with\r\nthe Eastside Bank & Trust. The heavy steel door of the vault was\r\nbuckled and twisted and the floor tilted up at a dizzy angle, while\r\nthe ceiling dipped crazily toward it. Henry gingerly got to his feet,\r\nmoving arms and legs experimentally. Assured that nothing was broken,\r\nhe tenderly raised a hand to his eyes. His precious glasses were\r\nintact, thank God! He would never have been able to find his way out\r\nof the shattered vault without them.\r\n\r\nHe made a mental note to write Dr. Torrance to have a spare pair made\r\nand mailed to him. Blasted nuisance not having his prescription on\r\nfile locally, but Henry trusted no-one but Dr. Torrance to grind those\r\nthick lenses into his own complicated prescription. Henry removed the\r\nheavy glasses from his face. Instantly the room dissolved into a\r\nneutral blur. Henry saw a pink splash that he knew was his hand, and a\r\nwhite blob come up to meet the pink as he withdrew his pocket\r\nhandkerchief and carefully dusted the lenses. As he replaced the\r\nglasses, they slipped down on the bridge of his nose a little. He had\r\nbeen meaning to have them tightened for some time.\r\n\r\nHe suddenly realized, without the realization actually entering his\r\nconscious thoughts, that something momentous had happened, something\r\nworse than the boiler blowing up, something worse than a gas main\r\nexploding, something worse than anything that had ever happened\r\nbefore. He felt that way because it was so quiet. There was no whine\r\nof sirens, no shouting, no running, just an ominous and all pervading\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHenry walked across the slanting floor. Slipping and stumbling on the\r\nuneven surface, he made his way to the elevator. The car lay crumpled\r\nat the foot of the shaft like a discarded accordian. There was\r\nsomething inside of it that Henry could not look at, something that\r\nhad once been a person, or perhaps several people, it was impossible\r\nto tell now.\r\n\r\nFeeling sick, Henry staggered toward the stairway. The steps were\r\nstill there, but so jumbled and piled back upon one another that it\r\nwas more like climbing the side of a mountain than mounting a\r\nstairway. It was quiet in the huge chamber that had been the lobby of\r\nthe bank. It looked strangely cheerful with the sunlight shining\r\nthrough the girders where the ceiling had fallen. The dappled sunlight\r\nglinted across the silent lobby, and everywhere there were huddled\r\nlumps of unpleasantness that made Henry sick as he tried not to look\r\nat them.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Carsville," he called. It was very quiet. 

Something had to be\r\ndone, of course. This was terrible, right in the middle of a Monday,\r\ntoo. Mr. Carsville would know what to do. He called again, more\r\nloudly, and his voice cracked hoarsely, "Mr. Carrrrsville!" And then\r\nhe saw an arm and shoulder extending out from under a huge fallen\r\nblock of marble ceiling. In the buttonhole was the white carnation Mr.\r\nCarsville had worn to work that morning, and on the third finger of\r\nthat hand was a massive signet ring, also belonging to Mr. Carsville.\r\nNumbly, Henry realized that the rest of Mr. Carsville was under that\r\nblock of marble.\r\n\r\nHenry felt a pang of real sorrow. Mr. Carsville was gone, and so was\r\nthe rest of the staff--Mr. Wilkinson and Mr. 

Emory and Mr. 

Prithard,\r\nand the same with Pete and Ralph and Jenkins and Hunter and Pat the\r\nguard and Willie the doorman. There was no one to say what was to be\r\ndone about the Eastside Bank & Trust except Henry Bemis, and Henry\r\nwasn\'t worried about the bank, there was something he wanted to do.\r\n\r\nHe climbed carefully over piles of fallen masonry. Once he stepped\r\ndown into something that crunched and squashed beneath his feet and he\r\nset his teeth on edge to keep from retching. The street was not much\r\ndifferent from the inside, bright sunlight and so much concrete to\r\ncrawl over, but the unpleasantness was much, much worse. Everywhere\r\nthere were strange, motionless lumps that Henry could not look at.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, he remembered Agnes. He should be trying to get to Agnes,\r\nshouldn\'t he? He remembered a poster he had seen that said, "In event\r\nof emergency do not use the telephone, your loved ones are as safe as\r\nyou." He wondered about Agnes. He looked at the smashed automobiles,\r\nsome with their four wheels pointing skyward like the stiffened legs\r\nof dead animals. He couldn\'t get to Agnes now anyway, if she was safe,\r\nthen, she was safe, otherwise ... of course, Henry knew Agnes wasn\'t\r\nsafe. He had a feeling that there wasn\'t anyone safe for a long, long\r\nway, maybe not in the whole state or the whole country, or the whole\r\nworld. No, that was a thought Henry didn\'t want to think, he forced it\r\nfrom his mind and turned his thoughts back to Agnes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShe had been a pretty good wife, now that it was all said and done. It\r\nwasn\'t exactly her fault if people didn\'t have time to read nowadays.\r\nIt was just that there was the house, and the bank, and the yard.\r\nThere were the Jones\' for bridge and the Graysons\' for canasta and\r\ncharades with the Bryants. And the television, the television Agnes\r\nloved to watch, but would never watch alone. He never had time to read\r\neven a newspaper. He started thinking about last night, that business\r\nabout the newspaper.\r\n\r\nHenry had settled into his chair, quietly, afraid that a creaking\r\nspring might call to Agnes\' attention the fact that he was momentarily\r\nunoccupied. He had unfolded the newspaper slowly and carefully, the\r\nsharp crackle of the paper would have been a clarion call to Agnes. He\r\nhad glanced at the headlines of the first page. "Collapse Of\r\nConference Imminent." He didn\'t have time to read the article. He\r\nturned to the second page. "Solon Predicts War Only Days Away." He\r\nflipped through the pages faster, reading brief snatches here and\r\nthere, afraid to spend too much time on any one item. On a back page\r\nwas a brief article entitled, "Prehistoric Artifacts Unearthed In\r\nYucatan". Henry smiled to himself and carefully folded the sheet of\r\npaper into fourths. 

That would be interesting, he would read all of\r\nit. Then it came, Agnes\' voice. "Henrrreee!" 

And then she was upon\r\nhim. She lightly flicked the paper out of his hands and into the\r\nfireplace. He saw the flames lick up and curl possessively around the\r\nunread article. Agnes continued, "Henry, tonight is the Jones\' bridge\r\nnight. They\'ll be here in thirty minutes and I\'m not dressed yet, and\r\nhere you are ... 

_reading_." She had emphasized the last word as\r\nthough it were an unclean act. "Hurry and shave, you know how smooth\r\nJasper Jones\' chin always looks, and then straighten up this room."\r\nShe glanced regretfully toward the fireplace. "Oh dear, that paper,\r\nthe television schedule ... oh well, after the Jones leave there won\'t\r\nbe time for anything but the late-late movie and.... Don\'t just sit\r\nthere, Henry, hurrreeee!"\r\n\r\nHenry was hurrying now, but hurrying too much. He cut his leg on a\r\ntwisted piece of metal that had once been an automobile fender. He\r\nthought about things like lock-jaw and gangrene and his hand trembled\r\nas he tied his pocket-handkerchief around the wound. In his mind, he\r\nsaw the fire again, licking across the face of last night\'s newspaper.\r\nHe thought that now he would have time to read all the newspapers he\r\nwanted to, only now there wouldn\'t be any more. That heap of rubble\r\nacross the street had been the Gazette Building. It was terrible to\r\nthink there would never be another up to date newspaper. Agnes would\r\nhave been very upset, no television schedule. But then, of course, no\r\ntelevision. 

He wanted to laugh but he didn\'t. That wouldn\'t have been\r\nfitting, not at all.\r\n\r\nHe could see the building he was looking for now, but the silhouette\r\nwas strangely changed. The great circular dome was now a ragged\r\nsemi-circle, half of it gone, and one of the great wings of the\r\nbuilding had fallen in upon itself. A sudden panic gripped Henry\r\nBemis. What if they were all ruined, destroyed, every one of them?\r\nWhat if there wasn\'t a single one left? Tears of helplessness welled\r\nin his eyes as he painfully fought his way over and through the\r\ntwisted fragments of the city.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe thought of the building when it had been whole. He remembered the\r\nmany nights he had paused outside its wide and welcoming doors. He\r\nthought of the warm nights when the doors had been thrown open and he\r\ncould see the people inside, see them sitting at the plain wooden\r\ntables with the stacks of books beside them. He used to think then,\r\nwhat a wonderful thing a public library was, a place where anybody,\r\nanybody at all could go in and read.\r\n\r\nHe had been tempted to enter many times. He had watched the people\r\nthrough the open doors, the man in greasy work clothes who sat near\r\nthe door, night after night, laboriously studying, a technical journal\r\nperhaps, difficult for him, but promising a brighter future. There had\r\nbeen an aged, scholarly gentleman who sat on the other side of the\r\ndoor, leisurely paging, moving his lips a little as he did so, a man\r\nhaving little time left, but rich in time because he could do with it\r\nas he chose.\r\n\r\nHenry had never gone in. He had started up the steps once, got almost\r\nto the door, but then he remembered Agnes, her questions and shouting,\r\nand he had turned away.\r\n\r\nHe was going in now though, almost crawling, his breath coming in\r\nstabbing gasps, his hands torn and bleeding. His trouser leg was\r\nsticky red where the wound in his leg had soaked through the\r\nhandkerchief. It was throbbing badly but Henry didn\'t care. He had\r\nreached his destination.\r\n\r\nPart of the inscription was still there, over the now doorless\r\nentrance. P-U-B--C L-I-B-R---. The rest had been torn away. The place\r\nwas in shambles. The shelves were overturned, broken, smashed, tilted,\r\ntheir precious contents spilled in disorder upon the floor. A lot of\r\nthe books, Henry noted gleefully, were still intact, still whole,\r\nstill readable. He was literally knee deep in them, he wallowed in\r\nbooks. He picked one up. The title was "Collected Works of William\r\nShakespeare." Yes, he must read that, sometime. He laid it aside\r\ncarefully. He picked up another. Spinoza. He tossed it away, seized\r\nanother, and another, and still another. 

Which to read first ... there\r\nwere so many.\r\n\r\nHe had been conducting himself a little like a starving man in a\r\ndelicatessen--grabbing a little of this and a little of that in a\r\nfrenzy of enjoyment.\r\n\r\nBut now he steadied away. From the pile about him, he selected one\r\nvolume, sat comfortably down on an overturned shelf, and opened the\r\nbook.\r\n\r\nHenry Bemis smiled.\r\n\r\nThere was the rumble of complaining stone. Minute in comparison with\r\nthe epic complaints following the fall of the bomb. This one occurred\r\nunder one corner of the shelf upon which Henry sat. 

The shelf moved;\r\nthrew him off balance. The glasses slipped from his nose and fell with\r\na tinkle.\r\n\r\nHe bent down, clawing blindly and found, finally, their smashed\r\nremains. A minor, indirect destruction stemming from the sudden,\r\nwholesale smashing of a city. But the only one that greatly interested\r\nHenry Bemis.\r\n\r\nHe stared down at the blurred page before him.\r\n\r\nHe began to cry.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE END\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\n_You better take your money back, mister. Thanks a lot but--no thanks.\r\nI wasn\'t panhandling, my hat fell off and I was trying to find it on\r\nthe sidewalk. Thanks again for finding it for me but I think I could\r\nhave managed. 

And, no offense, but I can find my way all right without\r\nbeing led._\r\n\r\n_You\'re surprised that I\'m rather young, huh? Well, youth isn\'t a\r\ncrime and anyways, twenty-four can be either young or old, depending on\r\nwho you\'re talking to. But I know what you mean. I\'m rather young for\r\nbeing blind, isn\'t that it? Most blind people you see on the streets\r\nare the old ones, the shabby ones with the pleading faces and the hat\r\nwith the lead pencils in it or maybe a tin cup and a violin. Sorry to\r\ndisappoint you but I guess I\'m not the type._\r\n\r\n_Sure, I know--you were only trying to help. You probably think I\'m\r\nbitter because I can\'t see your world and all the wonderful things in\r\nit. Well, it\'s a long story but that\'s not the punch line. I might be\r\nbitter but not for the reasons you might think. Up until two weeks\r\nago I could see as well as you. And you couldn\'t call what happened\r\n"losing" my sight. Not exactly._\r\n\r\n_So you\'re curious. 

You want to hear the rest of it. And you\'re sure\r\nit\'s not just out of sympathy. 

Well, all right. There\'s a bar in the\r\nnext block where we can get a booth and a couple of beers._\r\n\r\n_Now look, I don\'t need to be led! You don\'t need eyes to find your\r\nway to a bar on a hot summer day like this. It\'s toward the end of the\r\nblock, just a few steps further.... Right here. There\'s a booth in the\r\nback where nobody will bother us for a while._\r\n\r\n_Okay, make mine the same and here\'s half a dollar to pay for them.\r\nDon\'t worry, I\'ve got money enough to keep me in beer and pretzels for\r\na long time. Nobody could accuse the professor of being stingy with the\r\nuniversity funds when he paid me off._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt began about six months ago. I was in my third year at college,\r\nstudying physics under Professor Martin. Maybe you\'ve seen Martin\r\naround the campus--a rather thin guy with a face like the Rock of\r\nGibraltar. One of the few profs who can still sound enthusiastic about\r\ntheir subject after twenty years of teaching it.\r\n\r\nThe unit we were studying at the time was the one on light and physical\r\noptics, primarily a study of the spectrum stretching from x-rays beyond\r\nthe ultra-violet to the visible spectrum, down to the infra-red and\r\nradio waves and the short waves used in television and radar. I had\r\nbeen absent from class a week and on my return the professor invited me\r\nto dinner. After the dishes had been cleared away he leaned back in his\r\nchair and lit what I took to be his usual after dinner cigar.\r\n\r\n"I like to meet my students informally, Charles," he began. "Sorry that\r\nyour wife couldn\'t come but I understand she\'s ... well...." He let the\r\nsentence trail off.\r\n\r\nI sat there feeling rather sick. It\'s one of those things you hope\r\neverybody has heard about so you don\'t have to explain, to sit and\r\ntake their looks of pity and sympathy. Apparently the professor hadn\'t\r\nheard. "I\'m sorry," I said. 

"I thought you knew. Both Alice and the\r\nbaby died."\r\n\r\nThe hand he held his cigar in quivered a little. 

"I\'m sorry," he said,\r\nand mercifully dropped it there. Then he changed the subject to the one\r\nhe had in mind when he had asked me to dinner.\r\n\r\n"Light, Charles, is such a large subject--and, comparatively speaking,\r\nso little is known about it. But perhaps--perhaps I know more than\r\nmost. And if you wish, you can too. Would you like to see the world you\r\nlive in, Charles? Not just the one tenth of one percent that they call\r\nthe visible spectrum, but all of it, the whole glorious universe of\r\nlight?"\r\n\r\nHe took me into his confidence on his favorite research project, an\r\nattempt to see wavelengths other than those in the visible spectrum.\r\nHis enthusiasm was catching and there wasn\'t much hesitation. I signed\r\nthe paper releasing the university from all responsibility in case\r\nof an "accident." So easy to sign one\'s life away--though it wasn\'t\r\nactually my life, only my eyesight.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe treatments began immediately. First, adaptation of vision to a\r\ndark room, like those used for flyers during the war. Then the drops\r\nof black liquid that the professor had invented, slowly spreading over\r\nthe eyes, subtly altering the rods and cones of the retina, the nerve\r\nendings sensitive to light.\r\n\r\nAnd I began to live in a gradually fading world. Have you ever wondered\r\nwhat it\'s like to go blind? The increasing dusk and darkness around the\r\nedges of your vision, the little errors and mistakes that begin to crop\r\nup in everyday life. Your blunder over a stool that you didn\'t quite\r\nsee, your snubbing someone on the street whom you didn\'t recognize in\r\ntime, the gradual awareness among your friends that something was\r\nwrong with your eyes and their crude attempts to make it "easier" for\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nFor to all intents and purposes I was going blind. My "range" of vision\r\nremained the same but it was shifting down the scale. The first colors\r\nto fade out of my vision were violet and blue and their tints. The sky\r\noverhead gradually became colorless, magazine covers began to lose\r\ntheir appeal and slip into a bleak blending of yellows and reds. Then\r\nslowly, the other colors began to grow dim and less distinct until\r\nfinally even red had faded from my sight.\r\n\r\nBut there were other colors that replaced them. Brilliant,\r\nscintillating colors that made seeing an adventure.\r\n\r\nDescribe them to you? How could you describe "red" and "green" to a\r\nperson who was blind from birth? How can I describe iridescent and\r\nvliosheen to you? Do you think you could understand? Do you think you\r\ncould "see" what I mean?\r\n\r\nOh, I could still get around in your world. I could still "see" people.\r\nAll objects radiate heat, even ice. As an object\'s temperature goes up,\r\nthe wavelength of the radiation given off goes up to the infra-red,\r\nthen into the visible. I could tell how hot water was by looking at it.\r\nI could see people by the heat they gave off, glowing figures moving\r\ndown the street and around the lab!\r\n\r\nAnd still my range of vision shifted. Down to short waves and radio\r\nwaves, the language of international communication, the wavelengths\r\nthat continents and countries speak to each other in. Do you know how\r\nbeautiful the aerial of your radio is, the different waves running down\r\nit like ripples across a pond? Have you ever seen the glorious pool\r\nof light around a radio broadcasting station? Have you ever marveled\r\nat the thin, trailing filaments of color tangling in the nest of\r\ntelevision antennas that the city carries on its rooftops?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe professor was worried, for along with losing my sight of this\r\nworld, I began to lose interest in it. A truly blind man wouldn\'t\r\nfor he has nothing to replace vision with, he\'s still bound to the\r\ncommonplace globe. He can improve his hearing or his sense of touch,\r\nbut nothing replaces his sight. It was different with me. I was seeing\r\nsomething far more interesting than the dull, mundane world.\r\n\r\nThey fixed a cot up for me in the laboratory; an experiment like myself\r\nwas far too important to risk on the streets. Even then, I\'d bump into\r\ntables or smash lab apparatus. I suppose an important experiment like I\r\nwas should have taken care of itself, sort of like a self-lubricating\r\nmotor. I\'d cost the university lots of money and I suppose I should\r\nhave watched out for their investment--though I was probably the only\r\none who _didn\'t_ care what happened to me.\r\n\r\nThere finally came a day when my eyes didn\'t change. I had reached a\r\nsticking point. The end of the spectrum? The professor said he didn\'t\r\nthink so.\r\n\r\nI didn\'t think so either for just beyond my range of vision seemed a\r\nhint of something else. I caught "glimpses" of something--I couldn\'t\r\nmake out exactly what. There seemed to be vague suggestions of form\r\nand color and life, indistinct figures that capered and grimaced just\r\nbeyond my view. There was nothing definite, nothing that I could draw\r\na picture of and describe like you could an automobile or a building.\r\nThere were just suggestions, a feeling of something more. There was a\r\nhint of life in the masses of winking light that beckoned and burned.\r\n\r\nThe next day the professor brought my eyes back to normal. Familiar\r\nobjects had a sudden fascination that quickly faded when I had regained\r\nnormal vision for an hour or so. It was a prosaic world once again.\r\nRadios and aerials were just--cabinets of wood and plastic and glass\r\ntubes and strips of rusty wire and metal.\r\n\r\nI wasn\'t sure the experiment was over. I asked the professor if there\r\nwas anything that would take me further along the scale, beyond,\r\nperhaps, even the spectrum as we knew it.\r\n\r\nHe twisted his hands nervously behind his back and walked over and\r\nlooked out the laboratory window. "I could do it for you, Charles, but\r\nI\'m not sure that I could bring you back. Your eyes would be stranded\r\nin that world of yours. 

You could never look at ours again."\r\n\r\nHe turned from the window and faced me.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you forget it for a few weeks and then come back here and if\r\nyou still want to, we\'ll continue the experiment."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI agreed and left. I spent the next two weeks doing nothing but looking\r\nat our world. Do you think you really appreciate your sight? If you\r\nknew you had but a few weeks of sight left, what would you do with it?\r\nVisit famous landmarks? See the country? 

If you thought about it, I\r\nthink you\'d do the same as I did. I began to enjoy what was close at\r\nhand, the surroundings I had lived in. Everyday sights held a certain\r\nfascination for me. The stark black and white mosaic of a city at the\r\ntag end of winter; the sheer, raucous color of the magazines at your\r\nlocal newsstand; the smooth patterns of hues and tints in a department\r\nstore window display.\r\n\r\nAnd how much do you appreciate springtime? The few weeks of the year\r\nwhen the city loses its look of drabness and little plots of grass and\r\nflowers add color to it--like brilliant strips of cloth in a dirty\r\npatchwork quilt. Then there were the kids roller skating down the\r\nsidewalks, the girls\' pigtails flying and the boys\' knickers flapping\r\nin the breeze. And later on, in the business blocks, the soft glow of\r\nneon against the swirling fog of a warm spring night.\r\n\r\nThat was the last spring I\'ll ever see. I\'ll be able to smell the\r\nflowers and feel the warmth of the sun and run my fingers through the\r\ngreen grass. But I\'ll never see it again.\r\n\r\nAfter the few weeks were up I returned to the professor--still curious\r\nabout what lay beyond the spectrum limits. There were the eye washes\r\nand the drops and then the heavy strips of white cloth wrapped around\r\nmy head, keeping your world out and bounding mine with a rim of black.\r\nMy last look at the world was of some kids playing in the city streets,\r\nand some bread crumbs spread out on the window sill for the birds.\r\nAfter that a quick view of the lab--a jungle of glass retorts and vats\r\nfilled with oily chemicals--and a closeup of Professor Martin\'s gnarled\r\nhands holding the bandages for my eyes.\r\n\r\nI lay on the cot in the lab for the next few days, listening to your\r\nworld and feeling it and remembering it; the good and the bad, the\r\nadventuresome and the dull. I could hear the newsboy hawking his papers\r\nand the shouts of the kids and the clatter of the main street trolley.\r\nI could smell the factory smoke and the heavy, animal odor drifting up\r\nfrom the stockyards. I could hear the people in the lab and Professor\r\nMartin scurrying about, asking me how I felt, and toward the end,\r\ntelling me that in a few hours the bandages would come off.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks ago the professor came into the lab and started tearing at\r\nthe adhesive, stripping away the layers of white cloth. Even when he\r\nhad the bandages all the way off, I kept my eyes closed, almost afraid\r\nto open them.\r\n\r\nMy eyes had to focus first. Everything was so damned brilliant and\r\nindistinct. Then my sight cleared and suddenly everything was very\r\nplain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Well, that\'s about it. There isn\'t much more to tell. 

It hasn\'t been\r\ntoo boring to listen to me for fifteen minutes, has it? I can tell you\r\nhaven\'t been too bored because you haven\'t touched your beer, have you?\r\nIt\'s getting warm--and you know what they say about warm beer...._\r\n\r\n_What did I see? You really want to know, don\'t you?_\r\n\r\n_Well, I\'ve tried to rationalize it and explain it and I suppose I\r\ncan, in a dim way. 

Put it this way: I\'m totally blind now. What\'s\r\nbright to you is black to me. But I\'m not bitter because I can\'t see_\r\nyour _world. And I can\'t describe to you what I saw because, you see, I\r\ndon\'t remember. 

Perhaps it\'s merciful, I don\'t know. I can only guess\r\nfrom what the professor told me._\r\n\r\n_Professor Martin had stripped the bandages from my eyes and he and a\r\nfew assistants saw my eyes blur and finally focus on something in a\r\ndifferent world from theirs. And then, before I fainted, I screamed the\r\none word that none of them would ever forget._\r\n\r\n"_ALICE!_"\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Washington was the father of his country.\r\n\r\nI am not George Washington. My name is Andrew Jones, and it is because\r\nof me there will be no more Joneses in the world. There will be, in\r\nfact, no more anybody.\r\n\r\nThis is the end of the world.\r\n\r\nIt did not come through fire or ice, with a bang or a whimper, from\r\nsolar catastrophe or man\'s suicidal mis-use of atomic power or any\r\nof the other fearful possibilities with which the Sunday-supplement\r\nwriters once terrified us. It came through the exposure of an age-old\r\nconspiracy.\r\n\r\nI did it. My excuse is the eternal excuse of the scientist: I sought\r\nthe truth. How it was used was not my concern.\r\n\r\nBut that it should have led to the depopulation of the Earth concerns\r\nme, as it must concern every man, and I have an unshakable feeling of\r\nguilt.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I write this now in the hope that I may somehow purge myself. I\r\nknow that it will never be read.\r\n\r\nThe linen wick gutters in the saucer of melted tallow. 

It casts strange\r\nshadows on the cellar wall. Sometimes I think that they are the ghosts\r\nof children come to haunt me, the ghosts of all the little children who\r\nwill never be born.\r\n\r\nBut this is not what I sat down to write while I waited for Lindsay to\r\nreturn. What is keeping Lindsay? He should be back by now.\r\n\r\nI will begin again.\r\n\r\nMy name is Andrew Jones, and today, by my figures, is October 3, 1969.\r\nThe weather is turning cold here, and soon we must go looking for\r\nanother hiding place. My joints are getting old; the damp has seeped\r\ninto them. I long for the year-long warmth of California or Florida,\r\nbut those areas are still crowded and deadly.\r\n\r\nSomeone would recognize me.\r\n\r\nI think we will try a powerhouse again this winter. Often they have\r\nsupplies of coal large enough to last us through the cold weather\r\nwithout extra foraging.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCataclysm began in 1954, June 13 to be exact. That was the day my\r\nsecond child was born, a boy we named Kevin.\r\n\r\nIt is surprising that a man who was the father of two children should\r\naccuse himself of depopulating the Earth. And yet it is because I was\r\nthe father of two children that it happened.\r\n\r\nPre-natal care of mothers and post-natal care of infants were\r\nsubjects of compelling interest in those days, arriving monthly in\r\nthe burgeoning women\'s magazines and annually in the proliferous\r\nchild-care manuals. Pediatricians and mothers besieged parents with\r\nadvice, and we consumed everything with catholic appetite: logical,\r\nillogical, sensible, insensible, nonsensical, self-contradictory.\r\n\r\nThey kept us on our toes, strung as taut as Stradivarius violins,\r\nafraid to act for fear we would do the wrong thing, afraid not to act\r\nfor fear inaction would be disastrous. Pediatricians and mothers,\r\nalways the same authors. Never were there any articles on the care of\r\nmother and child by a father, only by what I came to think of as the\r\nvested interests.\r\n\r\nI was slow, I admit; but what father has not been slow? Who, if he had\r\nnot been slow, would be a father?\r\n\r\nThe books and the articles would have been troublesome enough if the\r\ninformation they imparted had been accurate. But slowly I became aware\r\nthat they were subtly interwoven with mis-statements.\r\n\r\nI raveled them out, I categorized them. I counted five different kinds\r\nbefore I convinced myself.\r\n\r\nA mother published this: "One baby takes up all your time--two can\'t\r\ntake any more."\r\n\r\nThe fallacy was obvious. A certain amount of housework was inescapable.\r\nIf the mother was unable to do the work, what happened to it?\r\n\r\nAnswer: somebody else did it.\r\n\r\nWho? Even in the abundance of those days, most of us couldn\'t afford\r\nnurses, maids, cooks, laundresses, or cleaning women. The era of the\r\npoor relation who came to help out for a few months was long past.\r\n\r\nWho did the work, then? The father, that\'s who.\r\n\r\nI stared deep into the shocking chasm between the mental processes of\r\nmen and women.\r\n\r\nI studied the statement again. There was no mis-statement at all--if\r\nyou granted the hidden premise and didn\'t boggle on the implication. It\r\nwas perfectly valid.\r\n\r\nThe hidden premise was that women did all the housework. But that\r\nhadn\'t been true for a generation. The husband-father had been drafted\r\ninto home service, and there was no discharge for him short of death or\r\ntotal disability.\r\n\r\nThe latter was hard to prove.\r\n\r\nBut the implication was the deadly thing: in the consideration of\r\nsecond child, a father\'s time and labor counted for nothing.\r\n\r\nI remembered a shaggy little story about a farmer who held up his hog\r\nto let it eat the corn off the stalk. "Doesn\'t it take a long time to\r\nfatten up a hog that way?" exclaimed the efficiency expert.\r\n\r\n"Shore," said the farmer, "but what\'s time to a hog?"\r\n\r\nAnd what, in a woman\'s eyes, was time to a father?\r\n\r\nThe second type of mis-statement was a pure omission. The thing\r\nthe baby books didn\'t mention was that most women felt ten times\r\nworse during their second pregnancies.[1] At this time life became\r\nalmost unbearable for them--and it was, as a consequence, completely\r\nunbearable for their husbands.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: Editor\'s note: This may help explain the size of the\r\n    average American family: 1.6 children.--W. M.

]\r\n\r\nNot one baby book or article mentioned that fact. That it was a fact I\r\nproved by a personal survey. Every mother questioned revealed that she\r\nfelt horrible during her second pregnancy. She was surprised that my\r\nwife and I didn\'t know this.\r\n\r\nI was not surprised. 

Nobody ever mentioned it, that is why we didn\'t\r\nknow. I think it was at this time I first asked myself: _Is there a\r\nsubconscious conspiracy to keep this kind of information from leaking\r\nout?_\r\n\r\nIt wasn\'t important that women didn\'t know this. They had selective\r\nmemories (proof of this was that mankind lasted as long as it did).\r\nIf they were maternally inclined (as most of them were at one time or\r\nanother), the disadvantages of pregnancy faded into a sort of merciful\r\nblur.\r\n\r\nIf there was a conspiracy, it was aimed at fathers. It was intended to\r\nlull them into the logical supposition that conditions usually improve\r\nand that experience is the great teacher. 

Pure delusion! With women,\r\nthings are always worse, and they are born with all the knowledge they\r\nwill ever need.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBabies could be divided into two kinds: "most" and "occasional."\r\nConsider, for instance, the following quotation: "Most babies in the\r\nearly months sleep from feeding to feeding; an occasional baby won\'t\r\nfall into this pattern but insists on being sociable after his meals."\r\n\r\nThe first time I read that I supposed that this business of "most" and\r\n"occasional" was a statistical matter. That was my fatal mistake. If\r\nthere was any statistical backing for that statement, I never found it.\r\n\r\nIn my experience, the chances were nine out of ten that--try as you\r\nwould--you would have an "occasional" baby.\r\n\r\nWe did. We had two of them.\r\n\r\nThe fourth type of mis-statement was the false generalization. It was\r\nsaid, much too often: "A full baby is a sleepy baby."\r\n\r\nThat is a re-statement of the quotation above.\r\n\r\nI sat down with a pencil and paper and figured it out. A small infant\r\ntook half an hour to finish a bottle. If he ate five times a day, he\r\nwould have spent 21-1/2 hours asleep out of every 24.\r\n\r\nA little farther on I would read something like: "If a baby wakes up\r\nearly, he is not getting enough to eat." I drew up a schedule:\r\n\r\n    _Baby wakes up (being hungry)._\r\n\r\n    _Baby gets fed (all he can hold)._\r\n\r\n    _Baby is sleepy (being fed)._\r\n\r\n    _Baby goes to sleep (being sleepy)._\r\n\r\n    _Baby sleeps until next feeding (being full)._\r\n\r\nI didn\'t recognize the baby. Who could? 

He wasn\'t my child or anybody\r\nelse\'s. He was the pediatrician\'s pipe-dream child.\r\n\r\nI looked at it another way: if the baby slept except when being\r\nfed, when did it get the baths, orange juice, vitamins, cereal, and\r\neverything else the pediatricians prescribed?\r\n\r\nHoist by their own petards!\r\n\r\nThe fifth type of mis-statement was the impossible ideal. I tried this\r\none for logic: "Babies should not be allowed to cry before feeding."[2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: Editor\'s note: This led to swallowing air which made\r\n    gas bubbles; gas bubbles caused colic.--W. M.]\r\n\r\nHad those doctors ever tried to keep a hungry child from crying?\r\n\r\nHungry children cried. It was their nature. Some of them--my kind for\r\ninstance--cried very hard. And children--even pipe-dream children--woke\r\nup hungry.\r\n\r\nWarming a bottle to drinkable temperature took time, at least five\r\nminutes and sometimes ten. Meanwhile, in spite of everything that\r\nanyone could do, the baby was crying. He would not he cajoled, walked,\r\nteased, patted, jollied, scolded, or argued into accepting any\r\nsubstitute for his formula. With him, it was food or nothing.\r\n\r\nFor horror, I had a favorite scene: the mother alone, rushing from\r\nbaby to bottle, from bottle to baby, one screaming, the other cold,\r\nfrantic with the pediatrician\'s admonitions, and then both too hot....\r\n\r\nI would not have had it on my conscience for all the royalties in\r\nAmerica! At least I have saved the world that.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere were more mis-statements, but those were enough. 

I did what any\r\nman, any scientist, would have done. I gave my findings to the world.\r\nThey were published under the title: "What the Baby Books Won\'t Tell\r\nYou." The article stirred up immediate controversy.\r\n\r\nIt is not enough to uncover a conspiracy; you must find a motive. I had\r\ndiscovered the motive behind the Great Conspiracy.\r\n\r\nBaby books were not written to teach parents how to care for their\r\nchildren; baby books were written to sell baby books. And magazines\r\npublished articles about babies to sell magazines to mothers.\r\n\r\nValid reasons. If they had not existed, there would have been no baby\r\nbooks, no women\'s magazines. But this had far-reaching consequences:\r\nthe market for baby books and women\'s magazines was the great,\r\nproliferating population of new parents. If the awful truth about\r\nparenthood were published, if these hardy, ingenuous souls were\r\ndiscouraged, something quite startling would happen to the market: it\r\nwould disappear.\r\n\r\nThere were attempts at suppression on all levels, but the truth was out\r\nand nothing could stop its spread. Secret printing presses turned out\r\nreprints by the millions; they were passed from hand to hand. Fathers\r\nwhispered the word to husbands; husbands passed it on to bachelor\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nThe word raced around the world.\r\n\r\nIt would not have been so disastrous if Lindsay McPherson had not\r\nsimultaneously perfected his contraceptive pill out of a Southwestern\r\nplant named _Lithospermum ruderale_. For the first time, a\r\ncontraceptive was safe, cheap, and convenient--and 100% effective in\r\nreducing _male_ fertility.\r\n\r\nBirth control was in the hands of the men.\r\n\r\nBillions of the tiny pills were turned out. Enemy nations sowed them\r\nover each other\'s territory in boxes containing translations of my\r\narticle. Men cached them away, carried them in money belts, hollowed\r\nout hiding places in the heels of shoes....\r\n\r\nBirths dropped suddenly. Almost overnight, the maternity wards were\r\ndepopulated. Hospitals went broke, or began advertising for patrons,\r\nsick or well.\r\n\r\nThe makers of baby foods, baby apparel, and baby accessories went next,\r\nthen the women\'s magazines when they lost their advertising. In a few\r\nyears, the condition hit the schools; one by one they closed their\r\ndoors.\r\n\r\nIt was a creeping paralysis. The toy makers and sellers collapsed. The\r\nclothing industry couldn\'t survive longer. The shoe-makers were hardest\r\nhit. Food consumption dropped. All over the country, farmers went\r\nbroke....\r\n\r\nBy comparison, the Great Depression seemed like a boom.\r\n\r\nBy 1965 the end was in sight. Society disintegrated. 

The cities were\r\ndeserted; they burned for years. From a mechanical-agricultural\r\ncivilization, the world returned to the stone age in one decade.\r\n\r\nPeople went in packs for protection. There were two kinds of them:\r\npacks of men hunting for food and packs of women hunting for men.\r\n\r\nSoon, as the women grow too old for child-bearing, the race of Man will\r\nbe doomed.\r\n\r\nI did it. I am guilty. 

Lindsay helped, but I am the one. But how was I\r\nto know that society--that human life itself--was founded on a basic\r\ndeception?\r\n\r\nI wonder what is keeping Lindsay. He should be back by now.\r\n\r\n    _Editor\'s note: This manuscript was found in a cellar of a house in\r\n    a Midwestern city; it is presented here partly for its historical\r\n    interest, but chiefly for your amusement._\r\n\r\n    _Mr. Wilma Masters (the former Andrew Jones) was found in the same\r\n    cellar.

copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe man who discovered that the world was flat, after all, was an\r\nAustralian hermit named Herbert Fitzgrone. He was a thoughtful man with\r\na glass eye and a metal plate in his head, both obtained during the\r\nBoer War. In the bush shanty where he had lived for forty years, he\r\nstudied the riddle of the universe.\r\n\r\nOne day, shortly after he had turned sixty, he made his astonishing\r\ndiscovery. He went to Sydney, and found his way to the office of the\r\neditor of the _Sydney Sun_. He opened the door and went in. "The world,\r\nsir," he said simply, "is flat."\r\n\r\nThose historic words were the first inkling of the scientific storm\r\nthat was to burst without warning on a complacently globular world.\r\nUnfortunately, the editor was not there to hear them. It was 11:00\r\nA.M., Pacific time, and the Sydney pubs were open. Herbert Fitzgrone, a\r\npatient man to whom years were as seconds, sat down in the empty office\r\nto wait.\r\n\r\nWhen the editor showed up at 4:35 P.M., he seemed a trifle confused.\r\nHe hung his hat on Fitzgrone\'s head, and sat down in the waste paper\r\nbasket. The man of science then stood erect and said it again. "The\r\nworld, sir, is flat."\r\n\r\n"That so?" 

said the editor. "You know, I always had a secret hunch it\r\nwas." He was an amiable man, with four children and a glass fountain\r\npen that flashed a light in the top when he used it. At that moment he\r\nwasn\'t quite sure whether Herbert Fitzgrone was alone or at the head of\r\na delegation.\r\n\r\n"I expected you to scoff," Herbert Fitzgrone said, a shade of\r\ndisappointment in his tone. "After all, when Columbus and Magellan said\r\nthe world was round, everybody scoffed. I came here prepared to be\r\nscoffed at."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like to scoff at anybody," the editor said. "I once scoffed at\r\na man in a pub, and he hit me in the eye."\r\n\r\n"Well, if you won\'t," the scientist said, vexed, "you won\'t. Anyhow,\r\nI want to show you my proof that the earth as a globe is a monstrous\r\nimpossibility. Look here." 

He spread out some sheets of paper on the\r\neditor\'s desk.\r\n\r\n"My," said the editor. "Impressive, all right. What is it?"\r\n\r\n"Trigonometry. Do you understand it?"\r\n\r\n"No, but I\'m very fond of it. All those big numbers and everything.\r\nVery impressive."\r\n\r\n"Well, my calculations prove that the earth couldn\'t be a globe,\r\nbecause two lines of latitude can\'t possibly be at the same level. Do\r\nyou realize what that means?"\r\n\r\n"My God," said the editor in awe.\r\n\r\n"Exactly! Suppose you had two ships in Sydney Harbor, one seven miles\r\nnorth of the other. According to the globular theory, the northern ship\r\nwould also be four miles higher!"\r\n\r\nThe editor lurched in his swivel chair. 

"Stop the presses!" he yelled\r\ninto the phone, as he had seen editors do in American films. "And get\r\nme the Hatson Line quickly!"\r\n\r\nHe waited for his connection. Then he said, "This is the editor of the\r\n_Sun_. Listen and listen carefully. 

Hold all sailings until further\r\nnotice! I\'ve just learned that the earth is flat! _Flat_, do you\r\nunderstand? God help the ships at sea!"\r\n\r\nHe hung up, wan and shaken. Then he rushed for the door to get the\r\nstory on the presses. 

He was already through the door when he made the\r\nodd discovery that it wasn\'t the door. It was the window, it was open,\r\nand his office was on the ninth floor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNothing more was heard of Herbert Fitzgrone after this tragedy.\r\nPresumably frightened that he might be held responsible for the\r\neditor\'s death, the scientist disappeared. Fortunately for posterity,\r\nhowever, he neglected to pick up the calculations he had spread out on\r\nthe editor\'s desk.\r\n\r\nThey were discovered by a vice-president of the Hatson Line, who came\r\nto the editor\'s office for further enlightenment. This gentleman made\r\na prolonged study of the papers--he was quick on the trig and a fast\r\nman with a digit. He came to the terrifying conclusion that Christopher\r\nColumbus had made a terrible mistake.\r\n\r\nHe immediately cabled the New York office, forwarding all figures\r\ndown to the last spherical triangle. The head of the New York office,\r\na patriotic man, promptly dispatched the whole thing to the State\r\nDepartment in Washington, marked "Top Secret." Five minutes later Drew\r\nPearson predicted darkly that the whole world would shortly find itself\r\nflat on its back.\r\n\r\nThe nation\'s top scientists were summoned to a secret and speedy\r\nconclave at the White House. The President put it squarely up to the\r\nscientists--was the world round, or wasn\'t it? And if it wasn\'t, what\r\neffect would a flat world have on the nation\'s defenses? Was this a\r\nboost for communism or democracy?\r\n\r\n"Speak up, boys," he said. "I haven\'t got all day."\r\n\r\n"Ridiculous, Mr. 

President," one scientist sneered. "If the world is\r\nflat, how do you explain that when you approach a mountain or ship at\r\nsea, you see first the summit or funnels?"\r\n\r\n"What you see depends upon the weather," a young scientist insisted.\r\n"If there are low clouds, you don\'t see the top first. Then again,\r\nwhat you see first often depends on what you _want_ to see first! 

It\'s\r\nconditioning. Have you ever made a conscious effort to see the bottoms\r\nfirst?"\r\n\r\nA little scientist with a high neck and a squint jumped up. "When a\r\npartial eclipse of the moon takes place, the shadow of the earth on\r\nthe moon is a circle. Only a ball-shaped object can throw a circular\r\nshadow, gentlemen!"\r\n\r\n"Poppycock!" scoffed a scientist next to him. "So can a flat disk.\r\nFurthermore, who is an authority here on what happens on the moon?\r\nMoon-gazing is guesswork, gentlemen--sheer guesswork!"\r\n\r\nA worried little bald man pleaded, "Why can\'t we reconcile these\r\nhostile theories of apple-shape and saucer-shape into a compromise\r\nconcept which will satisfy everybody?"\r\n\r\n"Exactly!" a ribald voice shouted. "Apple-saucer!"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Einstein?" said the President hopefully.\r\n\r\nThe great man rose wistfully. "I am sorry, Mr. President," he said\r\nmeekly. 

"But it is all over my head."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Flash," said Walter Winchell on Sunday night. "Attention, Mr. and Mrs.\r\nAmerica and all the ships at sea. I, Walter Winchell, want to tell you,\r\nwhoever you are, that I, Walter Winchell, am the first as usual to\r\nbreak the most sensational scoop of the century! I, Walter Winchell,\r\nnow tell you, whoever you are, that the world is no longer round, but\r\nflat. Flat, ladies and gentlemen ... F-L-A-T. 

Geography marches on! And\r\nthe very first baby to be born into this new flat world...."\r\n\r\nHearst papers promptly informed their readers that: REDS SABOTAGE\r\nGLOBE! The _New York Times_, with eminent fairness, editorialized:\r\n"It would seem that there is a great deal of justification for the\r\nnew theory that the world is flat, while on the other hand, it seems\r\nequally dubious that there is sufficient evidence for discarding the\r\nglobular theory which has had, we cannot afford to overlook, the\r\ndistinguished test of time."\r\n\r\nReaders of the _Daily Worker_ turned for the facts, as usual, to the\r\n_Herald Tribune_. The Communist Party suffered its usual crisis. One\r\ngroup contended that accepting the new theory would split the unity\r\nof the working class, diverting attention from the class struggle.\r\nThe other group bitterly maintained that to adhere to the discredited\r\nglobular theory would be a betrayal of Marx.\r\n\r\nThe latter lost. The result was a new splinter party called the True\r\nMarxists, which called a world rally to form the new popular front,\r\nthe Flat World Workers Party. On the other side of the barricades, the\r\nN.A.M. and American Legion denounced flat-worldism as an attack on the\r\nvery principles on which our great nation of free enterprise is founded.\r\n\r\nGabriel Heatter cried, "Ah, my friends, let\'s not be deceived! Let\'s\r\nnot be duped by this subtle attack on all that we hold dear, all that\r\nwe have learned in the little red schoolhouse, in cherished days gone\r\nby!"\r\n\r\n"This," Henry J. Taylor declared scathingly, "is the sort of thing we\r\nmight have expected in the worst days of the New Deal. What actually\r\nlies behind this subversive campaign to convince Americans that the\r\nworld is actually flat? Just this. Certain interests want you to\r\nbelieve that Columbus was wrong, that he made a mistake, when he\r\nsaid the world was round. If you swallow this, then you must believe\r\nhis discovery of America was also a fantastic mistake. Is any decent\r\nAmerican willing to concede that the founding of our great nation was\r\nnothing but a blunder?"\r\n\r\nThe Un-American Activities Committee immediately held hearings in\r\nWashington. Witnesses on all sides of the question were summoned.\r\nAmong those who testified were Herbert Hoover, Gabriel Heatter, Henry\r\nJ. Taylor, Thomas Dewey, Robert Taft, John Foster Dulles, Henry Luce,\r\nGerald K. Smith, Representative Rankin, Louis Budenz, Whittaker\r\nChambers, Elizabeth Dilling and Westbrook Pegler, who revealed that\r\nthe whole thing was a plot by Mrs. Roosevelt. Henry Wallace was also\r\ncalled, cited for contempt in the first five minutes, and thereafter\r\nthe proceedings went smoothly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe C.I.O. and the A.F. 

of L. held special conventions to consider\r\nwhat stand labor should take on the issue. Since they felt it had\r\nlittle bearing on wages, hours or the Taft-Hartley Act, they passed a\r\nresolution to remain neutral. Or, as one delegate put it, to live in a\r\nworld without shape.\r\n\r\nA wave of unrest swept over the country. Teachers went on record in\r\nfavor of a flat world, out of sheer boredom with trying to cram the\r\nopposite concept into the thick skulls of small fry. Shipping companies\r\nand airlines spent millions in paid advertising to fight the flat world\r\nidea. They feared that business would fall off if people got scared\r\nabout doing the same.\r\n\r\nThose who accepted the theory were stigmatized as "flatheads," and were\r\nexhorted in black ad headlines: "DON\'T BE A FLATHEAD!" This led to the\r\ncoining of the counter-epithet, "globephobe."\r\n\r\nM.G.M. announced it would produce "The Flat Earth," made by the same\r\nhands who turned out "The Good Earth." Warner Brothers promptly\r\npurchased a vehicle called "One Globe" to star Humphrey Bogart as\r\nColumbus, Lauren Bacall as Queen Isabella, and Paul Muni as the _Santa\r\nMaria_.\r\n\r\nThe controversy spilled over into the United Nations. Russia, which\r\ndiscovered that it looked more imposing on flat maps, demanded that\r\nall globe maps be destroyed under a death penalty for non-compliance.\r\nThe United States, out of habit, opposed this idea. Despite\r\n$3,567,219,483,128.50 rushed as a loan to Albania, Iceland and 72\r\nother nations, the U.N. vote went with the Soviet. As one Albanian\r\ngrumbled, "They didn\'t send Chesterfields--just Wings."\r\n\r\nRussia\'s victory had reverberations heard around the world ... or\r\nrather, along the sides of the world. Old geographies were burned.\r\nGlobe maps were broken in half and used for ashtrays. The flat map won\r\nthe international distinction of being referred to as the Moscow map.\r\nGlobetrotters were laid off by the lecture bureaus in droves. Universal\r\nPictures had the plane in its trademark sky-write the company\'s name\r\naround a terrestrial saucer.\r\n\r\nThe world could not exist half round, half flat, the President of the\r\nUnited States told Congress sadly. And since the rest of the world was\r\nflat, there was no help for it--America would have to flatten out, too.\r\nDespite globephobe cries of "Shame!" the famous 22nd Amendment was\r\nadded to the Constitution:--\r\n\r\n"The world shall, for all purposes of this Republic, be considered\r\nas flat. The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by\r\nappropriate legislation. Any article or any amendment which may contain\r\nany implication that the world is round is hereby nullified and\r\nrepealed."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow that the world is once more flat, unified and serene, I do not\r\nthink that there can be any serious consequences if I reveal the\r\nsequel to this historic development. It came about when the editor\r\nof a national magazine, at his wit\'s end for a strong piece to follow\r\nhis usual lead article of "Is Sex Here To Stay" or "How Sexy Are You\r\nSexually?", hit upon the notion of sending me to Australia to find the\r\nman who had discovered the earth was flat.\r\n\r\nIt took me months of searching through the outback to locate Herbert\r\nFitzgrone. He was still living in his bush shanty, and had just turned\r\neighty when I found him. I had great difficulty in persuading him to\r\ntell me the whole story, as he was totally absorbed in a new scientific\r\nstudy. He was on the verge, he told me jubilantly, of proving that\r\nthere is no such thing as gravity, and that Newton was an ass.\r\n\r\nWhen I persisted in knowing more about his original research that had\r\nexploded the globular theory, he smiled dryly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, _that_! Well, you probably know that I left all my calculations\r\nbehind in that editor\'s office. When I came back here, I decided to\r\nwork out a duplicate set. Well, sir, do you know what I discovered?\r\nThat old Columbus had been right all along! I\'d put the decimal point\r\nfor the algebraic equation of one plane triangle in the wrong place."\r\n\r\n"But that\'s impossible!" I burst out in horror. "Why, the whole world\r\nis flat now as a result of your calculations!"\r\n\r\n"You don\'t say," Herbert Fitzgrone chuckled. 

"Well, now!"\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


"\r\n\r\nFord, the physicist, glanced at General LeRoy. The general had that\r\nquizzical expression on his face, the look that meant he was about to do\r\nsomething decisive.\r\n\r\n"Would you like to see the problem first-hand?" the general asked,\r\ninnocently.\r\n\r\nThe CIA man took a quick look at his wristwatch. "O.K., if it doesn\'t\r\ntake too long. 

It\'s late enough already."\r\n\r\n"It won\'t take very long, will it, Ford?" the general said, getting out\r\nof his chair.\r\n\r\n"Not very long," Ford agreed. "Only a lifetime."\r\n\r\nThe CIA man grunted as they went to the doorway and left the general\'s\r\noffice. Going down the dark, deserted hallway, their footsteps echoed\r\nhollowly.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t overemphasize the seriousness of the problem," General LeRoy\r\nsaid to the CIA man. "Eight ranking members of the General Staff have\r\neither resigned their commissions or gone straight to the violent ward\r\nafter just one session with the computer."\r\n\r\nThe CIA man scowled. "Is this area Secure?"\r\n\r\nGeneral LeRoy\'s face turned red. "This entire building is as Secure as\r\nany edifice in the Free World, mister. And it\'s empty. We\'re the only\r\nliving people inside here at this hour. I\'m not taking any chances.

"\r\n\r\n"Just want to be sure."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps if I explain the computer a little more," Ford said, changing\r\nthe subject, "you\'ll know what to expect."\r\n\r\n"Good idea," said the man from CIA.\r\n\r\n"We told you that this is the most modern, most complex and delicate\r\ncomputer in the world ... nothing like it has ever been attempted\r\nbefore--anywhere."\r\n\r\n"I know that They don\'t have anything like it," the CIA man agreed.\r\n\r\n"And you also know, I suppose, that it was built to simulate actual war\r\nsituations. We fight wars in this computer ... wars with missiles and\r\nbombs and gas. Real wars, complete down to the tiniest detail. The\r\ncomputer tells us what will actually happen to every missile, every city,\r\nevery man ... who dies, how many planes are lost, how many trucks will\r\nfail to start on a cold morning, whether a battle is won or lost ..."\r\n\r\nGeneral LeRoy interrupted. "The computer runs these analyses for both\r\nsides, so we can see what\'s happening to Them, too."\r\n\r\nThe CIA man gestured impatiently. "War games simulations aren\'t new.\r\nYou\'ve been doing them for years."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but this machine is different," Ford pointed out. "It not only\r\ngives a much more detailed war game. It\'s the next logical step in the\r\ndevelopment of machine-simulated war games." 

He hesitated dramatically.\r\n\r\n"Well, what is it?"\r\n\r\n"We\'ve added a variation of the electro-encephalograph ..."\r\n\r\nThe CIA man stopped walking. "The electro-what?"\r\n\r\n"Electro-encephalograph. You know, a recording device that reads the\r\nelectrical patterns of your brain. Like the electro-cardiograph."\r\n\r\n"Oh."\r\n\r\n"But you see, we\'ve given the EEG a reverse twist. Instead of using a\r\nmachine that makes a recording of the brain\'s electrical wave output,\r\nwe\'ve developed a device that will take the computer\'s readout tapes,\r\nand turn them into electrical patterns that are put _into_ your brain!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t get it.

"\r\n\r\nGeneral LeRoy took over. "You sit at the machine\'s control console. A\r\nhelmet is placed over your head. You set the machine in operation. You\r\n_see_ the results."\r\n\r\n"Yes," Ford went on. "Instead of reading rows of figures from the\r\ncomputer\'s printer ... you actually see the war being fought. Complete\r\nvisual and auditory hallucinations. You can watch the progress of the\r\nbattles, and as you change strategy and tactics you can see the results\r\nbefore your eyes."\r\n\r\n"The idea, originally, was to make it easier for the General Staff to\r\nvisualize strategic situations," General LeRoy said.\r\n\r\n"But every one who\'s used the machine has either resigned his commission\r\nor gone insane," Ford added.\r\n\r\nThe CIA man cocked an eye at LeRoy. "You\'ve used the computer."\r\n\r\n"Correct."\r\n\r\n"And you have neither resigned nor cracked up."\r\n\r\nGeneral LeRoy nodded. 

"I called you in."\r\n\r\nBefore the CIA man could comment, Ford said, "The computer\'s right\r\ninside this doorway. Let\'s get this over with while the building is\r\nstill empty."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey stepped in. The physicist and the general showed the CIA man\r\nthrough the room-filling rows of massive consoles.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all transistorized and subminiaturized, of course," Ford\r\nexplained. "That\'s the only way we could build so much detail into the\r\nmachine and still have it small enough to fit inside a single building."\r\n\r\n"A single building?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes; this is only the control section. Most of this building is\r\ntaken up by the circuits, the memory banks, and the rest of it."\r\n\r\n"Hm-m-m."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ILLUSTRATED BY SCHELLING]\r\n\r\nThey showed him finally to a small desk, studded with control buttons\r\nand dials. The single spotlight above the desk lit it brilliantly, in\r\nharsh contrast to the semidarkness of the rest of the room.\r\n\r\n"Since you\'ve never run the computer before," Ford said, "General LeRoy\r\nwill do the controlling. You just sit and watch what happens."\r\n\r\nThe general sat in one of the well-padded chairs and donned a grotesque\r\nheadgear that was connected to the desk by a half-dozen wires. The CIA\r\nman took his chair slowly.\r\n\r\nWhen they put one of the bulky helmets on him, he looked up at them,\r\nsquinting a little in the bright light. "This ... this isn\'t going\r\nto ... well, do me any damage, is it?

"\r\n\r\n"My goodness, no," Ford said. "You mean mentally? No, of course not.\r\nYou\'re not on the General Staff, so it shouldn\'t ... it won\'t ... affect\r\nyou the way it did the others. Their reaction had nothing to do with the\r\ncomputer _per se_ ..."\r\n\r\n"Several civilians have used the computer with no ill effects," General\r\nLeRoy said. "Ford has used it many times."\r\n\r\nThe CIA man nodded, and they closed the transparent visor over his face.\r\nHe sat there and watched General LeRoy press a series of buttons, then\r\nturn a dial.\r\n\r\n"Can you hear me?" The general\'s voice came muffled through the helmet.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said.\r\n\r\n"All right. Here we go. 

You\'re familiar with Situation One-Two-One?\r\nThat\'s what we\'re going to be seeing."\r\n\r\nSituation One-Two-One was a standard war game. The CIA man was well\r\nacquainted with it. 

He watched the general flip a switch, then sit back\r\nand fold his arms over his chest. A row of lights on the desk console\r\nbegan blinking on and off, one, two, three ... down to the end of the\r\nrow, then back to the beginning again, on and off, on and off ...\r\n\r\nAnd then, somehow, he could see it!\r\n\r\nHe was poised incredibly somewhere in space, and he could see it all in\r\na funny, blurry-double-sighted, dream-like way. He seemed to be seeing\r\nseveral pictures and hearing many voices, all at once. It was all mixed\r\nup, and yet it made a weird kind of sense.\r\n\r\nFor a panicked instant he wanted to rip the helmet off his head. _It\'s\r\nonly an illusion_, he told himself, forcing calm on his unwilling\r\nnerves. _Only an illusion._\r\n\r\nBut it seemed strangely real.\r\n\r\nHe was watching the Gulf of Mexico. He could see Florida off to his\r\nright, and the arching coast of the southeastern United States. He could\r\neven make out the Rio Grande River.\r\n\r\nSituation One-Two-One started, he remembered, with the discovery of\r\nmissile-bearing Enemy submarines in the Gulf. Even as he watched the\r\nwhole area--as though perched on a satellite--he could see, underwater\r\nand close-up, the menacing shadowy figure of a submarine gliding through\r\nthe crystal blue sea.\r\n\r\nHe saw, too, a patrol plane as it spotted the submarine and sent an\r\nurgent radio warning.\r\n\r\nThe underwater picture dissolved in a bewildering burst of bubbles. A\r\nmissile had been launched. Within seconds, another burst--this time a\r\nnuclear depth charge--utterly destroyed the submarine.\r\n\r\nIt was confusing. He was everyplace at once. The details were\r\noverpowering, but the total picture was agonizingly clear.\r\n\r\nSix submarines fired missiles from the Gulf of Mexico. Four were\r\nimmediately sunk, but too late. New Orleans, St. Louis and three Air\r\nForce bases were obliterated by hydrogen-fusion warheads.\r\n\r\nThe CIA man was familiar with the opening stages of the war. The first\r\nmissile fired at the United States was the signal for whole fleets of\r\nmissiles and bombers to launch themselves at the Enemy. It was confusing\r\nto see the world at once; at times he could not tell if the fireball and\r\nmushroom cloud was over Chicago or Shanghai, New York or Novosibirsk,\r\nBaltimore or Budapest.\r\n\r\nIt did not make much difference, really. They all got it in the first\r\nfew hours of the war; as did London and Moscow, Washington and Peking,\r\nDetroit and Delhi, and many, many more.\r\n\r\nThe defensive systems on all sides seemed to operate well, except that\r\nthere were never enough anti-missiles. Defensive systems were expensive\r\ncompared to attack rockets. It was cheaper to build a deterrent than to\r\ndefend against it.\r\n\r\nThe missiles flashed up from submarines and railway cars, from\r\nunderground silos and stratospheric jets; secret ones fired off\r\nautomatically when a certain airbase command post ceased beaming out a\r\nrestraining radio signal. The defensive systems were simply overloaded.\r\nAnd when the bombs ran out, the missiles carried dust and germs and gas.\r\nOn and on. For six days and six firelit nights. Launch, boost, coast,\r\nre-enter, death.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd now it was over, the CIA man thought. The missiles were all gone.\r\nThe airplanes were exhausted. The nations that had built the weapons no\r\nlonger existed. By all the rules he knew of, the war should have been\r\nended.\r\n\r\nYet the fighting did not end. The machine knew better. There were still\r\nmany ways to kill an enemy. Time-tested ways. There were armies fighting\r\nin four continents, armies that had marched overland, or splashed ashore\r\nfrom the sea, or dropped out of the skies.\r\n\r\nIncredibly, the war went on. When the tanks ran out of gas, and the\r\nflame throwers became useless, and even the prosaic artillery pieces had\r\nno more rounds to fire, there were still simple guns and even simpler\r\nbayonets and swords.\r\n\r\nThe proud armies, the descendents of the Alexanders and Caesars and\r\nTemujins and Wellingtons and Grants and Rommels, relived their evolution\r\nin reverse.\r\n\r\nThe war went on. Slowly, inevitably, the armies split apart into smaller\r\nand smaller units, until the tortured countryside that so recently had\r\nfelt the impact of nuclear war once again knew the tread of bands of\r\narmed marauders. The tiny savage groups, stranded in alien lands, far\r\nfrom the homes and families that they knew to be destroyed, carried on a\r\nmockery of war, lived off the land, fought their own countrymen if the\r\noccasion suited, and revived the ancient terror of hand-wielded,\r\npersonal, one-head-at-a-time killing.\r\n\r\nThe CIA man watched the world disintegrate. Death was an individual\r\nbusiness now, and none the better for no longer being mass-produced. In\r\nagonized fascination he saw the myriad ways in which a man might die.\r\nMurder was only one of them. Radiation, disease, toxic gases that\r\nlingered and drifted on the once-innocent winds, and--finally--the most\r\nefficient destroyer of them all: starvation.\r\n\r\nThree billion people (give or take a meaningless hundred million) lived\r\non the planet Earth when the war began. Now, with the tenuous thread of\r\ncivilization burned away, most of those who were not killed by the\r\nfighting itself succumbed inexorably to starvation.\r\n\r\nNot everyone died, of course. Life went on. Some were lucky.\r\n\r\nA long darkness settled on the world. Life went on for a few, a pitiful\r\nfew, a bitter, hateful, suspicious, savage few. Cities became pestholes.\r\nBooks became fuel. Knowledge died. Civilization was completely gone from\r\nthe planet Earth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe helmet was lifted slowly off his head. The CIA man found that he was\r\ntoo weak to raise his arms and help. He was shivering and damp with\r\nperspiration.\r\n\r\n"Now you see," Ford said quietly, "why the military men cracked up when\r\nthey used the computer."\r\n\r\nGeneral LeRoy, even, was pale. "How can a man with any conscience at all\r\ndirect a military operation when he knows that _that_ will be the\r\nconsequence?"\r\n\r\nThe CIA man struck up a cigarette and pulled hard on it. He exhaled\r\nsharply. "Are all the war games ... like that? Every plan?"\r\n\r\n"Some are worse," Ford said. "We picked an average one for you. Even\r\nsome of the \'brushfire\' games get out of hand and end up like that."\r\n\r\n"So ... what do you intend to do? Why did you call me in? 

What can _I_\r\ndo?"\r\n\r\n"You\'re with CIA," the general said. "Don\'t you handle espionage?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but what\'s that got to do with it?

"\r\n\r\nThe general looked at him. "It seems to me that the next logical step is\r\nto make damned certain that _They_ get the plans to this computer ...\r\nand fast!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Analog Science Fact & Fiction_ May\r\n    1962.

The quiet. 

And the solitude. But there was\r\nalways Suzy, linking him to the earth so many miles away.\r\n\r\n"One hundred and forty-three days out, four hundred and seven to go."\r\nThe ritual of the report, designed to keep him thinking, day after day.\r\n\r\n"Nothing to report, sir, all equipment functioning. All graphs tracking.\r\nNo abnormality of any kind. My health is good...."\r\n\r\nIn four hundred and seven days they would bring him down, nearly mad,\r\nnearly dead, but his records well made on earth, and the record was what\r\ncounted.\r\n\r\nFive hundred and fifty days in an observation capsule, the economical\r\nhuman machine that did the work of fifty tons of unprojectable\r\nelectronic equipment. Five hundred and fifty days of cold and quiet and\r\nsolitude. The first eight men had died in the cold and loneliness of\r\nspace, until they thought of Suzy, there in the WAC manned offices at\r\nPoint Magu.\r\n\r\n"Suzy! My God, Suzy, where are you?" Whit could stand the waiting until\r\nthe time came close, then his mind would give away until her voice,\r\nbridging the space void came to him and brought him peace.\r\n\r\n"Whit? Whit, wake up, in case you\'re asleep. It\'s me, it\'s Suzy."\r\n\r\n"Asleep! You know I\'m not asleep! You know I stay awake for you! I\'ll\r\nalways be awake, Suzy. I wouldn\'t miss a minute with you, not a second."\r\n\r\n"Gee, Whit, you\'re nice. You\'re awful nice."\r\n\r\n"Suzy, for the hundredth time, will you marry me?"\r\n\r\n"Aw, Whit, you know I can\'t. You know they made me promise that before I\r\ntook the job."\r\n\r\n"Promise to be a talking floozy to fifty men in space, to hold \'em all\r\nat arm\'s length, let \'em love you, then leave \'em in the cold when they\r\ncame back down to earth. They made you promise to keep us stringing\r\nalong, until we got back home safe and sound, then turn us loose with\r\nour love for you burning a hole in our hearts! They made you promise a\r\nthing like that, Suzy?\r\n\r\n"You can\'t handle the merchandise, Whit. When you come down, then we\'ll\r\ntalk over things together."\r\n\r\n"Suzy, I love you, I love you!"\r\n\r\n"I mustn\'t say that I love you too, Whit. They made me promise that I\r\nwouldn\'t say that. But Whit, you\'re awful nice."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhit sat silent, and Suzy kept on talking. She could always talk. No\r\nmatter what you said to her, no matter how you felt, no matter where you\r\nwere, Suzy could always talk to you and make your life seem brighter,\r\nand the trip back home again worth fighting to make. You fell in love\r\nwith Suzy, they all did, but as she always said, they made her promise\r\nnot to say she loved you back. Not until you got back home, safe and\r\nsound and sane.\r\n\r\nThat was Suzy\'s job on earth, in a drab little office with an engineer\r\nwho controlled her channels, and sometimes blushed at what he heard go\r\nout over them. She spoke, sometimes gaily, sometimes gently, sometimes\r\nwith all the frail strength of her body, into a microphone beamed to\r\neach capsule in turn, and in those capsules were men, who, but for her,\r\nwould go mad before their time was up.\r\n\r\nAnd Suzy never cheated, and she never lied, and she never changed. She\r\nwas the love light of outer space, she and a dozen others at Point Magu.\r\nShe kept men sane, and she brought them home, and she kept her promise\r\nnever to love and never to marry until they came back again.\r\n\r\n"Whit? What we were talking about yesterday. 

Did you think about that?"\r\n\r\n"You mean about the gardenias?"\r\n\r\n"Umhummm. My gardenias, to pin on my blouse."\r\n\r\n"Suzy, I\'ll bring you a thousand, one each day, until you say you love\r\nme. I\'m drawing them now, on paper, one every day, for you."\r\n\r\n"Aw, Whit, you\'re awful nice."\r\n\r\nThen, after frantic good-byes, shouting, screaming, pounding on the\r\nmicrophone, hoping that the dead metal would somehow speak once more,\r\nWhit would settle back for another day\'s dreaming of Suzy, while he kept\r\nhis tiny house-in-space, read his little gauges, and kept his dreams\r\nalive. It was only in the afternoon that madness came too close, and in\r\nthe power-saving darkness he raged and cursed and pled and begged, until\r\nSuzy\'s voice came winging out of space to comfort him for another day,\r\nwhen they talked of all the beautiful things that people talk about when\r\nthere is love between them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor Suzy loved her men, all seven of them. To know them well, to listen\r\ntime and again to their recorded conversations, to pick out points that\r\nwere worth repeating, to avoid the subjects that depressed them, to say\r\nwhat would bring them home in love with her was a pleasure to her, and\r\nshe worked hard at the job. All alone, late into the night, Suzy would\r\nsit in her little office, listening to her records, and planning the\r\nnext day\'s battle for the sanity of her men.\r\n\r\n"Now Al," she\'d muse, "he\'ll want to know how that recipe came out, the\r\none with the mushrooms. Poor guy, he does like to eat. I\'ll tell him\r\nabout the party I went to with Sheila, and how she ate up all the rum\r\ncakes and could hardly find her way home again. He\'ll like that.

"\r\n\r\n"And Jim. He\'d like to have another problem, like the twelve coin one. I\r\nwish I had a mind like his. Maybe Miss Graham can find me a book on math\r\nproblems that a man can do in his head. And I\'ll tell him how nice it\r\nwould be to be a professor\'s wife, and a little college in the north.\r\nHe doesn\'t want _me_ yet, but he wants somebody...."\r\n\r\n"I guess I\'ll have to talk sex to Crazy Cat, too. It\'s about the only\r\nthing he likes to think about, and that\'s my job. I hope he doesn\'t\r\nrealize I\'m not the hellcat he seems to think I am. Maybe some of the\r\ngirls could give me some ideas he\'d like to think about; my dates are\r\npretty dull. They really should have given Crazy Cat to somebody else.\r\nSome psychiatrist slipped up there, I guess. But I\'ll bring him down!\r\nI\'ll bring him down sane if I have to wade in filth up to my eyeballs!\r\nThat\'s a joke."\r\n\r\n"Whit\'s hopeless, he loves me so. I hope he doesn\'t go off the deep end,\r\nand end up whacky. Maybe we\'ll have to relay him some instrument checks,\r\nto keep him busy. Or maybe, if I told him I\'d marry him it would keep\r\nhim leveled for a while. Can\'t say that too soon, though, or he\'d go\r\nnuts from jealousy. 

I guess I\'ll just have to keep on letting him love\r\nme, just being me, just showing him I care about him as much as I can.\r\nHe\'s a dear, really."\r\n\r\nThat was the way Suzy mused, in her drab little office, after hours,\r\ndoing her job for her men, her hopes up in the sky where only her voice\r\nand her love could reach them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMiss Graham was stiff, and stood tall in her prim tailored suit. Her\r\ndark man\'s necktie clashed with her hair and her complexion, but her\r\nface was kind and her voice, although firm, was soft and understanding.\r\n\r\n"Suzy, I want to talk to you. Don\'t get up.

"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Miss Graham?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been listening to some of your records. Some of this stuff you\'ve\r\nbeen putting out is going to make us trouble, you know."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry, Miss Graham. 

I try to do what I think is best, and you know\r\nI spend a lot of time planning. It\'s too late to shift poor Crazy Cat to\r\nanybody else, and it\'s the only thing that seems...."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not talking about Crazy Cat Tompkins, Suzy," interrupted Miss\r\nGraham. "I\'m talking about Whit Clayborne.

"\r\n\r\n"I see. I know I shouldn\'t have said that I\'d marry him, but gosh, he\r\nwas just about to go to pieces, right while I was talking to him. I\r\ncould hear him grit his teeth, and I could hear the mike squeak with the\r\ngrip he had on it. It was awful, Miss Graham."\r\n\r\n"Couldn\'t you have waited? You could have asked me what to do, you\r\nknow. Men ask our girls to marry them every day; it isn\'t as if it was a\r\nnew problem that we hadn\'t handled before."\r\n\r\n"But he needed me, right then. I didn\'t think he could wait. I _had_ to\r\nsay I\'d marry him, or he\'d have been biting pieces out of his mattress."\r\n\r\n"I know you did your best, Suzy. Those rules, well, they\'re not only for\r\nhis protection, you know. What are you going to do when Whit Clayborne\r\nlands, and comes in here to claim his bride? Had you thought of that?"\r\n\r\n"Honestly, Miss Graham, I didn\'t think of anything, except that he\r\nneeded me at the time. But of course I\'ll let him go. I\'d let him go\r\neven if the rules didn\'t say I had to."\r\n\r\nMiss Graham\'s voice was unexpectedly gentle. "You want to get married,\r\ndon\'t you? We _could_ break a rule, just this once."\r\n\r\n"Not like that, Miss Graham. Not like that. It wouldn\'t be fair to hold\r\nhim to a promise that he made in space. Even if you\'d let me do it, I\r\nwouldn\'t marry him. I couldn\'t live with myself. He doesn\'t know, well,\r\nabout me. He wouldn\'t have loved me if I\'d told him. He\'s never seen me;\r\nall he\'s in love with is a voice that understands how to keep him sane.\r\nI wouldn\'t hold him to that promise, Miss Graham, if he was the last\r\nchance to marry that I\'d ever have."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMiss Graham was silent for a few moments, then turned to the door.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve figured out how to let him know that you won\'t marry him?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell him when he comes down."\r\n\r\n"And you think that just telling him will do the trick, Suzy?"\r\n\r\n"The way I\'ll tell him, it\'ll stick, oh it\'ll stick all right." Suzy\r\nchoked off the last words, and blinked back the tears that seemed to\r\ncome into her eyes.\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad you\'ve got it figured out, dear." Miss Graham said\r\napprovingly. "His orbit got knocked loose somehow, and he\'ll be in this\r\nevening, to talk things over."\r\n\r\nSuzy gasped. "So soon? I mean, well, I\'ve got it sort of figured, but,\r\nwell," she paused, collecting her thoughts. "As well now as ever, I\r\nguess. 

I\'ll wait for him."\r\n\r\n"Do you think he\'d get violent? I could leave a couple of engineers in\r\nthe closet, or maybe you\'d like to have Sheila...."\r\n\r\n"No, I can handle him, and I\'d rather not have Sheila here when he comes\r\nin. I\'ll handle him. 

And thank you, Miss Graham."\r\n\r\nThe door closed on Miss Graham\'s back, and Suzy began to think of Whit\r\nClayborne.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe door opened slowly, and the pale young airman came into the office\r\non unsteady feet, his hat in his left hand, and a small package tucked\r\nunder his arm.\r\n\r\n"Is this Suzy\'s office? I mean, will she be in soon? 

Where can I find\r\nher?" The questions came eagerly.\r\n\r\n"I\'m Suzy."\r\n\r\nFor a minute the words meant nothing to him. He looked, blankly, round\r\nthe office, then back to the seated figure.\r\n\r\n"You recognize the voice, don\'t you, Whit?"\r\n\r\nHe gulped, and the expression drained from his face, leaving it blank,\r\nand helpless. Suzy\'s heart went out to him, as her voice had gone to him\r\nthrough space.\r\n\r\n"I know, the wheel chair, the rug to cover my knees, the brace on my\r\narm. There wasn\'t any other way, Whit. 

I couldn\'t tell you. My voice,\r\nWhit, was all that counted, up there. Down on earth, other things count,\r\ntoo. Forgive me, Whit."\r\n\r\nHis head seemed to swim, and his unsteady feet fumbled with the floor as\r\nhe came to her.\r\n\r\n"You could have told me. I\'d have loved you, I\'d have loved you anyway."\r\n\r\n"Would you?" Her face turned away from him as he came to her. "Would\r\nyou, Whit? Would you have stayed alive for a broken girl like me? Would\r\nyou have waited out your trip for the sake of a cripple in a wheel\r\nchair? I know you, Whit, I know your heart and your soul, and I know\r\nyou\'d have never loved me if I had told you what I was from the\r\nbeginning."\r\n\r\nWhit didn\'t speak, and Suzy continued.\r\n\r\n"It was a job for me, Whit. I had to bring you down. I lied to you and I\r\ndeceived you, and now you\'re free, and you can go away, to live a better\r\nlife than I can give you."\r\n\r\n"Suzy, you\'re saying that. You\'ve thought it out, and you\'ve written it\r\ndown, and it\'s what you planned to say to me. Is it the truth, Suzy?"\r\n\r\n"Whit, go away. I\'ve said my piece. I\'ve turned you loose. Now go! 

Go\r\naway, and don\'t ever come back to me again."\r\n\r\nWhit\'s body seemed to straighten up, and he put his little green package\r\ndown on the desk in front of her, then moved away.\r\n\r\n"Open it up, Suzy. It\'s a gardenia that I brought you. Sick or well,\r\ncrippled or sound, I\'ll bring you another every day, until you say you\r\nlove me."\r\n\r\nThen he went away.\r\n\r\nSuzy rose slowly, kicking the rug from her knees. She folded the wheel\r\nchair into a compact bundle, and stretching up on her toes, put it back\r\non the highest shelf in the closet. Quietly, she put her hat and coat\r\non, and went out of the office, locking the door behind her. The click\r\nof her high heels echoed bravely in the silence as she felt her way\r\nalong the vacant hallway.\r\n\r\n"Sheila, Sheila, come to me, girl," she called.\r\n\r\nThe big German shepherd shook herself as she rose from her bed beside\r\nthe doorway, and with the practiced skill of years brought the handle of\r\nher harness beneath her mistress\'s groping hand.\r\n\r\nSuzy knelt beside the big dog, and put her arms around her furry neck,\r\nweeping softly into the thick fur.\r\n\r\n"Sheila, Sheila, I think he\'s going to marry me!" she said.\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


For one\r\n             day that brain would crack. When it did, the\r\n              World would dissolve in cataclysmic Chaos.\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n                      Planet Stories Spring 1940.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his little tower, perched at the very peak of the great terraced\r\npile of buildings which was his home and his citadel, Peter Groff sat\r\nbrooding with hatred. The city, its factories, its vast plowed fields,\r\nlay stretched below him. Millions of humans, at play in little games.\r\nHow he hated them! And they hated him--hated and feared him. It made\r\nhim chuckle. For all his life he had worked and schemed and fought to\r\nmake himself a power. The richest, most powerful man in the world--he\r\nhad attained it. They had called him cruel, in his youth, with his\r\nruthless business methods. He had laughed. Then they had no longer\r\ndared call him anything which would anger him. And he had laughed at\r\nthat, while he had bought their governments and their armies with his\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nHe was laughing now as he thought of it. In seventy years he had made\r\nthe name Peter Groff a thing at which to tremble. Over all the earth,\r\nfrom the heads of his groveling puppet governments down to the lowliest\r\nchild driving a plow in the fields, there was no one who did not\r\nsecretly fear Groff, the power of his money, the sound of anger in his\r\nvoice. Here in his citadel his servants trembled--and hated him. It was\r\nfunny, because by their methods they had gotten nothing; and he had\r\ngotten everything.\r\n\r\nAlone in his little tower, he sat and brooded. There was little else\r\nto do now, and he enjoyed it--this contemplation of himself and his\r\nachievements. The mirror beside which he sat reflected his image. He\r\nstared at himself. His trusted companion. His face, thin-lipped, was\r\ngrim with its power. His eyes gleamed with it--eyes at which everyone\r\nshivered with fear. The banked rows of his television tuning knobs were\r\nwithin reach of his hand. And he decided that it would be amusing to\r\nlook and to listen from some of the newscasters\' vantage points at what\r\nwas transpiring down in the city streets. He chose one in the factory\r\ndistrict, over by the river. They were the people who had least.\r\n\r\nThe little cathode mirror presently was glowing with the scene he\r\nhad selected. It was a tube-lit city arcade, far down by the lowest\r\nlevel of the Inter-urban railway. Subterranean shops were along its\r\nsides--places where people with the tiniest fraction of money might\r\nspend it for something which wasn\'t worth having.\r\n\r\nAnd as he stared, from one of the shops a young couple came--a\r\ndark-haired, slender young man and a girl who was pretty, and who was\r\nlaughing. They were poorly dressed. They had nothing. But they were\r\nlaughing; and suddenly they were struggling as the young man fastened\r\nupon the girl\'s dress the bauble he had bought, and then was trying to\r\nkiss her for his payment. The scuffle was over in a moment; and Groff\r\nheard from his microphone the girl\'s gasping, murmured words:\r\n\r\n"Oh, Jac--I\'m so happy--"\r\n\r\nGroff stiffened. His thin, lined face was grim as he reached and cut\r\noff the image and the murmuring voice....\r\n\r\nSomething happened to Peter Groff that summer night. He wasn\'t\r\nconscious of it; he only knew that he was enraged as though an attack\r\nhad been made upon him. 

Atrocious things which menaced him needed\r\ncrushing. He pondered it, grim with his planning....\r\n\r\nNear dawn, some of his servants knew that something had happened. They\r\nheard him, with his wild laughter coming in an eerie muffled blur from\r\nhis little tower. Then young Peller dared go up to see what might be\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\n"Is there anything you need of me, Master?" he asked.\r\n\r\nGroff was staring from his great armchair. "Not now, Peller. But I\'ve\r\njust discovered how to solve the situation very quickly. The Master has\r\njust made up his mind, Peller."\r\n\r\nIt was gratifying to see the terror and confusion on Peller\'s face.\r\nGroff\'s gesture drove the servant away, so that he would go down into\r\nthe corridors of the citadel and whisper with all the other servants as\r\nthey trembled, thinking the Master might be displeased with them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe thing took Groff more than a year. The thousands of men whom he\r\nsent secretly throughout the world did as he commanded, and did not\r\nknow why they were doing it. Poor fools. The great scientist who for so\r\nmany years had been in Groff\'s employ gave him the technical knowledge\r\nhe sought. Fools. 

All fools. They could not guess what he was really\r\nafter. The lies he told them which awakened their cupidity were so easy\r\nfor them to believe. No servant could know what any other servant was\r\ndoing. No one could piece it together. There was only the masterful\r\nGroff in his tower weaving the poisonous threads of his gigantic\r\nenterprise into a pattern which only himself could see.\r\n\r\nThen at last he was ready. He had tracked down the identity of the\r\ndark-haired, slender young worker whom the laughing girl had called\r\nJac. And there came the momentous night when he sent for the young man\r\nand the girl, and white-faced, frightened, they stood before him in his\r\nlittle tower.\r\n\r\nGroff lolled back in his big chair as he quietly regarded them. "Quite\r\nan honor for you, isn\'t it?" 

he said. 

"Seeing me in person."\r\n\r\n"What do you want of us?" the young man murmured.\r\n\r\nIt was pleasing to Groff, to see his terror. "I wanted to thank you,"\r\nGroff said ironically. "It happened that I saw you two, one night about\r\na year ago. You made me realize what I must do. 

So I thought I would\r\ntell you about it."\r\n\r\nThey could only stand wordless, frightened. Groff sucked in his breath\r\nwith anticipatory pleasure. In a moment now they would be more than\r\nfrightened; they would be utterly terrified--and their terror would\r\nspread like a wave around the world.\r\n\r\nGroff was lashing himself into grim anger. "You are going to die," he\r\nsaid. At the girl\'s sudden little whimpering gasp he raised his hand.\r\n"That sort of think won\'t help you any. You and everyone on earth--this\r\nis your last night of health. Tomorrow, at dawn, you will all start\r\nswiftly to sicken. In a week, a month--you will be dead."\r\n\r\nHow well they knew that his threats were never empty. They were huddled\r\ntogether now, with trembling arms around each other as they stared\r\nat him. He lashed himself further into anger as he told them that he\r\nrealized how millions of people were conspiring to the end that Groff\r\nmight suffer misfortune. A menace which he could no longer tolerate....\r\nHow those millions would squirm as they saw death coming upon them! The\r\nsupreme power of Groff at last demonstrated to its ultimate. Queer that\r\nhe had never thought of this logical climax to his great career--not\r\nuntil that little incident a year ago when this young couple had caused\r\nhim to envisage it.\r\n\r\nHe was telling them now what he had done.... The little depots all\r\nover the earth, compressed with caged bacteria. Little time-bombs--all\r\nto explode within thirty minutes of this present instant. The women\r\nand children, the aged, would die first. But the polluted air, the\r\ncontagion spreading everywhere--in a week, a month, the swift and\r\ndeadly bacteria would leave no one alive.\r\n\r\n"You--are going to do this to us?" young Jac murmured at last.\r\n\r\n"Why not? 

It is my destiny." Never had Groff felt so quiet and\r\ncomfortable a thrill as now; and this was only the beginning. "Others\r\nbefore me have tried their little conquests," he said with his grim\r\nsmile. "Men who wanted power, and got it, just in a small way and for\r\na little while. There was one--I recall reading about him--one who was\r\nso foolish to disclose all his plans by writing them in a book, years\r\nbefore he had a chance to accomplish them. I am not like him. 

I tell\r\nyou now, when there is a scant thirty minutes before your inevitable\r\nannihilation begins."\r\n\r\n"You hate your fellow men so much," Jac murmured impulsively, "you\r\nwould kill yourself, just for the pleasure of killing the rest of us?"\r\n\r\nTo die. It sent so strangely a queer little shiver over Groff. He had\r\nalways felt it; but no one could ever know it, save himself. How many\r\ntimes his vaunted reckless bravery had awed his fellow man! He sat very\r\nstraight now, and his eyes flashed.\r\n\r\n"I have never been one to fear death," he said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut, as always before, he knew now that he was safe enough. His armed\r\ncitadel here was wholly safe from outside attack, even if the stricken\r\nmultitudes should find brief strength to try and assail him. His\r\nretainers, thinking they were safe, would remain at their posts. Poor\r\nfools. 

At the last, even they would be stricken and Groff would retreat\r\nup here. Impregnable, here in the tower and its neighbor little rooms,\r\nhe could maintain his unpolluted air, and eat the food and drink the\r\nwater which he had stored here in such abundance. Perhaps even, nature\r\nwould let him live the longer for his isolation.\r\n\r\nMaster of the earth. The man who owned everything. Pride swelled him\r\nagain as he thought of that poor little fool who had only wanted to\r\nmake himself the titular leader of the earth, and in his own fatuous\r\nconceit had written it all down in his little book.\r\n\r\n"You have good reason to fear me," Groff said. "You realize it now?

"\r\n\r\nThe young couple were white-faced and trembling as they clung to each\r\nother. And suddenly the girl murmured,\r\n\r\n"I--I pity you."\r\n\r\nGroff caught at it, with his sudden wild rage flooding him. "You lie!"\r\nhe rasped. "You are frightened. You are terrified of me and my revenge."\r\n\r\n"Revenge?" young Jac muttered. "I wonder what we have done to\r\nyou--except that we live and breathe and try to be happy." His arm held\r\nthe trembling girl closer; and he turned and gazed into her face, her\r\nmoist red lips quivering, her eyes like misted stars as she regarded\r\nhim. "If we are both to die," he murmured, "still we will have each\r\nother, Manya."\r\n\r\n"Yes," she whispered.\r\n\r\nThen it seemed that the youth was not quite so afraid as he\r\nstraightened and fronted Groff. "Your revenge, when you kill us both,\r\nis not quite complete," he said with a twisted smile.\r\n\r\nThey turned at Groff\'s gesture of dismissal. At the head of the great\r\nstaircase which went down from the tower, dominant with his power,\r\nGroff stood with his heavy ornamented robe tossed over one shoulder and\r\nall his emblazoned insignia dangling on his chest. The young couple\r\nwere still clinging to each other as they descended. Then they were a\r\nlittle blob, dwarfed by distance, dwindling into total insignificance.\r\nIt was only a trick of lighting of the great staircase, of course;\r\nbut suddenly, just before they vanished, it seemed that the light had\r\nmagnified them into something gigantic....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe thing was over at last. It was a week? 

Two weeks? Three weeks?\r\nGroff had kept no track of the time. Exhausted with exulting he lay\r\nback in his chair with his instruments around him. How wonderful it\r\nhad been. The ultimate conquest. The power of Groff and Groff alone.\r\nSo many times it had made him think of those other conquerors--those\r\nlittle men of history who had been thrilled by their trips of triumph\r\ninto some petty land their armies had devastated. That little man in\r\nhis aircar, gazing in triumph, swelling himself with his pride as he\r\ngazed at the death and destruction he had brought to just one petty\r\nnation in three weeks....\r\n\r\nGroff\'s triumph was over now. He had seen much of it, with his\r\ntelescopes ranging the city, and on his television mirrors before the\r\ntelevision went blank. It had been queer, how people, stricken so that\r\nthey knew they had only a few days to live, had rushed around bringing\r\ntheir families together. Queer that then they had not really seemed\r\nafraid. Queer how the churches had been crowded, with doomed people who\r\nclung together and had a strange look on their faces as though they\r\nwere not afraid to die....\r\n\r\nThen it was over. From the immense height and safety of his little\r\ntower Groff sat surveying his conquered world. The man who had\r\neverything. The ultimate of personal power. And what would he do with\r\nit now? Queer thought! It was so queer, so whimsical a thought that he\r\nchuckled, and then was laughing at it--laughing for so long that it\r\nleft him breathless. There was nobody here to hate. That was another\r\nqueer thought.\r\n\r\nWas it days, or weeks or years, that now he sat alone in his little\r\ntower, surveying his empty world? There was nothing to do but\r\ngloat with pride at the greatness of himself; and to laugh at the\r\nwhimsicality of his hungry need to be angry at his enemies who now did\r\nnot exist. He had tired of that. Then there were times when he thought\r\nit would be satisfying if he killed himself, like the man who had\r\nwritten the book and who could not live when he realized that the time\r\nhad come when no one feared him. But Groff found that he had not the\r\ncourage to do that.\r\n\r\nIt tired him to laugh so much, so that often now he sat, just anguished\r\nwith emptiness. It was queer how that vision of the young couple\r\ngoing down his staircase seemed always here to haunt and to puzzle\r\nhim. 

What had been about them that was so gigantic? The thought\r\nenraged him, because he knew now that it was something he might have\r\nwanted--something he had failed to get.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s The Man Who Killed the Earth, by Ray King\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n

The trouble was he had forgotten. He didn\'t remember where it\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nHe had been speeding past an off-color white dwarf when it happened.\r\nIf he had taken the trouble to look around, he would have seen that\r\nthe white star was going to explode. He knew a potential nova when he\r\ntook a good look at one. But after all these centuries he had grown\r\ncareless, and when the blast had come--the small star suddenly blazing\r\ninto a billion-fold brilliance--the penetrating radiation had hit him\r\nwith full intensity. There had been no ship to protect him, no clothing\r\nthat might serve as a shield. His kind had done away with such things\r\neons before, as they had learned to move through space by using some\r\nof the radiant energy that filled it.\r\n\r\nHe had blacked out completely.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to again, he was far past the nova, in the dazzling\r\nbrightness of a rarefied cloud of radiant hydrogen atoms. The nova\r\nitself had lost so much of its momentary brilliance that it was now\r\nindistinguishable from the myriads of other stars. He himself was\r\nspeeding on with feverish haste toward a nebular cluster a thousand\r\nlight years away.\r\n\r\nHe slowed down. He had the feeling that the distant cluster was not his\r\nproper destination. But what was? What star, what planet was the spot\r\nin space he had to find? And what was he supposed to do once he got\r\nthere?\r\n\r\nAnd who had given him the instructions? Where, in the vast immensity\r\nof the universe was the place called "home", the place where he could\r\nreturn for the information he had forgotten?\r\n\r\nHe didn\'t recall. He knew only, with that same distressing vagueness,\r\nthat somewhere there was something he had been ordered to do. And that\r\nonce given, the order had to be carried out.\r\n\r\nHe traveled aimlessly, by feeling alone. Time meant nothing to him as\r\nan individual, for his kind had long mastered the problems of age. But\r\ntime meant much to those he had been sent to--to do what? Was it to\r\nhelp? They must be waiting for him now. They must be wondering why he\r\ndidn\'t come.\r\n\r\nHe would have to hurry. Hurry to do something he didn\'t yet suspect,\r\nbut would sooner or later remember.\r\n\r\nAfter a few centuries, he began, in his anxiety, to talk to himself,\r\nas is the way of individuals too long alone. "That star cluster there\r\ncould be it," he said to himself hopefully, and veered toward the right.\r\n\r\n"Doesn\'t look familiar, though," he muttered. "Maybe if I would get\r\ncloser--"\r\n\r\nHe came close enough to see the thousands of stars as individuals, to\r\npick out the satellites circling the bright discs of light, to study\r\nthe pale planets themselves and their tiny subsatellites. As he turned\r\nhis attention from one to another, disappointment slowly filled him.\r\nNo, this was not the place. There was nothing in the configuration of\r\nthe stars, nothing in the size or position of the planets that sounded\r\na familiar chord in his consciousness. He would have to go further--or\r\nturn back.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe left the place behind him. The next time the same thing happened he\r\ndidn\'t have quite so much hope, and his disappointment was less keen.\r\nBut it was disappointment none the less. Time was passing, and they\r\nmust be waiting for him impatiently.\r\n\r\nAfter a while the hope and the disappointment both died away almost\r\ncompletely. The former shrank to a tiny spark that grew dimmer and\r\ndimmer as the centuries passed. He wondered if it would ever wink out\r\nentirely.\r\n\r\nIt was characteristic of him that the anxiety this caused was only\r\nfor those who were waiting, expecting him hourly, and wondering why\r\nhe didn\'t come. He had no sense of fear for himself, no feeling of\r\ndespairing loneliness that might be expected to arise from being so\r\nlong isolated in space. It was only that he would have liked some one\r\nto talk to, besides himself.\r\n\r\nOn a fair number of planets he found animal-like creatures in\r\ndifferent stages of development, and on a few he discovered life that\r\nwas intelligent. It was with these that he had a renewed feeling of\r\nanticipation, the spark of hope glowing momentarily before it faded\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"It\'s intelligent life I\'ve got to find," he told himself. "But where?"\r\n\r\nHis astronomical memory, insofar as it covered the post-nova\r\nperiod, was perfect, and he paid more attention to the details of\r\nstar-and-planet configuration than he had ever done before. Gradually\r\na star-map formed in his mind, a map that covered enormous distances\r\nof space. Those places he had investigated and eliminated from\r\nconsideration were slowly crossed off. It was a large needle he had to\r\nfind, and his own powers were considerable, but the haystack he had to\r\nsearch was infinite. There was no telling how many more centuries would\r\npass before he found it.\r\n\r\nAnd then another thought struck him. They\'d know back home that\r\nsomething had gone wrong. Would they send someone else to do the job in\r\nhis place?\r\n\r\nHe rather doubted it. He had a vague feeling that there weren\'t many\r\nwith his own peculiar talents. 

What had to be done had to be done by\r\nhim, or left undone altogether.\r\n\r\nMore time passed. And one day, when the space charted on his brain-map\r\nhad grown to vast dimensions, and the spark of hope had become so tiny\r\nthat he was not quite sure any longer that it was there at all, he\r\nnoted from a distance a galaxy that seemed familiar.\r\n\r\n"That\'s it!" he cried. "That\'s it!"\r\n\r\nThe spark flared, and as he sped toward the galaxy it became a flame.\r\nIt was a lens-shaped assemblage of stars, with two small spiral arms\r\ncomposed of a few million stars each, and it was seemingly not too\r\ndifferent from millions of other galaxies he had passed in the course\r\nof all those centuries. But to him, seeking so desperately, this galaxy\r\nwas unique. It was the right one. He coursed through it from spiral arm\r\nto spiral arm, and now there could be no doubt. The star he wanted was\r\nsmall and yellowish, far from the center of the lens. It had a rather\r\nelaborate planetary system, which he recognized at once.\r\n\r\nThis was it. The third planet, the one with a single subsatellite, was\r\nthe one he had been sent to find. To find, and perhaps to help. But how?\r\n\r\nThe finding of the planet had solved one problem. So far it had given\r\nhim not a hint toward the solution of the second--the reason why he had\r\nbeen sent here.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was life on this ball of mud and water, a great deal of life,\r\nboth vegetable and animal. And some of the latter could, without too\r\ngreat a distortion of the truth, be called intelligent. 

It had raised\r\ncities, tunneled into mountains, changed the appearance of sections of\r\nthe planet itself. It was to this intelligent life that he had been\r\nsent.\r\n\r\nA dim memory of the need for caution kept him from letting himself be\r\nseen. "I\'d only frighten them," he thought. "I\'ll have to investigate\r\nthoroughly before I reveal myself. And maybe the investigation will\r\nremind me of what I have to do.

"\r\n\r\nThe first thing was to come down to earth. Choosing the dark side of\r\nthe planet, shaded from the central sun by its own bulk, he shrank his\r\nbody and let himself drop in the gravitational field. From time to time\r\nhe slowed his fall in order to keep from flaming through the atmosphere\r\nand attracting their attention. And at a thousand feet above the\r\nsurface he came to a complete stop, hovering over a city, and making up\r\nhis mind where to land.\r\n\r\nSomething droned toward him through the air, colored lights winking\r\non and off. He darted downward and to one side. Where the city lights\r\nfaded out, he let himself fall all the way to the ground.\r\n\r\nHe was off a dimly lit highway. Small metal vehicles ran along it,\r\ntheir lights momentarily tearing apart the darkness ahead of them. A\r\nglance through the metal at the creatures inside the vehicles gave him\r\na queer thrill. Yes, these were the ones he had been sent to.\r\n\r\nQuickly reshaping his body and clothing himself so that he seemed to\r\nbe one of them, he began to walk along the highway. Cars sped past him,\r\npicking him out in their headlights. None of them stopped, but he had\r\ntime to probe their minds and listen to their language.\r\n\r\nWhat he found was not pleasant. Among all the feelings which controlled\r\ntheir thoughts, fear was easiest to detect. And along with the fear\r\nwere hatred and envy and greed, anxiety and guilt. Oddly enough, there\r\nwere also hope and affection for each other, but it was the worse\r\nfeelings that predominated. There was no doubt that they needed help.\r\n\r\nThat didn\'t make any clearer, however, what he had to do. He had an\r\nidea that it was not his mission to work out a detailed solution. 

He\r\nhad to do some simple thing, something--\r\n\r\nThe two men were lying in wait, either for him or for some other\r\npedestrian they judged sufficiently unwary. He sensed them long before\r\nthe first one stepped out toward him, a cigarette in one hand and what\r\nwas supposed to be an ingratiating look on the brutal face.\r\n\r\n"Got a match, bud?"\r\n\r\nThe other man suddenly plunged at him from the side, an arm wrapping\r\nitself around his neck. The assailant tried to bend him back, the\r\nforearm cutting across his windpipe. The arm of the first man swung, a\r\nrough fist smashing at his face.\r\n\r\nThen the two assailants screamed in pain and terror. Where they had\r\ntouched him, fist and arm broke into flame. Both men turned from him in\r\nhorror, and ran off wildly, as if to get away from themselves.\r\n\r\nHe hadn\'t meant to hurt them, but they had contrived their own\r\npunishment. Perhaps--no, that wasn\'t it. 

He wasn\'t here to punish\r\neither.\r\n\r\nHe walked along, and soon he found himself entering the city. A man in\r\na blue uniform watched him suspiciously and ordered him gruffly to get\r\nmoving.\r\n\r\n"I am moving," he said pleasantly.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you get wise with me," said the bluecoat, and raised a\r\nthreatening club.\r\n\r\nHe paid no attention to the club and kept on, toward the heart of the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nWhat he saw only confirmed the impression he had obtained from the\r\nminds of the men and women in the cars. Too many thoughts were mean and\r\nignoble, arising only from selfish and vicious desires. 

Many of those\r\nwho saw him seemed to sense his strangeness, and moved toward him with\r\na single impulse--to take advantage of his ignorance. Men spoke to him\r\nout of the sides of their mouths, offering him bargains. Women offered\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n"_Look, Mac, this stuff is hot, see? Just came off a truck_--"\r\n\r\n"_Wanta look at some nice pictures, Mister?_"\r\n\r\n"_I can give you a good address, Bud._"\r\n\r\n"_Out for a good time, Jack?_"\r\n\r\nThe planet was sick. Had he been sent to cure it?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe came to an area of broad lighted streets. Lights glittered\r\neverywhere, attracting the attention of those around him by going on\r\nand off. Great posters advertised the attractions inside places of\r\namusement.\r\n\r\nHe entered one of them, an astonished ticket-collector calling after\r\nhim, "Hey, where\'s your ticket, Bud?" But there was something about him\r\nthat prevented the man from pursuing.\r\n\r\nHe lost himself in the darkness and watched the screen. 

Here, in\r\nbrief and vivid form, was pictured the life of the planet. Women in\r\nbathing suits plunged into a pool and formed a pattern which imitated\r\nsensuously the petals of an unfolding rose. A small animal leaped\r\nthrough hoops and climbed a ladder. Groups of men drove against each\r\nother for possession of an object which they kicked occasionally\r\ninto the air. An elderly man looked grim and made a speech into a\r\nmicrophone. And then a film showed the main business of the planet,\r\nwhich seemed to be the killing of its supposedly intelligent\r\ninhabitants. Bombs exploded, planes crashed, desperate lines of men ran\r\nforward to meet their deaths.\r\n\r\nSomething quickened in his mind. He almost remembered now. This was\r\nwhat he had come here about.\r\n\r\nHis will moved, and the theatre vanished behind him. Now he was on the\r\nbattlefield itself.\r\n\r\nThe reality was worse than the image, far worse. Here were not only the\r\nroars of the great guns, but the curses and screams of the wounded, the\r\ngasps of the dying. Here were not only horrible sights and sounds, but\r\nthe odors of death--the sharp nitrogenous fragrance of explosives, the\r\nheavy sulfurous smoke of burning oil, the sickening smell of sweating\r\nor decaying flesh.\r\n\r\nA cloud came into being from the explosion of a mortar shell, and two\r\nmen dropped to the ground. In answer to the mortar, the flaring barrel\r\nof a tank gun spoke hoarsely, and half the crew of the mortar fell in\r\nturn. 

But there seemed no end to this deadly dialogue. The next moment\r\nthere came the burst of a bomb from a low-flying plane, and the tank\r\nhalf turned over on its side, a heap of smoking steel.\r\n\r\nHe knew at last why he had been sent here. He knew now what he had to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nHe ripped the flaring-mouthed gun from the tank. His hands twisted the\r\nthick metal into a shape it had never known before, bent it into a\r\nstrange curve, fashioned it so that it would emit overtones to chill\r\nthe souls of those who heard it. His brain charged the instrument with\r\nthe energy of his own mind, energy that would send its voice to the far\r\ncorners of this diseased planet, and leave not a single individual deaf\r\nto its dreaded tones.\r\n\r\nPutting the improvised horn to his lips, Gabriel blew the call for\r\nwhich the planet had so long been waiting.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _No matter what the future, one factor must always be\r\nreckoned with--the ingenuity of the human animal._]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two men attacked the thick tree trunk with a weary savagery. In the\r\nbright sunlight, glistening spatters of sweat flew from them as the old\r\naxes bit alternately into the wood.\r\n\r\nBlackie stood nearby, on the gravel shoulder of the highway, rubbing his\r\nshort beard as he considered the depth of the white notch. Turning his\r\nbroad, tanned face to glance along the patched and cracked concrete to\r\nwhere squat Vito kept watch, he caught the latter\'s eye and beckoned.\r\n\r\n"Okay, Sid--Mike. We\'ll take it a while."\r\n\r\nThe rhythm of the axe-strokes ceased. Red Mike swept the back of a\r\nforearm across the semi-shaven stubble that set him as something of a\r\ndandy. Wordlessly, big Sid ambled up the road to replace Vito.\r\n\r\n"Pretty soon, now," boasted Mike, eyeing the cut with satisfaction.\r\n"Think it\'ll bring them?"\r\n\r\n"Sure," replied Blackie, spitting on his hands and lifting one of the\r\nworn tools. "That\'s what they\'re for."\r\n\r\n"Funny," mused Mike, "how some keep going an\' others bust. These musta\r\nbeen workin\' since I was a little kid--since before the last blitz."\r\n\r\n"Aw, they don\'t hafta do much. \'Cept in winter when they come out to\r\nclear snow, all they do is put in a patch now an\' then."\r\n\r\nMike stared moodily at the weathered surface of the highway and edged\r\nback to avoid the reflected heat.\r\n\r\n"It beats me how they know a spot has cracked."\r\n\r\n"I guess there\'s machines to run the machines," sighed Blackie. "I\r\ndunno; I was too young. Okay, Vito?

"\r\n\r\nThe relieving pair fell to. Mike stepped out of range of the flying\r\nchips to sit at the edge of the soft grass which was attempting another\r\ninvasion of the gravel shoulder. Propelled by the strength of Vito\'s\r\npowerful torso, a single chip spun through the air to his feet. He\r\npicked it up and held it to his nose. It had a good, clean smell.\r\n\r\nWhen at length the tree crashed down across the road, Blackie led them\r\nto the ambush he had chosen that morning. It was fifty yards up the road\r\ntoward the ruined city--off to the side where a clump of trees and\r\nbushes provided shade and concealment.\r\n\r\n"Wish we brought something to eat," Vito said.\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t know it would take so long to creep up on \'em this morning,"\r\nsaid Blackie. "The women\'ll have somethin\' when we get back."\r\n\r\n"They better," said Mike.\r\n\r\nHe measured a slender branch with his eye. After a moment, he pulled out\r\na hunting knife, worn thin by years of sharpening, and cut off a\r\nstraight section of the branch. He began whittling.\r\n\r\n"You damn\' fool!" Sid objected. "You want the busted spot on the tree to\r\nshow?"\r\n\r\n"Aw, _they_ ain\'t got the brains to notice."\r\n\r\n"The hell they ain\'t! It stands out like one o\' them old street signs.\r\nD\'ya think they can tell, Blackie?"\r\n\r\n"I dunno. 

Maybe." Blackie rose cautiously to peer over a bed of\r\nblackberry bushes. "Guess I\'ll skin up a tree an\' see if anything\'s in\r\nsight."\r\n\r\nHe hitched up his pants, looking for an easy place to climb. His blue\r\ndenims had been stoutly made, but weakened by many rips and patches, and\r\nhe did not want to rip them on a snag. It was becoming difficult to find\r\ngood, unrotted clothing in the old ruins.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChoosing a branch slightly over his head, he sprang for it, pulled,\r\nkicked against the trunk, and flowed up into the foliage with no\r\napparent effort. The others waited below. Sid glanced up occasionally,\r\nVito idly kicked at one of the clubs made from an old two-by-four.\r\n\r\nThe other lay beneath the piled jackets; but enough of the end protruded\r\nto show that they had been chopped from the same timber, gray-painted on\r\none side, stained and gouged on the other where boards had once been\r\nnailed. A coil of rope lay beside the axes.\r\n\r\nHigh in the upper branches, Blackie braced himself with negligent\r\nconfidence and stared along the concrete ribbon.\r\n\r\n_From here_, he thought, _you\'d almost think the place was still alive,\r\ninstead of crumbling around our ears._\r\n\r\nThe windows of the distant houses were dark, unglassed holes, but the\r\nsunlight made the masonry clean and shining. To Blackie, the ragged tops\r\nof most of the buildings were as natural as the tattered look of the few\r\npeople he knew. Beyond, toward the center of the city, was real evidence\r\nof his race\'s bygone might--a vast jumble of shattered stone and fused\r\nmetal. Queer weeds and mosses infected the area, but it would be\r\ncenturies before they could mask the desolation.\r\n\r\nBetter covered, were the heaps along the road, seemingly shoved just\r\nbeyond the gravel shoulders--mouldering mounds which legend said were\r\nonce machines to ride in along the pavement.\r\n\r\nSomething glinted at the bend of the highway. Blackie peered closer.\r\n\r\nHe swarmed down the tree from branch to branch, so lithely that the trio\r\nbelow hardly had the warning of the vibrating leaves before he dropped,\r\ncat-footed, among them.\r\n\r\n"They\'re comin\'!"\r\n\r\nHe shrugged quickly into his stained jacket, emulated in silent haste by\r\nthe others. Vito rubbed his hands down the hairy chest left revealed by\r\nhis open jacket and hefted one of the clubs. In his broad paws, it\r\nseemed light.\r\n\r\nThey were quiet, watching Sid peer out through narrowly parted brush of\r\nthe undergrowth. Blackie fidgeted behind him. Finally, he reached out as\r\nif to pull the other aside, but at that moment Sid released the bushes\r\nand crouched.\r\n\r\nThe others, catching his warning glance, fell prone, peering through\r\nshrubbery and around tree trunks with savage eyes.\r\n\r\nThe distant squawk of a jay became suddenly very clear, as did the\r\nsighing of a faint breeze through the leaves overhead. Then a new,\r\nclanking, humming sound intruded.\r\n\r\nA procession of three vehicles rolled along the highway at an unvarying\r\npace which took no account of patches or worn spots. They jounced in\r\nturn across a patch laid over a previous, unsuccessful patch, and halted\r\nbefore the felled tree. 

Two were bulldozers; the third was a light truck\r\nwith compartments for tools. No human figures were visible.\r\n\r\nA moment later, the working force appeared--a column of eight robots.\r\nThese deployed as they reached the obstacle, and explored like colossal\r\nants along its length.\r\n\r\n"What\'re they after?" asked Mike, whispering although he lay fifty yards\r\naway.\r\n\r\n"They\'re lookin\' over the job for whatever sends them out," Blackie\r\nwhispered back. "See those little lights stickin\' out the tops o\' their\r\nheads? 

I heard tell, once, that\'s how they\'re run."\r\n\r\nSome of the robots took saws from the truck and began to cut through the\r\ntree trunk. Others produced cables and huge hooks to attach the obstacle\r\nto the bulldozers.\r\n\r\n"Look at \'em go!" sighed Sid, hunching his stiff shoulders jealously.\r\n"Took us hours, an\' they\'re half done already."\r\n\r\nThey watched as the robots precisely severed the part of the tree that\r\nblocked the highway, going not one inch beyond the gravel shoulder, and\r\nhelped the bulldozers to tug it aside. On the opposite side of the\r\nconcrete, the shoulder tapered off into a six-foot drop. The log was\r\njockeyed around parallel to this ditch and rolled into it, amid a\r\nthrashing of branches and a spurting of small pebbles.\r\n\r\n"Glad we\'re on the high side," whispered Mike. "That thing \'ud squash a\r\nguy\'s guts right out!

"\r\n\r\n"Keep listenin\' to me," Blackie said, "an\' you\'ll keep on bein\' in the\r\nright place at the right time."\r\n\r\nMike raised his eyebrows at Vito, who thrust out his lower lip and\r\nnodded sagely. Sid grinned, but no one contradicted the boast.\r\n\r\n"They\'re linin\' up," Blackie warned tensely. "You guys ready? 

Where\'s\r\nthat rope?"\r\n\r\nSomeone thrust it into his hands. Still squinting at the scene on the\r\nhighway, he fumbled for the ends and held one out to Mike. The others\r\ngripped their clubs.\r\n\r\n"Now, remember!" ordered Blackie. "Me an\' Mike will trip up the last one\r\nin line. You two get in there quick an\' wallop him over the head--but\r\ngood!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t go away while we\'re doin\' it," said big Sid. "They won\'t chase\r\nya, but they look out fer themselves. I don\'t wanna get tossed twenty\r\nfeet again!"\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the others flicked toward the jagged white scar running down\r\nbehind Sid\'s right ear and under the collar of his jacket. Then they\r\nswung back to the road.\r\n\r\n"Good!" 

breathed Blackie. "The rollin\' stuff\'s goin\' first."\r\n\r\nThe truck and bulldozers set out toward the city, with the column of\r\nrobots marching a fair distance behind. The latter approached the\r\nambush--drew abreast--began to pass.\r\n\r\nBlackie raised himself to a crouch with just the tips of his fingers\r\nsteadying him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs the last robot plodded by, he surged out of the brush, joined to Red\r\nMike by their grips on the twenty feet of rope. They ran up behind the\r\nmarching machine, trailed by the others.\r\n\r\nIn his right hand, Blackie twirled the part of the rope hanging between\r\nhim and Mike. On the second swing, he got it over the head of the robot.\r\nHe saw Mike brace himself.\r\n\r\nThe robot staggered. It pivoted clumsily to its left, groping vaguely\r\nfor the hindrance. Mike and Blackie tugged again, and the machine wound\r\nup facing them in its efforts to maintain balance. Its companions\r\nmarched steadily along the road.\r\n\r\n"Switch ends!" barked Blackie.\r\n\r\nAlert, Mike tossed him the other end of the rope and caught Blackie\'s.\r\nThey ran past the robot on either side, looping it in. Blackie kept\r\ngoing until he was above the ditch. He wound a turn of rope about his\r\nforearm and plunged down the bank.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _With skill of long practice, they brought the robot\r\ndown._]\r\n\r\nA shower of gravel spattered after him as Mike jammed his heels into the\r\nshoulder of the highway to anchor the other end. Then he heard the\r\nbooming sound of the robot\'s fall.\r\n\r\nBlackie clawed his way up the bank. Vito and Sid were smashing furiously\r\nat the floundering machine. Mike danced about the melee with bared\r\nteeth, charging in once as if to leap upon the quarry with both feet.\r\nFrustrated by the peril of the whirling two-by-fours, he swept up\r\nhandfuls of gravel to hurl.\r\n\r\nBlackie turned to run for one of the axes. Just then, Sid struck home to\r\nthe head of the robot.\r\n\r\nSparks spat out amid a tinkle of glass. The machine ceased all motion.\r\n\r\n"All right!" panted Blackie. "All _right_! That\'s enough!"\r\n\r\nThey stepped back, snarls fading. 

A handful of gravel trickled through\r\nMike\'s fingers and pattered loudly on the concrete. Gradually, the men\r\nbegan to straighten up, seeing the robot as an inert heap of metal\r\nrather than as a weird beast in its death throes.\r\n\r\n"We better load up an\' get," said Blackie. "We wanna be over on the\r\ntrail if they send somethin\' up the road to look for _this_."\r\n\r\nVito dragged the robot off the highway by the head, and they began the\r\ntask of lashing it to the two-by-fours.\r\n\r\nIt was about two hours later when they plodded around a street corner\r\namong the ruins and stopped before a fairly intact building. By that\r\ntime, they had picked up an escort of dirty, half-clad children who ran\r\nahead to spread the news.\r\n\r\nTwo other men and a handful of women gathered around with eager\r\nexclamations. The hunters dropped their catch.\r\n\r\n"Better get to work on him," said Blackie, glancing at the sky. "Be dark\r\nsoon."\r\n\r\nThe men who had remained as guards ran inside the entrance of polished\r\ngranite and brought out tools: hammers, crowbars, hatchets. Behind them\r\nhurried women with basins and large cans. The original four, weary from\r\nthe weight of the robot despite frequent pauses on the trail, stepped\r\nback.\r\n\r\n"Where first, Blackie?" asked one of the men, waiting for the women to\r\nuntangle the rope and timbers.\r\n\r\n"Try all the joints. After that, we\'ll crack him open down the middle\r\nfor the main supply tank.

"\r\n\r\nHe watched the metal give way under the blows. As the robot was\r\ndismembered, the fluid that had lubricated the complex mechanism flowed\r\nfrom its wounds and was poured by the women into a five-gallon can.\r\n\r\n"Bring a cupful, Judy," Blackie told his woman, a wiry blond girl. "I\r\nwanna see if it\'s as good as the last.

"\r\n\r\nHe lit a stick at the fire as they crossed the littered, once-ornate\r\nlobby, and she followed him down a dim hall. He pulled aside the skins\r\nthat covered their doorway, then stumbled his way to the table. The\r\nwindow was still uncovered against the night chill, but it looked out on\r\na courtyard shadowed by towering walls. To eyes adjusted to the sunny\r\nstreet, the room was dark.\r\n\r\nJudy poured the oil into the makeshift lamp, waited for the rag wick to\r\nsoak, and held it out to Blackie. He lit the wick from his stick.\r\n\r\n"It burns real good, Blackie," the girl said, wrinkling her nose against\r\nthe first oily smoke. "Gee, you\'re smart to catch one the first day\r\nout."\r\n\r\n"Tell them other dames to watch how they use it!" he warned. 

"This\r\noughta last a month or more when we get him all emptied."\r\n\r\nHe blew out the dying flame on the stick and dropped the charred wood\r\nthoughtfully to the floor.\r\n\r\n"Naw, I ain\'t so smart," he admitted, "or I\'d figure a way to make one\r\nof them work the garden for us. Maybe someday--but _this_ kind won\'t do\r\nnothin\' but fix that goddam road, an\' what good\'s that to anybody?"\r\n\r\nHis woman moved the burning lamp carefully to the center of the table.\r\n\r\n"Anyway, it\'s gonna be better\'n last winter," she said. "We\'ll have\r\nlights now."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


"The rich get richer and the poor stay\r\npoor."\r\n\r\n"The wallpaper," Stahl smoothly proceeded, "is a replica of Italian\r\nmurals. If you adjust your focus properly the flat columns become\r\nsolids through the art of vanishing-point perspective."\r\n\r\n"Excellent period distortion of Greek styles," said Tinker, studying\r\nthe columns. "And those three chairs are fine copies of Chippendale.\r\nYou\'re to be complimented on your taste in everything, Stahl."\r\n\r\n"You really know ancient designs," Stahl said. "Genuine old copies are\r\neven scarcer than their originals. And originals, of course, can never\r\nbe quite as good."\r\n\r\n"Sometimes I don\'t see why," Smith muttered.\r\n\r\nThey all looked shocked. "Smith, you need a checkup," Tinker advised.\r\n"You sound rundown. How can we progress without imitating past\r\nachievements?

"\r\n\r\n"A little rundown," Smith admitted, "but.... Oh, let\'s forget it."\r\n\r\n"Let\'s," Stahl nodded, striving to recapture the pair\'s attention as\r\nthey went on through the Suite. "Notice the paintings. Those two are\r\nexcellent pseudo-Braques and in the last room were fine fakes of Van\r\nGogh, Picasso and Chardin. In fact," he pointed toward a Gauguin-like\r\nnude, all flattened sensuousness, "that one\'s as close to a real\r\nGauguin as an imitation can go without being a mere reproduction."\r\n\r\nThey all gasped and even Smith shook his head reverently. "To be _that_\r\nclose to the real thing! It\'s all you\'d ever need."\r\n\r\n"Becoming more possible all the time." Tinker grinned suggestively\r\nat Mrs. Stahl. 

She looked back, mildly interested. "We\'ll get there\r\neventually."\r\n\r\nHappily oblivious to everything but his collections, Stahl led them\r\ninto the library. One wall, covered with rows of book spines, swung\r\naround to reveal a well-stocked bar. There was also a large bar across\r\nthe room which quickly became a library of real books and recording\r\nsystems.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not much for eating and drinking," Smith protested feebly.\r\n\r\n"Who is?" Mrs. 

Stahl laughed. "But this must be a special occasion for\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nEyes bulging nervously, Smith ran his fingers through his luxuriant\r\nhair and sighed, "Special it is. All right."\r\n\r\nStahl casually mixed drinks for them all and sipped an Old Fashioned.\r\n"I\'ve concentrated somewhat more on the twentieth century of the Old\r\nTimes than any other," he said. "A particularly intriguing century, I\r\nfind, although not crucial like the twenty-first, of course."\r\n\r\n"_The_ crucial one," Tinker protested.\r\n\r\n"As a fellow antiquarian, I must beg to differ, sir."\r\n\r\n"What about rocket travel, Mr. Stahl? When did that begin?"\r\n\r\n"Old hat," he yawned.\r\n\r\n"And atomic energy?"\r\n\r\n"Same applies there. 

Look, Tinker, don\'t get me wrong. I love the\r\nperiod. But, objectively viewed, the twenty-first makes the great\r\ndifference."\r\n\r\n"And what about duplication of life functions, like the mechanical\r\nheart? That really got started in the twentieth."\r\n\r\n"Absolutely right," Smith nodded vigorously.\r\n\r\n"All strictly mechanical," Stahl sighed. "But the twenty-first turned\r\nthe study of pain and pleasure itself from an art into a true science."\r\n\r\n"No, no," scoffed the cyberneticist.\r\n\r\nStahl pounded the bar. "All right, I\'m going to prove it by putting on\r\nan All-Sense Feeliescope of Thomas Dyall. It\'s fully sense-adapted, so\r\nit should pick up perfectly."\r\n\r\n"Hope it isn\'t noisy," said Smith.\r\n\r\n"It\'s _beautiful_," answered Mary Stahl. "I could listen to it all day."\r\n\r\nThe odor of damp, new-mown grass filled the room and another more\r\nelusive scent mingled with it. _Entry of June 3rd, 2068_, said an\r\nimpersonal, mechanical voice, _from the journal of Thomas Dyall,\r\nelected World\'s First Poet Laureate in 2089_. A warm rich bass took\r\nover:\r\n\r\n    This morning I rode far out to reach open countryside in the\r\n    preserved areas to replenish my stock of sensory experiences. As\r\n    I was walking along through the woods, the most delicious scent\r\n    struck my nostrils. I immediately recognized new-mown grass in\r\n    it but the factor making the true difference escaped me until I\r\n    realized the faint odor belonged to roses. At that point, my\r\n    senses reeling with delight, I composed in my mind most of my\r\n    long poem, _The Nature of Nature_, grasping intuitively an\r\n    experience more intense, more valuable, than any "real" one. I\r\n    say _intuitively_ because I still thought the odor was merely\r\n    that of grass and roses. A minute afterwards, though, I came\r\n    into a clearing, spotted a forest ranger\'s cottage there and\r\n    discovered that the scent was from a recently-improved insecticide\r\n    that the ranger\'s wife was using in the living room. There was\r\n    little grass in the area and not a single rose!\r\n\r\n_The following note_, interrupted the monotone voice, _was added by\r\nthe author in the year 2116_:\r\n\r\n    Here in "real" life the great guiding principle of my future was\r\n    brought home to me. The well-done imitation of a thing was better\r\n    than the thing itself! This was the lesson I had to disseminate for\r\n    all humanity.\r\n\r\n"Interesting," Tinker said, "although we all know now that one thing\r\ncannot be substituted for. Also--"\r\n\r\n"No discussion now," pleaded Smith. 

"You need a while to consider all\r\nthat. Anyway, I\'ve been thinking about your bill, Stahl. That wasn\'t a\r\nfold on Washington\'s eyelid, just a tiny inkstain. It\'s _genuine_."\r\n\r\n"It can\'t be," Stahl snapped and angrily led them back to the first\r\nroom. "Tinker, I want you as my witness."\r\n\r\nHe handed the bill around and Smith had to concede it was really\r\ncounterfeit. "What\'s that next one?" 

he asked.\r\n\r\n"A ten." Stahl hesitated, then took it off the pile along with three\r\nothers and passed them to the visitors, showing off fine points of\r\nimitation. When he collected the bills he carefully made certain there\r\nwere still five and locked them up again.\r\n\r\n"What about another drink?" Smith asked hastily.\r\n\r\n"No." Tinker sat down in a large chair. "Let\'s straighten out\r\nsomething right now, Stahl. Dyall was making the first crude statement\r\nof an obvious truth. If we have a pleasant sensation it doesn\'t matter\r\nwhether it\'s caused by a rose or a chemical imitation of a rose or by\r\nmaking a brain imagine a rose--doesn\'t matter except that the real rose\r\nitself is the hardest thing to control. So it can\'t be as intensely\r\nreal as its imitations."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Tinker, isn\'t that crucial enough for you?" Mrs. 

Stahl asked. Her\r\nvoice was so rich and warmly rounded that Smith stared wonderingly at\r\nher, as if trying to fathom an alien tongue.\r\n\r\n"Not quite," Tinker shrugged. "Stahl, you\'re discussing the smallest\r\naspect of the three-part equation, Stimulus + Stimulated Body =\r\nExperience. Your poet was saying certain changes in Stimulus would\r\nstill give a Stimulated Body the same Experience as the original. But\r\nthe philosophers and cyberneticists, they already suspected something\r\nmore radical. If the Stimulated Body was properly changed, the same\r\nStimulus could give different Bodies the same Experience. In other\r\nwords, a properly-arranged process would have the same Experience as\r\nthe life function for which it was substituted."\r\n\r\n"Now then," he went on, "all life reproduces itself, right? Well,\r\nthey finally figured the most important thing to reproduce was a\r\nman\'s Experience itself, not any particular form of Stimulated Body.\r\nOf course we have higher ideals. We want the Stimulated Body to be as\r\nnearly like what it was as possible--then we can have the best of _all_\r\npossible worlds."\r\n\r\n"Some people," Smith grumbled, "don\'t get their fair share of that\r\nbest.

"\r\n\r\n"Anyway I hate _all_ theories," said Mrs. Stahl.\r\n\r\nStahl disregarded them as he stared at his cashbox. "My money," he said\r\nominously, "has been changed!"\r\n\r\nThe two visitors exchanged nervous glances. "That\'s not possible," said\r\nTinker.\r\n\r\n"It _is_. Somebody\'s palmed a real one as a substitute!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s very unfair," Smith protested. "We came here as guests,\r\nstrangers to you and to each other. We\'ve given you the correct degree\r\nof envious admiration and now you show your gratitude for our human\r\nreaction by saying we\'re deranged!"\r\n\r\nStahl was unmoved. 

"I still say it\'s been stolen." He opened the\r\nbox. "See--the dollar\'s different! When the people of the Old Times\r\nmade us their heirs and children they left piles of this real stuff\r\naround along with almost everything else they\'d made. It\'s practically\r\nworthless!

"\r\n\r\nTinker frowned uncertainly. "If it makes you feel better I\'ll submit\r\nto a lie-detector. 

I hope you\'re capable of feeling shame when it\r\nproves my innocence!"\r\n\r\n"Good enough," said Stahl, turning expectantly to his other guest. As\r\nhe waited, Smith pulled back a little.\r\n\r\n"Well?" Mary smiled, moving a little toward him.\r\n\r\nSmith leaped away from her, heading toward an open window, but the\r\nothers moved faster and grabbed him before he reached the wall.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter with you anyway?" Tinker grunted, straining to hold\r\nhim. "The window\'s _painted_ on the wall!"\r\n\r\nSmith slumped forward in despair as Stahl triumphantly wormed the\r\nvalued counterfeit from his pocket. "I can\'t do anything right," Smith\r\nwailed. "I heard about this collection and thought I could manage to\r\nget one little thing for myself. I haven\'t been given much else by\r\nlife.

"\r\n\r\n"You--you defective!" Stahl shouted.\r\n\r\nSmith only slumped further forward. "How can I help it? The Monte Carlo\r\ncomputer gave me one of the last places for advanced altering and I\r\nhave to wait and wait. Compared to you, I\'m still a half-breed!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t hand me that," Stahl snapped. "I didn\'t mean physical defects.\r\nYou look as normal as anyone else."\r\n\r\n"No, darling, I think he\'s telling the truth," Mary said\r\nsympathetically. "When altering began it was only skin-deep for all of\r\nus."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll bet you\'re sixty per cent altered already," Smith cried out.\r\n"It\'s my bad luck to be only twenty-five per cent so far. All I can do\r\nis look at her and wonder why the two of you make such a fuss."\r\n\r\nThe cyberneticist tried to calm him. "Your turn\'s coming."\r\n\r\n"I have to find out what it\'s about sooner than that!"\r\n\r\nTinker sighed. "I\'ll try to get your number advanced."\r\n\r\n"Let him wait his turn," Stahl said coldly. "He\'s faking a lot anyway."\r\n\r\nAt that Smith broke free from them and pressed his back to the optical\r\nillusion window. "Don\'t come closer," he warned. "I don\'t have much to\r\nlose.

"\r\n\r\nThey stopped a few feet away and waited. Suddenly he raised his left\r\nhand to his face and dug the long nails in a semicircle into his flesh.\r\nAs a thin stream of locally circulated blood gushed out, he dug deeper\r\nand the eyeball fell forward, quivering, on his cheek.\r\n\r\n"He was telling the truth!" Stahl gasped, pointing at the glittering\r\nmetal bits within the eyesocket. A glowing wire was slowly evaporating\r\non the retinal plate as optical feedback collapsed.\r\n\r\nTinker, all professional competence now, helped Smith to a chair.\r\n"We\'ll be able to repair you in a month," he said, "because you\'ve\r\na simpler arrangement, and I can promise you\'ll have as good an\r\nelectro-chemical near-cortex as anybody. And the other more interesting\r\nchanges too."\r\n\r\nStahl glanced at his wife, then, as she nodded back, slowly put his\r\nprecious counterfeit into the dangling hand. He was pleased to see\r\nenough consciousness was still functioning enough for the fingers to\r\nclose greedily around it. "Keep it," he said, "you deserve it more than\r\nme."\r\n\r\nSuddenly he realised he was feeling not only shame but pity too! It was\r\nthe first time for pity--and that meant he was one step further on his\r\nown journey.\r\n\r\nHow far that journey had already taken him! For, when their brilliant\r\nlabors had dehumanized them, the humans had possessed sufficient\r\nunderstanding to pass the dead world on to the superior wisdom of their\r\ncreations. If _they_ had been unable to foresee what would eventually\r\nhappen, Stahl and his fellow robots could. Some day the supreme\r\nknowledge and the supreme feeling would be perfectly wedded, the day\r\nthey became truly humanoid copies of their makers.\r\n\r\nHe moved forward, Tinker following him, to help his fellow creature\r\ncloser to that common final destiny.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n

Minor spelling and typographical\r\n    errors have been corrected without note.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCircus\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"Just suppose," said Morgan, "that I _did_ believe you. Just for\r\nargument." He glanced up at the man across the restaurant table. "Where\r\nwould we go from here?"\r\n\r\nThe man shifted uneasily in his seat. He was silent, staring down at his\r\nplate. Not a strange-looking man, Morgan thought. Rather ordinary, in\r\nfact. A plain face, nose a little too long, fingers a little too dainty,\r\na suit that doesn\'t quite seem to fit, but all in all, a perfectly\r\nordinary looking man.\r\n\r\nMaybe _too_ ordinary, Morgan thought.\r\n\r\nFinally the man looked up. His eyes were dark, with a hunted look in\r\ntheir depths that chilled Morgan a little. "Where do we go? I don\'t\r\nknow. I\'ve tried to think it out, and I get nowhere. But you\'ve _got_ to\r\nbelieve me, Morgan. I\'m lost, I mean it. If I can\'t get help, I don\'t\r\nknow where it\'s going to end."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you where it\'s going to end," said Morgan. "It\'s going to end\r\nin a hospital. A mental hospital. They\'ll lock you up and they\'ll lose\r\nthe key somewhere." He poured himself another cup of coffee and sipped\r\nit, scalding hot. "And that," he added, "will be that."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe place was dark and almost empty. Overhead, a rotary fan swished\r\npatiently. The man across from Morgan ran a hand through his dark hair.\r\n"There must be some other way," he said. "There has to be."\r\n\r\n"All right, let\'s start from the beginning again," Morgan said. "Maybe\r\nwe can pin something down a little better. You say your name is\r\nParks--right?"\r\n\r\nThe man nodded. "Jefferson Haldeman Parks, if that helps any. Haldeman\r\nwas my mother\'s maiden name."\r\n\r\n"All right. 

And you got into town on Friday--right?"\r\n\r\nParks nodded.\r\n\r\n"Fine. Now go through the whole story again. What happened first?"\r\n\r\nThe man thought for a minute. "As I said, first there was a fall. About\r\ntwenty feet. I didn\'t break any bones, but I was shaken up and limping.\r\nThe fall was near the highway going to the George Washington Bridge. I\r\ngot over to the highway and tried to flag down a ride."\r\n\r\n"How did you feel? 

I mean, was there anything strange that you noticed?"\r\n\r\n"_Strange!_" Parks\' eyes widened. "I--I was speechless. At first I\r\nhadn\'t noticed too much--I was concerned with the fall, and whether I\r\nwas hurt or not. I didn\'t really think about much else until I hobbled\r\nup to that highway and saw those cars coming. Then I could hardly\r\nbelieve my eyes. I thought I was crazy. But a car stopped and asked me\r\nif I was going into the city, and I knew I wasn\'t crazy."\r\n\r\nMorgan\'s mouth took a grim line. "You understood the language?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. I don\'t see how I could have, but I did. We talked all the way\r\ninto New York--nothing very important, but we understood each other. His\r\nspeech had an odd sound, but--"\r\n\r\nMorgan nodded. "I know, I noticed. What did you do when you got to New\r\nYork?"\r\n\r\n"Well, obviously, I needed money. I had gold coin. There had been no way\r\nof knowing if it would be useful, but I\'d taken it on chance. I tried to\r\nuse it at a newsstand first, and the man wouldn\'t touch it. Asked me if\r\nI thought I was the U.S. Treasury or something. When he saw that I was\r\nserious, he sent me to a money lender, a hock shop, I think he called\r\nit. So I found a place--"\r\n\r\n"Let me see the coins."\r\n\r\nParks dropped two small gold discs on the table. They were perfectly\r\nsmooth and perfectly round, tapered by wear to a thin blunt edge. There\r\nwas no design on them, and no printing. Morgan looked up at the man\r\nsharply. "What did you get for these?"\r\n\r\nParks shrugged. "Too little, I suspect. Two dollars for the small one,\r\nfive for the larger."\r\n\r\n"You should have gone to a bank."\r\n\r\n"I know that now. I didn\'t then. Naturally, I assumed that with\r\neverything else so similar, principles of business would also be\r\nsimilar."\r\n\r\nMorgan sighed and leaned back in his chair. 

"Well, then what?"\r\n\r\nParks poured some more coffee. His face was very pale, Morgan thought,\r\nand his hands trembled as he raised the cup to his lips. Fright? Maybe.\r\nHard to tell. The man put down the cup and rubbed his forehead with the\r\nback of his hand. "First, I went to the mayor\'s office," he said. "I\r\nkept trying to think what anyone at home would do in my place. That\r\nseemed a good bet. I asked a policeman where it was, and then I went\r\nthere."\r\n\r\n"But you didn\'t get to see him."\r\n\r\n"No. I saw a secretary. She said the mayor was in conference, and that I\r\nwould have to have an appointment. She let me speak to another man, one\r\nof the mayor\'s assistants."\r\n\r\n"And you told him?"\r\n\r\n"No. I wanted to see the mayor himself. I thought that was the best\r\nthing to do. I waited for a couple of hours, until another assistant\r\ncame along and told me flatly that the mayor wouldn\'t see me unless I\r\nstated my business first." He drew in a deep breath. 

"So I stated it.\r\nAnd then I was gently but firmly ushered back into the street again."\r\n\r\n"They didn\'t believe you," said Morgan.\r\n\r\n"Not for a minute. They laughed in my face."\r\n\r\nMorgan nodded. "I\'m beginning to get the pattern. 

So what did you do\r\nnext?"\r\n\r\n"Next I tried the police. I got the same treatment there, only they\r\nweren\'t so gentle. 

They wouldn\'t listen either. They muttered something\r\nabout cranks and their crazy notions, and when they asked me where I\r\nlived, they thought I was--what did they call it?--a wise guy! Told me\r\nto get out and not come back with any more wild stories."\r\n\r\n"I see," said Morgan.\r\n\r\nJefferson Parks finished his last bite of pie and pushed the plate away.\r\n"By then I didn\'t know quite what to do. I\'d been prepared for almost\r\nanything excepting this. 

It was frightening. I tried to rationalize it,\r\nand then I quit trying. It wasn\'t that I attracted attention, or\r\nanything like that, quite the contrary. Nobody even looked at me, unless\r\nI said something to them. I began to look for things that were\r\n_different_, things that I could show them, and say, see, this proves\r\nthat I\'m telling the truth, look at it--" He looked up helplessly.\r\n\r\n"And what did you find?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing. Oh, little things, insignificant little things. Your\r\ncalendars, for instance. Naturally, I couldn\'t understand your frame of\r\nreference. And the coinage, you stamp your coins; we don\'t. And\r\ncigarettes. We don\'t have any such thing as tobacco." The man gave a\r\nshort laugh. "And your house dogs! We have little animals that look more\r\nlike rabbits than poodles. But there was nothing any more significant\r\nthan that. 

Absolutely nothing."\r\n\r\n"Except yourself," Morgan said.\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes. I thought that over carefully. I looked for differences,\r\nobvious ones. I couldn\'t find any. You can see that, just looking at me.\r\nSo I searched for more subtle things. Skin texture, fingerprints, bone\r\nstructure, body proportion. I still couldn\'t find anything. 

Then I went\r\nto a doctor."\r\n\r\nMorgan\'s eyebrows lifted. "Good," he said.\r\n\r\nParks shrugged tiredly. "Not really. He examined me. He practically took\r\nme apart. I carefully refrained from saying anything about who I was or\r\nwhere I came from; just said I wanted a complete physical examination,\r\nand let him go to it. He was thorough, and when he finished he patted me\r\non the back and said, \'Parks, you\'ve got nothing to worry about. You\'re\r\nas fine, strapping a specimen of a healthy human being as I\'ve ever\r\nseen.\' And that was that." Parks laughed bitterly. "I guess I was\r\nsupposed to be happy with the verdict, and instead I was ready to knock\r\nhim down. It was idiotic, it defied reason, it was infuriating."\r\n\r\nMorgan nodded sourly. "Because you\'re not a human being," he said.\r\n\r\n"That\'s right. I\'m not a human being at all."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"How did you happen to pick this planet, or this sun?" Morgan asked\r\ncuriously. "There must have been a million others to choose from."\r\n\r\nParks unbuttoned his collar and rubbed his stubbled chin unhappily. "I\r\ndidn\'t make the choice. 

Neither did anyone else. Travel by warp is a\r\nlittle different from travel by the rocket you fiction writers make so\r\nmuch of. With a rocket vehicle you pick your destination, make your\r\ncalculations, and off you go. The warp is blind flying, strictly blind.\r\nWe send an unmanned scanner ahead. It probes around more or less\r\nhit-or-miss until it locates something, somewhere, that looks habitable.\r\nWhen it spots a likely looking place, we keep a tight beam on it and\r\nsend through a manned scout." He grinned sourly. "Like me. If it looks\r\ngood to the scout, he signals back, and they leave the warp anchored for\r\na sort of permanent gateway until we can get a transport beam built. But\r\nwe can\'t control the directional and dimensional scope of the warp.\r\nThere are an infinity of ways it can go, until we have a guide beam\r\ntransmitting from the other side. Then we can just scan a segment of\r\nspace with the warp, and the scanner picks up the beam."\r\n\r\nHe shook his head wearily. 

"We\'re new at it, Morgan. We\'ve only tried a\r\nfew dozen runs. We\'re not too far ahead of you in technology. We\'ve been\r\nusing rocket vehicles just like yours for over a century. That\'s fine\r\nfor a solar system, but it\'s not much good for the stars. When the warp\r\nprinciple was discovered, it looked like the answer. But something went\r\nwrong, the scanner picked up this planet, and I was coming through, and\r\nthen something blew. Next thing I knew I was falling. When I tried to\r\nmake contact again, the scanner was gone!"\r\n\r\n"And you found things here the same as back home," said Morgan.\r\n\r\n"The same! Your planet and mine are practically twins. Similar cities,\r\nsimilar technology, everything. The people are the same, with precisely\r\nthe same anatomy and physiology, the same sort of laws, the same\r\ninstitutions, even compatible languages. Can\'t you see the importance of\r\nit? This planet is on the other side of the universe from mine, with the\r\nfirst intelligent life we\'ve yet encountered anywhere. But when I try to\r\ntell your people that I\'m a native of another star system, _they won\'t\r\nbelieve me_!"\r\n\r\n"Why should they?" 

asked Morgan. "You look like a human being. You talk\r\nlike one. You eat like one. You act like one. What you\'re asking them to\r\nbelieve is utterly incredible."\r\n\r\n"_But it\'s true._"\r\n\r\nMorgan shrugged. "So it\'s true. I won\'t argue with you. But as I asked\r\nbefore, even if I _did_ believe you, what do you expect _me_ to do about\r\nit? Why pick _me_, of all the people you\'ve seen?"\r\n\r\nThere was a desperate light in Parks\' eyes. "I was tired, tired of being\r\nlaughed at, tired of having people looking at me as though I\'d lost my\r\nwits when I tried to tell them the truth. You were here, you were alone,\r\nso I started talking. And then I found out you wrote stories." He looked\r\nup eagerly. "I\'ve got to get back, Morgan, somehow. My life is there,\r\nmy family. And think what it would mean to both of our worlds--contact\r\nwith another intelligent race! Combine our knowledges, our technologies,\r\nand we could explore the galaxy!"\r\n\r\nHe leaned forward, his thin face intense. "I need money and I need help.\r\nI know some of the mathematics of the warp principle, know some of the\r\ndesign, some of the power and wiring principles. You have engineers\r\nhere, technologists, physicists. They could fill in what I don\'t know\r\nand build a guide beam. But they won\'t do it if they don\'t believe me.\r\nYour government won\'t listen to me, they won\'t appropriate any money."\r\n\r\n"Of course they won\'t. They\'ve got a war or two on their hands, they\r\nhave public welfare, and atomic bombs, and rockets to the moon to sink\r\ntheir money into." Morgan stared at the man. 

"But what can _I_ do?"\r\n\r\n"You can _write_! That\'s what you can do. You can tell the world about\r\nme, you can tell exactly what has happened. I know how public interest\r\ncan be aroused in my world. It must be the same in yours."\r\n\r\nMorgan didn\'t move. He just stared. "How many people have you talked\r\nto?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"A dozen, a hundred, maybe a thousand."\r\n\r\n"And how many believed you?"\r\n\r\n"None."\r\n\r\n"You mean _nobody_ would believe you?"\r\n\r\n"_Not one soul._ Until I talked to you."\r\n\r\nAnd then Morgan was laughing, laughing bitterly, tears rolling down his\r\ncheeks. "And I\'m the one man who couldn\'t help you if my life depended\r\non it," he gasped.\r\n\r\n"You believe me?"\r\n\r\nMorgan nodded sadly. "I believe you. 

Yes. I think your warp brought you\r\nthrough to a parallel universe of your own planet, not to another star,\r\nbut I think you\'re telling the truth."\r\n\r\n"Then you _can_ help me.

"\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid not."\r\n\r\n"Why not?"\r\n\r\n"Because I\'d be worse than no help at all."\r\n\r\nJefferson Parks gripped the table, his knuckles white. "Why?" 

he cried\r\nhoarsely. "If you believe me, why can\'t you help me?"\r\n\r\nMorgan pointed to the magazine lying on the table. "I write, yes," he\r\nsaid sadly. "Ever read stories like this before?"\r\n\r\nParks picked up the magazine, glanced at the bright cover. "I barely\r\nlooked at it."\r\n\r\n"You should look more closely. I have a story in this issue. The readers\r\nthought it was very interesting," Morgan grinned. "Go ahead, look at\r\nit."\r\n\r\nThe stranger from the stars leafed through the magazine, stopped at a\r\npage that carried Roger Morgan\'s name. His eyes caught the first\r\nparagraph and he turned white. He set the magazine down with a trembling\r\nhand. "I see," he said, and the life was gone out of his voice. He\r\nspread the pages viciously, read the lines again.\r\n\r\nThe paragraph said:\r\n\r\n    "Just suppose," said Martin, "that I _did_ believe you. Just for\r\n    argument." He glanced up at the man across the table. 

"Where do we\r\n    go from here?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n


]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   It was the awfullest dream in the\r\n                 world, no doubt about it. In fact, it\r\n                seemed to be the only dream there was!\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was a morning type, so it was unusual that he should feel depressed\r\nin the morning. He tried to account for it, and could not.\r\n\r\nHe was a healthy man, so he ate a healthy breakfast. He was not too\r\ndepressed for that. And he listened unconsciously to the dark girl with\r\nthe musical voice. Often she ate at Cahill\'s in the mornings with her\r\ngirl friend.\r\n\r\nGrape juice, pineapple juice, orange juice, apple juice ... why did\r\npeople look at him suspiciously just because he took four or five sorts\r\nof juice for breakfast?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Agnes, it was ghastly. I was built like a sack. 

A sackful of skunk\r\ncabbage, I swear. And I was a green-brown color and had hair like a\r\nlatrine mop. Agnes, I was sick with misery. It just isn\'t possible for\r\nanybody to feel so low. I can\'t shake it at all. And the whole world\r\nwas like the underside of a log. It wasn\'t that, though. It wasn\'t just\r\none bunch of things. It was everything. It was a world where things\r\njust weren\'t worth living. I can\'t come out of it...."\r\n\r\n"Teresa, it was only a dream."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSausage, only four little links for an order. Did people think he was a\r\nglutton because he had four orders of sausage? It didn\'t seem like very\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\n"My mother was a monster. She was a wart-hoggish animal. And yet she\r\nwas still recognizable. How could my mother look like a wart-hog and\r\nstill look like my mother? Mama\'s pretty!"\r\n\r\n"Teresa, it was only a dream. 

Forget it."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe stares a man must suffer just to get a dozen pancakes on his plate!\r\nWhat was the matter with people who called four pancakes a tall stack?\r\nAnd what was odd about ordering a quarter of a pound of butter? It was\r\nbetter than having twenty of those little pats each on its coaster.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Agnes, we all of us had eyes that bugged out. 

And we stank! We were\r\nbloated, and all the time it rained a dirty green rain that smelled\r\nlike a four letter word. Good grief, girl! We had hair all over us\r\nwhere we weren\'t warts. And we talked like cracked crows. We had\r\ncrawlers. I itch just from thinking about it. And the dirty parts of\r\nthe dream I won\'t even tell you. I\'ve never felt so blue in my life. I\r\njust don\'t know how I\'ll make the day through."\r\n\r\n"Teresa, doll, how could a dream upset you so much?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere isn\'t a thing wrong with ordering three eggs sunny-side up, and\r\nthree over easy, and three poached ever so soft, and six of them\r\nscrambled. What law says a man should have all of his eggs fixed alike?\r\nNor is there anything wrong with ordering five cups of coffee. That way\r\nthe girl doesn\'t have to keep running over with refills.\r\n\r\nBascomb Swicegood liked to have bacon and waffles after the egg\r\ninterlude and the earlier courses. But he was nearly at the end of his\r\nbreakfast when he jumped up.\r\n\r\n"What did she say?"\r\n\r\nHe was surprised at the violence of his own voice.\r\n\r\n"What did who say, Mr. Swicegood?"\r\n\r\n"The girl that was just here, that just left with the other girl."\r\n\r\n"That was Teresa, and the other girl was Agnes. Or else that was Agnes\r\nand the other girl was Teresa. It depends on which girl you mean. 

I\r\ndon\'t know what either of them said."\r\n\r\nBascomb ran out into the street.\r\n\r\n"Girl, the girl who said it rained dirty green all the time, what\'s\r\nyour name?"\r\n\r\n"My name is Teresa. You\'ve met me four times. 

Every morning you look\r\nlike you never saw me before."\r\n\r\n"I\'m Agnes," said Agnes.\r\n\r\n"What did you mean it rained dirty green all the time? Tell me all\r\nabout it.

"\r\n\r\n"I will not, Mr. Swicegood. I was just telling a dream I had to Agnes.\r\nIt isn\'t any of your business."\r\n\r\n"Well, I have to hear all of it. Tell me everything you dreamed."\r\n\r\n"I will not. It was a dirty dream. It isn\'t any of your business. If\r\nyou weren\'t a friend of my Uncle Ed Kelly, I\'d call a policeman for\r\nyour bothering me."\r\n\r\n"Did you have things like live rats in your stomach to digest for you?\r\nDid they--"\r\n\r\n"Oh! How did you know? 

Get away from me. I _will_ call a policeman. Mr.\r\nMcCarty, this man is annoying me."\r\n\r\n"The devil he is, Miss Ananias. Old Bascomb just doesn\'t have it in him\r\nany more. There\'s no more harm in him than a lamp post."\r\n\r\n"Did the lamp posts have hair on them, Miss Teresa? Did they pant and\r\nswell and smell green--"\r\n\r\n"Oh! You couldn\'t know! 

You awful man!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m Agnes," said Agnes; but Teresa dragged Agnes away with her.\r\n\r\n"What is the lamp-post jag, Bascomb?" asked Officer Mossback McCarty.\r\n\r\n"Ah--I know what it is like to be in hell, Mossback. I dreamed of it\r\nlast night."\r\n\r\n"And well you should, a man who neglects his Easter duty year after\r\nyear. But the lamp-post jag? If it concerns anything on my beat, I have\r\nto know about it."\r\n\r\n"It seems that I had the same depressing dream as the young lady,\r\nidentical in every detail."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNot knowing what dreams are (and we do not know) we should not find\r\nit strange that two people might have the same dream. There may not\r\nbe enough of them to go around, and most dreams are forgotten in the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nBascomb Swicegood had forgotten his dismal dream. He could not account\r\nfor his state of depression until he heard Teresa Ananias telling\r\npieces of her own dream to Agnes Schoenapfel. Even then it came back to\r\nhim slowly at first, but afterwards with a rush.\r\n\r\nThe oddity wasn\'t that two people should have the same dream, but that\r\nthey should discover the coincidence, what with the thousands of people\r\nrunning around and most of the dreams forgotten.\r\n\r\nYet, if it were a coincidence, it was a multiplex one. On the night\r\nwhen it was first made manifest it must have been dreamed by quite a\r\nnumber of people in one medium-large city. There was a small piece in\r\nan afternoon paper. One doctor had five different worried patients\r\nwho had had dreams of rats in their stomachs, and hair growing on\r\nthe insides of their mouths. This was the first publication of the\r\nshared-dream phenomenon.\r\n\r\nThe squib did not mention the foul-green-rain background, but later\r\ninvestigation uncovered that this and other details were common to the\r\ndreams.\r\n\r\nBut it was a reporter named Willy Wagoner who really put the town on\r\nthe map. Until he did the job, the incidents and notices had been\r\nisolated. Doctor Herome Judas had been putting together some notes on\r\nthe Green-Rain Syndrome. Doctor Florenz Appian had been working up\r\nhis evidence on the Surex Ventriculus Trauma, and Professor Gideon\r\nGreathouse had come to some learned conclusions on the inner meaning of\r\nwarts. But it was Willy Wagoner who went to the people for it, and then\r\ngave his conclusions back to the people.\r\n\r\nWilly said that he had interviewed a thousand people at random. (He\r\nhadn\'t really; he had talked to about twenty. It takes longer than you\r\nmight think to interview a thousand people.) He reported that slightly\r\nmore than sixty-seven per cent had had a dream of the same repulsive\r\nworld. He reported that more than forty-four per cent had had the dream\r\nmore than once, thirty-two per cent more than twice, twenty-seven per\r\ncent more than three times. Many had had it every damned night. And\r\nmany refused frostily to answer questions on the subject at all.\r\n\r\nThis was ten days after Bascomb Swicegood had heard Teresa Ananias tell\r\nher dream to Agnes.\r\n\r\nWilly published the opinions of the three learned gentlemen above, and\r\nthe theories and comments of many more. He also appended a hatful of\r\nanswers he had received that were sheer levity.\r\n\r\nBut the phenomenon was not local. Wagoner\'s article was the first\r\ncomprehensive (or at least wordy) treatment of it, but only by hours.\r\nSimilar things were in other papers that very afternoon, and the next\r\nday.\r\n\r\nIt was more than a fad. Those who called it a fad fell silent after\r\nthey themselves experienced the dream. The suicide index arose\r\naround the country and the world. The thing was now international.\r\nThe cacophonous ditty _Green Rain_ was on all the jukes, as was _The\r\nWart-Hog Song_. People began to loathe themselves and each other.\r\nWomen feared that they would give birth to monsters. 

There were\r\nnew perversions committed in the name of the thing, and several\r\norgiastic societies were formed with the stomach rat as a symbol. All\r\nentertainment was forgotten, and this was the only topic.\r\n\r\nNervous disorders took a fearful rise as people tried to stay awake\r\nto avoid the abomination, and as they slept in spite of themselves and\r\nsuffered the degradation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is no joke to experience the same loathsome dream all night every\r\nnight. It had actually come to that. _All_ the people were dreaming it\r\n_all_ night _every_ night. It had passed from being a joke to being a\r\nuniversal menace. Even the sudden new millionaires who rushed their\r\ncures to the market were not happy. They also suffered whenever they\r\nslept, and they knew that their cures were not cures.\r\n\r\nThere were large amounts posted for anyone who could cure the populace\r\nof the wart-hog-people dreams. There was presidential edict and\r\ndictator decree, and military teams attacked the thing as a military\r\nproblem, but they were not able to subdue it.\r\n\r\nThen one night a nervous lady heard a voice in her noisome dream.\r\nIt was one of the repulsive cracked wart-hog voices. "You are not\r\ndreaming," said the voice. "This is the real world. But when you wake\r\nyou will be dreaming. That barefaced world is not a world at all. It is\r\nonly a dream. 

This is the real world." The lady awoke howling. And she\r\nhad not howled before, for she was a demure lady.\r\n\r\nNor was she the only one who awoke howling. There were hundreds,\r\nthen thousands, then millions. The voice spoke to all and engendered\r\na doubt. 

Which was the real world? Almost equal time was now spent in\r\neach, for the people had come to need more sleep and most of them had\r\narrived at spending a full twelve hours or more in the nightmarish\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n"It could be" was the title of a headlined article on the subject by\r\nthe same Professor Greathouse mentioned above. It could be, he said,\r\nthat the world on which the green rain fell incessantly was the real\r\nworld. It could be that the wart-hogs were real and the people a dream.\r\nIt could be that rats in the stomach were normal, and other methods of\r\ndigestion were chimerical.\r\n\r\nAnd then a very great man went on the air in worldwide broadcast with a\r\nspeech that was a ringing call for collective sanity. It was the hour\r\nof decision, he said. 

The decision would be made. Things were at an\r\nexact balance, and the balance would be tipped.\r\n\r\n"But we can decide. One way or the other, we _will_ decide. I implore\r\nyou all in the name of sanity that you decide right. One world or the\r\nother will be the world of tomorrow. One of them is real and one of\r\nthem is a dream. Both are with us now, and the favor can go to either.\r\nBut listen to me here: whichever one wins, the other _will have always\r\nbeen_ a dream, a momentary madness soon forgotten. I urge you to the\r\nsanity which in a measure I have lost myself. Yet in our darkened\r\ndilemma I feel that we yet have a choice. Choose!"\r\n\r\nAnd perhaps that was the turning point.\r\n\r\nThe mad dream disappeared as suddenly as it had appeared. The world\r\ncame back to normal with an embarrassed laugh. 

It was all over. It had\r\nlasted from its inception six weeks.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBascomb Swicegood, a morning type, felt excellent this morning. He\r\nbreakfasted at Cahill\'s, and he ordered heavily as always. And he\r\nlistened with half an ear to the conversation of two girls at the table\r\nnext to his.\r\n\r\n"But I should know you," he said.\r\n\r\n"Of course. I\'m Teresa."\r\n\r\n"I\'m Agnes," said Agnes.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Swicegood, how could you forget? It was when the dreams first\r\ncame, and you overheard me telling mine to Agnes. Then you ran after us\r\nin the street because you had had the same dream, and I wanted to have\r\nyou arrested. Weren\'t they horrible dreams? And have they ever found\r\nout what caused them?"\r\n\r\n"They were horrible, and they have not found out. They ascribe it to\r\ngroup mania, which is meaningless. And now there are those who say that\r\nthe dreams never came at all, and soon they will be nearly forgotten.\r\nBut the horror of them! The loneliness!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, we hadn\'t even pediculi to curry our body hair. We almost hadn\'t\r\nany body hair."\r\n\r\nTeresa was an attractive girl. She had a cute trick of popping the\r\nsmallest rat out of her mouth so it could see what was coming into\r\nher stomach. She was bulbous and beautiful. "Like a sackful of skunk\r\ncabbage," Bascomb murmured admiringly in his head, and then flushed\r\ngreen at his forwardness of phrase.\r\n\r\nTeresa had protuberances upon protuberances and warts on warts, and\r\nhair all over her where she wasn\'t warts and bumps. "Like a latrine\r\nmop!" sighed Bascomb with true admiration. The cracked clang of\r\nTeresa\'s voice was music in the early morning.\r\n\r\nAll was right with the earth again. Gone the hideous nightmare world\r\nwhen people had stood barefaced and lonely, without bodily friends\r\nor dependents. Gone that ghastly world of the sick blue sky and the\r\nnear-absence of entrancing odor.\r\n\r\nBascomb attacked manfully his plate of prime carrion. And outside the\r\npungent green rain fell incessantly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


"My God, what is\r\nit?" She looked up at him, bright-eyed.\r\n\r\n"Well, open it."\r\n\r\nDoris tore the ribbon and paper from the square package with her sharp\r\nnails, her bosom rising and falling. Larry stood watching her as she\r\nlifted the lid. He lit a cigarette and leaned against the wall.\r\n\r\n"A cuckoo clock!" Doris cried. "A real old cuckoo clock like my mother\r\nhad." She turned the clock over and over. "Just like my mother had, when\r\nPete was still alive." Her eyes sparkled with tears.\r\n\r\n"It\'s made in Germany," Larry said. After a moment he added, "Carl got\r\nit for me wholesale. 

He knows some guy in the clock business. Otherwise\r\nI wouldn\'t have--" He stopped.\r\n\r\nDoris made a funny little sound.\r\n\r\n"I mean, otherwise I wouldn\'t have been able to afford it." He scowled.\r\n"What\'s the matter with you? You\'ve got your clock, haven\'t you? Isn\'t\r\nthat what you want?"\r\n\r\nDoris sat holding onto the clock, her fingers pressed against the brown\r\nwood.\r\n\r\n"Well," Larry said, "what\'s the matter?"\r\n\r\nHe watched in amazement as she leaped up and ran from the room, still\r\nclutching the clock. He shook his head. 

"Never satisfied. They\'re all\r\nthat way. 

Never get enough."\r\n\r\nHe sat down at the table and finished his meal.\r\n\r\nThe cuckoo clock was not very large. It was hand-made, however, and\r\nthere were countless frets on it, little indentations and ornaments\r\nscored in the soft wood. Doris sat on the bed drying her eyes and\r\nwinding the clock. She set the hands by her wristwatch. Presently she\r\ncarefully moved the hands to two minutes of ten. She carried the clock\r\nover to the dresser and propped it up.\r\n\r\nThen she sat waiting, her hands twisted together in her lap--waiting for\r\nthe cuckoo to come out, for the hour to strike.\r\n\r\nAs she sat she thought about Larry and what he had said. And what she\r\nhad said, too, for that matter--not that she could be blamed for any of\r\nit. After all, she couldn\'t keep listening to him forever without\r\ndefending herself; you had to blow your own trumpet in the world.\r\n\r\nShe touched her handkerchief to her eyes suddenly. Why did he have to\r\nsay that, about getting it wholesale? Why did he have to spoil it all?\r\nIf he felt that way he needn\'t have got it in the first place. She\r\nclenched her fists. He was so mean, so damn mean.\r\n\r\nBut she was glad of the little clock sitting there ticking to itself,\r\nwith its funny grilled edges and the door. Inside the door was the\r\ncuckoo, waiting to come out. Was he listening, his head cocked on one\r\nside, listening to hear the clock strike so that he would know to come\r\nout?\r\n\r\nDid he sleep between hours? Well, she would soon see him: she could ask\r\nhim. And she would show the clock to Bob. He would love it; Bob loved\r\nold things, even old stamps and buttons. He liked to go with her to the\r\nstores. Of course, it was a little _awkward_, but Larry had been staying\r\nat the office so much, and that helped. If only Larry didn\'t call up\r\nsometimes to--\r\n\r\nThere was a whirr. The clock shuddered and all at once the door opened.\r\nThe cuckoo came out, sliding swiftly. He paused and looked around\r\nsolemnly, scrutinizing her, the room, the furniture.\r\n\r\nIt was the first time he had seen her, she realized, smiling to herself\r\nin pleasure. She stood up, coming toward him shyly. "Go on," she said.\r\n"I\'m waiting."\r\n\r\nThe cuckoo opened his bill. He whirred and chirped, quickly,\r\nrhythmically. Then, after a moment of contemplation, he retired. And the\r\ndoor snapped shut.\r\n\r\nShe was delighted. She clapped her hands and spun in a little circle. He\r\nwas marvelous, perfect! And the way he had looked around, studying her,\r\nsizing her up. He liked her; she was certain of it. And she, of course,\r\nloved him at once, completely. He was just what she had hoped would come\r\nout of the little door.\r\n\r\nDoris went to the clock. She bent over the little door, her lips close\r\nto the wood. "Do you hear me?" 

she whispered. "I think you\'re the most\r\nwonderful cuckoo in the world." She paused, embarrassed. "I hope you\'ll\r\nlike it here."\r\n\r\nThen she went downstairs again, slowly, her head high.\r\n\r\nLarry and the cuckoo clock really never got along well from the start.\r\nDoris said it was because he didn\'t wind it right, and it didn\'t like\r\nbeing only half-wound all the time. Larry turned the job of winding over\r\nto her; the cuckoo came out every quarter hour and ran the spring down\r\nwithout remorse, and someone had to be ever after it, winding it up\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nDoris did her best, but she forgot a good deal of the time. Then Larry\r\nwould throw his newspaper down with an elaborate weary motion and stand\r\nup. He would go into the dining-room where the clock was mounted on the\r\nwall over the fireplace. He would take the clock down and making sure\r\nthat he had his thumb over the little door, he would wind it up.\r\n\r\n"Why do you put your thumb over the door?" Doris asked once.\r\n\r\n"You\'re supposed to."\r\n\r\nShe raised an eyebrow. 

"Are you sure? I wonder if it isn\'t that you\r\ndon\'t want him to come out while you\'re standing so close."\r\n\r\n"Why not?"\r\n\r\n"Maybe you\'re afraid of him."\r\n\r\nLarry laughed. He put the clock back on the wall and gingerly removed\r\nhis thumb. When Doris wasn\'t looking he examined his thumb.\r\n\r\nThere was still a trace of the nick cut out of the soft part of it.\r\nWho--or what--had pecked at him?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne Saturday morning, when Larry was down at the office working over\r\nsome important special accounts, Bob Chambers came to the front porch\r\nand rang the bell.\r\n\r\nDoris was taking a quick shower. She dried herself and slipped into her\r\nrobe. When she opened the door Bob stepped inside, grinning.\r\n\r\n"Hi," he said, looking around.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all right. Larry\'s at the office."\r\n\r\n"Fine." Bob gazed at her slim legs below the hem of the robe. "How nice\r\nyou look today."\r\n\r\nShe laughed. "Be careful! Maybe I shouldn\'t let you in after all."\r\n\r\nThey looked at one another, half amused half frightened. Presently Bob\r\nsaid, "If you want, I\'ll--"\r\n\r\n"No, for God\'s sake." She caught hold of his sleeve. "Just get out of\r\nthe doorway so I can close it. Mrs. Peters across the street, you\r\nknow."\r\n\r\nShe closed the door. "And I want to show you something," she said. "You\r\nhaven\'t seen it."\r\n\r\nHe was interested. "An antique? Or what?"\r\n\r\nShe took his arm, leading him toward the dining-room. "You\'ll love it,\r\nBobby." She stopped, wide-eyed. "I hope you will. 

You must; you must\r\nlove it. It means so much to me--_he_ means so much."\r\n\r\n"He?" Bob frowned. "Who is he?"\r\n\r\nDoris laughed. "You\'re jealous! 

Come on." A moment later they stood\r\nbefore the clock, looking up at it. "He\'ll come out in a few minutes.\r\nWait until you see him. I know you two will get along just fine."\r\n\r\n"What does Larry think of him?"\r\n\r\n"They don\'t like each other. Sometimes when Larry\'s here he won\'t come\r\nout. Larry gets mad if he doesn\'t come out on time. He says--"\r\n\r\n"Says what?"\r\n\r\nDoris looked down. "He always says he\'s been robbed, even if he did get\r\nit wholesale." She brightened. "But I know he won\'t come out because he\r\ndoesn\'t like Larry. When I\'m here alone he comes right out for me, every\r\nfifteen minutes, even though he really only has to come out on the\r\nhour."\r\n\r\nShe gazed up at the clock. "He comes out for me because he wants to. We\r\ntalk; I tell him things. Of course, I\'d like to have him upstairs in my\r\nroom, but it wouldn\'t be right."\r\n\r\nThere was the sound of footsteps on the front porch. They looked at each\r\nother, horrified.\r\n\r\nLarry pushed the front door open, grunting. He set his briefcase down\r\nand took off his hat. Then he saw Bob for the first time.\r\n\r\n"Chambers. I\'ll be damned." His eyes narrowed. "What are you doing\r\nhere?" 

He came into the dining-room. Doris drew her robe about her\r\nhelplessly, backing away.\r\n\r\n"I--" Bob began. "That is, we--" He broke off, glancing at Doris.\r\nSuddenly the clock began to whirr. The cuckoo came rushing out, bursting\r\ninto sound. Larry moved toward him.\r\n\r\n"Shut that din off," he said. He raised his fist toward the clock. The\r\ncuckoo snapped into silence and retreated. The door closed. "That\'s\r\nbetter." Larry studied Doris and Bob, standing mutely together.\r\n\r\n"I came over to look at the clock," Bob said. "Doris told me that it\'s a\r\nrare antique and that--"\r\n\r\n"Nuts. I bought it myself." Larry walked up to him. "Get out of here."\r\nHe turned to Doris. "You too. And take that damn clock with you."\r\n\r\nHe paused, rubbing his chin. "No. Leave the clock here. It\'s mine; I\r\nbought it and paid for it."\r\n\r\nIn the weeks that followed after Doris left, Larry and the cuckoo clock\r\ngot along even worse than before. For one thing, the cuckoo stayed\r\ninside most of the time, sometimes even at twelve o\'clock when he should\r\nhave been busiest. And if he did come out at all he usually spoke only\r\nonce or twice, never the correct number of times. And there was a\r\nsullen, uncooperative note in his voice, a jarring sound that made Larry\r\nuneasy and a little angry.\r\n\r\nBut he kept the clock wound, because the house was very still and quiet\r\nand it got on his nerves not to hear someone running around, talking and\r\ndropping things. And even the whirring of a clock sounded good to him.\r\n\r\nBut he didn\'t like the cuckoo at all. And sometimes he spoke to him.\r\n\r\n"Listen," he said late one night to the closed little door. 

"I know you\r\ncan hear me. I ought to give you back to the Germans--back to the Black\r\nForest." He paced back and forth. 

"I wonder what they\'re doing now, the\r\ntwo of them. That young punk with his books and his antiques. A man\r\nshouldn\'t be interested in antiques; that\'s for women."\r\n\r\nHe set his jaw. 

"Isn\'t that right?"\r\n\r\nThe clock said nothing. Larry walked up in front of it. "Isn\'t that\r\nright?" he demanded. "Don\'t you have anything to say?"\r\n\r\nHe looked at the face of the clock. It was almost eleven, just a few\r\nseconds before the hour. "All right. I\'ll wait until eleven. Then I want\r\nto hear what you have to say. You\'ve been pretty quiet the last few\r\nweeks since she left."\r\n\r\nHe grinned wryly. "Maybe you don\'t like it here since she\'s gone." He\r\nscowled. "Well, I paid for you, and you\'re coming out whether you like\r\nit or not. You hear me?

"\r\n\r\nEleven o\'clock came. Far off, at the end of town, the great tower clock\r\nboomed sleepily to itself. But the little door remained shut. Nothing\r\nmoved. The minute hand passed on and the cuckoo did not stir. He was\r\nsomeplace inside the clock, beyond the door, silent and remote.\r\n\r\n"All right, if that\'s the way you feel," Larry murmured, his lips\r\ntwisting. "But it isn\'t fair. 

It\'s your job to come out. We all have to\r\ndo things we don\'t like."\r\n\r\nHe went unhappily into the kitchen and opened the great gleaming\r\nrefrigerator. As he poured himself a drink he thought about the clock.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt about it--the cuckoo should come out, Doris or no\r\nDoris. He had always liked her, from the very start. 

They had got along\r\nwell, the two of them. Probably he liked Bob too--probably he had seen\r\nenough of Bob to get to know him. They would be quite happy together,\r\nBob and Doris and the cuckoo.\r\n\r\nLarry finished his drink. He opened the drawer at the sink and took out\r\nthe hammer. He carried it carefully into the dining-room. The clock was\r\nticking gently to itself on the wall.\r\n\r\n"Look," he said, waving the hammer. "You know what I have here? 

You know\r\nwhat I\'m going to do with it? I\'m going to start on you--first." 

He\r\nsmiled. "Birds of a feather, that\'s what you are--the three of you."\r\n\r\nThe room was silent.\r\n\r\n"Are you coming out? Or do I have to come in and get you?"\r\n\r\nThe clock whirred a little.\r\n\r\n"I hear you in there. You\'ve got a lot of talking to do, enough for the\r\nlast three weeks. As I figure it, you owe me--"\r\n\r\nThe door opened. The cuckoo came out fast, straight at him. Larry was\r\nlooking down, his brow wrinkled in thought. He glanced up, and the\r\ncuckoo caught him squarely in the eye.\r\n\r\nDown he went, hammer and chair and everything, hitting the floor with a\r\ntremendous crash. For a moment the cuckoo paused, its small body poised\r\nrigidly. Then it went back inside its house. The door snapped tight-shut\r\nafter it.\r\n\r\nThe man lay on the floor, stretched out grotesquely, his head bent over\r\nto one side. Nothing moved or stirred. The room was completely silent,\r\nexcept, of course, for the ticking of the clock.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"I see," Doris said, her face tight. Bob put his arm around her,\r\nsteadying her.\r\n\r\n"Doctor," Bob said, "can I ask you something?"\r\n\r\n"Of course," the doctor said.\r\n\r\n"Is it very easy to break your neck, falling from so low a chair? It\r\nwasn\'t very far to fall. I wonder if it might not have been an accident.\r\nIs there any chance it might have been--"\r\n\r\n"Suicide?" the doctor rubbed his jaw. "I never heard of anyone\r\ncommitting suicide that way. It was an accident; I\'m positive."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mean suicide," Bob murmured under his breath, looking up at the\r\nclock on the wall. "I meant _something else_."\r\n\r\nBut no one heard him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ January 1954.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Computerman, I was the first to come out of deep freeze after we\r\nkicked clear of the Time-Warp. So I left the needles in my wrists--the\r\ntubes let me reach Brain One--and started punching data from the\r\ninstruments while my fingers were still half stiff. Finally, stiff\r\nfingers or not, I had all the data racked into the primary feed and\r\ndecided to check on the passengers. It amused me somewhat to note that\r\neven Brain One was strictly stalling for time when it came to figuring\r\nout where we were, and why. There was much buzzing and clicking but no\r\ntape feeding out, yet. 

Well, let the Brain figure it out. I had other\r\nthings to do.\r\n\r\nI strolled back to secondary freeze unit and checked Combatman. He\r\nwas on top of the heap, of course--as stiff as a fresh steak, so I\r\nstuck the needles in his wrists and switched to defrost. Automatic\r\nlift pulled him out and beneath him was the male Homonorm and the two\r\nfemale Homonorms. They came out, too, as the lifts worked, and pretty\r\nsoon the cabin looked like a morgue--or a cannibal\'s shop, if you\r\nprefer. Anyway, they were defrosting, so I left \'em to make a check\r\non Brain One and see what brilliant, if mechanical conclusion it had\r\nreached. Should be at least an hour before Combatman thawed--even with\r\nthe needles pumping.\r\n\r\nBrain One was feeding out tape now, slow as a snail considering its\r\ncycling rate, so I figured we were a long way from home. Okay with\r\nme--I\'d been around and knew that if we could get somewhere we could\r\nget back. But I wanted, and wanted bad, the data from Time-Warp gauges.\r\nSo I watched the tape, decoding mentally as it fed out and feeling, for\r\na Computerman, an emotion similar to impatience.\r\n\r\nWe were approaching--the Brain told me--a type three planet,\r\nradiations okay, atmosphere higher in oxygen than home, gravity\r\nslightly lighter in pull than normal--the same junk I\'d been picking\r\nup since we started colonizing. Land masses stable, water in the air,\r\nsemi-condensed. Good place for colonizing, and this pleased me. We were\r\nout to establish and leave the Homonorms for a generation, and Brain\r\nOne had figured all the details out while I was sitting in freeze like\r\na hamburger. So far, so good.\r\n\r\nOne thing annoyed, or puzzled me. I kept throwing data from TV and\r\nRadar into Feed-back and asking about population, life forms, land\r\ndenizens. All Brain One came up with was Insufficient Data. All right.\r\nIt would be just another routine landing on another distant planet.\r\nThen I heard the noise behind me and turned. Combatman stood in the\r\ndoorway, his skin still bluish from the freeze, his eyes just clearing\r\nand working into focus.\r\n\r\nI looked him over while he stood there, somewhat surprised--if one can\r\never be surprised at what his race did. He was hung with enough weapons\r\nto stop a division of Homonorms and I wondered, as I always did, at the\r\norigin of his race. His type always came drifting down from somewhere\r\nnorth, back home, and all our radar and planes had never found their\r\nhomeland. None of them ever talked with humans except to nose in on our\r\nexpeditions or break up our wars. This one was quite a specimen, maybe\r\nsix feet, about 180 pounds, with the quiet and arrogant strength of his\r\nrace. He took a deep breath, still leaning on the door frame.\r\n\r\n"Get me some whiskey," his voice was hoarse from disuse and the\r\nTime-Warp, "and get it now."\r\n\r\n"Now, see here," I began, "I\'m Computerman and in charge of this ship\r\nand...."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI didn\'t finish. With the quiet sureness of a jungle cat he had crossed\r\nthe room, taken a handful of my tunic and lifted me from the chair--in\r\nspite of the fact that gravity was nearly normal now because of the\r\nlanding jets. His voice was almost velvety.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you didn\'t hear me. I will repeat once more." He paused while\r\nI considered striking him and then, sensibly, changed my mind. "Get me\r\nsome whiskey." Then he dropped me back into the chair.\r\n\r\nI\'m not Computerman for nothing, so I computed the situation in maybe\r\na thousandth of a second. No one could push me around, so to prevent\r\nbeing pushed around I got him his whiskey. He knocked off about a half\r\npint at a swallow and in a few minutes his skin lost its bluish tinge.\r\nHe was awake, and his quick eyes swept the gauges and the TV-Radar\r\nimage.\r\n\r\n"When do we land?" He made no attempt to be courteous.\r\n\r\nI checked Brain One\'s tape, somewhat rattled. "Twenty-one minutes, four\r\nseconds," I started, resisting a strange impulse to say \'sir\', "Near\r\nwater, fresh, altitude under one mile from...."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all," he said. "Thanks." He left the room like a cat, crouching\r\nslightly as he went through the door, leaping through and backing\r\nagainst the wall, but fast, once he cleared. His weapons, all of them,\r\nwere so skillfully hung that he didn\'t make a sound. Somehow, I enjoyed\r\nwatching the play of those muscles and felt rather glad to have him\r\nalong, rough as he was. Outlying planets often have warlike combat\r\norganizations of their own, and Combatmen have saved many expeditions\r\nlike this. Something in their nature, or training--or both--seems to\r\nmake them invincible.\r\n\r\nI turned back to Brain One, checked the wiring on the denizen circuit\r\nand tried to get more information about possible inhabitants. No luck.\r\nEither there were none or they were so highly civilized they could\r\nblock off our probing rays. That had happened before, and it usually\r\nmeant a minor war. We always won, though we sometimes had to dig in and\r\nsend for the Control Fleet from home. The Fleet was run by Combatmen,\r\nthough no Homonorm had ever figured out how they eased into all the key\r\npositions. They were quite a race, all right.\r\n\r\nSo I sat watching the Radarscreen and the planet, enlarging rapidly.\r\nIt looked pretty good--about a quarter to a third land mass, I\r\nguessed--just like home. Combatman came back in the room, quietly.\r\n\r\n"Your pap-fed colonists are waking," he grunted. "Better go and\r\nwet-nurse them. 

They might catch cold." He sat down in the pilot\'s\r\nchair, much to my annoyance, and swilled away at his bottle. I noticed\r\nhe\'d replaced the original crock, and felt a moment\'s concern. After\r\nall, we depended for basic safety on his training, in the event of\r\nencountering hostility. He seemed utterly unconcerned as he lazily\r\nwatched the screen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Homonorms were doing all right, complaining as usual about the cold\r\nand asking silly questions about where we were and what year it was--or\r\nwould be at home. I ducked the questions, gave them their hypos and\r\nwent back to Brain One and the control panel. One look at controls and\r\nI started boiling; this was the last straw.\r\n\r\n"Now, goddamit," I started, "you can boss me around, but when it comes\r\nto...."\r\n\r\n"Shut up!"\r\n\r\n"I will not shut up...."\r\n\r\n"Okay." He was calm, leisurely, even--but before I realized it he was\r\nrising, crossed the room and I had an arm behind me. It didn\'t hurt but\r\nI felt pretty helpless. Completely helpless, to be truthful.\r\n\r\n"Could it be," he appeared to be bored, "that you are tired of having\r\ntwo arms?" He twisted slightly and I got the idea so I shut up, for\r\nthe second time. 

After a few seconds he sat down in my chair and had\r\nanother drink. When I could talk without sputtering I worked up my\r\nmildest voice.\r\n\r\n"Would you tell me," I almost choked on the next word, "_Please_, what\r\nin hell is the idea of circling at twenty miles, then dropping to ten\r\nand circling some more? We\'re wasting tons of fuel which we may need\r\nfor--"\r\n\r\n"Sure, brainy one, I\'ll tell you. I want to see what this place looks\r\nlike and _I\'m_ picking the landing site. Not you or that pile of\r\nrattling tin there." He gestured contemptuously at Brain One.\r\n\r\n"Pile of tin!" I couldn\'t say more so I went back to the rear and\r\nhelped the Homonorms find food and the simple plasticlothes they\'d be\r\nwearing. The ship lurched suddenly as it changed course at twenty miles\r\nand started circling. Even back here I could hear Brain One clacking in\r\nprotest over the conflicting instructions. That big lunk of a fighting\r\nman, of course, hadn\'t had sense enough to punch Clear and Recompute\r\nwhen he changed course and I could see the tape in my mind\'s eye\r\npouring frantically out with Data Please, Data Please....\r\n\r\nOh, well.\r\n\r\nHomonorms were thawing okay but crying like babies from Time-Warp\r\nsickness and space fright. I expected this and let them cry it out.\r\nMeanwhile I got busy with Sensory Receptors to see if anything we knew\r\nof could be blocking Brain One\'s circuits. This lack of info about\r\nthe denizens had me a little worried: it wasn\'t often Brain One came\r\nup with a blank, on any subject. It made me furious to be working\r\nlike mad here while that big oaf lounged in _my_ chair slopping up a\r\nyear\'s supply of stimulant. Defending the ship was his job; he should\r\nbe trying to find out what was doing below us. Instead, he sat around\r\nwatching Radarscreen just like he was watching the fights his race\r\nstaged back home for amusement.\r\n\r\nThe ship lurched violently. Then it lurched again. I started forward,\r\nworried, but the tailjets blasted and I slammed against a wall, pinned\r\ntight. The pressure cut my wind and I fainted. My last recollection was\r\nthe smell of scorching duralumin. We\'d been hit, by something.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen I revived, we were back at Gravnorm and I staggered, literally,\r\nback to control. My nose was still bleeding, and the Homonorms, of\r\ncourse, were still unconscious. Combatman sat comfortably in my padded\r\nchair, almost dreamily watching the screen. I felt a surge of anger,\r\nthen realized I was too feeble to support such an emotion. Remembering\r\nmy Psycho training I redirected to curiosity.\r\n\r\n"What...." my voice sounded pretty shaky and Combatman handed me the\r\nbottle, grinning.\r\n\r\n"Quite a race down there," he seemed pleased. Then he spat, expertly,\r\nthe result landing on the Radarscreen. "Can you work that thing?

"\r\n\r\n"Of course," I muttered, half-insulted.\r\n\r\n"Okay. We\'re at a hundred miles. Get that in focus as of two miles,\r\nslow the ship and prepare to hold stationary when I see what I want to\r\nknow."\r\n\r\nWeakly I fumbled with the controls, sniffling back the blood from my\r\nnose.\r\n\r\n"And turn off this tin god of yours," he continued. "That clacking\r\nracket annoys me." Casually, he kicked the part of Brain One nearest\r\nhim, which was the back of Wiring Panel Six.\r\n\r\n"Oh, _no_...." I began. But I did as I was told and ran Brain One\r\nthrough three clearing cycles, just to make sure. There was no telling\r\nwhat this lummox may have done in my absence. Now I\'d have to check\r\neverything and feed in the information all over again.\r\n\r\nCombatman leaned back in the chair like he expected dental work, and\r\nyawned luxuriously. He watched as the screen blurred and focused,\r\nblurred and focused. It was sweeping at two miles and the ship was\r\nslowing. We dropped tail down and Grav changed faster than the interior\r\nhull moved. Finally we settled, and coasted above this planet.\r\n\r\nThe ship lurched, twice this time almost simultaneously. Then it\r\nlurched steadily. Combatman threw the All Screens switch and watched\r\nthe Radar. By now, he was tense.\r\n\r\n"At a hundred miles...." he muttered. "What a race this is!"\r\n\r\nHe watched the screen with eyes that reminded me more of a cat\'s than a\r\nhuman\'s.\r\n\r\n"Stop!"\r\n\r\nFrom habit I threw the master Out Switch and everything stopped--our\r\nmotion coordinated precisely with the planet\'s, the Radar focused where\r\nit had been--and I got slammed against a wall again, of course. Well--I\r\nmight as well get used to it. 

When my eyes cleared I studied the\r\nimage. It was a rather crude city of considerable size, though poorly,\r\ndesigned from the light, ventilation and transport angle. There was\r\nconsiderable movement, apparently ground vehicles of some sort. 

Then I\r\nlooked at Combatman. His face was registering disbelief and something\r\nresembling alarm--though I\'d never heard of any of his race being\r\nreally frightened.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe missile warning light blinked frantically and the ship started\r\nlurching and pitching again. Combatman turned toward me and his face\r\nwas taut and urgent.\r\n\r\n"How soon can you get into Time-Warp?"\r\n\r\n"And--and _leave_?

"\r\n\r\n"Right, and the sooner the better." He flipped the height control\r\nand we moved, smoothly this time, up away from the missiles blasting\r\noutside our protective screen. "There\'ll be no colonizing done here.

"\r\n\r\n"But--but our orders were to...."\r\n\r\n"No colonizing here. Put your Homonorms back in the freezer and set up\r\nfor return. Do it now.

"\r\n\r\nStunned, I went rearward and told the people. They didn\'t like the\r\nidea very much, but regulations said that when the ship was attacked,\r\nCombatman was absolute boss. Then I returned. Combatman shot a glance\r\nat me and I nodded, then went to work on the Control panel, reversing\r\nthe whole set up.\r\n\r\n"When you finish I\'ll get in your ice box," Combatman said. "And when\r\nyou get out of Time-Warp destroy that wiring. None of your ships is to\r\ncome back here."\r\n\r\nI digested this slowly, wondering how to report to the council. "Why\r\nnot?" 

I ventured. "Perhaps with part of the Control Fleet...."\r\n\r\n"The whole Control Fleet wouldn\'t last two days on a desert of that\r\nworld, Brainboy," he said. His eyes misted faintly for a fraction of a\r\nsecond. "Those denizens, as you call them, are all members of my race,\r\nand this planet was my home--we called it Earth."\r\n\r\nHe yawned and strode to the rear and the freezer. At the portal he\r\nturned and grinned. "And don\'t ask me how we get back and forth. 

I\r\nmight get mad and have my whole family drop over--in-laws and all."\r\n\r\nI didn\'t really understand him, so went on with my wiring.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


There goes that old discourtesy again, eh?" the\r\nlittle man, Pettigill, said with a dry laugh. He scurried about the room\r\nlike a confused squirrel until he spotted a chair behind his desk. "My\r\nchair. My chair for you, Mr. Bartle!" Again the dry laugh.\r\n\r\n"Thanks, Mr. Pettigill."\r\n\r\n"Arthur. Call me Arthur. Formality really isn\'t necessary among Mid\r\nEchelon, do you think? Section Secretary Andrews has often requested I\r\ncall him Morton, but I just can\'t seem to bring myself to such\r\ninformality. After all, he is Sub-Prime Echelon. 

It makes one\r\nuncomfortable, shall we say, to step out of one\'s class?" He stopped\r\ntalking and the corners of his mouth dropped quickly as if he had just\r\nbeen given one minute to live. "You--you _are_ only Mid Echelon, aren\'t\r\nyou? I mean, if you are Sub-Prime, I shouldn\'t be--"\r\n\r\n"Relax, Mr. Pettigill--\'Arthur\'--I _am_ Mid Echelon. And I\'m only that\r\nbecause my father was a man of far more industry than I; I inherited my\r\nclassification."\r\n\r\n"So? Well, now. 

Interesting--very. He must have been a great man, a\r\ngreat man, Mr. Bartle."\r\n\r\n"So I am told, Arthur. But let\'s get on with it," Bartle said, taking\r\nsome scrap paper and a pencil stub from his tunic pocket. "Now, tell me\r\nabout yourself and the Melopsych Center."\r\n\r\n"Well," the little man began with a sigh and blinked his eyes peculiarly\r\nas though he were mentally shuffling events and facts like a deck of\r\ncards. "Well, I--my life would be of little interest, but the Center is\r\nof the utmost importance. That\'s it--I am no more than a physical\r\nextremity that functions in accord with the vital life that courses\r\nthrough the great physique of the Center! No more--I ask no more than to\r\nserve the Center and in turn, my fellow citizens, whether they be Prime,\r\nSub-Prime, Mid, or even Sub-Lower!

"\r\n\r\nHe stopped speaking, affecting a martyr-like pose. Bartle covered a\r\nsmile with his hand.\r\n\r\n"Well, Bartle, as you know, the Center--the Melopsych Center, a\r\nthoroughly inadequate name for the installation I might say--is the\r\npoint of broadcast for these many taped musical selections contrived by\r\nMass Psych as a therapeutic treatment for the various Echelon levels. It\r\nis the Great Psychiatrist--the Father Confessor. For where can one bare\r\none\'s soul, or soothe one\'s nerves and disposition frayed by a day\'s\r\nendeavor, better than in the tender yet firm embrace of music?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBartle was straining to follow the train of thought that was lost in the\r\ncamouflage of Pettigill\'s flowery phraseology.\r\n\r\n"You see all about you these many recorders, Mr. Bartle?"\r\n\r\nBartle nodded.\r\n\r\n"On those machines, sir, are spools of tape. Music tapes, all music. My\r\nheavens, every kind: classical music, jazz, western, all kinds of music.\r\nSome tapes are no more than a single melodious note, sustained for\r\nwhatever length of time necessary to relax and please the Echelon level\r\nhome it is being beamed to. Oh, I tell you, Mr. Bartle, when the last\r\ntape has expended itself for the day, as our service code suggests, I\r\nleave this great edifice with a feeling of profound pride in the fact\r\nthat I have so served my fellow man. You share that feeling too, don\'t\r\nyou Mr. Bartle?

"\r\n\r\nBartle shrugged. Pettigill paused and looked at the watch he carried on\r\na long chain attached to a clasp on his tunic.\r\n\r\n"A Benz chronometer, given to me by Section Secretary Andrews on the\r\ncompletion of my twenty-five years of service. It\'s radio-synchronized\r\nwith the master timepiece in Greenland. It gives me a feeling of close\r\ncommunion with my superiors, if you understand what I mean.

"\r\n\r\nBartle did not. He said, "Am I keeping you from your work? If I am, I\r\nbelieve I can fill in on most of this back at the paper; we have files\r\non the Center\'s operation."\r\n\r\nThe little man hurriedly put out a hand to restrain Bartle who was\r\neasing out of the chair.\r\n\r\n"Not yet, Mr. Bartle," he said, suddenly much more sober. Then his\r\nincongruous pomposity appeared again. "My gracious, no, you aren\'t\r\nkeeping me from my work. I just must start the Mid-Lower Echelon tape.\r\nIt won\'t take a moment. Tonight, they receive \'Concerto For Ass\'s\r\nJawbone.\' Sounds rather ridiculous, doesn\'t it? Be that as it may, there\r\nis a certain stimulation in its rhythmic cacophony. Aboriginality--yes,\r\nI would say it arouses a primitive exaltation."\r\n\r\nHe flicked a switch above the recorder, turned a knob, and pressed the\r\nstarter button on the machine. The tape began winding slowly from one\r\nspool to another.\r\n\r\n"Is it \'casting\'?" Bartle asked. "I don\'t hear a thing."\r\n\r\nPettigill laughed. "My stars, no; you can\'t hear it. See--" He pointed\r\nat a needle doing a staccato dance on the meter face of the machine.\r\n"That tells me everything is operating properly. Mass Psych advises us\r\nnever to listen to \'casts. The selections were designed by them for\r\nspecific social and intellectual levels. It could cause us to experience\r\na rather severe emotional disturbance."\r\n\r\nA peculiar look came over Bartle\'s face. "Is there ever a time when all\r\nthe machines run at once? That is, when every Echelon home is tuned to\r\nthe melopsych tapecasts?"\r\n\r\nPettigill registered surprise. "Why, certainly, Mr. 

Bartle. Don\'t you\r\nknow Amendment 34206-B specifically states that all Echelon homes must\r\nreceive music therapy at 2300 hours every night? Of course, different\r\ntapes to different homes.

"\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I mean."\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t you been abiding by the directive, Mr. Bartle?"\r\n\r\n"I told you I owed my classification to my father\'s industry. I am\r\ndefinitely lax in my duties."\r\n\r\nPettigill laughed--almost wickedly, Bartle thought.\r\n\r\n"What I\'m getting at, is," Bartle continued, "what if the wrong \'casts\r\nwere channeled into the various homes?"\r\n\r\n"I remind you, sir, I am in charge of the Center and have been for\r\nthirty years. Not even the slightest mistake of that nature has ever\r\noccurred during that time!"\r\n\r\n"That, I can believe, Pettigill," Bartle said, his voice edged with\r\nsarcasm. "But, hypothetically, if it were to happen, what would the\r\nreaction be?"\r\n\r\nThe little man fidgeted with his watch chain. Then he leaned close to\r\nBartle and said in a barely audible whisper, "This isn\'t for publication\r\nin your article, is it?"\r\n\r\n"You don\'t think the Government would allow that, do you? No, this is to\r\nsatisfy my own curiosity."\r\n\r\n"Well, since we\'re both Mid Echelon--brothers, so to speak--I suppose we\r\ncan share a secret. It will be disastrous! 

I firmly believe it will be\r\ndisastrous, Mr. Bartle!" He moved closer to the tall man. "I recall a\r\nsecret administrative directive we received here twenty years ago\r\nconcerning just that. In essence, it stated that, though music therapy\r\nhas its great advantages, if the pattern of performance were broken or\r\naltered, a definite erratic emotional reaction would develop on the part\r\nof the citizens! That was twenty years ago, and I shudder to think what\r\nmight be the response now; especially if the \'cast were completely\r\nforeign to the recipient." He gave a little shudder to emphasize the\r\nhorror of the occurrence. "It would make psychotics of the entire\r\ncitizenry! That\'s what would happen--a nation of psychotics!"\r\n\r\n"The fellow who didn\'t hear the \'miscast\' would be top dog, eh,\r\nPettigill? He could call his shots."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPettigill twirled the watch chain faster between a forefinger and thumb.\r\n"No, he\'d gain nothing," he said, staring as though hypnotized by the\r\nwhirling, gold chain. "It would take more than one _sane_ person to\r\ncontrol the derelict population. Perhaps--perhaps two," he mumbled.\r\n"Yes, I think perhaps two could."\r\n\r\n"You and who else, Pettigill?"\r\n\r\nPettigill stepped back and drew himself erect. "What? You actually\r\nentertain the idea th--" He laughed dryly. "Oh, you\'re pulling my leg,\r\neh, Mr. Bartle."\r\n\r\n"I suppose I am."\r\n\r\n"Well, such a remark gives one a jolt, if you know what I mean. Even\r\nthough we are speaking of a hypothetical occurrence, we must be cautious\r\nabout such talk, Mr. Bartle. Although our government is a benevolent\r\norganization, it _is_ ill-disposed toward such ideas." He cleared his\r\nthroat. 

"Now, is there anything else I can tell you about the Center?"\r\n\r\nBartle arose from the chair, stuffing the scrap paper and unused pencil\r\nback in his pocket. "Thanks, no," he said, "I think this\'ll cover it. Oh\r\nyes, the article will appear in this Sunday\'s edition. Thanks,\r\nPettigill, for giving me your time."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I wish to thank you, Mr. Bartle. Being featured in a _Bulletin_\r\narticle is the ultimate to a man such as I--a man whose only wishes are\r\nto serve his country and his brothers."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure you\'re doing both with great efficiency," Bartle said as he\r\napathetically shook Pettigill\'s hand and started toward the door.\r\n\r\n"A moment, Mr. Bartle--" the little man called.\r\n\r\nBartle stopped and turned.\r\n\r\n"I perceive, Mr. Bartle, you are a man of exceptional ability,"\r\nPettigill said and cleared his throat. "It seems a shame to waste such\r\ntalent; it should be directed toward some definite goal. Do you\r\nunderstand what I mean? After all, we\'re all brothers, you know. 

It\r\nwould be for my benefit as well as yours."\r\n\r\n"Sure, sure, \'brother\'," Bartle snorted and left.\r\n\r\nHe started for the paper office but decided to let the story go until\r\nmorning. What the hell, he had a stock format for all such articles. The\r\npeople were the same: selfless, heroic type, citizens working for the\r\nmutual good of all. Only the names were different. 

And yet, this\r\nPettigill had disturbed him. Perhaps it was something he had said that\r\nBartle could not remember.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe walked into his warm flat and extracted the pre-cooked meal from the\r\nelectroven. He ate with little relish, abstractly thinking of the\r\nfoolish little cog in the governmental machine he had talked with that\r\nafternoon. Or was Pettigill that foolish little cog? Bartle could not\r\nhelp but feel there was something deep inside him that did not show in\r\nthat wizened and seemingly open little face. He thought about it the\r\nrest of the evening.\r\n\r\nHe looked at the clock on the night table--2300 hours. "Pettigill\'s\r\nLullaby Hour," he thought. Bartle chuckled and switched off the bed\r\nlight. He was asleep before the puffs of air had escaped from under the\r\ncovers he pulled over himself.\r\n\r\nWhen the phone rang at 0300, Bartle was strangely not surprised,\r\nalthough, consciously, he was expecting no call.\r\n\r\n"Hello," he said sleepily.\r\n\r\n"Bartle? This is Pettigill." The voice _was_ Pettigill\'s but the\r\nnervous, timid, quality was gone. "I assume you did not hear the 2300\r\n\'cast?"\r\n\r\n"You assume correctly, Pettigill. 

What d\'you want?"\r\n\r\n"Come on over to the Center; we\'ll split a fifth of former Section\r\nSecretary Andrews\' Scotch."\r\n\r\n"What the hell do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Were you serious about that \'therapy revolution\' we were talking about\r\nthis afternoon?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m always serious. So what?"\r\n\r\n"Excellent, excellent," Pettigill laughed. "I\'ve spent thirty years just\r\nwaiting for such a man as you! No, I\'m serious, my cynical friend--what\r\nposition would you like in the new government?"\r\n\r\n"Let\'s see--why don\'t you make my descendants real peachy happy and make\r\nme, say, Administrator of Civilian Relations. That sounds big and\r\nimportant.

"\r\n\r\n"Fine, fine! Tell me, Bartle--how are your relations with psychotics?"\r\n\r\nBartle leaped to the floor. Instantly he recalled what Pettigill had\r\nsaid that had disturbed him. When they had been discussing the\r\nrepercussions of a miscast, Pettigill had said, "it _will_ be\r\ndisastrous" and not "it _would_ be disastrous." The devil had been\r\nplanning just such a thing for God knows how long!\r\n\r\n"How many of \'em, Pettigill?" Bartle asked.\r\n\r\n"A lot, Bartle, a lot," the little man answered. "I would say 170\r\nmillion! I might even say, a nation of psychotics!" He giggled again.\r\n\r\nA smile sliced through Bartle\'s sallow cheeks. "My relations with them\r\nwould be the best! Keep that Scotch handy, Pettigill. 

I\'ll be right\r\nover."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n


]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Don\'t wait to "Get \'em while they\'re hot."\r\n              By then, it is too late to get them of all!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe big bright doors of the office building parted with a pneumatic\r\n_whoosh_ and Robie glided onto Times Square. The crowd that had been\r\nwatching the fifty-foot-tall girl on the clothing billboard get\r\ndressed, or reading the latest news about the Hot Truce scrawl itself\r\nin yard-high script, hurried to look.\r\n\r\nRobie was still a novelty. Robie was fun. For a little while yet, he\r\ncould steal the show. But the attention did not make Robie proud. He\r\nhad no more emotions than the pink plastic giantess, who dressed and\r\nundressed endlessly whether there was a crowd or the street was empty,\r\nand who never once blinked her blue mechanical eyes. But she merely\r\ndrew business while Robie went out after it.\r\n\r\nFor Robie was the logical conclusion of the development of vending\r\nmachines. All the earlier ones had stood in one place, on a floor or\r\nhanging on a wall, and blankly delivered merchandise in return for\r\ncoins, whereas Robie searched for customers. He was the demonstration\r\nmodel of a line of sales robots to be manufactured by Shuler Vending\r\nMachines, provided the public invested enough in stocks to give the\r\ncompany capital to go into mass production.\r\n\r\nThe publicity Robie drew stimulated investments handsomely. It was\r\namusing to see the TV and newspaper coverage of Robie selling, but not\r\na fraction as much fun as being approached personally by him. Those\r\nwho were usually bought anywhere from one to five hundred shares, if\r\nthey had any money and foresight enough to see that sales robots would\r\neventually be on every street and highway in the country.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRobie radared the crowd, found that it surrounded him solidly, and\r\nstopped. With a carefully built-in sense of timing, he waited for the\r\ntension and expectation to mount before he began talking.\r\n\r\n"Say, Ma, he doesn\'t look like a robot at all," a child said. "He looks\r\nlike a turtle."\r\n\r\nWhich was not completely inaccurate. The lower part of Robie\'s body was\r\na metal hemisphere hemmed with sponge rubber and not quite touching the\r\nsidewalk. The upper was a metal box with black holes in it. The box\r\ncould swivel and duck.\r\n\r\nA chromium-bright hoopskirt with a turret on top.\r\n\r\n"Reminds me too much of the Little Joe Paratanks," a legless veteran\r\nof the Persian War muttered, and rapidly rolled himself away on wheels\r\nrather like Robie\'s.\r\n\r\nHis departure made it easier for some of those who knew about Robie to\r\nopen a path in the crowd. Robie headed straight for the gap. The crowd\r\nwhooped.\r\n\r\nRobie glided very slowly down the path, deftly jogging aside whenever\r\nhe got too close to ankles in skylon or sockassins. The rubber buffer\r\non his hoopskirt was merely an added safeguard.\r\n\r\nThe boy who had called Robie a turtle jumped in the middle of the path\r\nand stood his ground, grinning foxily.\r\n\r\nRobie stopped two feet short of him. The turret ducked. The crowd got\r\nquiet.\r\n\r\n"Hello, youngster," Robie said in a voice that was smooth as that of a\r\nTV star, and was, in fact, a recording of one.\r\n\r\nThe boy stopped smiling. "Hello," he whispered.\r\n\r\n"How old are you?" Robie asked.\r\n\r\n"Nine. No, eight."\r\n\r\n"That\'s nice," Robie observed. A metal arm shot down from his neck,\r\nstopped just short of the boy.\r\n\r\nThe boy jerked back.\r\n\r\n"For you," Robie said.\r\n\r\nThe boy gingerly took the red polly-lop from the neatly fashioned blunt\r\nmetal claws, and began to unwrap it.\r\n\r\n"Nothing to say?" asked Robie.\r\n\r\n"Uh--thank you."\r\n\r\nAfter a suitable pause, Robie continued. "And how about a nice\r\nrefreshing drink of Poppy Pop to go with your polly-lop?" The boy\r\nlifted his eyes, but didn\'t stop licking the candy. Robie waggled his\r\nclaws slightly. "Just give me a quarter and within five seconds--"\r\n\r\nA little girl wriggled out of the forest of legs. "Give me a polly-lop,\r\ntoo, Robie," she demanded.\r\n\r\n"Rita, come back here!" a woman in the third rank of the crowd called\r\nangrily.\r\n\r\nRobie scanned the newcomer gravely. His reference silhouettes were not\r\ngood enough to let him distinguish the sex of children, so he merely\r\nrepeated, "Hello, youngster."\r\n\r\n"Rita!"\r\n\r\n"Give me a polly-lop!"\r\n\r\nDisregarding both remarks, for a good salesman is single-minded and\r\ndoes not waste bait, Robie said winningly, "I\'ll bet you read _Junior\r\nSpace Killers_. Now I have here--"\r\n\r\n"Uh-uh, I\'m a girl. _He_ got a polly-lop."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the word "girl," Robie broke off. Rather ponderously, he said, "I\'ll\r\nbet you read _Gee-Gee Jones, Space Stripper_. Now I have here the\r\nlatest issue of that thrilling comic, not yet in the stationary vending\r\nmachines. Just give me fifty cents and within five--"\r\n\r\n"Please let me through. 

I\'m her mother."\r\n\r\nA young woman in the front rank drawled over her powder-sprayed\r\nshoulder, "I\'ll get her for you," and slithered out on six-inch\r\nplatform shoes. "Run away, children," she said nonchalantly. Lifting\r\nher arms behind her head, she pirouetted slowly before Robie to show\r\nhow much she did for her bolero half-jacket and her form-fitting slacks\r\nthat melted into skylon just above the knees. The little girl glared at\r\nher. She ended the pirouette in profile.\r\n\r\nAt this age-level, Robie\'s reference silhouettes permitted him to\r\ndistinguish sex, though with occasional amusing and embarrassing\r\nmiscalls. He whistled admiringly. The crowd cheered.\r\n\r\nSomeone remarked critically to a friend, "It would go over better if he\r\nwas built more like a real robot. You know, like a man.

"\r\n\r\nThe friend shook his head. "This way it\'s subtler."\r\n\r\nNo one in the crowd was watching the newscript overhead as it\r\nscribbled, "Ice Pack for Hot Truce? Vanadin hints Russ may yield on\r\nPakistan."\r\n\r\nRobie was saying, "... in the savage new glamor-tint we have christened\r\nMars Blood, complete with spray applicator and fit-all fingerstalls\r\nthat mask each finger completely except for the nail. Just give me five\r\ndollars--uncrumpled bills may be fed into the revolving rollers you see\r\nbeside my arm--and within five seconds--"\r\n\r\n"No, thanks, Robie," the young woman yawned.\r\n\r\n"Remember," Robie persisted, "for three more weeks, seductivizing Mars\r\nBlood will be unobtainable from any other robot or human vendor."\r\n\r\n"No, thanks.

"\r\n\r\nRobie scanned the crowd resourcefully. "Is there any gentleman\r\nhere ..." he began just as a woman elbowed her way through the front\r\nrank.\r\n\r\n"I told you to come back!" she snapped at the little girl.\r\n\r\n"But I didn\'t get my polly-lop!"\r\n\r\n"... who would care to...."\r\n\r\n"Rita!"\r\n\r\n"Robie cheated. Ow!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the young woman in the half bolero had scanned the nearby\r\ngentlemen on her own. Deciding that there was less than a fifty per\r\ncent chance of any of them accepting the proposition Robie seemed about\r\nto make, she took advantage of the scuffle to slither gracefully back\r\ninto the ranks. Once again the path was clear before Robie.\r\n\r\nHe paused, however, for a brief recapitulation of the more magical\r\nproperties of Mars Blood, including a telling phrase about "the\r\npassionate claws of a Martian sunrise."\r\n\r\nBut no one bought. It wasn\'t quite time. Soon enough silver coins would\r\nbe clinking, bills going through the rollers faster than laundry, and\r\nfive hundred people struggling for the privilege of having their money\r\ntaken away from them by America\'s first mobile sales robot.\r\n\r\nBut there were still some tricks that Robie had to do free, and one\r\ncertainly should enjoy those before starting the more expensive fun.\r\n\r\nSo Robie moved on until he reached the curb. The variation in level was\r\ninstantly sensed by his under-scanners. 

He stopped. His head began to\r\nswivel. The crowd watched in eager silence. This was Robie\'s best trick.\r\n\r\nRobie\'s head stopped swiveling. His scanners had found the traffic\r\nlight. It was green. Robie edged forward. But then the light turned\r\nred. Robie stopped again, still on the curb. The crowd softly _ahhed_\r\nits delight.\r\n\r\nIt was wonderful to be alive and watching Robie on such an exciting\r\nday. Alive and amused in the fresh, weather-controlled air between the\r\nlines of bright skyscrapers with their winking windows and under a sky\r\nso blue you could almost call it dark.\r\n\r\n(But way, way up, where the crowd could not see, the sky was darker\r\nstill. Purple-dark, with stars showing. And in that purple-dark, a\r\nsilver-green something, the color of a bud, plunged down at better than\r\nthree miles a second. The silver-green was a newly developed paint that\r\nfoiled radar.)\r\n\r\nRobie was saying, "While we wait for the light, there\'s time for\r\nyou youngsters to enjoy a nice refreshing Poppy Pop. Or for you\r\nadults--only those over five feet tall are eligible to buy--to enjoy\r\nan exciting Poppy Pop fizz. Just give me a quarter or--in the case of\r\nadults, one dollar and a quarter; I\'m licensed to dispense intoxicating\r\nliquors--and within five seconds...."\r\n\r\nBut that was not cutting it quite fine enough. Just three seconds\r\nlater, the silver-green bud bloomed above Manhattan into a globular\r\norange flower. The skyscrapers grew brighter and brighter still, the\r\nbrightness of the inside of the Sun. The windows winked blossoming\r\nwhite fire-flowers.\r\n\r\nThe crowd around Robie bloomed, too. Their clothes puffed into petals\r\nof flame. Their heads of hair were torches.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe orange flower grew, stem and blossom. The blast came. The winking\r\nwindows shattered tier by tier, became black holes. The walls bent,\r\nrocked, cracked. A stony dandruff flaked from their cornices. The\r\nflaming flowers on the sidewalk were all leveled at once. Robie was\r\nshoved ten feet. His metal hoopskirt dimpled, regained its shape.\r\n\r\nThe blast ended. The orange flower, grown vast, vanished overhead\r\non its huge, magic beanstalk. It grew dark and very still. 

The\r\ncornice-dandruff pattered down. A few small fragments rebounded from\r\nthe metal hoopskirt.\r\n\r\nRobie made some small, uncertain movements, as if feeling for broken\r\nbones. He was hunting for the traffic light, but it no longer shone\r\neither red or green.\r\n\r\nHe slowly scanned a full circle. There was nothing anywhere to\r\ninterest his reference silhouettes. 

Yet whenever he tried to move, his\r\nunder-scanners warned him of low obstructions. It was very puzzling.\r\n\r\nThe silence was disturbed by moans and a crackling sound, as faint at\r\nfirst as the scampering of distant rats.\r\n\r\nA seared man, his charred clothes fuming where the blast had blown out\r\nthe fire, rose from the curb. Robie scanned him.\r\n\r\n"Good day, sir," Robie said. "Would you care for a smoke? A truly cool\r\nsmoke? Now I have here a yet-unmarketed brand...."\r\n\r\nBut the customer had run away, screaming, and Robie never ran after\r\ncustomers, though he could follow them at a medium brisk roll. He\r\nworked his way along the curb where the man had sprawled, carefully\r\nkeeping his distance from the low obstructions, some of which writhed\r\nnow and then, forcing him to jog. Shortly he reached a fire hydrant.\r\nHe scanned it. His electronic vision, though it still worked, had been\r\nsomewhat blurred by the blast.\r\n\r\n"Hello, youngster," Robie said. Then, after a long pause, "Cat got your\r\ntongue? Well, I have a little present for you. A nice, lovely polly-lop.\r\n\r\n"Take it, youngster," he said after another pause. "It\'s for you. 

Don\'t\r\nbe afraid."\r\n\r\nHis attention was distracted by other customers, who began to rise\r\nup oddly here and there, twisting forms that confused his reference\r\nsilhouettes and would not stay to be scanned properly. One cried,\r\n"Water," but no quarter clinked in Robie\'s claws when he caught the\r\nword and suggested, "How about a nice refreshing drink of Poppy Pop?"\r\n\r\nThe rat-crackling of the flames had become a jungle muttering. The\r\nblind windows began to wink fire again.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA little girl marched, stepping neatly over arms and legs she did\r\nnot look at. A white dress and the once taller bodies around her had\r\nshielded her from the brilliance and the blast. Her eyes were fixed on\r\nRobie. In them was the same imperious confidence, though none of the\r\ndelight, with which she had watched him earlier.\r\n\r\n"Help me, Robie," she said. "I want my mother."\r\n\r\n"Hello, youngster," Robie said. "What would you like? Comics? 

Candy?"\r\n\r\n"Where is she, Robie? Take me to her."\r\n\r\n"Balloons? Would you like to watch me blow up a balloon?"\r\n\r\nThe little girl began to cry. The sound triggered off another of\r\nRobie\'s novelty circuits, a service feature that had brought in a lot\r\nof favorable publicity.\r\n\r\n"Is something wrong?" he asked. 

"Are you in trouble? Are you lost?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Robie. Take me to my mother."\r\n\r\n"Stay right here," Robie said reassuringly, "and don\'t be frightened.\r\nI will call a policeman." He whistled shrilly, twice.\r\n\r\nTime passed. Robie whistled again. 

The windows flared and roared. The\r\nlittle girl begged, "Take me away, Robie," and jumped onto a little\r\nstep in his hoopskirt.\r\n\r\n"Give me a dime," Robie said.\r\n\r\nThe little girl found one in her pocket and put it in his claws.\r\n\r\n"Your weight," Robie said, "is fifty-four and one-half pounds."\r\n\r\n"Have you seen my daughter, have you seen her?" a woman was\r\ncrying somewhere. "I left her watching that thing while I stepped\r\ninside--_Rita!_"\r\n\r\n"Robie helped me," the little girl began babbling at her. "He knew I\r\nwas lost. 

He even called the police, but they didn\'t come. He weighed\r\nme, too. 

Didn\'t you, Robie?"\r\n\r\nBut Robie had gone off to peddle Poppy Pop to the members of a rescue\r\nsquad which had just come around the corner, more robotlike in their\r\nasbestos suits than he in his metal skin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAcross the blazing face of the sun moved a round dark speck, a tiny,\r\none-man space ship. It was very small, very close, and utterly\r\nhelpless. The side facing the sun glowed dull red.\r\n\r\nInside, Jim MacDonald stood glumly regarding the thermometer on the\r\npilot compartment bulkhead. Sweat made dark patches on the light blue\r\nof his uniform and ran in beads down his forehead. He rubbed his arm\r\nacross his face. The thermometer read over two hundred. He shook his\r\nhead slowly. It couldn\'t be that hot, heat must be conducting along the\r\nmagnesium bulkhead to the instrument.\r\n\r\nJim ran his fingers through his hair to brush back the damp strands\r\nthat clung to his forehead. The hand came away with little droplets\r\nclinging to his fingertips. 

He wiped it across his pants, and tapped\r\nthe thermometer again. The pointer stayed where it was, stuck against\r\nthe peg.\r\n\r\n"About one forty-five," he guessed aloud, and turned to walk with a\r\nslow, dragging step across to the pilot\'s seat. Weakly he slumped down\r\nwith his arms dangling loose over the chair arms, knuckles almost\r\ntouching the deck. He sat very still trying to ignore the temperature\r\nin the compartment, but the hot stifle wrapped around him and his\r\nchest heaved in a sigh.\r\n\r\nJim MacDonald was done for and he knew it. The thermo-couple to the\r\noutside skin showed three thousand degrees. The inside cooling system\r\nhad not been built for this and had long since ceased to cope with the\r\nheat. There seemed to be no use continuing his grim little existence,\r\nor facing the worse smother of heat to come.\r\n\r\nYet, driven by the dull automatism of training and habit, he listlessly\r\nswung the stand with the ship\'s log over before him and noted his\r\ntemperature readings. Then he critically reread what he had already\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, he had been using the gravitational field of the sun\r\nas a booster to help fling the little ship from Earth to Venus. In the\r\nmighty field, a space warp had funneled out, caught him, and sucked the\r\nship toward the blazing maw.\r\n\r\nThe struggle to escape was a masterpiece of calculation. He had figured\r\nwith such a nicety that his fuel had run out just at the moment the\r\njet tubes at the rear became molten lumps on the ship\'s skin. He had\r\nescaped the warp. But it was a futile thing now, for the ship swung\r\naround the sun fuelless, inoperative, in a tight orbit that had a\r\nlittle initial inward momentum.\r\n\r\nHe had tried to radio for help, but radioing from where he was, was\r\nlike trying to signal from the heart of an atomic bomb; if a signal got\r\nthrough, it would be only a part of the meaningless jabber of static\r\nthat always came from here. And if the little black speck were seen,\r\nit would only be taken for a stray meteorite moving across the sun\'s\r\nincandescent face.\r\n\r\nThe ship was a little spherical world. It turned on its own axis once\r\nin an hour and twenty minutes. 

That was its little day. The orbit\r\nspiralled now a mere quarter million miles from the sun, one little\r\nyear to two earth days. It moved closer at a rate that accelerated a\r\nfew feet per second every second.\r\n\r\nEventually, said the impassive rows of equations in the log, the inward\r\nmovement would stop, as keeping the same speed in a smaller circle, the\r\nship\'s centrifugal force increased to set up an equilibrium. But that\r\npoint would be three thousand miles below the sun\'s surface. 

The ship\r\nwould never reach it. Jim MacDonald inhabited a doomed little world.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe chuckled. He even had a moon. The natural physical function of a few\r\nminutes before had left a jagged little chunk of ice swinging around\r\nthe ship, outside the waste lock on the side away from the sun. 

But\r\nthat wouldn\'t last long. It would pass into the hot light, and vanish\r\nin a puff of steam.\r\n\r\nNow the plastic fittings of the compartment began to send up a\r\nnostril stinging stench. Jim leafed over a few pages in the log to\r\nthe page printed at the top: ... SUGGESTIONS FOR REDESIGN OF\r\nSPACE-SHIPS.\r\n\r\nUnder his note, _Enlarge cooling systems_, he wrote, _Replace\r\nurea formaldehyde plastics with metals, and insulate compartment\r\nthermometers from bulkheads._\r\n\r\nFeeling foolish at the useless act of writing that which no one would\r\never read, Jim swung the log away. His tongue peeled from the roof\r\nof his mouth like a strip of adhesive tape and he dragged across the\r\ncompartment for a drink. 

Glancing toward the sun, he held his aluminum\r\ncup under the spout and pressed the hot button gingerly. Although the\r\nwindows on that side were blanked out almost purple, the sun\'s horizon\r\nglared through in a heaving mass of leaping gassy prominences.\r\n\r\nJim turned away, his face wrinkling into a grimace. Across the\r\ncompartment a little cabinet held a pistol. It would be a simple sane\r\nthing to walk across there, take out the pistol and bring this to a\r\nsudden stop. He stepped toward it, then turned away ashamed. Spacemen\r\ndidn\'t think like that.\r\n\r\nAhead of the ship something flared into incandescent brilliance. Waves\r\nof force pounded on the front, the deck heaved. Jim sprawled on his\r\nface and skidded over under the instrument panel, his cup clattering\r\nalong beside him.\r\n\r\nThe deck scorched his hands and face. He wriggled out and dragged\r\nhimself up to the chair, clinging tightly. 

But it was all over. He\r\nstood for a moment, waiting, then sat down.\r\n\r\nExperimentally he caressed his burned face. Looking out the windows\r\nhe tried to see some cause for the shock. Then he realized his moon\r\nwas gone. It had passed out of the deep shadow into the penumbra of\r\nthe ship and had been instantly vaporized. The shock had been its\r\ndissociated molecules pummeling the front of the ship.\r\n\r\nHe would have to be careful. If that could have passed directly into\r\nthe full light instead of through the half shadow of the penumbra,\r\nthe front of the ship might have caved in, softened as it was to near\r\nplasticity. Jim reached for the log again, but his hand stopped in\r\nmid air. With the spaceman\'s sensitivity to changes of state, he knew\r\nsomething was wrong. Something had changed in the shock of the moon\'s\r\nexplosion.\r\n\r\nHe puzzled it over, but his heat befuddled brain refused to grasp\r\nthings. He scanned all the instruments on the panel, but saw nothing\r\nunusual. At one side, he had a little tracer going, little drum turning\r\nwith a needle scribing a red line. On it he had set the increase in\r\nthe sun\'s pull against time to describe a curve. He examined this\r\ncurve. The red line had changed direction suddenly; the sun\'s pull was\r\nincreasing faster.\r\n\r\n"Dammit!" he said. 

The force of the explosion in front had slowed him\r\nand shorn off some protective centrifugal force. Now he picked up\r\npoints on the new curve, set down equations, and found he would die\r\nsome twenty hours sooner than he had expected.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHis mind began to revolt at the training that made him go on like this.\r\nThe turning of the ship now showed him only the face of the sun. He\r\nlooked at it a while, then shrugged his shoulders in disgust. 

Slowly he\r\ngot up and walked toward the gun cabinet. The little door swung open as\r\nhe pressed the button and he stared at the holstered weapon.\r\n\r\nLeaving the door open, he walked away, looking back toward it. He\r\nretrieved his cup and filled it with tepid water. Throwing his head\r\nback he drained it at a gulp; then refilled it. He walked to the engine\r\ncompartment door. It swung open at his touch, and he stepped into\r\nthe tiny gangway. Here a tiny porthole looked out into the infinite\r\nblue-black deeps of space. Jim leaned against a bulkhead and wiped\r\nsweat from his eyes.\r\n\r\nHe tried to think. Not of escape, but of the frigid emptiness of\r\nspace, the cool earth he had left behind. Into his mind came a\r\nfleeting glimpse of a lake back home on earth, a cold lake ringed with\r\nblue-green pines, jade waters where he had dived deep with the iciness\r\nstinging his skin. Against the metal bulkhead, his back began to burn.\r\nThe vision faded. He realized he was thirsty all over.\r\n\r\nHe gulped his cup of water and went back to the pilot\'s compartment.\r\nAt the open door of the gun cabinet, he stopped and sent his empty\r\ncup clattering against the sunward windows. He took the gun from the\r\ncabinet.\r\n\r\nBack to the pilot\'s chair again. He toyed with the gun. The ship had\r\nturned now so that the other vast heaving horizon cut across the view.\r\n"Oh, hell!" Jim said, and brought the gun\'s muzzle to his mouth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _"Oh, hell!" Jim said and brought the gun\'s muzzle to\r\nhis mouth._]\r\n\r\nThen he lowered it, sweat poured down into his eyes as his forehead\r\nwrinkled in dull puzzlement. He should be thinking about something,\r\nhe was forgetting something. Jim tried to cudgel his heat-beclouded\r\nbrain into some semblance of order.... Water, explosion, change of\r\nvelocity.... Where was the drain outlet for the water supply located?\r\n\r\nHe laid the gun aside and riffled through a drawer of blueprints, until\r\nhe found the piping layout. Now he explored the maze of piping along\r\nthe ship\'s sunward side. There it was, a little brass valve with a pipe\r\nleading to the outside skin.\r\n\r\nThe valve was hot enough to sear his hand. Jim carefully wrapped his\r\nhandkerchief around the handle and twisted gently. Inside pressure\r\nsquirted a thin stream of water from the supply tank into the hot\r\nvacuum of space. As it vaporized and dissociated into its atoms, Jim\r\nfelt a mighty surge of expansion against the ship. The blows of a soft\r\nfist pummeled the side.\r\n\r\nJim groaned as the softened plates of the hull creaked and buckled,\r\nbut he held the valve as it was. An inside panel split and let a thin\r\nsifting of insulation drift to the deck. His knee was against the deck\r\nplates and he became conscious of the burning through the cloth of his\r\nuniform. But he stayed there, until through the windows he saw nothing\r\nbut the speckled black of space turn slowly up. Then he shut the valve\r\noff and, rubbing his burned knee, anxiously hobbled to the tracer.\r\n\r\nThe red line had not so much swoop to it now. "Ya!" 

he shouted\r\nexultantly. The centrifugal force from his forward velocity needed just\r\na little help to begin pushing him away from the sun. Jim read the\r\nwater tank gauge; about twenty gallons left.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFidgeting, he waited another hour. The sun\'s horizon swung up into\r\nview, the blazing plain filled the windows and at last he saw again the\r\nother horizon. It would not do to twist the valve too soon; he had to\r\nwait until the outlet was directly toward the sun so he wouldn\'t lose\r\nany precious forward velocity.\r\n\r\nThe sun\'s horizon bisected the windows. Now! Encouraged by his other\r\nsuccess, Jim twisted the valve hard. He stepped back so his sore knee\r\nwould not rest against the plates.\r\n\r\nThe ship bounced like a beachball in the tremendous upshoot of the\r\ngases outside. Jim clung to a stanchion to keep from being knocked off\r\nhis feet.\r\n\r\nLike a rubber ball dimpled by a thumb, the ship\'s skin began to bulge\r\ninward. Jim tried to let go his hold to get the valve.\r\n\r\nThe bounce of the ship knocked him to his knees. A little steel desk\r\ncame sliding across the compartment, banging him on the shoulder. He\r\nlet go with one hand and shoved the desk between the bulging wall and\r\na cross bulkhead. A white line appeared across the desk, and the paint\r\ncrackled as it began to fold in the middle.\r\n\r\nJim let go and dived for the valve. A panel split wide and insulation\r\npoured out. A scream bubbled from his throat as radiation cut a line\r\nacross his face.\r\n\r\nHe rolled away, then struggled to get to the valve again. But the push\r\nstopped. The tank was empty.\r\n\r\nGroaning with the pain of his face, Jim went to his tracer. He forgot\r\nthe burn as he saw the curve now paralleled zero. No ... it went up a\r\nlittle. Jim whooped for joy.\r\n\r\nNow he scurried about the ship gathering together all the liquids he\r\ncould find. Soup, fruit juice, medicines. He piled them beside the\r\nwater tank and unscrewed the cap. Air whooshed in.\r\n\r\nAt the sound, Jim grinned. He left his pile of cans and bottles as they\r\nwere, and unscrewed the cap to a spare oxygen tank. The compartment\r\nair pressure went up to about twenty five pounds. The excess of oxygen\r\nexhilarated him.\r\n\r\nHe looked over his pile of cans and bottles. He didn\'t like consomme,\r\nit went into the tank. Chicken broth followed. Everything he didn\'t\r\nlike went into the tank, everything else stayed out. Then he patched\r\nthe rip in the panel.\r\n\r\nIt was time. Jim crouched carefully beside the valve, opening it\r\nslowly. The mess inside the tank squirted out. Again the surge beat\r\nagainst the ship, but with the first groan of the hull, Jim throttled\r\nthe valve down a little. His eyes were on the compartment pressure\r\ngauge. The consomme went and inside air began to hiss out. As it too\r\nexpanded, the push on the hull continued.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun\'s horizon was out of sight, the inside pressure registered\r\nonly twelve pounds. Jim shut the valve off.\r\n\r\nNow the tracer line was a nice curve upward.\r\n\r\nJim swung into the pilot\'s chair. He was a little oxygen drunk, but he\r\nmade calculations grow on the page until he had his result. Then he\r\nleaned back and gave the universe a beatific smile.\r\n\r\nHis spiral now outward, would stop as soon as his orbit expanded and\r\ncentrifugal force became less. As the forces came into balance, he\r\nwould take up a permanent orbit around the sun. 

But that orbit lay well\r\noutside the region of heavy static, and he could radio for help. In his\r\nmind he already heard the sweet clang of magnetic grapples against the\r\nhull.\r\n\r\nJim reached for the log and began to letter neatly at the top of a new\r\npage:\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIONS FOR SPACEMEN CAUGHT IN THE SUN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


"\r\n\r\n"Hardly," I said, rather flippantly. "Once the bug has bitten you--"\r\n\r\n"Have you had anything accepted?"\r\n\r\nI stared at the rug, hating the man for asking. "No, not yet," I\r\nadmitted grudgingly, "but--"\r\n\r\n"Then the bug hasn\'t _really_ bitten you yet," he said. "You\'ll know it\r\nwhen he does."\r\n\r\n"I--uh--guess my letter was a bit--er--abrupt," I said, not knowing how\r\nelse to fill the silence.\r\n\r\n"You were pretty mad," he admitted, "and I don\'t blame you; I should\r\nhave known better than to tell you that way. But in this game,\r\nyou\'ve--well, you\'ve got to learn to take criticism. If your work\'s\r\nbad, admit it and throw in the towel."\r\n\r\n"And mine\'s bad?"\r\n\r\nHe shrugged, avoiding my eyes. 

"I\'m afraid so."\r\n\r\nBut the steam had been released and the period of mourning had ended,\r\nso "I\'ll improve," I told him.\r\n\r\n"You\'re wasting your time."\r\n\r\n"Possibly. What I can\'t understand, though, is why a big name in\r\nscience-fiction comes way the devil out here just to advise me to stop\r\nknocking my head against a wall."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps more than your head is at stake," he said.\r\n\r\n"What?

"\r\n\r\n"Nothing," he said hastily. For a moment his pale face held a haunted\r\nlook, and he rose, looking like a man unsure of himself. "I can\'t talk\r\nyou out of it, so I\'d better go.

"\r\n\r\n"Wait a minute. 

Just what did you mean by that other remark?"\r\n\r\nDonald MacDonald glanced around him as though he were afraid invisible\r\nbeings might be eavesdropping. "You really want to know the reason why?"\r\n\r\nI nodded.\r\n\r\n"Your work is good," he said seriously. "Too good. Not up to par on\r\nsome points, but in a few years you\'ll be going places. That\'s why I\r\nsneaked away from them and came here--to beg you to reconsider, to stop\r\nthis writing now, before it\'s too late."\r\n\r\n"You mean--you _can\'t_ mean--you\'re not--afraid of competition?"\r\n\r\nHe waved an annoyed hand. "Competition, hell! There\'s always room for\r\nmore. You don\'t understand," he went on, screwing his face into a look\r\nof determination. "I\'m trying to save your peace of mind, your sanity\r\nperhaps. The mind is a great and powerful thing, sometimes dangerous.\r\nAll these things--these alien creatures that a science-fiction author\r\ncreates--"\r\n\r\n"Yes?"\r\n\r\nBut he had straightened suddenly, a look of terror on a face gone\r\nashen. 

He went to the door like a man being pushed, fumbled for the\r\nknob. "I beg of you, for your sake, forget it," he called back. Then he\r\nwas gone.\r\n\r\nI went out on the porch but MacDonald was not in sight. I heard a\r\nstrange noise as of the flapping of great leathery wings. A shadow\r\npassed across the lawn. I looked up.\r\n\r\nNothing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next morning I got a small envelope in the mail. The letter inside\r\nread, "Enclosed is a check for your story THE MONBEAST...." I sank into\r\nthe softest chair in the world and read those wonderful, wonderful\r\nwords, and held the check in my hand and read those wonderful,\r\nwonderful figures. I was so in a trance I hardly noticed the tiny\r\ndecimal point that scampered on tiny legs across the check. I hardly\r\nfelt the small, sharp bite--but....\r\n\r\nMy first acceptance! It was incredible the exhilaration that flowed\r\nthrough me in that instant. It was like a much-needed shot of\r\nadrenaline, like cool springwater to a thirsty man. I had a check for\r\na story someone thought enough of to publish. I was an author. 

A real,\r\nlive, honest-to-goodness author with a check in my hand to prove to a\r\ncritical world that I wasn\'t a bum after all. Suddenly the world was a\r\nbig, wide, wonderful place to live in, and I loved everyone in it--even\r\nthe poor, disillusioned Donald MacDonald.\r\n\r\nBut why stop here? I thought. 

There were more checks where that came\r\nfrom. If I could sell one story, I could sell two, and then three, and\r\nfour. So I did. In a way, it was something like digging my own grave.\r\nYou don\'t understand that now, but in a little while you\'ll see the\r\nreason why.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter I had haunted the newsstand for about three months, the great day\r\ncame. THE MONBEAST was the last story in the magazine (at the time I\r\nthought they really should have featured it) and my name was misspelled\r\non the contents page, but it was a great day just the same. A day of\r\ntriumph. A day for rejoicing. I\'d had several stories accepted during\r\nthe several months\' interval, but this was the day that the fruits of\r\nmy labor became evident to the world.\r\n\r\nI walked home with a proud, firm step, casually displaying the magazine\r\nto the vast public eye, to friend and foe alike. I tried to act\r\nnonchalant, as though this were old stuff to an established writer like\r\nme. It was a day of glory, of triumph, rivaling Caesar\'s victorious\r\nmarch into Rome.\r\n\r\nThat evening I read the story over and over again, marveling at the\r\nperfection of its form, savoring the exquisite flavor of each delicate,\r\nrichly-hued, word, the uniqueness of each choice, well-turned phrase. I\r\nfell asleep with the magazine in my hand.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next morning the monbeast was sitting at the foot of my bed.\r\n\r\n"Okay, okay," it said, blinking its bug-eyes at me, "don\'t act so\r\nsurprised. MacDonald warned you, didn\'t he?"\r\n\r\n"But--but--"\r\n\r\n"Sure, I\'m real," the monbeast volunteered, scratching its scaly head\r\nwith a long-nailed finger. "That\'s the trouble with you guys. You\'re\r\nfull of imagination, but you can\'t face reality."\r\n\r\n"Where--where\'d you come from?"\r\n\r\nThe monbeast shrugged massive green shoulders. "The whole thing\'s much\r\ntoo technical for me to worry about. All I know is us BEMs exist, and\r\nwe get to your dimension via science-fiction."\r\n\r\n"That \'power of mind\' MacDonald was talking about?" I said, shuddering\r\na bit.\r\n\r\n"Something like that. Other forms of fiction deal with things native to\r\nyour world. Science-fiction regards us BEMs as real, so while we don\'t\r\nordinarily exist here, there\'s a stress created in the barrier between\r\nus, and we come through."\r\n\r\n"Then you\'re really real?"\r\n\r\n"Practically. Right now, though, you\'re the only one who can see and\r\nhear me. You haven\'t characterized me sufficiently so that the readers\r\nwill be convinced that I\'m real. But that\'s okay. 

You\'ll improve."\r\n\r\n"Thanks. But now what about you?" 

I said, trying to not appear\r\noveranxious. "Are you returning to your own dimension or are you\r\nstaying here for awhile?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe monbeast grinned, showing the eighty sharp-pointed teeth I knew it\r\npossessed. "Sorry, I\'m here to stay. I\'m your brainchild, you know, so\r\nI\'ll have to stick to you."\r\n\r\nI gulped. "Stick to me?"\r\n\r\n"Only figuratively," the monbeast said. "But I\'ll be around." He\r\ncocked a bug-eye at me and said gravely, "We\'d better get a few things\r\nstraight right from the start. One of them is that as far as you\'re\r\nconcerned, I\'m as real as that bedpost."\r\n\r\n"Real?" I tried to laugh that off, but the sound came out a little\r\nweakly. "That\'s silly. You\'re just a product of my imagination."\r\n\r\n"Am I?" the monbeast said.\r\n\r\nHe thrust the scaly face close to mine and yawned. Suddenly the room\r\nbecame a turkish bath.\r\n\r\n"Okay, okay," I said hastily, "turn it off."\r\n\r\nCoolness came, and I breathed easier as the steam dissipated.\r\n\r\n"Secondly, you\'re going to create bigger and better BEMs and make them\r\nmore convincing," the monbeast continued. "With all you writers turning\r\nus loose, we can have a swell time in this world.

"\r\n\r\n"But how can you?" I protested. "You said the readers wouldn\'t believe\r\nin you, so you don\'t exist for them."\r\n\r\n"Science-fiction is growing," the monbeast said. "Everyday more people\r\nare getting to realize that there is more to the world than those\r\nthings they see around them. They believe what they read in love\r\nstories and detective stories. Science-fiction is next."\r\n\r\n"Suppose I don\'t want to create more BEMs?" I said. "Suppose I take up\r\nsaxophone playing or something and leave science-fiction alone."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t stop writing it now, any more than a true fan can stop\r\nreading it. The bug has bitten you." He smiled a piano keyboard of\r\nteeth and continued, "Besides, I could be obliged to--er--inspire you\r\njust a bit. But you just work along with me, and we\'ll both do fine."\r\n\r\nSo we did.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe monbeast isn\'t such a bad fellow after all, once you get to know\r\nhim. Neither are the other BEMs hanging around my house. 

Oh, yes, there\r\nare others, lots of them. Hanging from the rafters. Under chairs. In\r\ncoffee cups. Everywhere. It\'s an occupational hazard, you know.\r\n\r\nChances are, though, you wouldn\'t be able to see them--unless you\'re a\r\nreal gone science-fiction fan, and even then maybe not. But someday you\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nSomeday you\'ll be sitting in your favorite chair reading your favorite\r\nscience-fiction magazine, and you\'ll look up....\r\n\r\nMaybe it\'ll be sitting on the desk beside you, running one of four\r\nhands through a nest of snakes on its scaly head. Maybe it\'ll be only\r\nan inch tall and perched on the piano watching you. Maybe at first\r\nit\'ll be just a warm, dank breath on the back of your neck.\r\n\r\nNo telling _when_ it\'ll be either. Maybe next year, next month;\r\ntomorrow. 

Who knows--perhaps even now.\r\n\r\nHere\'s a little tip. When you lay down this magazine, turn around\r\nslowly. Have you ever had the feeling that something was going on\r\nbehind your back but when you turned around you saw nothing? What\'s\r\nthat? You think maybe you\'ve got that feeling right now?\r\n\r\nListen, on second thought, now that you know, maybe you better not turn\r\naround. Take this as a gag. 

A nice big laugh. You\'ll be a lot better\r\noff that way.\r\n\r\nWhat you don\'t know can\'t hurt you....\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


I\r\nasked him. Rusty and Doc laughed. It was a good joke because we rode out\r\nto the job in my jeep, and so we\'d naturally get there at the same time.\r\n\r\nThen Rusty sat up straighter and looked over at the bar. "Hey," he said,\r\n"Pop\'s talking to Burt Holden." Pop Johnson owns our outfit. He\'s one of\r\nthe small operators that guys like Burt are trying to squeeze out.\r\n\r\n"Hope he don\'t try to rook Pop into no deals," said Lew.\r\n\r\nDoc tipped up his bottle of beer. In Oregon they don\'t sell anything but\r\nbeer in the taverns. 

"Times change," he said. "Back in 1900 all they\r\nwanted was gold. Now they\'re trying to take all the trees."\r\n\r\n"It\'s the big operators like Burt," I said. "Little guys like Pop can\'t\r\ncut \'em as fast as they grow. The companies don\'t have to reseed,\r\neither, except on National Forest land."\r\n\r\n"That Burt Holden was up to my place couple weeks ago," said Doc. "Darn\r\nnear caught me skinning out a deer."\r\n\r\n"He better not yap to the game warden," said Rusty. "Them laws is for\r\nsports and Outsiders, not us guys who need the meat."\r\n\r\n"He wanted to buy all my timber," said Doc. "Offered me ten dollars a\r\nthousand board feet, on the stump."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t sell," I advised him. "If Burt offers that much, almost anyone\r\nelse will pay twelve."\r\n\r\nDoc looked at me. "I\'d never sell my trees. Not at any price. I got a\r\nhundred and sixty acres of virgin stand, and that\'s the way it\'s gonna\r\nstay. I cut up the windfalls and snags for firewood, and that\'s all."\r\n\r\n"Here comes Pop," said Lew.\r\n\r\nPop sat down with us and had a beer. He looked worried. 

We didn\'t ask\r\nhim any questions, because we figure a man will talk if he wants to, and\r\nif he doesn\'t it\'s his own business.\r\n\r\nHe finally unlimbered. "Burt Holden wants to buy the mill," he said,\r\nwiping his mouth on the back of his hand.\r\n\r\n"Buy _your_ mill?" said Lew. "Hell, his mill is five times as big, and\r\nhe\'s even got a burner to take care of slashings, so he don\'t have to\r\nshut down in the fire season."\r\n\r\n"He just wants the land," said Pop, "because it\'s near the highway. He\r\nwants to tear down my setup and build a pulp mill."\r\n\r\n"A _pulp_ mill!" If we could have seen Doc\'s eyes through the glasses I\r\nimagine they\'d have been popped open a full half inch. "Why, then\r\nthey\'ll be cutting down everything but the brush!"\r\n\r\nPop nodded. 

"Yeah. Size of a log don\'t matter when you make paper--just\r\nso it\'s wood."\r\n\r\nIt seemed as though Doc was talking to himself. 

"They\'ll strip the land\r\ndown bare," he mumbled. "And the hills will wash away, and the chemicals\r\nthey use in the mill will kill the fish in the creeks and the Illinois\r\nRiver."\r\n\r\n"That\'s why they won\'t let anyone start a pulp mill near Grants Pass,"\r\nsaid Pop. "Most of the town\'s money comes from sports who come up to the\r\nRogue River to fish."\r\n\r\nRusty set his jaw. "In the winter we _need_ them fish," he said. He was\r\nright, too. The woods close down in the winter, on account of the snow,\r\nand if a man can\'t hunt and fish he\'s liable to get kind of hungry. That\r\nrocking chair money doesn\'t stretch very far.\r\n\r\n"I ain\'t gonna sell," said Pop. "But that won\'t stop Burt Holden, and\r\nany place he builds the mill around here will drain into the Illinois."\r\n\r\nDoc pushed back his chair and stood up to his full height of five foot\r\nfour. "I\'m gonna talk to Burt Holden," he said.\r\n\r\nRusty stood up to his six foot three. "I\'ll bring him over here, Doc,"\r\nhe said. "We\'re handy to the cue rack here, and Lew and Simmons can keep\r\nthem guys he\'s with off my back."\r\n\r\nI stood up and shoved Rusty back down. I\'m no taller than he is, but I\r\noutweigh him about twenty pounds. I started working in the woods when we\r\nstill felled trees with axes and misery whips--crosscut saws to the\r\nOutsiders. "I\'ll go get him," I said. "You\'re still mad about the show,\r\nand you wouldn\'t be able to get him this far without mussing him up."\r\n\r\n"There won\'t be no trouble," said Doc. "I just want to make him an\r\noffer."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI went over and told Burt that Doc wanted to talk to him. The three guys\r\nwith him followed us back to the table.\r\n\r\nBurt figured he knew what it was all about, and he just stood over Doc\r\nand looked down on him. "If it\'s about your timber, Yoris," he said,\r\n"I\'ll take it, but I can\'t pay you more than nine dollars now. Lumber\'s\r\ncoming down, and I\'m taking a chance even at that." He rocked back and\r\nforth on his heels and looked at Pop as though daring him to say\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\n"I still don\'t want to sell, Mr. Holden," said Doc. "But I\'ve got better\r\nthan three million feet on my place, and I\'ll _give_ it to you if you\r\nwon\'t put a pulp mill anywhere in the Illinois Valley."\r\n\r\nWe were all floored at that, but Burt recovered first. He gave a nasty\r\nlaugh. 

"Not interested, Yoris. If you want to sell, look me up."\r\n\r\n"Wait!" 

said Doc. "A pulp mill will take every tree in the Valley. In a\r\nfew years--"\r\n\r\n"It\'ll make money, too," said Burt flatly.\r\n\r\n"Money ain\'t everything by a long shot. It won\'t buy trees and creeks\r\nand rain."\r\n\r\n"It\'ll buy trees to make lumber." Burt was getting mad. "I don\'t want\r\nany opposition from you, Yoris. I\'ve had enough trouble from people who\r\ntry to hold back progress. If you don\'t like the way we run things here,\r\nyou can--hell, you can go back to Mars!

"\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that it was just about time to start in. I could have\r\ntaken Burt easiest, but I knew Rusty would probably swing on him first\r\nand get in my way, so I planned to work on the two guys on Burt\'s right,\r\nleaving the one on his left for Lew. I didn\'t want Pop to get tangled up\r\nin it.\r\n\r\nI don\'t generally wait too long after I make up my mind, but then I\r\nnoticed Rusty reaching out slowly for a cue stick, and I thought maybe\r\nI\'d better take Burt first, while Rusty got set. I never did see a guy\r\nso one way about having something in his hands.\r\n\r\nBut Doc didn\'t drop out. "There ain\'t nothing but a few scrub trees on\r\nMars," he said to Burt, looking him square in the eye. "And no creeks\r\nand no rain."\r\n\r\nBurt curled his lip sarcastically. 

"The hell you say! 

Is that why you\r\ndidn\'t like it there?" You could see he was just trying to egg Doc into\r\nsaying he\'d come from Mars, so he could give him the horse laugh. The\r\nguys he was with were getting set for a fracas, but they were waiting\r\nfor Burt to lead off.\r\n\r\nDoc didn\'t get caught. "But there\'s gold," he said, like he hadn\'t heard\r\nBurt at all. "Tons of it--laying all over the ground."\r\n\r\nI guess Burt decided to ride along. "Okay, Yoris," he said. 

"Tell you\r\nwhat I\'ll do. For only one ton of Martian gold I\'ll agree to drop all\r\nplans for a pulp mill, here or anywhere else. In fact, I\'ll get out of\r\nbusiness altogether."\r\n\r\nDoc moved in like a log falling out of the loading tongs. "That\'s a\r\ndeal," he said. "You ready to go?"\r\n\r\nBurt started to look disgusted, then he smiled. 

"Sure. Mars must be\r\nquite a place if you came from there."\r\n\r\n"Okay," said Doc. "You just stand up against the wall, Mr. Holden."\r\nBurt\'s smile faded. He figured Doc was trying to maneuver him into a\r\nlikely position for us. But Doc cleared that up quick. "You boys get up\r\nand stand aside," he ordered. "Get back a ways and give Mr. Holden\r\nplenty of room." We didn\'t like it, but we cleared out from around the\r\ntable. A bunch from the bar and pool tables, sensing something was up,\r\ncame drifting over to watch. I could feel tension building up. "Now,"\r\nsaid Doc, pointing, "you just stand right over there, Mr. Holden, and\r\nfold your arms."\r\n\r\nBurt didn\'t like the audience, and I guess he figured his plans were\r\nbackfiring when Doc didn\'t bluff. "You hill-happy old coot," he\r\nsnarled. "You\'d better go home and sleep it off!" I grabbed hold of\r\nLew\'s arm and shook my head at Rusty. I wasn\'t going to interfere with\r\nDoc now.\r\n\r\n"You\'re not scared, are you, Mr. Holden?" said Doc quietly. "Just you\r\nstand against the wall and take it easy. It won\'t hurt a bit."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBurt Holden was plenty tough for an Outsider, and a hard-headed\r\nbusinessman to boot, but he\'d never run into a customer like Doc before.\r\nYou could see him trying to make up his mind on how to handle this\r\nthing. He glanced around quick at the crowd, and I could tell he decided\r\nto play it out to where Doc would have to draw in his horns. He actually\r\ngrinned, for the effect it would have on everybody watching. 

"All right,\r\nYoris," he said. He backed against the wall and folded his arms. "But\r\nhadn\'t you better stand up here with me?"\r\n\r\n"I ain\'t going," said Doc. "I don\'t like Mars. But you won\'t have no\r\ntrouble getting your gold. There\'s nuggets the size of your fist laying\r\nall over the dry river beds."\r\n\r\n"I hate to be nosey," said Burt, playing to the crowd, "but how are you\r\ngoing to get me there?"\r\n\r\n"With his head, o\'course!" 

blurted Rusty before I could stop him. "Just\r\nlike he cures you when you\'re sick!" Doc had pulled Rusty through two or\r\nthree bad kid sicknesses--and a lot of the rest of us, too.\r\n\r\n"Yep," said Doc. "A man don\'t need one of them rocket things to get\r\nbetween here and Mars. Fact is, I never seen one."\r\n\r\nBurt looked at the ceiling like he was a martyr, then back at Doc.\r\n"Well, Yoris," he said in a tone that meant he was just about through\r\nhumoring him, "I\'m waiting. Can you send me there or can\'t you?" The\r\nstart of a nasty smile was beginning to show at the corners of his\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n"Sure," said Doc. He slumped down in his chair and cupped his hands\r\nlightly around his dark glasses. I noticed his fingers trembling a\r\nlittle against his forehead.\r\n\r\nThe lights dimmed, flickered and went out, and we waited for the\r\nbartender to put in a new fuse. The power around here doesn\'t go haywire\r\nexcept in the winter, when trees fall across the lines. A small fight\r\nstarted over in a corner.\r\n\r\nWhen the lights came back on, Doc and Pop started for the door, and Lew\r\nand Rusty and I followed. Burt\'s buddies were looking kind of puzzled,\r\nand a few old-timers were moving over to watch the fight. The rest were\r\nheading back to the bar.\r\n\r\nRusty piled into the jeep with Doc and me. "When you going to bring him\r\nback, Doc?" he asked when we started moving.\r\n\r\n"Dunno," said Doc. He took off his glasses to watch me shift gears. He\'s\r\nbeen after me for a long time to teach him how to drive. "It only works\r\non a man once."\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _If Worlds of Science Fiction_ November\r\n    1953.

Talking\r\nto Barbara, your fianc\xc3\xa9e. Looking at Barbara--Barbara in a swim\r\nsuit--her skin golden tan in the brilliant sunshine, beautiful.\r\n\r\nYou wore swimming trunks. Now you do not feel them on you; the slight\r\npressure of the elastic waistband is no longer there against your waist.\r\nYou touch your hands to your hips. 

You are naked. And standing.\r\n\r\nWhatever has happened to you is more than a change to sudden darkness or\r\nto sudden blindness.\r\n\r\nYou raise your hands gropingly before you. They touch a plain smooth\r\nsurface, a wall. You spread them apart and each hand reaches a corner.\r\nYou pivot slowly. A second wall, then a third, then a door. You are in a\r\ncloset about four feet square.\r\n\r\nYour hand finds the knob of the door. It turns and you push the door\r\nopen.\r\n\r\nThere is light now. The door has opened to a lighted room ... a room\r\nthat you have never seen before.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is not large, but it is pleasantly furnished--although the furniture\r\nis of a style that is strange to you. Modesty makes you open the door\r\ncautiously the rest of the way. But the room is empty of people.\r\n\r\nYou step into the room, turning to look behind you into the closet,\r\nwhich is now illuminated by light from the room. The closet is and is\r\nnot a closet; it is the size and shape of one, but it contains nothing,\r\nnot a single hook, no rod for hanging clothes, no shelf. It is an empty,\r\nblank-walled, four-by-four-foot space.\r\n\r\nYou close the door to it and stand looking around the room. It is about\r\ntwelve by sixteen feet. There is one door, but it is closed. There are\r\nno windows. Five pieces of furniture. Four of them you recognize--more\r\nor less. One looks like a very functional desk. One is obviously a\r\nchair ... a comfortable-looking one. There is a table, although its top\r\nis on several levels instead of only one. Another is a bed, or couch.\r\nSomething shimmering is lying across it and you walk over and pick the\r\nshimmering something up and examine it. It is a garment.\r\n\r\nYou are naked, so you put it on. Slippers are part way under the bed (or\r\ncouch) and you slide your feet into them. They fit, and they feel warm\r\nand comfortable as nothing you have ever worn on your feet has felt.\r\nLike lamb\'s wool, but softer.\r\n\r\nYou are dressed now. You look at the door--the only door of the room\r\nexcept that of the closet (closet?) 

from which you entered it. You walk\r\nto the door and before you try the knob, you see the small typewritten\r\nsign pasted just above it that reads:\r\n\r\n    This door has a time lock set to open in one hour. For reasons you\r\n    will soon understand, it is better that you do not leave this room\r\n    before then. There is a letter for you on the desk. Please read it.\r\n\r\nIt is not signed. You look at the desk and see that there is an envelope\r\nlying on it.\r\n\r\nYou do not yet go to take that envelope from the desk and read the\r\nletter that must be in it.\r\n\r\nWhy not? Because you are frightened.\r\n\r\nYou see other things about the room. The lighting has no source that you\r\ncan discover. It comes from nowhere. It is not indirect lighting; the\r\nceiling and the walls are not reflecting it at all.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Illustrated by VIDMER]\r\n\r\nThey didn\'t have lighting like that, back where you came from. What did\r\nyou mean by _back where you came from_?\r\n\r\nYou close your eyes. You tell yourself: _I am Norman Hastings. I am an\r\nassociate professor of mathematics at the University of Southern\r\nCalifornia. I am twenty-five years old, and this is the year nineteen\r\nhundred and fifty-four._\r\n\r\nYou open your eyes and look again.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey didn\'t use that style of furniture in Los Angeles--or anywhere else\r\nthat you know of--in 1954. That thing over in the corner--you can\'t even\r\nguess what it is. So might your grandfather, at your age, have looked at\r\na television set.\r\n\r\nYou look down at yourself, at the shimmering garment that you found\r\nwaiting for you. With thumb and forefinger you feel its texture.\r\n\r\nIt\'s like nothing you\'ve ever touched before.\r\n\r\n_I am Norman Hastings. This is nineteen hundred and fifty-four._\r\n\r\nSuddenly you must know, and at once.\r\n\r\nYou go to the desk and pick up the envelope that lies upon it. Your name\r\nis typed on the outside: _Norman Hastings_.\r\n\r\nYour hands shake a little as you open it. Do you blame them?\r\n\r\nThere are several pages, typewritten. Dear Norman, it starts. You turn\r\nquickly to the end to look for the signature. It is unsigned.\r\n\r\nYou turn back and start reading.\r\n\r\n"Do not be afraid. There is nothing to fear, but much to explain. Much\r\nthat you must understand before the time lock opens that door. Much that\r\nyou must accept and--obey.\r\n\r\n"You have already guessed that you are in the future--in what, to you,\r\nseems to be the future. The clothes and the room must have told you\r\nthat. I planned it that way so the shock would not be too sudden, so you\r\nwould realize it over the course of several minutes rather than read it\r\nhere--and quite probably disbelieve what you read.\r\n\r\n"The \'closet\' from which you have just stepped is, as you have by now\r\nrealized, a time machine. From it you stepped into the world of 2004.\r\nThe date is April 7th, just fifty years from the time you last remember.\r\n\r\n"You cannot return.\r\n\r\n"I did this to you and you may hate me for it; I do not know. That is up\r\nto you to decide, but it does not matter. 

What does matter, and not to\r\nyou alone, is another decision which you must make. I am incapable of\r\nmaking it.\r\n\r\n"Who is writing this to you? 

I would rather not tell you just yet. By\r\nthe time you have finished reading this, even though it is not signed\r\n(for I knew you would look first for a signature), I will not need to\r\ntell you who I am. You will know.\r\n\r\n"I am seventy-five years of age. I have, in this year 2004, been\r\nstudying \'time\' for thirty of those years. I have completed the first\r\ntime machine ever built--and thus far, its construction, even the fact\r\nthat it has been constructed, is my own secret.\r\n\r\n"You have just participated in the first major experiment. It will be\r\nyour responsibility to decide whether there shall ever be any more\r\nexperiments with it, whether it should be given to the world, or whether\r\nit should be destroyed and never used again."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEnd of the first page. 

You look up for a moment, hesitating to turn the\r\nnext page. Already you suspect what is coming.\r\n\r\nYou turn the page.\r\n\r\n"I constructed the first time machine a week ago. My calculations had\r\ntold me that it would work, but not how it would work. I had expected it\r\nto send an object back in time--it works backward in time only, not\r\nforward--physically unchanged and intact.\r\n\r\n"My first experiment showed me my error. I placed a cube of metal in the\r\nmachine--it was a miniature of the one you just walked out of--and set\r\nthe machine to go backward ten years. I flicked the switch and opened\r\nthe door, expecting to find the cube vanished. Instead I found it had\r\ncrumbled to powder.\r\n\r\n"I put in another cube and sent it two years back. The second cube came\r\nback unchanged, except that it was newer, shinier.\r\n\r\n"That gave me the answer. I had been expecting the cubes to go back in\r\ntime, and they had done so, but not in the sense I had expected them to.\r\nThose metal cubes had been fabricated about three years previously. I\r\nhad sent the first one back years before it had existed in its\r\nfabricated form. Ten years ago it had been ore. The machine returned it\r\nto that state.\r\n\r\n"Do you see how our previous theories of time travel have been wrong? We\r\nexpected to be able to step into a time machine in, say, 2004, set it\r\nfor fifty years back, and then step out in the year 1954 ... but it does\r\nnot work that way. The machine does not move in time. Only whatever is\r\nwithin the machine is affected, and then just with relation to itself\r\nand not to the rest of the Universe.\r\n\r\n"I confirmed this with guinea pigs by sending one six weeks old five\r\nweeks back and it came out a baby.\r\n\r\n"I need not outline all my experiments here. You will find a record of\r\nthem in the desk and you can study it later.\r\n\r\n"Do you understand now what has happened to you, Norman?

"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYou begin to understand. And you begin to sweat.\r\n\r\nThe _I_ who wrote that letter you are now reading is _you_, yourself at\r\nthe age of seventy-five, in this year of 2004. You are that\r\nseventy-five-year-old man, with your body returned to what it had been\r\nfifty years ago, with all the memories of fifty years of living wiped\r\nout.\r\n\r\n_You_ invented the time machine.\r\n\r\nAnd before you used it on yourself, you made these arrangements to help\r\nyou orient yourself. You wrote yourself the letter which you are now\r\nreading.\r\n\r\nBut if those fifty years are--to you--gone, what of all your friends,\r\nthose you loved? What of your parents? What of the girl you are\r\ngoing--were going--to marry?\r\n\r\nYou read on:\r\n\r\n"Yes, you will want to know what has happened. Mom died in 1963, Dad in\r\n1968. You married Barbara in 1956. I am sorry to tell you that she died\r\nonly three years later, in a plane crash. You have one son. He is still\r\nliving; his name is Walter; he is now forty-six years old and is an\r\naccountant in Kansas City."\r\n\r\nTears come into your eyes and for a moment you can no longer read.\r\nBarbara dead--dead for forty-five years. And only minutes ago, in\r\nsubjective time, you were sitting next to her, sitting in the bright sun\r\nin a Beverly Hills patio ...\r\n\r\nYou force yourself to read again.\r\n\r\n"But back to the discovery. You begin to see some of its implications.\r\nYou will need time to think to see all of them.\r\n\r\n"It does not permit time travel as we have thought of time travel, but\r\nit gives us immortality of a sort. Immortality of the kind I have\r\ntemporarily given us.\r\n\r\n"_Is it good?_ Is it worth while to lose the memory of fifty years of\r\none\'s life in order to return one\'s body to relative youth? The only way\r\nI can find out is to try, as soon as I have finished writing this and\r\nmade my other preparations.\r\n\r\n"You will know the answer.\r\n\r\n"But before you decide, remember that there is another problem, more\r\nimportant than the psychological one. I mean overpopulation.\r\n\r\n"If our discovery is given to the world, if all who are old or dying\r\ncan make themselves young again, the population will almost double every\r\ngeneration. Nor would the world--not even our own relatively enlightened\r\ncountry--be willing to accept compulsory birth control as a solution.\r\n\r\n"Give this to the world, as the world is today in 2004, and within a\r\ngeneration there will be famine, suffering, war. Perhaps a complete\r\ncollapse of civilization.\r\n\r\n"Yes, we have reached other planets, but they are not suitable for\r\ncolonizing. The stars may be our answer, but we are a long way from\r\nreaching them. When we do, someday, the billions of habitable planets\r\nthat must be out there will be our answer ... our living room. But until\r\nthen, what is the answer?\r\n\r\n"Destroy the machine? But think of the countless lives it can save, the\r\nsuffering it can prevent. Think of what it would mean to a man dying of\r\ncancer. 

Think ..."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThink. You finish the letter and put it down.\r\n\r\nYou think of Barbara dead for forty-five years. And of the fact that you\r\nwere married to her for three years and that those years are lost to\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nFifty years lost. You damn the old man of seventy-five whom you became\r\nand who has done this to you ... who has given you this decision to\r\nmake.\r\n\r\nBitterly, you know what the decision must be. You think that _he_ knew,\r\ntoo, and realize that he could safely leave it in your hands. Damn him,\r\nhe _should_ have known.\r\n\r\nToo valuable to destroy, too dangerous to give.\r\n\r\nThe other answer is painfully obvious.\r\n\r\nYou must be custodian of this discovery and keep it secret until it is\r\nsafe to give, until mankind has expanded to the stars and has new worlds\r\nto populate, or until, even without that, he has reached a state of\r\ncivilization where he can avoid overpopulation by rationing births to\r\nthe number of accidental--or voluntary--deaths.\r\n\r\nIf neither of those things has happened in another fifty years (and are\r\nthey likely so soon?), then you, at seventy-five, will be writing\r\nanother letter like this one. 

You will be undergoing another experience\r\nsimilar to the one you\'re going through now. 

And making the same\r\ndecision, of course.\r\n\r\nWhy not? You\'ll be the same person again.\r\n\r\nTime and again, to preserve this secret until Man is ready for it.\r\n\r\nHow often will you again sit at a desk like this one, thinking the\r\nthoughts you are thinking now, feeling the grief you now feel?\r\n\r\nThere is a click at the door and you know that the time lock has opened,\r\nthat you are now free to leave this room, free to start a new life for\r\nyourself in place of the one you have already lived and lost.\r\n\r\nBut you are in no hurry now to walk directly through that door.\r\n\r\nYou sit there, staring straight ahead of you blindly, seeing in your\r\nmind\'s eye the vista of a set of facing mirrors, like those in an\r\nold-fashioned barber shop, reflecting the same thing over and over\r\nagain, diminishing into far distance.\r\n\r\n                                                       --FREDRIC BROWN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Galaxy Science Fiction_ December 1953.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

"Dr. Seaward, will\r\nyou please take the observer\'s place and check."\r\n\r\nSeaward dropped the calculations in hand, walked across the control\r\nroom of the great interstellar explorer, up to the very tip. Kendall\r\nstood aside while the doctor applied his eye to the lens.\r\n\r\n"It\'s there all right, Broster. A little red disk exactly where he\r\ncalled it off; the chart\'s wrong."\r\n\r\nBroster ran a hand through his chestnut hair, a puzzled look in his\r\neyes. He glared at the space-chart for a moment, as if loath to believe\r\nthat that faithful instrument could have gone haywire. Then he picked\r\nhis way over to the electro-telescope to verify the sighting personally.\r\n\r\nA moment later, the three were looking at each other wonderingly.\r\nAll realized what this might mean: if that space-chart failed them,\r\nit might be all over with any possibility ever of returning home.\r\nSpace-navigating in the bounds of the solar system was one thing; there\r\nit didn\'t matter whether you ran by chart or by observation. But here\r\nin the bounds of cosmic space, thousands of light-years from the sun,\r\nwhere they had to navigate in the blackness of interstellar distances,\r\nthe space-chart was all-important. Bodies out here were dark; there\r\nwere no stars nearby from which they could reflect light....\r\n\r\n"That chart will have to be overhauled," murmured the captain. "If it\'s\r\ngone wrong...."\r\n\r\n"What about this planet? It\'s the only one around this star," put in\r\nKendall, jerking a thumb in its general direction.\r\n\r\n"Head toward it; we may as well give it the once-over."\r\n\r\nThe huge ship pursued its unvarying course toward the approaching star.\r\nAt a single light-year away, they decelerated, slowed down. Riding the\r\nstrange eka-gravity waves, the little-known carrier-waves for light and\r\ngravity which seemed to travel as fast in relation to light as light\r\nin relation to sound, this craft of the Thirtieth Century was able to\r\naccomplish what had for centuries been believed unachievable.\r\n\r\nThey approached until at last the gravital drag clutched the ship,\r\nstarted to draw it in toward that vast, fiery globe spurting forth\r\ncountless tons of disintegrated matter per second, emanating energy\r\ninconceivable. Yet, withal, a small star, smaller than Sol and quite\r\ninconspicuous as stars go.\r\n\r\nAs they drifted, Broster and Seaward examined the space-chart\r\nthoroughly. But in vain; nothing could be found out of order: no\r\nshort circuits, no tubes needing replacement. It was in perfect shape,\r\nbut ... it refused to light a white speck in its black field for the\r\nnear planet.\r\n\r\nThey watched the planet grow larger, slowly made out surface details.\r\nA ruddy world, bathed entirely in red light, although the star around\r\nwhich it circled was white. Crimson clouds floated in masses of carmine\r\nseas and necine land-masses. The glow of the red world shone in\r\nthrough the stella-quartzite ports, throwing a weird, bloody glare on\r\neverything.\r\n\r\n"This is a helluva world," growled Kendall. "You\'d go nuts there after\r\nawhile.

"\r\n\r\nSeaward nodded. 

"Quite so. Red is a color that acts to irritate those\r\nwho look at it overlong. I wouldn\'t advise staying on this world for\r\nmore than a few minutes. We could easily go mad were we forced to\r\nremain here so much as a day.

"\r\n\r\n"We\'ll land, anyway, and look around. If--" Broster was cut off\r\nabruptly as the shrill scream of the alarm pierced his line of thought.\r\n"What the devil is that?"\r\n\r\nThe sound of running feet from the far back of the ship came to their\r\nears, then the fourth member of the crew streaked into the control\r\nroom. "Space-ships approaching us!" Arundell shouted. "Didn\'t you spot\r\nthem?"\r\n\r\nBroster wheeled around to the chart. Nothing indicated; according to\r\nit, there was no planet ahead of them, no space-ships behind them. He\r\nmuttered something then hurried across to the side ports, swung out the\r\nperiscopic plates, stared anxiously to their rear.\r\n\r\nThere were at least a dozen of the red bodies moving along in their\r\nwake. Large, all of them, and near. Ships almost as great as the\r\n_Astralite_, ships that looked dangerous.\r\n\r\n"They\'re close," he grated, "too damn close. I don\'t like it."\r\n\r\n"Neither did I. I was wondering why you didn\'t do something when I saw\r\nthem in the port," Arundell exclaimed.\r\n\r\nBroster jumped to the controls, pulled the lever that should shunt\r\nthe ship to one side. But as the nose turned away, and the great mass\r\nof her began slowly to describe a long arc in relation to her former\r\ncourse, another exclamation came from Kendall: "They\'re spreading out\r\nto stop us!"\r\n\r\nBroster cursed, reset the course. The planet was dead ahead now.\r\n\r\n"Trapped!" he fumed. "The red planet ahead of us, and those ships\r\nbehind us. What do they want?"\r\n\r\n"It might be well to stop," Dr. Seaward put in. "They may want to look\r\nus over and nothing more. Unless we arouse suspicion by resisting now."\r\n\r\n"And they might steal the ship under our noses, too," protested\r\nArundell.\r\n\r\nBroster shook his head. "There cannot be a question of letting unknown\r\nintelligences enter this craft or hold it. We can\'t afford to take\r\nchances, even if the notion that other world dwellers are necessarily\r\nenemies is silly. We\'ve got to assume that everything we see is\r\ndangerous until proven harmless or friendly. Those are our first\r\norders: do not surrender the ship."\r\n\r\n"Then we run for it?" asked Seaward.\r\n\r\n"We do. Our offensive weapons may be better than theirs but it\'s\r\nanother chance we\'re not taking. The very fact that we\'re outnumbered\r\nmakes retreat the order of the day."\r\n\r\n"Look there!" 

exclaimed Arundell. "They\'re beaming past us!"\r\n\r\nOne of the strange oval, multi-ported, oddly-ornamented, crimson craft\r\nhad just shot a red beam alongside of the _Astralite_. Not touching it,\r\nbut passing by, as if to show that, whenever they cared, this fleet\r\ncould annihilate the intruder. Then, all the other ships surrounding\r\nthem began to flash beams. Crossing and criss-crossing all about them\r\nsave in front.\r\n\r\n"Look," exclaimed Kendall. "You can see those beams as if they were in\r\nair."\r\n\r\n"Marvellous and impossible," groaned Seaward. "We\'ve run into a\r\nswarm of impossibilities today. Some philosopher once remarked that\r\nin eternity everything was possible--in fact, everything that could\r\npossibly happen has happened. It looks as if we\'re running into bits of\r\nthat now. 

I should have taken my daughter\'s advice and let a younger\r\nman come this trip."\r\n\r\n"It may be impossible, but it\'s so," broke in Broster. 

"And deadly.\r\nWe\'re getting out of here fast."\r\n\r\nHe turned to the controls and a moment later the _Astralite_ began to\r\naccelerate. There was a limit to the speed they could reach as they\r\nwould have to shunt again soon to keep from smashing against the red\r\nplanet. Unless--\r\n\r\n"Why not?" asked Arundell, following Broster\'s evident thoughts.\r\n\r\n"They apparently want us to land on the planet. So we do go for it,\r\nthen shunt aside at the last minute."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt first, it seemed as if the _Astralite_ would leave the others\r\nbehind, but it was soon apparent that the unknown ships could keep up\r\nwith her. In fact were closing in.\r\n\r\nThere was one pursuer behind them that seemed to Kendall, as he\r\nwatched through the lens, almost to be upon them. It was, he knew,\r\nsome half-mile away in reality. He could see the curiously pitted nose\r\nof the craft, note the weirdly-streamlined mass. He observed, with\r\nastonishment, a little piece of wire seemingly flying loose from a\r\nbearing on one of the strange ships, which was streaming off behind as\r\nif in a stiff breeze. Yet space about them was empty!\r\n\r\n"Look out!" called Seaward from the forward scope. 

"Here\'s more of\r\nthem."\r\n\r\nComing around the planet from behind, spreading out along the side as\r\nif to form a welcoming arch were more of the weird ships.\r\n\r\n"That ties it," exclaimed Broster. "We\'ll never be able to pass the\r\nplanet. It\'s either land or crash."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "_We\'ll never be able to pass the planet. It\'s either\r\nland or crash._"]\r\n\r\n"Then we crash," came the response.\r\n\r\n"Man the guns!" yelled Broster. 

"Let\'s see how many we can take with us\r\nbefore we go."\r\n\r\nThe three others swung in the various weapons and trained them on the\r\nsurrounding ships. Explosion-torpedo cannon, twin-rays for electric\r\njolting comprised the types of offensive guns. They were getting\r\nvery close to the planet, now. And it seemed as if the red ships\r\nwere expecting the _Astralite_ to slow down, for their beams shot\r\noccasionally in front of the earth-ship. The carmine bulk of the\r\nplanet loomed up over most of the view now. It was too late to shunt\r\naside.\r\n\r\n"Fire!"\r\n\r\nNo sound, no roar of explosions. They watched eagerly for results. 

But\r\nthere were none. Not a single torpedo appeared to have hit its mark,\r\nnot a single twin-ray seemed to bathe the surrounding ovoids. They\r\nfired again.\r\n\r\nKendall swore. The course of one torpedo was the stimulus; he watched\r\nit, saw its dark mass approach the nose of one of the vessels behind.\r\nThen he swears he saw it strike--and disappear.\r\n\r\nFiring was useless. These ships were invulnerable to their weapons.\r\n\r\nBroster looked up, bracing himself.\r\n\r\n"Stand by to crash!"\r\n\r\nThe four stopped everything, turned to look at each other for a moment\r\nin silence. In a few seconds more they would simply cease to exist. 

No\r\npain, no hours of lingering agony trapped in the wreckage. At the speed\r\nthey were going, the entire ship would be volatilized, would fuse into\r\na molten, glowing mass.\r\n\r\nThey turned again to the plates to look for a last time at the universe\r\naround them.\r\n\r\nFor six years they had traveled away from earth, far, far beyond any\r\npoint man had ever dreamed of reaching. They were almost to the point\r\nwhere the order to turn back would have been given. Much had been\r\nlearned; now it would be lost.\r\n\r\nBroster gave her full acceleration.\r\n\r\nThey saw the planet seemingly leap toward them, saw cloudbanks flick\r\npast them. A great flat plain of ruddy rock, a dread expanse of barren\r\ngranite. This in the veriest fragment of a second, then--\r\n\r\nA momentary shock, as if each man had received an electrical jolt; a\r\nsudden flash of intolerable red. Darkness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe earthmen blinked their eyes.\r\n\r\nThey were in the ship, unharmed. They stood at their posts in the same\r\nposition as before. And about them the black of far space and the\r\nshining points of the star-studded Milky Way.\r\n\r\nKendall gazed into the lens of the rear port, beckoned to the others.\r\nThe red planet was already a small, crimson disk behind them, passing\r\ninto oblivion as they accelerated onward, outward.\r\n\r\nBroster laughed. "It\'s all clear now. Why the space-chart seemingly did\r\nnot function, why our weapons were useless."\r\n\r\n"And why we were not killed, and why their beams could be seen in\r\nspace," added Seaward.\r\n\r\n"Because they weren\'t in space; they were in air. In the air of another\r\nuniverse."\r\n\r\n"It was all an illusion," explained Seaward. "The ships, the planet,\r\neverything. That is why none of these things registered on the space\r\nchart; there were no gravity waves emanating from them because they\r\nwere not there."\r\n\r\nBroster leaned back in his chair. "We\'ve all known that there are many\r\nuniverses beside ours, separated from us by the fourth-dimensional\r\nspace-time sheet. That was demonstrated by Marilus centuries ago.\r\nLaboratory experiments have produced images of other planets. All this\r\nwas just such an image.\r\n\r\n"The space-time envelope must have been a little warped at this point.\r\nEnough so as to let part of the waves emanating from the atoms of that\r\nsection to pass through to our universe--and permit waves emanating\r\nfrom the atoms of our universe to pass through to them. We were able\r\nto see the red rays of their spectrum, nothing else. They saw us as a\r\nviolet ship. But that was all."\r\n\r\n"Then," put in Kendall, "that\'s why they seemed to be shooting rays at\r\nus."\r\n\r\n"Right. We appeared to them, in their world, as suddenly as they\r\nappeared to us in space; it was a double mirage. At one end of the\r\nwarp, they and their planet suddenly appear in what the instruments\r\nshow to be empty space; at the other end, we appear out of nowhere, a\r\nstrange ship headed for their planet. And, it must have seemed to them,\r\nthat we went right through their planet, too. That planet of theirs, by\r\nthe way, must be a tremendous one. Many times the mass and density of\r\nJupiter. It\'s probably what causes the space-warp."\r\n\r\n"What!" exclaimed Kendall. "You mean that thing\'s a permanent\r\ninstitution in space?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly.

"\r\n\r\n"Then let\'s go back and have a good look."\r\n\r\n"Check," agreed Broster.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll give their fleet and their planet the jitters again," laughed\r\nSeaward as he prepared the plates for special photos.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis section of New Sante Fe was off my beaten track. I\'ve been on Mars\r\na long time and am more than usually familiar with the various centers\r\nwhere we Terrans do our congregating. However, it\'d been years since\r\nI\'d come through here.\r\n\r\nI was sitting in an obscure tavern, called, with commendable restraint,\r\nsimply Sam\'s Bar, lapping up Martian brandy and facing the prospect of\r\nreturning to the spaceport in a few hours with no particular enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nI only half-noticed the old man who got up on the stool next to me. Sam\r\ncame over and asked him what he\'d have.\r\n\r\nThe oldster carefully counted out some coins on the bar and said,\r\n"Wine, Sam; a glass of Martian wine."\r\n\r\n"You know I don\'t want your money, Joseph," Sam told him.\r\n\r\nThe old man answered reproachfully, "The wine would taste that much the\r\nless, my friend, if I had not earned it by the sweat of my...."\r\n\r\n"Okay," Sam sighed. He poured the wine and rang up the money and went\r\noff to wait on someone else.\r\n\r\nA halftripper sidled up to me. "How about a drink, spaceman?" 

he\r\nwhined. "I\'m a graduate of the academy myself, class of \'72." He must\r\nhave noted my United Space Lines uniform.\r\n\r\n"Sorry," I said gruffly, keeping my back to him. Any spaceman can tell\r\nyou that if you talk to a halftripper for long you\'ll soon be showing\r\nsymptoms of space cafard yourself. The underlying terror in him; the\r\nmind shattering fear of space; the way he stares at you, thinking that\r\nyou can go home, while he is afraid to risk the trip. There are few of\r\nthem that can hide their disease.\r\n\r\n"I need a shot bad," he whispered urgently. He probably did, too. Few\r\nhalftrippers are able to secure jobs on the planets of their exile.\r\nMost of them become beachcombers of space. Of course, there are some\r\nexceptions, especially if they have money and connections.\r\n\r\nI shuddered. "Beat it," I grated, hating myself and him.\r\n\r\nThe fear of space cafard must be somewhat similar to that of\r\nseasickness every new sailor had back in ancient days when man sailed\r\nthe oceans of Terra. He never knew until he made his first voyage if he\r\nwas going to be susceptible; and, if he turned out to be, it meant the\r\nsea wasn\'t for him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf course, space cafard goes tragically further. A new man usually\r\nsuccumbs his first few hours in space, if he is going to get it at\r\nall. He probably makes it to the next planet, sometimes not; sometimes\r\nhe goes incurably mad, right off the bat. But even if he does make\r\nit, wild horses could never get him on another rocketship. He becomes\r\na halftripper, marooned on an alien world. Usually, although I have\r\nknown of several exceptions, if you don\'t get it on your first trip, it\r\nseldom bothers you; you\'re immune for the rest of your life.\r\n\r\nHe repeated, "How about it, spaceman?"\r\n\r\nSam began to approach threateningly. 

He couldn\'t afford to have\r\nhalftrippers hang out in his place. For one thing, the shipping lines\r\nwould soon declare him out of bounds for their crews. You just can\'t\r\nlet good men come in contact with obvious victims of space cafard.\r\n\r\nThe old-timer Sam had called Joseph was distressed. "You know not what\r\nyou say," he told me gently.\r\n\r\nI managed a sneer. "Am I supposed to buy a drink for every spacebum\r\nthat comes along?"\r\n\r\nThe halftripper\'s eyes lit up and he came closer to the old man. "How\r\nabout it, pop? Could you loan me the price of a nip of woji?"\r\n\r\nJoseph\'s face was compassionate. "I am sorry, brother, I myself have\r\nnothing, but I commend you to the generosity of the tavern keeper."\r\n\r\nI snorted at that. I could imagine how much generosity the space leper\r\nwould get from the bartender.\r\n\r\nThat\'s where the surprise came. Sam sighed. "Okay, halftripper, what\'ll\r\nit be?"\r\n\r\nThe spacebum ordered a double woji, got it down quickly, as though he\r\nwas afraid Sam might change his mind, and then beat it to find a place\r\nto have his dreams when the full force of the also-narcotic drink hit\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nI finished my brandy, ordered another, and grinned wryly at the\r\nold-timer. "You give me kert for telling him to beat it, but you give\r\nSam the high sign to let him have woji with which to rot out his\r\nbrains. 

I\'d think I was being the kinder of the two of us."\r\n\r\n"Each man\'s salvation is within himself," Joseph said softly. "You\r\nwon\'t redeem him by attempting to keep him from his weaknesses."\r\n\r\n"You talk like a saint but I notice you\'re sitting here at a bar."\r\n\r\nHe looked at me penetratingly, and there was vast emptiness behind\r\nhis eyes. "There is little to enjoy in life," he said softly, "but\r\nI have had ample time to investigate all of the supposed pleasures.\r\nAt one time I drank greatly and kept myself in a state of continual\r\nintoxication for a period longer than you could believe. Then I went\r\nthrough a state when I let nothing pass my lips but water. Now I see\r\nthe mistake of both extremes and can enjoy an occasional glass without\r\nfeeling the need of swilling it down until intoxication dulls me."\r\n\r\nHe had me interested now. I said, "You sound as though you\'ve found the\r\nway in which to get the greatest satisfaction from everything in life\r\nbut I notice that you don\'t appear particularly happy."\r\n\r\nHe was silent for a long time. Finally he sighed and answered,\r\n"Happiness is not to be found in wine, nor in food, nor in beautiful\r\nwomen, nor even in wealth and power. It is from within, what you have\r\ndone, what you are in the eyes of your fellow man."\r\n\r\nHe looked as though he was about to say more, but he fell silent, his\r\neyes on something far away, although he seemed to be looking directly\r\ninto my face. Then a light returned to them and he came back to our\r\nconversation. "I am sorry," he said. "For a moment you reminded me of\r\nsomeone I knew long and long ago. But now I must be on my way." He left\r\nhis drink half-finished on the bar and walked wearily to the door.\r\n\r\nSam took his glass away and wiped the bar reflectively. "Whenever\r\nhe\'s here, I can\'t turn down any halftrippers or other spacebums," he\r\ncomplained. "I tried it once, and the old boy looked so pathetic that I\r\ndamn near cried myself."\r\n\r\n"He seems to be quite a character," I said, only half-interested.\r\n\r\n"Sure," Sam said. "Haven\'t you heard about Joseph? He\'s immortal."\r\n\r\n"What?" I said, startled.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Immortal. You know, he lives forever." He poured me another brandy and\r\nleaned on the bar. His other customers had left and he was obviously in\r\nthe mood for talking.\r\n\r\n"I thought everybody knew about Joseph," he went on. "He was one of the\r\nfirst spacebarons, a real bigshot, controlled the whole of Calypso; him\r\nand his brother. They not only personally owned all of the satellite,\r\nbut even all of the space lines that served it. When it came to law\r\nthere, he was judge, jury, and owner of the courthouse and jail.\r\nBrother, that was one monopoly."\r\n\r\n"You mean that old man that was just here?" 

I said in amazement.\r\n\r\n"That\'s right. Joseph, we call him now. He probably had a longer name\r\nthen. It was a long time ago.\r\n\r\n"Anyway, to get back to the story, one day a space liner radios in\r\nthat it wants to make an emergency landing on Calypso for medical\r\nassistance. They had some virulent disease on board and the passengers\r\nand crew were dying like flies.\r\n\r\n"Well, this brother of Joseph, Micheal, or something like that his name\r\nwas, advises Joseph not to give them permission to land. The captain of\r\nthe liner pleads with him, but Joseph tells him to move on, he doesn\'t\r\nwant to take any chances. The ship tried to make the next port, I\r\nforget just what it was, but, anyway, to cut it short, they all died.\r\nThat\'s what started things churning in Joseph\'s bailiwick; a full-scale\r\nrevolution, no less."\r\n\r\n"You missed something there," I said. 

"The people wouldn\'t have been\r\nexpected to be so upset. After all, no matter how mistaken, he must\r\nhave thought he was acting in the interests of everyone on Calypso."\r\n\r\n"Yeah," Sam pointed out, "but the thing is that among the passengers\r\nwas Joseph\'s own boy, the most popular person on the satellite and\r\nthe apple of his old man\'s eye. Nobody had known it, but the kid was\r\nplaying hookey from his school on Terra and was making a cruise of the\r\nJupiter moons.\r\n\r\n"Joseph himself had never been very popular with his people, neither\r\nhad this younger brother of his, Micheal. Too strict, see. 

But\r\neverybody liked the boy and were looking forward to the day when he\'d\r\ntake over the reins of government. When it came out what happened,\r\nthey went berserk. They cornered Joseph and Micheal and a dozen or so\r\nof their close associates in the palace, which was actually more of a\r\nfortress than anything else."\r\n\r\nSam wiped the bar again without need, and said reflectively, "It\r\nmust\'ve been quite a fight. Not that Joseph himself participated. The\r\nboy had been his whole life, and he just moved around like he was in a\r\ntrance.\r\n\r\n"They threw everything at that palace. Every weapon, every device, that\r\nhad been thought up for centuries; but it didn\'t crack. Finally, the\r\nfight was ended by a fleet of battle cruisers from Terra. Joseph and\r\nMicheal and the rest were removed and brought here to Mars. None of\r\nthem dared to remain on Calypso."\r\n\r\nI poured myself another brandy from the bottle that Sam had left on the\r\nbar. "You make quite a story of it," I told him, "but you didn\'t tell\r\nme what you\'d started to--about the immortality."\r\n\r\n"Yeah," he said, "that\'s right. Well, it seems that in the atomic\r\nbombardment of the palace something happened that wound up with Joseph\r\nand his friends all immortal. Don\'t ask me what; I don\'t know and\r\nneither did these scientist guys when they tried to figure it out. Of\r\ncourse, it didn\'t become known for years; not until it became obvious\r\nthey weren\'t dying, or even aging. They continued to appear as they had\r\nat the time of the fight. I don\'t mean they couldn\'t die at all; one by\r\none they dropped away. Two were lost in space; one was blown up in an\r\nexplosion on Terra; another was burned to death; but the only way they\r\ncould die was through accident--or suicide. After a few hundred years\r\nthey were all gone but Joseph, and, of course, he\'d gone batty."\r\n\r\nI interrupted. 

"You mean he\'s insane?"\r\n\r\nThe bartender grinned. "Crazy as a makron."\r\n\r\nI said slowly, "He seemed normal enough to me. Uh ... perhaps a bit\r\neccentric."\r\n\r\nSam said, "Brother, he\'s as far around the corner as you can get. You\r\nknow what he thinks? He thinks that he\'s wandering through space, going\r\nfrom planet to planet, trying to find a situation similar to that in\r\nwhich he sent away the person he loved most to his death. He thinks\r\nthat if he ever finds that similar situation, he\'ll be able to make the\r\nopposite decision from the one he made before and that will redeem him."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI frowned. "Where does he get the money for his wandering around the\r\nplanets?"\r\n\r\n"He don\'t need no money. He\'s good luck. There\'s not a captain in the\r\nsystem that would refuse free passage to old Joseph." Sam shrugged his\r\nbeefy shoulders. 

"And who am I to say otherwise? That\'s why I give the\r\nbums free drinks when he\'s around; so does every other bartender."\r\n\r\nTwo customers had entered and Sam made his way down to them, leaving me\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nA halftripper scurried through the door and cringed up to me. He\r\nwhimpered, "How about a drink, spaceman? I...."\r\n\r\nI flipped him a coin. "Sure, buddy," I said, repressing my usual nausea\r\nat the sight of him. 

I got down from my stool and made my way out. It\r\nwas time for me to return to the spaceport and my job.\r\n\r\nI suppose that I forgot to tell the cabbie to take me to the\r\nadministration building entrance--the first time I\'d made that mistake\r\nin years. I was preoccupied with thoughts of Joseph and the story Sam\r\nhad told of him. The guards at the main gate must have let us through\r\nwithout question when they saw my United Space Lines uniform. At any\r\nrate, when I looked up, it was too late. Not only was I on the landing\r\nfield and in full view of the concrete take-off aprons, but one\r\ngigantic freighter was in the process of blasting off.\r\n\r\nAll the horror of it flowed over me with a rush. The careful training\r\nof years; the work of the doctors who had treated me; all my own\r\nself-discipline--were gone. I shook with terrified frenzy. The depths\r\nof space! The free fall! 

The black emptiness! The utter, uncontrollable\r\nterror!\r\n\r\nI screamed shrilly and the cabbie turned, wide-eyed, to stare at me.\r\n\r\nHe knew the symptoms. "Space cafard! A halftripper!" he gasped, and\r\nspun the cab about to get me to a hospital. He must have realized then\r\nthat my uniform didn\'t necessarily mean that I worked on the liners\r\nthemselves, but that I could be an office employee who only on rare\r\noccasions went near the ships.\r\n\r\nHe knew too, that the very sight of a spacecraft blasting off was\r\nenough to put me in bed for a week; and that I was uncommonly lucky to\r\nhave the funds for the hospitalization. Mars was strewn with the human\r\nwrecks of halftrippers who hadn\'t.\r\n\r\nAs we whirled from the yard, we passed the bent figure of Joseph\r\nwalking unhurriedly toward a liner which was loading for the Venus run.\r\n\r\nMy heart cried out, even through my terror, my sickness:\r\n\r\n_Joseph, Joseph.... So you too are still alive; and still seeking\r\nforgiveness. I had thought I was the last._\r\n\r\n_But you are by far the better off of we two, Joseph. For at least you\r\nhave been free to wander while I have stayed on this one hated spot\r\nsince all those centuries ago when we fled from Calypso and the wrath\r\nof the people who had loved the boy so. As though we hadn\'t loved him\r\nourselves, Joseph._\r\n\r\n_Yes, you are the better off, you can seek throughout the stars for\r\nforgiveness. Then, too, your mind is forever dulled with your madness,\r\nwhile mine is horribly aware, always, of what we\'ve been through and of\r\nthe centuries ahead; it is only blurred when the space cafard comes._\r\n\r\n_Joseph, Joseph ... you didn\'t even recognize your brother Micheal, nor\r\nI you, when we met._\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n

You\r\ngive it something neutral, some name like the Manhattan and Overlord\r\nthey used in World War II, which won\'t excite anybody\'s curiosity.\r\n\r\nBut we were stuck with Project Hush and we had to take extra measures to\r\nensure secrecy. A couple of times a week, everyone on the project had to\r\nreport to Psycho for DD & HA--dream detailing and hypnoanalysis--instead\r\nof the usual monthly visit. Naturally, the commanding general of the\r\nheavily fortified research post to which we were attached could not ask\r\nwhat we were doing, under penalty of court-martial, but he had to be\r\ngiven further instructions to shut off his imagination like a faucet\r\nevery time he heard an explosion. Some idiot in Washington was actually\r\ngoing to list Project Hush in the military budget by name! It took fast\r\naction, I can tell you, to have it entered under Miscellaneous "X"\r\nResearch.\r\n\r\nWell, we\'d covered the unforgivable blunder, though not easily, and now\r\nwe could get down to the real business of the project. You know, of\r\ncourse, about the A-bomb, H-bomb and C-bomb because information that\r\nthey existed had been declassified. You don\'t know about the other\r\nweapons being devised--and neither did we, reasonably enough, since they\r\nweren\'t our business--but we had been given properly guarded\r\nnotification that they were in the works. Project Hush was set up to\r\ncounter the new weapons.\r\n\r\nOur goal was not just to reach the Moon. We had done that on 24 June\r\n1967 with an unmanned ship that carried instruments to report back data\r\non soil, temperature, cosmic rays and so on. Unfortunately, it was put\r\nout of commission by a rock slide.\r\n\r\nAn unmanned rocket would be useless against the new weapons. We had to\r\nget to the Moon before any other country did and set up a permanent\r\nstation--an armed one--and do it without anybody else knowing about it.\r\n\r\nI guess you see now why we on (_damn_ the name!) Project Hush were so\r\nconcerned about security. But we felt pretty sure, before we took off,\r\nthat we had plugged every possible leak.\r\n\r\nWe had, all right. Nobody even knew we had raised ship.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe landed at the northern tip of Mare Nubium, just off Regiomontanus,\r\nand, after planting a flag with appropriate throat-catching ceremony,\r\nhad swung into the realities of the tasks we had practiced on so many\r\ndry runs back on Earth. Major Monroe Gridley prepared the big rocket,\r\nwith its tiny cubicle of living space, for the return journey to Earth\r\nwhich he alone would make.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-colonel Thomas Hawthorne painstakingly examined our\r\nprovisions and portable quarters for any damage that might have been\r\nincurred in landing.\r\n\r\nAnd I, Colonel Benjamin Rice, first commanding officer of Army Base No.\r\n1 on the Moon, dragged crate after enormous crate out of the ship on my\r\naching academic back, and piled them in the spot two hundred feet away\r\nwhere the plastic dome would be built.\r\n\r\nWe all finished at just about the same time, as per schedule, and went\r\ninto Phase Two.\r\n\r\nMonroe and I started work on building the dome. It was a simple pre-fab\r\naffair, but big enough to require an awful lot of assembling. Then,\r\nafter it was built, we faced the real problem--getting all the complex\r\ninternal machinery in place and in operating order.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Tom Hawthorne took his plump self off in the single-seater\r\nrocket which, up to then, had doubled as a lifeboat.\r\n\r\nThe schedule called for him to make a rough three-hour scouting survey\r\nin an ever-widening spiral from our dome. This had been regarded as a\r\nprobable waste of time, rocket fuel and manpower--but a necessary\r\nprecaution. He was supposed to watch for such things as bug-eyed\r\nmonsters out for a stroll on the Lunar landscape. Basically, however,\r\nTom\'s survey was intended to supply extra geological and astronomical\r\nmeat for the report which Monroe was to carry back to Army HQ on Earth.\r\n\r\nTom was back in forty minutes. His round face, inside its transparent\r\nbubble helmet, was fish-belly white. And so were ours, once he told us\r\nwhat he\'d seen.\r\n\r\nHe had seen another dome.\r\n\r\n"The other side of Mare Nubium--in the Riphaen Mountains," he babbled\r\nexcitedly. "It\'s a little bigger than ours, and it\'s a little flatter on\r\ntop. And it\'s not translucent, either, with splotches of different\r\ncolors here and there--it\'s a dull, dark, heavy gray. But that\'s all\r\nthere is to see."\r\n\r\n"No markings on the dome?" I asked worriedly. "No signs of anyone--or\r\nanything--around it?"\r\n\r\n"Neither, Colonel." I noticed he was calling me by my rank for the first\r\ntime since the trip started, which meant he was saying in effect, "Man,\r\nhave you got a decision to make!"\r\n\r\n"Hey, Tom," Monroe put in. "Couldn\'t be just a regularly shaped bump in\r\nthe ground, could it?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m a geologist, Monroe. I can distinguish artificial from natural\r\ntopography. Besides--" he looked up--"I just remembered something I left\r\nout. There\'s a brand-new tiny crater near the dome--the kind usually\r\nleft by a rocket exhaust."\r\n\r\n"Rocket exhaust?" I seized on that. "_Rockets_, eh?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTom grinned a little sympathetically. "Spaceship exhaust, I should have\r\nsaid. You can\'t tell from the crater what kind of propulsive device\r\nthese characters are using. It\'s not the same kind of crater our\r\nrear-jets leave, if that helps any.

"\r\n\r\nOf course it didn\'t. So we went into our ship and had a council of war.\r\nAnd I do mean war. Both Tom and Monroe were calling me Colonel in every\r\nother sentence. I used their first names every chance I got.\r\n\r\nStill, no one but me could reach a decision. 

About what to do, I mean.\r\n\r\n"Look," I said at last, "here are the possibilities. They know we are\r\nhere--either from watching us land a couple of hours ago or from\r\nobserving Tom\'s scout-ship--or they do not know we are here. They are\r\neither humans from Earth--in which case they are in all probability\r\nenemy nationals--or they are alien creatures from another planet--in\r\nwhich case they may be friends, enemies or what-have-you. I think common\r\nsense and standard military procedure demand that we consider them\r\nhostile until we have evidence to the contrary. Meanwhile, we proceed\r\nwith extreme caution, so as not to precipitate an interplanetary war\r\nwith potentially friendly Martians, or whatever they are.\r\n\r\n"All right. It\'s vitally important that Army Headquarters be informed of\r\nthis immediately. But since Moon-to-Earth radio is still on the drawing\r\nboards, the only way we can get through is to send Monroe back with the\r\nship. If we do, we run the risk of having our garrison force, Tom and\r\nme, captured while he\'s making the return trip. In that case, their side\r\nwinds up in possession of important information concerning our personnel\r\nand equipment, while our side has only the bare knowledge that somebody\r\nor something else has a base on the Moon. So our primary need is more\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n"Therefore, I suggest that I sit in the dome on one end of a telephone\r\nhookup with Tom, who will sit in the ship, his hand over the firing\r\nbutton, ready to blast off for Earth the moment he gets the order from\r\nme. Monroe will take the single-seater down to the Riphaen Mountains,\r\nlanding as close to the other dome as he thinks safe. He will then\r\nproceed the rest of the way on foot, doing the best scouting job he can\r\nin a spacesuit.\r\n\r\n"He will not use his radio, except for agreed-upon nonsense syllables to\r\ndesignate landing the single-seater, coming upon the dome by foot, and\r\nwarning me to tell Tom to take off. If he\'s captured, remembering that\r\nthe first purpose of a scout is acquiring and transmitting knowledge of\r\nthe enemy, he will snap his suit radio on full volume and pass on as\r\nmuch data as time and the enemy\'s reflexes permit. How does that sound\r\nto you?

"\r\n\r\nThey both nodded. As far as they were concerned, the command decision\r\nhad been made. But I was sitting under two inches of sweat.\r\n\r\n"One question," Tom said. "Why did you pick Monroe for the scout?"\r\n\r\n"I was afraid you\'d ask that," I told him. "We\'re three extremely\r\nunathletic Ph.D.s who have been in the Army since we finished our\r\nschooling. There isn\'t too much choice. But I remembered that Monroe is\r\nhalf Indian--Arapahoe, isn\'t it, Monroe?--and I\'m hoping blood will\r\ntell."\r\n\r\n"Only trouble, Colonel," Monroe said slowly as he rose, "is that I\'m\r\none-_fourth_ Indian and even that.... Didn\'t I ever tell you that my\r\ngreat-grandfather was the only Arapahoe scout who was with Custer at the\r\nLittle Big Horn? He\'d been positive Sitting Bull was miles away.\r\nHowever, I\'ll do my best. And if I heroically don\'t come back, would you\r\nplease persuade the Security Officer of our section to clear my name for\r\nuse in the history books? Under the circumstances, I think it\'s the\r\nleast he could do."\r\n\r\nI promised to do my best, of course.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter he took off, I sat in the dome over the telephone connection to\r\nTom and hated myself for picking Monroe to do the job. But I\'d have\r\nhated myself just as much for picking Tom. And if anything happened and\r\nI had to tell Tom to blast off, I\'d probably be sitting here in the dome\r\nall by myself after that, waiting....\r\n\r\n"_Broz neggle!_" came over the radio in Monroe\'s resonant voice. He had\r\nlanded the single-seater.\r\n\r\nI didn\'t dare use the telephone to chat with Tom in the ship, for fear I\r\nmight miss an important word or phrase from our scout. So I sat and sat\r\nand strained my ears. After a while, I heard "_Mishgashu!_" which told\r\nme that Monroe was in the neighborhood of the other dome and was\r\ncreeping toward it under cover of whatever boulders were around.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAnd then, abruptly, I heard Monroe yell my name and there was a terrific\r\nclattering in my headphones. Radio interference! He\'d been caught, and\r\nwhoever had caught him had simultaneously jammed his suit transmitter\r\nwith a larger transmitter from the alien dome.\r\n\r\nThen there was silence.\r\n\r\nAfter a while, I told Tom what had happened. He just said, "Poor\r\nMonroe." I had a good idea of what his expression was like.\r\n\r\n"Look, Tom," I said, "if you take off now, you still won\'t have anything\r\nimportant to tell. After capturing Monroe, whatever\'s in that other dome\r\nwill come looking for us, I think. I\'ll let them get close enough for us\r\nto learn something of their appearance--at least if they\'re human or\r\nnon-human. Any bit of information about them is important. I\'ll shout it\r\nup to you and you\'ll still be able to take off in plenty of time. 

All\r\nright?"\r\n\r\n"You\'re the boss, Colonel," he said in a mournful voice. "Lots of luck.

"\r\n\r\nAnd then there was nothing to do but wait. There was no oxygen system in\r\nthe dome yet, so I had to squeeze up a sandwich from the food\r\ncompartment in my suit. I sat there, thinking about the expedition. Nine\r\nyears, and all that careful secrecy, all that expenditure of money and\r\nmind-cracking research--and it had come to this. Waiting to be wiped\r\nout, in a blast from some unimaginable weapon. I understood Monroe\'s\r\nlast request. We often felt we were so secret that our immediate\r\nsuperiors didn\'t even want us to know what we we were working on.\r\nScientists are people--they wish for recognition, too. I was hoping the\r\nwhole expedition would be written up in the history books, but it looked\r\nunpromising.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwo hours later, the scout ship landed near the dome. The lock opened\r\nand, from where I stood in the open door of our dome, I saw Monroe come\r\nout and walk toward me.\r\n\r\nI alerted Tom and told him to listen carefully. "It may be a trick--he\r\nmight be drugged...."\r\n\r\nHe didn\'t act drugged, though--not exactly. He pushed his way past me\r\nand sat down on a box to one side of the dome. He put his booted feet up\r\non another, smaller box.\r\n\r\n"How are you, Ben?" he asked. 

"How\'s every little thing?"\r\n\r\nI grunted. "_Well?_" I know my voice skittered a bit.\r\n\r\nHe pretended puzzlement. "Well _what_? 

Oh, I see what you mean. The\r\nother dome--you want to know who\'s in it. You have a right to be\r\ncurious, Ben. Certainly. The leader of a top-secret expedition like\r\nthis--Project Hush they call us, huh, Ben--finds another dome on the\r\nMoon. He thinks he\'s been the first to land on it, so naturally he wants\r\nto--"\r\n\r\n"Major Monroe Gridley!" I rapped out. 

"You will come to attention and\r\ndeliver your report. 

Now!" Honestly, I felt my neck swelling up inside\r\nmy helmet.\r\n\r\nMonroe just leaned back against the side of the dome. "That\'s the _Army_\r\nway of doing things," he commented admiringly. "Like the recruits say,\r\nthere\'s a right way, a wrong way and an Army way. Only there are other\r\nways, too." He chuckled. "Lots of other ways."\r\n\r\n"He\'s off," I heard Tom whisper over the telephone. "Ben, Monroe has\r\ngone and blown his stack."\r\n\r\n"They aren\'t extraterrestrials in the other dome, Ben," Monroe\r\nvolunteered in a sudden burst of sanity. "No, they\'re human, all right,\r\nand from Earth. 

Guess _where_."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll kill you," I warned him. "I swear I\'ll kill you, Monroe. Where are\r\nthey from--Russia, China, Argentina?"\r\n\r\nHe grimaced. "What\'s so secret about those places? Go on!--guess again."\r\n\r\nI stared at him long and hard. "The only place else--"\r\n\r\n"Sure," he said. 

"You got it, Colonel. The other dome is owned and\r\noperated by the Navy. The goddam United States Navy!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


Gregory, across\r\nthe room, flicked rapidly through the pages of a magazine, too rapidly\r\nto be reading anything, or even looking at the pictures. Ross lay\r\nquietly on his bunk, staring out of the viewport.\r\n\r\nThe four were strangely alike in appearance, nearly the same age, the\r\nage where gray hairs finally outnumber black, or baldness takes over.\r\nThe age when the expanding waistline has begun to sag tiredly, when\r\nrobust middle age begins the slow accelerating decline toward senility.\r\n\r\nA strange group to find aboard a spaceship, but then _The Columbus_ was\r\na very strange ship. Bolted to its outer hull, just under the viewports,\r\nwere wooden boxes full of red geraniums, and ivy wound tenuous green\r\nfronds over the gleaming hull that had withstood the bombardment of\r\npinpoint meteors and turned away the deadly power of naked cosmic rays.\r\n\r\nFrankston glanced at his wristchrono. It was one minute to six.\r\n\r\n"In about a minute," he thought, "Ross will say something about going\r\nout to water his geraniums." The wristchrono ticked fifty-nine times.\r\n\r\n"I think I\'ll go out and water my geraniums," said Ross.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNo one glanced up. Then Gregory threw his magazine on the floor. Ross\r\ngot up and walked, limping slightly, to a wall locker. He pulled out the\r\nheavy, ungainly spacesuit and the big metal bulb of a headpiece. He\r\ncarried them to his bunk and laid them carefully down.\r\n\r\n"Will somebody please help me on with my suit?" he asked.\r\n\r\nFor one more long moment, no one moved. Then James got up and began to\r\nhelp Ross fit his legs into the suit. Ross had arthritis, not badly, but\r\nenough so that he needed a little help climbing into a spacesuit.\r\n\r\nJames pulled the heavy folds of the suit up around Ross\'s body and held\r\nit while Ross extended his arms into the sleeve sections. His hands, in\r\nthe heavy gauntlets, were too unwieldy to do the front fastenings, and\r\nhe stood silently while James did it for him.\r\n\r\nRoss lifted the helmet, staring at it as a cripple might regard a\r\nwheelchair which he loathed but was wholly dependent upon. Then he\r\nfitted the helmet over his head and James fastened it down and lifted\r\nthe oxygen tank to his back.\r\n\r\n"Ready?" asked James.\r\n\r\nThe bulbous headpiece inclined in a nod. James walked to a panel and\r\nthrew a switch marked INNER LOCK. A round aperture slid silently open.\r\nRoss stepped through it and the door shut behind him as James threw the\r\nswitch back to its original position. Opposite the switch marked OUTER\r\nLOCK a signal glowed redly and James threw another switch. A moment\r\nlater the signal flickered out.\r\n\r\nFrankston, with a violent gesture, swept the checker board clean. Red\r\nand black men clattered to the floor, rolling and spinning. Nobody\r\npicked them up.\r\n\r\n"What does he do it for?" 

demanded Frankston in a tight voice. "What\r\ndoes he get out of those stinking geraniums he can\'t touch or smell?"\r\n\r\n"Shut up," said Gregory.\r\n\r\nJames looked up sharply. Curtness was unusual for Gregory, a bad sign.\r\nFrankston was the one he\'d been watching, the one who\'d shown signs of\r\ncracking, but after so long, even a psycho-expert\'s opinion might be\r\nhaywire. Who was a yardstick? Who was normal?\r\n\r\n"Geraniums don\'t smell much anyway," added Gregory in a more\r\nconciliatory tone.\r\n\r\n"Yeah," agreed Frankston, "I\'d forgotten that. But why does he torture\r\nhimself like this, and us, too?"\r\n\r\n"Because that\'s what he wanted to do," answered James.\r\n\r\n"Sure," agreed Gregory, "the whole trip--the last twenty years of it,\r\nanyhow--all he could talk about was how, when he got back to Earth, he\r\nwas going to buy a little place in the country and raise flowers."\r\n\r\n"Well, we\'re back," muttered Frankston, with a terrible bitterness.\r\n"He\'s raising flowers, but not in any little place in the country."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGregory continued almost dreamily, "Remember the last night out? We were\r\nall gathered around the viewscreen. And there was Earth, getting bigger\r\nand greener and closer all the time. Remember what it felt like to be\r\ngoing back, after thirty years?"\r\n\r\n"Thirty years cooped up in this ship," grumbled Frankston. "All our\r\ntwenties and thirties and forties ..."\r\n\r\n"But we were coming home." There was a rapt expression on Gregory\'s\r\nlined and weathered face. "We were looking forward to the twenty or\r\nmaybe thirty good years we had left, talking about what we\'d do, where\r\nwe\'d live, wondering what had changed on Earth. At least we had that\r\nlast night out. All the data was stashed away in the microfiles, all the\r\ndata about planets with air we couldn\'t breathe and food we couldn\'t\r\neat. 

We were going home, home to big, friendly, green Earth."\r\n\r\nFrankston\'s face suddenly crumpled as though he were about to weep and\r\nhe cradled his head against his arms. "God, do we have to go over it all\r\nagain? 

Not again tonight!"\r\n\r\n"Leave him alone," ordered James with an inflection of command in his\r\nvoice. "Go to the other section of the ship if you don\'t want to listen.\r\nHe has to keep going over it, just like Ross has to keep watering his\r\ngeraniums."\r\n\r\nFrankston remained motionless and Gregory looked gratefully at James.\r\nJames was the steady one. It was easier for him because he understood.\r\n\r\nGregory\'s face became more and more animated as he lost himself, living\r\nagain his recollections: "The day we blasted in. The crowds. 

Thousands\r\nof people, all there to see us come in. We were proud. Of course, we\r\nthought we were the first to land, just like we\'d been the first to go\r\nout. Those cheers, coming from thousands of people at once. For us.\r\nRoss-- Lt. Ross--was the first one out of the lock. We\'d decided on\r\nthat; he\'d been in command for almost ten years, ever since Commander\r\nStevens died. You remember Stevens, don\'t you? He took over when we lost\r\nCaptain Willers. Well, anyway, Ross out first, and then you, James, and\r\nyou, Frankston, and then Trippitt, and me last, because you were all\r\nspecialists and I was just a crewman. _The_ crewman, I should say, the\r\nonly one left.\r\n\r\n"Ross hesitated and almost stumbled when he stepped out, and tears began\r\npouring from his eyes, but I thought--well, you know, coming home after\r\nthirty years and all that. But when I stepped out of the lock, my eyes\r\nstung like fire and a thousand needles seemed to jab at my skin.\r\n\r\n"And then the President himself stepped forward with the flowers. That\'s\r\nwhere the real trouble began, with the flowers. I remember Ross\r\nstretching out his arms to take the bouquet, like a mother reaching for\r\na baby. Then suddenly he dropped them, sneezing and coughing and sobbing\r\nfor breath, and the President reached out to help him, asking him over\r\nand over what was wrong.\r\n\r\n"It was the same with all of us, and we turned and staggered back to the\r\nship, closing the lock behind us. It was bad then. 

God, I\'ll never\r\nforget it! The five of us, moaning in agony, gasping for breath, our\r\neyes all swollen shut, and the itching ... that itching." Gregory\r\nshuddered.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEven the emotionally disciplined James set his teeth and felt his scalp\r\ncrawl at the memory of that horror. He glanced toward the viewport, as\r\nthough to cleanse his mind of the memory. He could see Ross out there,\r\namong the geraniums, moving slowly and painfully in his heavy spacesuit.\r\nOccupational therapy. Ross watered flowers and Gregory talked and\r\nFrankston was bitter and ... himself? Observation, maybe.\r\n\r\nGregory\'s voice began again, "And then they were pounding on the lock,\r\nbegging us to let the doctor in, but we were all rolling and thrashing\r\nwith the itching, burning, sneezing, and finally James got himself under\r\ncontrol enough to open the locks and let them in.\r\n\r\n"Then came the tests, allergy tests. Remember those? They\'d cut a little\r\nrow of scratches in your arm ..." Each man instinctively glanced at his\r\nforearm, saw neat rows of tiny pink scars, row on row. "Then they\'d put\r\na little powder in each cut and each kind of powder was an extract of\r\nsome common substance we might be allergic to. The charts they made were\r\nfull of \'P\'s, P for positive, long columns of big, red \'P\'s. All pollen,\r\ndust, wool, nylon, cotton, fish, meat, fruit, vegetables, grain, milk,\r\nwhisky, cigarettes, dogs, cats--everything! And wasn\'t it funny about us\r\nbeing allergic to women\'s face powder? Ha! We were allergic to women\r\nfrom their nylon hose to their face powder.\r\n\r\n"Thirty years of breathing purified, sterilized, filtered air, thirty\r\nyears of drinking distilled water and swallowing synthetic food tablets\r\nhad changed us. The only things we weren\'t allergic to were the metal\r\nand plastic and synthetics of our ship, _this_ ship. We\'re allergic to\r\nEarth. That\'s funny, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\nGregory began to rock back and forth, laughing the thin high laugh of\r\nhysteria. James silently walked to a water hydrant and filled a plastic\r\ncup. He brought Gregory a small white pill.\r\n\r\n"You wouldn\'t take this with the rest of us at supper. You\'d better take\r\nit now. 

You need it."\r\n\r\nGregory nodded bleakly, sobering at once, and swallowed the pellet. He\r\nmade a face after the water.\r\n\r\n"Distilled," he spat. "Distilled ... no flavor ... no life ... like\r\nus ... distilled."\r\n\r\n"If only we could have blasted off again." Frankston\'s voice came\r\nmuffled through his hands. "It wouldn\'t have made any difference where.\r\nAnywhere or nowhere. No, our fine ship is obsolete and we\'re old, much\r\ntoo old. They have the spacedrive now. Men don\'t make thirty-year\r\njunkets into space and come back allergic to Earth. They go out, and in\r\na month or two they\'re back, with their hair still black and their eyes\r\nstill bright and their uniforms still fit. A month or two is all. Those\r\ncrowds that cheered us, they were proud of us and sorry for us, because\r\nwe\'d been out thirty years and they never expected us back at all. But\r\nit was inconvenient for Spaceport." Bitter sarcasm tinged his voice.\r\n"They actually had to postpone the regular monthly Trans-Galactic run\r\nto let us in with this big, clumsy hulk."\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t we ever see any of the new ships either going out or coming\r\nback?" asked Gregory.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrankston shook his head. "You don\'t see a ship when it\'s in spacedrive.\r\nIt\'s out of normal space-time dimensions. We had a smattering of the\r\ntheory at cadet school ... anyway, if one did flash into normal\r\nspace-time--say, for instance, coming in for a landing--the probability\r\nof us being at the same place at the same time was almost nil. \'Two\r\nships passing in the night\' as the old saying goes."\r\n\r\nGregory nodded, "I guess Trippitt was the lucky one."\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t see Trippitt die," replied James.\r\n\r\n"What was it?" asked Frankston. "What killed Trippitt? So quickly, too.\r\nHe was only outside a few minutes like the rest of us, and eight hours\r\nlater he was dead."\r\n\r\n"We couldn\'t be sure," answered James. "Some virus. 

There are countless\r\nvarieties. People live in a contaminated atmosphere all their lives,\r\nbuild up a resistance to them. Sometimes a particularly virulent strain\r\nwill produce an epidemic, but most people, if they\'re affected, will\r\nhave a mild case of whatever it is and recover. But after thirty years\r\nin space, thirty years of breathing perfectly pure, uncontaminated air,\r\nTrippitt had no antibodies in his bloodstream. The virus hit and he\r\ndied."\r\n\r\n"But why didn\'t the rest of us get it?" asked Gregory.\r\n\r\n"We were lucky. Viruses are like that."\r\n\r\n"Those people talked about building a home for us," muttered Frankston.\r\n"Why didn\'t they?"\r\n\r\n"It wouldn\'t have been any different," answered James gently. "It would\r\nhave been the same, almost an exact duplicate of the ship, everything\r\nbut the rockets. Same metal and plastic and filtered air and synthetic\r\nfood. It couldn\'t have had wool rugs or down pillows or smiling wives or\r\nfresh air or eggs for breakfast. 

It would have been just like this. So,\r\nsince the ship was obsolete, they gave it to us, and a plot of ground to\r\nanchor it to, and we\'re home. They did the best they could for us, the\r\nvery best they could."\r\n\r\n"But I feel stifled, shut in!"\r\n\r\n"The ship is large, Frankston. We all crowd into this section because,\r\nwithout each other, we\'d go mad." James kicked the edge of the magazine\r\non the floor. "Thank God we\'re not allergic to decontaminated paper.\r\nThere\'s still reading."\r\n\r\n"We\'re getting old," said Gregory. 

"Some day one of us will be here\r\nalone."\r\n\r\n"God help him then," answered James, with more emotion than was usual\r\nfor him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of the conversation, the little red signal had\r\nbeen flashing persistently. Finally James saw it. Ross was in the outer\r\nlock. James threw the decontaminator switch and the signal winked out.\r\nEvery trace of dust and pollen would have to be removed from Ross\'s suit\r\nbefore he could come inside the ship.\r\n\r\n"Just like on an alien planet," commented Gregory.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t that what this is to us--an alien planet?" asked Frankston, and\r\nneither of the other men dared answer his bitter question.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later, Ross was back in the cabin, and James helped him\r\nout of his spacesuit.\r\n\r\n"How are the geraniums, Ross?" asked Gregory.\r\n\r\n"Fine," said Ross enthusiastically. "They\'re doing just fine."\r\n\r\nHe walked over to his bunk and lay down on his side so he could see out\r\nof the viewport. 

There would be an hour left before darkness fell, an\r\nhour to watch the geraniums. They were tall and red, and swayed slightly\r\nin the evening breeze.\r\n\r\n                                                         --LYN VENABLE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Galaxy Science Fiction_ December 1952.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n"_Oh, he is dead!" my mind cried out._\r\n\r\nNovna, my dear, I am writing this as a release for my conscience.\r\nThose things which trouble me are not such as one exchanges with vigil\r\ncompanions, or indeed with anyone not bound by ties like ours.\r\n\r\nIf I were at home with you I would exchange with your soul in a moment\r\nthe feeling of my own, but distance permits no such consolation and it\r\nis not suitable for me to exchange so familiarly with my colleagues.\r\n\r\nI find myself questioning the value of our customary refusal to\r\ncommunicate thoughts of a delicate and sensitive nature. The Earth\r\npeople, who speak their thoughts, perhaps are less primitive than\r\nwe like to imagine. They seem to have no sense of the danger of\r\noverwhelming the soul of another with unwanted confidences. The purely\r\nvocal nature of their communication does not admit an excessive degree\r\nof emotion to their relationships. They do not have to erect any\r\nartificial barriers between each other, as we must who exchange on a\r\nmental level.\r\n\r\nThese doubts of mine never could have arisen if we men of Hainos had\r\nnot presumed to observe the alien ways of those creatures on the third\r\nEarth, so like ourselves and yet so remote, though we have hovered\r\nabove them, listening and watching, for twelve of their generations.\r\n\r\nThis vigil, though it is to last but one journey around the sun, has\r\nseemed longer and less fruitful than all the others. I think I shall\r\nnot come again, but leave such work to those who can remain efficient\r\nand disinterested Observers, unmoved by doubt and anxiety. Novna, you\r\nmust begin to think what we two shall do with the rest of our eternity,\r\nfor now that I have spent some small portion of mine in fifty vigils, I\r\nfind they have become distasteful. We might go to the Palace of Art and\r\nstudy to be poet-priests. My last vigil has convinced me that I am more\r\nfitted for that life than this.\r\n\r\nWhen our mission left Hainos for the third Earth, there was aboard our\r\nship the poet-priest Gven. You must remember the many nights we sat\r\nbeneath the rocks by the ocean, listening as his soul gave ours his\r\nsongs. Innocent they were, and filled with talk of purity and light,\r\nthough Gven is as old as the rest of us, even if he is as different\r\nfrom you and me as the Earth child is from its parents.\r\n\r\nYou have never seen him, I think. He is smaller than I, slight of\r\nbuild and tender-faced. How out of place he looked among the ship\'s\r\nsturdy men of science, with their ages of discipline and austerity\r\nwritten indelibly into their features. They did not want him. They told\r\nthe commissioner that they did not want him.\r\n\r\n"Let him stay at home," they said, "and sing his songs to those who\r\nwish to listen."\r\n\r\nBut the commissioner himself, and, I suspect, the commissioner\'s wife,\r\nwas as fond as any of Gven and his songs, so he said Gven was to come\r\nif he liked.\r\n\r\nPoor Gven tried hard enough to make us like him. He offered us the only\r\ngift he had, that of his songs, but no one cared to hear them except\r\nme, and I was ashamed to say so. In the end he was reduced to sitting\r\nfor hours, looking out into the night through which the ship bore us,\r\nsaying nothing to anyone, for fear of our scorn. He would have liked\r\nus to tell him about the Earth people, for his studies at the Palace\r\nfitted him sadly for a scientific expedition.\r\n\r\nOf the Earth people, however, we hesitated to speak freely, even among\r\nourselves, for all of us feel strongly about them, in one way or\r\nanother. Our exchanges on the matter have always been burdened with\r\nemotion; and we find we cannot share easily our thoughts about Earth\r\npeople, unless we banter lightly and say little of what we really feel.\r\n\r\nWhen our long-ship drew near the third Earth, we were transferred into\r\nthe round-ship in which we were to carry on our observations. I could\r\nsee Gven was limp with excitement, but as always, I would not exchange\r\nwith him for fear of the others, not even to drain off that excess of\r\nfeeling which was to prove so dangerous to him.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he thought it would be different, once we had established\r\nourselves in our designated area of observation. Then we might warm\r\ntoward him, giving him the comforts of our experience. If such were his\r\nexpectations, he was disappointed. Whatever he gathered from us was\r\npurely accidental, information that we exchanged among ourselves as we\r\nworked. Only in this way did he learn of those few bonds we had forged\r\nwith the Earth people.\r\n\r\nIt is our custom, as you know, for each man to select one of the Earth\r\npeople as his subject. This is not part of our work, it is only a\r\ndevice to drive away the tedium that descends upon men far from home\r\nand bound to exacting work in a confined place. We begin to feel quite\r\npassionately concerned with our subjects, and occasionally find it\r\ndifficult to return to our primary concerns.\r\n\r\nFor some time I had been spending my free hours in the world of a\r\ngentle old merchant named Jacobs. I lived his life with him briefly,\r\nseeing his wife and children as he saw them, going with him to his\r\nstore. His memories were good ones, filled with hard work and simple\r\npleasures. One day, when I had left the computing tables to prepare\r\nfor dinner, I sought the mind of Jacobs. He was crossing the street and\r\nas he turned his head, he saw the shining lights of an automobile just\r\nbefore it struck him. I withdrew from his mind in a shower of pain and\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\n"Oh, he is dead," my mind cried out to my vigil companions before\r\nI could smother the shock and emotion in it. They looked up at me,\r\nquestioning. Then I exchanged with them more coolly, "My man Jacobs has\r\nbeen killed crossing the street."\r\n\r\nKeven, the fuel technician, reached my mind first. "A pity, I lost a\r\nsubject myself that way not long ago. It is a bad death for them, poor\r\nthings. They might build overpasses, mightn\'t they? 

A pity."\r\n\r\nIt has never failed to unsettle me, the way my companions have come\r\nto accept the idea of death so easily. To me it is always a horror,\r\nunnatural and alien. You cannot quite see how it is, Novna, for you\r\nhave never been in the mind of one who dies.\r\n\r\nI withdrew for a little while to mourn my man Jacobs, for my sorrow was\r\nnot to be shared with the others. It was while I sat thinking of the\r\ndead Jacobs that Gven approached hesitantly and sat near me.\r\n\r\n"Is it possible," he asked, "that one can read the soul of an Earth\r\nman? Could I? 

Or perhaps that would not be permitted to me?"\r\n\r\nHis eagerness made me ashamed of the silence I had maintained between\r\nus. "It is certainly possible for you to try, though it cannot always\r\nbe done. You need ask no one for permission."\r\n\r\nThe delight in his eyes made me forget Jacobs a little. "I may try\r\nanyone at all?

"\r\n\r\n"I advise you to search about a little. Don\'t seize on the first one\r\nyou contact as a subject. 

You have less time than the rest of us for\r\nthis sort of thing."\r\n\r\nGven thanked me shyly and went away. Later I saw him sitting at the\r\nopen panels, looking down at the cloud-topped mountains and sandy\r\nvalleys over which we circled. His face was still and pale as he\r\nconcentrated.\r\n\r\nThe next day at dinner, Gven sat playing with his food, looking up\r\nat the rest of us frequently, as if his fear of our coldness were\r\ncontending with his wish to open his mind to us. I was not the only\r\none to notice his excitement, but the rest sat looking at their\r\nplates stonily. They liked Gven even less than they had at first, and\r\npreferred to ignore his presence altogether. At last I lifted my head\r\ndefiantly and my thought streamed across the table into the mind of\r\nGven with such energy and violence that the others raised their eyes\r\nfrom their food in quick surprise.\r\n\r\n"It must be that you have found a subject. I should like to hear about\r\nit.

"\r\n\r\nAt once Gven let his thoughts explode in undisciplined profusion. The\r\nmen drew back a little, shocked by the unfamiliar impact of another\'s\r\npassion on their minds.\r\n\r\n"The very first mind I sought was that of a girl who calls herself\r\nMaria Dolores. Often her mind turns in upon itself and she reflects\r\nlike this, \'Maria Dolores, you have behaved badly to your papa today.\r\nNow you must go and ask him to forgive you and give him a kiss.\' In\r\nthis way she scolds herself for small misdemeanors. Her world is\r\ncomposed of happy, innocent trivialities, though as her purity touches\r\non them and causes them to glow briefly before they are left behind, it\r\nseems that there are no more divine and lovely things in existence than\r\nthose in the world of my Maria Dolores."\r\n\r\nGven blushed and paused for a moment, then rushed on. "I sense that\r\nher father and mother have barricaded her from everyone else. They are\r\nstrict with Maria Dolores and sometimes she wishes she could go out to\r\ndances as the other girls do. But she is not sad for long, and goes\r\nto gather flowers for the dinner table. She sets them in long silver\r\ndishes, that reflect the pink and red glow of the sunset slanting\r\nthrough the window. This pleases Maria Dolores and she stands watching\r\nfor a long time."\r\n\r\nGven would have said more, but all at once Corven, the cultural\r\nresearcher, interrupted, looking at me. "Noven, what have you brought\r\nupon us by your curiosity? We are being buried in an avalanche of\r\npoetic fancies."\r\n\r\nAfter this, Gven sat silent, his face burning, and the rest of us began\r\nto talk of the relation between the sites of mines and the locations of\r\nproving grounds.\r\n\r\nFor many days, I watched Gven covertly. He no longer seemed to care\r\nabout our rebuffs, nor did he show any desire to ask us questions. He\r\nonly sat by the panels, his expression withdrawn and intent, while the\r\nrest of us hustled busily and a little self-consciously around him.\r\nI came to notice a certain perplexity in his face after a time, and\r\nfelt that I should ask if he needed any assistance. But I was awkward\r\nand unsure of myself, so I only watched him and said nothing. At last\r\nhe came to me, having built up a powerful reserve of feeling that\r\noverflowed with the more violence for having been repressed so long.\r\n\r\n"There is something that is to happen in the life of my Maria Dolores,"\r\nGven began directly.\r\n\r\nUnaccountably, I tensed and tried to suppress the warmth I felt toward\r\nhim. "Well, what is it then?" 

I answered.\r\n\r\nHe seemed not to notice the strain I was under. "They have told her she\r\nis to be married to a young man whom they have chosen for her. She is\r\nunhappy, but cannot tell them. Now they are making many preparations.\r\nMaria Dolores spends her time with her mother, sewing dresses and\r\npacking them away. Then her mother speaks to her of things that\r\nfrighten her and me, things that seem to happen when men and women are\r\nalone at night. She does not understand and lies awake when her mother\r\nhas gone, afraid and wondering. 

We are uneasy, Maria Dolores and I."\r\n\r\nHere, Novna, I must attempt to explain the marriage of Earth people.\r\nWhile with us marriage is the spiritualized union of masculine and\r\nfeminine natures in one soul, it is to them a more concrete thing.\r\nTheir junction is not only one of minds, but one of bodies as well.\r\n\r\nThe union seems not to be unpleasant for those who take part in it, but\r\nfor us, who so jealously guard our bodies from another\'s touch, the\r\nmarriage of Earth people is difficult to contemplate without revulsion.\r\n\r\nI was rescued from having to answer Gven by the laughter of Corven, who\r\nhad overheard the last of the poet\'s words. "Well then, poet, if she is\r\nunhappy, you must take her away, mustn\'t you? 

That\'s what you want, it\r\nseems, to take her away to Hainos and make her your Gvna."\r\n\r\nGven stood up and glared angrily at Corven. "Would it be so bad a thing\r\nto carry back one person of Earth? Why shouldn\'t we?" he flung at the\r\nother man.\r\n\r\nCorven turned away in disgust. "You know we have no authority to\r\nintervene in their affairs. This is what comes of letting a poet-priest\r\nmeddle in the concerns of science."\r\n\r\nA sullenness came over Gven\'s face, and he withdrew from us again,\r\nturning back to the panels. I knew he was with Maria Dolores. Though I\r\nwas uneasy over his ignorance, I could not help feeling relieved that I\r\nhad not been forced to enlighten him.\r\n\r\nMy anxiety proved to be well-founded. It was only a few weeks later\r\nthat we reaped the results of our long-cultivated conspiracy of\r\nsilence against the poet-priest. We were deeply engrossed in our work\r\nat the computing tables when our nerves were shattered by a cry of\r\nanguish from the mind of Gven. In a moment we were standing around\r\nhim, avoiding each other\'s eyes and scarcely daring to look at the man\r\nshuddering before us, his face in his hands.\r\n\r\n"It is done." Gven cast his anger at us like a stone. "It is as though\r\nshe had been killed. 

Why couldn\'t you tell me? You, Noven, I asked you.\r\nWhy couldn\'t you have spared me this?"\r\n\r\nThe men looked uneasily at me and back at Gven. Shaken, they drifted\r\naway, back to their work, still ashamed to meet each other\'s eyes. Gven\r\nsat there, grinding his fist into his palm, staring straight ahead.\r\n\r\nHe has been gone for some time now. At his request, a long-ship stopped\r\nfor him on its homeward cruise. I have not tried to reach another\r\nsubject, nor have any of the others. At least, if they have, they do\r\nnot speak of it. 

We are reluctant to attempt any communion with these\r\ncreatures whose alien nature has been so strikingly demonstrated to\r\nus. The game of Observation itself has become less a game, and we go\r\nabout our work with a vague sense of unrest, as though the descent of\r\ncatastrophe upon us were imminent.\r\n\r\nGven gave us one last gift before he left. He sang us a song that made\r\nus want to bend our heads to the ground in shame. If his songs are\r\nbitter now, and if there is no innocence in them, one needs not look\r\nfar to find the reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n

He came to my desk during the\r\nmidafternoon lull and said, "I am Professor Jonathan Waits. I have come\r\nto avail myself of your facilities."\r\n\r\nI had never heard it put quite that way before, but from Professor\r\nWaits, it did not sound stilted. It was the way you would expect him to\r\nput it. He beamed at the ceiling and said, "What a fine old library, my\r\ndear. I must bring Nicholas some time."\r\n\r\nI gave him the smile reserved financial supporters and unknown\r\nquantatives and asked, "Could I be of service?"\r\n\r\nHe didn\'t get to it immediately. "I understand this library is fairly\r\ncrammed with old records--data on the historical aspects of this area.\r\nPersonal histories and such."\r\n\r\nHe had a way of radiating his own cheerful mood. "Oh yes," I assured\r\nhim. "It\'s an exceptional day when we don\'t sweep a D.A.R. or two out\r\nof the aisles come closing time."\r\n\r\nThis, according to his laugh, was quite good. He said, "I\'m sure we\'ll\r\nget on splendidly, Miss--?"\r\n\r\n"--Hopstead."\r\n\r\n"Are you a native?"\r\n\r\n"A New Englander from way back," I assured him. "Some of my ancestors\r\nused to drink buttered rum with Captain Rogers."\r\n\r\n"Then possibly you\'d like to know about my work.

"\r\n\r\n"I certainly would." And, strangely enough, I did.\r\n\r\n"I am a researcher into the--well, the unusual."\r\n\r\n"Psychic research?" I inquired, wanting him to know we New Englanders\r\nwere not dullards.\r\n\r\n"No. Nothing to do with the supernatural at all. My work is to prove\r\nthat all occurrences, however mysterious, are the logical result of\r\nprevious actions of individuals; that superstitions are the result, not\r\nso much of ignorance, but lack of knowledge."\r\n\r\nWhile I wrestled with that one, he said, "Maybe I could be a trifle\r\nmore explicit.

"\r\n\r\n"That would help.

"\r\n\r\nHis bright little eyes got even brighter. "Do you know, by chance, of\r\nthe Reamer mansion over in Carleton?"\r\n\r\nI certainly did. It was some thirty miles from Patterson, but as a\r\nchild, I\'d visited the place. All children within the radius had\r\nvisited the Reamer mansion at least once. It was an ancient fifteen\r\nroom cockroach trap with such a history of death and violence behind it\r\nas to cause the kids to walk on tiptoe through its silent rooms. I told\r\nthe professor I knew about it.\r\n\r\n"It has been vacant for fifteen years," he observed.\r\n\r\n"And will be vacant for twice fifteen more, I imagine."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just the point. 

Superstition. Otherwise solid and sane people\r\nwouldn\'t dream of moving into the Reamer mansion. And it\'s so silly.

"\r\n\r\n"It is?"\r\n\r\n"Of course. And that\'s why I\'m here. I intend to prove, so the most\r\nstubborn will understand, that the house itself has nothing whatsoever\r\nto do with its own grim past; that the people who lived in it are to\r\nblame."\r\n\r\nIt was a dull day and he was such an apparently sincere little man that\r\nI decided to keep the conversation alive. "I\'m afraid you\'ll have a\r\nhard time proving it. Let\'s see--the first one was old Silas Reamer. He\r\ncommitted suicide there. That was sometime around 1925. Then--"\r\n\r\n"--His son, Henry Reamer, was found dead under mysterious circumstances\r\ntwo years later. Murder was obvious, but nothing has ever been done\r\nabout it."\r\n\r\nI frowned in mock severity. "I don\'t like the way you put that,\r\nProfessor. Do you imply that we New Englanders condone violence?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, not at all. 

There were just--no clues, from what I\'ve learned. The\r\nnext unfortunate, a renter named Miles McCormick, was found dead along\r\nwith his wife and child as a result of lethal gas from a faulty stove."\r\n\r\n"That happened the year I was born. 

We have the old newspapers here,\r\ntelling about it."\r\n\r\n"Those reports, along with other material are what I wish to study,"\r\nProfessor Waits said, then went on. "The house stood vacant for five\r\nyears, until a Johnathan Hays bought it."\r\n\r\n"But Johnathan Hays never moved in. He died of a heart attack while\r\ncarrying a chair through the front door."\r\n\r\nHe beamed on me. "You are a remarkably alert young woman; well up in\r\nlocal history."\r\n\r\n"With no credit to me. You\'d be hard put finding a citizen around here\r\nwho doesn\'t know the history of the Reamer mansion."\r\n\r\n"Not \'of the Reamer mansion\', my dear. Of the people who just happened\r\nto reap their ill-fortune there."\r\n\r\n"You insist the house had nothing to do with it?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing whatever."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Professor--I wonder if you know how big a bite you\'ve taken? If you\r\ngo up in the hills hereabouts you\'ll find whole families living in\r\ndirt-floor houses. You\'ll find children who never heard of a bath or a\r\ntelephone. But you won\'t find one person who would live in the Reamer\r\nmansion for a salary paid promptly every Saturday morning."\r\n\r\n"Nonetheless," Professor Waits replied, "the so-called jinx of the\r\nmansion, or any other maligned locality, is a matter of monstrous\r\ncoincidence. The truth lies hidden in the lives of the people involved.\r\nI\'ve been ferreting out that truth."\r\n\r\n"You mean this isn\'t a beginning, Professor?"\r\n\r\nHe grasped his umbrella in a manner indicating he meant to spear a\r\ndragon in case there were any around, and said, "Oh my no! I\'ve been\r\ntracing the lives of the principals in this drama for some time. 

It\r\ninvolves long, tedious work. I must not only dig into the lives of the\r\nunfortunates themselves, but also into those of kin; even--in some\r\ncases--friends."\r\n\r\n"What did you find out about the murder?"\r\n\r\nHe evaded neatly. "I am not seeking a killer as such. Relative to that\r\nfacet of the case, I am more interested in Henry Reamer himself. A very\r\nwise man once said, \'If you would understand violence, look also into\r\nthe heart of the murdered\'. A man carries the seeds of his destiny in\r\nhis own soul."\r\n\r\n"And you intend to prove it?"\r\n\r\n"I am finding more proof every day. Soon I shall publish a paper which\r\nwill startle the thinking world."\r\n\r\nI could see the Professor wasn\'t one to be backed into any corners.\r\n"And how can I help in this work?"\r\n\r\n"I am tracing at the moment, certain details in the life of Mabel\r\nTutworthy, an aunt of Silas Reamer. Unauthenticated legends indicate\r\nshe killed an eight-point buck once, with her bare hands, and dragged\r\nit home across ten miles of forest."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve heard that, and it\'s probably true. You think it has something to\r\ndo with what happened to Silas?"\r\n\r\n"--_And_ his son Henry."\r\n\r\n"I think you\'ll find what you want in that section by the south window.\r\nIt\'s devoted to local history."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, my dear." He moved away, reminding me somehow, of a happy\r\nretriever going into a lake after a duck. Halfway to the shelves, he\r\nhalted suddenly and turned. "Did you know that seventy percent of the\r\naccidents happen to twenty percent of the people?"\r\n\r\nI didn\'t, but I refused to admit such backwardness. "I certainly do.\r\nAmazing, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"That is one of the pillars upon which my work is based."\r\n\r\n"And there are others?"\r\n\r\n"Seven in all."\r\n\r\nHe didn\'t tell me what the other six were. Instead he disappeared into\r\nlocal history and left me with the latest best seller I was reading\r\nunder the counter lest some child come in and be stripped of all\r\ninnocence by one glance.\r\n\r\nIt was two hours before Professor Waits reappeared. He carried a small\r\nblue notebook in one hand and a stub pencil in the other. 

He was\r\npositively beaming. "A gold mine," he said. "A veritable gold mine. Did\r\nyou know that Ezekial Webb, a cousin of William Tutworthy was gored by\r\na bull in the year 1862?"\r\n\r\n"No--really?"\r\n\r\nThen I was truly ashamed of myself. 

He was such a pleasant, sincere\r\nlittle man and he got such fun out of life. But he misinterpreted\r\nmy boorishness for true enthusiasm and said, "It\'s a fact! Imagine!\r\nWalking in here and finding one of the links I\'ve hunted for months.\r\nI\'m indebted to you, my dear, for directing me to that book shelf."\r\n\r\nI could have told him he was under no obligation; that I got, each\r\nweek, the coolie stipend of twenty eight dollars for doing just that;\r\nbut I didn\'t want him starting an investigation into peonage system\r\npracticed in libraries and schools.\r\n\r\nThen something in the little man\'s manner, sobered me.\r\n"Professor--exactly why are you doing this?"\r\n\r\nHe blinked. 

"I have plenty of money. I have the time. It interests me.\r\nAnd I feel it a worthy occupation; gathering knowledge through which\r\npeople may know the true causes of misfortune; may throw off the yoke\r\nof superstition."\r\n\r\n"You feel, then, that nothing happens by chance?"\r\n\r\n"My dear," he said, solemnly, "in this ordered universe there can be\r\nno such thing. Action and achievement--cause and result. The revealing\r\npattern of each man\'s actions is in the pasts of himself and his\r\nantecedents."\r\n\r\n"And by proving this you will exonerate the Reamer mansion of all\r\nguilt?"\r\n\r\nHe smiled. "You are a most intelligent young lady. Most intelligent! I\r\nshall see a great deal of you in the weeks to come."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was not a distasteful prospect. I liked the Professor and was glad\r\nhe liked me. After he left I went back and found not a single book out\r\nof place. I liked him even more.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks passed before I saw Professor Waits again. He came in out of\r\nthe sunshine, carrying his black umbrella and wearing the same black\r\nstring necktie. I was busy at the time, finding an acceptable book for\r\nMrs. 

Winsolow\'s little Freddie who was in bed with the pip. When I got\r\nclear, Professor Waits was deep in his research and I did not disturb\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe came pattering out just before closing time and I was struck by the\r\nsomber--almost sad--expression he wore.\r\n\r\n"Did you have trouble finding what you wanted, Professor?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no. 

The records are most voluminous. It\'s just--well, the _nature_\r\nof my discoveries."\r\n\r\n"Bad?"\r\n\r\n"Very bad, Miss Hopstead. Do you know who Henry Reamer\'s murderer was?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Miles McCormick, the renter who died there so tragically with his\r\nfamily."\r\n\r\nI didn\'t quite know how to respond; whether I should faint or scream\r\nfor the police. I settled for a philosophical comment. "A case of\r\njustice by a higher power."\r\n\r\n"You mean McCormick\'s death?"\r\n\r\n"Of course."\r\n\r\n"On the contrary. There was no connection at all between the two\r\nevents. McCormick and his wife and child died because they violated a\r\ncertain law, but not necessarily a law on the statute books."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid I don\'t quite follow that.

"\r\n\r\n"Look at it this way, Miss Hopstead. You are walking through a dark\r\nroom. A door is standing open. You come into violent contact with the\r\nedge of it. What happens?"\r\n\r\n"A broken nose? A black eye."\r\n\r\n"Precisely. The fact you didn\'t know the door was there didn\'t protect\r\nyou from the consequences."\r\n\r\nThis of course, I was forced to concede.\r\n\r\n"Now let\'s go a step further by taking, as example, a lower mentality\r\nthan our own. A horse, knowing nothing of the laws of electricity,\r\nwould step on a high voltage wire and never know why it was\r\nelectrocuted. In such a case, the animal would violate a law it did not\r\nknow existed."\r\n\r\nI was beginning to see what he was driving at. "You mean--"\r\n\r\n"We are far above the horse in mentality and understanding but\r\nthere are still many laws we do not understand. That is what my work\r\ninvolves."\r\n\r\nI insisted upon being heard. "You mean a lot of apparently innocent\r\nthings we do are really electric wires."\r\n\r\nHe beamed. "Exactly. When we reap misfortune it is because we violate\r\nsome law. Ignorance of that law doesn\'t change the end-result one iota."\r\n\r\n"And you\'re trying to find out what these--these booby traps are?"\r\n\r\n"Oh I know many of them already. My paper will surprise the world.\r\nI\'m working on a more advanced phase of the problem now. I am tracing\r\na pattern of interlocking violations to show that the scene of the\r\nend-results can be only sheerest coincidence. I want to banish once\r\nand for all the superstition-stigma attached to scenes of repeated\r\nmisfortune and violence."\r\n\r\n"The Reamer mansion."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right. And now I must be going, Miss Hopstead." He gave me the\r\ndeparting smile and started for the door.\r\n\r\n"Professor Waits."\r\n\r\n"Yes?"\r\n\r\n"About Mabel Tutworthy. Did she really drag that buck ten miles."\r\n\r\n"No. It was only a fawn. And she killed it less than a mile from her\r\ncabin."\r\n\r\n"And the murder of Henry Reamer. What proof--?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing the police would be interested in. It was the end-result of\r\na cause they won\'t understand until my work is published and given\r\nstudy."\r\n\r\nHe opened the door, looked around, smiled. "This is certainly a fine\r\nold building. I _must_ bring Nicholas with me the next time."\r\n\r\nWith that, he was gone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI found myself looking forward to his next visit. I looked and looked\r\nand a month passed and a tall, serious-faced youth came into the\r\nlibrary and waited until I\'d finished checking in Mrs. Garvey\'s returns.\r\n\r\n"I understand," he said, "that you have an immense store of local\r\nhistory in this library?"\r\n\r\n"The section by the south window."\r\n\r\n"Thank you." He peered at me through thick lenses. "Thank you Miss--"\r\n\r\n"--Hopstead."\r\n\r\n"Miss Hopstead. I am Nicholas Worthy. Possibly you knew a friend of\r\nmine. Professor Waits? I am carrying on his work."\r\n\r\n"Carrying on--? Did something happen to--?"\r\n\r\n"Oh. Then you didn\'t hear. It was most tragic. Professor Waits died of\r\npneumonia. A great loss--a great loss."\r\n\r\nI was deeply shocked. My feeling was that of losing a close friend.\r\n"No, I hadn\'t heard. It must have been very sudden.

"\r\n\r\n"It was. He was advanced in years, you know, and after he fell,\r\npneumonia set in quickly. They were unable to save him."\r\n\r\n"The Professor had an accident?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. He fell down the main staircase of the Reamer mansion and broke\r\nhis hip."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


He couldn\'t read a map. He didn\'t know what a map was. He\r\nonly grinned when they told him that North was at the top.\r\n\r\nHe knew better.\r\n\r\nBut he did write a nice round hand, like a boy\'s hand. He knew Spanish,\r\nand enough English. For the sector that was assigned to him he would not\r\nneed a map. He knew it better than anyone else, certainly better than\r\nany mapmaker. Besides, he was poor and needed the money.\r\n\r\nThey instructed him and sent him out. Or they thought that they had\r\ninstructed him. They couldn\'t be sure.\r\n\r\n"Count everyone? All right. Fill in everyone? I need more papers."\r\n\r\n"We will give you more if you need more. But there aren\'t so many in\r\nyour sector."\r\n\r\n"Lots of them. _Lobos_, _tejones_, _zorros_, even people."\r\n\r\n"Only the _people_, Manuel! Do not take the animals. How would you write\r\nup the animals? They have no names."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. All have names. Might as well take them all."\r\n\r\n"Only people, Manuel."\r\n\r\n"_Mulos?_"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"_Conejos?_"\r\n\r\n"No, Manuel, no. Only the people."\r\n\r\n"No trouble. Might as well take them all."\r\n\r\n"Only people--God give me strength!--only people, Manuel."\r\n\r\n"How about little people?"\r\n\r\n"Children, yes. That has been explained to you."\r\n\r\n"_Little_ people. Not children, little people."\r\n\r\n"If they are people, take them."\r\n\r\n"How big they have to be?"\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t make any difference how big they are. If they are people,\r\ntake them."\r\n\r\nThat is where the damage was done.\r\n\r\nThe official had given a snap judgement, and it led to disaster. It was\r\nnot his fault. 

The instructions are not clear. Nowhere in all the\r\nverbiage does it say how big they have to be to be counted as people.\r\n\r\n\r\nManuel took Mula and went to work. His sector was the Santa Magdalena, a\r\nscrap of bald-headed and desolate mountains, steep but not high, and so\r\ntorrid in the afternoons that it was said that the old lava sometimes\r\nbegan to writhe and flow again from the sun\'s heat alone.\r\n\r\nIn the center valley there were five thousand acres of slag and\r\nvitrified rock from some forgotten old blast that had melted the hills\r\nand destroyed their mantle, reducing all to a terrible flatness. This\r\nwas called Sodom. It was strewn with low-lying ghosts as of people and\r\nobjects, formed when the granite bubbled like water.\r\n\r\nAway from the dead center the ravines were body-deep in chaparral, and\r\nthe hillsides stood gray-green with old cactus. The stunted trees were\r\nlower than the giant bushes and yucca.\r\n\r\nManuel went with Mula, a round easy man and a sparse gaunt mule. Mula\r\nwas a mule, but there were other inhabitants of the Santa Magdalena of a\r\ngenus less certain.\r\n\r\nYet even about Mula there was an oddity in her ancestry. Her paternal\r\ngrandfather had been a goat. Manuel once told Mr. Marshal about this,\r\nbut Mr. Marshal had not accepted it.\r\n\r\n"She is a mule. Therefore, her father was a jack. Therefore his father\r\nwas also a jack, a donkey. It could not be any other way."\r\n\r\nManuel often wondered about that, for he had raised the whole strain of\r\nanimals, and he remembered who had been with whom.\r\n\r\n"A donkey! A jack! Two feet tall and with a beard and horns. I always\r\nthought that he was a goat."\r\n\r\nManuel and Mula stopped at noon on Lost Soul Creek. There would be no\r\ntravel in the hot afternoon. But Manuel had a job to do, and he did it.\r\nHe took the forms from one of the packs that he had unslung from Mula,\r\nand counted out nine of them. He wrote down all the data on nine people.\r\nHe knew all there was to know about them, their nativities and their\r\nantecedents. He knew that there were only nine regular people in the\r\nnine hundred square miles of the Santa Magdalena.\r\n\r\nBut he was systematic, so he checked the list over again and again.\r\nThere seemed to be somebody missing. Oh, yes, himself. He got another\r\nform and filled out all the data on himself.\r\n\r\nNow, in one way of looking at it, his part in the census was finished.\r\nIf only he had looked at it that way, he would have saved worry and\r\ntrouble for everyone, and also ten thousand lives. But the instructions\r\nthey had given him were ambiguous, for all that they had tried to make\r\nthem clear.\r\n\r\nSo very early the next morning he rose and cooked beans, and said,\r\n"Might as well take them all."\r\n\r\nHe called Mula from the thorn patch where she was grazing, gave her salt\r\nand loaded her again. Then they went to take the rest of the census, but\r\nin fear. There was a clear duty to get the job done, but there was also\r\na dread of it that his superiors did not understand. There was reason\r\nalso why Mula was loaded so she could hardly walk with packs of census\r\nforms.\r\n\r\nManuel prayed out loud as they climbed the purgatorial scarp above Lost\r\nSouls Creek, "_ruega por nosotros pecadores ahora_--" the very gulches\r\nstood angry and stark in the early morning--"_y en la hora de neustra\r\nmuerte._"\r\n\r\n\r\nThree days later an incredible dwarf staggered into the outskirts of\r\nHigh Plains, Texas, followed by a dying wolf-sized animal that did not\r\nlook like a wolf.\r\n\r\nA lady called the police to save the pair from rock-throwing kids who\r\nmight have killed them, and the two as yet unclassified things were\r\ntaken to the station house.\r\n\r\nThe dwarf was three foot high, a skeleton stretched over with\r\nbrown-burnt leather. The other was an un-canine looking dog-sized beast,\r\nso full of burrs and thorns that it might have been a porcupine. It was\r\na nightmare replica of a shrunken mule.\r\n\r\nThe midget was mad. The animal had more presence of mind: she lay down\r\nquietly and died, which was the best she could do, considering the state\r\nthat she was in.\r\n\r\n"Who is census chief now?" asked the mad midget. "Is Mr. Marshal\'s boy\r\nthe census chief?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Marshal is, yes. Who are you? How do you know Marshal? And what is\r\nthat which you are pulling out of your pants, if they are pants?"\r\n\r\n"Census list. Names of everybody in the Santa Magdalena. I had to steal\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"It looks like microfilm, the writing is so small. And the roll goes on\r\nand on. There must be a million names here."\r\n\r\n"Little bit more, little bit more. I get two bits a name."\r\n\r\nThey got Marshal there. He was very busy, but he came. He had been given\r\na deadline by the mayor and the citizen\'s group. He had to produce a\r\npopulation of ten thousand people for High Plains, Texas; and this was\r\ndifficult, for there weren\'t that many people in the town. He had been\r\nworking hard on it, though; but he came when the police called him.\r\n\r\n"You Marshal\'s little boy? You look just like your father," said the\r\nmidget.\r\n\r\n"That voice, I should know that voice even if it\'s cracked to pieces.\r\nThat has to be Manuel\'s voice."\r\n\r\n"Sure, I\'m Manuel. Just like I left, thirty-five years ago."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t be Manuel, shrunk three feet and two hundred pounds and aged\r\na million."\r\n\r\n"You look here at my census slip. It says I\'m Manuel. And here are nine\r\nmore of the regular people, and one million of the little people. I\r\ncouldn\'t get them on the right forms, though. 

I had to steal their\r\nlist."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t be Manuel," said Marshal.\r\n\r\n"He can\'t be Manuel," said the big policemen and the little policeman.\r\n\r\n"Maybe not, then," the dwarf conceded. "I thought I was, but I wasn\'t\r\nsure. 

Who am I then? Let\'s look at the other papers and see which one I\r\nam."\r\n\r\n"No, you can\'t be any of them either, Manuel. And you surely can\'t be\r\nManuel."\r\n\r\n"Give him a name anyhow and get him counted. We got to get to that ten\r\nthousand mark."\r\n\r\n"Tell us what happened, Manuel--if you are. Which you aren\'t. But tell\r\nus."\r\n\r\n"After I counted the regular people I went to count the little people. I\r\ntook a spade and spaded off the top of their town to get in. But they\r\nput an _encanto_ on me, and made me and Mula run a treadmill for\r\nthirty-five years."\r\n\r\n"Where was this?

"\r\n\r\n"At the little people town. Nuevo Danae. But after thirty-five years the\r\n_encanto_ wore off and Mula and I stole the list of names and ran away."\r\n\r\n"But where did you really get this list of so many names written so\r\nsmall?"\r\n\r\n"Suffering saddle sores, Marshal, don\'t ask the little bug so many\r\nquestions. You got a million names in your hand. 

Certify them! Send them\r\nin! There\'s enough of us here right now. We declare that place annexed\r\nforthwith. This will make High Plains the biggest town in the whole\r\nstate of Texas."\r\n\r\n\r\nSo Marshal certified them and sent them into Washington. This gave High\r\nPlains the largest percentage increase of any city in the nation, but it\r\nwas challenged. There were some soreheads in Houston who said that it\r\nwasn\'t possible. They said High Plains had nowhere near that many people\r\nand there must have been a miscount.\r\n\r\nAnd in the days that the argument was going on, they cleaned up and fed\r\nManuel, if it were he, and tried to get from him a cogent story.\r\n\r\n"How do you know it was thirty-five years you were on the treadmill,\r\nManuel?"\r\n\r\n"Well, it seemed like thirty-five years.

"\r\n\r\n"It could have only been about three days."\r\n\r\n"Then how come I\'m so old?"\r\n\r\n"We don\'t know that, Manuel, we sure don\'t know that. How big were these\r\npeople?"\r\n\r\n"Who knows? A finger long, maybe two?"\r\n\r\n"And what is their town?"\r\n\r\n"It is an old prairie-dog town that they fixed up. You have to dig down\r\nwith a spade to get to the streets."\r\n\r\n"Maybe they were really all prairie dogs, Manuel. Maybe the heat got you\r\nand you only dreamed that they were little people."\r\n\r\n"Prairie dogs can\'t write as good as on that list. Prairie dogs can\'t\r\nwrite hardly at all."\r\n\r\n"That\'s true. 

The list is hard to explain. And such odd names on it\r\ntoo."\r\n\r\n"Where is Mula? I don\'t see Mula since I came back."\r\n\r\n"Mula just lay down and died, Manuel."\r\n\r\n"Gave me the slip. Why didn\'t I think of that? 

Well, I\'ll do it too. I\'m\r\ntoo worn out for anything else."\r\n\r\n"Before you do, Manuel, just a couple of last questions."\r\n\r\n"Make them real fast then. I\'m on my way."\r\n\r\n"Did you know these little people were there before?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, sure. There a long time."\r\n\r\n"Did anybody else ever see them?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, sure. Everybody in the Santa Magdalena see them. Eight, nine people\r\nsee them."\r\n\r\n"And Manuel, how do we get to the place? 

Can you show us on a map?"\r\n\r\nManuel made a grimace, and died quietly as Mula had done. He didn\'t\r\nunderstand those maps at all, and took the easy way out.\r\n\r\nThey buried him, not knowing for sure whether he was Manuel come back,\r\nor what he was.\r\n\r\nThere wasn\'t much of him to bury.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the same night, very late and after he had been asleep, that\r\nMarshal was awakened by the ring of an authoritative voice. He was being\r\nharangued by a four-inch tall man on his bedside table, a man of\r\ndominating presence and acid voice.\r\n\r\n"Come out of that cot, you clown! Give me your name and station!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m Marshal, and I suspect that you are a late pig sandwich, or caused\r\nby one. I shouldn\'t eat so late."\r\n\r\n"Say \'sir\' when you reply to me. I am no pig sandwich and I do not\r\ncommonly call on fools. 

Get on your feet, you clod."\r\n\r\nAnd wonderingly Marshal did.\r\n\r\n"I want the list that was stolen. Don\'t gape! 

Get it!"\r\n\r\n"What list?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t stall, don\'t stutter. Get me our tax list that was stolen. It\r\nisn\'t words that I want from you.

"\r\n\r\n"Listen, you cicada, I\'ll take you and--"\r\n\r\n"You will not. You will notice that you are paralyzed from the neck\r\ndown. I suspect that you were always so from there up. 

Where is the\r\nlist?"\r\n\r\n"S-sent it to Washington."\r\n\r\n"You bug-eyed behemoth! Do you realize what a trip that will be? You\r\ngrandfather of inanities, it will be a pleasure to destroy you!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what you are, or if you are really. I don\'t believe that\r\nyou even belong on the world."\r\n\r\n"Not belong on the world! We own the world. We can show written title to\r\nthe world. Can you?"\r\n\r\n"I doubt it. Where did you get the title?"\r\n\r\n"None of your business. I\'d rather not say. Oh, well, we got it from a\r\npromoter of sorts. A con man, really. I\'ll have to admit that we were\r\ntaken, but we were in a spot and needed a world. He said that the larger\r\nbifurcates were too stupid to be a nuisance. We should have known that\r\nthe stupider a creature, the more of a nuisance it is."\r\n\r\n"I had about decided the same thing about the smaller a creature. We may\r\nhave to fumigate that old mountain mess."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you can\'t harm us. We\'re too powerful. But we can obliterate you in\r\nan instant."\r\n\r\n"Hah!"\r\n\r\n"Say \'Hah, _sir_\' when you address me. Do you know the place in the\r\nmountain that is called Sodom?"\r\n\r\n"I know the place. It was caused by a large meteor."\r\n\r\n"It was caused by one of these."\r\n\r\nWhat he held up was the size of a grain of sand. Marshal could not see\r\nit in detail.\r\n\r\n"There was another city of you bug-eyed beasts there," said the small\r\nmartinet. "You wouldn\'t know about it. 

It\'s been a few hundred years. We\r\ndecided it was too close. Now I have decided that you are too close."\r\n\r\n"A thing that size couldn\'t crack a walnut."\r\n\r\n"You floundering fop, it will blast this town flat!"\r\n\r\n"What will happen to you?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing. I don\'t even blink for things like that."\r\n\r\n"How do you trigger it off."\r\n\r\n"You gaping goof, I don\'t have time to explain that to you. 

I have to\r\nget to Washington."\r\n\r\nIt may be that Marshal did not believe himself quite awake. He certainly\r\ndid not take the threat seriously enough. For the little man did trigger\r\nit off.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the final count was in, High Plains did not have the highest\r\npercentage gain in population in the nation. Actually it showed the\r\nsharpest decline, from 7313 to nothing.\r\n\r\nThey were going to make a forest preserve out of the place, except that\r\nit has no trees worthy of the name. Now it is proposed to make it the\r\nSodom and Gomorrah State Park from the two mysterious scenes of\r\ndesolation there, just seven miles apart.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting place, as wild a region as you will ever find, and\r\nis recommended for the man who has seen everything.\r\n\r\n\r\n  --R.

]\r\n\r\n\r\nGoro put down his tools and relaxed into a pile of wood shavings, his\r\nback against a half-finished bathtub. To enjoy the evening cool, he\r\ntold himself, wiping his face with a blue and white rag. Actually,\r\nhe wanted to postpone the evening meal. Either the rice would be\r\novercooked to a sticky goo or he would be picking hard, underdone\r\nkernels out of his teeth all night. And bean soup, when he made it,\r\nalways had things swimming in it that had no business there.\r\n\r\nA night insect went _weep-weep-weep_. The sound, the night\r\nfalling, and the thought of his own cooking made him think of his dead\r\nwife.\r\n\r\n"She was a good cook, poor thing," he thought out loud. "My, my--how I\r\nmiss her."\r\n\r\nHe gave a deep sigh. Oh, to have a wife again--a jolly, round wife and\r\na good cook. Just like the old one with perhaps the small exception\r\nthat she would not eat a man out of house and home and herself into\r\nthe grave in the bargain. Had he said that aloud? Bad sign, when a man\r\ntalks to the night insects--better to go into the house, better to eat\r\nrice and bean soup. He shuddered.\r\n\r\nHe began to get up and paused halfway, one hand against the wood of the\r\ntub, the other shielding his eyes. He peered into the forest that came\r\nalmost to the work yard. Someone was coming through there, he heard it.\r\nHe sat down again. Fireflies flitted among the trees. What if it were\r\nhis wife\'s spirit--would it be a chubby ghost? It should be.\r\n\r\nA woman walked out of the forest.\r\n\r\nShe was tall, he noticed, watching her thread her way among finished\r\nand unfinished buckets and tubs, tall and slender--almost gaunt. She\r\nhad her sleeves tied back out of the way with a white _tasuki_\r\ncord, as though ready for hard work, and her bare arms were wiry and\r\ncapable looking.\r\n\r\nShe bowed.\r\n\r\nGoro scrambled to his feet, catching a splinter or two in his shoulder\r\non the way up. He bowed.\r\n\r\n"Good evening," said the woman. "Is this the house of Goro, the cooper\r\nwho wants a wife that does not eat too much and is a good cook?"\r\n\r\nGoro\'s eyes crossed and his mouth fell open. His fingers scrabbled.\r\n\r\n"You _do_ look unwell ... like a starved goldfish," said the\r\nwoman, "--I don\'t mean to seem rude."\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t had dinner ..." said Goro, for want of anything brilliant to\r\nsay. He felt wondrously helpless; things like this did not usually come\r\nup in the tub-making business.\r\n\r\n"Naturally, poor thing. I\'m sure you can\'t cook well, either," said\r\nthe woman and Goro marvelled how ever she had guessed it. "Well, I can\r\ncook. I can do the work of three women. Into the house with you now,\r\nbefore you catch cold. 

Shoo!"\r\n\r\nShe drove him ahead of her into the house.\r\n\r\n"I would say I\'m quite charming," she said, closing the door behind\r\nthem, "when one gets used to me. As for my name, why, \'wife\', I think,\r\nwill do nicely."\r\n\r\nAnd sometime in the next few days still with the feeling that he was\r\nbeing left out of things, Goro found himself married.\r\n\r\nThe new wife was an excellent cook and indeed did the work of three\r\nordinary women. Dinner was never late, and the house was generally\r\nspotless. 

She spoke neither too much nor too little. On evenings when\r\nGoro came home discouraged, she always had some good remark ready\r\nabout the tub-making business--how much artistry and labor went into\r\na good bucket, how unreasonably little money went to the hard-working\r\nartist--cheering things, flattering things. Goro gained weight and was\r\nnot unhappy. At mealtimes his wife ate a little more than a bird but\r\nnot quite so much as a large cat.\r\n\r\nThe food bills went up and up.\r\n\r\nGoro gradually discovered that with the little eating going on, he was\r\nusing up food at a rate to feed six or seven coopers together with a\r\nfew aunts and uncles.\r\n\r\n"Curious ...," he muttered, "... very," and determined to investigate.\r\n\r\nOne morning he made a great fuss about getting measuring equipment\r\ntogether. He told his wife that he was going to a village half a day\'s\r\nwalk away, to take measurements for the village head-man\'s new tub.\r\nThen he went a short distance into the forest and waited behind a tree.\r\n\r\nWhen he saw his wife go to a nearby meadow to gather mushrooms, he\r\nflitted around to the back of the house. Hiding his tools behind\r\nthe rear door, he crept inside. He shinnied up the center pole and\r\nflattened out against one of the big ceiling beams. And waited.\r\n\r\nHis wife came back and put on the fire the largest pot in the house.\r\nFrom the storage bins she took about five pounds of rice and fell to\r\nwashing it. She ladled out enough bean paste to nearly fill another big\r\npot, and made bean soup.\r\n\r\n"Who," wondered Goro on his beam, "is she expecting, and how many of\r\nthem?" He blinked, blinked again--his eyes rather rolled up.\r\n\r\nShe had slid the kitchen door out of its frame and was using it for\r\na dumpling factory, lining the dumplings up--lines and lines of rice\r\ndumplings like fat well-paid soldiers.\r\n\r\nThen she stretched and peered about as if to make sure she had not\r\nforgotten something. Satisfied that she had not, she parted her hair\r\nand exposed the mouth in the center of her head.\r\n\r\nGoro made a circle of his thumbs and forefingers, trying to calculate\r\nthe size of the thing and nearly fell off his perch. It was fairly\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\nInto this crater, his wife pushed dumplings by ones and twos and they\r\ndisappeared. To make certain, she washed them down with all the bean\r\nsoup, ladles of bean soup.\r\n\r\nWhen she had disposed of everything she waited a moment, expectantly. A\r\ncheery, satisfied rumble came from the top of her head.\r\n\r\n"Burps, too," thought Goro. "A regular volcano. 

Wonder if there\'ll be\r\nsmoke." 

He was too interested to be frightened.\r\n\r\nBut nothing further happened. She bound her hair back neatly, smiled,\r\nand left the house on some errand like any good, wifely wife.\r\n\r\nGoro slipped down and out of the house, picking up his tools on the\r\nway. He went back into the forest, found a comfortable tree and sat\r\ndown against its trunk to smoke his tiny pipe and think.\r\n\r\n"I must have married one of the monsters the priests and old men talk\r\nabout, a yamam\'ba. A \'mountain-mother\'. Hmm," he nodded, bit his lip,\r\nand squinted his eyes.\r\n\r\n"Now why do you suppose they call them that?" he asked a squirrel that\r\nsat upright near his left foot, like an attentive, furry little doctor.\r\n"They come from the mountains--fine. But what\'s motherly about them, I\r\ndo not understand.\r\n\r\n"Squeerp!" said the squirrel, and ran halfway up the tree. From there\r\nit peered down and examined Goro\'s head.\r\n\r\nHe tilted his head back so that the squirrel could get a better look\r\nand told it that, at any rate, this was no kind of wife for a good man.\r\n\r\nThen he stood up and began to walk home, looking down at the ground,\r\nkicking thoughtfully at fallen leaves and occasionally scratching his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nHe came out from among the trees and across the yard of his home,\r\ndragging his feet like a man who has walked a long way.\r\n\r\nHe started speaking as soon as he put down his tools.\r\n\r\n"Wife, I have been thinking about our marriage and--it hurts me to\r\nsay it, you understand--but it was too sudden. No--don\'t interrupt,"\r\nhe said, though his wife had shown no sign of breaking in. 

"I\'m very\r\nsorry, but I feel that we\'re simply not suited to each other."\r\n\r\n"All right, husband, I\'ll leave," she answered in quite an ordinary\r\nvoice, "even if it makes me unhappy. Could you do only one thing for me\r\nbefore I go? Nothing much--I\'d like you to make me a tub--as a kind of\r\nsouvenir. A very large one. 

For bathing in."\r\n\r\n"The simplest thing in the world," said Goro, glad to get off so\r\neasily. "I have one ready, it happens. The very one I was sitting\r\nagainst when you came out of the forest. A very sound tub, one of my\r\nbest."\r\n\r\n"It has a lid, I hope," she said.\r\n\r\n"All of my tubs have lids," said Goro. "Well-fitting lids. Water stays\r\nwarm in _my_ tubs, even without a fire, once that lid is on. Come,\r\nI\'ll show it to you."\r\n\r\nHe led her out to the tub.\r\n\r\n"See? There\'s the lid, right up against it," he said, thumping the tub\r\nwith his fist. "Feel that wood! Isn\'t it a beauty?"\r\n\r\nShe looked into the tub and agreed that it was getting harder and\r\nharder to find real quality in tubs. "Too bad there\'s that large hole\r\nin it," she said.\r\n\r\n"Hole?" said Goro. "Hole? A hole in one of my tubs? Impossible ...\r\nwhere\'s that hole!"\r\n\r\nHe put his hands on the edge to raise himself and peered over.\r\n\r\n"There. Bottom right," she said. "Can\'t you see it?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, the bottom ..." said Goro, leaning further over the edge. "It\'s\r\ntoo dark to--"\r\n\r\nShe seized Goro\'s trousers in a firm grip and heaved.\r\n\r\n"--see," he finished, at the bottom of the tub. He was still wondering\r\nhow he had gotten down there when the lid came down, bang, and it grew\r\nvery dark. He felt the tub sail up, come to rest on something and begin\r\nto move forward with an up and down rocking movement.\r\n\r\nIt did not take Goro long, in his bucket-shaped night, to realize that\r\nthe yamam\'ba, having no further reason to pretend a feminine weakness\r\nshe probably despised anyway, had placed the tub on her head and was on\r\nher way home. To the mountain.\r\n\r\n"Excuse me," he called out. 

"Where are we going?"\r\n\r\n"To dinner," came his former wife\'s voice through the wood. It grated\r\nunpleasantly. He decided to ask no more questions.\r\n\r\nDeep into the woods went the yamam\'ba, cutting through thicket and\r\nunderbrush, the tub jouncing easily on her head, up and up into the\r\nmountains. Tireless on her long, rangy legs, she travelled along\r\ndead, forgotten roads lined with gnarled ugly trees. Goro heard their\r\nbranches, bump-crack-bump, against his self-made prison. 

A thin edge\r\nof lesser darkness began to show at the top. He hoped it was the first\r\ntime the lid had slipped on a tub made by Goro; this sort of thing\r\ncould ruin years of reputation. But it might mean a way out of the tub.\r\n\r\nThe opening grew wider. Looking up, he was able to see a few stars. Did\r\nhe imagine it, or was the tub slowing down? He hoped he was not going\r\nto be eaten immediately.\r\n\r\nThe tub stopped and settled.\r\n\r\nSomething rough, twisted, and snakelike appeared in the opening. It did\r\nnot move. 

Nothing moved. He put out his hand--it was a branch.\r\n\r\nHe gave the branch a delicate jiggle; it felt solid. The yamam\'ba, he\r\nguessed, must have tired and sat down to rest against a tree. Very\r\ncautiously he lifted himself by the branch, trying to move neither the\r\nlid nor the tub which must still be resting on the monster\'s head.\r\n\r\nHe heard a faint snore. Top or forward mouth, he wondered. He pulled\r\nhimself to his feet, trying not to breathe and at last stood with his\r\nhead out of the tub. The branch was thick, and the next branch, right\r\nabove, looked dependable. Healthy wood; he appreciated that. Then came\r\na few feet of bark--that would be hard climbing--but above that, four\r\nor five branches, almost a ladder. Further, it was too dark to see.\r\n\r\nHe tensed, took a deep breath, then gave a push and sent the heavy lid\r\ncrashing down on the sleeping yamam\'ba. Up she leaped, and the tub\r\nwent flying, but Goro was already climbing from branch to branch. In a\r\nnearby tree some monkeys woke up and watched Goro\'s footwork with shame\r\nand envy.\r\n\r\nFrom the ground the yamam\'ba stared up at him. It was a rare chance to\r\nsee just what a yamam\'ba really wore for a face, and he decided it was\r\nnot very attractive.\r\n\r\nDown below, the monster was letting down her horrible hair in a\r\nbusinesslike manner.\r\n\r\n"Dinner will be early," she said with a ghastly, girlish laugh. "I was\r\ngetting quite hungry."\r\n\r\nShe started up the tree, the top mouth opening and closing. There were\r\nteeth in it.\r\n\r\n"We yamam\'ba are very good with trees," she said, climbing steadily.\r\n"Don\'t climb any higher. It will only make you tired and sweaty and\r\nbitter to the taste. 

Say prayers instead and become calm and delicious."\r\n\r\n"I hope I burn your tongue if you have one in there," said Goro, a\r\nlittle beside himself. "And try not to be such a chatterbox. You\'re\r\nmaking my head buzz."\r\n\r\nHe _did_ hear a distinct buzzing, a small roaring right by his\r\nhead where he was holding on to a thin branch. He tried to move his\r\nhand away from the sound. Something small sat down on his thumb and set\r\nit on fire.\r\n\r\n"Ya-yowch!" he said, loudly.\r\n\r\n"Tee-hee-hee!" went the yamam\'ba, coming up with an intimate rustling\r\nof leaves.\r\n\r\nGoro sucked his thumb which had swollen surprisingly and stared at the\r\nball-like thing hanging only an arm\'s length away. The buzzing came\r\nfrom it. Very carefully he reached out to see if he would be able to\r\ngrab it instantly. He thought the size would be about right.\r\n\r\nA hard, scaly hand with claws came groping through the branches. He\r\nmoved his foot out of the way and waited for the head. It appeared, the\r\ntop mouth gaping.\r\n\r\n"Tee-hee-hee," said the yamam\'ba, using both mouths.\r\n\r\n"Tee-hee-hee yourself," said Goro. "Have a goody." And into the top of\r\nher head he dropped the buzzing ball.\r\n\r\n"Whatever it was, it had a bad taste and your blood will wash it away,"\r\nsaid the yamam\'ba but just then the hornets woke up, highly irritated\r\nfrom lack of sleep.\r\n\r\nThey flew \'round and \'round inside the yamam\'ba. A few of them tickled.\r\nMost of them stung. And all of them together worked a havoc in the\r\ndelicate equipment that makes up the yamam\'ba interior.\r\n\r\nThe yamam\'ba made a noise like a frying and a noise like a boiling,\r\nand a noise like nameless things running through the night with their\r\nears on fire. She tumbled from the tree, into the tub waiting below\r\nand bounced about inside it making unpleasant sounds too numerous to\r\nmention.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGoro followed, but more slowly. He arrived in time to see the tub\r\nskipping and hopping at the edge of the road which at that point\r\nwas quite narrow. It teetered for a moment and then sailed out in a\r\ngracious curve, trailing its uproar behind it. Goro kneeled and peered\r\ndown. It was very dark. From far below came a soft boompety-boomp. 

Then\r\na mere whisper of a crash.\r\n\r\nGoro got up, shaking his head. He dusted his knees and went away down\r\nthe road, growing smaller in the cold, lonely night.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nRafferty was a gambler of the old school. He didn\'t believe in any of\r\nthe fancy electronic gadgets that the casinos went in for these days,\r\ndidn\'t much care for the psionic games of chance and other tricky and\r\nprobably rigged affairs. Give him a good poker game any time, and he\r\nwould be happy.\r\n\r\nHe stood in the door of the Ganymede Casino, outlining himself against\r\nthe gaudy lights flashing within, standing there patiently. Inside, the\r\nrich and would-be rich of a dozen planets were enjoying themselves,\r\nplaying the brightly-lit games and throwing money around in handfuls.\r\n\r\nRafferty waited for some attention. His hand slid to the bulky roll in\r\nhis pocket--one hundred hundred-credit bills, 10,000 smackers in all.\r\nIt was all Rafferty had. He was here to triple it, or else.\r\n\r\nTomorrow 30,000 had to be handed over to Lee Walsh. It was the result\r\nof the one mistake Rafferty had made.\r\n\r\nWalsh was a big-time gambler, with ulcers and high blood pressure and\r\nten million in the bank. Rafferty was straight middle-time, a man who\r\ngenuinely enjoyed his chancy profession. And Walsh had said, "Why don\'t\r\nyou play something _I_ like to play? All the time poker, poker, poker.\r\nWhy don\'t you switch to something else."\r\n\r\n"I like poker," Rafferty said. "I win at poker. Why switch?"\r\n\r\nWalsh seemed to stiffen. "Let\'s have a little game of planet-faro,\r\nRafferty. Just you and me. I\'m tired of all this poker."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like planet-faro. It\'s a lousy game. All those flashing\r\nlights--it\'s more like pinball than honest-to-darn gambling."\r\n\r\n"You ain\'t chicken, Rafferty?"\r\n\r\n"Chicken?"\r\n\r\n"Yeah. 

Let\'s try some planet-faro."\r\n\r\nSo they did--and Rafferty had sat by leadenly while Walsh cleaned him\r\nout. Thirty thousand shiny credits down the drain, and the debt due\r\ntomorrow at noon. You didn\'t welsh on Walsh, either. It was sort of a\r\nslogan.\r\n\r\nRafferty didn\'t have the thirty thousand. He had two alternatives: he\r\ncould scrape up the cash somewhere and hand it over, or he could grab\r\nan out-system liner and get going toward Aldebaran, and hope to live.\r\nHe wouldn\'t--not for long.\r\n\r\nHe decided to scrape up the cash. And there was one sure way to do\r\nthat. Poker.\r\n\r\nPoker was getting to be an unpopular game, and there were two reasons\r\nfor it. One was the advent of more popular new types of gambling\r\ndevices; the other reason was that Rafferty was so good it didn\'t pay\r\nto compete against him. He often had trouble getting up a game. People\r\ntended to slink away when they heard Rafferty wanted to play poker. He\r\nplayed it hard and he played it mean, and he didn\'t lose too often.\r\n\r\nThat was why he had come to the Ganymede Casino. On the big\r\npleasure-moon, anyone could find some sort of game going--and if he\r\ncouldn\'t, the house would be glad to provide some competition. Rafferty\r\ndidn\'t much like the idea of playing a house operator, but he was\r\nconfident.\r\n\r\nHe patted the ten g\'s and waited. After a couple of minutes an\r\nimpeccably-dressed man in tails came over to him and smiled courteously.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir?"\r\n\r\n"My name is Rafferty. I\'m looking for a poker game in the house. There\r\none around I can get into?

"\r\n\r\nThe impeccable man frowned slightly. "I don\'t think so,\r\nMr.--ah--Rafferty. Wouldn\'t you care to try our Roto, or the\r\nplanet-faro, or robot roulette? We--"\r\n\r\n"I want to play poker," Rafferty said. The chips were down now; he had\r\nto stick to his specialty.\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'ll see what I can do. Would you wait here, please?

"\r\n\r\nRafferty waited. He waited while the impeccable man cruised around\r\nthe huge gameroom, murmuring gently to someone here, someone there.\r\nIn all cases the response was the same: a shrug, a curious glance in\r\nRafferty\'s direction, a quick and emphatic shake of the head.\r\n\r\nNo one wanted to play. Usually Rafferty could count on some fool\r\nmillionaire anxious to try to best the great Rafferty at five-card\r\nstud. Not today, though. There were no takers.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry, Mr. Rafferty; I couldn\'t seem to promote a game. But the\r\nplanet-faro--"\r\n\r\n"Poker," Rafferty said.\r\n\r\n"Would you object to playing a two-handed game with one of our\r\nemployees?" the usher asked suddenly. 

"Naturally he\'ll be staked by the\r\nhouse, and I think you\'ll find him fit competition for you."\r\n\r\nRafferty chewed at his lip. He needed the money--and if the house\r\noperator was staked by the casino, it might be possible to cart off\r\nquite a load.\r\n\r\n"Okay," he grunted. "Bring on your shill."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe usher led him to a small, highly-polished card table in the back,\r\nand signalled to a man waiting to one side.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Steel, this is Mr. Rafferty."\r\n\r\n"Hello," Rafferty said.\r\n\r\n"Pleased to meet you," said the other. His voice was a soft purr; his\r\nface, an expressionless mask. Rafferty smiled. He was quick to size up\r\nhis opponents, and this time he could tell he was up against a good one.\r\n\r\n"Chips?"\r\n\r\nA house girl had come by. She was clad only in a strip of something\r\nfilmy across her breasts and another round her middle, and she had a\r\ntrayfull of chips. Rafferty casually handed her the hundred bills and\r\naccepted his stack of chips. She also gave him an unopened deck of\r\ncards.\r\n\r\n"Care to?" Rafferty asked, offering the cards to his opponent.\r\n\r\n"No. Go ahead."\r\n\r\nMethodically Rafferty broke the seal, spilled the cards out, flipped\r\nthe jokers to one side, and riffled through the deck. There were\r\nfifty-two of them, all right, and they looked good. 

He started to\r\nshuffle.\r\n\r\nThe first few hands passed quickly. Steel was a quiet, noncommittal\r\nplayer who seemed to have a tremendous reserve of calmness. It wasn\'t\r\ntoo surprising, thought Rafferty, considering it wasn\'t his dough at\r\nstake. But a shill has professional pride.\r\n\r\nThe first three deals were in the nature of warmups, and Rafferty\r\nemerged from them twenty or thirty credits to the good. He felt the\r\ncards moving the right way; luck was with him tonight. 

He wondered if\r\nhe could come away with a million. The Casino had no limit.\r\n\r\nFourth hand he decided to experiment with some offensive tactics. Steel\r\ndealt; Rafferty scooped up his cards and looked them over. Jack, Four,\r\nEight, Seven, King. Spade, club, spade, heart, diamond. Coolly he\r\nfanned the cards out and pushed a hundred credits toward the middle of\r\nthe table. Steel saw him.\r\n\r\n"How many?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll stand pat."\r\n\r\n"So will I."\r\n\r\n"Five hundred," Rafferty said.\r\n\r\n"See that and raise it a hundred."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll bump to two."\r\n\r\n"I\'m with you," Steel said. "What do you have?"\r\n\r\nWithout a facial flicker Rafferty exposed his hand. "Jack high. 

You?

"\r\n\r\n"You beat me. It\'s your kitty."\r\n\r\nRafferty scooped the pot in, frowning inwardly. He\'d made his\r\nbluff--but Steel had been bluffing right along with him. It was only\r\nluck that the little man hadn\'t been holding a Queen.\r\n\r\nRafferty pulled Jack high again on the next deal, took three, came up\r\nwith nothing and folded. On the next hand both men played it cautiously\r\nand Rafferty dropped fifty credits when Steel\'s pair of kings took his\r\ntens.\r\n\r\nNext deal, Rafferty again came up with nothing. Inwardly he cursed; the\r\ncards weren\'t coming as well as they had. He decided to bluff again,\r\nsince the previous attempt hadn\'t yielded any information about his\r\nopponent\'s tactics.\r\n\r\nThis time he pushed the bet up to a thousand before calling.\r\n\r\n"Three sevens," Steel said.\r\n\r\n"You beat me," Rafferty said, and collapsed his hand.\r\n\r\n"Mind if I look?" Steel said.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Rafferty. He was surprised; it was a rank amateur\'s trick\r\nto ask to look at a hand that had been tossed in. Coming from a cool\r\ncustomer like Steel, it didn\'t make much sense.\r\n\r\nBut slowly Rafferty began to fathom the way his opponent\'s mind worked.\r\nAnd slowly, as his genius for the game asserted itself, Rafferty began\r\nto win.\r\n\r\nBy 2100 his pile of chips totalled near fifty thousand. It was enough\r\nto pay off Walsh and still come out with a comfortable profit for the\r\nevening\'s work--but Rafferty didn\'t want to quit. He didn\'t play the\r\ngame that way.\r\n\r\nHe decided to go for a killing. He had Steel figured, now and he could\r\ntake the house for a fortune.\r\n\r\nNursing three jacks and a pair of fours, he pushed the betting higher\r\nand higher. Steel kept right with him.\r\n\r\n"Three thousand? I\'ll see you and raise one."\r\n\r\nWithout letting expression cross his face, Rafferty pushed a few more\r\ncredits out. Then a few more. 

Then a few more. Five thousand credits\r\nhung on this deal, now.\r\n\r\nHe remained totally blank-faced. That was the secret of poker: never to\r\ntip off an opponent to anything. Steel was good, but Steel kept giving\r\nhimself away.\r\n\r\nLike now, for instance. Perhaps the shill didn\'t know it, but his right\r\neyebrow was twitching faintly. So far, every time Steel had bluffed a\r\nweak hand, that eyebrow had twitched.\r\n\r\nWell, now Rafferty had him. He had a full house; it was going to take a\r\nbunch of fancy cards to top it. And Steel was almost certainly bluffing.\r\n\r\n"Six thousand," Rafferty said.\r\n\r\n"Seven."\r\n\r\n"Seven five."\r\n\r\nIt reached nine. Finally Rafferty said, "Okay. What do you have?"\r\n\r\nCasually Steel lowered his hand. Jack, Queen, Queen, Queen, Queen. That\r\nmade four Queens.\r\n\r\nHe hadn\'t been bluffing.\r\n\r\nAnd Rafferty was out nine thousand credits.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe kept his composure, but inwardly he was disturbed. By all rights\r\nSteel _had_ to be bluffing--but there they were, four queens.\r\n\r\nThe game progressed. A few curious onlookers had gathered. By playing\r\ncautiously, Rafferty started piling up chips again. His winnings\r\nmounted to a hundred thousand, hundred fifty. He had Steel figured now\r\nfor sure.\r\n\r\nBut it wasn\'t as sure as all that.\r\n\r\nRafferty staked five thousand on a straight flush. Steel saw him and\r\nadded five hundred on top of it.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go with you," Rafferty said. "Here\'s another thousand." Straight\r\nflush, Queen high. Only three hands could possibly beat him--and one\r\nof them was a royal flush. It didn\'t seem likely. Besides, the lower\r\ncorner of Steel\'s mouth was drawn back, as it usually was when he had a\r\nfairly good hand and was playing it big.\r\n\r\nThe chips flew out madly. Rafferty watched the pile grow; neither man\r\nwould let the cat die. Ten, twelve thousand credits now. Fifteen. In\r\nthirty years of poker, Rafferty had never had fifteen thousand credits\r\nriding on one hand. But he was sure he had it.\r\n\r\n"What are you holding?" Steel asked finally.\r\n\r\n"Straight flush, Queen high." He started to reach for the chips.\r\n\r\nSteel\'s mild, purring voice interrupted him. "_What suit?_"\r\n\r\nFor the first time that night Rafferty\'s composure left him. "C-Clubs,"\r\nhe stammered.\r\n\r\n"Spades," Steel said sweetly, and put down the eight to Queen,\r\ninclusive and consecutive.\r\n\r\nIt just didn\'t figure, Rafferty thought glumly. He wasn\'t as annoyed\r\nover the wild improbability of two straight flushes the same hand as he\r\nwas because he had failed to guess Steel\'s facial reaction properly.\r\nHe\'d been dead wrong.\r\n\r\nHe got wronger. Steel sat calmly without saying a word except when\r\nnecessary, and gobbled in the chips. It seemed to Rafferty that Steel\r\nwas reading his every move.\r\n\r\nHe was holding two pair, and played it big. Steel stayed right with\r\nhim, and when the payoff came:\r\n\r\n"Three fours."\r\n\r\nThree fours won. But Steel wouldn\'t have ridden that far on the trio\r\nunless he knew pretty well that Rafferty didn\'t have much to show. He\r\nseemed to _know_. And as the game progressed, he grew less and less\r\nreadable himself. It was a strange reversal for Rafferty, who was\r\naccustomed to detect his opponent\'s idiosyncrasies within three deals\r\nand to play them mercilessly from then on.\r\n\r\n"Two kings," Rafferty said.\r\n\r\n"Two aces."\r\n\r\nRafferty looked down at his pile of chips and counted them. Eight\r\nhundred credits left. Eight hundred lousy credits.\r\n\r\nIt was just enough to book passage to Aldebaran. Rafferty slumped in\r\nhis chair.\r\n\r\nThe gambler in him urged him to go on, to try to win the thirty\r\nthousand he needed and clear out. But another part of him told him\r\nit was futile; Steel was getting sharper and sharper, and it was\r\ninevitable he\'d lose even the remaining eight hundred. He didn\'t want\r\nthat to happen.\r\n\r\nHe rose stiffly.\r\n\r\n"Had enough?" Steel asked.\r\n\r\n"I think so."\r\n\r\n"I hope I haven\'t discouraged you. We can still play some more, if you\r\nlike?"\r\n\r\n"What\'s the use?" Rafferty said hollowly. 

"I can\'t win. And at least\r\nthis way I\'ll be on Aldebaran tomorrow when Walsh and his gunmen come\r\nlooking for me."\r\n\r\n"What\'s that?

"\r\n\r\n"Never mind." Rafferty turned away, scooping up his remaining chips.\r\nHe cashed them in and shambled out the door, still unable fully to\r\nunderstand that for the first time in his life he had met his master\r\nat the poker table.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter Rafferty was gone, the impeccable usher came over to Steel, who\r\nwas sitting patiently by the huge pile of chips.\r\n\r\n"You clean him out?"\r\n\r\n"Just about," Steel said. 

"He had a little left to book passage with."\r\n\r\n"It looked bad for a while, there. He was better than a hundred\r\nthousand ahead of you."\r\n\r\n"It took me some time to detect his playing patterns," the house\r\nman said. "He was very, very good. He\'s the best player I\'ve ever\r\nencountered."\r\n\r\n"But he couldn\'t beat you, natch!"\r\n\r\n"Hardly. Once I had penetrated his defenses, he was at my mercy." Steel\r\nrose, smiling blandly. "I took 9200 credits from him. It\'s thirsty\r\nwork. 

How about a drink?"\r\n\r\n"Sure thing," the impeccable man said. "I guess I can spare a drink for\r\nthe best house operator this casino has." He took an oilcan from his\r\njacket and inserted it at the back of Steel\'s neck. The robot grinned\r\nhappily at the lubrication; his soft photonic eyes beamed.\r\n\r\n"I enjoy playing poker," Steel said. "But someday you must enlarge my\r\ncircuits so I can take part in planet-faro too. 

It looks like a very\r\ninteresting game."\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


The hell with it, he\r\nthought happily. He was going to get himself completely stewed tonight.\r\nLive high, die young, and have a good-looking corpse.\r\n\r\nOr maybe it would be better simply to get aboard a spaceship and try to\r\nget away. Maybe the Interstellar Police would never find him.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head dismally. 

That wouldn\'t work, either. Nothing would\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nIf only he\'d had some practice fighting a Dornellian!\r\n\r\nHe reached out for his beer, not noticing that someone had taken the\r\nvacant seat next to him. His elbow collided with a glass. The glass\r\ntipped, pouring a green, bubbling liquor all over the Dornellian\r\nsitting next to him.\r\n\r\n"Stupid Earthman!" snapped the Dornellian contemptuously. "A clumsy\r\nbeast like you shouldn\'t be allowed to enter a public place!"\r\n\r\nWith one hairy paw, the Dornellian shoved against Larry\'s shoulder,\r\nintending to push him off the bar stool.\r\n\r\nLarry moved back, more in astonishment than anything else. He hadn\'t\r\nknown that Dornellians had any particular prejudice against Earthmen,\r\nbut there was unmistakable racial hatred in the alien\'s voice. He put\r\nout his hand to the bar and stopped himself from falling off the stool.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the idea of that?" Larry growled. "That was an accident, and--"\r\n\r\n"Are you trying to argue with me? Here is the rest of the drink!" The\r\nDornellian laughed and heaved the remaining contents of the glass in\r\nLarry\'s face.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA blinding tide of red fury washed over Larry. Without thinking,\r\nreacting purely by instinct, he lashed out at the Dornellian.\r\n\r\nHis fist didn\'t contact; it was blocked by the heavy forearm of his\r\nopponent. A hand raked out at Larry, a hand with six fingers, each of\r\nwhich was tipped with long, cutting talons. Larry moved his head aside\r\nbarely in time. The talons raked across his cheek, drawing blood. If he\r\nhadn\'t ducked, the cut would have ripped his throat open.\r\n\r\nThe Dornellian\'s other hand slashed out. Larry blocked it with his own\r\narm and sent a hard left to the midsection of the eight-foot monster.\r\n\r\nThe Dornellian backed away, snarling. The fight was on for real, now.\r\n"Little Earthman, I\'m going to kill you!"\r\n\r\nHe leaped in suddenly, and his fist smashed against Larry\'s face. Larry\r\nrolled with the blow, but it brought the taste of blood to his mouth.\r\n\r\nHis feet moving fast, the Earthman bobbed back away from the giant.\r\nHe felt a glow of pleasure within himself. Here was his chance to\r\npractice a little with a Dornellian! What better training was there for\r\na championship bout than a barroom brawl? He had to watch out for those\r\nclaws though--those deadly razors that sprouted from the Dornellian\'s\r\nfingertips.\r\n\r\nTwo other Dornellians started to move in, but an Aldebaranian--a huge\r\nreptilian beast, slow-moving but powerful--stepped in front of them.\r\n\r\n"Keep back," he hissed, in his snakelike voice. "This is a personal\r\nquarrel."\r\n\r\nLarry heard an Arcturian spider-man click his mandibles together and\r\nwhisper: "Yes, let the Earthman fight it out by himself."\r\n\r\nLarry wasn\'t too worried. 

He had fought to the death on half a hundred\r\nplanets, and hadn\'t been killed yet. An ordinary Dornellian didn\'t\r\nbother him much. He moved in confidently for the knockout.\r\n\r\nHis fist lashed out, but his opponent was even faster. Larry connected\r\nwith nothing but empty air, and the Dornellian\'s claws raked down his\r\nside as the other hand slammed against the side of his head.\r\n\r\nDazed, Larry danced back. His arm was dripping blood, and his head felt\r\ngroggy and heavy.\r\n\r\nThe Dornellian threw a left jab, and Larry blocked it with his own left\r\narm. But the giant had done something unexpected. Instead of striking\r\nwith his closed fist, he had suddenly extended his fingers. The sharp\r\nclaws stabbed deep into the muscle of the Earthman\'s forearm, sending a\r\nwave of pain to his shoulder.\r\n\r\nAgain Larry backed away, his arm aching from the wounds. Quickly, he\r\nreversed his direction and stepped back in. This time, he used a kick\r\nbut the Dornellian sidestepped. The toe of Larry\'s boot caught his hip.\r\nCursing, the Dornellian closed in.\r\n\r\nHe punched a hand forward, claws extended. Larry stepped to one side\r\nand grabbed the hairy wrist. Using the giant\'s strength and weight\r\nto his own advantage, he propelled the monster across the room,\r\nslamming him up against the bar. Then he leaped forward to smash in the\r\nDornellian\'s ribcage with his heavy boots.\r\n\r\nHe was not quick enough. The giant rolled aside and sprang to his feet.\r\nSnarling viciously, he advanced toward the Earthman.\r\n\r\nOne hand came down in a hard, chopping blow. Larry managed to fend\r\nit off, but the Dornellian\'s other hand slugged into the pit of his\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\nWeak with pain, Larry staggered back. He aimed a kick at the alien\'s\r\nshin, and it connected hard. Taking advantage of his opportunity, Larry\r\nstepped in. His heel came down on the Dornellian\'s toes at the same\r\ntime that his fist slammed into the bristly jaw.\r\n\r\nThe giant reeled backwards, his taloned hand slashing through the air.\r\nHe regained his balance and came forward again, but this time Larry was\r\nready for him.\r\n\r\nThe Dornellian stepped square into a blow to the stomach.\r\n\r\nOddly enough, it didn\'t seem to bother him much. Then Larry remembered\r\nthat the Dornellian nervous system wasn\'t much like an Earthman\'s; the\r\nnerves just weren\'t in the same places.\r\n\r\nBut where were they? Again he cursed Blackmer. The manager hadn\'t told\r\nhim anything about Dornellians, had let him sign for the fight with\r\nFornax Kedrin even though it would be sheer murder.\r\n\r\n_Well_, Larry thought somberly, _I\'ll learn tonight. If I ever get out\r\nof this bar alive._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe took a deep breath and glanced at the giant, who had recovered from\r\nLarry\'s onslaught. The Dornellian stepped in with a fast one-two--a\r\nrake across the face with his left and a smash to the heart with his\r\nright.\r\n\r\nThe claws to his face alerted Larry for the blow to the heart;\r\nhe stepped back just enough to avoid being really hurt. But the\r\nDornellian\'s talons had raked his forehead, cutting in deeply. Blood\r\nwas pouring down over his eyes.\r\n\r\nHe took a quick look around the bar. The customers were gathered in\r\na ring and were watching the contest wide-eyed, as if they were in\r\nfifty-credit ringside seats.\r\n\r\nThe Dornellian still looked relatively unscratched, while Larry knew he\r\nlooked as though he\'d rolled over a barbed-wire fence. But in spite of\r\nthe blood, Larry had finally gotten the measure of his opponent. The\r\neight-foot giant weighed close to five hundred pounds; his mass was too\r\ngreat for him to be able to handle his body rapidly, no matter how\r\nfast his reflexes were.\r\n\r\nLarry moved in again. He planted a hard right directly in the giant\'s\r\nthroat--there _had_ to be nerves there. The Dornellian gagged and\r\ndropped his head. Larry smiled and slammed his fist into the giant\'s\r\nrib cage, doubling him up even more. He could almost hear the crowd\r\ncheering now as he moved in for the kill.\r\n\r\nHe sucked in his breath and lifted one foot from the floor. His right\r\nfist came up from his knees, gaining speed as it rose. Like a hammer,\r\nit crashed into the hairy jaw of the Dornellian, and Larry could feel\r\nbone splintering against his knuckles.\r\n\r\nLike an oak with rotten roots, the great Dornellian toppled to the\r\nfloor. He landed with a crash that seemed to shake the building.\r\n\r\nLarry stood over the fallen giant for a moment, catching his breath,\r\nwondering when the referee was going to start the count. Then he\r\nrealized there wasn\'t going to be any count. There wasn\'t any referee.\r\n\r\nHis arms were quivering, and his face was dripping with blood. He\r\nturned away, mopping his face clean, and started to pick up his\r\nunfinished beer when the wailing of sirens echoed through the bar.\r\n\r\nPolice! Someone had called the Dornellian police!\r\n\r\nThe Arcturian spider-man sidled up to him. "Well done, Earthman," he\r\nsaid in his whispering voice. "Come with me; I have a car outside."\r\nWithout another word, the Arcturian scuttled toward the door.\r\n\r\nLarry paused for a fraction of a second before making up his mind. As\r\nwell trust the Arcturian as anyone; if the police caught him, his life\r\nwouldn\'t be worth a counterfeit credit.\r\n\r\nNo one tried to stop him as he ran out the door.\r\n\r\nThe Arcturian\'s car was waiting just outside. Larry climbed in, and the\r\nspider-man slammed one of his many feet down on the accelerator. The\r\ncar shot off into the night, its turboelectric engine humming smoothly.\r\n\r\n"Well, Earthman," said the grating, whispering voice, "You made hash\r\nout of the Dornellian. Frankly, I was surprised.

"\r\n\r\n"So was I," Larry said. "I don\'t know why I\'m bothering to run away.\r\nAll they\'ll have to do is pick me up at my hotel."\r\n\r\nThe Arcturian chuckled dryly. 

"No. I don\'t think anyone recognized you.\r\nDon\'t forget that all Earthmen look alike to other beings. The only\r\nreason I knew who you were is that I\'m a fan of yours. I was glad to\r\nsee you beat that Dornellian, believe me."\r\n\r\n"Thanks," Larry said. "But it\'s not going to do me any good when I get\r\ninto the ring against Fornax Kedrin. If an ordinary Dornellian citizen\r\nputs up a fight like that, what am I going to do against a professional\r\nboxer?"\r\n\r\nThe Arcturian laughed again. "Just get in there and fight, Filmore. You\r\ncan handle him. 

I\'m sure you can."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe car pulled up before the hotel where Larry and his manager were\r\nstaying, and Larry got out. The Arcturian waved to him and drove off.\r\n\r\nWearily, Larry dragged himself inside and into the elevator.\r\n\r\n"Seventeen, please."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, Mr. Filmore," said the Dornellian elevator boy.\r\n\r\nHe pushed open the door to his room and dropped on the bed, dead tired.\r\nHe didn\'t dare look in the mirror; he was afraid to see what a mess the\r\nDornellian had made out of his face, which hadn\'t been any too neat\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n"Blackmer?" he called.\r\n\r\nThere was no answer. 

The manager was not around. Larry got up, looked\r\nbleary-eyed into the other room, and, seeing no one, dropped off into\r\na deep sleep. His last thought before he blacked out was that he\'d get\r\ninto the ring and do his best. He\'d already beaten _one_ Dornellian;\r\nhow tough could Fornax Kedrin be? And what did it matter anyway? 

He\r\nwas bound to get killed sooner or later anyway. That was the unspoken\r\nassumption every fighter operated under.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke the following morning, he didn\'t feel quite so certain\r\nabout things. The brawl the night before had taken a terrific toll on\r\nhis nervous system, and he knew that he\'d be butchered if he stepped\r\ninto the ring with the Dornellian champ. He was in no condition to\r\nfight.\r\n\r\n"Blackmer? 

You here?"\r\n\r\nThe manager\'s bed had been slept in, but there was no sign of him.\r\nLarry groped for the house phone, grabbed it, spoke into it. "Do you\r\nknow where Mr. 

Blackmer is?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s in the bar, sir," said the switchboard boy. "Do you want me to\r\ncall him for you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, please."\r\n\r\nA moment later, Larry heard the manager\'s harsh voice. "Blackmer here.\r\nWho\'s calling?"\r\n\r\n"This is Larry. I\'m ready for that fight, Blackmer," he said, hoping\r\nhe\'d have the strength to go through with it. "And after I get through\r\nwith the Dornellian, I\'m going to knock your teeth in. This is my last\r\nfight for you."\r\n\r\n"Now Larry," Blackmer said. "Don\'t be hasty. I--"\r\n\r\n"Shut up! We\'re quits! I may get killed in that ring, but I\'ll fight\r\njust this once and--"\r\n\r\n"What? Haven\'t you heard? 

The fight\'s off!"\r\n\r\nLarry blinked in astonishment. "How would I have heard?"\r\n\r\n"I thought the news was all over. That\'s why I didn\'t bother to wake\r\nyou. Fornax Kedrin is in the hospital. He got his jaw broken in a bar\r\nbrawl last night. 

Nobody knows who did it. But I got another bout lined\r\nup on Domerang VI with--"\r\n\r\n"Skip it," Larry said. "I\'ll discuss it with you some other time."\r\n\r\nLarry slowly dropped the receiver back on the hook. 

He grinned. And\r\nthen he began to laugh.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was nothing special about the little man who came into Larry\'s\r\nplace, unless it might have been his air of vague familiarity and the\r\nmixed expression on his face. He looked disgusted and defensive and at\r\nthe same time a little resentful, with a dash of something else thrown\r\nin which none of us recognized until later.\r\n\r\nI\'d have mistaken him for another reporter from the _Advertiser_\r\nacross the street if the five newsmen already at the bar hadn\'t given\r\neach other a blank look that meant only one thing: none of them knew\r\nhim. Neither did Larry, who was trying to bring in the first broadcast\r\nfrom Mars on the television set bracketed to the wall over his whiskey\r\nstock, and who wasn\'t pleased at having his little after-hours party\r\ncrashed.\r\n\r\n"The bar\'s closed," Larry said. His tone didn\'t invite argument. 

"City\r\nordinance. No customers after 1:00 a.m."\r\n\r\nThe little man looked at the clock, which said 3:15, and then at the\r\nfront windows which were shuttered tight. Then he looked at the six of\r\nus sitting at the bar with our drinks.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll have bourbon and water," he said. He sat down at the end of the\r\nbar on the stool next to mine and looked at his reflection in the\r\nmirror without approval.\r\n\r\nLarry got the look that bartenders get with troublesome customers.\r\n\r\n"The bar\'s closed," he said again. "It\'s a city--"\r\n\r\n"Water on the side," the little man said. "Don\'t mix it."\r\n\r\nAbe Marker, who does sports for the _Advertiser_, got up and checked\r\nthe front-door lock. The thumb-catch hadn\'t been thrown, so Abe put it\r\non and came back to the bar.\r\n\r\n"Nobody else will wander in," he said. "Make with the t-v, Larry.\r\nYou\'re holding up the show."\r\n\r\nLarry looked stubborn.\r\n\r\n"It\'s after 1:00 a.m.," he said. 

"And that door was supposed to be\r\nlocked. There\'s a city ordinance--"\r\n\r\n"You\'re breaking it already," the little man said, looking at us. He\r\ndidn\'t seem angry, just weary and disgusted. 

"Not that I give a damn.\r\nAll I want is a bourbon and water."\r\n\r\n"Better give it to him, Larry," Willard Saxton said from down the bar.\r\nWillard is the _Advertiser\'s_ science editor and is an authority on the\r\nplanets, especially Mars. "He\'ll probably turn you in if you throw him\r\nout."\r\n\r\nLarry muttered and looked mulish, but he rang up the little man\'s money\r\nand gave him a bourbon and water. The little guy drank it and looked\r\nat himself in the bar mirror with an expression that was just short\r\nof being a sneer. Larry grunted and went back to fiddling with the\r\ntelevision set.\r\n\r\nAbe Marker came over and sat down on the stool to my left.\r\n\r\n"They\'re doing this all over town tonight," he said, explaining to the\r\nlittle man across me. "The bars have to observe curfew as usual, but\r\nmost of them are letting a few regular customers stay late to see the\r\nMarscast. Everybody is anxious to know what Colonel Sanderson and his\r\ncrew found up there, so--"\r\n\r\n"They\'re going to be disappointed," the little man said. 

He sounded\r\nsour but positive. "Mars ain\'t what people think it is, not by a hell\r\nof a sight. It stinks."\r\n\r\nWe all looked up at that, and somebody snickered.\r\n\r\n"Have you been to Mars, sir?"\r\n\r\nThe little man didn\'t seem to mind when we laughed.\r\n\r\n"Maybe," he said, and shoved his shot glass forward. "Another bourbon,\r\nbartender."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe station announcer came on screen then and told us what we already\r\nknew, that contact with Colonel Sanderson\'s party was delayed because\r\nof transmission difficulties. The Sanderson expedition would leave Mars\r\nfor Earth in two more days, when the current opposition was completed,\r\nbut in the meantime the program sponsors appreciated the interest shown\r\nby their public and would relay the broadcast to us as soon as contact\r\nwas established.\r\n\r\nA film cartoon featuring a lizard named Freddie came on next, and Larry\r\nturned down the sound so he could hear orders for refills. The little\r\nman drank his bourbon and water and sneered at his reflection in the\r\nmirror; none of us paid him any further attention, but talk started up\r\nagain along the bar.\r\n\r\nSomebody at the other end asked how long it took a television signal\r\nto travel across all that space, and choked on his drink when Willard\r\nSaxton told him.\r\n\r\n"My God," he said when he stopped coughing. "You mean Mars is so far\r\naway it takes three minutes just to _see_ it?"\r\n\r\nAll of us laughed at that but Larry and the little man at the end of\r\nthe bar.\r\n\r\n"What I\'m wondering," somebody else said, "Is how the colonel and his\r\nboys feel after breathing nothing but canned air for a year."\r\n\r\n"Maybe the air up there is better than our scientists think," Abe\r\nMarker said. He winked at us and looked at the little man on my right.\r\n"How about it, friend? Is the air good on Mars?"\r\n\r\n"Breathable, but not good," the little guy said. 

"It smells like dead\r\nfish."\r\n\r\nSilence fell along the bar while we waited for a straight man to raise\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\nWillard Saxton took the bait. "And why should it smell so, may I ask?"\r\n\r\n"Because Mars is lousy with fish," the little man said. "And because\r\nwhen fish die, they stink."\r\n\r\nLarry did a brisk business for a few minutes while we sized the little\r\nguy up again. He definitely wasn\'t drunk, but the task of deciding\r\nwhether he was being dead-pan-comic or just nasty was a sort of\r\nchallenge that called for thought.\r\n\r\n"But you\'d need extensive oceans to support so many fish," Willard\r\nSaxton argued, still taking it seriously. "And if Mars had oceans we\'d\r\nhave seen them long ago. They reflect light."\r\n\r\n"Mars is too level for oceans," the little man said. "The water spreads\r\nout thin to make one big marsh, and you can\'t see it because the weeds\r\nthat grow up from the bottom camouflage it."\r\n\r\nSomebody down the bar said, "This gets curiouser and curiouser," and\r\neverybody laughed again but Willard and Larry and the little comic.\r\nSomebody else asked if he was a professional and what show was he on,\r\nbut he didn\'t answer. He just pushed his shot glass forward instead.\r\n\r\n"Another bourbon," he said.\r\n\r\nThe announcer came on screen again when the lizard cartoon went off\r\nand said that the Mars party\'s signal was beginning to come through\r\nand that as soon as it cleared up they would put it on the cable. Then\r\nhe told us about a new kind of pretzel prepared with a special salt\r\nguaranteed not to give us hardening of the arteries, and after that we\r\nhad another film cartoon. This one was about two crows at a circus, but\r\nnobody could follow it because Larry turned down the sound again.\r\n\r\nBetween his third and fourth stingers Willard Saxton--who had a\r\nreputation to uphold, being science editor of the _Advertiser_--had\r\nmade up his mind by now to put the little man in his place. It burned\r\nhim brown to see this character drinking bourbon and sneering at\r\nhimself in the mirror and not caring a damn what we thought, and it put\r\nWillard under a sort of obligation to show him up.\r\n\r\n"Reliable tests have conclusively proved," Willard said, "that the\r\natmosphere of Mars contains only minute traces of water vapor, and that\r\nits oxygen content is less than one-hundredth the density necessary to\r\nsustain human life. Spectroanalysis findings--"\r\n\r\n"A spectroanalysis of Earth from Mars," the little man said, "shows\r\nnothing beyond our Heaviside layer, and proves that we can\'t live here\r\nbecause nothing can breathe pure ozone."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe finished his bourbon and made chains of wet rings on the bartop with\r\nhis glass. The mixed look on his face was so strong that for a moment I\r\nalmost thought of the name for it.\r\n\r\nWillard stalled for time by ordering another stinger--a double, this\r\ntime--and Abe Marker took over.\r\n\r\n"How about those pictures of Martian dust storms the boys at Palomar\r\nmake?" Abe asked. "You can\'t have dust storms on a marshy planet, can\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"Those aren\'t dust storms," the little man said. "They\'re clouds of\r\ngnats."\r\n\r\n"_Gnats?_" we all said at once, and somebody down the bar,\r\nquicker-witted than the rest of us, added: "Gnats to you too, Charlie!"\r\n\r\n"A fact," the little man said, but not as if he cared. 

"They travel in\r\nswarms thousands of miles wide, and they bite like hell."\r\n\r\nWe sat and watched the two voiceless crows flap through the television\r\ncartoon for a while. Nobody spoke until the film was over and the\r\nscreen went blank, when the little man caught Larry\'s eye and held up\r\none finger.\r\n\r\n"Bourbon," he said.\r\n\r\nWe heard a confused muttering of voices in the background and waited\r\nexpectantly for Colonel Sanderson to speak to us from Mars, but\r\napparently the network people were still having trouble with their\r\ntransmission beam. The screen stayed blank.\r\n\r\n"You left out the interesting part, Charlie," somebody called from down\r\nthe bar. "The Martian natives. How about them?"\r\n\r\n"There aren\'t any--as you\'d know them," the little man said. He seemed\r\nto grow thoughtful for a moment. "But they are intelligent. They do\r\nthings you couldn\'t do."\r\n\r\n"Such as what?" somebody asked.\r\n\r\nThe little man shrugged. "Teleport. They\'re good at it too."\r\n\r\nSaxton let out a laugh. "That would make them more intelligent than\r\nus!" he said. "What do these Martians look like?"\r\n\r\nThe little man screwed up his face distastefully. "Frogs."\r\n\r\nThe reporter who had asked about natives got choked on his drink and\r\nhad to be pounded on the back. On my left, Abe Marker leaned against\r\nthe bar to look past me at the little guy.\r\n\r\n"Frogs we got now," he said admiringly. "By the billions?"\r\n\r\n"There are more frogs on Mars," the little man said, "than there are\r\ngnats and fish together, and they never stop croaking. You\'d have to\r\nhear it to believe it."\r\n\r\nThe television screen lit up suddenly, chopping off conversation, and\r\nwe were watching the first Marscast in history.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nColonel Sanderson himself was talking. He looked the way Stanley must\r\nhave looked when he found Livingstone, gaunt and bearded and jumpy; and\r\nhis crew, lined up behind him before the ship\'s pickup camera, were in\r\nno better shape. The lot of them stared hungrily out at us as if they\r\nhad just found a peephole into Heaven and couldn\'t wait to see if\r\nthere was a gate farther along the fence.\r\n\r\n"... established conceptions of Martian areography are completely\r\nerroneous," the colonel was saying. "There are no drifting deserts\r\nof sand or howling typhoons of ferrous dust. We can show you actual\r\nconditions better by camera, I think, than they could be detailed in\r\nwords."\r\n\r\nThe view jumped to another camera aimed from an outside port, and we\r\nsaw Mars. Colonel Sanderson\'s voice kept up a running commentary behind\r\nthe scene, but we only half heard him.\r\n\r\nThe ship rested in about two feet of water. Around it the whole world\r\ncurved up to the horizon in a shallow concave sweep like the inside of\r\na great rusty bowl, lined with knee-high reeds that grew as far as the\r\neye could see out of a knee-deep marsh. A fist-sized sun hung low in\r\nthe sky, its glare dulled to a muddy crimson by a shimmering cloud of\r\ngnats that whirled and danced to infinity. There was a sort of vast,\r\nfeatureless roaring in the background that sounded like Niagara at two\r\nhundred yards, not deafening but loud enough to force Colonel Sanderson\r\nto raise his voice.\r\n\r\n"The frog noise is worst," he was saying. "It drives us to the point\r\nof insanity at times.... One member of our party has succumbed to it\r\nalready, a machinist named Willkins who disappeared two weeks ago.\r\nApparently the poor fellow drowned himself in the marsh, since no trace\r\nof him has been found since."\r\n\r\nThat was when I realized why the little man on the stool beside me\r\nlooked so familiar--because I had seen his pictures in the papers,\r\nalong with the rest of Sanderson\'s crew, a thousand times during the\r\npast year. The mixed expression on his face made sense now, too; he\r\nwasn\'t only disgusted and defensive, he was _guilty_.\r\n\r\n"So that\'s how you knew what it was like," I said. "You couldn\'t stick\r\nit out with the others, so you jumped ship. You deserted!"\r\n\r\nHe gave me a hangdog look. "It\'s not deserting unless the country is at\r\nwar," he said. "It\'s just going over the hill, A.W.O.L."\r\n\r\nThe television roar got louder, and when I looked up the ship\'s\r\ncameraman was doing a close-up for our benefit. He panned the shot\r\ndownward until we seemed to be standing ten feet above the marsh, and\r\nat that distance I could see plainly what it was that caused the uproar.\r\n\r\nThe water between the reddish-brown reeds was thick with huge frogs,\r\nall blinking and croaking like mad.\r\n\r\nI remember thinking then that you couldn\'t really blame a man for\r\njumping ship in a hole like that. It was bad enough to be stuck\r\nthirty-odd million miles from home, so far that light itself needed\r\nthree minutes to--\r\n\r\n"Hey, wait up!" I said to the little guy, who was sneering at himself\r\nin the mirror again. "If you went A.W.O.L. up there, then how the hell\r\ndid you get back _here_?"\r\n\r\nI didn\'t find out.\r\n\r\nThe guy was gone. He had been standing there so close I could have\r\ntouched him, but now he was gone. I looked around quick. 

Nobody else\r\nseemed to have noticed. All eyes were on the TV screen.\r\n\r\nThen I saw it. On the floor. Two wet marks--right where the guy should\r\nhave been, where he _was_. Two wet marks that had a funny shape to\r\nthem--web-like.\r\n\r\nI felt my throat tighten at the thought. I shook my head. 

What was\r\ngoing through it was fantastic, impossible and downright lunacy. There\r\nwas an intelligent life-form on Mars--beings that looked like frogs\r\nand could teleport. Could they also mimic human shape temporarily?\r\nEspecially if they got hold of one for a model--say a missing\r\ncrewman....\r\n\r\n"Hey! Where are you going? 

Don\'t you want to see the Marscast?"\r\n\r\nI was walking to the door. I looked back at the barkeep. "I\'ve seen\r\nenough, Larry, I got things to do."\r\n\r\nHe shrugged. 

"Yeh, what?

"\r\n\r\n"Like hunting frogs," I told him as I shoved the door open. "I got a\r\nhunch we\'ll be doing a lot of that before very long...."\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\nGod knows I didn\'t want Hacker in the preliminary delegation right from\r\nthe start. I wasn\'t thinking, either, of the screwball ways history can\r\ngo about poetically repeating itself sometimes. I just knew that an\r\nuppity, smart-alecky kid of fifty could only cause trouble.\r\n\r\nHe already had.\r\n\r\nRayna had been our earlier landfall on the First Interstellar\r\nExpedition. It possessed a fairly intelligent form of life, even if\r\nthe Raynans were oviparous and technologically retarded. Hacker had\r\ntaken over the bulldozer to clear the area around our craft, _Terra I_,\r\nand he had been repeatedly told to stay very close to it. But no, he\r\ninsisted on flattening out the peat-like top of the nearest hill too.\r\nUnfortunately that hilltop was an incubation bed for Raynan fledglings.\r\nThe massacre involved not only a vast number of hatching eggs but five\r\nadult females, and we had to get away pronto while thousands of paper\r\nlimbs waved threateningly at the murderers from Earth.\r\n\r\nI\'m only the Science Chronicler of this expedition but Dr. Barnes is\r\nChief Medical Officer. His protests should have mattered where mine\r\ndidn\'t. "I\'m a hundred per cent behind Johnson," he told Captain\r\nWeber. "That kid\'s no damned good. The three of us will go into town\r\nwith these Newtaneans and, sure as I\'m standing here, Hacker will do\r\nsomething wrong."\r\n\r\nCaptain Weber, looking worried as usual, tried to explain. "He\'ll\r\njust do the chauffeuring." But he got off that tack immediately when\r\nhe saw we were not following along. "Look, I know he\'s a pest. But\r\nthis is a political matter, for the good of the Space Corps. His\r\ngreat-great-uncle is President of the World Council. For all I know the\r\nold man hates his guts, won\'t listen to a word he says, but let\'s not\r\ntake any chances. 

We\'re going to need plenty of these expeditions. 

And\r\nhyper-drive craft take an awful lot out of the economy."\r\n\r\nThe upshot of the matter was that we patriotically agreed to the setup.\r\nThe captain gave Hacker a good chewing-out about respecting the rights\r\nof the Newtaneans.\r\n\r\nThe kid turned out to be surprisingly amenable on that score. "They\'re\r\n_human_!" he said, and I could see he was very sincere about it. "I\r\nwouldn\'t do anything to hurt them, sir. 

What\'s more, they must be\r\nalmost as smart as we are and I\'m not about to commit suicide."\r\n\r\nSo the three of us got into the jeep and rolled out of _Terra I_ onto\r\nNewtane\'s soil.\r\n\r\nI still felt uncomfortable about Hacker, though. He had tasted blood\r\non Rayna and the effect of that on him had been unusually bad; he had\r\nacquired a reckless attitude toward the rights of intelligent life,\r\nhis own included.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs if to prove me wrong, he drove very carefully over the special\r\nroad the Newtaneans had laid out overnight from our landing area\r\nto the highway a mile or so away. The three carloads of scowling\r\nplenipotentiaries up ahead looked appealingly funny. While the\r\nNewtaneans were remarkably, even handsomely, like us (except for a\r\ncertain closeness of the eyes and a reversed ordering of their fingers)\r\ntheir facial muscles carried different emotional convictions. On our\r\nlanding ten hours before those officials had thought our smiling faces\r\nindicated angry aggressiveness and we had been equally uncertain about\r\ntheir intentions. But their Semanticizer had eventually made the true\r\nstate of affairs clear. Evolution had determined that an upward set of\r\nNewtanean facial muscles meant a bad situation, a downward set pleasure\r\nand cordiality. The more they scowled the more we smiled and everybody\r\nwas very happy about the potential flowering of transgalactic culture\r\nthat we were instituting.\r\n\r\nWhen we turned onto the magnificent superhighway, however, Hacker\r\nbecame furious. He kept trying to pull over to the right but a steady\r\nstream of scarab-shaped cars, filled with curious sightseers, kept\r\ngetting in his way.\r\n\r\n"This is crazy," he cried.\r\n\r\n"I think they drive on the left here," Dr. Barnes tried to explain.\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I mean--they\'re crazy!"\r\n\r\n"They did it that way in England for centuries," I said. "It took a\r\nlong time to get them to change."\r\n\r\n"Fine, fine." Suddenly he laughed, as if pleased with his capacity\r\nfor tolerance. "If it\'s good enough for them it\'s good enough for us\r\nvisitors. They sure know how to build beautiful roads!"\r\n\r\nI suppose I should have been pleased with this shift toward good\r\nhumor but I wasn\'t. I just could not like the youngster. He had been\r\nforgivably cocky for his age before, but now something nasty had been\r\nadded.\r\n\r\nStill, he remained on his best behavior as we approached Crona, the\r\ncapital city. Its golden towers gleamed in the sun and everywhere there\r\nwere crowds of beautiful tan people, waving to us and happily scowling\r\ntheir welcome.\r\n\r\nThe lead cars stopped before a particularly elegant skyscraper that was\r\nset in the middle of vast, symmetrical gardens. We got out and were\r\ngreeted by dignitaries accompanied by technicians with Semanticizing\r\nequipment. (If this equipment worked slowly, it was still faster than\r\nany we\'d developed.) The men who came toward us were puzzled when we\r\nextended our hands but, once the translation came through and they\r\nunderstood it was an Earth custom, they copied our gesture. Only they\r\nall put out their left hands. It took a while before reasonable contact\r\ncould be made.\r\n\r\n"Interesting," said Dr. Barnes. "They all seem to be left-handed."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see what\'s so interesting about that," Hacker snorted through\r\nhis puggish nose. "I\'ve seen left-handed people on Earth."\r\n\r\n"Good for you," the doctor answered drily.\r\n\r\nHacker looked a little annoyed but for once managed to keep quiet.\r\n\r\nI explained to the receiving delegation how hyper-radio contact could\r\nbe established with our system for information exchanges and then told\r\nthem tomorrow\'s group from _Terra I_ would be much larger. It would\r\nbe in a position to set out the technical arrangements in all the\r\nnecessary detail.\r\n\r\nThe dialogue crept along as translations were made, but finally an\r\nespecially regal figure stepped forward and told us the rest of the\r\nproceedings would take place within the building. We followed the\r\nNewtaneans into a hall so vast that we still seemed to be outdoors.\r\nSubtle colors were playing free-form patterns on the walls and the\r\nsynesthetic reaction was that of hearing a music too beautiful, too\r\nperfect, for the relative crudity of the human ear to grasp alone.\r\n"This," Hacker laughed, "is my idea of heaven!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI wasn\'t about to unbend and openly agree with him on anything. 

But\r\ncelestial it really was. And then the subtly rich smells of the food\r\nbegan to play on our nostrils. It was brought out on great automatic\r\nservers and robot arms set heaping, steaming plates before the fifty\r\nNewtaneans. We, of course, had to refuse, taking out our compacted\r\nrations and setting them before us.\r\n\r\nAll the Newtaneans were still meat-eaters. The main course was a small\r\nfowl, thoroughly browned in gravy. For me the most interesting thing\r\nabout it was that four drumstick legs stuck out of each torso rather\r\nthan the regulation two found on all earth-based birds. For Hacker,\r\nthough, a more practical matter was involved.\r\n\r\n"I\'d sure like to try a helping of that bird," he said.\r\n\r\nThe two of us, naturally, were shocked. "That must have been a living\r\ncreature once," said Barnes.\r\n\r\n"So what?"\r\n\r\n"Well, our civilization is essentially vegetarian. They just haven\'t\r\nreached our level as yet in that respect.

"\r\n\r\n"Nuts loaf to you!" Hacker snapped. "And synthetic yeast pie too! I\'ve\r\neaten flesh.

"\r\n\r\nThat _really_ upset me. I know there\'s still a little surreptitious\r\nmeat-consumption on Earth--genetics shows we must get a few throwbacks\r\nin every generation--but I\'d never before met anyone who openly boasted\r\nabout it. Synthetic foods meet gourmet needs better than traditional\r\nones do anyway. (Of course, I don\'t mean the dull compacted stuff\r\nwe get on long space hops but the food served on Terran planets\r\nthemselves.) Any Earthman eating flesh back home is deliberately trying\r\nto taste the atavistic sensations of savagery.\r\n\r\n"You know how immoral that is," I told him.\r\n\r\n"Hacker, let\'s forget the moral issue," Barnes said, considering him\r\nwith disgust. "Let\'s just be sensible. 

We don\'t know enough about\r\nNewtane yet to eat _anything_."\r\n\r\nHacker laughed. "Why, it smells just like our own food, only better."\r\nHe picked at his vita-concentrate. "Oh, let\'s forget about the whole\r\nthing.

"\r\n\r\nWe tried to. Several dignitaries rose to their full seven feet and\r\nspoke slowly into Semanticizers, flinging their queer hands out for\r\nemphasis with their thumbs waving where our pinkies do. Suddenly,\r\nthough, Hacker got up from his seat and hurried down the long table to\r\nthe place where the leading spokesman was eating. He leaned over him,\r\nspeaking into the nearest translator, and I could see the Newtanean\r\nsmiling broadly, as if trying to refuse something, while Hacker\r\nfrowned. Finally the smile faded into a friendly scowl. Nothing good\r\ncould be coming out of this.\r\n\r\nA minute later a robot arm proffered a loaded plate to Hacker and he\r\nstarted back to us with it. Barnes rose to stop him, but before Hacker\r\nreached us he had taken two mouthfuls of the meat.\r\n\r\nI have never seen such sheer self-satisfied delight on a human face as\r\nafter those first bites.\r\n\r\n"You shouldn\'t be doing that," Barnes said when he sat down next to us\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"You\'re just old fogies," Hacker grunted through a meat-stuffed mouth.\r\n"This is the best food I\'ve ever eaten."\r\n\r\nHe somehow shoveled another load of meat between his lips.\r\n\r\nThirty seconds later his face twisted into a caricature of the human\r\nphysiognomy, all writhing lines, as if every muscle were breaking loose\r\nfrom its neighbors. The last unswallowed portion of food erupted from\r\nhis mouth and he fell forward into the vile mess.\r\n\r\nHe was dead.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPandemonium spread through the hall. Everywhere wildly smiling faces\r\nexpressed despair at such an end for an honored guest. Barnes sprang\r\ninto action, pulling the portable medical kit from his belt and\r\nimmediately starting blood tests while some native doctors joined him\r\nwith their emergency equipment. "Must start revitalizing immediately,"\r\nhe said, then stopped, ashen-faced, as he studied an analyzer tube.\r\n"Fantastic! No, it can\'t be!"\r\n\r\nThe Newtaneans were equally bewildered. They rushed Hacker to a nearby\r\ntreatment chamber. All I could do was wait, while the Newtanean leader\r\nexplained that Hacker had told him we had authorized his trying the\r\nfood. There was no need to doubt his story. 

It was just what the\r\nkid would have done. I did my best to assure him that we knew his\r\nintentions had been honorable.\r\n\r\nA half-hour later Barnes returned, a robot platform following with\r\nHacker, body covered by a preservative glaze, on it.\r\n\r\n"Nothing can be done," he said. "I\'ve tried everything. Hacker\'s too\r\nthoroughly dead for anything ever to bring him back. We\'ll just have to\r\ntake his body home for further study."\r\n\r\n"But what killed him?" I demanded.\r\n\r\n"A dozen or so things out of a thousand possibilities."\r\n\r\n"You mean you don\'t have any idea?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I have _some_ idea. Too many ideas in fact. Look, Johnson,\r\nchemistry\'s not your specialty but this is fairly elementary. All life\r\ncontains protein, right?"\r\n\r\n"Right."\r\n\r\n"And all protein consists of amino acids. _Every_ natural protein\r\nback home is built on levo--left turn--amino acids. Here it is just\r\nthe opposite, the mirror image of what we know. Every amino acid is\r\ndextro--to the right!"\r\n\r\n"But how can it be different here?"\r\n\r\n"Johnson, they could ask the same question about us with equal\r\njustification--or, rather, equal lack of justification."\r\n\r\nI was trying to feel my way through the confusion. "Barnes, I know a\r\nworld could be made of anti-matter but--"\r\n\r\n"No, no. Anti-matter is a reversal of changes within the atom.\r\nThese atoms are the same as ours. It\'s the organization that is\r\ndifferent--regular molecules with a different twist."\r\n\r\n"But why should it have killed him then? We absorb starch and reject\r\ncellulose which is closely related. But the body just refuses to accept\r\nthe cellulose. It doesn\'t necessarily go ahead and die."\r\n\r\n"Starch and cellulose are both dextro, old man. This is a more\r\nfundamental difference. 

Maybe the body just throws off some of these\r\ncompounds too. But there were some--plenty, I suspect--it couldn\'t\r\nthrow off." He glanced toward the stiffening corpse, sympathetically.\r\n\r\n"The poor kid couldn\'t leave well enough alone."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWell, we are two universal days out from Newtane and soon we will drop\r\nfrom hyper-drive as we reach the orbit of Pluto. I shouldn\'t still\r\nbe feeling as uneasy as I do. 

I\'m sure I shouldn\'t. We have had five\r\nfriendly, informative days with the people of a great civilization\r\nremarkably like ours, and President Hacker has radioed he understands\r\nperfectly that we were not responsible for the tragedy, nobody was. The\r\nkid, it seems, wasn\'t the apple of his eye anyway.\r\n\r\nNinety men and one corpse returning to the security of _terra firma_.\r\nI should, when all is said and done, be happy with the way most things\r\nhave worked out. But I am a Chronicler and I know the peculiarly\r\nsymbolic, seemingly superficial ways in which history manages to repeat\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nIt is more than three centuries since the last war on Earth between\r\nrightists and leftists. That was a matter of differing concepts of\r\neconomics and politics. I can\'t help wondering, though, whether there\r\nare not even more fundamental points of eventual conflict in the\r\nuniverse that we have barely discovered. If there are, I\'m beginning\r\nto suspect they\'ll still have something to do with the unfathomable\r\ndifference between Right and Left, a difference that took many lives\r\ncenturies ago--and may not be through with us yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a small striped smelt called the grunion which has odd\r\negglaying habits. At high tide, on the second, third, and fourth nights\r\nafter the full of the moon from March to June, thousands of female\r\ngrunions ride in on the waves to a beach in southern California near\r\nSan Diego, dig tail-first into the soft sand, deposit their eggs, then\r\nride back on the wash of the next wave. The whole operation lasts about\r\nsix seconds.\r\n\r\nOn the nights when the grunion are running, hordes of people used to\r\ncome to the beach with baskets and other containers, and with torches\r\nto light the scene, and try to catch the elusive little fish in their\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nThey were doing that on an April night in 1960. In the midst of the\r\nexcitement of the chase, only a few of them noticed that something else\r\nwas riding the waves in with the grunions.\r\n\r\nAmong the few who stopped grunion-catching long enough to investigate\r\nwere a girl named Marge Hickin and a boy named Gene Towanda. They were\r\nUCLA students, "going together", who had come down on Saturday from Los\r\nAngeles for the fun.\r\n\r\n"What on earth do you think these can be, Gene?" Marge asked, holding\r\nout on her palms three or four of the little circular, wriggling\r\nobjects, looking like small-size doughnuts, pale straw in color.\r\n\r\n"Never saw anything like them," Gene admitted. "But then my major\'s\r\npsychology, not zoology. 

They don\'t seem to bite, anyway. Here let\'s\r\ncollect some of them instead of the fish. That dingus of yours will\r\nhold water. 

We can take them to the Marine Biology lab tomorrow and\r\nfind out what they are."\r\n\r\nMarge Hickin and Gene Towanda had started a world-wide economic\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\nNone of the scientists at the university laboratory knew what the\r\nlittle live straw-colored circles were, either. In fact, after a\r\npreliminary study they wouldn\'t say positively whether the creatures\r\nwere animal or vegetable; they displayed voluntary movement, but they\r\nseemed to have no respiratory or digestive organs. They were completely\r\nanomalous.\r\n\r\nThe grunion ran again that night, and Gene and Marge stayed down to\r\nhelp the laboratory assistants gather several hundred of the strange\r\nnew objects for further study. They were so numerous that they were\r\nswamping the fish, and the crowds at the beach began to grumble that\r\ntheir sport was being spoiled.\r\n\r\nNext night the grunion stopped running--but the little doughnuts\r\ndidn\'t. They never stopped. They came in by hundreds of thousands every\r\nnight, and those which nobody gathered wriggled their way over the land\r\nuntil some of them even turned up on the highways (where a lot of them\r\nwere smashed by automobiles), on the streets and sidewalks of La Jolla,\r\nand as far north as Oceanside and as far south as downtown San Diego\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThe things were becoming a pest. There were indignant letters to the\r\npapers, and editorials were written calling on the authorities to do\r\nsomething. 

Just what to do, nobody knew; the only way to kill the\r\ncircular little objects from the sea seemed to be to crush them--and\r\nthey were too abundant for that to be very effective.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the laboratory kept studying them.\r\n\r\nMarge and Gene were interested enough to come down again the next\r\nweekend to find out what, if anything, had been discovered. Not much\r\nhad: but one of the biochemists at the laboratory casually mentioned\r\nthat chemically the straw-colored circles seemed to be almost pure\r\nprotein, with some carbohydrates and fats, and that apparently they\r\ncontained all the essential vitamins.\r\n\r\nCollege student that he was, Gene Towanda immediately swallowed one of\r\nthe wriggling things down whole, as a joke.\r\n\r\nIt tickled a little, but that wasn\'t what caused the delighted\r\namazement on his face.\r\n\r\n"Gosh!" he exclaimed. 

"It\'s delicious!"\r\n\r\nHe swallowed another handful.\r\n\r\nThat was the beginning of the great _margene_ industry.\r\n\r\nIt was an astute reporter, getting a feature story on the sensational\r\nnew food find, who gave the creatures their name, in honor of the boy\r\nand girl who had first brought the things to the attention of the\r\nscientists. He dubbed them margenes, and margenes they remained.\r\n\r\n"Dr. O. Y. Willard, director of the laboratory," his story said in\r\npart, "thinks the margenes may be the answer to the increasing and\r\nalarming problem of malnutrition, especially in undeveloped countries.\r\n\r\n"\'For decades now,\' he said, \'scientists have been worried by the\r\ngrowing gap between world population and world food facilities.\r\nOver-farming, climatic changes caused by erosion and deforestation, the\r\nencroachment of building areas on agricultural land, and above all the\r\nunrestricted growth of population, greatest in the very places where\r\nfood is becoming scarcest and most expensive, have produced a situation\r\nwhere, if no remedy is found, starvation or semi-starvation may be the\r\nfate of half the Earth\'s people. The ultimate result would be the slow\r\ndegeneration and death of the entire human race.\r\n\r\n"\'Many remedies have been suggested,\' Dr. Willard commented further.\r\n\'They range from compulsory birth control to the production of\r\nsynthetic food, hydroponics, and the harvesting of plankton from the\r\noceans. Each of these presents almost insuperable difficulties.\r\n\r\n"\'The one ideal solution would be the discovery of some universal food\r\nthat would be nourishing, very cheap, plentiful, tasty, and that would\r\nnot violate the taboos of any people anywhere in the world. In the\r\nmargenes we may have discovered that food.\'\r\n\r\n"\'We don\'t know where the margenes came from,\' the director went on to\r\nsay, \'and we don\'t even know yet what they are, biologically speaking.\r\nWhat we do know is that they provide more energy per gram than any\r\nother edible product known to man, that everyone who has eaten them\r\nis enthusiastic about their taste, that they can be processed and\r\ndistributed easily and cheaply, and that they are acceptable even to\r\nthose who have religious or other objections to certain other foods,\r\nsuch as beef, among the Hindus or pork among the Jews and Mohammedans.\r\n\r\n"\'Even vegetarians can eat them,\' Dr. Willard remarked, \'since they are\r\ndecidedly not animal in nature. Neither, I may add, are they vegetable.\r\nThey are a hitherto utterly unknown synthesis of chemical elements in\r\nliving form. Their origin remains undiscovered.\'"\r\n\r\nNaturally, there was no thought of feeding people on raw margenes.\r\nOnly a few isolated places in either hemisphere would have found live\r\nfood agreeable. Experiment showed that the most satisfactory way to\r\nprepare them was to boil them alive, like crabs or lobsters. They could\r\nthen be ground and pressed into cakes, cut into convenient portions.\r\nOne one-inch-square cube made a nourishing and delicious meal for a\r\nsedentary adult, two for a man engaged in hard physical labor.\r\n\r\nAnd they kept coming in from the Pacific Ocean nightly, by the million.\r\n\r\nBy this time none of them had to be swept off streets or highways. The\r\nbeach where for nearly a century throngs had gathered for the sport of\r\ncatching grunion was off bounds now; it was the property of California\r\nMargene, Inc., a private corporation heavily subsidized by the Federal\r\nGovernment as an infant industry. The grunions themselves had to find\r\nanother place to lay their eggs, or die off--nobody cared which. The\r\nsand they had used for countless millennia as an incubator was hemmed\r\nin by factory buildings and trampled by margene-gatherers. The whole\r\nbeautiful shore for miles around was devastated; the university had\r\nto move its marine biological laboratory elsewhere; La Jolla, once a\r\ndelightful suburb and tourist attraction, had become a dirty, noisy\r\nhonkytonk town where processing and cannery workers lived and spent\r\ntheir off-hours; the unique Torrey Pines had been chopped down because\r\nthey interfered with the erection of a freight airport.\r\n\r\nBut half the world\'s people were living on margenes.\r\n\r\nThe sole possession of this wonderful foodstuff gave more power to\r\nthe United States than had priority in the atomic bomb. Only behind\r\nthe Iron Curtain did the product of California Margene, Inc. fail\r\nto penetrate. _Pravda_ ran parallel articles on the same day, one\r\nclaiming that margenes--_brzdichnoya_--had first appeared long ago on a\r\nbeach of the Caspian Sea and had for years formed most of the Russian\r\ndiet; the other warning the deluded nations receiving free supplies as\r\npart of American foreign aid that the margenes had been injected with\r\ndrugs aimed at making them weak and submissive to the exploitation of\r\nthe capitalist-imperialists.\r\n\r\nThere was a dangerous moment at the beginning when the sudden sharp\r\ndecline in stocks of all other food products threatened another 1929.\r\nBut with federal aid a financial crash was averted and now a new high\r\nlevel of prosperity had been established. Technological unemployment\r\nwas brief, and most of the displaced workers were soon retained for\r\njobs in one of the many ramifications of the new margene industry.\r\n\r\nAgriculture, of course, underwent a short deep depression, not only in\r\nAmerica but all over the world; but it came to an end as food other\r\nthan margenes quickly became a luxury product. Farmers were able to cut\r\ntheir production to a small fraction of the former yield, and to get\r\nrich on the dizzying prices offered for bread, apples, or potatoes.\r\nAnd this increased the prosperity of the baking and other related\r\nindustries as well.\r\n\r\nIn fact, ordinary food costs (which meant margene costs) were so low\r\nthat a number of the larger unions voluntarily asked for wage decreases\r\nin their next contracts. California Margene, Inc. was able to process,\r\npack, and distribute margene cakes at an infinitesimal retail price,\r\nby reason of the magnitude of the output.\r\n\r\nAn era of political good feeling fell upon the western world, reflected\r\nfrom the well-fed comfort of vast populations whose members never\r\nbefore in their lives had had quite enough to eat. The fear of famine\r\nseemed to be over forever, and with it the fear of the diseases and the\r\nsocial unrest that follow famine. 

Even the U.S.S.R. 

and its satellites,\r\nin a conciliatory move in the United Nations Assembly, suggested that\r\nthe long cold war ought to be amenable to a reasonable solution through\r\na series of amicable discussions. The western nations, assenting,\r\nguessed shrewdly that the Iron Curtain countries "wanted in" on the\r\nmargenes.\r\n\r\nMarge Hickin and Gene Towanda, who had started it all, left college\r\nfor copywriting jobs with the agency handling the enormous margene\r\npublicity; they were married a few months later.\r\n\r\nAnd the margenes continued to come in from the sea in countless\r\nmillions. They were being harvested now from the Pacific itself, near\r\nthe shoreline, before they reached the beach. Still no research could\r\ndiscover their original source.\r\n\r\nOnly a few scientists worried about what would happen if the margenes\r\nshould disappear as suddenly as they had arrived. Attempts at breeding\r\nthe creatures had failed completely. They did not undergo fission,\r\nthey did not sporulate, they seemed to have no sex. No methods of\r\nreproduction known in the plant or animal kingdom seemed to apply\r\nto them. Hundreds of them were kept alive for long periods--they\r\nlived with equal ease in either air or water, and they did not take\r\nnourishment, unless they absorbed it from their environment--but no\r\nsign of fertility ever appeared. Neither did they seem to die of\r\nnatural causes. They just kept coming in....\r\n\r\nOn the night of May 7, 1969, not a single margene was visible in the\r\nocean or on the beach.\r\n\r\nThey never came again.\r\n\r\nWhat happened as a result is known to every student of history. The\r\nworld-wide economic collapse, followed by the fall of the most stable\r\ngovernments, the huge riots that arose from the frantic attempts to\r\nget possession of the existing stocks of margene cakes or of the\r\nrare luxury items of other edibles, the announcement by the U.S.S.R.\r\nthat it had known from the beginning the whole thing was a gigantic\r\nAmerican hoax in the interests of the imperialistic bloodsuckers,\r\nthe simultaneous atomic attacks by east and west, the Short War of\r\n1970 that ruined most of what bombs had spared of the Earth, the slow\r\nstruggle back of the remnant of civilization which is all of existence\r\nyou and I have ever known--all these were a direct outgrowth of that\r\nfirst appearance of the margenes on the beach near San Diego on an\r\nApril night in 1960.\r\n\r\nMarge and Gene Towanda were divorced soon after they had both lost\r\ntheir jobs. She was killed in the hydrogen blast that wiped out San\r\nDiego; he fell in the War of 1970. "Margene" became a dirty word\r\nin every language on Earth. What small amount of money and ability\r\ncan be spared is, as everyone knows, devoted today to a desperate\r\ninternational effort to reach and colonize another habitable planet of\r\nthe Solar System, if such there be.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs for the margenes, themselves, out of the untold millions that had\r\ncome, only a few thousand were lucky enough to survive and find their\r\nway back to their overcrowded starting-point. In their strange way of\r\ncommunication--as incomprehensible to us as would be their means of\r\nnourishment and reproduction, or their constitution itself--they made\r\nknown to their kin what had happened to them. There is no possibility,\r\nin spite of the terrific over-population of their original home and of\r\nthe others to which they are constantly migrating, that they will ever\r\ncome here again.\r\n\r\nThere has been much speculation, particularly among writers of science\r\nfiction, on what would happen if aliens from other planets should\r\ninvade Earth. Would they arrive as benefactors or as conquerors? Would\r\nwe welcome them or would we overcome and capture them and put them in\r\nzoos and museums? Would we meet them in friendship or with hostility?\r\n\r\nThe margenes gave us the answer.\r\n\r\nBeings from outer space came to Earth in 1960.\r\n\r\nAnd we ate them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             The humblest events sometimes result from the\r\n            most grandiose beginnings. You\'d never imagine\r\n             space travel starting this way, for instance!\r\n\r\n\r\nI suppose there\'s a guy like McCleary in every office.\r\n\r\nNow I\'m not a hard man to get along with and it usually takes quite a\r\nbit more than overly bright remarks from the office boy to bother me.\r\nBut try as I might, I could never get along with McCleary. To be as\r\ndisliked as he was, you have to work at it.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of guy was he? Well, if you came down to the office one day\r\nproud as Punch because of something little Johnny or Josephine had\r\nsaid, it was a sure cinch that McCleary would horn in with something\r\nhis little Louie had spouted off that morning. At any rate, when\r\nMcCleary got through, you felt like taking Johnny to the doctor to find\r\nout what made him subnormal.\r\n\r\nOr maybe you happened to buy a new Super-eight that week and were\r\nbragging about the mileage, the terrific pickup, and how quickly she\r\nresponded to the wheel. Leave it to McCleary to give a quick run-down\r\non his own car that would make you feel like selling yours for junk at\r\nthe nearest scrap heap.\r\n\r\nWell, you see what I mean.\r\n\r\nBut by far the worst of it was when vacation time rolled around. You\r\ncould forgive a guy for topping you about how brainy his kids are, and\r\nyou might even find it in your heart to forget the terrific bargain he\r\ndrove to work in. But vacation time was when he\'d really get on your\r\nnerves. _You_ could pack the wife and kids in Old Reliable and roll out\r\nto the lake for your two weeks in August. You might even break the bank\r\nand spend the two weeks at a poor man\'s Sun Valley. But no matter where\r\nyou went, when you came back, you\'d have to sit in silence and listen\r\nto McCleary\'s account of his Vacation in the Adirondacks, or his Tramp\r\nin the Canadian Wilds, or maybe even the Old French Quarter.\r\n\r\nThe trouble was he always had the photographs, the ticket stubs, and\r\nthe souvenirs to prove it. Where he got the money, I\'ll never know.\r\nSometimes I\'d tell the wife about it and she\'d sniff and wonder what\r\nkind of shabby house they lived in that they could afford all the other\r\nthings. I never looked him up myself. Tell you the truth, I was afraid\r\nI\'d find the McClearys lived on Park Avenue.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow you look forward to a vacation all year, but particularly during\r\nthe latter part of July, when, what with the heat and the stuffy\r\noffice, you begin to feel like a half-done hotdog at a barbecue. I was\r\nfeeling even worse than usual as I was faced with spending my two weeks\r\nin my own backyard, most of my vacation dough having gone to pay the\r\ndoctor. The only thing I minded was having McCleary find out about it\r\nand seeing that phony look of sympathy roll across his fat face while\r\nhe rambled on about the vacation _he_ was going to have.\r\n\r\nIt was lunch time and we had just finished talking about the latest on\r\ntelevision and what was wrong with the Administration and who\'d win the\r\npennant when Bob Young brought up the subject of vacations. It turned\r\nout he was due for a trip to the Ozarks and Donley was going after\r\nwall-eye pike in northern Wisconsin. I could sense McCleary prick up\r\nhis ears clear across the room.\r\n\r\n"How about you, Bill?" Donley asked me. "Got any plans?"\r\n\r\nI winked heavily and jerked a thumb warningly toward McCleary, making\r\nsure McCleary couldn\'t see the gesture.\r\n\r\n"My vacation is really going to be out of the world this time," I said.\r\n"Me and the wife are going to Mars. Dry, you know. Even better than\r\nArizona for her sinus."\r\n\r\nEven with the wink they were caught off guard for a minute.\r\n\r\n"Mars?" Donley said feebly, edging his chair away. "Yeah, sure. 

Great\r\nplace. Never been there myself, though.

"\r\n\r\nYoung just gaped, then grinned as he caught on. "I understand it\'s a\r\nwonderful spot," he chipped in.\r\n\r\nI casually peeled a hard-boiled egg the wife had packed in my lunch\r\nbucket and leaned back in my swivel chair. "It\'s really swell," I said\r\ndreamily, but loud enough so McCleary couldn\'t help but overhear.\r\n"Drifting down the Grand Canal at evening, the sun a faint golden disk\r\nbehind the crystal towers of Marsport...." I let my voice drift into a\r\nlong sigh and reached for Donley\'s sack of grapes.\r\n\r\nAbout this time McCleary had gnawed his way through a big pastrami\r\nsandwich and waddled over. He stood there expectantly, but we carefully\r\nignored him.\r\n\r\n"Always wanted to go myself," Donley said in the same tone of voice he\r\nwould have used to say he\'d like to go to California someday. "Pretty\r\nexpensive, though, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Expensive?" 

I raised a studiedly surprised eyebrow. "Oh, I suppose\r\na little, but it\'s worth it. The wife and I got a roomette on the\r\n_Princess of Mars_ for $139.50. That\'s one way, of course."\r\n\r\n"Mars!" Young sighed wistfully.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of silence, with all three of us paying silent\r\ntribute to the ultimate in vacations. McCleary slowly masticated a leaf\r\nof lettuce, his initial look of suspicion giving way to half-belief.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s hear some more about it," Young said enthusiastically, suddenly\r\nrecovering from his reverie.\r\n\r\n"Oh, there isn\'t much more," I said indifferently. "We plan to stay at\r\nthe Redsands hotel in Marsport--American plan. Take in Marsport, with\r\nmaybe a side trip to Crystallite. If we have time we might even take a\r\nwaterway cruise to the North Pole...."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI broke off and dug Donley in the ribs.\r\n\r\n"Man, you never fished until you have a Martian flying fish at the end\r\nof the line!" I grabbed a ruler off the desk and began using it as an\r\nimaginary rod and reel. "Talk about fight ... oh, sorry, Mac." My ruler\r\nhad amputated part of a floppy lettuce leaf that hung from McCleary\'s\r\nsandwich.\r\n\r\nI settled down in my chair again and started paying attention to my\r\nlunch. "Nothing like it," I added between mouthfuls of liverwurst.\r\n\r\n"How about entertainment?" Young winked slyly.\r\n\r\n"Well, you know--the wife will be along," I said. "But some of the\r\nplaces near the Grand Canal--and those Martian Mist Maidens! Brother,\r\nif I was unattached...."\r\n\r\n"There ain\'t any life on Mars," McCleary said, suspicious again.\r\n\r\nAll three of us looked at him in shocked silence.\r\n\r\n"He says there\'s no life on Mars!" Donley repeated.\r\n\r\n"You ever been there, McCleary?" I asked sarcastically.\r\n\r\n"No, but just the same...."\r\n\r\n"All right," I cut in, "then you don\'t know whether there is or isn\'t.\r\nSo kindly reserve your opinion until you know a little about the\r\nsubject under discussion."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI turned back to Donley and Young.\r\n\r\n"Really a wonderful place for your health. Dry, thin air, nice and cool\r\nat night. 

And beautiful! From Marsport you can see low-slung mountains\r\nin the distance, dunes of soft, red sand stretching out to them. If\r\nI were you, Bob, I\'d forget all about the Ozarks and sign up on the\r\nrocket."\r\n\r\n"There ain\'t any rockets going to Mars," McCleary said obstinately.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t," I corrected. "I mean, there is. Besides, McCleary, just\r\nbecause you never heard of something doesn\'t mean it doesn\'t exist."\r\n\r\n"The government\'s still working on V-2," McCleary said flatly. "They\r\nhaven\'t even reached the moon yet."\r\n\r\nI sighed softly, acting disgusted at having to deal with somebody as\r\nstupid as McCleary. "Mac, that\'s the government and besides they\'re\r\ndealing with military rockets. And did you ever hear of the government\r\nperfecting something before private industry? Who perfected the\r\ntelephone, the radio, television? The government? 

No, private industry,\r\nof course! Private industry has always been ahead of the government on\r\neverything, including rockets. Get on the stick, Mac."\r\n\r\nMcCleary started in on his lettuce leaf again, looking very shrewd.\r\n\r\n"How come I never heard of it before now?" he asked, springing the\r\nclincher argument.\r\n\r\n"Look, Mac, this is relatively new. The company\'s just starting, can\'t\r\nafford to take full-page ads and that sort of thing. Just give \'em\r\ntime, that\'s all. Why, a couple of years from now you\'ll be spending\r\nyour vacation on Venus or Jupiter or some place like that. From now on\r\nCalifornia and the Bahamas will be strictly old hat."\r\n\r\nMcCleary looked half-believing.\r\n\r\n"Where\'d you get your tickets?"\r\n\r\nI waved vaguely in the direction of downtown. "Oh, there must be at\r\nleast a couple of agencies downtown. Might even be able to find them in\r\nthe phone book. Look under _Interplanetary Rocket Lines_ or something\r\nlike that. You might have a little difficulty, of course. 

Like I say,\r\nthey\'re not too well advertised."\r\n\r\nMcCleary was about to say something more, but then the one o\'clock bell\r\nrang and we went back to the office grind.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWell, McCleary didn\'t say anything more about it the next day, even\r\nthough we\'d throw in a chance comment about Mars every now and then, as\r\nif it were the most natural thing in the world, but Mac didn\'t rise to\r\nthe bait. We gradually forgot about it.\r\n\r\nThe next couple of weeks came and went and then my two weeks in August.\r\nLike I said before, my vacation dough had gone to pay the doctor, so I\r\nstayed at home and watered the begonias.\r\n\r\nThe Monday morning after vacation, we were all back in the office, if\r\nanything looking more fagged than we had when we left. When lunch time\r\nrolled around, Donley and Young and I piled our lunches on Donley\'s\r\ndesk--his desk was near a window on the north side of the building\r\nso we could get the breeze--and talked about what we had done during\r\nvacation.\r\n\r\nMcCleary ambled up and like it usually does after McCleary comes\r\naround, the conversation just naturally died down. After a two minute\r\nsilence I finally took the hook.\r\n\r\n"Okay, Mac," I said, "I know you\'re just dying to tell us. Where did\r\nyou go?

"\r\n\r\nHe almost looked surprised. "To Mars," he said, like he might have said\r\nAunt Minnie\'s.\r\n\r\nThe three of us looked blank for a minute and then we caught on. It\r\ntook us a while to recover from laughing and my sides were still aching\r\nwhen I saw McCleary\'s face. It definitely had a hurt look on it.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t think I did," he accused us.\r\n\r\n"Oh, come off it, McCleary," I said crossly. "A gag\'s a gag, but it can\r\nbe carried too far. Where\'d you go? 

California, Oregon, some place like\r\nthat?"\r\n\r\n"I said I went to Mars," McCleary repeated hotly, "and I can prove it!"\r\n\r\n"Sure," I said. "Like I can prove the world\'s flat and it\'s supported\r\nby four elephants standing on a turtle\'s back like the old Greeks...."\r\n\r\nI cut off. McCleary had thrown a couple of pasteboards on the desk and\r\nI picked them up. The printing on it was like you see on a Pullman\r\nticket. It said something about a roomette, first-class passage on the\r\n_Martian Prince_, for $154.75, and there was even a place where they\r\nhad the tax figured. In two blanks at the top of the ticket, they had\r\nit filled out to _E. 

C. McCleary and wife_. The bottom half was torn\r\noff, just like they do with train tickets.\r\n\r\n"Very clever," I said, "but you shouldn\'t have gone to all that trouble\r\nto have these printed up."\r\n\r\nMcCleary scowled and dropped a little bunch of kodachrome slides on the\r\ndesk. 

I took one and held it up to the light. It showed Mac and his\r\nwife mounted on something that looked like a cross between a camel and\r\na zebra. They were at the top of a sand dune and in the distance you\r\ncould see the towers of a city. The funny thing was the towers looked a\r\nlittle--but not much--like minarets and the sand dunes were colored a\r\nbeautiful pink.\r\n\r\nI passed it on to Donley and Young and started leafing through the\r\nrest. They were beautiful slides. McCleary and spouse in front of\r\nvarious structures in a delicately tinted marble and crystal city.\r\nMcCleary in a pink-and-black boat on a canal that looked as wide as the\r\nMississippi. McCleary standing on a strangely carved sandstone parapet,\r\nadmiring a sunset caused by a sun looking half as big as ours. And\r\neverywhere were the dunes of pink sand.\r\n\r\n"Pictures can be faked, Mac," I said.\r\n\r\nHe looked hurt and got some things out of his desk--a sateen pillow\r\nwith scenes like those on his snapshots, an urn filled with pink sand,\r\na tiny boat like a gondola, only different, a letter opener made out\r\nof peculiar bubbly pink glass. They were all stamped "Souvenir of\r\nMars" and that kind of junk you don\'t have made up for a gag. I know\r\nmass-produced articles when I see them.\r\n\r\n"We couldn\'t afford the first-class tour," McCleary said expansively,\r\n"but I figure we can cover that next year." He turned to me puzzledly.\r\n"I asked the passenger agent about the _Princess of Mars_ and he said\r\nhe had never heard of the ship. And it\'s Mars City, not Marsport.\r\nCouldn\'t understand how you made a mistake."\r\n\r\n"It was easy," I said weakly. I pointed to the pasteboard ducats.\r\n"Where\'d you get these, Mac?"\r\n\r\nHe waved generously in the direction of downtown. "Like you said,\r\nthere\'s a couple of agencies downtown...."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYou know, sometimes I think we misjudged McCleary. It takes a while to\r\nget to know a guy like Mac. Maybe his Louie _is_ brighter than Johnny,\r\nand maybe his chugmobile _is_ something terrific.\r\n\r\nFor the last few years, all on account of Mac, my two weeks in August\r\nhave really been well spent Beautiful! Why, from Mars City you can\r\nsee low-slung mountains in the distance and dunes of soft, red sand\r\nstretching out to them. And the sunsets when you\'re standing on the\r\nparapets of that delicate crystal city.... And, man, fishing in the\r\nGrand Canal....\r\n\r\nHow do you get to Mars? There\'s probably a couple of agencies in your\r\nown town. You can look them up in your phone book under "Vacation at\r\nthe Planets of Pleasure" or something like that. They might be a little\r\ndifficult to find, though.\r\n\r\nYou see, they\'re not very well advertised yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s Two Weeks in August, by Frank M. Robinson\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


You just give \'em the story.

"\r\n\r\n"Yessir," I agree. But I don\'t like that crack about comic headlines.\r\n\r\n"And get some dope on the Solver," he growls as he stamps out. "Make it\r\nbrief."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWell, our files had plenty on the Solver, since it was a hot news item.\r\nThey claimed it could answer anything. It was a machine that covered an\r\nacre of floor and stood about thirty feet high--all full of wires and\r\nrelays and counters. Also there were tanks of stuff that the inventor\r\ncalled the bio-chemical conceptors. These tanks were hooked up with a\r\nmillion fine wires, from one tank to the next, and all tied in with\r\nelectronic tubes. It was a sort of super-brain.\r\n\r\nThe Solver was invented because the human brain is limited to a few\r\nconcepts at one time. Science needed a brain that could juggle a whole\r\nbunch of ideas simultaneously. And since the Solver was fed only facts,\r\nits multi-brain wasn\'t cluttered with useless junk.\r\n\r\nIt had taken months to build it--and a lot of dough. So the scientists\r\nweren\'t anxious to have it snitched from them by any politician like\r\nSassoon.\r\n\r\nI called up Professor Connor, the inventor, and told him who I was.\r\n\r\n"I have no comments for the press!" he says tartly. In the visiplate,\r\nhis beard was thrust forward so pugnaciously that it was all out of\r\nfocus and I had to peer through the brush in order to see his face.\r\n\r\n"Take it easy, Professor." I smiled suavely. 

"The Press is your best\r\nfriend. If you\'re getting a dirty deal we will tell the whole world\r\nabout it! Are you going to appeal the court decision?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," he says after a pause. 

"I am!" He strokes his beard so that it\r\nclears from the visiplate and I can see a fairly benign looking old\r\ngeezer. "I was only defeated on a technicality today. As inventor and\r\nowner of the Solver, my rights are patent."\r\n\r\n"How come Sassoon grabbed your gadget, Professor?"\r\n\r\n"The Solver is not a gadget!" he snaps. "It\'s a delicate machine--and\r\ndangerous! The man who controls it can solve any riddle, given time.\r\nTherefore, it should remain under scientific control. It belongs\r\nrightfully to the Science Department."\r\n\r\n"Yeah--but how about Sassoon?"\r\n\r\nThe professor\'s snort rattled the receiver.\r\n\r\n"Sassoon is already head of Geo-politics. The other departments of\r\ngovernment won\'t last long if Geo-politics controls the Solver. Sassoon\r\nis an unscrupulous bandit!" And the professor snapped off his set.\r\n\r\nMaybe he was right. In the news room it was no secret that Sassoon was\r\ngoing to be the Big Shot or bust. In fact, I had a dilly of a headline\r\nall cooked up for the day Sassoon seized the scepter.\r\n\r\nThe following morning, however, the news wasn\'t so funny. Professor\r\nConnor was going to see his lawyer that day. Here\'s the teletype copy:\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR CONNOR KILLED IN CRASH. CAR COLLIDES WITH CAB AT CORNER OF\r\n5TH AND GRAND. CONNOR\'S CORPSE CONSIGNED TO CREMATORY. ODDS 50 TO 1 ON\r\nSASSOON. AP.\r\n\r\nOld B. J. raised holy cain over that one!\r\n\r\n"Connor\'s corpse consigned to crematory!" he yowled. "One more crack\r\nlike that and you, Pennyweight, are fired!"\r\n\r\n"Pennyfeather," I correct B. J.\r\n\r\n"Featherweight, Pennyweather, Periwinkle!" he foams. 

"What\'s the odds!\r\nYou Featherbrain!"\r\n\r\nBefore I can answer, he\'s gone, slamming the door and blowing papers\r\noff my desk.\r\n\r\nWell, a couple of days later Sassoon announces that the Solver will be\r\nunveiled to the public with due ceremony, come Wednesday. The Science\r\nDepartment is invited to attend at the Solver Building. Which is very\r\nmagnanimous, considering that the Science Department paid for the\r\nbuilding and the Solver too!\r\n\r\n"Jellyfeather," says old B. J. "You go down and cover this unveiling."\r\n\r\nThat\'s how I came to witness the Joe Squeeb incident.\r\n\r\nI had a seat in the hall right down in front--just behind the\r\ndisgruntled-looking scientists. Maybe they had a right to feel that\r\nway, but they knew better than to ignore Sassoon\'s invitation. Sassoon\r\nwas very sensitive about such things as being snubbed. So they were all\r\nthere, sitting like a row of hungry blackbirds.\r\n\r\nUp on the platform, the chairman opened the proceedings with a nice\r\nlittle speech which safely said nothing, and then he handed over the\r\nmeeting to Sassoon.\r\n\r\nSassoon was a big, fat man with slick black hair and eyes that reminded\r\nme of old B. J.\'s. Fishy. Sassoon, however, put on the jolly act--big\r\nsmile and breezy manner, the "we\'re-all-one-big-family" touch.\r\n\r\nMost of the people fell for it, and gave him a laugh when he sprung\r\nhis warming-up joke. But the boys with the brains in front of me just\r\ngloomed. I saw Sassoon give them a quick once-over before he went on to\r\ndescribe the wonders of the Solver. He gave a pretty good speech, too,\r\nif you didn\'t know what was behind it.\r\n\r\n"Mankind," he finally ended, "will look back on this day as on the dawn\r\nof a new era. Posterity will bathe in the flow of a new wisdom that has\r\ncome from our hands!"\r\n\r\nThen he pulled a cord that opened a huge curtain behind him, and the\r\nSolver was unveiled. Appropriate oh\'s and ah\'s followed. 

It did look\r\nimpressive at that. Like a gigantic calculating machine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn front of it there was a wide platform with several desks. These\r\nwere occupied by attendants ready to feed data which the Solver might\r\nrequire. Each desk had a microphone for that purpose, and there was one\r\ngilded microphone near Sassoon. This one was for stating the question.\r\nA large loudspeaker was suspended high up to deliver the Solver\'s\r\nanswers.\r\n\r\nI once read that the ancient Greeks had a similar setup, called the\r\nDelphic Oracle. Only some fellow got the wrong answer once and blew the\r\nwhole works some way.\r\n\r\n"And now," Sassoon beamed on his audience, "we will demonstrate the\r\nSolver in action. Perhaps we should allow our scientific friends the\r\nhonor of asking it the first riddle. After all, we owe science a great\r\ndeal, ha-ha!"\r\n\r\nBut none of the savants made a move. Maybe they felt balky. However,\r\nSassoon was too smart to allow any awkward pauses.\r\n\r\n"But then, perhaps the honor should go to some less illustrious\r\nperson." His cold eyes had spotted the figure of a little man in\r\noveralls, standing in a half-open doorway. 

The little man leaned on a\r\nbroom. I found out later he was Joe Squeeb, the janitor of Solver Hall.\r\n\r\n"Since we must always remember our democratic traditions," Sassoon\'s\r\nvoice was slick as warm margarine, "I think our humblest worker should\r\nhave the great honor of asking the Solver its first public question.\r\nCome here--you!"\r\n\r\nThe janitor dropped his broom and turned to flee, but Sassoon\'s voice,\r\nwith just a slight grate to it, pinned him in his tracks like a\r\nmesmerized rabbit.\r\n\r\n"Come, come. You, with the broom. Step up here!"\r\n\r\nJoe Squeeb moved as if pulled by invisible chains. On the stage with\r\nSassoon, he blinked nervously at the audience. Then he suddenly\r\ngrinned, showing snaggy teeth, like a man who feels he\'s a goner.\r\nSassoon towered over him as they talked together for a moment before\r\nSassoon turned to face the audience again.\r\n\r\n"This, ah, gentleman, is Joe Squeeb, our janitor. He has agreed to try\r\nand stump the Solver, ha-ha!"\r\n\r\nSassoon\'s great hand smacked Squeeb on the back and nearly sent the\r\nlittle man sprawling into the row of stony-faced scientists.\r\n\r\n"And now, Mr. Squeeb--ask your question." Sassoon pushed him to the\r\ngilded microphone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "Ask it a question."]\r\n\r\nSqueeb\'s Adam\'s apple bobbed. He shuffled his feet and twisted his\r\nscrawny neck. I heard his panicky whisper to Sassoon.\r\n\r\n"What\'ll I ask it?"\r\n\r\n"Come, come!" Sassoon frowned heavily. "Don\'t jump around like that!\r\nAsk it some question in arithmetic. Or maybe you know all the answers,\r\nho-ho!"\r\n\r\nSqueeb rolled his eyes. I guess he wasn\'t used to thinking because he\r\nacted as if he was in pain. Then, suddenly, his face lighted up.\r\n\r\n"I got it," he said triumphantly. "I remember a problem that stuck all\r\nof us."\r\n\r\nEvidently he had dredged the depths of his mind for some long forgotten\r\nproblem of high school days.\r\n\r\n"All right." Sassoon switched on the control. "Ask it, man, and get it\r\nover!"\r\n\r\nSqueeb gulped, gave his waiting audience a last hopeless grin, and\r\ncleared his throat.\r\n\r\n"Exactly what is the area of a circle," he asked brightly, "with a\r\nradius of one inch?"\r\n\r\nBertrand, the great mathematician, sitting just in front of me, gave a\r\nsort of gasp. Then the raspy notes of the Solver squawked a reply.\r\n\r\n"The area of a circle with a radius of one inch is exactly--Three point\r\none, four, one, five--nine--two--six--"\r\n\r\nBertrand, the mathematician, had a notebook and pen out, scribbling as\r\nthe Solver announced the figures in a plodding monotone. He covered one\r\nline and started on the next.\r\n\r\nThe audience began to stir impatiently. 

This was not very entertaining.\r\nSassoon frowned, quickly smiled again.\r\n\r\n"How long does this go on?" he asked jocularly.\r\n\r\nOne of the desk attendants moved forward.\r\n\r\n"It\'ll be quite a long time," he said. "The answer has never been\r\ncompleted."\r\n\r\n"Oh--six-- --nine-- -- --five," the Solver intoned persistently.\r\n\r\n"Switch the blasted thing off!" Sassoon ordered irritably.\r\n\r\nThe Solver gurgled to silence.\r\n\r\n"Now." Sassoon cleared his throat. "We will ask it another question."\r\n\r\nThe same attendant coughed discreetly.\r\n\r\n"Just a minute, Mr. Sassoon," he said apologetically as the boss\r\nof Geo-politics swung around to face him. "The Solver is not purely\r\nmechanical, you know. The actual work is done by the bio-chemical cells\r\nand these cannot be reset to zero without discharging their concept\r\nenergy."\r\n\r\n"Huh?" Sassoon frowned at the interruption. "Well, discharge \'em!

"\r\n\r\n"That\'s the trouble, sir. A Solver cell is like a human brain cell,\r\nit must complete its function in order to relapse into inactivity.\r\nShutting off the Solver merely holds its processes in abeyance. When we\r\nswitch on the power again, the cells will continue where they left off\r\ntill their task is completed."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSassoon thought that one over.\r\n\r\n"Then switch it back on again. Let\'s get this over," he snapped, and\r\nturned to look for Joe Squeeb. But the janitor had discreetly faded.\r\nHis broom leaned, deserted, in the doorway. Squeeb wasn\'t so dumb as he\r\nlooked!\r\n\r\n"Nine-- --Six-- -- --Four--" The Solver was slowing down a little as\r\nthe calculations became more involved with unwieldy quotients. But\r\nthere was grim resolve in the metallic tone.\r\n\r\nI tapped Bertrand on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n"How long will this take?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Couldn\'t say." 

He smiled thinly. "We once wore out several machines\r\non that problem. Imagine a Joe Squeeb saving us from--" He stopped\r\nabruptly.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you tell the Solver some way that the present answer is close\r\nenough?"\r\n\r\nBertrand shook his head.\r\n\r\n"As you may recall, Joe Squeeb definitely asked for an exact answer.\r\nThe Solver will give it--regardless!"\r\n\r\n"Eight-- --one-- --two--" The Solver was beginning to sound labored.\r\nInside the great machine relays were madly racing.\r\n\r\n"I guess Joe Squeeb just lost a job," I murmured.\r\n\r\n"He has another job waiting for him." Bertrand almost grinned. "We need\r\nsomeone to dust our equipment--someone who knows enough not to monkey\r\nwith things. It\'ll really be a pension job."\r\n\r\nI looked at Sassoon. He appeared very unhappy. Not only had he made\r\na chump of himself, but it looked as if he\'d spiked his own guns by\r\ngumming up the Solver. He couldn\'t use the machine for his own ends and\r\nhe\'d have no excuse for stealing the next one to be built.\r\n\r\nWhen I left Solver Hall the machine was gurgling a number about\r\nevery twenty seconds and slowing down all the time. Sassoon had\r\nasked Bertrand to get busy and shut it up some way, and Bertrand was\r\ngently explaining to him that it was merely a matter of time--lots of\r\ntime--before the Solver would stop. Unless Sassoon wanted it torn apart.\r\n\r\nI sent out a teletype release to the waiting world. It read:\r\n\r\nSASSOON SUMMONS SCIENTISTS FOR SOLUTION AS SOLVER STRANGLES ON SQUARING\r\nOF CIRCLE. SASSOON SWEARS TO SILENCE SOLVER. ODDS 1,000,000 TO 1 ON\r\nSOLVER. AP.\r\n\r\nTen seconds after the release, old B. J. was at my desk. Red eyed!\r\n\r\n"Pinfeather," he roars, "you\'re fired!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s Pennyfeather," I retort. "And I quit two seconds before you\r\nspoke!"\r\n\r\n"All right, all right! 

Bunnyweather, then!" He clutches the edge of my\r\ndesk. "Only get out of my sight! 

Quick!"\r\n\r\nAnd that is Joe Squeeb\'s story. Right now he\'s working for swell wages\r\nat Science Hall. They all call him Joe and ask him all the time how\r\nis his family and how is his arthritis. He\'s even putting on a little\r\nweight.\r\n\r\nAs for old B. J.--I figure he\'ll come around to me, apologizing, some\r\nday. 

Unless apoplexy gets him first. I\'m just waiting while I write\r\nthese memoirs.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


But this vast distance did not mean that isolation could endure\r\nforever. Instruments within the ship intercepted radio broadcasts and,\r\nwithin the hour, early TV signals. Machines compiled dictionaries and\r\ngrammars and began translating the major languages. The history of the\r\nplanet was tabulated as facts became available.\r\n\r\nThe course of the ship changed slightly; it was not much out of the way\r\nto swing nearer Earth. For days the two within the ship listened and\r\nwatched with little comment. They had to decide soon.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve got to make or break," said the first alien.\r\n\r\n"You know what I\'m in favor of," said the second.\r\n\r\n"I can guess," said Ethaniel, who had spoken first. "The place is a\r\ncomplete mess. They\'ve never done anything except fight each other--and\r\ninvent better weapons."\r\n\r\n"It\'s not what they\'ve done," said Bal, the second alien. "It\'s what\r\nthey\'re going to do, with that big bomb."\r\n\r\n"The more reason for stopping," said Ethaniel. "The big bomb can destroy\r\nthem. Without our help they may do just that."\r\n\r\n"I may remind you that in two months twenty-nine days we\'re due in\r\nWillafours," said Bal. "Without looking at the charts I can tell you we\r\nstill have more than a hundred light-years to go."\r\n\r\n"A week," said Ethaniel. "We can spare a week and still get there on\r\ntime."\r\n\r\n"A week?" said Bal. "To settle their problems? They\'ve had two world\r\nwars in one generation and that the third and final one is coming up you\r\ncan\'t help feeling in everything they do."\r\n\r\n"It won\'t take much," said Ethaniel. "The wrong diplomatic move, or a\r\ntrigger-happy soldier could set it off. And it wouldn\'t have to be\r\ndeliberate. A meteor shower could pass over and their clumsy instruments\r\ncould interpret it as an all-out enemy attack."\r\n\r\n"Too bad," said Bal. "We\'ll just have to forget there ever was such a\r\nplanet as Earth."\r\n\r\n"Could you? 

Forget so many people?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m doing it," said Bal. "Just give them a little time and they won\'t\r\nbe here to remind me that I have a conscience."\r\n\r\n"My memory isn\'t convenient," said Ethaniel. "I ask you to look at\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBal rustled, flicking the screen intently. "Very much like ourselves,"\r\nhe said at last. "A bit shorter perhaps, and most certainly incomplete.\r\nExcept for the one thing they lack, and that\'s quite odd, they seem\r\nexactly like us. Is that what you wanted me to say?"\r\n\r\n"It is. The fact that they are an incomplete version of ourselves\r\ntouches me. They actually seem defenseless, though I suppose they\'re\r\nnot."\r\n\r\n"Tough," said Bal. "Nothing we can do about it."\r\n\r\n"There is. We can give them a week."\r\n\r\n"In a week we can\'t negate their entire history. We can\'t begin to undo\r\nthe effect of the big bomb."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t tell," said Ethaniel. 

"We can look things over."\r\n\r\n"And then what? How much authority do we have?"\r\n\r\n"Very little," conceded Ethaniel. "Two minor officials on the way to\r\nWillafours--and we run directly into a problem no one knew existed."\r\n\r\n"And when we get to Willafours we\'ll be busy. It will be a long time\r\nbefore anyone comes this way again."\r\n\r\n"A very long time. There\'s nothing in this region of space our people\r\nwant," said Ethaniel. "And how long can Earth last? Ten years? Even ten\r\nmonths? The tension is building by the hour."\r\n\r\n"What can I say?" 

said Bal. "I suppose we can stop and look them over.\r\nWe\'re not committing ourselves by looking."\r\n\r\nThey went much closer to Earth, not intending to commit themselves. For\r\na day they circled the planet, avoiding radar detection, which for them\r\nwas not difficult, testing, and sampling. Finally Ethaniel looked up\r\nfrom the monitor screen. "Any conclusions?"\r\n\r\n"What\'s there to think? It\'s worse than I imagined."\r\n\r\n"In what way?"\r\n\r\n"Well, we knew they had the big bomb. Atmospheric analysis showed that\r\nas far away as we were."\r\n\r\n"I know."\r\n\r\n"We also knew they could deliver the big bomb, presumably by some sort\r\nof aircraft."\r\n\r\n"That was almost a certainty. They\'d have no use for the big bomb\r\nwithout aircraft."\r\n\r\n"What\'s worse is that I now find they also have missiles, range one\r\nthousand miles and upward. They either have or are near a primitive form\r\nof space travel."\r\n\r\n"Bad," said Ethaniel. "Sitting there, wondering when it\'s going to hit\r\nthem. Nervousness could set it off."\r\n\r\n"It could, and the missiles make it worse," said Bal. "What did you find\r\nout at your end?

"\r\n\r\n"Nothing worthwhile. I was looking at the people while you were\r\ninvestigating their weapons."\r\n\r\n"You must think something.

"\r\n\r\n"I wish I knew what to think. There\'s so little time," Ethaniel said.\r\n"Language isn\'t the difficulty. Our machines translate their languages\r\neasily and I\'ve taken a cram course in two or three of them. But that\'s\r\nnot enough, looking at a few plays, listening to advertisements, music,\r\nand news bulletins. I should go down and live among them, read books,\r\ntalk to scholars, work with them, play."\r\n\r\n"You could do that and you\'d really get to know them. But that takes\r\ntime--and we don\'t have it.

"\r\n\r\n"I realize that."\r\n\r\n"A flat yes or no," said Bal.\r\n\r\n"No. We can\'t help them," said Ethaniel. "There is nothing we can do for\r\nthem--but we have to try."\r\n\r\n"Sure, I knew it before we started," said Bal. "It\'s happened before. We\r\ntake the trouble to find out what a people are like and when we can\'t\r\nhelp them we feel bad. It\'s going to be that way again." 

He rose and\r\nstretched. "Well, give me an hour to think of some way of going at it."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was longer than that before they met again. In the meantime the ship\r\nmoved much closer to Earth. They no longer needed instruments to see it.\r\nThe planet revolved outside the visionports. The southern plains were\r\ngreen, coursed with rivers; the oceans were blue; and much of the\r\nnorthern hemisphere was glistening white. Ragged clouds covered the\r\npole, and a dirty pall spread over the mid-regions of the north.\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t thought of anything brilliant," said Ethaniel.\r\n\r\n"Nor I," said Bal. "We\'re going to have to go down there cold. And it\r\nwill be cold."\r\n\r\n"Yes. It\'s their winter."\r\n\r\n"I did have an idea," said Bal. "What about going down as supernatural\r\nbeings?"\r\n\r\n"Hardly," said Ethaniel. "A hundred years ago it might have worked.\r\nToday they have satellites. They are not primitives."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you\'re right," said Bal. "I did think we ought to take\r\nadvantage of our physical differences."\r\n\r\n"If we could I\'d be all for it. But these people are rough and\r\ndesperate. They wouldn\'t be fooled by anything that crude."\r\n\r\n"Well, you\'re calling it," said Bal.\r\n\r\n"All right," said Ethaniel. "You take one side and I the other. We\'ll\r\ntell them bluntly what they\'ll have to do if they\'re going to survive,\r\nhow they can keep their planet in one piece so they can live on it."\r\n\r\n"That\'ll go over big. Advice is always popular."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t help it. That\'s all we have time for."\r\n\r\n"Special instructions?"\r\n\r\n"None. We leave the ship here and go down in separate landing craft. You\r\ncan talk with me any time you want to through our communications, but\r\ndon\'t unless you have to."\r\n\r\n"They can\'t intercept the beams we use."\r\n\r\n"They can\'t, and even if they did they wouldn\'t know what to do with our\r\nlanguage. I want them to think that we don\'t _need_ to talk things\r\nover."\r\n\r\n"I get it. Makes us seem better than we are. They think we know exactly\r\nwhat we\'re doing even though we don\'t."\r\n\r\n"If we\'re lucky they\'ll think that."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBal looked out of the port at the planet below. "It\'s going to be cold\r\nwhere I\'m going. You too. Sure we don\'t want to change our plans and\r\nland in the southern hemisphere? It\'s summer there."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid not. The great powers are in the north. They are the ones we\r\nhave to reach to do the job."\r\n\r\n"Yeah, but I was thinking of that holiday you mentioned. We\'ll be\r\nrunning straight into it. That won\'t help us any."\r\n\r\n"I know, they don\'t like their holidays interrupted. It can\'t be helped.\r\nWe can\'t wait until it\'s over."\r\n\r\n"I\'m aware of that," said Bal. "Fill me in on that holiday, anything I\r\nought to know. Probably religious in origin. 

That so?"\r\n\r\n"It was religious a long time ago," said Ethaniel. "I didn\'t learn\r\nanything exact from radio and TV. Now it seems to be chiefly a time for\r\neating, office parties, and selling merchandise.

"\r\n\r\n"I see. It has become a business holiday."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a good description. 

I didn\'t get as much of it as I ought to\r\nhave. I was busy studying the people, and they\'re hard to pin down.

"\r\n\r\n"I see. I was thinking there might be some way we could tie ourselves in\r\nwith this holiday. Make it work for us.

"\r\n\r\n"If there is I haven\'t thought of it."\r\n\r\n"You ought to know. You\'re running this one." Bal looked down at the\r\nplanet. Clouds were beginning to form at the twilight edge. "I hate to\r\ngo down and leave the ship up here with no one in it."\r\n\r\n"They can\'t touch it. No matter how they develop in the next hundred\r\nyears they still won\'t be able to get in or damage it in any way."\r\n\r\n"It\'s myself I\'m thinking about. 

Down there, alone."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be with you. On the other side of the Earth."\r\n\r\n"That\'s not very close. I\'d like it better if there were someone in the\r\nship to bring it down in a hurry if things get rough. They don\'t think\r\nmuch of each other. I don\'t imagine they\'ll like aliens any better."\r\n\r\n"They may be unfriendly," Ethaniel acknowledged. Now he switched a\r\nmonitor screen until he looked at the slope of a mountain. It was\r\nsnowing and men were cutting small green trees in the snow. "I\'ve\r\nthought of a trick.

"\r\n\r\n"If it saves my neck I\'m for it."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t guarantee anything," said Ethaniel. "This is what I was\r\nthinking of: instead of hiding the ship against the sun where there\'s\r\nlittle chance it will be seen, we\'ll make sure that they do see it.\r\nLet\'s take it around to the night side of the planet and light it up."\r\n\r\n"Say, pretty good," said Bal.\r\n\r\n"They can\'t imagine that we\'d light up an unmanned ship," said Ethaniel.\r\n"Even if the thought should occur to them they\'ll have no way of\r\nchecking it. Also, they won\'t be eager to harm us with our ship shining\r\ndown on them."\r\n\r\n"That\'s thinking," said Bal, moving to the controls. "I\'ll move the ship\r\nover where they can see it best and then I\'ll light it up. I\'ll really\r\nlight it up."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t spare power."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t worry about that. They\'ll see it. 

Everybody on Earth will see\r\nit." Later, with the ship in position, glowing against the darkness of\r\nspace, pulsating with light, Bal said: "You know, I feel better about\r\nthis. We may pull it off. Lighting the ship may be just the help we\r\nneed."\r\n\r\n"It\'s not we who need help, but the people of Earth," said Ethaniel.\r\n"See you in five days." With that he entered a small landing craft,\r\nwhich left a faintly luminescent trail as it plunged toward Earth. As\r\nsoon as it was safe to do so, Bal left in another craft, heading for the\r\nother side of the planet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd the spaceship circled Earth, unmanned, blazing and pulsing with\r\nlight. No star in the winter skies of the planet below could equal it in\r\nbrilliancy. Once a man-made satellite came near but it was dim and was\r\nlost sight of by the people below. During the day the ship was visible\r\nas a bright spot of light. At evening it seemed to burn through the\r\nsunset colors.\r\n\r\nAnd the ship circled on, bright, shining, seeming to be a little piece\r\nclipped from the center of a star and brought near Earth to illuminate\r\nit. Never, or seldom, had Earth seen anything like it.\r\n\r\nIn five days the two small landing craft that had left it arched up from\r\nEarth and joined the orbit of the large ship. The two small craft slid\r\ninside the large one and doors closed behind them. In a short time the\r\naliens met again.\r\n\r\n"We did it," said Bal exultantly as he came in. "I don\'t know how we did\r\nit and I thought we were going to fail but at the last minute they came\r\nthrough."\r\n\r\nEthaniel smiled. "I\'m tired," he said, rustling.\r\n\r\n"Me too, but mostly I\'m cold," said Bal, shivering. "Snow. Nothing but\r\nsnow wherever I went. Miserable climate. And yet you had me go out\r\nwalking after that first day."\r\n\r\n"From my own experience it seemed to be a good idea," said Ethaniel. "If\r\nI went out walking one day I noticed that the next day the officials\r\nwere much more cooperative. If it worked for me I thought it might help\r\nyou.

"\r\n\r\n"It did. I don\'t know why, but it did," said Bal. "Anyway, this\r\nagreement they made isn\'t the best but I think it will keep them from\r\ndestroying themselves."\r\n\r\n"It\'s as much as we can expect," said Ethaniel. "They may have small\r\nwars after this, but never the big one. In fifty or a hundred years we\r\ncan come back and see how much they\'ve learned."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not sure I want to," said Bal. "Say, what\'s an angel?"\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"When I went out walking people stopped to look. Some knelt in the snow\r\nand called me an angel."\r\n\r\n"Something like that happened to me," said Ethaniel.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t get it but I didn\'t let it upset me," said Bal. "I smiled at\r\nthem and went about my business." He shivered again. "It was always\r\ncold. I walked out, but sometimes I flew back. I hope that was all\r\nright.

"\r\n\r\nIn the cabin Bal spread his great wings. Renaissance painters had never\r\nseen his like but knew exactly how he looked. In their paintings they\r\nhad pictured him innumerable times.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think it hurt us that you flew," said Ethaniel. "I did so\r\nmyself occasionally."\r\n\r\n"But you don\'t know what an angel is?"\r\n\r\n"No. I didn\'t have time to find out. Some creature of their folklore I\r\nsuppose. You know, except for our wings they\'re very much like\r\nourselves. Their legends are bound to resemble ours."\r\n\r\n"Sure," said Bal. "Anyway, peace on Earth."\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Science Fiction Stories_\r\n    January 1960.

He kept looking at\r\nthe floor. He was in his early eighties and sometimes seemed like a\r\nyoung man to Sal. 

His ideas maybe. He thought differently about the\r\nChildren and where things were going.\r\n\r\n"We\'re going to get out tonight," Captain Murphy said again. "We\'ll get\r\nthat barge loaded and we\'ll get out."\r\n\r\nSal sat up. The pills had made his heart settle down a bit, and his\r\nhands were comparatively calm.\r\n\r\n"Is the barge almost loaded now? It better be," Sal said. 

"They\'ll\r\nattack any minute now. I know that much."\r\n\r\n"Another hour\'s all we need. If they attack before then we can hold\r\nthem off long enough to get that barge into the river. Once we get into\r\nthe river with it, we\'ll be safe. We can float her down and into the\r\nsea. Somewhere along the coast we\'ll land and wherever it is will be\r\nfine for us. We\'ll have licked the Children. They know we\'ve found the\r\nonly eatable food stores in God knows how many thousands of miles in\r\nthis goddamned wasteland. They can\'t live another month without this\r\nstuff, and we\'re taking it all down the river. That\'s right isn\'t it,\r\nDoc?

"\r\n\r\nCartley looked up. "But as I said before, squeezing a little more life\r\nout of ourselves doesn\'t mean anything to me. What do we want to get\r\naway and live a little longer for? It doesn\'t make sense, except in a\r\nridiculous selfish way. So we live another month, maybe six months, or\r\na year longer? What for?"\r\n\r\nSal glanced at Murphy who finally sat down.\r\n\r\n"We want to live," Murphy said thickly, and he gripped his hands\r\ntogether. "Survival. It\'s a natural law."\r\n\r\n"What about the survival of the species?" Cartley asked. "By running\r\nout and taking the food, we\'re killing ourselves anyway. So I don\'t\r\nthink I\'ll be with you, Murphy."\r\n\r\n"What are you going to do? 

Stay here? They\'ll torture you to death.\r\nThey\'ll do to you what they did to Donaldson, and all the others\r\nthey\'ve caught. You want to stay for that kind of treatment?

"\r\n\r\n"We ought to try. Running off, taking all this food, that means they\'re\r\nsure to die inside a few weeks. They might catch a few rats or birds,\r\nbut there aren\'t even enough of those around to sustain life beyond\r\na few days. So we kill the future just so we can go on living for a\r\nlittle longer. We\'ve got no reason to live when we know the race will\r\ndie. My wife refused to fight them. They killed her, that\'s true,\r\nbut I still think she was right. We\'ve got to make one more attempt\r\nto establish some kind of truce with the Children. If we had that,\r\nthen we might be able to start building up some kind of relationship.\r\nThe only way they can survive, even if they had food, is to absorb\r\nour knowledge. You know that. Without our knowledge and experience,\r\nthey\'ll die anyway, even if they had a thousand years of food supplies."\r\n\r\n"It can\'t be done," Murphy said.\r\n\r\nCartley looked at the shadows for a long time. Finally he shook his\r\nhead. "I don\'t have any idea how to do it. 

But we should try. We can\'t\r\nuse discipline and power because we\'re too weak. And too outnumbered.\r\nWe\'d have to do that first in order to teach them, and we can\'t. So\r\nthere has to be some other way."\r\n\r\n"Faith?" Sal said. He shook his head. "They don\'t believe in anything.\r\nYou can\'t make any appeal to them through faith, or ethics, any kind of\r\ncode of honor, nothing like that. They\'re worse than animals."\r\n\r\nCartley stood up wearily and started to walk away. "They hate us," he\r\nsaid. "That\'s the one thing we\'re sure of. We\'re the means and they\'re\r\nthe ends. We made them what they are. They\'re brutalized and motivated\r\nalmost completely by hatred. And what\'s underneath hatred?" He fumed\r\nback toward Murphy. "Fear."\r\n\r\nSal stood up. "I never thought of them as being afraid," he said.\r\n\r\n"That doesn\'t matter," Murphy said. "It\'s the hate and vicious\r\nbrutality we have to deal with. 

You do whatever you want to do,\r\nCartley. We\'ve voted, and we\'ve voted to move the stuff out tonight on\r\nthe barge. The world we helped make is dead, Cartley. The Children grew\r\nup in a world we killed. We\'ve all got bad consciences, but we can\'t do\r\nanything about it. The chasm between them and us is too wide. It was\r\nwide even before the bombs fell. And the bombs made it a hell of a lot\r\nwider. Too wide to put any kind of bridge across now."\r\n\r\n"Just the same, we ought to die trying," Cartley said. When he went\r\noutside, Sal followed him.\r\n\r\nThe barge was about loaded. All outer defense units had been pulled in\r\nand were concentrated on the head of the pier behind walls of sandbags.\r\nBurp guns and machine guns were ready, and the barge lay along the side\r\nof the pier in the moonlight like a dead whale. There were several\r\nsewer openings near the head of the pier. Men were stationed around\r\nthese sewers with automatic rifles, hand grenades and flame throwers.\r\n\r\nSal walked to where Cartley stood leaning against the partly closed\r\ndoor of the rotting warehouse. Jagged splinters of steel and wood\r\nangled out against the sky.\r\n\r\nAfter a while, Sal said softly, "Well, what could we try to do, Doc?"\r\n\r\nCartley turned quickly. Some of the anguish in his eyes had gone away,\r\nand he gripped Sal\'s shoulders in hands surprisingly strong for so old\r\na man. "You want to help me try?

"\r\n\r\n"Guess I do. Like you said, we only have a little time left anyway. And\r\nif we can\'t help the Children, what\'s the good of it?"\r\n\r\nThey stood there in the shadows a while, not saying anything.\r\n\r\n"This way," Cartley said. He led Sal down away from the pier and along\r\nthe water\'s edge. Dry reed rustled, and mud squished under their shoes.\r\n\r\n"Here," Cartley said. There was a small flat-bottomed rowboat, and in\r\nit were several cartons of food supplies, all in cans. There were also\r\nseveral large tins of water.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll need a little time," Cartley said. "We\'ll have to wait. I figure\r\nwe\'ll row upstream maybe a few hundred yards, and hole up in one of\r\nthose caves. We can watch, Sal. We can watch and wait and try to figure\r\nit out."\r\n\r\n"Sure," Sal said. 

"That seems the only way to start."\r\n\r\nCartley sat down on the bank near the boat, and Sal sat down too.\r\n\r\n"The Children," Cartley said, "never had a chance to be any other way.\r\nBut we\'re the oldsters, and we\'ve got this obligation, Sal. Man\'s a\r\ncultural animal. He isn\'t born with any inherent concepts of right,\r\nor wrong, or good or bad, or even an ability to survive on an animal\r\nlevel. We have to be taught to survive by the elders, Sal. And we\'re\r\nthe elders." He hesitated, "We\'re the only ones left."\r\n\r\nA flare of horrid light exploded over the warehouse down river and it\r\nlit up Cartley\'s face and turned it a shimmering crimson. His hands\r\nwidened to perfect roundness and he raised his hands in a voiceless\r\nscream to stop the sudden explosions of burp guns, grenades, machine\r\nguns, and rifles.\r\n\r\nLooking down river then, Sal could see the flames eating up through the\r\nwarehouse. The pier, the barge, everything for a hundred square yards\r\nwas lit up as bright as day, and the flare spread out over the river\r\nand made a black ominous shadow of the opposite bank.\r\n\r\n"They\'re getting away," Cartley said.\r\n\r\nSal watched the barge move out. The Children came screaming out of the\r\nblazing warehouse, overran the pier, streamed into the water. But a\r\nsteady blast of fire from the barge drove them back, and in a few more\r\nminutes the barge dissolved downriver into darkness.\r\n\r\nCartley\'s hands were shaking as he gripped Sal\'s arm. "Let\'s go now. 

We\r\nneed time. Time may help us a lot, Sal. We can wait and watch. 

We can\r\nfigure something out."\r\n\r\nSal heard the screams and mocking savage cries coming up over the\r\nwater, and then the jagged cries of some oldsters who hadn\'t managed to\r\nget away.\r\n\r\nStill looking downstream toward the blazing pier, Sal pushed Cartley\r\ninto the rowboat, and they shoved off. Sal started rowing, but he kept\r\nlooking back.\r\n\r\n"They should have put them in the same shelters with us," Sal said,\r\n"that would have made a difference. But they put us in separate\r\nshelters."\r\n\r\nOnly the oldest and the youngest had been saved. The old out of\r\npity and because they were helpless, had been granted the safety of\r\nshelters. The young because they were the symbols of hope had been\r\ngranted shelters, too.\r\n\r\n"No," Cartley said. "It started long before that. The chasm was\r\nbuilding up long before the war. This alienation between the young and\r\nthe old. Between the sun and the seed. That\'s what we\'ve got to bring\r\nback, Sal. Between us, we have stored up a hundred and seventy-nine\r\nyears of human culture. There isn\'t a kid back there, Sal, more than\r\ntwelve years old."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll find a way," Sal said.\r\n\r\nThe rowboat was about fifteen feet away from the thick reeds growing in\r\nthe marshy ooze of the bank.\r\n\r\nCartley heard the sound first and turned, his face white. When Sal\r\nlooked toward the bank, he saw the girl. She came on out from the\r\ncurtain of reeds and looked at them. 

She was perfectly clear in the\r\nmoonlight standing there. She wore a short ragged print dress and she\r\nhad long hair that seemed silken and soft and golden in the moonlight\r\neven though it, her dress, her little legs and her face were streaked\r\nwith mud.\r\n\r\nSal hesitated, then pulled heavily on his left oar and the boat nosed\r\ntoward her. Up close, Sal could see her face, the clear blue eyes wet,\r\nand the tears running down her cheeks.\r\n\r\nThe girl reached out and asked in a sobbing breath,\r\n\r\n"Granpa? Is that you, Granpa?"\r\n\r\n"Oh God, Oh God," Cartley said. He was crying as he picked her up and\r\ngot her into the boat. He was rocking her in his arms and half crying\r\nand half laughing as Sal rowed the boat upstream.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, honey," Sal heard Cartley say over and over. "I\'m your\r\ngranpa, honey. 

Don\'t cry. Go to sleep now. I\'m your granpa and I\'ve\r\nbeen looking for you, honey, and now everything\'s going to be all\r\nright."\r\n\r\nIt\'s funny, Sal thought, as he kept on rowing upstream. It\'s a funny\r\nthing how one little girl remembered her granpa, and how maybe that was\r\nthe beginning of the bridge across the chasm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


"\r\n\r\nMelinda did not quite recoil. He was perhaps five feet tall, with a\r\ngleaming hairless scalp and a young-old face. He wore a plain gray\r\ntunic, and a peddler\'s tray hung from his thin shoulders.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t want any," Melinda stated flatly.\r\n\r\n"_Please._" He had great, beseeching amber eyes. "They all say that. 

I\r\nhaven\'t much time. I must be back at the University by noon."\r\n\r\n"You working your way through college?"\r\n\r\nHe brightened. "Yes. 

I suppose you could call it that. Alien\r\nanthropology major."\r\n\r\nMelinda softened. The initiations those frats pulled nowadays--shaving\r\nthe poor guy\'s head, eating goldfish--it was criminal.\r\n\r\n"Well?" she asked grudgingly. 

"What\'s in the tray?"\r\n\r\n"Flanglers," said the little man eagerly. "Oscilloscopes. Portable\r\nforce-field generators. A neural distorter." Melinda\'s face was blank.\r\nThe little man frowned. "You use them, of course? This _is_ a Class IV\r\nculture?" Melinda essayed a weak shrug and the little man sighed with\r\nrelief. His eyes fled past her to the blank screen of the TV set. "Ah, a\r\nmonitor." He smiled. "For a moment I was afraid--May I come in?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMelinda shrugged, opened the door. This might be interesting, like a\r\nvacuum-cleaner salesman who had cleaned her drapes last week for free.\r\nAnd Kitty Kyle Battles Life wouldn\'t be on for almost an hour.\r\n\r\n"My name is Porteous," said the little man with an eager smile. "I\'m\r\ndoing a thematic on Class IV cultures." 

He whipped out a stylus, began\r\njotting down notes. The TV set fascinated him.\r\n\r\n"It\'s turned off right now," Melinda said.\r\n\r\nPorteous\'s eyes widened impossibly. "You mean," he whispered in horror,\r\n"that you\'re exercising Class V privileges? This is terribly confusing.\r\nI get doors slammed in my face, when Class Fours are supposed to have a\r\nsplendid gregarian quotient--you _do_ have atomic power, don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, sure," said Melinda uncomfortably. 

This wasn\'t going to be much\r\nfun.\r\n\r\n"Space travel?" The little face was intent, sharp.\r\n\r\n"Well," Melinda yawned, looking at the blank screen, "they\'ve got Space\r\nPatrol, Space Cadet, Tales of Tomorrow ..."\r\n\r\n"Excellent. Rocket ships or force-fields?" Melinda blinked. "Does your\r\nhusband own one?" Melinda shook her blonde head helplessly. "What are\r\nyour economic circumstances?"\r\n\r\nMelinda took a deep rasping breath, said, "Listen, mister, is this a\r\ndemonstration or a quiz program?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, my excuse. Demonstration, certainly. 

You will not mind the\r\nquestions?"\r\n\r\n"Questions?" There was an ominous glint in Melinda\'s blue eyes.\r\n\r\n"Your delightful primitive customs, art-forms, personal habits--"\r\n\r\n"Look," Melinda said, crimsoning. "This is a respectable neighborhood,\r\nand I\'m not answering any Kinsey report, understand?"\r\n\r\nThe little man nodded, scribbling. "Personal habits are tabu? I so\r\nregret. 

The demonstration." He waved grandly at the tray. "Anti-grav\r\nsandals? A portable solar converter? Apologizing for this miserable\r\nselection, but on Capella they told me--" He followed Melinda\'s\r\nentranced gaze, selected a tiny green vial. "This is merely a\r\nregenerative solution. You appear to have no cuts or bruises."\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Melinda nastily. "Cures warts, cancer, grows hair, I\r\nsuppose."\r\n\r\nPorteous brightened. 

"Of course. I see you can scan. Amazing." He\r\nscribbled further with his stylus, glanced up, blinked at the obvious\r\nscorn on Melinda\'s face. "Here. 

Try it."\r\n\r\n"You try it." Now watch him squirm!\r\n\r\nPorteous hesitated. "Would you like me to grow an extra finger, hair--"\r\n\r\n"Grow some hair." Melinda tried not to smile.\r\n\r\nThe little man unstopped the vial, poured a shimmering green drop on his\r\nwrist, frowning.\r\n\r\n"Must concentrate," he said. "Thorium base, suspended solution. Really\r\njolts the endocrines, complete control ... see?

"\r\n\r\nMelinda\'s jaw dropped. She stared at the tiny tuft of hair which had\r\nsprouted on that bare wrist. She was thinking abruptly, unhappily, about\r\nthat chignon she had bought yesterday. They had let her buy that for\r\neight dollars when with this stuff she could have a natural one.\r\n\r\n"How much?" she inquired cautiously.\r\n\r\n"A half hour of your time only," said Porteous.\r\n\r\nMelinda grasped the vial firmly, settled down on the sofa with one leg\r\ntucked carefully under her.\r\n\r\n"Okay, shoot. But nothing personal.

"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPorteous was delighted. He asked a multitude of questions, most of them\r\npointless, some naive, and Melinda dug into her infinitesimal fund of\r\nknowledge and gave. The little man scribbled furiously, clucking like a\r\ngravid hen.\r\n\r\n"You mean," he asked in amazement, "that you live in these primitive\r\nhuts of your own volition?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s a G.I. housing project," Melinda said, ashamed.\r\n\r\n"Astonishing." He wrote: _Feudal anachronisms and atomic power, side by\r\nside. Class Fours periodically "rough it" in back-to-nature movements._\r\n\r\nHarry Junior chose that moment to begin screaming for his lunch.\r\nPorteous sat, trembling. "Is that a Security Alarm?"\r\n\r\n"My son," said Melinda despondently, and went into the nursery.\r\n\r\nPorteous followed, and watched the ululating child with some\r\ntrepidation. "Newborn?"\r\n\r\n"Eighteen months," said Melinda stiffly, changing diapers. "He\'s cutting\r\nteeth."\r\n\r\nPorteous shuddered. "What a pity. Obviously atavistic. Wouldn\'t the\r\ncreche accept him? You shouldn\'t have to keep him here."\r\n\r\n"I keep after Harry to get a maid, but he says we can\'t afford one."\r\n\r\n"Manifestly insecure," muttered the little man, studying Harry Junior.\r\n"Definite paranoid tendencies."\r\n\r\n"He was two weeks premature," volunteered Melinda. "He\'s real\r\nsensitive."\r\n\r\n"I know just the thing," Porteous said happily. "Here." He dipped into\r\nthe glittering litter on the tray and handed Harry Junior a translucent\r\nprism. "A neural distorter. We use it to train regressives on Rigel Two.\r\nIt might be of assistance."\r\n\r\nMelinda eyed the thing doubtfully. Harry Junior was peering into the\r\nshifting crystal depths with a somewhat strained expression.\r\n\r\n"Speeds up the neural flow," explained the little man proudly. "Helps\r\ntap the unused eighty per cent. The pre-symptomatic memory is\r\nunaffected, due to automatic cerebral lapse in case of overload. I\'m\r\nafraid it won\'t do much more than cube his present IQ, and an\r\nintelligent idiot is still an idiot, but--"\r\n\r\n"How dare you?" Melinda\'s eyes flashed. "My son is _not_ an idiot! You\r\nget out of here this minute and take your--things with you." As she\r\nreached for the prism, Harry Junior squalled. Melinda relented. "Here,"\r\nshe said angrily, fumbling with her purse. "How much are they?"\r\n\r\n"Medium of exchange?" Porteous rubbed his bald skull. "Oh, I really\r\nshouldn\'t--but it\'ll make such a wonderful addendum to the chapter on\r\nmalignant primitives. What is your smallest denomination?"\r\n\r\n"Is a dollar okay?" Melinda was hopeful.\r\n\r\nPorteous was pleased with the picture of George Washington. He turned\r\nthe bill over and over in his fingers, at last bowed low and formally,\r\napologized for any tabu violations, and left via the front door.\r\n\r\n"Crazy fraternities," muttered Melinda, turning on the TV set.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKitty Kyle was dull that morning. At length Melinda used some of the\r\nliquid in the green vial on her eyelashes, was quite pleased at the\r\nresults, and hid the rest in the medicine cabinet.\r\n\r\nHarry Junior was a model of docility the rest of that day. While Melinda\r\nwatched TV and munched chocolates, did and re-did her hair, Harry Junior\r\nplayed quietly with the crystal prism.\r\n\r\nToward late afternoon, he crawled over to the bookcase, wrestled down\r\nthe encyclopedia and pawed through it, gurgling with delight. He\r\ndefinitely, Melinda decided, would make a fine lawyer someday, not a\r\nuseless putterer like Big Harry, who worked all hours overtime in that\r\ndamned lab. She scowled as Harry Junior, bored with the encyclopedia,\r\nbegan reaching for one of Big Harry\'s tomes on nuclear physics. One\r\nputterer in the family was enough! But when she tried to take the book\r\naway from him, Harry Junior howled so violently that she let well enough\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nAt six-thirty, Big Harry called from the lab, with the usual despondent\r\nmessage that he would not be home for supper. Melinda said a few\r\nresigned things about cheerless dinners eaten alone, hinted darkly what\r\nlonesome wives sometimes did for company, and Harry said he was very\r\nsorry, but this might be _it_, and Melinda hung up on him in a temper.\r\n\r\nPrecisely fifteen minutes later, the doorbell rang. Melinda opened the\r\nfront door and gaped. This little man could have been Porteous\'s double,\r\nexcept for the black metallic tunic, the glacial gray eyes.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Melinda Adams?" 

Even the voice was frigid.\r\n\r\n"Y-Yes. Why--"\r\n\r\n"Major Nord, Galactic Security." The little man bowed. "You were visited\r\nearly this morning by one Porteous." He spoke the name with a certain\r\ndisgust. "He left a neural distorter here. Correct?"\r\n\r\nMelinda\'s nod was tremulous. Major Nord came quietly into the living\r\nroom, shut the door behind him. "My apologies, madam, for the intrusion.\r\nPorteous mistook your world for a Class IV culture, instead of a Class\r\nVII. Here--" He handed her the crumpled dollar bill. "You may check the\r\nserial number. The distorter, please."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMelinda shrunk limply onto the sofa. "I don\'t understand," she said\r\npainfully. "Was he a thief?"\r\n\r\n"He was--careless about his spatial coordinates." Major Nord\'s teeth\r\nshowed in the faintest of smiles. "He has been corrected. Where is it?"\r\n\r\n"Now look," said Melinda with some asperity. "That thing\'s kept Harry\r\nJunior quiet all day. I bought it in good faith, and it\'s not my\r\nfault--say, have you got a warrant?"\r\n\r\n"Madam," said the Major with dignity, "I dislike violating local tabus,\r\nbut must I explain the impact of a neural distorter on a backwater\r\nculture? What if your Neanderthal had been given atomic blasters? Where\r\nwould you have been today? Swinging through trees, no doubt. What if\r\nyour Hitler had force-fields?" He exhaled. 

"Where is your son?"\r\n\r\nIn the nursery, Harry Junior was contentedly playing with his blocks.\r\nThe prism lay glinting in the corner.\r\n\r\nMajor Nord picked it up carefully, scrutinized Harry Junior. His voice\r\nwas very soft.\r\n\r\n"You said he was--playing with it?"\r\n\r\nSome vestigial maternal instinct prompted Melinda to shake her head\r\nvigorously. The little man stared hard at Harry Junior, who began\r\nwhimpering. Trembling, Melinda scooped up Harry Junior.\r\n\r\n"Is _that_ all you have to do--run around frightening women and\r\nchildren? Take your old distorter and get out. 

Leave decent people\r\nalone!"\r\n\r\nMajor Nord frowned. If only he could be sure. He peered stonily at Harry\r\nJunior, murmured, "Definite egomania. It doesn\'t seem to have affected\r\nhim. 

Strange."\r\n\r\n"Do you want me to scream?" Melinda demanded.\r\n\r\nMajor Nord sighed. He bowed to Melinda, went out, closed the door,\r\ntouched a tiny stud on his tunic, and vanished.\r\n\r\n"The manners of some people," Melinda said to Harry Junior. She was\r\nrelieved that the Major had not asked for the green vial.\r\n\r\nHarry Junior also looked relieved, although for quite a different\r\nreason.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBig Harry arrived home a little after eleven. There were small worry\r\ncreases about his mouth and forehead, and the leaden cast of defeat in\r\nhis eyes. He went into the bedroom and Melinda sleepily told him about\r\nthe little man working his way through college by peddling silly goods,\r\nand about that rude cop named Nord, and Harry said that was simply\r\nastonishing and Melinda said, "Harry, you had a drink!"\r\n\r\n"I had two drinks," Harry told her owlishly. "You married a failure,\r\ndear. Part of the experimental model vaporized, _wooosh_, just like\r\nthat. On paper it looked so good--"\r\n\r\nMelinda had heard it all before. She asked him to see if Harry Junior\r\nwas covered, and Big Harry went unsteadily into the nursery, sat down by\r\nhis son\'s crib.\r\n\r\n"Poor little guy," he mused. "Your old man\'s a bum, a useless tinker. He\r\nthought he could send Man to the stars on a string of helium nuclei. Oh,\r\nhe was smart. Thought of everything. Auxiliary jets to kick off the\r\nnegative charge, bigger mercury vapor banks--a fine straight thrust of\r\npositive Alpha particles." He hiccuped, put his face in his hands.\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t you ever stop to think that a few air molecules could defocus\r\nthe stream? Try a vacuum, stupid."\r\n\r\nBig Harry stood up.\r\n\r\n"Did you say something, son?"\r\n\r\n"Gurfle," said Harry Junior.\r\n\r\nBig Harry reeled into the living room like a somnambulist.\r\n\r\nHe got pencil and paper, began jotting frantic formulae. Presently he\r\ncalled a cab and raced back to the laboratory.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMelinda was dreaming about little bald men with diamond-studded trays.\r\nThey were chasing her, they kept pelting her with rubies and emeralds,\r\nall they wanted was to ask questions, but she kept running, Harry Junior\r\nclasped tightly in her arms. Now they were ringing alarm bells. The\r\nbells kept ringing and she groaned, sat up in bed, and seized the\r\ntelephone.\r\n\r\n"Darling." Big Harry\'s voice shook. "I\'ve got it! More auxiliary\r\nshielding plus a vacuum. We\'ll be rich!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s just fine," said Melinda crossly. "You woke the baby."\r\n\r\nHarry Junior was sobbing bitterly into his pillow.

]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the two Geno-Doctors were gone, Miryam took the red capsule from\r\nunder the base of the bedlamp and slipped it between her dry lips.\r\n\r\nReason told her to swallow the capsule quickly, but instead she held it\r\nunder her tongue, clinging, against her will, to the last few moments\r\nof life.\r\n\r\nShe knew she was being weak, that she was still seeking hope where\r\nthere was no hope, and she prayed to the ancient God of the Ghetto that\r\nthe gelatin coating would dissolve quickly.\r\n\r\nPain interrupted the prayer, spreading like slow fire from deep within\r\nher young body, where the unwanted child of Genetics Center stirred so\r\nrestlessly, so impatient to be born.\r\n\r\nThe white walls of her Center room blurred in and out of focus. Shadows\r\nmerged together in brief, uncertain patterns. Lights flickered where\r\nthere were no lights, and the darkness was so intense it had a glare of\r\nits own.\r\n\r\nAt the worst of the pain cycle, Miryam bit down on her under lip until\r\nthe flesh showed as white as her teeth. She fought off temptation to\r\ncrunch the capsule and put an end to all pain, all fear.\r\n\r\nNo, she would not go that way. She would go in a moment of blinding\r\nclarity, knowing why, savoring the last bitter sweet second of her\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\nWith a subconscious gesture of femininity, Miryam brushed the dark,\r\ndamp hair from her forehead, and wiped the perspiration from her lips.\r\n\r\n"Pretty little thing," one of the Geno-Service agents had called her,\r\nwhen she was arrested last fall in the Warsaw suburb where she had\r\ntaught nursery school since escaping from the Ghetto.\r\n\r\n"Doesn\'t look a bit like one of her kind," another agent had said,\r\nputting his hand under her chin and turning her face to the glare of\r\nhis flashlight. "No wonder she fooled the Psycho and Chemico squads....\r\nLucky for us!

"\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter, little one?" 

the first agent had spoken again.\r\n"Didn\'t you know we were coming? I thought all of you people were\r\nsupposed to be telepaths.... Or doesn\'t it work when you\'re asleep?"\r\n\r\nHe flipped the covers off her trembling body and whistled.\r\n\r\n"Hands off!" the Geno-Sergeant had warned sharply. "She\'s for Center!"\r\n\r\nNow the capsule under her tongue was moist and soft. 

Time fled on\r\nswift, fluttering wings. Soon the horror would be done.\r\n\r\nBut the stubborn spark still glowed, and Miryam allowed her mind to\r\ndrift down the long, shining corridor to the room where the younger of\r\nthe two Geno-Doctors was changing into a white coat. The older man, who\r\nwore the gold trefoil of Geno-Sar on his collar, tilted back in his\r\nchair.\r\n\r\n"She should be just about due," he said cheerfully.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Sir," replied the young doctor, sounding the proper note of\r\ndeference for a man who communed daily with the political elite.\r\n\r\n"What do you think of her?"\r\n\r\n"Well, Sir, frankly--I was surprised--" The young doctor twisted\r\nmuscular arms to button the back of his jacket. He had but recently\r\ncome from the Genetics Sanitarium on the Black Sea, and his face was\r\ntanned deep brown. "From reading the weekly reports of your staff, I\r\ndidn\'t know she was that--that young--"\r\n\r\nMiryam trembled with a hope she dared not recognize, but it was crushed\r\nout of her by the Geno-Sar\'s booming voice.\r\n\r\n"Not only one of the youngest--but one of the very best specimens we\'ve\r\nhad to work with at Center! You read her psi rating?

"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Sir. Seventy-two point four, wasn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Seventy-two point six! Absolutely phenomenal! Closest thing to a pure\r\ntelepath our agents have ever turned up for us! This could be a big\r\nnight for Center, my boy.... A big night!

"\r\n\r\nThe young doctor shook his head to clear away the lingering image of a\r\ntragic, lovely face against a tear-stained pillow. Miryam was startled\r\nto find this image in his mind, and her pulse leaped again.\r\n\r\nIn a carefully professional tone, the young doctor asked:\r\n\r\n"What was her rating after insemination? Did the emotional shock...?

"\r\n\r\n"Not at all! Oh, naturally, she was uncooperative in the tests, but\r\npentathol and our cross-references gave us a true picture!"\r\n\r\n"And the spermatozoa?

"\r\n\r\n"Best we could get! Refrigerated about thirty years ago from a specimen\r\nthat tested forty-seven point eight."\r\n\r\nThe Geno-Sar paused, and because a comment was obviously in order, the\r\nyoung doctor said:\r\n\r\n"This certainly could be a big night for Center!"\r\n\r\nThe Geno-Sar snapped his cigarette lighter with an expansive flourish.\r\n\r\n"All the sciences have been taking a crack at psi--ever since the last\r\nPolitbureau directive gave it number one priority. You should have\r\nheard the talk at Sar-Bureau meeting this afternoon! The Math-Sar\r\nactually laughed at Genetics ... told us to stick to our white mice!"\r\n\r\nThe young doctor made a polite cluck of disapproval.\r\n\r\n"Those stupid mathematicians could learn something of heredity from\r\ntheir own ancients," the Geno-Sar continued, growing heated. "Think of\r\nLiebnitz, gifted at 14--Galois, a genius before he was 21!"\r\n\r\nThe Geno-Sar recovered his temper, and winked.\r\n\r\n"Of course, I didn\'t say that at the meeting--the Bureau chief is very\r\npartial to Math--but I did remind them, most pointedly, of the known\r\ndata on inherited sensory differences between individuals. And you\r\nshould have seen the squirming! Especially when I got into the taste\r\nstudies and the phenyl-thio-carbamide tests! Then, when I told of\r\nGenetics research on sense of time--sense of direction--sensitivity to\r\npain, sound and smells--Well, the Chief was hanging on my every word!\r\nThe Psycho-Sar became desperate to the point of rashness, and he jibed\r\nat me about our ancient master, Profim Lysenko." The Geno-Sar\'s head\r\ninclined slightly as he pronounced the name. "But the Chief himself\r\ngave the correct answer! He quoted from a Bureau directive which stated\r\nclearly that sensory characteristics, like any others, could well have\r\nbeen acquired in the first place, and then passed on through heredity!\r\nOh, I tell you, it was a heart-warming afternoon!"\r\n\r\nThe younger man had been paying him only half attention.\r\n\r\n"It\'s strange we should find some cases of psi among her people," he\r\nmused. "When I was at the University I always meant to study something\r\nabout the--" he hesitated and searched for the approved term, "--the\r\nspecimen races, but I never had time...."\r\n\r\nFor an instant the Geno-Sar\'s steel-blue eyes narrowed, and Miryam was\r\nshocked to find him appraising the young man for possible heresy. She\r\nhad always regarded the scientific mind as something remote, cold, but\r\nnever as something that could commit a heresy.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Geno-Sar decided to table the subject.\r\n\r\n"Of course you didn\'t!" he boomed. "You couldn\'t have made such a\r\nsplendid record without total specialization! Each to his own, that\'s\r\nhow science has prospered under the benevolence of our party!" He\r\nglanced up at the clock. "Well, aren\'t we just about ready for this\r\ndelivery?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMiryam drew back her mind. What a fool she was to go on seeking!\r\n\r\nThe child resumed its inexorable turning within her swollen body,\r\nand she knew she could never give to the world a life conceived so\r\nterribly, so coldly, without love or passion or tenderness.\r\n\r\nEven in these final moments, with the gelatin melting under her tongue,\r\nMiryam shuddered with the remembered anguish of struggling up from the\r\ndepths of anaesthesia to find herself bearing the seed of a child, from\r\na faceless man who had died long ago.\r\n\r\nOften, during the carefully guarded months of pregnancy, she had\r\nwondered about that man, who he had been, how his talent had compared\r\nwith hers.\r\n\r\nMiryam knew little about genetics, or any other science. The scientific\r\nmind had always frightened her, and she had feared to explore it.\r\nBut she knew there was no truth to the folklore that psi was a\r\ncharacteristic of her people. She knew of only a few cases outside\r\nher own family, although within her family it seemed to have been a\r\ncharacteristic that had recurred frequently for many generations. Her\r\nfather had cautioned her about selecting a husband, and pleaded with\r\nher not to flee the Ghetto.\r\n\r\nFor the past three days, since the nurse had momentarily left the\r\ncabinet at the end of the corridor unlocked and unguarded, Miryam had\r\nknown that she need not be concerned about the success or failure of\r\nthis terrible experiment. From the nurse\'s mind she had plucked the\r\nessential facts about the potency of the red capsule. This knowledge,\r\nfor all its loneliness, had been something to cherish, to press to her\r\nfull breasts, as she would never hold that child of horror.\r\n\r\nTears filled her eyes, squeezed in droplets between the closed lids.\r\nTears because she was so alone. Tears of unbearable sadness and pity,\r\nfor her people, for her youth and her young body, for the warmth that\r\nwould be eternally cold, for the unnatural child that squirmed and\r\nturned, and would never cry.\r\n\r\nIn a last forlorn gesture, in a final seeking before the darkness\r\nclosed, Miryam let her mind stray out of the white room, out of the\r\nmarble magnificence of Center. She let her thoughts escape on the soft\r\nbreeze of the early summer evening.\r\n\r\nHow beautiful it was, even here in the city, amid the science buildings\r\nthat formed bright islands of light around the minarets and vaulted\r\ndomes of Government Square.\r\n\r\nEven these awesome buildings were lovely in the purple dusk. Their\r\nwindows were like scattered emeralds of light.\r\n\r\nHow could there be so much beauty without compassion? So much knowledge\r\nwithout understanding? So much human genius without humanity?\r\n\r\nAnd what a battering of thoughts in the mild air around the centers of\r\nscience! What a discordance! What a tumult of theories, each of them\r\nnurtured within its own walls by the zealous Sars.\r\n\r\nThere were the Departments of Chemistry and Physics. There was the\r\nglass-walled tower of Astronomy! There was the Institute of Psychology,\r\nwith all its many bureaus. And the new Electronics Building, alabaster\r\neven in the dusk.\r\n\r\nThey were all there, extending in stately splendor along the main\r\navenues, and along the park, where the gossamer mist was rising.\r\n\r\nHow intolerant were the thoughts they radiated! How sure!\r\n\r\nElectronics said: "Quite obviously the answer to psi is in the\r\nelectrical currents of the brain. Our newest electro-encephalograph has\r\ndemonstrated...."\r\n\r\nChemistry said: "Solution to psi inevitably will be found in the\r\nchemical balance of the cells...."\r\n\r\nParapsychology said: "We must continue to ignore those who insist upon\r\nattributing physical properties to a non-physical characteristic...."\r\n\r\nAnd underneath this learned babble, Miryam heard the moth-like\r\nwhispering of her own people, starving in the Ghetto, or hidden\r\nthroughout the city, disguised, furtive, tense.\r\n\r\nHer mind came close to Government Square, and she cringed, as she\r\nhad cringed all her young life. The somatics were unbearable. Hatred\r\nand fear, blind prejudice, jealousy, cunning, ceaseless intrigue and\r\nplotting, setting Sar against Sar, using the genius of each science,\r\ndividing and ruling.\r\n\r\nNo, there was nothing left. No hope, no promise. This was the end of\r\ntime. This was the night of the world.\r\n\r\nWithdrawing again, retreating into itself, Miryam\'s mind brushed the\r\nfragment of a thought. It was a half-formed thought, more a groping,\r\nmore a question, than an idea. 

It was delicate, fragile, a wraith and a\r\nwisp. But it came to her as clear as the note from a silver bell.\r\n\r\nStartled, she hesitated in her withdrawal, and perceived the young\r\nGeno-Doctor in the corridor near her room. He had paused by the\r\ncasement window, and was staring out at the twinkling islands of light\r\naround Government Square.\r\n\r\nAnd as his gaze wandered moodily from Tech, to Psycho, to Chemico, to\r\nall the incandescent, isolated centers of genius, the idle speculation\r\nhad formed.\r\n\r\n"Wouldn\'t it be an unusual view if all those bright islands were\r\nconnected by strings of light...?"\r\n\r\nOnce formed, the speculation had fanned the ember of a thought:\r\n\r\n"Wonder if psi will build those strings of lights?"\r\n\r\nThen the young doctor turned almost guiltily from the window to\r\nmeet the Geno-Sar coming down the corridor. And he said with crisp\r\nefficiency,\r\n\r\n"I\'ll check out 12-A for delivery."\r\n\r\n"Good boy! I\'ll go on up and check the staff...." The Geno-Sar rubbed\r\nhis hands together, and walked off, repeating nervously, "Two psi\r\ncharacteristics must be the answer--two psi--"\r\n\r\n"Maybe they are," the young doctor murmured softly. "Maybe they are...."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDelivery, Miryam thought. The life within her throbbed and prodded.\r\nThere was an ebbing of pain for a moment, and in that moment she saw\r\nwith the blinding clarity she had sought that this child of hers might\r\nbring new hope to the world. That psi ability might be the answer to\r\nmany things for the race of mankind. What did it matter that it was\r\nconceived without love and emotion. What did it matter that she was\r\nbeing used as an experiment ... if this child within her could fulfill\r\nthe promise.\r\n\r\nMiryam spat the soft capsule between her quivering lips. She watched it\r\nroll and bounce across the polished tile floor, toward the door.\r\n\r\nPain returned, and its fire was warm. There were no shadows on the\r\nwall. Pain returned, and it had purpose and promise. Wonderingly, she\r\nbeheld the concept that science, too, lived with fear, each science in\r\nits own Ghetto. And if the young doctor was right, if psi....\r\n\r\nAs the doctor stepped into the room, he bent over and picked up the\r\nred capsule. His thumb and forefinger felt the warmth, the moisture,\r\nand he looked long and thoughtfully into Miryam\'s dark, glowing eyes.\r\n\r\nHis fingers shook as he wrapped the capsule in a piece of tissue and\r\ndropped it into the pocket of his white jacket. He picked up the chart\r\nfrom the foot of the bed.\r\n\r\n"Miryam--" His voice was not under complete control, and he began\r\nagain, with an effort at lightness. "Miryam--that\'s a strange name.\r\nWhat does it mean?"\r\n\r\n"It is an ancient spelling," she whispered, her eyes deep and dark,\r\nfilled with pain and wonder. 

"You may find it easier to call me--Mary."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


Cruthers was a busy man. Coordinating the biggest parade in New\r\nYork\'s history is not easy. He was maneuvering his two hundred pounds\r\naround Washington Square with the agility of a quarterback. He had his\r\nhands full organizing marchers, locating floats, placing the many brass\r\nbands in their proper order and barking commands to assistants. But Mr.\r\nCruthers approached the job with all the zeal of an evangelist at a\r\nrevival meeting.\r\n\r\nAs he approached the south-west corner of the square he saw something\r\nthat jarred his already frayed nerves. He stopped abruptly. The mass of\r\nclipboards and papers he was carrying fell to the street. There before\r\nhim were one hundred and fifty ants, each of them at least six feet\r\ntall. His first impulse was to turn and run for the nearest doctor. He\r\nwas certain that the strain of his job was proving too much for him. But\r\none of the ants approached him. It seemed friendly enough, so Mr.\r\nCruthers stood his ground.\r\n\r\n"My group is waiting for their assignment." The ant\'s voice seemed to be\r\ncoming from the very core of its thorax which was a violent red.\r\n\r\n"Good Lord!" Mr. 

Cruthers\' mouth opened up as wide as an oven door.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Cruthers, I believe the parade is about to start and my group--"\r\n\r\nMr. Cruthers managed to blurt out. "What the devil _are_ you anyway!"\r\n\r\n"This _is_ the parade marking the International Geophysical Year, is it\r\nnot?" The ant had a pleasant, friendly voice.\r\n\r\n"Well, yes, but--"\r\n\r\n"And you are Mr. Cruthers, the manager of the parade, is that not\r\ncorrect?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Cruthers rubbed his eyes and took another look at the strange\r\ncreature. Its head was a brilliant yellow. It had two large goggle eyes\r\nwhich rolled like itinerant marbles when it spoke. The low slung abdomen\r\nwas a burnt brown. It was bad enough, Cruthers thought, that these ants\r\nwere six feet tall, but it was nightmarish to see them in three colors.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Cruthers," the ant continued, "haven\'t you been instructed by the\r\nNational Academy of Sciences that the Martian V.F.W. is to participate\r\nin this parade?"\r\n\r\n"The Martian--!!" 

Mr. Cruthers\' mouth was open again. Then he realized\r\nthat when the ant spoke its mouth didn\'t move. He picked up his\r\nclipboard and papers from the street. His voice was hostile now. "What\r\nthe hell is this, some kind of a gag! What are you trying to do, scare a\r\nman half to death!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, we\'re not joking, Mr. 

Cruthers. The National Academy--"\r\n\r\n"They didn\'t say anything to me about a bunch of clowns dressed up like\r\nants!" Mr. 

Cruthers\' indignation became intensified. He was loathe to\r\nadmit that he\'d been taken in by such obviously animated costumes. "Now\r\nlook here, I\'m a very busy man."\r\n\r\n"The arrangements _have_ been made, Mr. 

Cruthers. If my group is refused\r\na place in this parade we shall file suit immediately. As manager you\'ll\r\nbe named co-defendant." The ant was gentle but firm.\r\n\r\nThe thought of being sued softened Mr. Cruthers\' attitude. "Well, I\'m\r\nvery sorry, pal, but every contingent in this parade is listed on my\r\nclipboard and you\'re not. I know this list by heart. 

What did you say\r\nthe name of your group was?"\r\n\r\n"The Martian V.F.W."\r\n\r\nMr. Cruthers was amused. "Those sure are the craziest outfits I\'ve ever\r\nseen," he chuckled. "Where\'d you get them? Walt Disney make them for\r\nyou?" He followed his own little joke with a long throaty laugh.\r\n\r\nThe ant was impatient. "About the parade, Mr. Cruthers, there isn\'t much\r\ntime."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, the parade. Well, let me see," he thumbed through the\r\nclipboard, "I guess there\'s always room for a few laughs. How many in\r\nyour group?"\r\n\r\n"One hundred and fifty. And we also have a float with us. Not a very\r\nlarge one. 

It measures twenty by twenty."\r\n\r\n"Tell you what. You move your group to the corner of Thompson Street and\r\nThird Street. Get behind the Tiffany float and follow them, okay?"\r\n\r\nThe ant paused a moment to record the instructions in his mind. Then he\r\nturned to leave.\r\n\r\n"Oh, wait a minute," Mr. Cruthers cried before the ant could rejoin his\r\ngroup. "Just who did you speak to at the National Academy of Sciences?"\r\n\r\n"I believe it was a Mr. Canfield."\r\n\r\nMr. Cruthers\' face lit up. "Well, why didn\'t you say so in the first\r\nplace! I\'d have placed you right away."\r\n\r\n"That\'s perfectly all right, Mr. 

Cruthers."\r\n\r\n"Listen, I don\'t know what you guys do but those costumes should\r\ncertainly bring the house down. There\'s going to be four million people\r\nwatching this parade. I bet that\'s the biggest audience you\'ve ever\r\nseen."\r\n\r\n"It certainly is." With that the ant strode away.\r\n\r\n"Good luck!" Mr. Cruthers shouted after him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Daddy! Daddy, look! Look at the big rocket!" The little boy jumped up\r\nand down gleefully. "It must be a whole mile long, Daddy! What kind is\r\nit?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s the Vanguard, son."\r\n\r\nAn autumn breeze from the East River chilled their vantage point at\r\nSixty-First Street and Fifth Avenue.\r\n\r\n"The Vanguard?" The name meant nothing to the boy. "Gee, I\'ll bet it can\r\nfly all the way to the stars!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s the rocket that carried the first artificial satellite into\r\nspace."\r\n\r\nThe parade, now three hours old, continued past the reviewing stand.\r\n\r\n"I wanna get a better look at the Vanguard!" the boy shouted.\r\n\r\nThe father lifted the boy onto his shoulders. The little fellow laughed\r\nand whooped it up, firing several shots from his Captain Video Ray gun\r\nat the passing missile.\r\n\r\nThe rocket moved on and the noise of the crowd diminished slightly.\r\n\r\nA one-hundred piece brass band was passing in front of them. They were\r\nplaying "The Stars and Stripes Forever." They were followed by the Sak\'s\r\nFifth Avenue display; nine small floats, each depicting life on another\r\nplanet. The National Academy of Sciences had a success on its hands.\r\n\r\n"Wow! Daddy, I wanna ride on it! I wanna ride on that float and visit\r\nall those planets! Can I, Daddy!" The boy became all limbs trying to\r\nsquirm down from his father\'s shoulders.\r\n\r\n"You stay right where you are, young man," the father struggled to hold\r\nhis balance.\r\n\r\n"But I wanna go to the stars. I can watch the rest of the parade from\r\nVenus or Mercury! Please, Daddy!

"\r\n\r\nThe father grinned. "Not just yet, son, but it won\'t be long before man\r\nwill go to the stars."\r\n\r\n"Who lives up there, Daddy?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, there isn\'t any life up there yet."\r\n\r\n"If no one\'s living up there why does anyone want to go there?"\r\n\r\n"Well, maybe there\'ll be too many people on earth someday and then we\'ll\r\nhave to find other planets with more room."\r\n\r\nAnother monstrous brass band was going by. The boy became restless. He\r\nbegan to toy with his ray gun, half interested in seeing if there were\r\nany sparks left in it. "Why can\'t there be something besides so many\r\nbands in a parade? I wanna see another float."\r\n\r\nThe father tried to interest the boy by pointing out all the famous\r\npeople who were also there: a variety of statesmen the world\'s leading\r\nscientists and religious and cultural leaders, the president of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe boy was interested but not in what his elder was saying to him. He\r\nwas looking downtown, his eyes squinting, trying to make out figures as\r\nfar away as Fifty-sixth Street. Then his mouth opened, not uttering a\r\nsound yet, just waiting to burst with joy at what was coming toward\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nHis father looked up at him. "I wish you\'d tell me what you are looking\r\nat. 

I\'m all the way down here on street level, remember?"\r\n\r\n"Daddy, they look like ants!"\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"Ants, Daddy, ants! A whole army of them. Ain\'t it exciting?

"\r\n\r\n"What on earth are you talking about?"\r\n\r\n"They\'re doing somersaults and back flips and everything! They\'re coming\r\nright this way! Gee, there\'s hundreds of them. And they got a float\r\nbehind them, Daddy! A great big float with something burning on it."\r\n\r\nThe child sitting on his shoulders made mobility impossible for the\r\nfather. And he couldn\'t see around the spectators. He resigned himself\r\nto stand and wait for this new spectacle to overtake them. The reaction\r\nto this new sight had already begun to work its way uptown. In the\r\ndistance, but getting closer every second, he could hear unrestrained\r\nlaughter and rejoicing.\r\n\r\n"Hey, take it easy!" The boy was beginning to ride the shoulders like a\r\nbronco buster. "By the time they get here I won\'t have any shoulders\r\nleft. Where are they now?"\r\n\r\n"They\'re almost here, Daddy! And they aren\'t ants at all. They\'re just a\r\nbunch of clowns dressed up like it." He began to giggle hysterically.\r\n"Golly, they\'re funny. Can you see them yet, Daddy?"\r\n\r\nBefore the father could produce an answer the ants were in view. They\r\nwere a sight that couldn\'t fail to stimulate the funny bone. By\r\ncomparison with real ants everything about them had been grossly\r\nexaggerated to achieve the proper effect. They walked on their two back\r\nlegs but the four front apertures were far from idle. 

Some of them\r\nturned somersaults, others did complicated flips consisting of two or\r\nthree spins in mid-air. Still others, doing a kind of animated cakewalk,\r\ncarried toy ray guns which they fired at random into the crowd. The\r\nguns were something like the little boy\'s Captain Video ray gun, only\r\nlarger. They emitted little streaks of blue sparks which shone brightly\r\nbut disappeared when contact was made with air.\r\n\r\nThey were easily the hit of the parade, a three ring circus all by\r\nthemselves, as they pranced and clowned their way up Fifth Avenue giving\r\nthe spectators a whale of a show that was completely new.\r\n\r\nThe guests on the reviewing stand refrained from any hilarity until they\r\nsaw the float that four of the ants were pulling behind them. It was in\r\nkeeping with the rest of the nonsense they were perpetrating. The float\r\nboasted eight larger ray guns, three on either side and two in the rear,\r\nthat fired the same fascinating blue sparks. Behind each gun an ant\r\nstood on its head, wildly waving six legs in the breeze, begging to be\r\nnoticed and laughed at. Above the guns, emblazoned in fiery orange\r\nletters, were the words: "MARTIAN V.F.W." This was interpreted by one\r\nand all as a punch line and was treated accordingly.\r\n\r\nIt was heartwarming to be able to see the president and so many other\r\ndignitaries abandon composure in favor of a good old fashioned belly\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n"Daddy, I can\'t laugh any more," the boy had to pause between every\r\nother word. "My stomach hurts. Aren\'t they the funniest things you ever\r\nsaw?"\r\n\r\nThe father was too convulsed to be able to answer him.\r\n\r\n"Daddy, one of them is coming this way! He\'s firing his Captain Video\r\nray gun at us!" They boy squeezed his father and held on tight.\r\n\r\nThe father took a deep breath in order to be able to speak. "Take your\r\ngun and fire back at him, son. Fire away! Go on, he\'s just being\r\nplayful!" He broke forth with another gust of laughter. "I won\'t see\r\nanything as funny as this again if I live to be a hundred!"\r\n\r\nThe ant pranced over to where they were standing, firing its gun in\r\nevery direction. The boy fired back. The ant took one look at the lad\'s\r\ngun and let out a long cackling sound which built to a crescendo and\r\nthen stopped as though it had been turned off. The ant rejoined the\r\ngroup and they continued on their merry way.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe boy fired several shots into the float as it passed. He wanted to\r\nsee if he could knock out those blazing orange letters: MARTIAN V.F.W.\r\nThe letters continued to burn, but in the boy\'s mind he was certain he\r\nhad made several direct hits.\r\n\r\nThe boy and his father watched the float until it was out of sight. They\r\nknew there wouldn\'t be another attraction like those ants. They must\r\nhave been real professionals, the father thought. Such teamwork! Such\r\nprecision! 

Each one of them having a specific job to do and each doing\r\nit to perfection. After them everything was bound to be anticlimactic.\r\n\r\nMore marchers, more bands, a few more floats. The boy was beginning to\r\ntire. It had been a long day. Now everything was dull. "Daddy, I don\'t\r\nwant to see any more. Let\'s go home."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll stay another five minutes."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe parade somehow seemed to be slowing down. The father yawned and let\r\nhis son down from his shoulders. He looked across the street at the\r\npresident and the other dignitaries on the reviewing stand. All were\r\nslowly raising their hands in salute as another color guard drowsily\r\nmade its way by.\r\n\r\nSoon the last group in the parade was passing the reviewing stand.\r\nAnother brass band. They were moving with the speed of a glacier. 

A full\r\nfive seconds elapsed between each note of music. Everything was\r\nhappening in slow motion. On the reviewing stand the dignified hands\r\nwent up, agonizingly slow, to a final salute and they stayed there. The\r\ngreatest minds in the world stood motionless, unalterably still. Just as\r\neach wave of pandemonium had unfurled itself up Fifth Avenue during the\r\nparade, so now did silence take command.\r\n\r\nThe little boy tugged at his father\'s coat. "Daddy! Daddy," he\r\npleaded, "why has the parade stopped? I wan-na-go-home--" His\r\nwords came more slowly with each passing second, like a high\r\nspeed phonograph playing at thirty-three and a third r.p.m.\r\n"Dad-dy--why--don\'t--you--an--swer--me--Da--ddy--why--don\'t--" His\r\nfather never heard him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFifty miles above the Atlantic the fleet of spaceships hung suspended\r\nlike lanterns. In the lead ship the ant in charge of communications\r\nreported to the commander.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve just received the first communique from the advance guard, sir."\r\n\r\n"Read it to me.

"\r\n\r\nThe communications chief read from a large perforated paper.\r\n"Time--0600--mission accomplished. Manhattan island cut down the\r\nmiddle--immediate result of super-isonic rays; four million dead--rays\r\nspreading east and west--estimated time of rays\' full effect;\r\n0800--island will then be neutralized--awaiting further orders." The ant\r\nfolded the paper and looked up at the commander. "Shall I relay further\r\norders, sir?"\r\n\r\n"No." The commander of the ants paused and stroked his chin. "We\'re\r\nmoving in."\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\nThis etext was produced from _Amazing Science Fiction Stories_ May 1959.\r\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright\r\non this publication was renewed.

]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               He did not have the qualifications to go\r\n               into space--so he had them manufactured!\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was after oh-one-hundred when Kane arrived at my apartment.\r\nI checked the hall screen carefully before letting him in, too,\r\nthough the hour almost precluded the possibility of any inquisitive\r\npassers-by.\r\n\r\nHe didn\'t say anything at all when he saw me, but his eyes went\r\na bit wide. That was perfectly natural, after all. The illegal\r\nplasti-cosmetician had done his work better than well. I wasn\'t the\r\nsame person I had been.\r\n\r\nI led Kane into the living room and stood before him, letting him have\r\na good look at me.\r\n\r\n"Well," I asked, "will it work?"\r\n\r\nKane lit a cigarette thoughtfully, not taking his eyes off me.\r\n\r\n"Maybe," he said. "Just maybe."\r\n\r\nI thought about the spaceship standing proud and tall under the stars,\r\nready to go. And I knew that it had to work. It _had_ to.\r\n\r\nSome men dream of money, others of power. All my life I had dreamed\r\nonly of lands in the sky. The red sand hills of Mars, moldering in\r\naged slumber under a cobalt-colored day; the icy moraines of Io and\r\nCallisto, where the yellow methane snow drifted in the faint light\r\nof the Sun; the barren, stark seas of the Moon, where razor-backed\r\nmountains limned themselves against the star fields--\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, Kim; you\'re asking a hell of a lot, you know," Kane said.\r\n\r\n"It\'ll work," I assured him. "The examination is cursory after the\r\napplication has been acted on." I grinned easily under the flesh mask.\r\n"And mine has."\r\n\r\n"You mean Kim Hall\'s application has," he said.\r\n\r\nI shrugged. "Well?"\r\n\r\nKane frowned at me and blew smoke into the still air of the room. "The\r\nKim Hall on the application and you aren\'t exactly the same person. I\r\ndon\'t have to tell you that.

"\r\n\r\n"Look," I said. "I called you here tonight to check me over and because\r\nwe\'ve been friends for a good long time. This is important to me, Kane.\r\nIt isn\'t just that I _want_ to go. I _have_ to. 

You can understand\r\nthat, maybe."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Kim," he said bitterly. "I can understand. Maybe if I had your\r\nbuild and mass, I\'d be trying the same thing right now. My only\r\nchance was the Eugenics Board and they turned me down cold. Remember?\r\nSex-linked predilection to carcinoma. Unsuitable for colonial breeding\r\nstock--"\r\n\r\nI felt a wave of pity for Kane then. I was almost sorry I\'d called him\r\nover. Within six hours I would be on board the spaceship, while he\r\nwould be here. Earthbound for always. Unsuitable for breeding stock in\r\nthe controlled colonies of Mars or Io and Callisto.\r\n\r\nI thought about that, too. I knew I wouldn\'t be able to carry off\r\nmy masquerade forever. 

I wouldn\'t want to. The stringent physical\r\nexamination given on landing would pierce my disguise easily. But\r\nby that time it would be too late. I\'d _be_ there, out among the\r\nstars. And no Earthbound spaceship captain would carry my mass back\r\ninstead of precious cargo. I\'d stay. If they wanted me for a breeder\r\nthen--okay. In spite of my slight build and lack of physical strength,\r\nI\'d still be where I wanted to be. In the fey lands in the sky....\r\n\r\n"I wish you all the luck in the world, Kim," my friend said. "I really\r\ndo. 

I don\'t mean to throw cold water on your scheme. You know how few\r\nof _us_ are permitted off-world. Every one who makes it is a--" he\r\ngrinned ruefully--"a blow struck for equality." He savored the irony\r\nof it for a moment and then his face grew serious again. "It\'s just\r\nthat the more I think of what you\'ve done, the more convinced I am that\r\nyou can\'t get away with it. Forged applications. Fake fingerprints\r\nand X-rays. And _this_--" He made a gesture that took in all of my\r\nappearance. Flesh, hair, clothes. 

Everything.\r\n\r\n"What the hell," I said. "It\'s good, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Very good. In fact, you make me uncomfortable, it\'s so good. But it\'s\r\ntoo damned insane."\r\n\r\n"Insane enough to work," I said. "And it\'s the only chance. How do you\r\nthink I\'d stack up with the Eugenics Board? Not a chance. What they\r\nwant out there is big muscle boys. Tough breeders. This is the only way\r\nfor me."\r\n\r\n"Well," Kane said. "You\'re big enough now, it seems to me."\r\n\r\n"Had to be. Lots to cover up. Lots to add."\r\n\r\n"And you\'re all set? Packed and ready?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," I said. "All set."\r\n\r\n"Then I guess this is it." He extended his hand. I took it. "Good\r\nluck, Kim. Always," he said huskily. "I\'ll hear if you make it. All of\r\nus will. And we\'ll be cheering and thinking that maybe, before we\'re\r\nall too old, we can make it, too. And if not, that maybe our sons\r\nwill--without having to be prize bulls, either."\r\n\r\nHe turned in the doorway and forced a grin.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t forget to write," he said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe spacefield was streaked with the glare of floodlights, and the ship\r\ngleamed like a silvery spire against the desert night.\r\n\r\nI joined the line of passengers at the checking desk, my half-kilo of\r\nbaggage clutched nervously against my side. My heart was pounding with\r\na mixture of fear and anticipation, my muscles twitching under the\r\nunaccustomed tension of the plastiflesh sheath that hid me.\r\n\r\nAll around me were the smells and sounds and sights of a spaceport, and\r\nabove me were the stars, brilliant and close at hand in the dark sky.\r\n\r\nThe queue moved swiftly toward the checking desk, where a gray-haired\r\nofficer with a seamed face sat.\r\n\r\nThe voice of the timekeeper came periodically from the loudspeakers\r\naround the perimeter of the field.\r\n\r\n"_Passengers for the Martian Queen, check in at desk five. It is now H\r\nminus forty-seven._"\r\n\r\nI stood now before the officer, tense and afraid. This was critical,\r\nthe last check-point before I could actually set foot in the ship.\r\n\r\n"_It is now H minus forty-five_," the timer\'s metallic voice said.\r\n\r\nThe officer looked up at me, and then at the faked photoprint on my\r\npapers.\r\n\r\n"Kim Hall, age twenty-nine, vocation agri-technician and hydroponics\r\nexpert, height 171 centimeters, weight 60 kilos. Right?

"\r\n\r\nI nodded soundlessly.\r\n\r\n"Sums check within mass-limits. Physical condition index 3.69.\r\nFertility index 3.66. Compatibility index 2.99." The officer turned to\r\na trim-looking assistant. 

"All check?"\r\n\r\nThe uniformed girl nodded.\r\n\r\nI began to breathe again.\r\n\r\n"Next desk, please," the officer said shortly.\r\n\r\nI moved on to the medics at the next stop. A gray-clad nurse checked my\r\npulse and respiration. She smiled at me.\r\n\r\n"Excited?" 

she asked. 

"Don\'t be." She indicated the section of the\r\nchecking station where the breeders were being processed. "You should\r\nsee how the bulls take it," she said with a laugh.\r\n\r\nShe picked up an electrified stamp. "Now don\'t worry. 

This won\'t hurt\r\nand it won\'t disfigure you permanently. But the ship\'s guards won\'t let\r\nyou aboard without it. Government regulations, you know. We cannot load\r\npersonal dossiers on the ships and this will tell the officers all they\r\nneed to know about you. Weight limitations, you see.

"\r\n\r\nI almost laughed in her face at that. If there was one thing all Earth\r\ncould offer me that I wanted, it was that stamp on my forehead: a\r\npassport to the stars....\r\n\r\nShe set the stamp and pressed it against my forehead. I had a momentary\r\nfear about the durability of the flesh mask that covered my face, but\r\nit was unnecessary. The plastiskin took the temporary tattoo the way\r\nreal flesh would have.\r\n\r\nI felt the skin and read it in my mind. I knew exactly what it said.\r\nI\'d dreamed of it so often and so long all my life. My ticket on the\r\n_Martian Queen_. My pass to those lands in the sky.\r\n\r\n     CERT SXF HALL, K. RS MART QUEEN SN1775690.\r\n\r\nI walked across the ramp and into the lift beside the great tapering\r\nhull of the rocket. My heart was singing.\r\n\r\nThe timer said: "_It is H minus thirty-one_."\r\n\r\nAnd then I stepped through the outer valve, into the _Queen_. The\r\nair was brisk with the tang of hydrogenol. Space-fuel. The ship was\r\nalive and humming with a thousand relays and timers and whispering\r\ngenerators, readying herself for space.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI lay down in the acceleration hammock and listened to the ship.\r\n\r\nThis was everything I had wished for all my life. To be a free man\r\namong the stars. It was worth the chances I had taken, worth the lying\r\nand cheating and danger.\r\n\r\nThe conquest of space had split humanity in a manner that no one could\r\nhave foreseen, though the reasons for the schism were obvious. They\r\nhinged on two factors--mass and durability. Thus it was that some\r\nremained forever Earthbound while others reached for the sky. And\r\nbureaucracy being what it was, the decision as to who stayed and who\r\nwent was made along the easy, obvious line of demarcation.\r\n\r\nI and half the human race were on the wrong side of the line.\r\n\r\nFrom the ship\'s speakers came the voice of the timer.\r\n\r\n"_It is H minus ten. Ready yourselves for the takeoff._"\r\n\r\nI thought of Kane and the men I had known and worked with for half of\r\nmy twenty-nine years. They, too, were forbidden the sky. Tragic men,\r\nreally, with their need and their dream written in the lines of pain\r\nand yearning on their faces.\r\n\r\nThe speaker suddenly snapped:\r\n\r\n"_There is an illegal passenger on board! All persons will remain in\r\ntheir quarters until he is apprehended! Repeat: there is an illegal\r\npassenger on board! Remain in your quarters!_"\r\n\r\nMy heart seemed to stop beating. Somehow, my deception had been\r\nuncovered. How, it didn\'t matter, but it had. 

And the important thing\r\nnow was simply to stay on board at all costs. A space ship departure\r\ncould not be delayed. The orbit was computed. The blastaway timed to\r\nthe millisecond....\r\n\r\nI leaped to the deck and out of my cubicle. A spidery catwalk led\r\nupward, toward the nose of the ship. Below me I could hear the first\r\nsounds of the search.\r\n\r\nI ran up the walk, my footsteps sounding hollowly in the steel shaft. A\r\nbulkhead blocked my progress ahead and I sought the next deck.\r\n\r\nThe timer said: "_It is H minus six_."\r\n\r\nIt was a passenger deck. 

I could see frightened faces peering out of\r\ncubicles as I ran past. Behind me, the pursuit grew louder, nearer.\r\n\r\nI slammed open a bulkhead and found another walk leading upward toward\r\nthe astrogation blisters in the topmost point of the _Queen_.\r\n\r\nBehind me, I caught a glimpse of a ship\'s officer running, armed with a\r\nstun-pistol. My breath rasped in my throat and the plastiskin sheath on\r\nmy body shifted sickeningly.\r\n\r\n"_You there! Halt!_" The voice was high-pitched and excited. I flung\r\nthrough another bulkhead hatch and out into the dorsal blister. I\r\nseemed to be suspended between Earth and sky. The stars glittered\r\nthrough the steelglass of the blister, and the desert lay below,\r\nstreaked with searchlights and covered with tiny milling figures. The\r\nwarning light on the control bunker turned from amber to red as I\r\nwatched, chest heaving.\r\n\r\n"_It is H minus three_," the timer said. "_Rig ship for space._"\r\n\r\nI slammed the hatch shut and spun the wheel lock. I stood filled with\r\na mixture of triumph and fear. They could never get me out of the\r\nship in time now--but I would have to face blast away in the blister,\r\nunprotected. A shock that could kill....\r\n\r\nThrough the speaker, the captain\'s talker snapped orders: "_Abandon\r\npursuit! Too late to dump him now. Pick him up after acceleration is\r\ncompleted._" And then maliciously, knowing that I could hear: "_Scrape\r\nhim off the deck when we\'re in space._ That _kind can\'t take much_."\r\n\r\nI felt a blaze of red fury. _That_ kind. The Earthbound kind! I wanted\r\nto live, then, more than I had ever wanted to live before. To make a\r\nliar out of that sneering, superior voice. To prove that I was as good\r\nas all of them.\r\n\r\n"_It is H minus one_," said the timer.\r\n\r\nOrders filtered through the speaker.\r\n\r\n"_Outer valves closed. Inner valves closed._"\r\n\r\n"_Minus thirty seconds. Condition red._"\r\n\r\n"_Pressure in the ship. One-third atmosphere._"\r\n\r\n"_Twenty seconds._"\r\n\r\n"_Ship secure for space._"\r\n\r\n"_Ten, nine, eight_--"\r\n\r\nI lay prone on the steel deck, braced myself and prayed.\r\n\r\n"_Seven, six, five_--"\r\n\r\n"_Gyros on. Course set._"\r\n\r\n"_Four, three, two_--"\r\n\r\nThe ship trembled. A great light flared beyond the curving transparency\r\nof the blister.\r\n\r\n"_Up ship!_"\r\n\r\nA hand smashed down on me, crushing me into the deck.\r\n\r\nI thought: _I must live. I can\'t die. I won\'t die!_\r\n\r\nI felt the spaceship rising. I felt her reaching for the stars. I was\r\na part of her. I screamed with pain and exaltation. The hand pressed\r\nharder, choking the breath from me, stripping the plastiskin away in\r\nlong, damp strips.\r\n\r\nDarkness flickered before my eyes. I lay helpless and afraid and\r\ntransfigured with a joy I had never known before.\r\n\r\nDistorted, half-naked, I clung to life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen I opened my eyes, they were all around me. They stood in a\r\nhalf-circle, trim, uniformed. Their smooth faces and cropped hair\r\nand softly molded bodies looked strange against the functional steel\r\nangularity of the astrogation blister.\r\n\r\nI staggered to my feet, long strips of plastic flesh dangling from me.\r\n\r\nThe _Queen_ was in space. I was in space, no longer Earthbound.\r\n\r\n"Yes," I said, "I lived! Look at me!"\r\n\r\nI stripped off the flesh mask, peeled away the red, full lips, the long\r\ntransformation.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve done it. Others will do it, too. Not breeders--not brainless\r\nornaments to a hyper-nymphoid phallus! Just ordinary men. Ordinary men\r\nwith a dream. You can\'t keep the sky for yourselves. It belongs to all\r\nof us."\r\n\r\nI stood with my back to the blazing stars and laughed at them.\r\n\r\n"In the beginning it was right that you should be given priority\r\nover us. For centuries we kept you in subjection and when the Age of\r\nSpace came, you found your place. Your stamina, your small stature,\r\neverything about you fitted you to be mistresses of the sky....\r\n\r\n"But it\'s over. Over and done with. We can all be free--"\r\n\r\nI peeled away the artificial breasts that dangled from my chest.\r\n\r\nI stood swaying drunkenly, defiantly.\r\n\r\nThey came to me, then. They took me gently and carried me below, to the\r\ncomfort of a white bunk. They soothed my hurts and nursed me. For in\r\nspite of it all, they were women and I was a man in pain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


"\r\n\r\n"You\'re right." Gregson touched his belt-stud, giving the signal that\r\ncalled all five crewmen to hand. They appeared quickly--Lasseux,\r\nBeveridge, Golovunoff. Silently, Gregson pointed through the view-plate\r\nat the newcomer.\r\n\r\nAfter a long look Beveridge shook his head. "That didn\'t come from\r\nEarth," the Englishman said. "Not unless they\'ve developed an entirely\r\nnew drive principle. And look at the design...."\r\n\r\n"That\'s an alien spaceship, all right," Lasseux said.\r\n\r\n"From the stars," added Golovunoff. A cold chill seemed to sweep\r\nthrough the space satellite as he spoke the words.\r\n\r\nQuietly Gregson said, "We\'d better go out there and see what\'s inside.\r\nSince Lal and I saw the ship first, we\'ll be the ones to go look."\r\n\r\n"No," said Golovunoff. "I wish to go also."\r\n\r\n"I\'d rather like to get first look too," said Beveridge.\r\n\r\n"I think we\'d all better go," Lasseux suggested. "The station can\r\noperate without us for a while. 

And we\'ll never agree on who\'s to go,\r\neh?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFive figures in spacesuits clustered about the alien ship. At\r\nclose range its iridescent skin looked other-worldly and vaguely\r\nfrightening, gleaming purple and green and dull-bronze by moonlight. A\r\nquartz window gave a view of the ship\'s interior.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see anyone in there," said Gregson. "You?

"\r\n\r\n"Looks empty to me," commented Beveridge.\r\n\r\n"Empty! Impossible!" said Lasseux vehemently. "Empty spaceships do not\r\npilot themselves across the void to Earth. Empty spaceships do not\r\ncomplicatedly moor themselves outside a space satellite\'s airlock.\r\nEmpty spaceships...."\r\n\r\n"That\'s enough, Lasseux," growled the Russian. "Whether it makes sense\r\nor no, that spaceship\'s empty."\r\n\r\n"Let\'s find the hatch," suggested Lal. "Perhaps there\'s someone injured\r\ninside, out of the line of sight."\r\n\r\nThe five Earthmen covered the surface of the ship, looking for an\r\nexterior hatch control. Beveridge found it first--a narrow lever\r\nextruding a few inches from the skin of the alien vessel. He called\r\nto the others, then yanked down on the lever. The hatch pivoted back,\r\nopening into an airlock.\r\n\r\nThere was the usual moment of Alphonse-Gaston as the five crewmen\r\njockeyed for position, none willing to let any of the others get ahead\r\nof him on anything. Then Lasseux slipped through and into the alien\r\nspaceship, followed by Gregson and Beveridge almost simultaneously, and\r\nthen Golovunoff and Lal.\r\n\r\nThe ship _was_ empty.\r\n\r\nThere was not the slightest sign of life. The five men roamed through\r\nthe vessel, noting the utterly alien control-panel, the strange\r\nfurnishings, the peculiar fixtures and appurtenances. But the ship was\r\nvoid of life.\r\n\r\nFinally they returned to the Wheel and, puzzled, discussed the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n"It makes no sense," objected Lasseux. The small Frenchman was plainly\r\nobsessed with the inconsistency of the thing. "The ship crosses the\r\ninterstellar void ... alone? Can remote control extend so far?"\r\n\r\n"Looks like it did," said Gregson.\r\n\r\n"Impossible!" Lasseux sputtered.\r\n\r\n"In any case," said Beveridge, "we have a prize--a gift from the stars.\r\nAn alien spaceship, free and without strings of any kind. We should\r\nnotify Earth of our find."\r\n\r\n"Do you suppose," said Lal, "that the pilot of that ship may be around\r\nyet?"\r\n\r\n"Huh?" From Gregson and Beveridge at the same time.\r\n\r\n"What I mean is, suppose that pilot is not like you and me--suppose,\r\nthat is, that he is invisible? Perhaps he is still aboard his ship, and\r\nwe passed over him unknowing? 

Or perhaps he has come right in here with\r\nus and listens to our very words?"\r\n\r\nGregson shuddered. "You\'ve got a wild imagination, Lal. But we have\r\nenough problems on our hands without worrying about ghosts from outer\r\nspace."\r\n\r\n"I said not ghosts--"\r\n\r\n"Enough," boomed Golovunoff. "We can continue this silly quarrel\r\nindefinitely. Let us assume, since we see no one and nothing aboard the\r\nship, that it arrived empty. And therefore that it is ours for study."\r\n\r\n"Do empty ships moor themselves to airlock hatches?" asked the\r\nFrenchman sarcastically. "I tell you Lal\'s right--there must have been\r\nintelligence guiding that ship!"\r\n\r\nGregson shook his head. 

"No. 

Listen to me, will you? We built this\r\nsatellite station jointly, as a global watch-station. But does that\r\nmean that everything the satellite discovers is to be shared equally?"\r\n\r\n"Of course," said Beveridge.\r\n\r\n"Then how do we divide that spaceship into five equal parts? Whose\r\ncountry gets it?

"\r\n\r\nThere was a moment\'s silence. Then Lal said, "We\'ll turn it over to\r\nthe United Nations. They can let all nations examine it freely.

"\r\n\r\nFor once there was general agreement. "Good idea," Gregson said\r\napprovingly, and then the five went back to their tasks aboard the\r\nsatellite.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe satellite had been in space less than a year. The development\r\nof spaceflight had put an end to the possibility of war on Earth by\r\nbringing into being a watchdog for the uneasy planet.\r\n\r\nPut a satellite in the sky. Arm it with enough fission-fusion bombs\r\nto blast any country to flinders. Man it with a squad chosen from\r\nthe leading countries of the world and let them keep watch over one\r\nanother. Any threat of aggression on the mother planet could easily be\r\nsquashed by the more potent threat of blazing vengeance from the skies.\r\nThe satellite was the guardian of the world\'s peace.\r\n\r\nThe five men chosen to be the first crew were almost ideal for\r\nthe job--sensitive, intelligent men, skilled in the techniques of\r\nspaceflight, loyal to the countries of their birth. There wouldn\'t be\r\nany chance of collusion among them, of a conspiracy against one country\r\nor against Earth itself, as some feared.\r\n\r\nTheir tasks for the hours immediately after the discovery of the\r\nstrange spaceship were mostly routine; Lal dictated a comprehensive\r\nreport on the spaceship and beamed it to United Nations Headquarters on\r\nEarth, while Beveridge and Golovunoff, spacesuited, filmed the alien\r\nship from every conceivable angle, inside and out. Lasseux and Gregson\r\ntended to the workings of the satellite, overseeing the cybernetic\r\ngovernors which had the actual responsibility of operating the big\r\nwheel in the sky.\r\n\r\nLasseux was cook that night, according to the strict rotation that had\r\nbeen set up. The men ate a strange meal; their spirits seemed oddly\r\ndampened by the spaceship that had so unpredictably come into their\r\nmidst. Lal\'s words preyed on them despite themselves. Suppose there had\r\nbeen an invisible alien aboard that ship? Suppose he lurked aboard the\r\nwheel this very moment?\r\n\r\n"Suppose," said Beveridge suddenly, "that alien ship was an invasion\r\nscout."\r\n\r\n"What\'s that?" Gregson asked.\r\n\r\n"What I mean is, the advance guard of an invasion force. The alien\r\nfinds the satellite and, being telepathic, parks here a while to\r\nsee what\'s going on." He giggled self-consciously. "I\'m speaking\r\nimaginatively, of course. The alien moors here and reads our minds;\r\nfinds out we have a load of bombs here that can blow up the works down\r\nthere. So he comes drifting out of the ship and takes over someone of\r\nus here. When no one else is looking--_poof!_--Earth is destroyed like\r\nthat!" Again Beveridge giggled.\r\n\r\nGregson looked at him sourly. "You better leave those crazy magazines\r\nalone, Beveridge."\r\n\r\nBut Lasseux interjected, "We should devote careful attention to what he\r\nhas said. 

There may be a grain of truth in it. After all, _who moored\r\nthe spaceship_?"\r\n\r\nA moment\'s silence. Then the Russian said, "Assuming one of us is an\r\nalien--not that I believe Beveridge\'s fanciful story--how would we\r\nknow? Until Earth is destroyed, that is?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s just it," said Lal gloomily. "We _wouldn\'t_ know. Not until it\r\nwas too late."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat began as Beveridge\'s dinner-table joke soon became an\r\nearnestly-held belief. Perhaps it was the strain of life aboard the\r\nsatellite, 10,000 miles above the Earth\'s surface. Perhaps the tensions\r\nof a year\'s isolation from the rest of humanity were taking their toll.\r\nBut, from a dinner-table jest, the concept soon became a source of\r\nserious discussion. And tension.\r\n\r\nTension wrapped cold fingers around them as the days passed. They\r\nagreed to operate in teams, never to let one out of another\'s sight,\r\nalways to keep constant watch ... for there was no way of telling which\r\nof them harbored in his body or his mind Earth\'s potential destroyer.\r\n\r\nTwo days passed this way, and a third. Then Lal went for a walk in\r\nspace--without a suit.\r\n\r\n"He cracked," Gregson said, staring at the Indian\'s corpse. "This crazy\r\nalien business--it just broke him apart."\r\n\r\n"Yes," Lasseux said moodily. "The tension ... the looking and\r\nspying ... he couldn\'t take it any more. Our first casualty. 

But not\r\nthe last, I fear."\r\n\r\nBeveridge and Gregson brought Lal\'s body in--it was orbiting around the\r\nWheel--and a brief funeral service was conducted. The Indian\'s body was\r\nfed to the atomic converters that ran the station and consumed in an\r\ninstant\'s blaze of light.\r\n\r\nLasseux radioed Earth and gave them a full account of the tragedy. He\r\nwas told that a replacement for Lal would be on his way within a week\r\nor two.\r\n\r\n"Now there are just four of us," he said, turning from the radio. "It\r\nwill make keeping watch easier. I will team with Golovunoff for the\r\nrest of the day; you two English-speakers can work together."\r\n\r\nThey did. 

It was a cold, cheerless day. The little Indian had\r\neveryone\'s spirits.\r\n\r\nThen Beveridge suggested, "Perhaps Lal was the one carrying the alien.\r\nWhen he discovered the truth he ran out into space, killing himself and\r\nthe alien...?"\r\n\r\n"No," Gregson said. "Why would he wait so long? Lal was the type to do\r\nsuch a thing the moment he found out. Besides, the alien wouldn\'t be\r\nbothered by space if it has no body."\r\n\r\n"Damn; you\'re right. Just trying to cheer things, old man. Just\r\ntrying...."\r\n\r\nSuddenly the sound of a pistol-shot echoed through the chambers of\r\nthe space satellite. The crewmen always carried pistols as safeguards\r\nagainst one another.\r\n\r\n"You hear that?" Gregson said.\r\n\r\nBeveridge nodded.\r\n\r\nMoments later Lasseux came running into the chamber, muttering\r\nexcitedly and incoherently to himself in French. He carried a smoking\r\ngun in his hand. Gregson and Beveridge immediately drew but Lasseux\r\nraised his other hand and dropped the gun.\r\n\r\n"Calm yourself!" Gregson ordered, shaking Lasseux roughly. "Calm down!\r\nWhat happened!"\r\n\r\nThe flow of French finally ceased. Lasseux made a visible effort to\r\nmaster himself and said. "Golovunoff--the Russian--_he_ was the alien!"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Transcriber\'s Note: This paragraph seemed to be a printer\r\nerror. 

A portion was removed for better readability. The original text\r\nof this paragraph was "The flow of French finally ceased. Lasseux made\r\na visible effort added an exotic spark to the group that was missing\r\nnow and the tragic nature of his death dampened to master himself and\r\nsaid. "Golovunoff--the Russian--_he_ was the alien!"]\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"I saw him change shape," Lasseux gasped. "He seemed to waver for a\r\nmoment when he thought I wasn\'t looking. The edges of his body blurred.\r\nIt was awful! Then he saw me--and I shot him!"\r\n\r\n"Is he dead?"\r\n\r\n"Yes! Yes! I sealed off the chamber, so the alien couldn\'t escape if\r\nit\'s still alive." Lasseux was trembling violently. Beveridge and\r\nGregson, pale, stared at him.\r\n\r\n"Two men dead," Gregson said. "And we don\'t know if we\'ve killed the\r\ncreature yet. Or if there really is a creature," he added more silently\r\nto himself.\r\n\r\nThen--"Great God! _Lasseux!_"\r\n\r\nGregson gaped. The Frenchman was ... _wavering_. It was the only way to\r\ndescribe it. He seemed to be blurring and shifting mistily, but only\r\nfor an instant.\r\n\r\nAn instant was long enough. Gregson had his gun out and pumped three\r\nshots into Lasseux\'s body. The Frenchman looked incredulously at him a\r\nmoment, then crumpled.\r\n\r\nGregson took four steps back and let the gun drop from his nerveless\r\nfingers. "It was a trick," he said in a half-whisper. "He killed the\r\nRussian and made up the story about him--but he couldn\'t control his\r\nown wavering! Lucky thing I got him first, wasn\'t it?" He turned to\r\nBeveridge for confirmation, but the Englishman was gazing at him\r\nsternly, coldly, almost angrily.\r\n\r\n"He _was_ wavering, wasn\'t he?" Gregson asked. "You saw it too--that\r\nsort of blurring?" The American knotted his hands tensely. "Well, now\r\nthe alien\'s dead--unless it\'s taken a new host. You don\'t think that\'s\r\npossible, do you, Beveridge? I mean, if you shoot the body it\'s in, can\r\nit hop to the next person like that? Do you think...."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the Englishman. 

"I think so."\r\n\r\nHe was wavering.\r\n\r\nBut _he_ held the gun.\r\n\r\nGregson yelled once and charged madly toward Beveridge. The bullet\r\ncaught him in mid-run and sent him spinning back toward the crumpled\r\ncorpse of Lasseux. Coldly, Beveridge fired twice more, then stopped\r\nwavering.\r\n\r\nTen minutes later, the rain of bombs began to shower down on Earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCurt felt the airship going out of control as he passed over a rock\r\nspattered stretch of sand. Automatically he looked for a smooth place\r\nto land and steered the bucking ship for it. The jolt of the landing\r\ntriggered the ejector seat and in a second he was hurtling through the\r\nair away from the explosion of the damaged vehicle. Just before he\r\nblacked out, he thought--almost calmly--"a good hundred and fifty miles\r\nfrom the colony."\r\n\r\nWhen he regained consciousness, night was passing and the first of the\r\nthree suns was peeking over the horizon. Curt lay still for a while,\r\nafraid to find out what might be wrong with him. And the rescue ship\r\ncould take anything from an hour to a week to find him. He moved his\r\nhead to discover if there might be anything left of his ship; he saw\r\nnothing but pieces.\r\n\r\n"Well," he said aloud, "so much for that." He reached back gingerly\r\nand undid the seat straps. 

Carefully, he sat up and began to ease his\r\nweight onto his feet. A sharp twinge of pain in his knee dropped him\r\nback to a sitting position. 

He probed at the knee but found no broken\r\nbones.\r\n\r\n"Well," he said again, quietly. The colony leaders had had very little\r\nto offer in the way of survival. Rule number 1: Mark the crash site and\r\nyour direction of travel. Number 2: Get into shade before the combined\r\nheat of the three suns boils your blood. Number 3: Carry your pistol\r\nfor protection against liquid scorpions, and always save the last\r\npellet for yourself.\r\n\r\nCurt glanced about nervously at the thought of the liquid\r\nscorpions--the one form of animal life the colonist had found on this\r\nmineral-rich planet. Liquid scorpions were enormous masses of clear,\r\njellyish liquid that oozed forward across the rock and sand with\r\nremarkable speed. A liquid scorpion changed shape constantly, its mass\r\nshooting out legs wherever they were needed. Only the eyes, fixed in a\r\nbulge over the center of its mass, and the almost-solid, curved stinger\r\nthat arched over its back remained the same.\r\n\r\nThe first landing party had stood transfixed while one of the crew was\r\nattacked and absorbed before their eyes. Clear, the scorpion had been\r\nalmost invisible to them until it flowed about the navigator\'s legs and\r\nparalyzed him with the swaying stinger. When his frantic struggles had\r\nceased, the creature flowed over his body and absorbed it. As the party\r\nwatched, the clearness slowly became a thin, dark red, and the body\r\ncould no longer be seen.\r\n\r\nAvengers had poured out of the ship after the giant scorpion, which\r\nreared back, tripling its height and halving its width. At the apex,\r\nthe two protruding eyes bulged at them and the stinger swayed back and\r\nforth, reaching out and retreating. Explosive pellets fired into its\r\nflesh were absorbed with a slurping sound. The captain in the end, had\r\nknelt and taken careful aim at the right eye, behind which was the\r\nonly unreddened sector of the mass. When the right eye disappeared,\r\nthe clear area spurted out of the hole and drained over the jelly-like\r\nsurface. Slowly, silently, the first of the liquid scorpions died.\r\n\r\nCurt counted the pellets in his belt--an even hundred. Enough ... if\r\nhe managed to keep out of sight and had good enough aim. 

He surveyed\r\nthe surrounding countryside. Farther along the valley were shaded caves\r\nwhere he could find protection once he had marked his course.\r\n\r\nIf he could walk that far.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nXen came sluggishly awake, feeling the warmth penetrate his mass. The\r\ntime of heat had come again, the time to search for what would halt the\r\nhunger that ached through every inch of him.\r\n\r\nSlowly, his cold-stiffened mass flowed forward from its hiding place in\r\nthe warmth-holding sand. The heat melted the stiffness out of him and\r\nhe began to slide across the sand, his alert senses functioning again.\r\nSense of touch led him across rocks and over ridges easily. The touchy\r\nsense of vibration waited apprehensively for movement that would\r\nshake the ground. And the third sense, the one that could be called\r\nonly "sense" or "sense of knowing," functioned as always without his\r\nunderstanding. Today, this third sense told Xen, was different from\r\nother days.\r\n\r\nExtra-cautious, Xen oozed over rocky barriers in the direction that his\r\n"sense" told him held food. Once he felt a slight tremor, and in terror\r\nflooded out over the rock into thin, transparent nothing. 

He waited\r\nseveral degrees of heat, but no further movement touched the sensitive\r\nreceivers in his mass.\r\n\r\nA falling rock, he decided, collecting himself and starting forward\r\nagain. He slithered down rocky walls, pouring almost like water when\r\nthe drop was long and drawing together at the bottom. When his feeling\r\nof touch warned him of the shade whose coolness might solidify him and\r\nleave him helpless in the open, he drew hurriedly away and changed\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nFinally, he reached an open spot that was likely to contain food.\r\nHis mass ached for something to consume, but he flooded himself thin\r\nagain and waited, feeling. There was no vibration through the surface,\r\nnor did his "sense" tell him of anything other than the possibility\r\nof nourishment. Xen hesitated only a degree of heat before bubbling\r\nexcitedly into the open space.\r\n\r\nTouch found him something edible almost immediately--he flowed around\r\nand over it, absorbing it hungrily. His mass dissolved it almost\r\nimmediately and ached for more. He slid thin, reaching out in every\r\ndirection until contact was made, then absorbing the food instantly and\r\nmoving on.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCurt, lying in meager shade that would be gone in half an hour when\r\nthe third and largest sun rose, first saw the movement when it was on\r\nthe rocks. His already frayed nerves gave a frightened leap. He lay\r\nperfectly still. Where he had seen the movement on the rocky shelf\r\nthere was now nothing.\r\n\r\nThe nothing moved forward.\r\n\r\nCurt shivered. He was certain he was seeing nothing, and yet his eyes\r\nwere trying to tell him there was movement. When it reached the flat\r\nplace and flowed swiftly forward, he realized that it was a liquid\r\nanimal and was suddenly pointedly conscious of the weight of the pistol\r\nagainst his hip.\r\n\r\nHe watched carefully for the eyes and the stinger, but saw none. That\r\nfrightened him. If he could not find the brain, he had no mark to\r\nshoot at. As he watched, the liquid creature flowed against one of the\r\nhardy, sun-browned plants and jerked in reaction. Instantly, it flowed\r\nover the plant and absorbed it. The liquid turned momentarily a thin\r\nbrownish green and then cleared again.\r\n\r\nCurt watched it with narrowed eyes. It was just possible that this\r\ncreature ate only plant life. The colonists had realized that the\r\nliquid scorpions had fed upon something else before they arrived, but\r\nno one had been able to discover what that something was.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nXen was in the process of absorbing a plant when the vibration sense\r\nalerted him. Terror shot through him and he spread thinly across thirty\r\nfeet of ground and lay motionless, his "sense" telling him frantically\r\nthat a Sting was hunting nearby.\r\n\r\nHe lay for many degrees of heat, waiting. Sense of vibration and\r\nknowing both told him that the Sting was approaching, but uncertainly,\r\nsearching. Then both senses reacted startledly to a new danger on the\r\nother side. New movement! A new feeling that his "sense" could not\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\nThe Sting was approaching at an angle that would inevitably bring it in\r\ncontact with Xen. Absorption was the penalty for being caught. Xen was\r\nresigned to death, for he could not possibly escape the Sting. And now\r\nthere was this new sensation on the other side of him. Whatever it was,\r\nhe had no idea; but likely it was as voracious as the Sting.\r\n\r\nNow the new thing vibrated jerkily around him and stopped between him\r\nand the Sting. The vibrations from the eager Sting accelerated rapidly,\r\neagerly, as it flowed over the ground. Then, for no reason except that\r\nthe new creature had moved slightly, the Sting recoiled. The jerks were\r\nplainly recorded through the earth to Xen; and as he felt the heavy\r\njar, his "sense" told him that the danger from the Sting was past. The\r\nSting was dead.\r\n\r\nXen drew himself together and considered that.\r\n\r\nThe new thing vibrated jerkily the place from which Xen had first felt\r\nit move. It must be solid as the rocks to move so jerkily, Xen thought.\r\nThe Sting-killer drew itself back under the enormous rock and ceased to\r\nmove.\r\n\r\nCuriosity drew Xen forward, fear dragged him back. He spread thin and\r\ndrew together with uncertainty. At last, he oozed forward carefully\r\nuntil he reached the rock. The Sting-killer was pressed back under the\r\nrock, where touch told Xen a tiny amount of the cold-carrying shade\r\nremained. Xen puzzled at that. Why should this creature hide from the\r\nlife-giving suns?\r\n\r\nHe reached out and absorbed a plant thoughtfully. This thing was\r\ndifferent from the liquid structures he had always known. 

If it was\r\nsolid where they were liquid, perhaps then it was also opposite in its\r\nneeds. Maybe this Sting-killer needed cold instead of heat.\r\n\r\nWhile Xen was considering this difficult thought, the Sting-killer\r\nbegan to move again.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCurt gasped. The shade was gone. The third sun was reaching long rays\r\nunder the rock to sear his already-burned flesh. He had to find more\r\nshade.\r\n\r\nMovements were very painful. 

His lips were cracking and his face had\r\nblackened. The injured knee had swollen inside the protective suit; it\r\nthrobbed and ached. Dazedly, he pulled himself to his feet.\r\n\r\nOn the rock beside him, spread an inch thick, was the almost-invisible\r\ncreature he had been forced to circle in order to stop the liquid\r\nscorpion. He wondered tiredly if it was dangerous. It lay completely\r\nmotionless, just as it had when the liquid scorpion had approached. So\r\nit was probably more afraid of him than he was of it. He turned away.\r\nThere appeared to be shade down the valley--perhaps a mile, perhaps\r\nthree. Too much for him, he knew, but he set out, feeling the sun beat\r\ncruelly at him, crying out when the pain in his knee forced him to\r\ncatch his balance against the sun-heated rock.\r\n\r\nHe knew without turning that the liquid creature was following him,\r\nstopping when he stopped, starting when he started. When he knew he\r\ncould go no farther and felt his knee give weakly to his weight, he saw\r\nit ooze forward and began to flow over his legs. He tried to reach his\r\npistol, but it seemed so far away.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nXen, following the Sting-killer curiously, put together all that he had\r\nlearned. This creature was different from himself. 

It needed shade. It\r\nhad killed his enemy, which was possibly also its own enemy. Now it was\r\ntrying to reach the shade, but its progress grew steadily slower.\r\n\r\nHe considered that progress. The only thing he could liken it to was\r\none of his own kind, caught out in the time of cold, trying to reach\r\nthe heat-retaining sands, slowly congealing into a solid mass and\r\ndying. 

This, then, was the reverse process. Perhaps the Sting-killer\r\nwould become liquid after a certain degree of heat.\r\n\r\nXen\'s sense of knowing warned him gently about too much wandering\r\nin the open, where countless Stings could be hiding. He drew back,\r\nunwilling to stop following this interesting creature. The Sting-killer\r\nvibrated the ground and lay still suddenly. Xen waited for a "sense" of\r\ndeath but none came. This might be for the new thing a stage similar to\r\nthat when one of Xen\'s own kind became unable to move from the cold,\r\nbut still lived and feared.\r\n\r\nCaught between his own fear and a very strange sensation that he could\r\nnot interpret, Xen waited a degree of heat. Then he oozed forward and\r\nspread himself over the still shape, until it floated within him. When\r\nhe flowed over one part, the thing struggled pitiably. Xen drew back\r\nstartedly and the movement ceased. Carefully, he retraced his course,\r\nleaving the part free. This time there was no struggling.\r\n\r\nSpurred by fear of Stings, Xen began to flow across the land, letting\r\nhis "Sense" guide him to the coldness. He slithered up slopes, poured\r\nover steep drops, always collecting himself in time to catch his burden.\r\n\r\nHe found a place that would stay cold until the next time of heat\r\nand halted in front of it, his anxiety evident in the way he spread\r\nand collected himself, back and forth. At last he inched forward,\r\nfeeling the agony of the cold bite into every cell. Bunching himself\r\nbehind the Sting-killer, he made it flow along him until it broke\r\nfree and lay upon the shaded rock. Xen drew back as hurriedly as his\r\nalready-sluggish mass would allow. He spread thin across the earth and\r\nlet the heat liquefy his body again....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was when the time of cold was only a few degrees away that Xen felt\r\nthe heavy vibration which nearly made him dissolve with fear. It lasted\r\nfor a few degrees and then weakened and made only a small tremor. Now\r\nmany smaller vibrations reached him, like many creatures moving about.\r\nThe tremors spread out, moving slowly toward the rocky valley.\r\n\r\nXen lay still trying to identify the vibrations. They were not those of\r\nStings. As they approached, he recognized them as resembling in great\r\nnumbers the creature he had put upon the rock.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCurt imagined he heard voices, an incoherent babble of them. He\r\nstruggled to sit up, but there was an incredible weight on his chest.\r\n\r\n"Lie still," a voice said clearly, and his mind echoed, "Still ...\r\nstill ... still...."\r\n\r\nHe struggled again. "Liquid," he croaked painfully, "liquid animal ...\r\nliquid...." The weight was still there. He heard one last voice say,\r\n"Poor guy, he must have run into scorpions."\r\n\r\nThen he was lifted and it seemed as though the lifting would never\r\ncease.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nXen waited until the small tremor was gone and the great vibration had\r\nroared and disappeared. He knew by the sense of emptiness that the\r\nSting-killer had gone back to his own kind. 

For a moment he felt very\r\nalone, though he knew the sand was full of Xens.\r\n\r\nSlowly, he drew himself together. For the time of cold was but a few\r\ndegrees away, and he must seek the warm sands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            Why bother building a time machine when there\'s\r\n       something much easier to find right in your own kitchen?\r\n\r\n\r\nSomebody someday will make a study of the influence of animals on\r\nhistory. Although not as famous as Mrs. 

O\'Leary\'s cow, Mrs. 

Graham\'s\r\ncat should certainly be included in any such study. It has now been\r\ndefinitely established that the experiences of this cat led to the\r\nidea of quick-frozen people, which, in turn, led to the passage of\r\nZeritsky\'s Law.\r\n\r\nWe must go back to the files of the Los Angeles newspapers for 1950\r\nto find the story. In brief, a Mrs. Fred C. Graham missed her pet\r\ncat on the same day that she put a good deal of food down in her\r\nhome deep-freeze unit. She suspected no connection between the two\r\nevents. The cat was not to be found until six days later, when its\r\nowner went to fetch something from the deep-freeze. Much as she loved\r\nher pet, we may imagine that she was more horror than grief-stricken\r\nat her discovery. She lifted the little ice-encased body out of the\r\ndeep-freeze and set it on the floor. Then she managed to run as far as\r\nthe next door neighbor\'s house before fainting.\r\n\r\nMrs. Graham became hysterical after she was revived, and it was several\r\nhours before she could be quieted enough to persuade anybody that she\r\nhadn\'t made up the whole thing. She prevailed upon her neighbor to go\r\nback to the house with her. In front of the deep-freeze they found a\r\nsmall pool of water, and a wet cat, busily licking itself. The neighbor\r\nsubsequently told reporters that the cat was concentrating its licking\r\non one of its hind legs, where some ice still remained, so that she,\r\nfor one, believed the story.\r\n\r\nA follow-up dispatch, published a week later, reported that the cat was\r\nunharmed by the adventure. Further, Mrs. Graham was quoted as saying\r\nthat the cat had had a large meal just before its disappearance; that\r\nas soon after its rescue as it had dried itself off, it took a long\r\nnap, precisely as it always did after a meal; and that it was not\r\nhungry again until evening. It was clear from the accounts that the\r\nlife processes had been stopped dead in their tracks, and had, after\r\ndefrosting, resumed at exactly the point where they left off.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is unfair to put all the responsibility on one luckless\r\ncat. 

Had such a thing happened anywhere else in the country, it would\r\nhave been talked about, believed by a few, disbelieved by most, and\r\nforgotten. 

But as the historic kick of Mrs. O\'Leary\'s cow achieved\r\nsignificance because of the time and place that it was delivered,\r\nso the falling of Mrs. Graham\'s cat into the deep-freeze became\r\nsignificant because it occurred in Los Angeles. There, and probably\r\nonly there, the event was anything but forgotten; the principles it\r\nrevealed became the basis of a hugely successful business.\r\n\r\nHow shall we regard the Zeritsky Brothers? As archvillains or pioneers?\r\nIn support of the latter view, it must be admitted that the spirit\r\nof inquiry and the willingness to risk the unknown were indisputably\r\ntheirs. However, their pioneering--if we agree to call it that--was,\r\nequally indisputably, bound up with the quest for a fast buck.\r\n\r\nSome of their first clients paid as high as $15,000 for the initial\r\nfreezing, and the exorbitant rate of $1,000 per year as a storage\r\ncharge. The Zeritsky Brothers owned and managed one of the largest\r\nquick-freezing plants in the world, and it was their claim that\r\nconverting the freezing equipment and storage facilities to accommodate\r\nhumans was extremely expensive, hence the high rates.\r\n\r\nWhen the early clients who paid these rates were defrosted years later,\r\nand found other clients receiving the same services for as little\r\nas $3,000, they threatened a row and the Zeritskys made substantial\r\nrefunds. By that time they could easily afford it, and since any\r\npublicity about their enterprise was unwelcome to them, all refunds\r\nwere made without a whimper. $3,000 became the standard rate, with $100\r\nper year the storage charge, and no charge for defrosting.\r\n\r\nThe Zeritskys were businessmen, first and last. Anyone who had the fee\r\ncould put himself away for whatever period of time he wished, and no\r\nquestions asked. The ironclad rule that full payment must be made in\r\nadvance was broken only once, as far as the records show.\r\n\r\nA certain young man had a very wealthy uncle, residing in Milwaukee,\r\nwhose heir he was, but the uncle was not getting along in years fast\r\nenough. The young man, then 18 years old, did not wish to waste the\r\n"best years of his life" as a poor boy. He wanted the money while\r\nhe was young, but his uncle was as healthy as he was wealthy. The\r\nZeritskys were the obvious answer to his problem.\r\n\r\nThe agreement between them has been preserved. They undertook to\r\nservice the youth without advance payment. They further undertook to\r\nwatch the Milwaukee papers until the demise of the uncle should be\r\nreported, whereupon they would defrost the boy. In exchange for this,\r\nthe youth, thinking of course that money would be no object when he\r\ncame out, agreed to pay double.\r\n\r\nThe uncle lived 17 years longer, during which time he seems to have\r\nforgotten his nephew and to have become deeply interested in a mystic\r\nsociety, to which he left his entire fortune. The Zeritskys duly\r\ndefrosted the boy, and whether they or he were the more disappointed\r\nis impossible to imagine. They never forgot the lesson, and never made\r\nanother exception to their rule.\r\n\r\nHe, poor fellow, spent the rest of his life, including the best\r\nyears, paying off his debt which, at $3,000 plus 17 years at $100 per\r\nyear, and the whole doubled, amounted to $9,400. The books record his\r\nslow but regular payments over the next 43 years, and indicate that\r\nhe had only $250 left to pay when he died. We may, I think, assume\r\nthat various underworld characters who were grateful ex-clients of\r\nthe Zeritskys were instrumental in persuading the boy to keep up his\r\npayments.\r\n\r\nCriminals were the first to apply for quick-freezing, and formed the\r\nmainstay of the Zeritskys\' business through the years. What more easy\r\nthan to rob, hide the loot (except for that all-important advance\r\npayment), present yourself to the Zeritskys and remain in their\r\nadmirable chambers for five or ten years, emerge to find the hue and\r\ncry long since died down and the crime forgotten, recover your haul and\r\nlive out your life in luxury?\r\n\r\nDue to the shady character of most of their patrons, the Zeritskys kept\r\nall records by a system of numbers. Names never appeared on the books,\r\nand anonymity was guaranteed.\r\n\r\nLaw enforcement agents, looking for fugitives from justice, found no\r\nway to break down this system, nor any law which they could interpret\r\nas making it illegal to quick-freeze. Perhaps the truth is that they\r\ndid not search too diligently for a law that could be made to apply.\r\nAs long as the Zeritskys kept things quiet and did not advertise or\r\nattract public attention, they could safely continue their bizarre\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nCity officials of Los Angeles, and particularly members of the police\r\nforce, enjoyed a period of unparalleled prosperity. Lawyers and other\r\nexperts who thought they were on the track of legal means by which to\r\nliquidate the Zeritsky empire found themselves suddenly able to buy a\r\nranch or a yacht or both, and retire forever from the arduous task of\r\nearning a living.\r\n\r\nEven with a goodly part of the population of Los Angeles as permanent\r\npensioners, the Zeritsky fortune grew to incredible proportions. By the\r\ntime the Zeritsky Brothers died and left the business to their sons, it\r\nwas a gold mine, and an inexhaustible one at that.\r\n\r\nDuring these later years, the enterprise began to attract a somewhat\r\nbetter class of people. Murderers and other criminals continued to\r\nfurnish the bulk of the business, but as word of this amazing service\r\nseeped through the country, others began to see in it an easy way of\r\nsolving their problems. They were encouraged, too, by the fact that\r\nthe process was painless, and the firm completely reliable. 

There were\r\nno risks, no accidents, no fatalities. One could, in short, have\r\nconfidence in the Zeritskys.\r\n\r\nSoon after Monahan\'s great exposure rocked the nation, however, many of\r\nthese better-type clients leaped into print to tell their experiences.\r\n\r\nOne of the most poignant stories came from the daughter of a Zeritsky\r\nclient. Her father was still, at the age of one hundred and two,\r\npassionately interested in politics, but the chances of his lasting\r\nuntil the next election were not good. 

The daughter herself suggested\r\nthe deep freeze, and he welcomed the idea. He decided on a twenty year\r\nstay because, in his own words, "If the Republicans can\'t get into the\r\nWhite House in twenty years, I give up." Upon his return, he found that\r\nhis condition had not been fulfilled. His daughter described him as\r\nutterly baffled by the new world. He lived in it just a week before he\r\nleft it, this time for good. 

She states his last words were, "How do\r\nyou people stand it?"\r\n\r\nSome professional people patronized the Zeritskys, chiefly movie stars.\r\nAfter the expose, fan magazines were filled with accounts of how the\r\nstars had kept youthful. The more zealous ones had prolonged their\r\nscreen lives for years by the simple expedient of storing themselves\r\naway between pictures. We may imagine the feelings of their public\r\nupon discovering that the seemingly eternal youth of their favorites\r\nwas due to the Zeritskys and not, as they had been led to believe, to\r\nexpensive creams, lotions, diet and exercise. There was a distinctly\r\nunfavorable reaction, and the letter columns of the fan magazines\r\nbristled with angry charges of cheating.\r\n\r\nBut next to criminals, the majority of people who applied for\r\nquick-freezing seems to have been husbands or wives caught in\r\ninsupportable marital situations. Their experiences were subsequently\r\nwritten up in the confession magazines. It was usually, the husband who\r\nfled to Los Angeles and incarcerated himself for an appropriate number\r\nof years, at the end of which time his unamiable spouse would have\r\ndied or made other arrangements. If we can believe the magazines, this\r\nscheme worked out very well in most cases.\r\n\r\nThere was, inevitably, one spiteful wife who divined her husband\'s\r\nintentions. By shrewd reasoning, she figured approximately the number\r\nof years he had chosen to be absent, and put herself away for a like\r\nperiod. In a TV dramatization rather pessimistically entitled _You\r\nCan\'t Get Away_, the husband described his sensations upon being\r\ndefrosted after 15 years, only to find his wife waiting for him, right\r\nthere in the reception room of the Zeritsky plant.\r\n\r\n"She was as perfectly preserved as I was," he said. "Every irritating\r\nhabit that had made my life unbearable with her was absolutely intact."\r\n\r\nThe sins of the fathers may be visited on the sons, but how often\r\nwe see repeated the old familiar pattern of the sons destroying the\r\nlifework of the fathers! The Zeritsky Brothers were fanatically\r\nmeticulous. They supervised every detail of their operations, and kept\r\ntheir records with an elaborate system of checks and doublechecks. They\r\nwere shrewd enough to realize that complete dependability was essential\r\nto their business. A satisfied Zeritsky client was a silent client. One\r\ndissatisfied client would be enough to blow the business apart.\r\n\r\nThe sons, in their greed, over-expanded to the point where they could\r\nnot, even among the four of them, personally supervise each and every\r\ndetail. A fatal mistake was bound to occur sooner or later. When it\r\ndid, the victim broadcast his grievance to the world.\r\n\r\nThe story appeared in a national magazine, every copy of which was sold\r\nan hour after it appeared on the stands. Under the title _They Put the\r\nFreeze on Me!_ John A. Monahan told his tragic tale. At the age of 37,\r\nhe had fallen desperately in love with a girl of 16. 

She was immature\r\nand frivolous and wanted to "play around" a little more before she\r\nsettled down.\r\n\r\n"She told me," he wrote, "to come back in five years, and that started\r\nme thinking. In five years I\'d be 42, and what would a girl of 21 want\r\nwith a man twice as old as her?"\r\n\r\nJohn Monahan moved in circles where the work of the Zeritskys was\r\nwell known. Not only did he see an opportunity of being still only 37\r\nwhen his darling reached 21, but he foresaw a painless way of passing\r\nthe years which he must endure without her. Accordingly, he presented\r\nhimself for the deep-freeze, paid his $3,000 and the $500 storage\r\ncharge in advance, and left, he claimed, "written instructions to let\r\nme out in five years, so there\'d be no mistakes."\r\n\r\nNobody knows how the slip happened, but somehow John A. Monahan, or\r\nrather the number assigned to him, was entered on the books for 25\r\nyears instead of five years. Upon being defrosted, and discovering\r\nthat a quarter of a century had elapsed, his rage was awesome. Along\r\nwith everything else, his love for his sweetheart had been perfectly\r\npreserved, but she had given up waiting for him and was a happy mother\r\nof two boys and six girls.\r\n\r\nMonahan\'s accusation that the Zeritskys had "ruined his life" may be\r\ntaken with a grain of salt. He was still a young man, and the rumor\r\nthat he received a hundred thousand for the magazine rights to his\r\nstory was true.\r\n\r\nAs most readers are aware, what has come to be known as "Zeritsky\'s\r\nLaw" was passed by Congress and signed by the President three days\r\nafter Monahan\'s story broke.\r\n\r\nSeventy-five years after Mrs. Graham\'s cat fell into the freezer,\r\nit became the law of the land that the mandatory penalty for anyone\r\napplying quick-freezing methods to any living thing, human or animal,\r\nwas death. Also, all quick-frozen people were to be defrosted\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nLos Angeles papers reported that beginning on the day Monahan\'s story\r\nappeared, men by the thousands poured into the city. They continued\r\nto come, choking every available means of transport, for the next two\r\ndays--until, that is, Zeritsky\'s Law went through.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the date, and remember that due to the gravity of the\r\ninternational situation, a bill had just been passed drafting all men\r\nfrom 16 to 60, we realize why Congress had to act.\r\n\r\nThe Zeritskys, of course, were among the first to be taken. Because of\r\ntheir experience, they were put in charge of a military warehouse for\r\ndehydrated foods, and warned not to get any ideas for a new business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            


]\r\n\r\n\r\n"You have no choice," the patrolman said. "The Council sends for you."\r\n\r\nHe moved across the veranda of Heric\'s cottage, bulking dark against\r\nthe sky-glow of Nyark the first city. On the slope of lawn below stood\r\nhis copter, its beetle-black shell glistening faintly in the starshine.\r\n\r\nHeric stood rigid with alarm in his doorway, still holding the book\r\nhe had been reading. The night-wind ruffling his hair and the homely\r\nsounds from the kitchen where Marta prepared their evening meal made\r\nhis danger doubly fantastic.\r\n\r\n"They\'ve found out somehow about my dreams," Heric said. "They\'ll put\r\nme through the adjuster and I\'ll come out of it--someone else. 

I won\'t\r\ngo!"\r\n\r\nHe was a mild man, overseer of the cereal grain fields outside Nyark\r\nthe first city, holding the confidence of his superiors and the respect\r\nof his workers. He and Marta had been happy in the quiet eddy of their\r\nisolation, until the dreams came.\r\n\r\nThe patrolman took a gleaming silver shock-cone from his belt. "I am\r\nsorry, Arnol Heric. You must come with me."\r\n\r\nStark panic made Heric drop his book and strike out wildly, smashing a\r\nfist into the officer\'s face. The patrolman staggered back, teetered\r\nfor balance on the veranda\'s edge and fell heavily. The sound of his\r\nhead striking the stone walkway below was as definite as the thud of a\r\ndropped melon.\r\n\r\nHeric went down the steps and knelt to feel the man\'s limp wrist. There\r\nwas no pulse. He put an ear to the slack lips, and there was no breath.\r\nShock numbed him and drove his thoughts into strange, tortured channels.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve killed him," he said.\r\n\r\nA sound caught his ear and he looked up to see Marta on the dark\r\nveranda above him, her face a pale oval blur with enormous,\r\nfright-widened eyes. "I didn\'t intend this to happen, Marta. I--I lost\r\nmy head."\r\n\r\nShe came down at once and put a soft hand on his shoulder. "Of course,\r\nof course, darling. 

Here, let me help you."\r\n\r\nTogether they lifted the patrolman\'s body into the copter\'s control\r\nseat, where it lolled bonelessly against the instrument panel. Heric\r\ntouched a button and the machine rose and soared eastward on a random\r\ncourse away from Nyark the first city.\r\n\r\nThey watched, holding hands like uneasy children, until it was lost\r\nagainst the stars. Then they went inside to the light and warmth of\r\ntheir cottage.\r\n\r\nHeric voiced the thought first: "They\'ll send for me again tomorrow,\r\nwhen he doesn\'t return."\r\n\r\nHe had again the ominous sensation, felt a dozen times in as many days,\r\nof being very close to understanding the strange auguries that had so\r\ntroubled his sleep of late. For a moment he hovered on the brink of\r\ncomplete comprehension before his fearful thought recoiled, leaving him\r\nuneasy and bewildered.\r\n\r\nWhen he slept the dream came more strongly than before.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The sere globe of Earth spun below him, frightfully riven by the\r\nhalf-healed wounds of some ancient cataclysm. Dull seas steamed and\r\nrain fell and vegetation crept across the scars, but there was life in\r\none place only._\r\n\r\n_There was a ruined city like a forest of standing shards, rising stark\r\nand cold against a desolate sky. A horde of silent figures poured\r\nthrough its streets, bent upon a myriad errands whose purposes he might\r\nhave guessed but dared not--he found himself one of the throng, yet his\r\ndread of understanding hid their intent as a mist might have obscured\r\ntheir faces. The crowd moved always eastward, its thousand faces rapt\r\nin impossible ecstasy. His own expectancy mounted to an unbearable\r\npitch, stifling him with the promise of total understanding. He had\r\nonly to follow them and--_\r\n\r\nHe awoke to find himself crouched on the cold floor of his bedroom,\r\ndrenched with perspiration and trembling violently from the strain of\r\nfighting back the monstrous concept toward which his dream had carried\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nMarta\'s voice was urgent in his ears. Marta\'s hands tugged at his arm,\r\nher breath was warm on his damp face. "Arnol, wake up! _Arnol!_"\r\n\r\nFor an instant he had an indescribable sense of being infinitely\r\nmultiplied, as if this moment were reproduced forever, a single frame\r\nin a succession that stretched endlessly before and behind him. Then\r\nthe dream tilted and swept away and he let Marta lead him, unresisting,\r\nback to bed.\r\n\r\nFor a long time he lay shivering in the darkness, his face hidden\r\nagainst her warm shoulder. And at last, when the tension had gone out\r\nof him, he slept again.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey came for him at daybreak, four burly patrolmen with Council\r\ninsignia on their helmets and silver shock-cones in their hands. Heric\r\nlooked back as he entered their copter to see Marta on the verandah,\r\nlovely in the soft disarray of her too-early rising, her eyes bright\r\nand blind with unshed tears.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll come back," he called. "It\'s going to be all right!"\r\n\r\nWhen the copter rose he waved at her, buoyed up unexpectedly by the\r\nring of certainty he had managed to force into his voice. He had a\r\nlast glimpse of Marta before distance and the morning mists hid her, a\r\nsmall, forlorn figure with raised face staring after him, her belted\r\nhouse-robe fluttering in the wind.\r\n\r\nThey sank through the ordered vastness of Nyark the first city, into\r\na bustle and rush that was symbolic of the Council\'s will to restore\r\nNyark--and finally Earth--to their former glory. Heric was led to a\r\nquiet chamber where the Council, in their deep crescent of seats behind\r\nthe Leader\'s throne, awaited him.\r\n\r\nHe had seen them before only in newscasts, when it had awed him a\r\nlittle to think that in their hands lay the destiny of a world in\r\nrebirth. He was surprised now to feel that their wrinkled parchment\r\nfaces and thin bodies, hidden under sleeveless blue robes, lent them a\r\nfutile anonymity rather than the distinction he had expected. _Why_, he\r\nthought, _they look like scrawny, earthbound birds._\r\n\r\n"Why am I here?" Heric demanded. 

Rebellion grew in him, roughening his\r\nvoice. "I have broken no law, nor have I been lax in my overseeing. I\r\nprotest this adjustment to what you call normalcy."\r\n\r\n"Yet you must endure it, Arnol Heric," the Leader said. A rustle of\r\nassent whispered through the robed Council. "You should not have defied\r\nour messenger. It may be too late now."\r\n\r\nAnger swelled Heric\'s demand. 

"What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: He felt the breath of madness touch him....]\r\n\r\nHis answer was a great, cloudy bubble that sprang from nowhere about\r\nhim. The Council vanished behind its milky haze. There was a brief\r\nsensation of motion, and after that--nothing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_He was in the void of his dreams again, imprisoned in darkness.\r\nBut there was a difference--the dull globe of Earth spun faint and\r\nmisty, half-seen through an obscuring curtain. A smooth, hypnotic\r\nthought-current flowed into his mind from the adjuster, commanding him,\r\nwarring with the half-sensed truth that still sought his awareness._\r\n\r\n_"You are Arnol Heric, overseer of cereal plantings. You have had\r\nno disturbing dreams. Forget, Arnol Heric. There is no need for\r\nalarm...."_\r\n\r\n_There was a long struggle before his will fought clear, and he knew\r\nthat the Leader\'s fear of being too late had been realized. The pitted\r\nEarth-sphere grew plain, the desolate city sharpened and drew near. He\r\nwalked the thronged streets and turned his face toward the east, and\r\nthis time he did not repulse the truth when it lay before him._\r\n\r\n_There was a silent room where a figure reclined laxly in a chair made\r\nmassive by its crystal maze of shining coils. Two guards flanked the\r\nchair watchfully, and in it sat--_\r\n\r\n_Himself._\r\n\r\nAnger shook him like a terrible wind, without warning. It was all a\r\nmonstrous farce, then--he was the center of it all, and they had hidden\r\nhim in his overseer\'s niche to blind him to reality.\r\n\r\nHe opened his eyes in the adjuster, pushing the futile thought-current\r\nfrom his mind. The guards stiffened at his movement, their silver\r\nshock-cones ready.\r\n\r\n"I know myself now," Heric said. He stood up, shaking off the web of\r\ncrystal contacts from the adjuster. 

"And I know you. 

Put away your\r\nuseless weapons."\r\n\r\nThey dropped their cones and stood with lowered eyes, waiting his\r\npleasure with a deference that made his lip curl. He left the room\r\nwithout a backward look, knowing they would warn the Council but having\r\nno need now for secrecy.\r\n\r\nHe went down a wide-arched corridor, striding with sure step to the\r\ncity\'s heart. He found the power source at ground level, in a vast\r\ndim cavern full of soft-purring machines. He singled out the great\r\noperations board with its master switch that controlled the city\'s\r\nlife--and in his path he found the Leader and his council, shielding\r\nthe control from him with the massed crescent of their bodies.\r\n\r\n"Stand back," Heric commanded.\r\n\r\nThe Council stirred uneasily, but did not break.\r\n\r\n"Hear us out, Arnol Heric," the Leader begged. "Remember that we, being\r\nnot-human, yet have human emotions. 

We are the end result of the robot\r\nrace men created to serve them in ages past, and you are right when\r\nyou suppose that we may not defy you because we are your property. But\r\nthere is a thing which you do not know, hidden from you even in your\r\ndreams for your own safety. 

Stay your hand, Master."\r\n\r\nThe sound of Heric\'s laughter echoed emptily through the vast room.\r\n\r\n"Stay my hand and let you adjust me into submission again? Let you send\r\nme back to planting wheat, drowning my identity in ignorance? I know\r\nthe human race is almost dead--I know that you hide the truth from the\r\nfew of us who remain because you think us doomed to extinction. You\r\nwould bury us in ignorance and rule in our stead as if you were men and\r\nwe your servants."\r\n\r\n"_We_ are the servants," the Leader said. "Yet you would immobilize us.\r\nWhy?"\r\n\r\n"Because I would rather know my fate and meet it without your\r\nmeddling," Heric answered. "Because I do not believe that my race\r\ncan ever die completely. I shall stop you in your tracks like the\r\nmechanical things you are, and I shall find the others of my people who\r\nare left and start life over with them. And this time we shall know\r\nbetter than to build machines!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"We have no desire to perpetuate ourselves," the Leader said. "We were\r\ncreated to serve humanity, and to insure our obedience to the love\r\nof men was made our strongest instinct. Without men our life would be\r\nan endless torture of loneliness, for we can be happy only in your\r\nhappiness. We hid the truth from you, and kept you busy outside Nyark\r\nthe first city, to protect your sanity."\r\n\r\nHeric took a forward step. 

"Back, all of you!"\r\n\r\nThey drew aside to let him pass. The Leader knelt as Heric brushed by\r\nhim, and the Council knelt with averted faces behind him. Their sigh\r\nwhispered through the great room.\r\n\r\n"Wait, Arnol Heric. Do you know that we have made you immortal?"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "Wait, Arnol Heric. 

Do you know that we have made you\r\nimmortal?"]\r\n\r\nHe paused with his hands upon the master control, disturbed by a\r\nresurgence of that indescribable extension he had felt on waking from\r\nhis dream. Angrily he shook it off, bracing himself.\r\n\r\nHe wrenched open the switch.\r\n\r\nThe machine-murmur died. The cavernous chamber stilled until Heric\'s\r\nheart beat loud in the tomblike silence. The Council knelt motionless,\r\nlike even rows of cold statuary.\r\n\r\nHe turned from them and went through the hushed room and out into the\r\nstreets of Nyark the first city. Silence lay before him. Vehicles stood\r\nunpowered, drivers frozen. In the shops the crowds hovered motionless\r\nlike static, three-dimensional shadows.\r\n\r\nHe went swiftly through the dead city with his face turned toward the\r\nhills. The silence bore him down with an implacable weight, and the\r\ndesire to escape it grew upon him until he found himself running,\r\ndodging wildly in and out among stalled vehicles and frozen pedestrians.\r\n\r\nHe reached the city\'s edge, but the sun and wind of open country did\r\nnot dispel his oppression. The sun was as silent as the city, and the\r\nbreeze was a drear lament in his ears. Loneliness crept at his heels\r\nlike a black, timorous hound; he felt as if he were the only living\r\nthing in a dead and forgotten world. Panic claimed him.\r\n\r\nIt was noon when he reached his cottage. He crawled up the verandah\r\nsteps, spent and panting, and found the silence with him here even in\r\nhis last retreat.\r\n\r\n"Marta!" he croaked. He pulled himself erect, clutching at the arched\r\ndoorway for support.\r\n\r\n"Marta!"\r\n\r\nHe had been so sure that there would be other men. He had been able to\r\nfend off madness back there on the plain, only because he had known\r\nthat Marta was here waiting for him....\r\n\r\nHe found her standing in the silent living room, her still face turned\r\ntoward the door through which he must come when he returned. She wore\r\nthe clinging, colorful gown he had liked best, and her bright, fair\r\nhair was carefully arranged as if she were on the point of going out.\r\n\r\nHer lashes were lowered as if in sleep, and he had the instant\r\nconviction that she had closed her lids to hide the mechanical luster\r\nof her eyes from him when he should come and find her.\r\n\r\n"_Marta_," he whispered.\r\n\r\nHe sagged against the entrance arch, with the bitter sound of the\r\nLeader\'s words in his ears: "We can be happy only in your happiness...."\r\n\r\nNot one of them was human, not even Marta. He was the last man on Earth.\r\n\r\nAnd he was immortal.\r\n\r\nThis was the thing that had been hidden from him even in his dream,\r\nlest he go mad. This silence that pressed him down was the silence of\r\neternity.\r\n\r\nHe was alone in a world of death and dust, and would be alone forever.\r\n\r\nHe felt the breath of madness touch him. He heard the Council\'s sighing\r\nwhisper of "_Immortal_ ..." and he recalled the eerie sensation of\r\ninfinite multiplication that had come to him when he pulled open the\r\nmaster switch.\r\n\r\nHe thought: _How many times has this happened?
