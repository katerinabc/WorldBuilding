]\r\n\r\n\r\nMaybe a guy shouldn\'t believe everything he hears, but the trouble with\r\nsome people is that they don\'t even believe a true story. Let me buy\r\nyou a beer and tell you about it.\r\n\r\nAfter working some years in the baggage room of the local depot, I\r\ndecided to transfer to the train service, and made application for it.\r\nThe application was approved. I was sent to the city offices for the\r\ncourse of study and training which all trainmen undergo, and after\r\na time I was sent out as brakeman on a freight. I stayed for a year\r\nand a half. Then I succeeded in being assigned as head brakeman on a\r\nfast food special called The Red Ball Special. It made no stop between\r\nChicago and New York except for water and fuel. The big Diesel in which\r\nI rode as head brakie was a high-speed locomotive, used exclusively for\r\nhauling the food special.\r\n\r\nOur first stop was Detroit, where we cut off all but three cars, and\r\ntook on five more scheduled in New York at 9 the next morning. In New\r\nYork, I strolled along Broadway, gawking at the sights exactly like any\r\nother yokel.\r\n\r\nAfter a twelve-hour rest, the return trip began. I stood in my place in\r\nthe big Diesel till we had cleared for the main line, and then settled\r\nback to enjoy the ride.\r\n\r\nIt was close to midnight. 

I sat at the cab window half asleep, my\r\nsenses somewhat dulled by the steady rhythm of train movement. I\'d\r\nfinished an extra good cigar and had started to doze off when the\r\nengineer gave a low moan and toppled from his seat to the floor of the\r\ncab.\r\n\r\nThe fireman, much against the rules, but feeling safe with the engineer\r\nand myself to watch in his place, had gone back to inspect a suspected\r\nleaking air hose without waiting for the train to stop.\r\n\r\nI got the engineer back on his seat. He was dead.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI tied him in place and then began pulling on the whistle cord like\r\nmad. It was not my work to operate a Diesel. 

I\'d not troubled to learn.\r\n\r\nI wondered why the fireman did not get back. I was going to jump,\r\nalthough I didn\'t like my chances at that speed, when I suddenly\r\ndiscovered a strange man in the cab with me. He was a pretty ordinary\r\nlittle guy, except for a wild, shaggy head of hair.\r\n\r\n"You chump!" he squeaked at me. "Maybe next time you\'ll obey the rules,\r\nand not sneak by without finding out things! See that short rod with\r\nthe spring-clip? Squeeze that clip and pull the rod back. 

Move, you\r\nfathead!"\r\n\r\nI did as the shaggy man told me, and felt the speed of the train\r\nslacken slightly as the power went off.\r\n\r\n"Now, that brass handle sticking out of that pipe--move it to the right\r\nslowly. _Slowly_, you dunce!"\r\n\r\nNine cars and the Diesel ground slowly to a stop. The wheels shuddered\r\nand skidded slightly because of my inexperienced hand, but the train\r\ndid stop.\r\n\r\nThe stranger nodded in satisfaction. "When you get back home, bone up\r\non things. But right now you go take a close look at the manifest card\r\non the sides of the second and third cars...."\r\n\r\nI jumped to the ground to go back and look at the second and third\r\ncars. As I passed the rear of the Diesel I saw why the fireman had not\r\ncome back to the engine cab. All that was left of him was the lower\r\npart of his body. He had slipped, caught one foot and gone under the\r\nwheels.\r\n\r\nI came to the second car and read the manifest label. My hair stood\r\nstraight up.\r\n\r\nThe cars were marked:\r\n\r\n                                Danger\r\n                               DYNAMITE\r\n                           _High Explosive_\r\n\r\nThe shaggy man was at my side. "You\'ve got questions. 

But let me ask\r\nyou one: Ever hear a story about how if you travel back to the time of\r\nan ancestor and you let him die you never get born?

"\r\n\r\n"What about it?" I said.\r\n\r\n"It\'s true," said the shaggy man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OLD SHAG ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!)

Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
