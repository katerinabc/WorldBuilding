]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            They awoke after ages of hiding--to emerge into\r\n            a world richer than they had dared to dream of!\r\n\r\n\r\nRik\'s first impressions were an uncomfortable chill creeping along his\r\nbare flesh, and a bright milky swirling of light that encompassed his\r\nentire vision. He shivered and blinked his eyes a few times, and then\r\nthe swirling settled down and became the vault. The chill, he realized,\r\nwas due to the body warmth being methodically sucked away by the cold\r\nslab on which he lay. Another shiver brought a gasp of breath into his\r\nlungs, and then he was wide awake.\r\n\r\nWhen he sat up and swung his legs over the side, the interior of the\r\nvault began swirling again. He had to grip the edge of the slab to keep\r\nfrom falling. The air was humid, much too humid, and he could taste the\r\nprickly presence of carbon dioxide when he breathed. "The pump," he\r\nmumbled, dropping to the floor on feet that he could barely control.\r\n"Something\'s happened to the pump."\r\n\r\nHe pushed himself determinedly erect, then stumbled down the long\r\ncorridor between the other slabs, hardly glancing at their silent\r\ntenants, until he got to Zina\'s. She lay still as death, not flicking\r\nso much as an eyelid, and her flesh was like frozen wax beneath his\r\nexploring fingers.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing he could do for her until he got the pump working\r\nagain....\r\n\r\nRik pushed away from the slab on which Zina lay, and went through the\r\narchway into the next chamber. Here another fifty of the group lay on\r\ntheir slabs, not so much as a muscle twitch betraying the fact that\r\nthey were all quite alive. It seemed only a few hours since he had lain\r\ndown on his slab in the other room and gotten his injection, but he\r\ncould not, for a dizzy moment, recall in which direction the pump lay.\r\nHis mind seemed to be plumbing dust-covered depths to dredge out his\r\nmemories, one by one.\r\n\r\nHe suddenly remembered the War. The war that had driven the group to\r\nbuild this place, to try and safeguard a handful from the holocaust\r\nthat would set fire to the surface of the world and turn the seas to\r\nsteam. Was it possible the war had passed? Or had it ever come!\r\n\r\nThere was no way to know without going outside--Wait! 

There was!\r\nRik thought hard, trying to get his sense of direction back. The\r\natom-powered clock that marked off months instead of minutes was in the\r\ncentral vault, where the elders slept. The other nine vaults ringed\r\nthat one, he recalled, veering at right angles to his first direction,\r\nwhich would have taken him on a circular tour of the nine vaults and\r\nback to his starting place again.\r\n\r\nThe archway to the vault of the elders was unaccountably blocked,\r\nand Rik realized suddenly that part of the ceiling there had fallen,\r\ncarried by some fault in the granite of the mountain itself. But that\r\nwas impossible! 

The elders had selected this site on the basis of the\r\nrigidity of the rocky strata that made it up. A fault could not have\r\noccurred for more years than Rik\'s own lifetime--\r\n\r\nOr had that many years passed already?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was no way of knowing; not until he had examined the clock. Rik\r\nmoved away from the blockade and made his way into the next vault, and\r\nthe next, finally finding an archway in the sixth vault from his own\r\nwhere the rock had not completely sealed the way into the elders\' vault.\r\n\r\nHere he had expected to find the air fresher, already having theorized\r\nthat the staleness elsewhere was due to the poor circulation occasioned\r\nby the blockaded central vault. But in fact the air there was even\r\nworse, and laden with an odor that made Rik suddenly afraid to see its\r\nsource.\r\n\r\nStill, he was the first to awake. It was up to him to try and save\r\nhimself and the others. Rik made an effort of will, and then squeezed\r\nthrough the narrow orifice into the main chamber. He looked once toward\r\nthe slabs holding the bodies of the elders, then quickly away. It was\r\ntrue. All were in advanced stages of corruption already.\r\n\r\nChoking, Rik went to the center of the high room and looked into the\r\nhorizontal face of the clock. The broad indicator arm was at its\r\nutmost numeral, and was pocked with rust. They\'d lain here beyond the\r\ntime-of-awakening by at least four times the years they\'d planned!\r\n\r\n"It can\'t be right," Rik gasped, his brain reeling for want of clean,\r\ncool air. "The mechanism has failed somehow." Afraid to think about it,\r\nhe tilted the clock up on its base until the pedestal which supported\r\nit lay on its side upon the floor. The square block of metal that\r\nbased the pedestal was now uptilted beyond the vertical, exposing a\r\ngaping trap in the floor. Rik did not like the tarnished look of the\r\nmetal underside of the pedestal-base, forged of an alloy supposed\r\nto be incorruptible. A sick thought took hold of his insides then,\r\nas he placed one foot upon the rocky staircase under the floor. The\r\nclock-indicator had halted at its utmost numeral.\r\n\r\nBut what if they\'d lain here even longer than that? There would be no\r\nway of knowing. No way at all.\r\n\r\nHe descended the staircase swiftly then, glad at least that the air\r\nwas better down in the pump chamber. "It would be, of course," he\r\nreminded himself, "if the pump went off, even. This air would never\r\nbe circulated, never have its chance to become corrupt with our\r\nexhalations." And then his musing was halted in midthought as he came\r\nupon the pump. Or upon what had been the pump.\r\n\r\nWhere rigid cylinders of gleaming metal had been, a few jagged teeth of\r\nbrown corruption lay in a circle. The pistons were no better, though\r\ntheir thickness had preserved more of their original shape despite the\r\ninroads of age, so they could be recognized for what they were--had\r\nbeen. The central shaft was a long mound of flaking dust on the floor\r\nbetween the path of the pistons, and the wall-sized mass of the\r\nfilters--woven of metal and powerful synthetic fibers--crumbled beneath\r\nthe pressure of his finger.\r\n\r\nHe sought and found the ponderous casing in which the engine-empowering\r\nradioactive element had lain, and its thick walls tore away like wood\r\npulp in his hands. The element, when he found it, was already become\r\ncold grey lead. And it had had a half-life of centuries....\r\n\r\nRik crumpled slowly to the floor, shutting his eyes, trying not to\r\nthink of the eons which must have passed while they all lay sleeping\r\nthe pseudodeath in the vaults. What might the world have become in the\r\ninterim!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA current of cool air suddenly touched his face. His head came up\r\ninstantly, his eyes seeking the source.\r\n\r\nA feathery motion of torn edges in the filter showed him that it came\r\nthrough the gap he had torn there. Rik sprang to his feet then, leaped\r\nat the filter and tore out chunks by the armful, letting the pulverized\r\nmaterial float in spinning clouds of dust motes behind him. The air\r\ngrew stronger, came faster, as he ripped away the corruption, and then\r\nhe could see the tunnel beyond.\r\n\r\nGasping at the effort--how long since he had eaten?--he staggered\r\nback from the opening then back up the stairs into the chamber of the\r\nelders. Now that his nostrils had been stimulated by the clean air the\r\nsmell of corruption was violently repelling; but he held his breath and\r\nran to the gap in the tumbled rock about the archway, and squeezed his\r\nway into the area of subsidiary vaults.\r\n\r\nWithout the pump in operation, the air could not circulate to this\r\npoint, but he hoped to drag some of his companions down to the torn\r\nfilter and revive them--then, with their help, bring the others.\r\n\r\nIt would be all right. They would be saved, as planned. He regretted\r\nthe loss of the elders. But no matter. 

They were but the rulers. He\r\nand the others were the chemists, the scientists, the engineers. New\r\nelderships could be created when they had become settled again, and\r\ncould rebuild their civilization.\r\n\r\nHe went to Zina\'s slab first. She would not be as much help as some of\r\nthe others, but Zina and he were too close for him to delay her revival\r\nany longer. Life was not worth having without Zina. He carried her out\r\nof the vault, through the gap and thick miasma of corruption, then down\r\ninto the pump chamber. Leaving her lying on her back, with the breeze\r\nruffling her hair about her face, Rik went back up for the next person.\r\n\r\nThree exhausting trips later, he sat among the bodies of his friends,\r\nlistening with joy to their returning quiver of breath and life. Zina\r\nwas the first to open her eyes. She seemed startled to find she was no\r\nlonger on the slab, and then joyous when her glance fell upon his eager\r\nface.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve done it!" she sighed. "We came through!" She tried to sit up,\r\nthen lay down heavily. "Rik--I\'m so weak...."\r\n\r\n"We need food, all of us," he said. "I\'m weak myself." He arose from\r\nhis crouch at her side and stared down the tunnel to the outer world.\r\n"I don\'t know what it\'s like out there," he said. "There may be no food\r\nat all. If the War was as devastating as predicted, it may be barren\r\nrock, burning sun and overall death.

"\r\n\r\n"How long--?" Zina began, and then her eyes fell upon the time-rotted\r\nhulk of the pump and she stopped, her face going pale. "As long as\r\nthat!" 

she whispered. "Oh, Rik! Do you think--?

"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll know when I\'ve looked," he said. Their eyes met for a long,\r\nsilent moment, then he turned and started up the tunnel.\r\n\r\nThree hundred strides brought him to the barrier, the thinly\r\nperforated shield of rock that had been left intact to hide the\r\nlocation of the vaults from their enemies. Rik put his shoulder to the\r\nshell. It cracked and fell away as he\'d thought it would, with weather\r\nand erosion having weakened it for centuries. Bright yellow moonlight\r\nlay all about the land outside. Incredibly fine sand was everywhere,\r\nbut a smell of fresh water and green growing things was mingled with\r\nthe night air. The region had not been desert when the vaults were\r\nconstructed. The War had left its mark of devastation here, Rik saw,\r\nlooking in vain for a trace of the magnificent towered city that had\r\nonce been just beyond this spot.\r\n\r\nHe shook off his dismay and set himself to the task for which he\'d\r\nemerged.\r\n\r\nThe animals had to be alive, yet, or they were doomed. He\'d always\r\nregretted the haste in their preparations that had precluded preparing\r\nsurvival vaults for the food animals. The best they\'d been able to do,\r\nbefore the Day of Devastation, was herd the stupid beasts into caves\r\nand pile the entrances with loose rock, hoping the animals would dig\r\nthemselves out only after the worst fury of the War had passed.... Rik\r\nthrew off the bitter memory, abruptly, as his ears detected a tiny buzz\r\nof sound.\r\n\r\nHe dropped to the ground and lay still, watching to see what sort of\r\nbeast would appear. It sounded larger than the animals he remembered.\r\n"I must be near a waterhole," he reasoned. "There\'s a pathway here,\r\nmade by many animals passing this way...." he mused, studying the\r\nnarrow, flattened track that he\'d spotted in the night-chilled sand.\r\n\r\nThen he saw something coming slowly up the trail, a thing much larger\r\nthan the animals he remembered.\r\n\r\nIt was a long moment before he realized what it was, and smiled. Then\r\nhe reached out his hands and had it. 

It buzzed loudly in his grip until\r\nhe pounded it to silence on a rock. By the time he\'d returned to the\r\npump chamber, he\'d managed to prise it open, but its contents--mangled\r\nby the smashing upon the rock--were barely fit to eat.\r\n\r\n"It\'s better than I could have hoped," he said to Zina, when they and\r\nthe others had picked the thing clean. "Life promises to be much more\r\nexciting, infinitely more sporting in this new age outside the vaults.\r\nWith care, we can survive until our engineers rig up some whip-rays and\r\nherding-claws again."\r\n\r\n"It _will_ be fun," Zina agreed, smiling with grim anticipation. "I\r\nenjoy a challenge in the hunt. 

Who\'d have thought the animals would\r\nhave come so _far_ from the caves!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was hours later that the bus company grew worried about their\r\nmissing vehicle, and started an investigation. But they could find no\r\ntrace of the bus, anywhere, and it remained a mystery until the day\r\neverybody suddenly knew what had happened.\r\n\r\nBut that was far too late.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE AWAKENING ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!)

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\xe2\x80\x99s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
