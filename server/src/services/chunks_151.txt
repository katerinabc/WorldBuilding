]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _His thin scream keened away in the distance._]\r\n\r\nHe was too late to stop them. Old Kaliz dropped his upraised arm, and\r\nat his signal the four naked under-priests flung the bound body of Gor\r\nZan over the precipice. Ortho heard his friend\'s thin scream keening\r\naway until it dwindled in the distance and the muted roar of the falls\r\nboiling at the cliff\'s bottom floated upward and drowned it.\r\n\r\nHe turned to run, but the horror of what he had seen numbed his limbs\r\nto nightmare slowness. Kaliz and the four under-priests caught him\r\nbefore he had taken a dozen steps.\r\n\r\n"You are still a neophyte," old Kaliz said gently. "You have only begun\r\nto learn, and so you cannot understand why Gor Zan had to die. 

The\r\nanswer lies there." He pointed a wrinkled hand to the Valley below.\r\n\r\nOver the heads of the four priests who squatted on the ledge outside\r\nthe priest-cave Ortho looked down into the Valley, the lush green miles\r\nof its even floor clothed in a faint rosy haze of vapor. The sun sat\r\nred upon the western wall; above the eastern rim the rising moon hung\r\nwarm and turquoise-blue, its great encircling ring pulsing like an aura\r\nof living light. Under its glow the Valley-haze turned violet and then\r\nblue, and on the heels of its rising came the faint elfin voices of the\r\nPeople, leaving their caves to play in the meadow.\r\n\r\nOrtho sat back upon his polished sitting-stone and met the\r\nhigh-priest\'s eyes defiantly.\r\n\r\n"There is no reason down there," he said sullenly. "It is only the\r\nPeople, coming out to play under the moon. You killed Gor Zan because\r\nhe was wiser than you, because he talked to the People and made clear\r\nto them things they did not understand before. You were jealous of him\r\nand you killed him lest he make your own wisdom seem small in the eyes\r\nof the People."\r\n\r\nKaliz sighed and seated himself stiffly on his own sitting-stone.\r\n\r\n"The young do not learn easily," he said. "But believe this,\r\nOrtho--your friend Gor Zan was a snare to the People and a deadly\r\nmenace to their way of life. We took him from them reluctantly and only\r\nas a last resort, before he could start the People again on the bloody\r\npath of ambition, progress and the Machine."\r\n\r\nOrtho cupped his still beardless chin in his hands and stared\r\ndisconsolately down into the blue-hazed Valley where the People played.\r\n\r\n"Empty talk," he said contemptuously. "Priest-talk--ambition, progress,\r\nthe Machine! I do not know the words. There is nothing but the Valley\r\nand the People, who have always been and who will always be. Your words\r\nhave no meaning.

"\r\n\r\n"I have taught these others," Kaliz murmured. The blue moonlight pulsed\r\nwarm across his wrinkled face, made his hooded eyes pools of reflected\r\nlight. 

"I can teach you, too. You would know these things soon, because\r\nyou are almost ready to read the Books; but I shall tell you now, that\r\nyou may not be rebellious for lack of understanding."\r\n\r\nHe pointed again, this time at the moon with its restless blue halo.\r\n\r\n"It was not always so," he said. His voice softened as his memory\r\ndrifted back across the ages. 

"Once it was yellow, pitted and airless\r\nand dead, shining only with light reflected from the sun. Men changed\r\nthat, as they changed the face of their world, by the power of their\r\nscience, which in the end defeated the aims they strove for and\r\ndestroyed them almost utterly. The handful that remained of them found\r\nhaven in the Valley and began a new civilization, which is today the\r\nPeople. This time, being wiser, they outlawed the practice of science."\r\n\r\nUnder Kaliz\' calm assurance Ortho\'s resentment dwindled, and his\r\nloathing of the high-priest gave way to bewilderment.\r\n\r\n"Science?" he repeated. 

"It is another strange word. 

I do not\r\nunderstand."\r\n\r\n"In another age Gor Zan would have been a scientist," Kaliz said. "I\r\nhave seen them with my own eyes in the ancient days, puttering in\r\ntomblike shops that shut other men away from them, denying all pleasure\r\nwhile they spent their lives improving what other scientists had\r\nalready discovered. They were never satisfied, and in the end it was\r\ntheir insatiable lust for perfection that killed them, that set the\r\nvery moon aflame and flung mankind back into the savagery from which it\r\nhad risen.\r\n\r\n"For there was a time," he went on sombrely, shifting his sitting-stone\r\nto follow Ortho\'s troubled gaze down into the blue depths of the\r\nValley, "long before my own, when men lived as simply as we, but\r\nwithout our peace and security. The world then was a savage place,\r\nfull of frightful beasts which killed men for food because they were\r\nno more than weaker animals. Men, being weak and soft, sought communal\r\nsafety in numbers and gained an advantage over the beasts because they\r\ndeveloped intelligence and logic by exchanging ideas and experiences.\r\n\r\n"They learned to use this intelligence to develop weapons which\r\neventually wiped out the dangerous beasts and made the world safe;\r\nbut they were not content with safety, and fought savagely among\r\nthemselves. Nations numbering millions of men came into being and\r\nwarred with each other, and with each war their ingenuity grew and the\r\ndeadliness of their weapons kept pace with their ingenuity."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKaliz was quiet for a moment, listening to the faint laughter of the\r\nPeople that drifted up faintly from the Valley floor.\r\n\r\n"Men were not happy then as they are now," he said. "I remember them,\r\nOrtho, because I was one of them, and by a miracle escaped the great\r\nholocaust that destroyed mankind. Men had developed a weapon whose\r\ndestructiveness was beyond the power of the mind to conceive, and it\r\nescaped control; nation after nation died in a breath, whole continents\r\nvanished under the impact of robot missiles whose explosions destroyed\r\nmatter itself. One of these, perhaps by intent, struck the moon, and\r\nits reaction under the moon\'s lighter gravity set up a conflagration\r\nwhich never went out.\r\n\r\n"Those of us who survived the holocaust were greatly changed by the\r\nradiations of the explosions, and most of us soon died. I alone, by\r\nchance, was rendered deathless. More ages have passed than I can\r\nnumber, but I live on, perhaps eternally, to see that the People do not\r\nerr and fall again into the trap which science with its Machines would\r\nplace in their way.\r\n\r\n"Gor Zan was a throwback to my own savage day, a natural scientist who\r\nbelieved nothing he was told and reasoned with a deadly logic that\r\nnothing created by nature can be perfect, but must be improved by the\r\nthought and effort of man. Today we slew him, reluctantly, because he\r\nhad taken the final irrevocable step that branded him a heretic and an\r\noutlaw.\r\n\r\n"Gor Zan made a Machine."\r\n\r\nHe stretched out a hand to Ortho and they rose together, the abashed\r\neyes of the neophyte not meeting those of the high-priest.\r\n\r\n"Come," Kaliz said, "and behold the thing with your own eyes. I have\r\nkept it intact to convince you beyond doubt of Gor Zan\'s heresy."\r\n\r\nThey went back into the priest-cave, past the long tiers of Books,\r\ncrumbling and yellow with age, to stand in awed silence over the thing\r\nGor Zan had made. Ortho stared, shivering, feeling the cold aura of\r\nunsentient, alien power that radiated from the Machine.\r\n\r\nIt was a crude affair, built upon two wooden shafts that slanted upward\r\nto end in a pair of rough handles. Across them were lashed shorter\r\nsticks that supported a woven basket. At the forward end was a thin\r\ndisc made of wooden segments, a little wooden axle running through the\r\ncenter and holding the disc upright between the joined ends of the\r\nshafts.\r\n\r\n"Gor Zan tired of making two trips to his cave with firewood and\r\nfruit," old Kaliz said sombrely, "so he created a Machine which would\r\ncarry a greater load than his shoulders would bear. In my own age the\r\nthing was called a Wheelbarrow, but the name of it is not important now\r\nbecause there will never be another.\r\n\r\n"We will destroy it now, and with its destruction we will forget what\r\nGor Zan had rediscovered, which is the first principle of the Machine\r\nthat enslaved and then destroyed mankind--the Wheel."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE WHEEL IS DEATH ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!)

In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
