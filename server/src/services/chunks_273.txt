FRITCH\r\n\r\n                         ILLUSTRATED BY ORBAN\r\n\r\n            Sober or drunk, Johnny was seeing things. Like\r\n           spider webs in the night sky. 

But as a newspaper\r\n           reporter, Bennet had the job of keeping facts and\r\n           fancies separate. He was good at that--too good!\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n          Science Fiction Adventures Magazine, February 1953.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nI found Johnny a few blocks from our hotel in a little bar that was\r\nnearly deserted. He was sitting alone at a table in a dark corner,\r\nstaring morosely at nothing in particular, his hand limp around an\r\nalmost-empty glass. He seemed perfectly sober, though his eyes stared\r\nglassily ahead.\r\n\r\nI sat down beside him. "What do you say we go back to the hotel,\r\nJohnny? Tomorrow\'s another slave day."\r\n\r\nHis eyes shifted to me and then back to nothing. I wondered if he had\r\nactually seen me.\r\n\r\n"We can talk about it over some coffee and a bit to eat."\r\n\r\nI suggested, placing my hand on his arm.\r\n\r\n"Go to hell," he said quietly and shook me loose. He lifted his glass,\r\ndrained the last few drops. He held the empty glass to the light, then\r\nset it down, regretfully. "But first buy me a drink."\r\n\r\n"You\'d better go home," I said. "You\'ve had enough."\r\n\r\nHe laughed harshly. "Look who\'s giving me orders. I know things about\r\nthis cock-eyed old world you never had nightmares about, and you\'re\r\nordering me around! Bossy newspapermen! Go to hell, then; I\'ll get my\r\nown drink."\r\n\r\nHe rose unsteadily and managed his way to the bar. He came back with\r\nthe glass full.\r\n\r\n"You still here. I thought I told you--"\r\n\r\n"You\'d better lay off that stuff," I said quietly. "You\'re not used to\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Boy, oh boy, you\'re just full of orders today, aren\'t you? Charlie\r\nBennet, boy crusader! Well, I\'ve got something you can crusade about.\r\nAnything else you\'d like?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s enough for now."\r\n\r\n"You\'re damn right it is. Now get the hell out of here and leave me\r\nalone. Can\'t you see I\'m brooding over the fate of the world?"\r\n\r\n"What are you so mad about?"\r\n\r\nHe looked annoyed, and a little startled. "Brother, if you only knew--"\r\nHe raised his glass, and then stopped and set it on the table. "Wait a\r\nminute. 

Maybe I ought to tell you. Maybe I ought to let the two of us\r\nworry about it, instead of just me. Maybe you should print it in that\r\nnewspaper of yours."\r\n\r\n"I\'m willing to listen, anyway."\r\n\r\n"Sure! Why not? I\'m just beginning to experience that rosy sensation,\r\nthat warm feeling of camaraderie they keep stoppered up in bottles.\r\nIt\'s the only place on this planet you can find it."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be cynical."\r\n\r\n"Maybe I should bust out laughing. The whole thing\'s really funny; it\'s\r\nthe funniest thing I\'ve ever heard."\r\n\r\n"We\'d better go."\r\n\r\n"Sure, let\'s go. But first--you want to see something really funny?\r\nHere."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe took a pair of glasses from his pocket and handed them to me. They\r\nseemed like ordinary shell-rimmed glasses, though the lenses were\r\ntinted a slight blue.\r\n\r\n"Put them on," he prompted. "Go ahead."\r\n\r\n"Where\'d you get these?"\r\n\r\n"Made \'em," he said. "My job is optical research, remember. I was\r\nfooling around in the lab with some invisible light experiments. The\r\nright combination of lenses and coatings--and whammo! This." 

He took\r\na drink. "I should have been a lawyer or a plumber or something." He\r\ngrunted. 

"Or even a newspaperman!"\r\n\r\n"What are they supposed to do--see in the dark?"\r\n\r\nHe laughed humorlessly. "That\'d be a boon for a reporter, wouldn\'t it?\r\nNo, my friend, much worse than that. Try them on. 

Go ahead."\r\n\r\nI did. "Well?

"\r\n\r\n"Notice anything peculiar?"\r\n\r\n"The coating makes everything here seem bluish--maybe even unearthly,\r\nif that\'s what you want--but--"\r\n\r\n"C\'mon outside, then," he said. This time he took my arm and steered me\r\nfrom the bar. I was glad of the opportunity to get him into the night\r\nair.\r\n\r\n"Look at the sky," he directed. "See anything unusual?" He stood\r\nwaiting, expectant.\r\n\r\n"I see stars," I said. "Nothing unusual about that, is there?"\r\n\r\n"Stars! Only stars?" His voice had lost its tinge of sarcasm. His\r\nfingers were tight on my arm. "Look, across the sky, see those luminous\r\nbands? All across the sky. Like a giant spider web."\r\n\r\nI looked again. After awhile, I said, "Sorry, Johnny, but there aren\'t\r\nany luminous bands, spider webs or otherwise. I think we\'d better get\r\nto the room. A good night\'s rest--"\r\n\r\n"Wait a minute," he cried suddenly, his face pale. "You think I\'m\r\ndrunk--or worse. I tell you there _is_ something up there. Shining\r\nstreamers crisscrossing the sky, like--like--"\r\n\r\n"There\'s nothing, Johnny. Only stars."\r\n\r\nI took the glasses off. He made a quick grab for them and somehow they\r\nfell to the pavement and shattered.\r\n\r\nFor a moment, Johnny stared at the glittering fragments, his jaws\r\nworking. "You\'ve broken them," he accused finally, his eyes filled more\r\nwith sudden despair than hatred. "It took weeks to build them."\r\n\r\n"It was an accident," I told him. "But it\'s just as well they are\r\nbroken. I tell you, Johnny, there\'s nothing unusual in the sky. Nothing\r\nat all. Spider webs! Next you\'ll be seeing pink elephants."\r\n\r\nJohnny stood in the cool night and stared at the sky. "They\'re up\r\nthere, I tell you. They\'re up there, and I want to know why. And\r\nthere\'s one thing I want to know more than anything else; suppose\r\nthey\'re really spider webs--" His face was deathly white. "Are there\r\nspiders?"\r\n\r\nHe stared at me insanely in the darkness. "Do you realize what that\r\nwould mean, Charlie? Giant spiders, invisible, roaming across the\r\nEarth!" His fingers were digging into my arm again.\r\n\r\n"Johnny, come out of it," I snapped, shaking him. "There is no web in\r\nthe sky, you hear me? And there aren\'t any spiders, either. It\'s just\r\nsome crazy figment of your imagination. 

That\'s all."\r\n\r\n"But just suppose there are," he persisted, a little wildly.\r\n"Maybe--maybe it\'s not just the glasses. Maybe it\'s partly me, too;\r\nmaybe I\'m the only one who can see them; maybe that\'s why you didn\'t\r\nsee the web. Maybe--"\r\n\r\n"Johnny, be sensible! If there were such monsters roaming around, don\'t\r\nyou think they\'d have been discovered by now?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," he said, helplessly. "I don\'t know, and it\'s driving\r\nme crazy. You\'ve probably wondered why I haven\'t slept very well for\r\nthe past couple of weeks; well, that\'s the reason. I didn\'t want to say\r\nanything. I hardly dared put the glasses on, I was so afraid. Not of\r\nbeing thought crazy, but--but afraid of what _they_ might do if they\r\nknew they were discovered."\r\n\r\n"Look, Johnny. Even supposing you might be right, why wouldn\'t they\r\nshow themselves? Why just stay up in the sky in a large web?"\r\n\r\n"Maybe they\'re sizing us up," Johnny said, trembling but not with cold.\r\n"After all, we\'ve got a few weapons, too. Maybe a machine gun or an\r\natomic bomb can hurt them, as well as humans."\r\n\r\n"Unless they\'re here for some good?" I suggested.\r\n\r\nJohnny laughed. "Spiders? Maybe they\'re hungry--and they think we\'re a\r\nbunch of flies down here. That\'s more likely.

"\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t this--rather fantastic?"\r\n\r\n"Of course it is. Why do you suppose I\'ve been keeping quiet about\r\nit for the past two weeks? Why do you suppose I\'m out trying to get\r\ndrunk?" He added disgustedly: "I can\'t even do that."\r\n\r\n"C\'mon," I said, "let\'s go to the room and we\'ll have some coffee. We\r\ncan talk about it there."\r\n\r\n"Sure," he said, and his voice was suddenly subdued. 

"Sure, why not?"\r\n\r\nWe went to the hotel room and I made some coffee, being careful to\r\nslip enough sleeping tablets in Johnny\'s cup. In a few minutes he was\r\nsprawled across the bed.\r\n\r\nI went to the window and looked at the glowing beads of traffic below.\r\nI looked at the sky--at the stars. Spiders in the sky; what a story\r\nthat would make. The editor\'d slap me in the booby hatch if I ever\r\nhanded in a who-what-when-where like that.\r\n\r\nWhen I left for work the next morning, Johnny was still snoozing. Let\r\nhim sleep it off. Do him good. He\'d been working too hard at the lab,\r\nanyhow.\r\n\r\nI couldn\'t get back to the hotel room that morning, though I wanted to\r\nsee if Johnny was okay. I was pretty busy writing a human interest yarn\r\nkidding the pants off some astronomer\'s notion that light waves coming\r\nfrom certain portions of the sky were being deflected or refracted\r\nslightly for no discernible reason.\r\n\r\nThe amount of difference was microscopic, and I wrote it up to\r\nemphasize its ridiculous splitting of hairs and the fact that you can\'t\r\ntake some of these crackpots seriously. Here the world is on the verge\r\nof coming apart at the seams, and they worry about wayward light rays.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon, I managed to drop into the hotel to see if Johnny\r\nhad slept off the liquor and the sleeping tablets. He had, and he was\r\nsitting on the edge of the bed, looking grim--and a little perplexed.\r\n\r\n"How ya feeling, Johnny?" I said.\r\n\r\n"Great," he said, though he didn\'t sound it. "Things seem a lot clearer\r\nthis morning."\r\n\r\n"Good. I thought they would. You know, you really had me going last\r\nnight. I thought you meant all that stuff, but I guess imagination and\r\na few beers can do a lot."\r\n\r\n"Cut the kidding," he said grimly.\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"I said, cut it. I\'m not in the mood."\r\n\r\n"Now what\'s the matter?

"\r\n\r\n"This," he said. He held up a pair of glasses, twins to those destroyed.\r\n\r\n"But--how could you have made another set? You haven\'t been near the\r\nlab today."\r\n\r\n"When I first discovered this web business, I made two pair of glasses.\r\nI figured two people could do something about it a whole lot easier\r\nthan just one. But I was afraid to let anyone in on it. I thought maybe\r\nI _was_ batty."\r\n\r\n"So?"\r\n\r\n"I made this pair for you. For you, Charlie, so you could write the\r\nstuff up in your paper to let people know. That\'s a laugh, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Say--that\'s swell. 

But--"\r\n\r\n"Stand back!" Johnny cried suddenly, as I started to move toward him.\r\nHe snatched a gun from beneath a pillow and waved it threateningly.\r\n"Know what I was doing this afternoon before you came in?"\r\n\r\n"Johnny, this is crazy! Put down that gun and listen to reason."\r\n\r\n"I had the glasses on," he continued, "and I was looking out the window\r\nhere. I\'m getting real brave--even in broad daylight--but there comes\r\na time when you just don\'t care. I saw _spiders_ in the streets. Huge\r\nspiders walking along the streets, mingling with human beings. And\r\nget this, Charlie--when I took the glasses off, they were like human\r\nbeings. Like humans, you understand. 

You know what that means? They\'re\r\nin disguise all around us!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s not true, Johnny," I insisted. "There are no webs in the sky.\r\nThere are _no_ spiders. It\'s your imagination. 

The strain. Working in\r\nthe lab--"\r\n\r\n"No," he cried, and the gun never wavered. "You know what else I saw? 

A\r\nfew minutes ago. I was looking down into the street, and a spider got\r\nout of a car just in front of the hotel here and started coming in. I\r\ntook off the glasses to see if it might be someone I knew.

"\r\n\r\nHe began to laugh hysterically. "You know who it was, Charlie--"\r\n\r\nI leaped forward, trying to knock the gun down. But Johnny\'s hand came\r\nup, and the gun jumped, spurting noise and flame. The bullet slammed\r\ninto my body.\r\n\r\nDesperately, I drove forward. My arms went around him. The gun went\r\noff again, before I could prevent it. A furrow of pain shot across my\r\nstomach, and I shrieked out in sudden anguish.\r\n\r\n"Johnny, Johnny. Stop it. Stop!"\r\n\r\nI struck his hand. The gun clattered to the floor. He was struggling\r\nfrantically, striking out against me with doubled fists. His shirt was\r\nsplattered with my blood. He gasped, clearing his lungs for a scream.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing else I could do. The life was draining from me.\r\n\r\nI held his arms and legs together and tried not to look into the\r\nterrified expression crossing his face. I held him tightly while he\r\nsquirmed in helpless frustration.\r\n\r\nAnd with my two remaining arms I strangled him!\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK COME INTO MY PARLOR ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\xe2\x80\x99s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
