]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n           Astronauts and cosmonauts! When you finally reach\r\n           Mars, please be very careful what you look like!\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the shadows of a crater-wall on Phobos, moon of Mars, Grg and Yrl\r\nwaited to greet the God.\r\n\r\nIf the God continued its present rate of approach, it would land within\r\nmoments.\r\n\r\nGrg and Yrl had journeyed all night, with their eyes on that distant\r\nglinting speck in the sky. Over cold-crusted sand dunes and jagged\r\ncrater walls they had flowed, crept, bounded, oozed, toward the spot\r\nwhere the God must land if its course held true.\r\n\r\nGrg was a Fsgh, which is the equivalent of High Priest, Yrl was a\r\nFfssgghh, or Much Higher Priest. The best wishes of their people had\r\ngone with them on their tremendous mission.\r\n\r\nNow, at the place, they trembled in every tentacle as they peered\r\nupward. The rust-red orb of Mars rode the black horizon.\r\n\r\nMars was, as Grg and Yrl had learned from their Elders and now taught\r\ntheir Youngers, the stern Seeing-All Eye of It Who Was the Universe.\r\n\r\nFrom that great Eye, a day ago, had sprung a shining Messenger, an\r\nEmissary, a God that must be coming on a purposeful visit.\r\n\r\nIt had been detected at the half-way point of its trip. But there\r\ncould be no doubt regarding its origin, its nature, its destination--\r\n\r\nFor, in the matter of form, the God was a close replica of Grg and\r\nYrl--of all the creatures of their race! It was octopidal, with sinewy\r\ndouble tentacles, and a thinking trunk, and a reproduction pouch!\r\n\r\nThe only significant difference was that the God gleamed mysteriously,\r\nas if its angular, hard-line representation of normal form were cast in\r\nshining stone. As it flew it reflected starlight--and the red glow of\r\nthe Universal Eye behind it--from its sleek surfaces.\r\n\r\nGrg and Yrl blinked their own dull-surfaced, astronomically\r\nfar-sighted, rust-red eyes at each other in supreme excitement and\r\nanticipation.\r\n\r\nWhat would the God tell them? What would it reveal? 

Would it divulge\r\nthe Cosmic Secret? Would it tell them the place and destiny of their\r\nlowly race? Had it come to punish them for not being good enough, for\r\nover-reproducing, for worshipping improperly?\r\n\r\nFrom a selfish standpoint, it might even tell them how to get rid of\r\nthe _plllnk_--a subject of constant prayer.\r\n\r\nHow smoothly it flew! While Grg and Yrl and their people could bound\r\nabout with a great agility in Phobos\' light gravity, they could not\r\n_fly_.\r\n\r\n"How wonderful it would be to fly," said Yrl.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps," said Grg, "we have been found ready to be taught!"\r\n\r\nThen Grg twitched as a _plllnk_ bit him, just under the front left\r\ndouble-tentacle. He combed the light fur there, found the _plllnk_,\r\nand shredded it, casting the pieces round-about so that no two of them\r\nmight combine to form another _plllnk_.\r\n\r\nHow wonderful it would be also if the God could tell them how to get\r\nrid of the itching, crawling, parasitic _plllnk_, whose bite, in\r\nsufficient numbers, was often fatal!...\r\n\r\nThe God began to land.\r\n\r\nIt shot red flame downward from its mouth, on the underside of its\r\ngleaming body. Red flickers and sharp-edged black shadows danced about\r\nthe two who waited below. 

They shrank back, fearful that the display\r\nmight be a disapproving communication--yet they held their ground,\r\nknowing they had lived good lives and deserved no condemnation on any\r\nscore they could imagine.\r\n\r\nThe God lowered, on its belching tongue of flame--the flame that seemed\r\na tiny part, a sliver, of the Universal Eye that Watched.\r\n\r\nStrange marks were on the side of the God\'s body. They were: 1st MARS\r\nEXPEDITION--U. S. SPACE FORCE--PLANET-TO-SATELLITE CREWBOAT NO. 2.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe last few moments of the God\'s descent were quite rapid.\r\nSimultaneously, the darting red flames seemed to lessen in intensity\r\nand length. Then, at the second of impact, they brightened again to\r\nprevious power--but too late. The impact was hard.\r\n\r\nGrg and Yrl gasped as one of the God\'s double-tentacles buckled,\r\ncrumpled, with a glinting of shiny-hard material. The flames stopped.\r\n\r\nThe God, unable to remain erect with its injury, slowly toppled. Its\r\nbody thudded silently, stirring pumice dust. It was motionless.\r\n\r\nGrg and Yrl stared at each other.\r\n\r\nWas the God fatally injured? Dying? 

Dead? (For a broken tentacle meant\r\nthat fluids would seep out, and soon the dry-death would occur.)\r\n\r\nThe God stirred.\r\n\r\nIt braced two sets of tentacles against the ground, as if trying\r\nto push itself erect. The effort was not successful. Again it\r\nwas motionless. The two double-tentacles remained outstretched,\r\nhowever--and they pointed at the shadows where Grg and Yrl waited and\r\nwatched.\r\n\r\nGrg and Yrl sighed in relief.\r\n\r\nThe God had assumed conversation-position.\r\n\r\nIt must have healed its broken tentacle--truly a God! Soon it would be\r\nas good as new; for otherwise, agony would forbid conversation.\r\n\r\nIt was ready to address them. Now.\r\n\r\nThis was the greatest moment of Grg\'s and Yrl\'s lives.\r\n\r\nThey waited for the God to speak.\r\n\r\nIt was silent.\r\n\r\nA long time passed. The God remained motionless, though in\r\nconversation-position, and silent. A _very_ long time passed.\r\n\r\nThen a tiny hole appeared in the God\'s side. 

It grew\r\nlarger--larger--and then it stopped growing larger.\r\n\r\nSomething appeared at the hole. It paused, then dropped to the surface\r\nof Phobos, where it began to crawl about.\r\n\r\nIt bore considerable resemblance to a _plllnk_, except for its\r\nshiny-wrinkled grey skin (_plllnks_ were purple.) And this thing was\r\nhuge--_Huge_. It was one-fifth the size of the God\'s body.\r\n\r\nCaught by horror, and fearing the worst, Grg and Yrl waited for the God\r\nto speak.\r\n\r\n(_Damn_, John Cotter was thinking. _That was a neat bit of sloppiness,\r\nthat landing.... Carruthers will chew me out and in again!_ Pause:\r\n_Holy cats, I hope the radio isn\'t busted, or I\'ll have a helluva wait\r\nbefore they follow up and find me!..._)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe God was dead.\r\n\r\nKilled by the giant _plllnk_--a scourge from which, evidently, even\r\nthe Gods were not spared. The huge _plllnk_, even now creeping\r\naround--wrinkle-skinned and detestable, its coloration the same as the\r\nGod\'s; the most loathsome sight imaginable ... a god-_plllnk_!\r\n\r\nGrg and Yrl moved into view, from the shadows of the crater wall.\r\nTheir thinking trunks tingled with misery, sorrow, bitter anger and\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\nThe _plllnk_ stopped, having sensed them. Then it darted for the hole\r\nit had eaten in the God.\r\n\r\nYrl moved to intercept it. The _plllnk_ changed course and headed\r\nswiftly up a sand dune. With a great bound, impelled by outrage, Yrl\r\nwas upon it.\r\n\r\nWhile Grg touched tentacles with the dead God, in reverent mourning,\r\nin terrible sorrow, in loss, in supplication, Yrl shredded the\r\ngod-_plllnk_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwo days later, a second God was detected. It silently circled Phobos\r\nfrom the Universal Eye.\r\n\r\nIt did not land. It silently circled Phobos, and then returned to the\r\nEye.\r\n\r\nWithin the day, it was back, in the company of eleven other Gods. They\r\nlanded. Joyfully, mortals went forth to meet them.\r\n\r\nIt was quite a battle while it lasted.\r\n\r\nJoy quickly ended, as the Gods died one by one, each of them showing\r\nthe holes eaten in their sides by the insatiable _plllnks_.\r\n\r\nLikewise, eventually, died all the _plllnks_, which presumably had\r\nkilled the Gods. They fought with strange white flares and crackling\r\nblue flashes, which only tickled the hides of the faithful. Then they\r\nwere shredded.\r\n\r\nReligious beliefs on Phobos underwent certain basic changes. Such as:\r\nthe Gods, or at least their Messengers, were known not to be immortal.\r\n\r\nNor were the special variety of _plllnk_ which afflicted them....\r\n\r\nOn Earth, twenty years afterward, word is anxiously awaited of the 4th\r\nMars Expedition.\r\n\r\nEND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE GOD-PLLLNK ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!)

It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
