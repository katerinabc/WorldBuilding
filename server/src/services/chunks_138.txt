Illusionations, we call \'em.\r\n             Funny though, Willie disappeared that night!"\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Imagination Stories of Science and Fantasy\r\n                             October 1952\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nJust where Willie went, I ain\'t sure. I wonder sometimes, especially\r\naround harvest because that is about the time we found Willie was\r\nmissing. I should pine after him a little. He was my son, but somehow I\r\nnever took a hankering toward Willie like I ought to. I got five other\r\nboys a lot smarter, bigger, and nicer to look at than Willie ever was,\r\nbesides four girls that\'s as pretty as they come. But when someone\r\ndisappears, like Willie did, even if you don\'t care particularly much\r\nyou kind of wonder at times just how it came about.\r\n\r\nWillie was near about fourteen or thereabouts. I never could remember\r\nfor sure. He wasn\'t the oldest and he wasn\'t the youngest. But then\r\nwith ten kids and ten ages to keep track of a man can\'t be expected to\r\nremember. Anyhow he\'d be about sixteen now, since it was two years ago\r\nthat it happened.\r\n\r\nIt was a bad time for him to be skipping off, too. We were in the\r\nmiddle of harvest. 

We had corn to get in, besides which we had a bit of\r\na scare around here with lights flashing in the hills and funny noises\r\nat night. The fellows who know call that sort of thing by some fancy\r\nname. "Mass illusionations," I guess they\'d say.\r\n\r\nWell, one night we sat down to chow. We\'d worked hard all day, so we\r\nwere filling ourselves as full as we could. Ma is a right good cook\r\nwhen she bothers, and the girls do all right by themselves. When we\r\nfinished, Joey pops up. 

I think it was Joey. I can\'t rightly remember.\r\nWhen you got ten kids and ten names to keep track of you\'re bound to\r\nhave a hard time remembering.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, one of the kids pops up and says, "Look, Pa! Willie\'s plate is\r\nall full up with chow and no Willie."\r\n\r\nMa looks down the row and tallies them up. Sure thing, nine kids and no\r\nWillie. I kind of wondered why Willie wasn\'t around. He\'s usually the\r\nfirst to eat and the last to stop. 

Ma looked worried.\r\n\r\n"Well," I says. "Pass his plate. Don\'t want any food to go to waste."\r\nSo, the plate is passed down to me. By the time it goes down the line\r\nof kids there\'s one porkchop left. I eat the porkchop and forget about\r\nWillie for a while.\r\n\r\nNext morning, Joey comes up and says Willie wasn\'t home last night.\r\n\r\n"So," I says. "Willie wasn\'t home last night. Where\'s breakfast?" Ma\r\nlooks worried. Like I say Ma always liked Willie.\r\n\r\n"OK, Ma," I pipes up. "We\'ll ask the neighbors. It\'d be easy to spot\r\nWillie anywhere." 

That\'s what I figured. Even though I hate to say it\r\nabout my own son, Willie was plumb peculiar to look at. He had a head\r\nthat looked like it belonged on a man a hundred pounds heavier. It sat\r\nlike a knob on the end of a scrawny, skinny body. A body too scrawny to\r\nbe much use in farming.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe sure was dumb too, that Willie. If you put him out to plow a\r\nstraight line, he\'d plow a circle. If you wanted him to plow a curve,\r\nhe\'d plow a zig-zag line. He wasn\'t like the other boys. Willie got\r\nkicked out of school when he was eight. Not that the other boys\r\nfinished school, but he got kicked out real disgraceful-like. Now\r\nBennie, he set fire to the teacher\'s chair; Joey burned down the whole\r\nschool building. But Willie, guldurn Willie, he read all the books he\r\ncould get ahold of till he knew more than the teacher: so of course,\r\nthe teacher had to kick him out to save her face. Take Willie to pull\r\na trick like that. Asked her such fool questions that she had to close\r\nthe school for a couple months to take a rest cure. That was Willie for\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nSometimes I wonder myself why Willie don\'t mean as much to me as some\r\nof the other kids do. Maybe it\'s because I wasn\'t around when Willie\r\nwas born. Just happened the draft, the war draft that is, called my\r\nnumber. That was for the second world war. 

Well anyhow they didn\'t want\r\nme. 

I guess the government didn\'t want to support my kids. Don\'t blame\r\nthem though.\r\n\r\nI go to the city and two weeks later I come back and there is Willie.\r\nHe\'s just an ordinary baby, no hair and no teeth.\r\n\r\n"Kinda homely," I says to Ma. But she doesn\'t seem to care, so I figure\r\nI don\'t care either.\r\n\r\nWillie grew up and Willie kept getting in the way. Asked all kinds of\r\nsilly questions. Sure, the others always wanted to know why the grass\r\nis green; but not Willie. Willie asks some silly question about "the\r\nrelative merits of transistor amplifiers as compared to vacuum tubes."\r\nThat ain\'t all the questions he asked. 

But you get the idea. Willie\r\nalways acted kind of big for his breeches.\r\n\r\nMa always seemed to encourage him too. Keeps saying Willie ain\'t my\r\nson. I know she\'s kidding, of course. I reckon she means sort of\r\nlike, in spirit he ain\'t my son. In that respect, I agree with her.\r\nWillie sure ain\'t my son. Some of the kids titter when Ma says that.\r\nEspecially Ellie, or was it Sue? We had another one of those "mess of\r\nillusionations" about that time. Sue kept talking about funny looking\r\nmen, with funny looking heads, wearing funny looking clothes. She said\r\nthey jumped out of a coffee saucer or something like that. Just a baby,\r\nyou know, with crazy notions. I never do pay any attention to these\r\ncrazy ideas the kids bring up. I once read a book or something, or\r\nmaybe someone told me, kids always see things that aren\'t there. Just\r\nhumor them and don\'t say nothing, so I don\'t say nothing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe had a couple more kids after Willie. Three I think it was. All nice\r\nstrong babies. I remember once Willie asked where they came from. That\r\nwas the only near normal question Willie ever asked. He found out quick\r\nenough without any help from me. Willie was like that. He found out all\r\nkinds of goofy things from Lord only knows where. Even kept telling me\r\nthat it didn\'t matter at all what time of moon I planted the crops.\r\nJust a punk kid too big for his breeches. Been farming all my life and\r\nhe\'s telling me.\r\n\r\nTo get back to the facts, we asked the folks around here if any of them\r\nhad noticed the whereabouts of Willie. Someone said they\'d seen him\r\nin the cornfield near the Weston farm. At least, what used to be the\r\nWeston farm. The same night Willie disappeared someone or something\r\nrooted and burned his whole corn patch.\r\n\r\nOn the whole most people were too interested in the lights and noises\r\nthey were seeing and hearing to pay any attention to Willie\'s getting\r\nlost. Ma missed Willie at first. He used to keep her company quite a\r\nbit. He was too scrawny to do outside work, so he used to help Ma in\r\nthe house. But soon even Ma got used to the idea. Now she don\'t mention\r\nhim no more.\r\n\r\nDon\'t know why I\'m telling you this. Maybe it\'s because you\'re new\r\naround here and I thought you might be interested.\r\n\r\nHey Ma! 

How about a fresh pot of coffee? This one\'s about gone.\r\n\r\nAbout Willie now, it might be the time of year that makes me think\r\nabout him. It\'s harvest time you know. The time Willie disappeared.\r\nHey Ma, tell those kids to cut the noise out there. Can\'t hear myself\r\nthink. Now where were we? Come to think of it, the kids are all in bed\r\nby now. Hard day harvesting.\r\n\r\nMaybe I\'d better check on the noise. Want to come along? 

Watch your\r\nhead as you go out. The stoop is kind of low. I always bang my head if\r\nI don\'t stop to think about it.\r\n\r\nHey you! What you doing in my corn? Guldurn flying saucer or no guldurn\r\nflying saucer, that guldurn thing is ruining my crop! Hey, there\'s\r\nsome people or what look like people. 

Say, they remind me of Willie,\r\nbig heads and scrawny bodies. Well, what do you know? It\'s Willie!\r\nWillie, where you been and where\'d you get that get up? Tell those\r\nthings you\'re with to get the saucer thing off my corn. Just wait till\r\nyour Ma sees you. She\'s been worried sick. 

Fine thing! Leaving us in\r\nthe middle of harvest. Hey Ma! It\'s Willie!\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK "HEY MA, WHERE\'S WILLIE?" ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
