CHAPMAN\r\n\r\n                    _The adventure of a man who sat\r\n                    alone in space for six years!_\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n                          Comet December 40.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFerris was in the tiny cupola, admiring the immense sphere of Earth\r\nabove him, when the bell sounded. Galsworth again, no doubt. It had\r\nbeen Galsworth every time for twenty-four hours. What did he want now?\r\n\r\nFerris went below, preparing himself for the same ugly face, the usual\r\ngrating voice. He sat before the screens and snapped a switch. The\r\nscreen colored, took form. He was right.\r\n\r\nGalsworth said: "Fuel Station 12?" As if he didn\'t know. When Ferris\r\nnodded, the company head announced: "Replacement will be in effect\r\nwithin ten hours. You\'ll prepare for the trip."\r\n\r\n"Replacement!" Ferris gasped. "For what reason--"\r\n\r\n"You\'ll have the details when you reach Earth, Ferris. Be ready when\r\nBrooks arrives. He\'ll be there shortly."\r\n\r\n"Brooks! Who\'s he? The kid?"\r\n\r\n"You\'re asking too many questions, Ferris. Brooks is young, yes, but\r\nhe\'ll fill the position. We\'ll explain later. 

That\'s all."\r\n\r\nIt took a few minutes for Ferris to recover. Replacement! After six\r\nyears of service at the number one fuel station between the Earth\r\nand Moon. Why, he was the only man who could handle Station 12! And\r\nGalsworth was sending Brooks, a green kid barely out of SM school. What\r\nwas the guy thinking of?\r\n\r\nAngered, Ferris got up from his stool and paced the floor. It was easy\r\nto picture Galsworth sitting at his desk. He\'d be chewing a big cigar,\r\npounding a pudgy fist into his palm, telling young Brooks that Station\r\n12 needed a stalwart lad willing to face numerous cosmic dangers in\r\norder that commerce between the Earth and Moon would not fall below its\r\npresent status. Only Galsworth would say it like that.\r\n\r\nWell, what was wrong with the present status? Ferris had kept the\r\ncompany heads above water; he hadn\'t fallen down on the job. But they\r\napparently weren\'t satisfied. Something was wrong, and it seemed that\r\nGalsworth was taking it out on Ferris.\r\n\r\nStill perplexed, Ferris entered his living quarters and began packing.\r\nHe dismissed Galsworth from his mind, wondered whether or not Brooks\r\ncould meet the task of operating the station. It was a lonely job,\r\nsitting there in the cylindrical island of space, watching ships\r\napproach and pass in the cold void that housed him. Brooks would grow\r\nweary of it, just as Ferris had at first. There wasn\'t a more dismal\r\nexistence in the solar system, but to Ferris it was home, and even the\r\nthought of that was comforting.\r\n\r\nThe sound of a hissing airlock brought Ferris to his senses. Brooks was\r\nahead of schedule--\r\n\r\nFerris went back to the control room. A tall fellow stood there, his\r\nhair drooping, his space tunic ripped open at the collar. His face was\r\nstone-like.\r\n\r\n"You aren\'t Brooks," said Ferris. "What do you want?"\r\n\r\n"Fuel," the other dropped a hand to a belt holster. "I need fuel for\r\nmy ship--a lot of it. And you\'re the only fellow in my path who\'s got\r\nit. 

Let\'s not waste time.

"\r\n\r\n"You\'ve come to the wrong place," said Ferris, starting forward. "The\r\nbarrels here are under government combination seal, and can\'t be opened\r\nby anyone other than the inspectors who accompany our regular ships."\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless," the tall fellow drew his beam gun, "you have fuel in\r\nyour repulsion tanks, and that\'s as good as any."\r\n\r\nFor a moment Ferris stood there, undetermined. 

Then he remembered a\r\npolice bulletin not so long ago. A convict had escaped from one of\r\nEarth\'s interplanetary prisons. He understood now.\r\n\r\n"You\'re Siegal," he said.\r\n\r\nThe other nodded. "My ship hasn\'t the fuel to carry me to the Moon. I\r\ndon\'t like to insist, but I\'m going to drain your tanks."\r\n\r\n"The station will fall," Ferris warned. "If the repulsion tanks are\r\ndrained, gravity will take hold."\r\n\r\n"Unfortunate," said Siegal, "but it\'s me or the station. I\'ve brought a\r\nhose along--also a container. I\'ll give you the pleasure of filling it\r\nfor me. 

Hurry.

"\r\n\r\nFerris had no choice, so he did as directed. Siegal had the drop on\r\nhim, and it was best to play safe. Perhaps he could talk the fellow out\r\nof his wild plan. There was a chance.\r\n\r\n"Think you\'ll make it to the Moon?" queried Ferris as he loosened a\r\nvalve and inserted the hose. "It\'s a long trek for such a small amount\r\nof fuel. Besides, you\'ll burn up half the stuff getting started.\r\nThere\'s no launch here, you know."\r\n\r\n"I left Earth without a launch," said Siegal crisply. "I can do it\r\nagain."\r\n\r\nThe syphon began a steady flow.\r\n\r\n"You won\'t make it," remarked Ferris. "And if you do get there, what\r\nthen? There\'s no place for you on the Moon. They\'ll track you down in a\r\nfew days."\r\n\r\nSiegal laughed. "You seem quite certain of all this."\r\n\r\n"Besides," went on Ferris, "I\'ll tell them all about you. They\'ll know\r\njust where you are, and they\'ll be waiting for you when you reach the\r\nMoon."\r\n\r\n"Not if I destroy your radio," said Siegal, "and not if you ride the\r\nstation back to Earth."\r\n\r\nFor a long minute there was silence. The only sound was the trickling\r\nof the liquid fuel. Ferris became uneasy.\r\n\r\n"That\'s murder," he said at length.\r\n\r\n"True," agreed Siegal. "That is murder, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\nThe container was full. At the point of Siegal\'s gun, Ferris carried\r\nthe fuel to the airlock, where he was forced to don a space tunic and\r\ntransport the container to the lone ship that was anchored outside.\r\nHe made several trips, until the station\'s tanks were nearly empty.\r\nThrough vision screens, the glow of the repulsion jets could be seen,\r\nreceding gradually.\r\n\r\n"The station will move in a matter of hours," said Ferris. "It\'s a\r\ndevilish trick, Siegal, and I hope they get you for it.

"\r\n\r\n"Never mind. 

Just fill the container again. I want to be sure the tank\r\nis empty."\r\n\r\nFerris set to work again. As he bent over the tanks, the floor gave a\r\nsudden lurch and threw him against the wall. Siegal clutched a door\r\nframe and steadied himself.\r\n\r\n"No tricks, Ferris."\r\n\r\n"But the station\'s moving. 

Can\'t you see?"\r\n\r\n"Sooner than you expected. Perhaps you can tell me why."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, Siegal. Something\'s happened."\r\n\r\n"It\'s all right, finish your work."\r\n\r\nFerris complied. Once more the precious liquid trickled into the\r\ncontainer. Minutes passed.\r\n\r\n"Brooks reporting, sir."\r\n\r\nSiegal turned, astounded. 

The red-headed youngster stood there, a\r\nlook of bewilderment on his face. Then Ferris leaped, caught Siegal\r\nabout the hips and sent him sprawling over the station floor. But the\r\nconvict was elusive. He twisted free, somewhat dazed, and stood erect.\r\nHe fired a beam at Ferris, who rolled across the floor in pain. Brooks,\r\nrealization having dawned upon him, started forward. Siegal emitted a\r\nshrill noise, grabbed the container and ran for the airlock. Brooks\r\nblocked his way, and went down as the gun struck his skull. Siegal\r\nleaped over him, vanishing a moment later beyond the airlock.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHis brain in a turmoil, Ferris got slowly to his feet and looked about.\r\nThe room was empty. No Siegal, no Brooks. The station was tilted at\r\nan angle, swaying slightly. It was falling, due to the excess weight\r\napplied when Brooks anchored his cruiser.\r\n\r\nFerris nursed his aching head. The beam had shaved his neck just below\r\nthe ear, breaking his space tunic\'s glass helmet, otherwise doing no\r\nharm.\r\n\r\nFerris made his way to the airlock. Through the heavy glass he glimpsed\r\na portion of Siegal\'s ship. Quickly, a plan formed in his mind.\r\n\r\nHe removed a metal space suit from a locker, donned it and clumped\r\nawkwardly up a stairway leading to the upper level. He crossed to a\r\nsecond airlock, advanced through, and stepped lightly onto the top of\r\nSiegal\'s ship. He dropped flat and crawled to the supply lock, through\r\nwhich a ship\'s food bundles were loaded. He grasped the latch firmly,\r\nand waited.\r\n\r\nA minute later the little cruiser moved into space. Behind, Fuel\r\nStation 12 continued its Earthward fall. Ferris watched it go, his\r\nheart heavy. All his belongings went with Station 12, all the things he\r\nhad called his home for six long years. He wondered about Brooks. The\r\nfellow\'s cruiser was drifting lifelessly to one side, no doubt having\r\nbeen cut free by Siegal. There was no evidence of Brooks\' whereabouts.\r\n\r\nFerris clung to the heavy latch as Siegal\'s cruiser slipped away in\r\nspace. Above and all around him hovered the vast outline of Earth, the\r\ncontinents and oceans showing dimly through the deep shadows. To the\r\nleft was the Moon, drifting aimlessly along the great star-curtain.\r\n\r\nFerris tugged at the latch. It moved a little. 

He tugged again and it\r\nsprang free. Ferris stood up, straddled the circular lock, and pulled\r\nback the cover. Air rushed out. Through the narrow hole he saw the tiny\r\nstorage compartment. Satisfied, he let himself through and dropped to\r\nthe floor, pulling the cover back in place as he did so.\r\n\r\nThe room was small--only a few feet higher than Ferris, not much\r\nlonger. The sound of the oxygen pumps grew louder for a moment, as the\r\nsemi-vacuum was being replaced.\r\n\r\nFerris waited several minutes, then removed the space suit. Finding the\r\nair suitable, he stepped to the compartment door, opened it a crack,\r\nand peered out.\r\n\r\nSteps led downward to a brief corridor. Beyond the corridor, a portion\r\nof the control room was visible.\r\n\r\nFerris moved out, went down the steps and proceeded cautiously along\r\nthe corridor.\r\n\r\nHe put a hand to his forehead; a sudden dizziness swept through him.\r\nHe leaned against the wall, rubbing his eyes. There was blood on his\r\nsleeve.\r\n\r\nHe couldn\'t remember how long he waited there; it may have been a\r\nnumber of minutes. He could feel his sickness overcoming him. He was\r\nweakening.\r\n\r\nA footstep sounded, and Ferris tried to open his eyes. Then he turned\r\nto go back, but a voice stopped him. It was Siegal\'s.\r\n\r\nThere was no use resisting. Siegal still had the drop on him. The\r\nconvict led him into the control cabin, forced him into a seat.\r\n\r\n"You\'re a good man, Ferris," Siegal said, "but not good enough. I might\r\nbe able to use you, though--more or less as a shield when I get to the\r\nMoon."\r\n\r\nSomewhat revived, Ferris looked up. His head still hurt him, but he was\r\nable to recollect his surroundings. He thought of Fuel Station 12--it\r\nwould be nearing Earth now. Soon it would strike, and then Galsworth\r\nwould be notified. Things would begin to happen.\r\n\r\n"Brooks reporting.

"\r\n\r\nSiegal swung, shouting angrily. But the youth was on him, knocking\r\nthe beam gun away, pinning him against the wall of the cabin. Ferris\r\nwatched dazedly, wondering where Brooks had come from. Nauseating\r\nsensations swept him again, and things went black for a moment. He\r\nheard Siegal\'s yells. A blow was struck, and Brooks tumbled back.\r\n\r\nFerris pushed himself from the stool and fell over the beam gun. As\r\nSiegal bore Brooks to the floor, Ferris rolled over, brought up his arm\r\nand pulled the trigger. His aim was bad, but the beam did its work.\r\nSiegal simply went limp.\r\n\r\nFor a long minute Ferris lay there, looking up at the youthful form of\r\nBrooks over him. He grinned.\r\n\r\n"Good work, Brooks. You make a better stowaway than I do."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"This is the first time," said Galsworth, "I\'ve ever seen bandages on\r\nyou, Ferris."\r\n\r\n"I came to talk business, Galsworth. At least, you called me here for\r\nthat reason, didn\'t you?"\r\n\r\nThe company head placed a pudgy fist against his palm. "Of course. I\r\nthought you\'d like to know why you were called in from 12."\r\n\r\n"Because you wanted to send Brooks there. Well, that\'s okay. 

He\'s a\r\ngood man--"\r\n\r\n"No, not just that. We\'ve a passenger pilot\'s license for you, if you\r\nwant it. Something we\'ve been planning for some time. You\'re the only\r\none of our station operators who has passed the exams."\r\n\r\nFerris grew red in the face. "Then, all this was just a--promotion?"\r\n\r\nGalsworth nodded. "When the new Station 12 is situated, Brooks will\r\ntake over. We\'ve better things for you. 

Willing?"\r\n\r\nTo Ferris, it was overwhelming--more so than it had been aboard\r\nSiegal\'s cruiser. He felt suddenly as if he would faint--the wound--\r\n\r\nHe did faint right there in Galsworth\'s office, but when he revived\r\nGalsworth was still smiling. It was all right--after six years!\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK IN THE EARTH\'S SHADOW ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\xe2\x80\x99s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
