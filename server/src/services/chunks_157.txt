Certainly\r\n    the prizes to be won are astronomical and the contestants scarcely\r\n    less so. 

Step right up, little lady and tell us why your eyes look\r\n    so strange! What\'s that? You want us to read this astounding science\r\n    fantasy documentary by J. Anthony Ferlaine first? Well--perhaps we\r\n    should play it safe while the flying saucer folk are watching us!_\r\n\r\n\r\n one\r\n out\r\n  of\r\n ten\r\n\r\n _by ... J. Anthony Ferlaine_\r\n\r\n\r\n There may be a town called Mars in Montana. But\r\n little Mrs. Freda Dunny didn\'t come from there!\r\n\r\n\r\nI watched Don Phillips, the commercial announcer, out of the corner of\r\nmy eye. The camera in front of me swung around and lined up on my set.\r\n\r\n"... And now, on with the show," Phillips was saying. "And here, ready\r\nto test your wits, is your quizzing quiz master, Smiling Jim Parsons."\r\n\r\nI smiled into the camera and waited while the audience applauded. The\r\ncamera tally light went on and the stage manager brought his arm down\r\nand pointed at me.\r\n\r\n"Good afternoon," I said into the camera, "here we go again with another\r\nhalf hour of fun and prizes on television\'s newest, most exciting, game,\r\n\'Parlor Quiz.\' In a moment I\'ll introduce you to our first contestant.\r\nBut first here is a special message to you mothers ..."\r\n\r\nThe baby powder commercial appeared on the monitor and I walked over to\r\nthe next set. They had the first contestant lined up for me. I smiled\r\nand took her card from the floor man. She was a middle-aged woman with a\r\nfaded print dress and old-style shoes. I never saw the contestants\r\nuntil we were on the air. They were screened before the show by the\r\nstaff. They usually tried to pick contestants who would make good show\r\nmaterial--an odd name or occupation--or somebody with twenty kids.\r\nSomething of that nature.\r\n\r\nI looked at the card for the tip off. "Mrs. Freda Dunny," the card said.\r\n"Ask her where she comes from."\r\n\r\nI smiled at the contestant again and took her by the hand. The tally\r\nlight went on again and I grinned into the camera.\r\n\r\n"Well, now, we\'re all set to go ... and our first contestant today is\r\nthis charming little lady right here beside me. Mrs. 

Freda Dunny." I\r\nlooked at the card. "How are you, Mrs. Dunny?"\r\n\r\n"Fine! Just fine."\r\n\r\n"All set to answer a lot of questions and win a lot of prizes?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'ll win all right," said Mrs. Dunny, smiling around at the\r\naudience.\r\n\r\nThe audience tittered a bit at the remark. I looked at the card again.\r\n\r\n"Where are you from, Mrs. Dunny?"\r\n\r\n"Mars!" said Mrs. Dunny.\r\n\r\n"Mars!" I laughed, anticipating the answer. "Mars, Montana? Mars, Peru?"\r\n\r\n"No, _Mars_! Up there," she said, pointing up in the air. "The planet\r\nMars. The fourth planet out from the sun."\r\n\r\nMy assistant looked unhappy.\r\n\r\nI smiled again, wondering what the gag was. I decided to play along.\r\n\r\n"Well, well," I said, "all the way from Mars, eh? And how long have you\r\nbeen on Earth, Mrs. Dunny?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, about thirty or forty years. I\'ve been here nearly all my life.\r\nCame here when I was a wee bit of a girl."\r\n\r\n"Well," I said, "you\'re practically an Earthwoman by now, aren\'t you?"\r\nThe audience laughed. "Do you plan on going back someday or have you\r\nmade up your mind to stay here on Earth for the rest of your days?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m just here for the invasion," said Mrs. Dunny. "When that\'s over\r\nI\'ll probably go back home again."\r\n\r\n"The invasion?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, the invasion of Earth. As soon as enough of us are here we\'ll get\r\nstarted."\r\n\r\n"You mean there are others here, too?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, there are several million of us here in the United States\r\nalready--and more are on the way."\r\n\r\n"There are only about a hundred and seventy million people in the United\r\nStates, Mrs. Dunny," I said. "If there are several million Martians\r\namong us, one out of every hundred would have to be a Martian."\r\n\r\n"One out of every ten!" said Mrs. 

Dunny. 

"That\'s what the boss said just\r\nthe other day. \'We\'re getting pretty close to the number we need to\r\ntake over Earth.\'"\r\n\r\n"What do you need?" I asked. 

"One to one? One Martian for every\r\nEarthman?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," said Mrs. Dunny, "one Martian is worth ten Earthmen. The only\r\nreason we\'re waiting is we don\'t want any trouble."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t look any different from us Earth people, Mrs. Dunny. How does\r\none tell the difference between a Martian and an Earthman when one sees\r\none?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, we don\'t _look_ any different," said Mrs. Dunny. "Some of the kids\r\ndon\'t even know they\'re Martians. Most mothers don\'t tell their children\r\nuntil they\'re grown-up. And there are other children who are never told\r\nbecause they just don\'t develop their full powers."\r\n\r\n"What powers?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, telepathy, thought control--that sort of thing."\r\n\r\n"You mean that Martians can read people\'s thoughts?"\r\n\r\n"Sure! It\'s no trouble at all. It\'s very easy really, once you get the\r\nhang of it."\r\n\r\n"Can you read my mind?" I asked, smiling.\r\n\r\n"Sure!" said Mrs. Dunny, smiling up at me. "That\'s why I said that I\'d\r\nknow the answers. I\'ll be able to read the answers from your mind when\r\nyou look at that sheet of paper."\r\n\r\n"Now, that\'s hardly sporting, is it, Mrs. Dunny?" 

I said, turning to the\r\ncamera. The audience laughed. "Everybody else has to do it the hard way\r\nand here you are reading it from my mind."\r\n\r\n"All\'s fair in love and war," said Mrs. Dunny.\r\n\r\n"Tell me, Mrs. Dunny. Why are you telling me about all this? Isn\'t it\r\nsupposed to be a secret?"\r\n\r\n"I have my reasons," said Mrs. Dunny. "Nobody believes me anyhow."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I believe you, Mrs. Dunny," I said gravely. "And now, let\'s see how\r\nyou do on the questions. 

Are you ready?"\r\n\r\nShe nodded.\r\n\r\n"Name the one and only mammal that has the ability to fly," I asked,\r\nreading from the script.\r\n\r\n"A bat," she said.\r\n\r\n"Right! Did you read that from my mind?

"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, you\'re coming over very clear!" said Mrs. 

Dunny.\r\n\r\n"Try this one," I said. "A princess is any daughter of a sovereign. What\r\nis a princess royal?"\r\n\r\n"The eldest daughter of a sovereign," she said.\r\n\r\n"Correct! 

How about this one? Is a Kodiak a kind of simple box camera; a\r\ntype of double-bowed boat; or a type of Alaskan bear?"\r\n\r\n"A bear," said Mrs. 

Dunny.\r\n\r\n"Very good," I said. "That was a hard one." I asked her seven more\r\nquestions and she got them all right. None of the other contestants even\r\ncame close to her score, so I wound up giving her the gas range and a\r\nlot of other smaller prizes.\r\n\r\nAfter we were off the air I followed the audience out into the hall.\r\nMrs. Dunny was walking towards the lobby with an old paper shopping bag\r\nunder her arm. An attendant was following her with an armful of prizes.\r\n\r\nI caught up with her before she reached the door.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Dunny," I said, and she turned around. 

"I want to talk to you."\r\n\r\n"When do I get the gas stove?" she said.\r\n\r\n"Your local dealer will send it to you in a few days. Did you give them\r\nyour address?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I gave it to them. My Philadelphia address, that is. I don\'t even\r\nremember my address at home any more."\r\n\r\n"Come, now, Mrs. Dunny. You don\'t have to keep up that Mars business now\r\nthat we\'re off the air."\r\n\r\n"It\'s the truth and I didn\'t come here just by accident," said Mrs.\r\nDunny, looking over her shoulder toward the attendant who was still\r\nholding the prizes. "I came here to see you."\r\n\r\n"Me?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Dunny set the paper bag down on the floor and dug down into her\r\npocketbook. She took out a dog-eared piece of white paper and bent it up\r\nin her hand.\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said finally. "I came to see you. And you didn\'t follow me\r\nout here because you wanted to. I commanded you to come."\r\n\r\n"Commanded me to come!" I spluttered. "What for?"\r\n\r\n"To prove something to you. Do you see this piece of paper?" She held\r\nout the paper in her hand with the blank side toward me. "My address is\r\non this paper. I am reading the address. 

Concentrate on what I\'m\r\nreading."\r\n\r\nI looked at her.\r\n\r\nI concentrated.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, I knew.\r\n\r\n"Two fifty-one South Eighth Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania," I said\r\naloud.\r\n\r\n"You see, it\'s very easy once you get the hang of it," she said.\r\n\r\nI nodded and smiled down at her. Now I understood. I picked up her bag\r\nand put my hand on her shoulder.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s go," I said. "We have a lot to talk about."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ November 1956.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
