And they meant\r\n _anything_, including up-to-date hornpipes!_\r\n\r\n\r\n                  NAVY DAY\r\n\r\n             By Harry Harrison\r\n\r\n         Illustrated by Kelly Freas\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Wingrove looked at the rows of faces without seeing them. 

His\r\nvision went beyond the Congress of the United States, past the balmy\r\nJune day to another day that was coming. A day when the Army would have\r\nits destined place of authority.\r\n\r\nHe drew a deep breath and delivered what was perhaps the shortest speech\r\never heard in the hallowed halls of Congress:\r\n\r\n"The General Staff of the U.S. Army requests Congress to abolish the\r\narchaic branch of the armed forces known as the U.S. Navy."\r\n\r\nThe aging Senator from Georgia checked his hearing aid to see if it was\r\nin operating order, while the press box emptied itself in one concerted\r\nrush and a clatter of running feet that died off in the direction of the\r\ntelephone room. A buzz of excited comment ran through the giant chamber.\r\nOne by one the heads turned to face the Naval section where rows of blue\r\nfigures stirred and buzzed like smoked-out bees. The knot of men around\r\na paunchy figure heavy with gold braid broke up and Admiral Fitzjames\r\nclimbed slowly to his feet.\r\n\r\nLesser men have quailed before that piercing stare, but General Wingrove\r\nwas never the lesser man. The admiral tossed his head with disgust,\r\nevery line of his body denoting outraged dignity. He turned to his\r\naudience, a small pulse beating in his forehead.\r\n\r\n"I cannot comprehend the general\'s attitude, nor can I understand why he\r\nhas attacked the Navy in this unwarranted fashion. The Navy has existed\r\nand will always exist as the first barrier of American defense. I ask\r\nyou, gentlemen, to ignore this request as you would ignore the\r\nstatements of any person ... er, slightly demented. I should like to\r\noffer a recommendation that the general\'s sanity be investigated, and an\r\ninquiry be made as to the mental health of anyone else connected with\r\nthis preposterous proposal!"\r\n\r\nThe general smiled calmly. "I understand, Admiral, and really don\'t\r\nblame you for being slightly annoyed. But, please let us not bring this\r\nissue of national importance down to a shallow personal level. The Army\r\nhas facts to back up this request--facts that shall be demonstrated\r\ntomorrow morning."\r\n\r\nTurning his back on the raging admiral, General Wingrove included all\r\nthe assembled solons in one sweeping gesture.\r\n\r\n"Reserve your judgment until that time, gentlemen, make no hasty\r\njudgments until you have seen the force of argument with which we back\r\nup our request. It is the end of an era. In the morning the Navy joins\r\nits fellow fossils, the dodo and the brontosaurus."\r\n\r\nThe admiral\'s blood pressure mounted to a new record and the gentle thud\r\nof his unconscious body striking the floor was the only sound to break\r\nthe shocked silence of the giant hall.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe early morning sun warmed the white marble of the Jefferson Memorial\r\nand glinted from the soldiers\' helmets and the roofs of the packed cars\r\nthat crowded forward in a slow-moving stream. All the gentlemen of\r\nCongress were there, the passage of their cars cleared by the screaming\r\nsirens of motorcycle policemen. 

Around and under the wheels of the\r\nofficial cars pressed a solid wave of government workers and common\r\ncitizens of the capital city. The trucks of the radio and television\r\nservices pressed close, microphones and cameras extended.\r\n\r\nThe stage was set for a great day. Neat rows of olive drab vehicles\r\ncurved along the water\'s edge. Jeeps and half-tracks shouldered close by\r\nweapons carriers and six-bys, all of them shrinking to insignificance\r\nbeside the looming Patton tanks. A speakers\' platform was set up in the\r\ncenter of the line, near the audience.\r\n\r\nAt precisely 10 a.m., General Wingrove stepped forward and scowled at\r\nthe crowd until they settled into an uncomfortable silence. His speech\r\nwas short and consisted of nothing more than amplifications of his\r\nopening statement that actions speak louder than words. He pointed to\r\nthe first truck in line, a 2\xc2\xbd-ton filled with an infantry squad sitting\r\nstiffly at attention.\r\n\r\nThe driver caught the signal and kicked the engine into life; with a\r\ngrind of gears it moved forward toward the river\'s edge. There was an\r\nindrawn gasp from the crowd as the front wheels ground over the marble\r\nparapet--then the truck was plunging down toward the muddy waters of the\r\nPotomac.\r\n\r\nThe wheels touched the water and the surface seemed to sink while taking\r\non a strange glassy character. The truck roared into high gear and rode\r\nforward on the surface of the water surrounded by a saucer-shaped\r\ndepression. It parked two hundred yards off shore and the soldiers,\r\ngoaded by the sergeant\'s bark, leapt out and lined up with a showy\r\n_present arms_.\r\n\r\nThe general returned the salute and waved to the remaining vehicles.\r\nThey moved forward in a series of maneuvers that indicated a great\r\nnumber of rehearsal hours on some hidden pond. The tanks rumbled slowly\r\nover the water while the jeeps cut back and forth through their lines in\r\nintricate patterns. The trucks backed and turned like puffing\r\nballerinas.\r\n\r\nThe audience was rooted in a hushed silence, their eyeballs bulging.\r\nThey continued to watch the amazing display as General Wingrove spoke\r\nagain:\r\n\r\n"You see before you a typical example of Army ingenuity, developed in\r\nArmy laboratories. These motor units are supported on the surface of the\r\nwater by an intensifying of the surface tension in their immediate area.\r\nTheir weight is evenly distributed over the surface, causing the shallow\r\ndepressions you see around them.\r\n\r\n"This remarkable feat has been accomplished by the use of the\r\n_Dornifier_. A remarkable invention that is named after that brilliant\r\nscientist, Colonel Robert A. Dorn, Commander of the Brooke Point\r\nExperimental Laboratory. It was there that one of the civilian employees\r\ndiscovered the Dorn effect--under the Colonel\'s constant guidance, of\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\n"Utilizing this invention the Army now becomes master of the sea as well\r\nas the land. Army convoys of trucks and tanks can blanket the world. 

The\r\nsurface of the water is our highway, our motor park, our\r\nbattleground--the airfield and runway for our planes."\r\n\r\nMechanics were pushing a Shooting Star onto the water. They stepped\r\nclear as flame gushed from the tail pipe; with the familiar whooshing\r\nrumble it sped down the Potomac and hurled itself into the air.\r\n\r\n"When this cheap and simple method of crossing oceans is adopted, it\r\nwill of course mean the end of that fantastic medieval anachronism, the\r\nNavy. No need for billion-dollar aircraft carriers, battleships,\r\ndrydocks and all the other cumbersome junk that keeps those boats and\r\nthings afloat. Give the taxpayer back his hard-earned dollar!"\r\n\r\nTeeth grated in the Naval section as carriers and battleships were\r\ncalled "boats" and the rest of America\'s sea might lumped under the\r\ncasual heading of "things." Lips were curled at the transparent appeal\r\nto the taxpayer\'s pocketbook. 

But with leaden hearts they knew that all\r\nthis justified wrath and contempt would avail them nothing. This was\r\nArmy Day with a vengeance, and the doom of the Navy seemed inescapable.\r\n\r\nThe Army had made elaborate plans for what they called "Operation\r\nSinker." Even as the general spoke the publicity mills ground into high\r\ngear. From coast to coast the citizens absorbed the news with their\r\nmorning nourishment.\r\n\r\n"... Agnes, you hear what the radio said! The Army\'s gonna give a trip\r\naround the world in a B-36 as first prize in this limerick contest. All\r\nyou have to do is fill in the last line, and mail one copy to the\r\nPentagon and the other to the Navy ..."\r\n\r\nThe Naval mail room had standing orders to burn all the limericks when\r\nthey came in, but some of the newer men seemed to think the entire thing\r\nwas a big joke. Commander Bullman found one in the mess hall:\r\n\r\n    _The Army will always be there,\r\n    On the land, on the sea, in the air.\r\n    So why should the Navy\r\n    Take all of the gravy ..._\r\n\r\nto which a seagoing scribe had added:\r\n\r\n    _And not give us ensigns our share?_\r\n\r\nThe newspapers were filled daily with photographs of mighty B-36\'s\r\nlanding on Lake Erie, and grinning soldiers making mock beachhead\r\nattacks on Coney Island. Each man wore a buzzing black box at his waist\r\nand walked on the bosom of the now quiet Atlantic like a biblical\r\nprophet.\r\n\r\nRadio and television also carried the thousands of news releases that\r\npoured in an unending flow from the Pentagon Building. 

Cards, letters,\r\ntelegrams and packages descended on Washington in an overwhelming\r\ntorrent. The Navy Department was the unhappy recipient of deprecatory\r\nletters and a vast quantity of little cardboard battleships.\r\n\r\nThe people spoke and their representatives listened closely. This was an\r\nelection year. There didn\'t seem to be much doubt as to the decision,\r\nparticularly when the reduction in the budget was considered.\r\n\r\nIt took Congress only two months to make up its collective mind. The\r\npeople were all pro-Army. The novelty of the idea had fired their\r\nimaginations.\r\n\r\nThey were about to take the final vote in the lower house. If the\r\namendment passed it would go to the states for ratification, and their\r\nvotes were certain to follow that of Congress. The Navy had fought a\r\nlast-ditch battle to no avail. The balloting was going to be pretty much\r\nof a sure thing--the wet water Navy would soon become ancient history.\r\n\r\nFor some reason the admirals didn\'t look as unhappy as they should.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Naval Department had requested one last opportunity to address the\r\nCongress. Congress had patronizingly granted permission, for even the\r\ndoomed man is allowed one last speech. Admiral Fitzjames, who had\r\nrecovered from his choleric attack, was the appointed speaker.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen of the Congress of the United States. We in the Navy have a\r\nfighting tradition. 

We \'damn the torpedoes\' and sail straight ahead into\r\nthe enemy\'s fire if that is necessary. We have been stabbed in the\r\nback--we have suffered a second Pearl Harbor sneak attack! The Army\r\nrelinquished its rights to fair treatment with this attack. 

Therefore we\r\nare _counter-attacking_!" Worn out by his attacking and mixed metaphors,\r\nthe Admiral mopped his brow.\r\n\r\n"Our laboratories have been working night and day on the perfection of a\r\ndevice we hoped we would never be forced to use. It is now in operation,\r\nhaving passed the final trials a few days ago.\r\n\r\n"The significance of this device _cannot_ be underestimated. We are so\r\npositive of its importance that--we are _demanding_ that the _Army_ be\r\nabolished!"\r\n\r\nHe waved his hand toward the window and bellowed one word.\r\n\r\n"LOOK!"\r\n\r\nEveryone looked. 

They blinked and looked again. They rubbed their eyes\r\nand kept looking.\r\n\r\nSailing majestically up the middle of Constitution Avenue was the\r\nbattleship Missouri.\r\n\r\nThe Admiral\'s voice rang through the room like a trumpet of victory.\r\n\r\n"The Mark-1 Debinder, as you see, temporarily lessens the binding\r\nenergies that hold molecules of solid matter together. Solids become\r\nliquids, and a ship equipped with this device can sail anywhere in the\r\nworld--on sea _or_ land. 

Take your vote, gentlemen; the world awaits\r\nyour decision."\r\n\r\n                                                           ...

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\xe2\x80\x99s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
