The robots somehow managed to avoid clanking there; the\r\ngreensward beyond the veranda was always just right, and the drinks\r\nwere the best for six counties. Old Ned Brussels touched his glass to\r\nhis lips appreciatively, sighed in contentment, and waited for some of\r\nthe other oldsters to break the silence.\r\n\r\nFinally, Lem Hardy took the plunge. "He did it," he announced,\r\nreferring to a conversation of weeks before. 

Then, at their puzzled\r\nlooks, he amplified. "My grandson, damn it! He\'s got a time machine--it\r\nworks. Sent a cat four days up, and it came through unharmed."\r\n\r\nThe glass fell from Old Ned\'s hand, bouncing on the floor, and spilling\r\ngood liquor. A robot came forward silently to clean it up, but Ned\r\ndidn\'t look at it. "Four days doesn\'t mean a thing. Lem--is that kid\r\nplanning on trying it out?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s going to try it next week."\r\n\r\n"Then for the Lord\'s sake, stop him! 

Look, does it work like this?" His\r\nfingers slipped over the pencil smoothly, as they had always done when\r\nhe worked, drafting robot bodies in the old days. A rude schematic\r\nseemed to grow almost instantly on the paper.\r\n\r\nLem took it, then stiffened suddenly. "Who told you?"\r\n\r\n"A youngster named Pete LeFranc--and it was forty years ... no, over\r\nfifty years ago. Lem, if you like your grandson, keep him out of the\r\nmachine. Four days, four weeks--they don\'t mean anything. Time machines\r\ndon\'t work, however well they seem to.

"\r\n\r\nA bustle from behind them pulled their eyes around. One of the robots\r\nwas quietly restraining a nervous young man who was trying to break\r\nfree and join the group. His face was tense, excited, with an odd\r\nbitter fear behind it. 

His words were seemingly cut out of steel. "...\r\ntold me I\'d find him here. Damn it...."\r\n\r\n"Sorry, sir. 

You\'ll have to wait." The robot\'s voice was adamant under\r\nits smoothness.\r\n\r\nNed grunted, and then impulse led him to look again. He\'d seen the\r\nman somewhere. He hunted for it, then dismissed it, knowing that\r\nhis memory was tricky these days. But he motioned the robot aside.\r\n"We don\'t allow interruptions for junior members," he told the man,\r\nletting his voice soften the words. "Still, if you want to sit down and\r\nlisten--quietly--nobody\'ll stop you."\r\n\r\n"But...."\r\n\r\n"_Quietly!_" The robot stressed the word. The man looked at it, then\r\nswiveled to Ned Brussels. For a moment, the bitterness halted, as if\r\nfrozen, then gave place to a sudden sharp amusement. His eyes searched\r\nNed\'s, and he nodded, dropping into a chair.\r\n\r\nLem took up the conversation again. "It worked. And if it works for\r\nfour days, it should work for four centuries. You\'re just scared of\r\nparadoxes, Ned--going back and killing your grandfather, or such rot.\r\nYou\'ve been reading too many stories on it."\r\n\r\n"Fifty years ago, Pete LeFranc said the same thing. Young man, either\r\nsit down, or get out! This is the Old Men\'s section! He had answers for\r\nall the paradoxes, too--except one question."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNed had been young, then, just getting started at synthanatomy\r\ndrafting, and not rich enough for wine of the type Pete always kept. He\r\nsipped it with relish, and looked at the odd cage Pete was displaying.\r\n"All the same, it won\'t work!"\r\n\r\nPete laughed. "Reality doesn\'t mean a thing to an artist, does it? Be\r\ndamned to your paradoxes--there\'s some answer to them. It did work; the\r\ndog appeared exactly four weeks later, just finishing his bark!"\r\n\r\n"Then why haven\'t time machines come back from the future?" Ned shot at\r\nhim. He\'s been saving that as his final argument, and he sat back to\r\nwatch the bomb explode.\r\n\r\nFor a second, Pete blinked. "You never figured that out yourself."\r\n\r\n"Nope. I got it from a science fiction story. 

But why haven\'t they? If\r\nyours works, there\'ll be more time machines built. With more built,\r\nthey\'ll be improved. They\'ll get to be commonplace. People\'d use\r\nthem--and someone would turn up here with one. Or in the past. Why\r\nhaven\'t we met time travellers, Pete?"\r\n\r\n"Maybe we have met them, but didn\'t know it?"\r\n\r\n"Nonsense. You get in that machine and go back to Elizabethan England.\r\nTry to pass yourself off as being native to that time even an hour. No,\r\nthere\'d be slip-ups."\r\n\r\nPete considered it, pouring more wine. "An idea--but you\'re right,\r\nmaybe. I haven\'t tried going back--if I\'d sent the dog backwards, I\r\ncouldn\'t have checked up on it, while I could be waiting in the future.\r\nOkay, you\'ve convinced me."\r\n\r\n"Then you\'re not going in the contraption."\r\n\r\nPete\'s laughter was spontaneous and loaded with amusement. "I\'m\r\ngoing forward and find out why no one has come back! I\'ve got a nice\r\ncollection of rare coins I can trade off up there--should be more\r\nvaluable--and I\'ll bring you back a working invention from the next\r\ncentury. With luck, I\'ll bring you the answer. And after that, maybe I\r\ncan go back and kill an ancestor, just to see what happens.

"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be a fool!"\r\n\r\nBut Pete was grinning, and opening the door to the cage that rested\r\nin the middle of his laboratory. "Fifty years this trip," he said,\r\nspinning the dials. "And you won\'t have long to wait; I\'ll come back\r\njust about in no time."\r\n\r\nNed started to yell something, but there was a curious flicker, such\r\nas he\'d seen when Pete sent the dog forward. The time machine blurred\r\nover, its surface seeming to stretch into infinity while contracting to\r\nnothing at the same time.\r\n\r\nThen it was gone. Ned groped for the wine bottle, cursing, and drained\r\nthe contents. Then he sat down to wait.\r\n\r\nThree days later, the police came looking for Pete, on some mysterious\r\ntip, probably from a fellow worker. It was a pretty rough time, for a\r\nwhile, though they finally decided it was just another mystery, and\r\nthat Ned\'s yarn of having been there only to keep an appointment was\r\ntrue. Ned had influential friends, even if he didn\'t have money, then.\r\n\r\nFor three years, he rented Pete\'s laboratory, before he made enough to\r\nbuy it. For a decade, he lived in it; but by then he\'d begun to know\r\nthat Pete wasn\'t coming back.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"The building\'s still there," Old Ned finished. "The diagrams of his\r\nmachine are still in the drawers. But Pete never showed up. I tell you,\r\nkeep your fool grandson out of time machines, Lem. They don\'t work. Too\r\nmany paradoxes--if they\'d work, you could steal a future invention, get\r\ncredit for inventing it, and nobody would ever have to invent it. When\r\nthings have that many angles that can\'t work, the thing itself can\'t\r\nwork.

"\r\n\r\nLem shook his head stubbornly. "It worked; the kid got the cat back.\r\nSomething just happened to your friend--maybe his power failed."\r\n\r\n"Then he wouldn\'t have gotten all the way--and he\'d have reappeared\r\nyears ago. Pete measured things--and there was no displacement in\r\nspace. If something had happened to him, the machine would have been\r\nthere, anyhow. Besides, I had alarms wired to call the police in--told\r\n\'em it was to protect a safe--the minute he showed up. He never showed\r\nup; he never came back.

"\r\n\r\n"So I suppose he just disappeared--time ate him up?" Lem\'s stubbornness\r\nwas cracking a bit, though. His voice was higher than even an old man\'s\r\nshould be.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. But time machines don\'t work. Otherwise where are the\r\ntime travellers from the future?"\r\n\r\nThey sat quietly for a second. Ned was remembering the years, up to the\r\ntime he\'d given up, disconnected the alarms, and come here to the Arts\r\nand Science Club to live. He\'d been stubborn, maybe--a little bit--but\r\nPete hadn\'t reappeared.\r\n\r\nBehind him, the young man cleared his throat, and the robot moved\r\nforward. But there was no rule against intrusion when no one was\r\nspeaking, and the robot came to a stop. Ned looked back, just as the\r\nman decided the robot wouldn\'t interfere. There was more amusement on\r\nthe man\'s face now, but the bitterness still lay there.\r\n\r\nHe grinned at Ned, a familiar grin, and his voice was flat and\r\npositive. "Time machines work. And there are no paradoxes--absolutely\r\nno paradoxes!"\r\n\r\nLem stirred, craning back, and Ned bristled. But something about the\r\nyounger man caught back the words, as he picked up the thin thread of\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nThe other grinned again, wryly. 

"It\'s simple. Time machines work in\r\none direction--they can\'t go back. Your time traveller found that out\r\ntoo late. No trips to the past, no return from the future--and no\r\nparadoxes, Ned Brussels."\r\n\r\nHe came to his feet, moving over to drop into the chair beside Ned. The\r\nolder man nodded, stretching out his hand.\r\n\r\n"I told you not to try the damned machine, Pete," Ned told him. Then he\r\nchuckled as the oldest cliche among old friends meeting again came to\r\nhis lips. "Fifty years--and you haven\'t changed a bit, Pete LeFranc!"\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ABSOLUTELY NO PARADOX ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
