Wanna bet?\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n                          Infinity June 1958.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n"Temporal paradoxes," Pangborn said, in that extra-stuffy tone he used\r\nwhen he wanted to give us an adequate idea of his superiority, "are not\r\nto be regarded as inconsistencies per se."\r\n\r\n"Why not?" demanded Doctor Randall\'s voice from the depth of his wing\r\nchair. All we had been able to see of him for the past half-hour had\r\nbeen his legs, but apparently Pangborn\'s tone had been too much. "Prove\r\nit!"\r\n\r\nPangborn\'s tone became even more lofty. "My own theory is that such\r\nparadoxes, if reduced to practice, would prove not to be paradoxical\r\nat all."\r\n\r\n"Such as the famous idea about going back and killing one\'s\r\ngrandparents?" Von Juntz asked, stroking his beard.\r\n\r\nWe all like to have our little oddities on the faculty at Miskatonic.\r\nVon Juntz liked to look like a nineteenth century Heidelberger.\r\nPangborn of Physics liked to assume a personality pattern that would\r\nannoy people. Doctor Randall of the Department of Advertising Arts\r\nwrote poetry in secret. 

And I liked to drink....\r\n\r\n"Problem of killing grandparents before parents were born," I said,\r\npouring myself another. "Question if you can be born after that.\r\nQuestion if you can\'t be born, how did you do it? Not really possible,\r\nPangborn. 

You can\'t test it." I made a mental note to bring up the\r\nlow quality of Faculty Club whiskey at the next business meeting. It\r\nhad everything else a good faculty club should have: brown leather\r\narmchairs, old magazines, fresh newspapers, a dusty chess board, cut\r\nglass decanters ... it was a place well suited for comfortable reading,\r\ntalking and drinking--except for the quality of the whiskey.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t kill grandpa," Doctor Randall said, from far down in his\r\ncomfortable chair. "No such thing as time travel."\r\n\r\n"You underestimate the Physics department," Pangborn told us coldly.\r\n"In spite of heavy losses to our staff--last year\'s treason trials\r\ncost us three of our most brilliant young men--we\'ve made some\r\nvery remarkable strides. We have what is crudely termed a time\r\nmachine--although the correct term is temporal transducer. In fact we\r\nare currently conducting some very interesting researches with it."\r\n\r\n"Then you have tried the killing of a grandfather, Herr Doctor?" Von\r\nJuntz inquired. "You have found why it cannot be done, yes?"\r\n\r\n"We have not yet gotten around to such minor matters," Pangborn\r\nsaid. "But in time...." He began to look interested, "Ah ... wait a\r\nminute.... In practice that would be.... Whose grandfather should we\r\nchoose?" His eyes glittered. "There is always the question of risk, of\r\ncourse, but it would be difficult for the law to legally consider it as\r\nactually murder. My grandfather is already dead." He hesitated. 

"There\r\nis the possibility of disappearing."\r\n\r\n"But," Von Juntz reminded him, "by your own statement you said it, that\r\nthere is no paradox, and no risk. Grandpa would be dead, you would be\r\nalive, and there is no paradox, yes?"\r\n\r\n"Q. E. 

D." Pangborn snapped. "Reduction ad absorbum."\r\n\r\n"Et pons asinorum," Von Juntz snapped back, his beard bristling.\r\n\r\nThese exchanges would have been ever so much better if any of us had\r\never taken Latin. But I could see that Pangborn was ruffled.\r\n\r\n"Very well." He bit off the words. 

"We\'ll do it."\r\n\r\n"Whose grandfather?" asked Doctor Randall.\r\n\r\nPangborn\'s eyes glittered. "Mine, naturally. I wouldn\'t want to\r\nendanger any of you gentlemen. After all, it is my demonstration. I\r\nremember my grandfather jabbing me in the belly with a great horny\r\nfinger when I was too young to defend myself. Giddygiddy, he used to\r\nsay, the old buzzard. Died naturally. Apoplexy with a fan dancer it\r\nwas, in a hotel room at the age of ninety-three. Disgraceful. 

Nobody\r\never shot him. Don\'t understand why not. 

Long overdue." Pangborn rubbed\r\nhis hands together and started for the door. "How about it? Will you\r\ngentlemen accompany me to the Physics department?"\r\n\r\n[illus]\r\n\r\nOn the way over Randall nudged me and spoke out of the side of his\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n"Three to one Pangborn vanishes."\r\n\r\nIt seemed like good odds. If Pangborn managed to prevent his father\r\nfrom being born, logically he should prevent himself from being born.\r\nBut I couldn\'t visualize him vanishing. Common sense was against it.\r\n"I\'ll cover that." I gave Randall three dollars.\r\n\r\nIf Pangborn did not vanish, Randall would owe me nine. If Pangborn did\r\nnot vanish I would be disappointed, and money would be some consolation.\r\n\r\nPangborn passed us through the security guards and into the Physics\r\nlaboratories. No need to describe the temporal transducer, it looked\r\nlike the usual thing in gadgets--coils, tubes, pipes, condensers,\r\nwires, tubes--with a little screen overhead that lets the operator,\r\nwho stays behind, watch what is happening to his passenger. Pangborn\r\nwas extremely proud of it. He showed us all over the machine, pointing\r\nand naming every part. Von Juntz got his beard caught in a control\r\nwheel.\r\n\r\nThat made Pangborn almost good-natured.\r\n\r\nThen he wanted to choose someone to operate the machine for him. He\r\nsaid my hands shook too much, and Von Juntz would not allow his beard\r\nto get within five feet of the controls, so we steadied Doctor Randall\r\nagainst a safety railing and instructed him how to operate the machine.\r\nPangborn set the dials.\r\n\r\n"There\'s one place where I\'m certain to find Grandfather any time\r\nbetween 1893 and 1906," Pangborn told us. "The Andrew Jackson Saloon\r\nBar on Decatur Street. He spent a lot of time there. Used it for his\r\noffice they tell me. He was a lawyer. I\'ve set the machine for there,\r\nfor the month of September 1896. A good month to die in. 

Ha!" Pangborn\r\nostentatiously checked the cylinders of a huge antique revolver.\r\n\r\n"Forty-five caliber," Pangborn said grimly. "Poke me, will he? 

Ha!"\r\n\r\nAnd he climbed into the machine.\r\n\r\nAll of us crowded around the screen, Von Juntz carefully holding his\r\nbeard. We saw the picture forming, the cut glass and bright gas lamps\r\nand polished wood of the Saloon Bar.\r\n\r\n"_Four_ to one Pangborn vanishes," Randall said suddenly, "Any takers,\r\nspeak now."\r\n\r\nI reached for my wallet.\r\n\r\nVon Juntz said, "If he vanishes, it will be because he was never born.\r\nAnd if he was never born, you won\'t remember taking bets on him."\r\n\r\n"Here," I said hastily to Randall, "I gave you some already. I\'ll hold\r\nmy money, hand it back."\r\n\r\nRandall withdrew a little. "Don\'t you trust me?" he asked in a hurt\r\ntone. "I\'ll pay you if he doesn\'t vanish."\r\n\r\n"Shhh," Von Juntz said. We crowded around the screen again.\r\n\r\nThe screen looked down on the bar from above and behind it, like\r\nlooking in through a window set above the mirror. And at the bar was\r\nonly one solitary customer, a tall lean man in a frock coat and plug\r\nhat with a cigar from which smoke curled richly, and a schooner of\r\nbeer before him. He looked up at the bar mirror, and we saw a lean,\r\nevilly humorous face with the Pangborn features clearly marked on it.\r\n"Grandpa," Von Juntz whispered.\r\n\r\nIn a dark angle of the place, Pangborn himself materialized from the\r\nmachine. We saw a glimmer as he raised the gun.\r\n\r\n"See," Von Juntz whispered. "He has forgotten to uncock the safety. Now\r\nhe has. Now he creeps closer. Soon now we shall know the paradox."\r\n\r\nGrandpa Pangborn had put down his cigar. His hand had slid under the\r\nlapel of his frock coat. Just before he whirled, I realized that he had\r\nbeen watching Pangborn in the mirror all the time.\r\n\r\nHe whirled, his hand whipped out from beneath his lapel, and the sound\r\nof a gunshot echoed in the saloon. We had a clear view of the angry\r\nsurprise on Pangborn\'s face before he toppled nose down into the\r\nsawdust. He was quite obviously dead.\r\n\r\n"Whippersnapper," Grandpa Pangborn muttered. He holstered his gun and\r\nlooked up, and his lean face oddly seemed to be looking straight into\r\nthe peering eye of the time viewer, and into our staring eyes. We could\r\nnot be seen.... Or could we?\r\n\r\nLooking at us, he spoke.\r\n\r\n"Figure that one out!" said Grandpa Pangborn. I cut the switch, and the\r\nviewer went black.\r\n\r\nThe way I see it, Pangborn vanished, but not in the right way, so\r\nRandall owes me nine dollars. But he says he won the bet, and he won\'t\r\neven give me back the three I handed him before Pangborn got into that\r\nfool machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PANGBORN\'S PARADOX ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!)

It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
