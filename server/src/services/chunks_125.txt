]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe storm ruined my plan.\r\n\r\nNot by seasickness. I\'d come prepared for the worst, knowing how rough\r\nit could get on a sailing ship of the Nineteenth Century. I outrode the\r\nstorm easily, stowed away in the hold. Not even the breakage of some of\r\nthe 1700 barrels of alcohol carried as a cargo bothered me although the\r\nstench was terrific.\r\n\r\nBut on the morning of 25 November 1872, the first mate, Albert\r\nRichardson sent the second mate, Andrew Gilling below with two of the\r\nGerman seamen to assay the storm damage. They found me and I was hauled\r\naloft before Captain Briggs as a stowaway.\r\n\r\nCaptain Briggs of the _Mary Celeste_ eyed my strange clothing with\r\ndeep curiosity, but his interest was obviously more concerned with my\r\nunauthorized presence. He said sternly, "When did you get aboard?"\r\n\r\nI realized that I had to impress him. I smiled. "You delayed your\r\nsailing from the Fifth November to the Sixth so that you and Mrs.\r\nBriggs could have dinner aboard _Die Gratia_ with Captain\r\nMorehouse," I said.\r\n\r\n"How can you know so much?" he exclaimed. "How can you live as a\r\nstowaway for almost twenty days?"\r\n\r\nI held up my chronithon contactor, knowing that now I could impress him\r\nindeed. "Captain Briggs," I said, "I am a time-travelling historian\r\nfrom the Twenty-Second Century." I pointed to the big red button on the\r\ntop. "Until I depress this button and return to my own day and age,\r\nevery morning I receive my daily ration of food and water. It\'s about--"\r\n\r\nI\'d timed it close. I was interrupted by the click of the chronithon as\r\nit time-transferred my daily ration. I opened the cabinet and offered a\r\nbite of twenty-second century breakfast to the captain.\r\n\r\nHe said, "This is a sailor\'s tall tale, I think. You claim that you\'re\r\na time-travelling historian? Then tell me, why are you here on _Mary\r\nCeleste_?"\r\n\r\n"Captain Briggs," I said, "the Time Machine was invented in Nineteen\r\nEighty-Seven. Within twenty years every historical event had been\r\npainstakingly researched and authentically written--re-written--by\r\ntime-travelling historians who viewed the event as partaking\r\neye-witnesses. By my time, fame and fortune awaits any man who has\r\nthe luck and dogged determination to scour historic time to locate\r\nsome event that has not been recounted faithfully to the last niggling\r\nlittle detail. Why, Captain Briggs, in Jim Bishop\'s famous \'The Day\r\nColumbus Landed\' they record the name of the man who owned the hen that\r\nlaid the egg that Columbus stood on end to impress Isabella with his\r\nability. And so, Captain Briggs, I stowed away because I--"\r\n\r\nA woman\'s voice interrupted me, I turned to look at the captain\'s wife\r\nwho, of course, was the only woman aboard _Mary Celeste_. She was\r\ncarrying little Sophia Matilda in her arms. She said, "Edward, what\r\nunearthly manner of ship is that?"\r\n\r\nThe steward, Edward Head replied, "I don\'t rightly know, ma-am."\r\n\r\nI turned to look. No more than fifty feet from the starboard rail was\r\na vast barge. Upon the barge were serried rows of seats that stretched\r\nupwards and backwards for hundreds of feet. The seats were filling\r\nrapidly; ushers were escorting the spectators efficiently, vendors\r\nwere selling refreshments and programs. A thrumming sound came from\r\noverhead and I looked up to watch the materialization of jetcopters and\r\npersonnel carriers and even a poised spacecraft hanging in a dome above\r\nour heads.\r\n\r\nOver the lee rail came a crew of technicians carrying the heavy\r\nWard-Workman tridi recorders of the twenty-seventh century, and their\r\ndirector pulled a script from his pocket and said:\r\n\r\n"Joe, you and Pete dislocate the binnacle and break the compass. Al,\r\nopen the fore hatch and lazarette. Tony, that spring-wound chronometer\r\nis a pre-atomic clock and worth a fortune to the National Museum,\r\nput it among my personal loot, along with the sextant. You can keep\r\nthe ship\'s register, but give the navigation books to George with my\r\ncompliments. 

Let\'s see, um. 

Sails, jib and fore-topmast. Now toss\r\nthe yawl overboard; get it out of the way. It\'s missing." 

One of his\r\nmen came up and said something to him that I could not hear. "No,"\r\nhe replied, "It would not be more dramatic to dummy-up a half-eaten\r\nbreakfast and a pan of milk warming on the stove for the baby. Too\r\nmany writers tried to make it that way in the beginning. 

I know what\'s\r\nauthentic."\r\n\r\nThen he paused as the Ward-Workman cameramen panned around _Mary\r\nCeleste_ making close-up and approach shots. One by one they\r\nfinished their work and reported to him.\r\n\r\n"Fine," he said, looking at his strapwatch. "Now let\'s back off for\r\nsome long shots. 

And remember, we don\'t know what kind of a catastrophe\r\nthis is going to be, so keep those tridi recorders running constantly\r\nuntil I tell you to stop!"\r\n\r\nCaptain Benjamin Spooner Briggs of _Mary Celeste_ put an arm\r\naround his wife. To me he said, "I don\'t completely understand, but I\r\ndo get enough to realize that we\'re the subject of something evil."\r\n\r\n"Yes," I replied, "you--"\r\n\r\n"We\'re not waiting here to let it happen to us!" he snapped.\r\n\r\n"But you can\'t change history!" 

I objected.\r\n\r\n"Watch," he said roughly. And then with a stentorian voice, Captain\r\nBriggs roared: "_Abandon ship!_"\r\n\r\nThe captain and his wife, still carrying their daughter Sophia Matilda,\r\nmingled with the photorecording crew. The two mates, the steward,\r\nand the four German seamen went over the side and swam swiftly for\r\nthe barges. There were flurries of activity when they went aboard\r\nthe barges, but then the activity stilled and I was alone on _Mary\r\nCeleste_.\r\n\r\nI looked around me and realized that Captain Briggs hadn\'t changed\r\nhistory. He\'d made it!\r\n\r\nSlowly the barges emptied, the spectators returned to their own time\r\nand place among the Centuries. Sorrowfully I pressed my button and went\r\nhome. My fame would never be, my fortune would never start. My book\r\nwould remain unwritten, for I knew full well that potential customer\r\nfor this historic event had been here as an eye-witness. After seeing\r\nit, who\'d bother to buy my book?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn 4 December, 1872, Captain Morehouse of _Die Gratia_ sighted\r\n_Mary Celeste_ yawing in a mild sea with jib and fore-topmast\r\nsails set, no one at the helm and no one aboard. The binnacle was\r\nknocked out of place, the compass was broken. The sextant, the\r\nchronometer, ship\'s register and navigation books were missing. The\r\nship\'s yawl, lashed to the main hatch was missing. The fore hatch\r\nand lazarette were open and about a dozen of the ship\'s cargo of 1701\r\nbarrels of alcohol were broken or leaking badly.\r\n\r\nThe last notation in the ship\'s deck log had been made early in the\r\nmorning of 25 November 1872, and the account of the previous hours\r\nindicated that _Mary Celeste_ had come through a severe storm on\r\nthe previous day and most of the night.\r\n\r\nAccounts that include half-eaten plates of food, half-packed bags and\r\nother evidences of an abrupt interruption and panicky flight for safety\r\nare false.\r\n\r\nNo survivors have ever turned up, no explanation can be given.\r\nResearchers in the "Mystery of _Mary Celeste_" suggest that the\r\nstorm, the leaking alcohol, combined to frighten Captain Briggs with a\r\nthreat of fire or explosion and that they all took off in the ship\'s\r\nyawl, which floundered.\r\n\r\nWe will not know the truth until someone invents the Time Machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TIME FOR SURVIVAL ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!)

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
