]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   It was the awfullest dream in the\r\n                 world, no doubt about it. In fact, it\r\n                seemed to be the only dream there was!\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was a morning type, so it was unusual that he should feel depressed\r\nin the morning. He tried to account for it, and could not.\r\n\r\nHe was a healthy man, so he ate a healthy breakfast. He was not too\r\ndepressed for that. And he listened unconsciously to the dark girl with\r\nthe musical voice. Often she ate at Cahill\'s in the mornings with her\r\ngirl friend.\r\n\r\nGrape juice, pineapple juice, orange juice, apple juice ... why did\r\npeople look at him suspiciously just because he took four or five sorts\r\nof juice for breakfast?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Agnes, it was ghastly. I was built like a sack. 

A sackful of skunk\r\ncabbage, I swear. And I was a green-brown color and had hair like a\r\nlatrine mop. Agnes, I was sick with misery. It just isn\'t possible for\r\nanybody to feel so low. I can\'t shake it at all. And the whole world\r\nwas like the underside of a log. It wasn\'t that, though. It wasn\'t just\r\none bunch of things. It was everything. It was a world where things\r\njust weren\'t worth living. I can\'t come out of it...."\r\n\r\n"Teresa, it was only a dream."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSausage, only four little links for an order. Did people think he was a\r\nglutton because he had four orders of sausage? It didn\'t seem like very\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\n"My mother was a monster. She was a wart-hoggish animal. And yet she\r\nwas still recognizable. How could my mother look like a wart-hog and\r\nstill look like my mother? Mama\'s pretty!"\r\n\r\n"Teresa, it was only a dream. 

Forget it."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe stares a man must suffer just to get a dozen pancakes on his plate!\r\nWhat was the matter with people who called four pancakes a tall stack?\r\nAnd what was odd about ordering a quarter of a pound of butter? It was\r\nbetter than having twenty of those little pats each on its coaster.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Agnes, we all of us had eyes that bugged out. 

And we stank! We were\r\nbloated, and all the time it rained a dirty green rain that smelled\r\nlike a four letter word. Good grief, girl! We had hair all over us\r\nwhere we weren\'t warts. And we talked like cracked crows. We had\r\ncrawlers. I itch just from thinking about it. And the dirty parts of\r\nthe dream I won\'t even tell you. I\'ve never felt so blue in my life. I\r\njust don\'t know how I\'ll make the day through."\r\n\r\n"Teresa, doll, how could a dream upset you so much?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere isn\'t a thing wrong with ordering three eggs sunny-side up, and\r\nthree over easy, and three poached ever so soft, and six of them\r\nscrambled. What law says a man should have all of his eggs fixed alike?\r\nNor is there anything wrong with ordering five cups of coffee. That way\r\nthe girl doesn\'t have to keep running over with refills.\r\n\r\nBascomb Swicegood liked to have bacon and waffles after the egg\r\ninterlude and the earlier courses. But he was nearly at the end of his\r\nbreakfast when he jumped up.\r\n\r\n"What did she say?"\r\n\r\nHe was surprised at the violence of his own voice.\r\n\r\n"What did who say, Mr. Swicegood?"\r\n\r\n"The girl that was just here, that just left with the other girl."\r\n\r\n"That was Teresa, and the other girl was Agnes. Or else that was Agnes\r\nand the other girl was Teresa. It depends on which girl you mean. 

I\r\ndon\'t know what either of them said."\r\n\r\nBascomb ran out into the street.\r\n\r\n"Girl, the girl who said it rained dirty green all the time, what\'s\r\nyour name?"\r\n\r\n"My name is Teresa. You\'ve met me four times. 

Every morning you look\r\nlike you never saw me before."\r\n\r\n"I\'m Agnes," said Agnes.\r\n\r\n"What did you mean it rained dirty green all the time? Tell me all\r\nabout it.

"\r\n\r\n"I will not, Mr. Swicegood. I was just telling a dream I had to Agnes.\r\nIt isn\'t any of your business."\r\n\r\n"Well, I have to hear all of it. Tell me everything you dreamed."\r\n\r\n"I will not. It was a dirty dream. It isn\'t any of your business. If\r\nyou weren\'t a friend of my Uncle Ed Kelly, I\'d call a policeman for\r\nyour bothering me."\r\n\r\n"Did you have things like live rats in your stomach to digest for you?\r\nDid they--"\r\n\r\n"Oh! How did you know? 

Get away from me. I _will_ call a policeman. Mr.\r\nMcCarty, this man is annoying me."\r\n\r\n"The devil he is, Miss Ananias. Old Bascomb just doesn\'t have it in him\r\nany more. There\'s no more harm in him than a lamp post."\r\n\r\n"Did the lamp posts have hair on them, Miss Teresa? Did they pant and\r\nswell and smell green--"\r\n\r\n"Oh! You couldn\'t know! 

You awful man!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m Agnes," said Agnes; but Teresa dragged Agnes away with her.\r\n\r\n"What is the lamp-post jag, Bascomb?" asked Officer Mossback McCarty.\r\n\r\n"Ah--I know what it is like to be in hell, Mossback. I dreamed of it\r\nlast night."\r\n\r\n"And well you should, a man who neglects his Easter duty year after\r\nyear. But the lamp-post jag? If it concerns anything on my beat, I have\r\nto know about it."\r\n\r\n"It seems that I had the same depressing dream as the young lady,\r\nidentical in every detail."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNot knowing what dreams are (and we do not know) we should not find\r\nit strange that two people might have the same dream. There may not\r\nbe enough of them to go around, and most dreams are forgotten in the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nBascomb Swicegood had forgotten his dismal dream. He could not account\r\nfor his state of depression until he heard Teresa Ananias telling\r\npieces of her own dream to Agnes Schoenapfel. Even then it came back to\r\nhim slowly at first, but afterwards with a rush.\r\n\r\nThe oddity wasn\'t that two people should have the same dream, but that\r\nthey should discover the coincidence, what with the thousands of people\r\nrunning around and most of the dreams forgotten.\r\n\r\nYet, if it were a coincidence, it was a multiplex one. On the night\r\nwhen it was first made manifest it must have been dreamed by quite a\r\nnumber of people in one medium-large city. There was a small piece in\r\nan afternoon paper. One doctor had five different worried patients\r\nwho had had dreams of rats in their stomachs, and hair growing on\r\nthe insides of their mouths. This was the first publication of the\r\nshared-dream phenomenon.\r\n\r\nThe squib did not mention the foul-green-rain background, but later\r\ninvestigation uncovered that this and other details were common to the\r\ndreams.\r\n\r\nBut it was a reporter named Willy Wagoner who really put the town on\r\nthe map. Until he did the job, the incidents and notices had been\r\nisolated. Doctor Herome Judas had been putting together some notes on\r\nthe Green-Rain Syndrome. Doctor Florenz Appian had been working up\r\nhis evidence on the Surex Ventriculus Trauma, and Professor Gideon\r\nGreathouse had come to some learned conclusions on the inner meaning of\r\nwarts. But it was Willy Wagoner who went to the people for it, and then\r\ngave his conclusions back to the people.\r\n\r\nWilly said that he had interviewed a thousand people at random. (He\r\nhadn\'t really; he had talked to about twenty. It takes longer than you\r\nmight think to interview a thousand people.) He reported that slightly\r\nmore than sixty-seven per cent had had a dream of the same repulsive\r\nworld. He reported that more than forty-four per cent had had the dream\r\nmore than once, thirty-two per cent more than twice, twenty-seven per\r\ncent more than three times. Many had had it every damned night. And\r\nmany refused frostily to answer questions on the subject at all.\r\n\r\nThis was ten days after Bascomb Swicegood had heard Teresa Ananias tell\r\nher dream to Agnes.\r\n\r\nWilly published the opinions of the three learned gentlemen above, and\r\nthe theories and comments of many more. He also appended a hatful of\r\nanswers he had received that were sheer levity.\r\n\r\nBut the phenomenon was not local. Wagoner\'s article was the first\r\ncomprehensive (or at least wordy) treatment of it, but only by hours.\r\nSimilar things were in other papers that very afternoon, and the next\r\nday.\r\n\r\nIt was more than a fad. Those who called it a fad fell silent after\r\nthey themselves experienced the dream. The suicide index arose\r\naround the country and the world. The thing was now international.\r\nThe cacophonous ditty _Green Rain_ was on all the jukes, as was _The\r\nWart-Hog Song_. People began to loathe themselves and each other.\r\nWomen feared that they would give birth to monsters. 

There were\r\nnew perversions committed in the name of the thing, and several\r\norgiastic societies were formed with the stomach rat as a symbol. All\r\nentertainment was forgotten, and this was the only topic.\r\n\r\nNervous disorders took a fearful rise as people tried to stay awake\r\nto avoid the abomination, and as they slept in spite of themselves and\r\nsuffered the degradation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is no joke to experience the same loathsome dream all night every\r\nnight. It had actually come to that. _All_ the people were dreaming it\r\n_all_ night _every_ night. It had passed from being a joke to being a\r\nuniversal menace. Even the sudden new millionaires who rushed their\r\ncures to the market were not happy. They also suffered whenever they\r\nslept, and they knew that their cures were not cures.\r\n\r\nThere were large amounts posted for anyone who could cure the populace\r\nof the wart-hog-people dreams. There was presidential edict and\r\ndictator decree, and military teams attacked the thing as a military\r\nproblem, but they were not able to subdue it.\r\n\r\nThen one night a nervous lady heard a voice in her noisome dream.\r\nIt was one of the repulsive cracked wart-hog voices. "You are not\r\ndreaming," said the voice. "This is the real world. But when you wake\r\nyou will be dreaming. That barefaced world is not a world at all. It is\r\nonly a dream. 

This is the real world." The lady awoke howling. And she\r\nhad not howled before, for she was a demure lady.\r\n\r\nNor was she the only one who awoke howling. There were hundreds,\r\nthen thousands, then millions. The voice spoke to all and engendered\r\na doubt. 

Which was the real world? Almost equal time was now spent in\r\neach, for the people had come to need more sleep and most of them had\r\narrived at spending a full twelve hours or more in the nightmarish\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n"It could be" was the title of a headlined article on the subject by\r\nthe same Professor Greathouse mentioned above. It could be, he said,\r\nthat the world on which the green rain fell incessantly was the real\r\nworld. It could be that the wart-hogs were real and the people a dream.\r\nIt could be that rats in the stomach were normal, and other methods of\r\ndigestion were chimerical.\r\n\r\nAnd then a very great man went on the air in worldwide broadcast with a\r\nspeech that was a ringing call for collective sanity. It was the hour\r\nof decision, he said. 

The decision would be made. Things were at an\r\nexact balance, and the balance would be tipped.\r\n\r\n"But we can decide. One way or the other, we _will_ decide. I implore\r\nyou all in the name of sanity that you decide right. One world or the\r\nother will be the world of tomorrow. One of them is real and one of\r\nthem is a dream. Both are with us now, and the favor can go to either.\r\nBut listen to me here: whichever one wins, the other _will have always\r\nbeen_ a dream, a momentary madness soon forgotten. I urge you to the\r\nsanity which in a measure I have lost myself. Yet in our darkened\r\ndilemma I feel that we yet have a choice. Choose!"\r\n\r\nAnd perhaps that was the turning point.\r\n\r\nThe mad dream disappeared as suddenly as it had appeared. The world\r\ncame back to normal with an embarrassed laugh. 

It was all over. It had\r\nlasted from its inception six weeks.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBascomb Swicegood, a morning type, felt excellent this morning. He\r\nbreakfasted at Cahill\'s, and he ordered heavily as always. And he\r\nlistened with half an ear to the conversation of two girls at the table\r\nnext to his.\r\n\r\n"But I should know you," he said.\r\n\r\n"Of course. I\'m Teresa."\r\n\r\n"I\'m Agnes," said Agnes.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Swicegood, how could you forget? It was when the dreams first\r\ncame, and you overheard me telling mine to Agnes. Then you ran after us\r\nin the street because you had had the same dream, and I wanted to have\r\nyou arrested. Weren\'t they horrible dreams? And have they ever found\r\nout what caused them?"\r\n\r\n"They were horrible, and they have not found out. They ascribe it to\r\ngroup mania, which is meaningless. And now there are those who say that\r\nthe dreams never came at all, and soon they will be nearly forgotten.\r\nBut the horror of them! The loneliness!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, we hadn\'t even pediculi to curry our body hair. We almost hadn\'t\r\nany body hair."\r\n\r\nTeresa was an attractive girl. She had a cute trick of popping the\r\nsmallest rat out of her mouth so it could see what was coming into\r\nher stomach. She was bulbous and beautiful. "Like a sackful of skunk\r\ncabbage," Bascomb murmured admiringly in his head, and then flushed\r\ngreen at his forwardness of phrase.\r\n\r\nTeresa had protuberances upon protuberances and warts on warts, and\r\nhair all over her where she wasn\'t warts and bumps. "Like a latrine\r\nmop!" sighed Bascomb with true admiration. The cracked clang of\r\nTeresa\'s voice was music in the early morning.\r\n\r\nAll was right with the earth again. Gone the hideous nightmare world\r\nwhen people had stood barefaced and lonely, without bodily friends\r\nor dependents. Gone that ghastly world of the sick blue sky and the\r\nnear-absence of entrancing odor.\r\n\r\nBascomb attacked manfully his plate of prime carrion. And outside the\r\npungent green rain fell incessantly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK DREAM WORLD ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\xe2\x80\x99s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
