]\r\n\r\n\r\nOld Thak watched fondly as the new telescope was being put into its\r\nplace. He had been a long time persuading the elders to build this\r\ninstrument, a duplicate of the one destroyed in the latest great war.\r\nIt was as fine a telescope as Mars could produce, and only Thak\'s\r\nassurances that the work was of the greatest importance had secured\r\nhim this luxury.\r\n\r\nHis project must succeed, he felt, glancing at his students. Like him,\r\nthey were almost spherical in shape, with fine arm-like appendages\r\nringing their middles. They were young and enthusiastic, and Thak\r\nbelieved they could revive the science of astronomy. He, the last\r\nastronomer of Mars, would teach them all he knew.\r\n\r\nThe overseer of the workers was disgusted. "You waste our resources,\r\nThak," he declared. "You have taken two years of labor by dozens of\r\nworkers, and for what? So that you may look at the sky!"\r\n\r\nThak\'s tentacles purpled, a sign of irritation. "You military men!" 

he\r\nretorted. "It was your kind, Mitfpa, that destroyed our civilization\r\nand reduced our race to a few hungry thousands. You have ruined\r\nprogress and science forever. You have hastened the death of our race.\r\nUnless--"\r\n\r\nHe waved through the open doorway, pointing out the early evening sky.\r\nJust rising over the horizon was a blue body that was of a dazzling\r\nbrilliance, outshining all the other heavenly bodies. Thak\'s voice\r\nbecame emotional.\r\n\r\n"On that planet," he said, "are civilized beings. They hold the only\r\nhope for the salvation of our race. We must work to contact them, as\r\nlong as there is one of us to carry on!

"\r\n\r\n"What is this, Thak?" 

Mitfpa demanded angrily. "How can you say, old\r\none, that people of intelligence live on the blue planet? 

You will tell\r\nme next that you have been there!"\r\n\r\nThe soldier laughed scornfully, but Thak\'s voice was unruffled as he\r\nexplained. "This is no mere fancy of mine. 

These people have been\r\nsignalling to us for some time. And when I signalled back by creating\r\na network of space-warping lines through our entire power system, they\r\nstrengthened their signals. Then came your war--"\r\n\r\n"Space warps?" Mitfpa growled. "More power wasted? 

How was this\r\naccomplished?"\r\n\r\nThe workers were bolting the last legs of the telescope into position,\r\nand the students were making happy squeaks. Thak looked gratefully\r\ntoward his new instrument, and toward the scholars. A fine lot of young\r\nones, these. Perhaps, in them, astronomy would become once more a\r\nscience of great importance. Perhaps they would be the salvation of\r\nMars.\r\n\r\nHe answered Mitfpa\'s questions. "The power used was very small. You\r\nhave heard of controlled space warps?"\r\n\r\n"What about it?" grumbled the soldier.\r\n\r\n"An interesting laboratory trick. But it also occurs in nature.\r\nAs a youth I once saw the light of stars bent around the sun in a\r\nselector-scope; indeed, it was this very phenomenon that showed our\r\nscientists how to make their own warps."\r\n\r\n"Enough of your lecture, old one. What was the result of this\r\nscientific trickery?"\r\n\r\n"One as stupid as you would not understand the method," Thak replied\r\nlevelly, "but the result of warping all of our power beams was a\r\nnetwork of opaque lines that to an observer would be an obvious signal.\r\nAnd now, if you are quite ready to leave--?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGrumbling, Mitfpa departed, taking his soldier-worker with him. Thak\r\nchecked the placement of the telescope, finally nodding in satisfaction\r\nas he found everything in proper order. The four students crowded\r\naround, watching with interest. He gazed good-naturedly at them.\r\n\r\n"Our work is a great one," he declared. "We must communicate with\r\nthe third planet by means of a system of signals that we shall work\r\nout--in time. But there is so little time...." His tentacles curled\r\nthoughtfully about him. "You have followed the work of our last great\r\nphysicist, _Mor_ Gran?"\r\n\r\n"You mean," asked an alert youngster named Rofan, "the probability\r\ntables worked out by him? Showing that the end is near for our race?"\r\n\r\nThak nodded sadly. "Indeed, lad, the future appears dark. War and its\r\ndisorganization must inevitably strangle civilization. Even now our\r\nrace is thinned in numbers, and the beasts of the desert multiply."\r\n\r\n"There," he went on, waving toward the blue planet, "is our only hope.\r\nIf we can effect communication with them, and be guided by their\r\nsuperior wisdom, we may yet rally. They may have some secret--some way\r\nto prevent wars--"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _"There!" Thak said. "There lies our only hope."_]\r\n\r\n"You continue to speak of their superior wisdom, _Mor_ Thak," said\r\nRofan. "How can you be so very sure of that?

"\r\n\r\n"It is obvious, lad. Their signal system consists of spots of light\r\nover the greater part of the land surface of their planet. I have shown\r\nyou the old photographs, taken before the last war, showing these\r\nlights. Even with the small telescope I have been forced to use during\r\nthese lean years, I have watched the lights. What a mighty science\r\ntheirs must be that can make the night time light merely to signal\r\nanother planet! For that can be the only purpose of the lights."\r\n\r\nRofan let his tentacles curl about him as he concentrated. "You must be\r\nright," he finally agreed. "I was going to suggest that they might be\r\nthe lights of cities. I noticed many of them were situated where a city\r\nwould be likely--but there must be millions of beings to populate so\r\nmany cities--"\r\n\r\nOne of the other pupils made a loud amused noise. "Whoever heard of\r\na city without a roof?" he demanded. "Could lights be seen through a\r\nroof?"\r\n\r\nRofan was embarrassed, and he remained very quiet for a while,\r\nwondering how he could have made such a stupid error. Of course lights\r\ncould not be seen through a roof. And who had ever heard of a city\r\nwithout a roof!\r\n\r\nThak, paying no attention to the byplay, focused his lens with great\r\ncare. The students gathered about the concave bowl of white quartz.\r\nThe lights were lowered, and into the bowl moved a blurred sphere. As\r\nThak\'s tentacles moved the lenses closer and closer into focus, the\r\nsphere resolved itself with more and more clarity, until it was a fine\r\nimage of the third planet.\r\n\r\nAwed by the splendor of the sight, the students could only stare. And\r\nindeed it was a breathtaking spectacle, as if they were gathered in the\r\nimmense void of space itself, looking at the planet from a height of\r\nseveral thousand miles.\r\n\r\nThere were five continents in two major land masses, Thak had told\r\nthem. In addition, there were several islands of great size, at last\r\none being practically of continental dimensions, besides a host of\r\nislands large and small which dotted the surface of the planet.\r\n\r\nThe hemisphere on which they gazed was mostly water. The larger land\r\nmass was passing from sight. And half of the smaller mass was presented\r\nto their vision, a double continent that spread almost from pole to\r\npole, with a narrow isthmus joining north and south.\r\n\r\nLike all Martians, they thrilled to a scene of fearful beauty, and they\r\nstood around the quartz bowl for a long time, not speaking, merely\r\nwatching the twin continents come into full view. None noticed old\r\nThak\'s eyes peering desperately at the image of the third planet. 

Nor\r\ndid they see the look of utter despair that grew in his face. They were\r\ntoo intent on the strange scene.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was Rofan who first felt that something was wrong. The novelty was\r\nwearing off, and an elusive thought made him uncomfortable. Something\r\nwas wrong with the picture ... what was it?\r\n\r\nSuddenly he realized. He turned to Thak. "But--the lights, _Mor_ Thak?\r\nThe signals--"\r\n\r\nThak\'s face looked as old as Mars itself as he gazed at his pupil. He\r\nstarted to speak several times before he could manage.\r\n\r\n"We have failed," he said, in heavy tones. "Our signals must have been\r\ntoo weak for the beings of the blue planet to detect. I had hoped--"\r\n\r\nHe arose and looked sadly into the evening sky. "I had hoped I was\r\nwrong. For two years now--our years--I have watched through my\r\nsmall telescope, and the lights have been disappearing, one by one,\r\nsometimes, but more often several at a time. I thought it was the\r\nweakness of my instrument. 

I was wrong. Every light on the blue planet\r\nhas been blacked out..."\r\n\r\nHis voice was a low wail. "_And--the blacking out of those lights means\r\na blackout of life on Mars. A planet-wide blackout...._"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK BLACK-OUT ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
