But poor old Yljm\r\n can never be a mother or a sister--just himself!_\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n_lonesome hearts_\r\n\r\nBy RUSS WINTERBOTHAM\r\n\r\nIllustrated by Kelly Freas\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems unnecessary to say that my story began a long time ago, but I\r\ndo not intend to be subtle. I am not clever and my lying is unpolished,\r\nalmost amateurish. 

So I certainly could not be subtle, which requires\r\nboth cleverness and an ability to tell the truth and a lie in the same\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\nLet us turn back the clock a few ages. I was lying in the sun thinking\r\nof love. I understand that you human beings have an aversion to\r\nbiological discussion, so I will not go into detail. But I must remind\r\nyou that my love life is quite different from yours, for I am from\r\nanother planet. At the time under discussion, I was most deeply in love.\r\n\r\nMy heart\'s desire had no shape, the lovely creature. She had no\r\nintelligence, the divine soul. But she was the greatest bit of\r\nprotoplasm in any galaxy you could name. By our standards, I probably\r\nmight be called handsome. I was young and healthy. I had all of my genes\r\nand chromosomes. My color was the dirty green that is associated with\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nThe sun warmed my body and the tidal undulation of my planet\'s surface\r\nrocked me gently. And then she came into my life. She floated gently in\r\nthe breeze, her dainty figure held aloft by a mere hint of levitation.\r\nSparks of static electricity shot from her tender cilia so brightly that\r\nI was forced to exude a layer of protective fibre to protect my visual\r\nbuds. She sucked a deep breath of cyanic gas into her pulmonary pouch\r\nand spoke to me sweetly with a voice like distant thunder.\r\n\r\n"My dear Yljm, the world is coming to an end."\r\n\r\nI could not believe her, for she had no intelligence. 

She only loved to\r\ntalk. "Perhaps," I said, "but not today."\r\n\r\n"Very soon, then," said she. Her name was Mjly.\r\n\r\nI watched her with patronizing amusement. The static electricity showed\r\nthat she was nervous and upset, but people often get nervous and upset\r\nover trivial matters. "Now, how," I reasoned, "could our world come to\r\nan end? 

The other planet has gone on for thousands of years without\r\ncolliding with us. We circle it, in fact."\r\n\r\n"No," Mjly said, "that is not our doom. Actually our world will not\r\ncease to exist. Life will end here, that is all."\r\n\r\n"Ah," I said. "Our atmosphere is escaping into space." I sucked air,\r\nviciously. True, the air was thin. True, the atmosphere was escaping.\r\nBut there would be breathable amounts for many thousands of centuries\r\nyet to come.\r\n\r\n"Not the air. The food is all gone. Things we eat have ceased to exist."\r\n\r\nI levitated myself and looked out over the throbbing land. A few years\r\nago, this land had been covered with vegetation. I had come to take\r\nvegetation so much for granted that I\'d ceased to notice it. Now it was\r\ngone. There were no round fruits growing from tender grasses, no tubers\r\ndangling from the fungus trees, no legume vines sprawling over the\r\nrocks. Everywhere lay desert, barren dunes shaking their crests with\r\ntidal motion.\r\n\r\nI lowered myself to the ground and dug my big fibrosities into the sod.\r\nNo green leaves grew there beneath the surface. The soil was dead. "This\r\nwill seriously interfere with our future, Mjly," I said.\r\n\r\n"We might eat each other," she replied, "but then there would be no one\r\nleft."\r\n\r\n"No one? 

There are many others here."\r\n\r\n"The others are dying," said Mjly, blinking her otic nerves eerily. "We\r\nsoon will be the only ones left."\r\n\r\nIt was indeed a senseless thing to do, to die just because there was no\r\nmeans of going on living. But I must admit that I was tempted for a\r\nmoment. But I hung onto myself, for there was Mjly, and as long as she\r\nlived, there was a reason for me to live too.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not a cheerful prospect," I said, "but I suppose death by\r\nstarvation is the best way out. We will face death as we have lived,\r\ncheerfully and fortuitously."\r\n\r\n"And why should we die, when there is another world so close?" she\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n"Are you suggesting interplanetary flight, my dear?" I was amused again,\r\neven though there was little enough left to be amused at.\r\n\r\nShe crinkled her sense of smell in reply, and I realized I was not being\r\namused at the right time. Anchoring herself by magnetic processes, she\r\nbegan to weave the atmosphere delicately with her taste-bud tendrils.\r\nQuickly she hollowed the air molecules into a reflective mirror, and\r\nbrought it to focus on our neighboring world. I levitated myself into a\r\nposition so that I could look into the mirror.\r\n\r\nThe near planet was quite satisfactory. It was the one you know as the\r\nearth. 

It was young. It was green. Huge fern-like plants grew abundantly\r\non its surface. 

It was full of food. And near.\r\n\r\n"The trip could be made by levitation," Mjly said.\r\n\r\nI hung back. "Animals might live there. We\'d be devoured."\r\n\r\n"I am not afraid," she said.\r\n\r\n"We might not get hungry for a time. Let us linger here awhile. Later\r\nwhen we get desperate, there will be time enough for interplanetary\r\nflight." I hated the thought of stuffing myself full of air enough to\r\nlast for the long trip.\r\n\r\nMjly lowered her visual buds. "I am going to become a mother," she said.\r\n\r\n"Go then, and become a mother. I\'ll stay here till I get hungry and then\r\njoin you.

"\r\n\r\nMjly unflexed her sense of touch and I felt sorry for her. "If I could\r\nbe sure," I said, "that no wild animals live on the earth, I\'d go\r\nsooner."\r\n\r\nShe snapped her sense of balance in happiness. "I will go first," said\r\nshe. "If everything is pleasant and safe, I will return and let you\r\nknow."\r\n\r\nI nodded my otic nerves and off she went.\r\n\r\nAs you human beings are doubtless aware, space levitation is quite\r\ncomplicated, but not beyond accomplishment. Once you are able to reach\r\nthe speed of escape the rest is easy. But Mjly was young and strong and\r\nsoon she had disappeared from sight traveling at a tremendous velocity.\r\nI followed her as long as I could with the telescope and then I lowered\r\nmyself to the tidal crest of a nearby sand dune and lost myself in\r\nmetaphysical thoughts.\r\n\r\nAlmost half a year later I realized that Mjly had been gone longer than\r\nI expected. Either she had been eaten by wild animals on the earth, or\r\nshe had forgotten me.\r\n\r\nI was beginning to get lonesome and in a few more months I would get\r\nhungry. At the thought of enduring two such excruciating pains at a\r\nsingle time, I decided to risk my life. I would travel through space to\r\nthe earth and try to find my beloved.\r\n\r\nAs you may have guessed, the planet on which we had been living is the\r\none you now know as the Moon, and the distance to the earth is\r\ncomparatively small. The sand dunes now have hardened and the tidal sway\r\nof its surface can be felt only slightly. The moon no longer turns on\r\nits axis and it has no sweetly scented cyanide in its atmosphere. It has\r\nno atmosphere of any sort. But it stands now as it did when I left it,\r\nglorious in death. Since I departed, no living thing has trod its soil.\r\n\r\nMy scientific sense instinctively came to the rescue as I approached the\r\nearth. I felt a strong gravity wrenching at my vitals and so instead of\r\ntrying reverse levitation, I spread my processes so that the atmosphere\r\ncaught in the folds of my skin and I came floating gently down to the\r\nground without harm.\r\n\r\nThe earth was much as it had appeared through the molecule telescope. It\r\nwas covered with green vegetation, good, rich, nourishing stuff. And\r\nthere was enough to feed Mjly and me for a million years.\r\n\r\nThere were no animals of any sort. Again I went to my scientific sense\r\nfor the answer. I realized that while vegetable life was far advanced,\r\nanimal life had yet to appear. Mjly was the first of this type of life\r\never to set foot on terrestrial soil.\r\n\r\nBut where was she? On the moon, I could often locate her a thousand\r\nmiles away by a simple radio call. Although the earth was much larger\r\nthan the moon, I did not doubt that she was within a thousand miles. So\r\nI generated power and issued a call.\r\n\r\nI waited for the response. It came feebly to my antenna.\r\n\r\nUsing my sense of direction, I pushed through the vegetation in search\r\nof her. I did not levitate, because the feebleness of her call indicated\r\nshe might be hurt and on the ground. Besides, levitation is much more\r\ndifficult on the earth than on the moon.\r\n\r\nThe reply came stronger to my next call and I sensed through seven of my\r\nsenses that she was near. She was on the ground, probably injured, which\r\nexplained why she had not returned as she had promised.\r\n\r\nI came to a patch of wilderness, a great marshy plain. In the middle of\r\nthis swamp was a crater, like those caused by meteors, a deep, ugly scar\r\nin the mud. I shuddered at the thought that my darling Mjly might have\r\nlanded there. Her weaker scientific sense might not have given her the\r\ncue to use her skin as a parachute and she might have made the fatal\r\nmistake of trying to reverse-levitate.\r\n\r\n"Mjly!" I called, speaking aloud now. 

"Mjly! Where are you?"\r\n\r\n"Yljm! I am here!"\r\n\r\nYes, the voice came from the crater. Gliding to its rim, I looked down.\r\nA pool of water lay on the bottom. A greenish scum covered the surface.\r\nThe scum moved with a million tiny wriggles.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Yljm," came Mjly\'s voice. "It is I. But I am no longer one being."\r\nAnd her voice sounded like a million tiny chirps joined together. "I\r\nlanded with such force that I came apart. Now each of my body cells\r\nlives a life of its own. And now and then each cell grows fat and\r\nbecomes two. I am my sisters, I ..."\r\n\r\nLet\'s not be subtle about it. Mjly was a microbe, the beginning of\r\nanimal life on the earth. She lives today, she is and always will be her\r\nsisters, her mothers, herselves and her ancestors. But there are few\r\nancestors, for microbes do not die--just part of themselves die.\r\n\r\nAnd I do not die. For I crept away into a hole in the ground, where I\r\nwill live forever. 

I do not starve, for roots reach me here. But I miss\r\nmy love life with Mjly. I can never be a mother or a sister. I will\r\nalways be me, a lonesome old bem.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           \xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7 THE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _If Worlds of Science Fiction_ July\r\n    1954.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\xe2\x80\x99s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
