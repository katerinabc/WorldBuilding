Dickson\r\n\r\n\r\n     _No conceivable force could penetrate Terri\'s shield. Yet he\r\n      was defenseless._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a nice little party, but a bit obvious. Terri Mac saw through\r\nit before he had taken half a dozen steps into the apartment. A light\r\nflush staining his high cheek-bones. 

"This is ridiculous," he said.\r\n\r\nThe light chatter ceased. Cocktail glasses were set down on various\r\nhandy tables and ledges; and all faces in the room turned toward a man\r\nin his late fifties who sat propped up invalid-wise on pillows in a\r\nchair in a corner of the room.\r\n\r\n"The Comptroller is perspicacious," said the old man, agreeably,\r\nwaving one hand in a casual manner. "On your way, children.

"\r\n\r\nAnd the people present smiled and nodded. Quite as if it were an\r\nordinary leave-taking, they pushed past Terri Mac and filed out the\r\ndoor. Even the blonde, Terri had picked up at the embassy ball and who\r\nhad brought him here, strolled off casually, but in a decidedly less\r\ndrunken fashion than she had exhibited earlier in the evening.\r\n\r\n"Sit down," said the old man. Terri Mac did so, gazing searchingly at\r\nthe skinny frame and white eyebrows in an unsuccessful effort to\r\nconnect him with something in memory. "This is ridiculous," he\r\nrepeated.\r\n\r\n"Really?" The old man smiled benignly. "And why so?"\r\n\r\n"Why--" the situation was so obvious that Terri fumbled--a little at a\r\nloss for words. "Obviously you intend some form of coercion, or else\r\nyou would have come to me along recognized channels. And any thought\r\nof coercion is obviously--well, ridiculous."\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"Why? You senile old fool, don\'t you know that I\'m shielded? Don\'t you\r\nknow all government officials from the fifth class up wear complete\r\npersonal shields that are not only crack-proof but contain all the\r\nnecessary elements to support life independently within the shield\r\nfor more than twenty hours? Don\'t you know that I\'ll be missed in two\r\nhours at the most and tracked down in less than sixty minutes more?\r\nAre you crazy?"\r\n\r\nThe old man chuckled, rubbing dry hands together. He said, "I\'m\r\nshielded too. You can\'t get at me. And now the room\'s shielded. You\r\ncan\'t get out of it."\r\n\r\nTerri stared at him. The initial shock was passing. His own statements\r\nanent the completeness of his protection had brought back confidence,\r\nand his natural coolness was returning. "What do you want?" he asked,\r\neyeing the other narrowly.\r\n\r\n"Pleasure of your company," said the old man. "There are some very\r\nstrong connections between us. Yes, very strong. We must get to know\r\neach other personally."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt occurred to Terri that he had misinterpreted the situation. Relief\r\ncame, mixed with a certain amount of chagrin at the way in which he\r\nallowed himself to show alarm. He had looked ridiculous. He leaned\r\nback in the chair and allowed a note of official hauteur and annoyance\r\nto creep into his voice. "I see," he said. "You want something?"\r\n\r\nThe old man nodded energetically.\r\n\r\n"I do. Indeed I do."\r\n\r\n"And you think you have some kind of a bargaining tool that is useful\r\nbut might not be so if it became known to official channels."\r\n\r\n"Well--" said the old man cautiously.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t waste my time," interrupted Terri, harshly. "I\'m not an\r\nordinary politician. No man who works his way up to the fifth level of\r\nthe government is. I didn\'t get to where I am today by pussy-footing\r\naround and I haven\'t the leisure to spend on people who do. Now _what_\r\ndo you want?

"\r\n\r\nThe other cackled. 

"Now, what do you think?" he said, putting one\r\nfinger to his nose cunningly.\r\n\r\n"You are old," Terri said. "And therefore cautious. Consequently you\r\nwould not risk trying to force something from me, but are almost\r\ncertainly trying to sell me something. Now what do I want? 

Not the\r\nusual things, certainly. Within my position I have all the material\r\nthings a man could want; and within my shield I enjoy complete\r\nimmunity. No one but the Central Bureau, itself, can crack this\r\nshield. And no one but they can prevent the conditioned reflex that\r\nstops my heart if for some reason the shield should be broached. I\r\nhave a hold on every man beneath me that prevents him from knifing me\r\nin the back. There could be only one thing that I want that you could\r\ngive me--" he leaned forward, staring into the deep-pouched eyes--"and\r\nthat is a means of getting at the man above me. Am I right?"\r\n\r\n"No," said the old man.\r\n\r\nTerri stiffened.\r\n\r\n"No?" he echoed in angry incredulity.\r\n\r\nTheir eyes locked. For a long time they held, and at last Terri looked\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThe old man sighed--sipped noisily from a drink on the table beside\r\nhis chair.\r\n\r\n"Wait!" said Terri. To his own surprise, his voice was eager, even a\r\nlittle timorous in its hopefulness. "Wait. I\'ve got it. There will be\r\na test. There always is a test every time a man moves up. His\r\nsuperiors watch him when he doesn\'t suspect it. It will be that way\r\nfor me when I am ready for the fourth level. And you have some kind of\r\nadvance information. You know what the test will be. Maybe you know\r\nthe man who will administer it. You want to sell me this information."\r\n\r\nThe other said nothing.\r\n\r\n"Well," Terri spread his hands openly. "I am interested. I\'ll buy.\r\nWhat do you want. Money? A favor? Protection?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"No?" Terri shouted, starting up from his chair. "What do you mean by\r\nno? Can\'t you say anything but \'no\'?" A rage possessed him. He flung\r\nhimself forward two furious steps to stand threateningly over the aged\r\nfigure. "You doddering idiot! Say what you want, and quickly! My two\r\nhours are nearly up. 

I\'ll be missed. They\'ll be here in a few\r\nminutes--the Bureau Guards. They\'ll crack the room shield. They\'ll\r\nrescue me. And they\'ll take you into custody. To be questioned. To be\r\nexecuted. At my order. 

Do you understand? 

Your life depends on me."\r\n\r\nAfter a little, the old man chuckled again. "Yes," he muttered, in a\r\nhigh-pitched old voice. "That\'s the way it\'ll be."\r\n\r\nTerri stared at him. "You don\'t seem to understand. 

You\'re going to\r\ndie."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes," said the old man, nodding his head indulgently. "I\'ll die.\r\nBut I\'m an old man. I\'d die anyway in a year or so--maybe in a day or\r\nso. But for you--for a young man like you--the up and coming young\r\ngovernmental with everything to lose--" he leered slyly at Terri.\r\n"Your death won\'t be so easy for you to take."\r\n\r\n"I die?" echoed Terri, stupefied. "But I\'m not going to die. They\'re\r\ncoming to _rescue_ me."\r\n\r\n"Oh, are they?" said the old man, ironically.\r\n\r\n"Of course!" said Terri. "Of course, why shouldn\'t they?"\r\n\r\nThe old man winked one faded eye portentously.\r\n\r\n"Fine young man," he said. "Up and coming young man. Brilliant. Never\r\na thought for the people he trampled on the way up the ladder. Dear\r\nme, no.

"\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" said Terri.\r\n\r\nThe old eyes, looking up suddenly, pierced him.\r\n\r\n"Do you remember Kilaren?"\r\n\r\n"K-Kilaren?"\r\n\r\n"Kilaren," recited the old man as if quoting from a newspaper. "The\r\nbeautiful young secretary of a provincial governor whose lecherous and\r\nunnatural pursuit drove her to suicide. So that one day to escape the\r\ngovernor, she jumped or fell from a high window. And the people of the\r\nprovince, who had for a long time heard ugly stories and rumors,\r\nfinally mobbed the office and lynched the governor, hanging him from\r\nthe same window from which the girl had jumped. They said that even\r\nthe fall had not spoiled her beauty, but that was probably false." The\r\nold man\'s words dwindled away into silence.\r\n\r\n"If so what of it?" said Terri. "What\'s that to do with me?

"\r\n\r\n"Why, you were there. You were the governor\'s aide, and when the mob\r\nhad gone home and feeling had slackened off, you stepped into the gap\r\nand seized up the reins of government, handling matters so skillfully\r\nthat you were immediately promoted to an under-post at Government\r\nCity."\r\n\r\n"What of it?"\r\n\r\n"Why it was all your doing," replied the other, in a mildly reproving\r\nvoice, "the rumors, the stories, the mob, even the suicide. Poor\r\nKilaren--a pitiful pawn in your ruthless game to eliminate the\r\ngovernor in your mad dash up the ladder."\r\n\r\n"I never touched her!" cried Terri, his voice cracking. "I swear it."\r\n\r\n"Who said you did? The type of mind that stoops to murder would never\r\nhave gotten you this far. But you were the one who hired her, knowing\r\nthe governor\'s tendencies. You were the one that gave her work that\r\nkept her, night after night, alone with the man. You preyed upon her\r\nfear of losing her job. You threw the sin in her face after she had\r\ncommitted it. You told her what she might have been, and what she was,\r\nand what she would be. You broke her, day after day. In the sterile\r\nprivacy of the office you reviled her, scorned her, brought her to\r\nbelieve that she was what she was not, a creature of filth and\r\ndishonor. You blocked off all avenues of escape but the one that led\r\nthrough one high window. _You killed her!_"\r\n\r\n"No!"\r\n\r\n"Yes!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTerri brought his quivering hands together and clenched them in his\r\nlap. He stared at the old man. "Who are you?"\r\n\r\n"I was a friend of hers. We lived in the same hotel-apartment. She had\r\nno family. I believe you knew that when you hired her."\r\n\r\n"I see," said Terri. He drew a long, deep, shuddering breath, and\r\nleaned back in the chair. "So that\'s the story," he said, his voice\r\nstrengthening, "I might have known it. Blackmail. There are always\r\nfools that want to try blackmail."\r\n\r\n"No," said the old man. "Not Blackmail, Comptroller. I want your\r\nlife."\r\n\r\nTerri laughed shortly, contemptuously. "No knowledge that you have can\r\nthreaten my life."\r\n\r\n"They will come," said the old man, leaning wearily back against his\r\ncushions. "As you said, the Bureau Guards will come; and I think I\r\nshall kill myself when I hear them starting to crack the shield around\r\nthis room. They will come in and find you with a dead man. What will\r\nyou tell them, Terri?"\r\n\r\n"Tell them? Anything I choose. They won\'t question _me_."\r\n\r\n"No. The guards won\'t. But the Bureau will. How can they raise a man\r\nto the fourth level when there is a two-hour mystery in his\r\nbackground? They will want to know what you were doing here."\r\n\r\n"I was kidnapped," said Terri.\r\n\r\n"By whom? Can you prove it? And why?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been held a prisoner here."\r\n\r\n"By a dead man? No, no, Terri. 

The circumstances are suspicious. You\r\nwalk away from the embassy under your own power. You disappear and are\r\nfound in a shielded room with a man who has committed suicide. This\r\nmust be explained, and in the end you will have to tell them the\r\ntruth.

"\r\n\r\n"And what if I do?" said Terri, truculently.\r\n\r\n"But the truth is so fantastic, Terri. So uncheckable. I am dead, and\r\nI am the only one who could have supported your story. These people\r\nwho were here when you came in are common actors. They have no idea\r\nwhy I wanted you decoyed here. These are my rooms. And there is no\r\nobvious connection between me and the dead Kilaren. And perhaps I will\r\ndecide to live just long enough to denounce you as a traitor when they\r\nenter."\r\n\r\nAshen-faced, Terri stared.\r\n\r\n"The Bureau will have to question you. They will clamp a block on your\r\nmind so that you can\'t operate the reflex that stops your heart. And\r\nthey will question you over and over again, because the Bureau cannot\r\nafford to take chances. You will go into a private hell of your own,\r\nTerri Mac. You will tell the story of your own evil to that girl over\r\nand over again, pleading to be believed. And they will not believe\r\nyou. And in the end they will kill you, just to be on the safe side.\r\nBecause, you see, you _might_ have been doing something traitorous in\r\nthese two shielded hours."\r\n\r\nTerri\'s head bobbed limply, like a drunken man\'s. 

He made one last\r\neffort. "Why?" he said. "Why do you do this? Your life. 

For a girl who\r\nwas no connection to you?"\r\n\r\nThe old man folded his hands.\r\n\r\n"I was a little like your governor," he said. "We all have our sins. I\r\nloved Kilaren and the shock of her death wrecked my health." He cocked\r\nhis head suddenly on one side. "Listen," he said.\r\n\r\nFrom beyond the closed door of the room, a high-pitched humming was\r\nbarely audible. It grew in volume, going up the scale. Terri leaped to\r\nhis feet; and for the space of a couple of seconds, he lunged first\r\nthis way then that, like a wild animal beating against its trap. Then,\r\nas if all will had at last gone out of him, he stopped in the middle\r\nof the room and closed his eyes. For a fraction of a moment he stood\r\nthere, before a faint convulsion seized him and he fell.\r\n\r\nWith a faint smile on his face, the old man reached out to a hidden\r\nswitch and cut the shield about the room. Uniformed guards tumbled\r\nthrough the door, to pull up in dismay at the sight of the body on the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry," said the old man, "I must have turned the shield on by\r\nmistake. I was trying to signal someone. 

The Comptroller seems to have\r\nhad a heart attack."\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s No Shield from the Dead, by Gordon Rupert Dickson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK NO SHIELD FROM THE DEAD ***\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\xe2\x80\x99s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
