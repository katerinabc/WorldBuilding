So the question--who would investigate?\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Imagination Stories of Science and Fantasy\r\n                             December 1957\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were five aboard the orbiting wheel in the sky--an American, a\r\nRussian, a Frenchman, an Englishman, an Indian. Their job was to keep\r\nwatch--over each other. The Wheel held enough fission-fusion bombs to\r\nblast all of Earth but the five watchdogs saw to it that those bombs\r\nremained stored, a potential threat and no more to aggressors below.\r\n\r\nAnd then Gregson and Lal discovered the alien spaceship moored outside\r\nSupplementary Airlock One.\r\n\r\nIt looked like no spaceship they had ever set eyes on before. Gregson,\r\nthe American, said, "You see that thing out there?"\r\n\r\nThe Indian, Lal, nodded and rubbed his aquiline nose reflectively. "I\r\nsee it--but what is it?"\r\n\r\n"Spaceship of some kind," said Gregson. "Damndest-looking spaceship\r\nI\'ve ever seen, though. Looks like it\'s moored near the airlock.\r\nWonder if we have visitors?"\r\n\r\nHe peered at the ship. It had little in common with the unstreamlined\r\ndumbbells Earth used for spaceflight; it was slim and tapering, with no\r\nvisible rocket orifices; it was made of some strange iridescent metal\r\nthat glimmered in the moonlight.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s investigate," Gregson said.\r\n\r\n"We should call the others," said Lal. "All five should be on hand.

"\r\n\r\n"You\'re right." Gregson touched his belt-stud, giving the signal that\r\ncalled all five crewmen to hand. They appeared quickly--Lasseux,\r\nBeveridge, Golovunoff. Silently, Gregson pointed through the view-plate\r\nat the newcomer.\r\n\r\nAfter a long look Beveridge shook his head. "That didn\'t come from\r\nEarth," the Englishman said. "Not unless they\'ve developed an entirely\r\nnew drive principle. And look at the design...."\r\n\r\n"That\'s an alien spaceship, all right," Lasseux said.\r\n\r\n"From the stars," added Golovunoff. A cold chill seemed to sweep\r\nthrough the space satellite as he spoke the words.\r\n\r\nQuietly Gregson said, "We\'d better go out there and see what\'s inside.\r\nSince Lal and I saw the ship first, we\'ll be the ones to go look."\r\n\r\n"No," said Golovunoff. "I wish to go also."\r\n\r\n"I\'d rather like to get first look too," said Beveridge.\r\n\r\n"I think we\'d all better go," Lasseux suggested. "The station can\r\noperate without us for a while. 

And we\'ll never agree on who\'s to go,\r\neh?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFive figures in spacesuits clustered about the alien ship. At\r\nclose range its iridescent skin looked other-worldly and vaguely\r\nfrightening, gleaming purple and green and dull-bronze by moonlight. A\r\nquartz window gave a view of the ship\'s interior.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see anyone in there," said Gregson. "You?

"\r\n\r\n"Looks empty to me," commented Beveridge.\r\n\r\n"Empty! Impossible!" said Lasseux vehemently. "Empty spaceships do not\r\npilot themselves across the void to Earth. Empty spaceships do not\r\ncomplicatedly moor themselves outside a space satellite\'s airlock.\r\nEmpty spaceships...."\r\n\r\n"That\'s enough, Lasseux," growled the Russian. "Whether it makes sense\r\nor no, that spaceship\'s empty."\r\n\r\n"Let\'s find the hatch," suggested Lal. "Perhaps there\'s someone injured\r\ninside, out of the line of sight."\r\n\r\nThe five Earthmen covered the surface of the ship, looking for an\r\nexterior hatch control. Beveridge found it first--a narrow lever\r\nextruding a few inches from the skin of the alien vessel. He called\r\nto the others, then yanked down on the lever. The hatch pivoted back,\r\nopening into an airlock.\r\n\r\nThere was the usual moment of Alphonse-Gaston as the five crewmen\r\njockeyed for position, none willing to let any of the others get ahead\r\nof him on anything. Then Lasseux slipped through and into the alien\r\nspaceship, followed by Gregson and Beveridge almost simultaneously, and\r\nthen Golovunoff and Lal.\r\n\r\nThe ship _was_ empty.\r\n\r\nThere was not the slightest sign of life. The five men roamed through\r\nthe vessel, noting the utterly alien control-panel, the strange\r\nfurnishings, the peculiar fixtures and appurtenances. But the ship was\r\nvoid of life.\r\n\r\nFinally they returned to the Wheel and, puzzled, discussed the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n"It makes no sense," objected Lasseux. The small Frenchman was plainly\r\nobsessed with the inconsistency of the thing. "The ship crosses the\r\ninterstellar void ... alone? Can remote control extend so far?"\r\n\r\n"Looks like it did," said Gregson.\r\n\r\n"Impossible!" Lasseux sputtered.\r\n\r\n"In any case," said Beveridge, "we have a prize--a gift from the stars.\r\nAn alien spaceship, free and without strings of any kind. We should\r\nnotify Earth of our find."\r\n\r\n"Do you suppose," said Lal, "that the pilot of that ship may be around\r\nyet?"\r\n\r\n"Huh?" From Gregson and Beveridge at the same time.\r\n\r\n"What I mean is, suppose that pilot is not like you and me--suppose,\r\nthat is, that he is invisible? Perhaps he is still aboard his ship, and\r\nwe passed over him unknowing? 

Or perhaps he has come right in here with\r\nus and listens to our very words?"\r\n\r\nGregson shuddered. "You\'ve got a wild imagination, Lal. But we have\r\nenough problems on our hands without worrying about ghosts from outer\r\nspace."\r\n\r\n"I said not ghosts--"\r\n\r\n"Enough," boomed Golovunoff. "We can continue this silly quarrel\r\nindefinitely. Let us assume, since we see no one and nothing aboard the\r\nship, that it arrived empty. And therefore that it is ours for study."\r\n\r\n"Do empty ships moor themselves to airlock hatches?" asked the\r\nFrenchman sarcastically. "I tell you Lal\'s right--there must have been\r\nintelligence guiding that ship!"\r\n\r\nGregson shook his head. 

"No. 

Listen to me, will you? We built this\r\nsatellite station jointly, as a global watch-station. But does that\r\nmean that everything the satellite discovers is to be shared equally?"\r\n\r\n"Of course," said Beveridge.\r\n\r\n"Then how do we divide that spaceship into five equal parts? Whose\r\ncountry gets it?

"\r\n\r\nThere was a moment\'s silence. Then Lal said, "We\'ll turn it over to\r\nthe United Nations. They can let all nations examine it freely.

"\r\n\r\nFor once there was general agreement. "Good idea," Gregson said\r\napprovingly, and then the five went back to their tasks aboard the\r\nsatellite.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe satellite had been in space less than a year. The development\r\nof spaceflight had put an end to the possibility of war on Earth by\r\nbringing into being a watchdog for the uneasy planet.\r\n\r\nPut a satellite in the sky. Arm it with enough fission-fusion bombs\r\nto blast any country to flinders. Man it with a squad chosen from\r\nthe leading countries of the world and let them keep watch over one\r\nanother. Any threat of aggression on the mother planet could easily be\r\nsquashed by the more potent threat of blazing vengeance from the skies.\r\nThe satellite was the guardian of the world\'s peace.\r\n\r\nThe five men chosen to be the first crew were almost ideal for\r\nthe job--sensitive, intelligent men, skilled in the techniques of\r\nspaceflight, loyal to the countries of their birth. There wouldn\'t be\r\nany chance of collusion among them, of a conspiracy against one country\r\nor against Earth itself, as some feared.\r\n\r\nTheir tasks for the hours immediately after the discovery of the\r\nstrange spaceship were mostly routine; Lal dictated a comprehensive\r\nreport on the spaceship and beamed it to United Nations Headquarters on\r\nEarth, while Beveridge and Golovunoff, spacesuited, filmed the alien\r\nship from every conceivable angle, inside and out. Lasseux and Gregson\r\ntended to the workings of the satellite, overseeing the cybernetic\r\ngovernors which had the actual responsibility of operating the big\r\nwheel in the sky.\r\n\r\nLasseux was cook that night, according to the strict rotation that had\r\nbeen set up. The men ate a strange meal; their spirits seemed oddly\r\ndampened by the spaceship that had so unpredictably come into their\r\nmidst. Lal\'s words preyed on them despite themselves. Suppose there had\r\nbeen an invisible alien aboard that ship? Suppose he lurked aboard the\r\nwheel this very moment?\r\n\r\n"Suppose," said Beveridge suddenly, "that alien ship was an invasion\r\nscout."\r\n\r\n"What\'s that?" Gregson asked.\r\n\r\n"What I mean is, the advance guard of an invasion force. The alien\r\nfinds the satellite and, being telepathic, parks here a while to\r\nsee what\'s going on." He giggled self-consciously. "I\'m speaking\r\nimaginatively, of course. The alien moors here and reads our minds;\r\nfinds out we have a load of bombs here that can blow up the works down\r\nthere. So he comes drifting out of the ship and takes over someone of\r\nus here. When no one else is looking--_poof!_--Earth is destroyed like\r\nthat!" Again Beveridge giggled.\r\n\r\nGregson looked at him sourly. "You better leave those crazy magazines\r\nalone, Beveridge."\r\n\r\nBut Lasseux interjected, "We should devote careful attention to what he\r\nhas said. 

There may be a grain of truth in it. After all, _who moored\r\nthe spaceship_?"\r\n\r\nA moment\'s silence. Then the Russian said, "Assuming one of us is an\r\nalien--not that I believe Beveridge\'s fanciful story--how would we\r\nknow? Until Earth is destroyed, that is?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s just it," said Lal gloomily. "We _wouldn\'t_ know. Not until it\r\nwas too late."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat began as Beveridge\'s dinner-table joke soon became an\r\nearnestly-held belief. Perhaps it was the strain of life aboard the\r\nsatellite, 10,000 miles above the Earth\'s surface. Perhaps the tensions\r\nof a year\'s isolation from the rest of humanity were taking their toll.\r\nBut, from a dinner-table jest, the concept soon became a source of\r\nserious discussion. And tension.\r\n\r\nTension wrapped cold fingers around them as the days passed. They\r\nagreed to operate in teams, never to let one out of another\'s sight,\r\nalways to keep constant watch ... for there was no way of telling which\r\nof them harbored in his body or his mind Earth\'s potential destroyer.\r\n\r\nTwo days passed this way, and a third. Then Lal went for a walk in\r\nspace--without a suit.\r\n\r\n"He cracked," Gregson said, staring at the Indian\'s corpse. "This crazy\r\nalien business--it just broke him apart."\r\n\r\n"Yes," Lasseux said moodily. "The tension ... the looking and\r\nspying ... he couldn\'t take it any more. Our first casualty. 

But not\r\nthe last, I fear."\r\n\r\nBeveridge and Gregson brought Lal\'s body in--it was orbiting around the\r\nWheel--and a brief funeral service was conducted. The Indian\'s body was\r\nfed to the atomic converters that ran the station and consumed in an\r\ninstant\'s blaze of light.\r\n\r\nLasseux radioed Earth and gave them a full account of the tragedy. He\r\nwas told that a replacement for Lal would be on his way within a week\r\nor two.\r\n\r\n"Now there are just four of us," he said, turning from the radio. "It\r\nwill make keeping watch easier. I will team with Golovunoff for the\r\nrest of the day; you two English-speakers can work together."\r\n\r\nThey did. 

It was a cold, cheerless day. The little Indian had\r\neveryone\'s spirits.\r\n\r\nThen Beveridge suggested, "Perhaps Lal was the one carrying the alien.\r\nWhen he discovered the truth he ran out into space, killing himself and\r\nthe alien...?"\r\n\r\n"No," Gregson said. "Why would he wait so long? Lal was the type to do\r\nsuch a thing the moment he found out. Besides, the alien wouldn\'t be\r\nbothered by space if it has no body."\r\n\r\n"Damn; you\'re right. Just trying to cheer things, old man. Just\r\ntrying...."\r\n\r\nSuddenly the sound of a pistol-shot echoed through the chambers of\r\nthe space satellite. The crewmen always carried pistols as safeguards\r\nagainst one another.\r\n\r\n"You hear that?" Gregson said.\r\n\r\nBeveridge nodded.\r\n\r\nMoments later Lasseux came running into the chamber, muttering\r\nexcitedly and incoherently to himself in French. He carried a smoking\r\ngun in his hand. Gregson and Beveridge immediately drew but Lasseux\r\nraised his other hand and dropped the gun.\r\n\r\n"Calm yourself!" Gregson ordered, shaking Lasseux roughly. "Calm down!\r\nWhat happened!"\r\n\r\nThe flow of French finally ceased. Lasseux made a visible effort to\r\nmaster himself and said. "Golovunoff--the Russian--_he_ was the alien!"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Transcriber\'s Note: This paragraph seemed to be a printer\r\nerror. 

A portion was removed for better readability. The original text\r\nof this paragraph was "The flow of French finally ceased. Lasseux made\r\na visible effort added an exotic spark to the group that was missing\r\nnow and the tragic nature of his death dampened to master himself and\r\nsaid. "Golovunoff--the Russian--_he_ was the alien!"]\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"I saw him change shape," Lasseux gasped. "He seemed to waver for a\r\nmoment when he thought I wasn\'t looking. The edges of his body blurred.\r\nIt was awful! Then he saw me--and I shot him!"\r\n\r\n"Is he dead?"\r\n\r\n"Yes! Yes! I sealed off the chamber, so the alien couldn\'t escape if\r\nit\'s still alive." Lasseux was trembling violently. Beveridge and\r\nGregson, pale, stared at him.\r\n\r\n"Two men dead," Gregson said. "And we don\'t know if we\'ve killed the\r\ncreature yet. Or if there really is a creature," he added more silently\r\nto himself.\r\n\r\nThen--"Great God! _Lasseux!_"\r\n\r\nGregson gaped. The Frenchman was ... _wavering_. It was the only way to\r\ndescribe it. He seemed to be blurring and shifting mistily, but only\r\nfor an instant.\r\n\r\nAn instant was long enough. Gregson had his gun out and pumped three\r\nshots into Lasseux\'s body. The Frenchman looked incredulously at him a\r\nmoment, then crumpled.\r\n\r\nGregson took four steps back and let the gun drop from his nerveless\r\nfingers. "It was a trick," he said in a half-whisper. "He killed the\r\nRussian and made up the story about him--but he couldn\'t control his\r\nown wavering! Lucky thing I got him first, wasn\'t it?" He turned to\r\nBeveridge for confirmation, but the Englishman was gazing at him\r\nsternly, coldly, almost angrily.\r\n\r\n"He _was_ wavering, wasn\'t he?" Gregson asked. "You saw it too--that\r\nsort of blurring?" The American knotted his hands tensely. "Well, now\r\nthe alien\'s dead--unless it\'s taken a new host. You don\'t think that\'s\r\npossible, do you, Beveridge? I mean, if you shoot the body it\'s in, can\r\nit hop to the next person like that? Do you think...."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the Englishman. 

"I think so."\r\n\r\nHe was wavering.\r\n\r\nBut _he_ held the gun.\r\n\r\nGregson yelled once and charged madly toward Beveridge. The bullet\r\ncaught him in mid-run and sent him spinning back toward the crumpled\r\ncorpse of Lasseux. Coldly, Beveridge fired twice more, then stopped\r\nwavering.\r\n\r\nTen minutes later, the rain of bombs began to shower down on Earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SATELLITE OF DEATH ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!)

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\xe2\x80\x99s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
