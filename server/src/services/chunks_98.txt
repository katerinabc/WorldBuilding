At least,\r\n    Professor Pettibone thought so--until the twenty years were up._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Say "Hello" for Me_\r\n\r\nBy FRANK W. COGGINS\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was to be _the day_, but of course Professor Pettibone had no way\r\nof knowing it. He arose, as he had been doing for the previous twenty\r\nyears, donned the tattered remnants of his space suit, and went out into\r\nthe open. He stood erect, bronzed, magnificent, faced distant Earth, and\r\nrecited:\r\n\r\n    "Good morning, bright sunshine,\r\n    We\'re glad you are here.\r\n    You make the world happy,\r\n    And bring us good cheer."\r\n\r\nIt was something he had heard as a child and, isolated here on Mars, he\r\nhad remembered it and used it to keep from losing his power of speech.\r\n\r\nThe ritual finished, he walked to the edge of the nearest canal, and\r\ngathered a bushel or so of dried Martian moss. He returned and began\r\npolishing the shiny exterior of the wrecked space ship. It had to really\r\nglitter if it was to be an effective beacon in guiding the rescue ship.\r\n\r\nProfessor Pettibone knew--had known for years--that a ship would come.\r\nIt was just a matter of time, and as the years slipped by, his faith\r\ndiminished not a whit.\r\n\r\nWith his task half completed, he glanced up at the sun and quickened the\r\npolishing. It was a long walk to the place the berry bushes grew, and if\r\nhe arrived too late, the sun would have dried out the night\'s crop of\r\nfragile berries and he would wait until the morrow for nourishment.\r\n\r\nBut on this day, he was fated to arrive at the bush area not at all,\r\nbecause an alien sound from above again drew the Professor\'s eyes from\r\nhis work, and he knew that _the day_ had arrived.\r\n\r\nThe ship was three times as large as any he had ever visualized, and its\r\nfuturistic design told him, sharply, how far he had fallen behind in his\r\ndreaming. He smiled and said, quite calmly, "I daresay I am about to be\r\nrescued."\r\n\r\nAnd he experienced a thrill as the great ship set down and two men\r\nemerged therefrom. A thrill tinged with a guilt-sense, because\r\nemotional experiences were rare in an isolated life and seemed somehow\r\nindecent.\r\n\r\nThe two men held weapons. They advanced upon Professor Pettibone, looked\r\nup into his face, reflected a certain wary hostility. That the hostility\r\nwas tinged with instinctive respect, even awe, made it no less potent.\r\n\r\nOne of them asked, "Fella--man came in ship--sky boat--long time ago.\r\nHim dead? Where?" Appropriate gestures accompanied the words.\r\n\r\nProfessor Pettibone smiled down at the little men and bowed. "You are of\r\ncourse referring to me. I came in the ship. I am Professor Pettibone. 

It\r\nwas nice of you to hunt me up."\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the two Terran spacemen met and locked in startled inquiry.\r\nOne of them voiced the reaction of both when he said, "What the hell--"\r\n\r\n"You no doubt are curious as to the fate of the other members of the\r\nexpedition. They were killed, all save Fletcher, who lasted a week."\r\nProfessor Pettibone waved a hand. "There--in the graveyard."\r\n\r\nBut their eyes remained on the only survivor of that ill-fated first\r\nexpedition. It was hard to accept him as the man they sought, but, faced\r\nwith undeniable similarity between what they expected and what they had\r\nfound, the two spacemen had no alternative.\r\n\r\n"I hope your food supply is ample--and varied," Professor Pettibone\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nThis seemed to bring them out of their bemusement. "Of course,\r\nProfessor. 

Would you care to come aboard?"\r\n\r\nThe other made a try at congenial levity. "You must be pretty hungry\r\nafter twenty years."\r\n\r\n"Really--has it been that long? 

I tried to keep track at first...."\r\n\r\n"We can blast off anytime you say. You\'re probably pretty anxious to get\r\nback.

"\r\n\r\n"Indeed, I am. The changes, in twenty years--must be breathtaking. I\r\nwonder if they\'ll remember me?

"\r\n\r\nA short time later, the Professor said, "It\'s amazing. A ship of this\r\nsize handled by only two men." Then he sat down to a repast laid out by\r\none of the awed spacemen.\r\n\r\nBut, after nibbling a bit of this, a forkful of that, he found that\r\nsatisfaction lay in the anticipation more so than in the eating.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll look around and see what we can find in the way of clothing for\r\nyou, Professor," one of the spacemen said. Then the man\'s bemusement\r\nreturned. His eyes traveled over the magnificent physique before him.\r\nThe perfect giant of a man; the great, Apollo-like head with the calm,\r\nclear eyes; the expression of complete contentment and serenity.\r\n\r\nThe space man said, "Professor--to what do you attribute the changes in\r\nyour body. What is there about this planet--?"\r\n\r\n"I really don\'t know." 

Professor Pettibone looked down his torso with an\r\nimpersonal eye. "I think the greenish skin pigmentation is a result of\r\nmineral-heavy vapors that occur during certain seasons. The growth. 

As\r\nto my body--I really don\'t know."\r\n\r\nBut the two spacemen, though they didn\'t refer to it--were not concerned\r\nwith the body so much as the aura of completeness, the radiation of\r\ncontentment which came from somewhere within.\r\n\r\nAnd it was passing strange that nothing more was said about the\r\nProfessor returning to Earth. No great revelation, suddenly arrived at,\r\nthat he would not go. Rather, they discussed various things, that three\r\ngentlemen, meeting casually, would discuss.\r\n\r\nThen Professor Pettibone arose from his chair and said, "It was kind of\r\nyou to drop off and see me."\r\n\r\nAnd one of the spacemen replied, "A pleasure, sir. A real pleasure\r\nindeed."\r\n\r\nThen the Professor left the ship and watched it lift up on a tail of red\r\nfire and go away. He raised an arm and waved. 

"Say \'hello\' for me," he\r\ncalled. Then he turned away and, from force of habit, he began again to\r\npolish the hull, knowing that he would keep it shining, and be proud of\r\nit, for many years to come.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlmost beyond reach of the planet, one of the spacemen flipped a switch\r\nand put certain sensitive communication mechanisms to work. So\r\nsensitive, they could pick up etheric vibrations far away and make them\r\naudible.\r\n\r\nBut only faintly, came the pleasant voice of a contented man:\r\n\r\n    "Good morning, bright sunshine,\r\n    We\'re glad you are here.\r\n    You make the world ..."\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _If Worlds of Science Fiction_ May\r\n    1953.

Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
