]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe grizzled old space veteran leaned back in his chair and stared up\r\nthrough the transparent dome. In the black sky myriad white specks\r\ngleamed without twinkling, their light unbent by atmosphere or dust.\r\nThe steady pulse of the airmakers kept rhythm with the heartbeats of\r\nthe young men seated in a semi-circle, listening with glistening eyes\r\nto these ancient tales of an Earth they\'d never seen--the home of their\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nThey stared hungrily at the old man\'s face. There was a silvery spot on\r\nthe chin where Venusian fungus had nearly gotten into his bloodstream\r\nand had had to be burned away. Over one eye an eyebrow was gone,\r\nreplaced by scar tissue grown on a planet at the other end of the\r\ngalaxy where the light of enormous fireflies wasn\'t cold, as on ancient\r\nearth, but searing with heat.\r\n\r\n"Imagine," they marveled, "such weak flame in fireflies."\r\n\r\n"Not weak," corrected the old man. "Just different. Those insects on\r\nEarth didn\'t have to fight off intense cold. They had a much thicker\r\natmosphere and were close to the sun. And they didn\'t feed on alcohol."\r\n\r\nThe young men\'s eyes glittered. They were an odd group. Small--most of\r\nthem, none over five feet five inches--and pale, unlike the old man\r\nwho was bulky around the shoulders and had skin virtually leathered by\r\nvarious radiations and temperatures and winds.\r\n\r\nEach day this group waited hungrily for the old man to come and talk to\r\nthem. The stories he told were the breath of life to them. And of all\r\nthe tales of adventures in the far ends of the universe, the one that\r\nwas most repeatedly called for was the story of what had happened to\r\nEarth.\r\n\r\n"Tell us about Earth," said one of them, now, in a low voice.\r\n\r\n"About how great we were?" said the old man. "About what love was like?\r\nAbout homes and children and how a man went to work in the morning at\r\ntasks of his own choosing? Or...."\r\n\r\n"No. About what happened. 

You know. 

At the finish."\r\n\r\nThe old man looked up again. His eyes were dreamy.\r\n\r\n"Earth," he said, softly. "Earth. I\'ve been through the galaxies these\r\nlast forty years and I\'ve seen planets by the thousand. And there never\r\nwas one like Earth."\r\n\r\n"Tell us," they said, each in urgent, differing words, but all with the\r\nsame tortured look. "Tell us about what went wrong."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve told you that a hundred times," he said.\r\n\r\nBut they wanted it again. Like a man who relives an incident to examine\r\neach moment with incredulity, as if in hope that it will fade and not\r\nhave happened, as if in unconscious attempt to move sideways from that\r\npoint into another time stream probability where a different course of\r\naction will be true.\r\n\r\n"All right," said the old man.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first they had heard of the strangers from outer space was when\r\nthe new ultra short-wave frequencies were used. Professor Kennicot of\r\nPalmira University was the first to find how to generate and control\r\nthem. He tried to transform the wavelengths upward to a range either\r\nauditory or visual but for some reason power was lost in the process.\r\n\r\nApparently he gave them a sufficient jolt with extra voltage, however,\r\nbecause they were picked up by the strangers in outer space as a\r\nsignal. The heaviside layer did not stop these wavelengths.\r\n\r\nProfessor Kennicot was startled one day when he heard, or thought he\r\nheard, a soundless voice in his mind. It said:\r\n\r\n"Interesting. We didn\'t know there was life on your planet or in your\r\nsolar system."\r\n\r\nProfessor Kennicot shook his head and looked around. Nobody was in the\r\nlaboratory.\r\n\r\n"Of course," said the voice, "We detected atomic radiations from the\r\narea, but Zeetal thought it might come from your sun. Tell us, please,\r\nare you a Grade Three society?"\r\n\r\n"My God," muttered Professor Kennicot. "I\'m having hallucinations."\r\n\r\n"There seems to be some difficulty establishing telepathic\r\ncommunication," came the puzzled thought. And then, after a pause,\r\n"Could it be we\'re in communication with creatures of zero grade?"\r\n\r\nAnother thought from elsewhere answered, and yet Professor Kennicot,\r\nsomewhat, was tuned in: "Impossible. The signal picked up was very\r\nclose to telepathic frequency."\r\n\r\nIt wasn\'t until two days later that Professor Kennicot discovered that\r\nhe wasn\'t the only one who had experienced the auditory hallucination.\r\nThe entire college was babbling about how Professor Johnson had come\r\nrunning out of the Chemistry Lab, which was two doors away from\r\nPhysics, holding his head and babbling nonsense.\r\n\r\nProfessor Kennicot made a beeline for the hospital and had a quiet\r\ndiscussion with Professor Johnson, a discussion which is now historic.\r\nThey discovered that not only were both their I.Q.s over one hundred\r\nand eighty, but that both of them, sitting together discussing the\r\nmatter, were simultaneously getting new messages which nobody around\r\nthem was receiving.\r\n\r\nIt wasn\'t long after that, of course, that many of the most brilliant\r\nmen on Earth were reporting the same hallucinations, and as news of\r\nit spread it became obvious that not all could be insane in exactly\r\nthe same way with the same thoughts. Excitement and puzzlement ran\r\ntremendously high because, although these intellects of Earth could\r\nreceive telepathic messages, they were not advanced enough to send.\r\nThey only knew what was being messaged to them; and this continued to\r\nbe so until feverishly working physicists pinned down the telepathic\r\nwavelength mechanically. That was when conversations were begun and\r\nthe entire Earth was able to listen in, by translation and regular\r\nbroadcast.\r\n\r\nThe discussions did not go well. The beings from outer space would not\r\nanswer questions. They only asked. The first thing, apparently, that\r\nmade them cautious, was the first official question from Earth.\r\n\r\n"How is it that we understand your thought even though many of our\r\nscientists speak different languages?"\r\n\r\nThe whole world awaited the first answer. 

None came. 

There was a\r\nsilence lasting four hours. Then came a message:\r\n\r\n"Your question indicates you may be a low grade of developed life.\r\nWe shall investigate and fit you into our needs according to your\r\ncapabilities."\r\n\r\nA thrill of horror went around the world. What kind of monsters were\r\nthese? What would they do? The uproar that ensued was full of frantic\r\nmilitary preparations. Bombs were readied in the atomic planes, rockets\r\nwere raised in their cradles adjustable to any orbit. Unfortunately,\r\nnobody thought to conceal this, and some fool had failed to shut\r\noff the telepathic wavelength. One morning the world awoke to a\r\nnon-electrical society in which nothing electrical would work.\r\n\r\n"We have put a field of force around your planet," came the message.\r\n"There must be no violence. Be not afraid. 

We come as friends. We will\r\nappear now and investigate. 

Be calm."\r\n\r\nThe leaders of each nation spoke to their people, and the world waited\r\nin tense silence. One day an enormous sphere appeared and landed. The\r\ncreatures that emerged couldn\'t be clearly discerned because they were\r\nin space-suits which gave them comfortable air-pressures and what was\r\nto them breathable atmosphere. They were four-legged creatures but\r\ncould walk on two, if necessary.\r\n\r\nA delegation of picked dignitaries started to show them our world, our\r\ncustoms, the way we dressed, what we lived in, what we ate. Almost\r\nimmediately the strangers turned and left our world.\r\n\r\nWithin two days Earth was in bondage.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe old space veteran stopped. He looked around at the tense faces.\r\n\r\n"We found out later," he said. 

"It was the banquet they watched on a\r\nfilm which we ran off, that did it. There was a scene where a waiter\r\nbrings in a whole roast pig with an apple in its mouth and then it\'s\r\neaten."\r\n\r\nAll the boys drew a deep horrified breath. The old man nodded heavily.\r\n"Well," he said, "how were we to know these beings from outer space had\r\nevolved from pigs, or creatures very similar?" He sighed, and stood\r\nup. "Well, maybe in fifty years they\'ll feel we\'re advanced enough for\r\nfreedom." He smiled. "I\'ll leave you to your telepathy classes and\r\nconditioning."\r\n\r\nHe moved toward the door and a portion of glass wall slid aside to let\r\nhim through. 

But before he exited he turned and said softly, "Now don\'t\r\nlet it get you, boys. Being exhibited in a zoo isn\'t too bad. Serve\r\nyour time and you\'ll get servant status like me and get out into space."\r\n\r\nHe waved and walked out through the spectators gathered around the\r\nglass cage. They moved aside to let him through, staring at him with\r\nbrilliant brown eyes, their snoutlike noses twitching in sympathy and\r\nkindness, their pig-like faces gentle with the expression a man gives a\r\ntrained dog.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK FROM OUTER SPACE ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
