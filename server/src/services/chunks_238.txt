Lewis_\r\n\r\n                 People do strange things--an example,\r\n              committing suicide for no apparent reason.\r\n              Unless it\'s time for a change of identity!\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Imagination Stories of Science and Fantasy\r\n                              October 1953\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n"Fidwell," I said, "why don\'t you go lose yourself!"\r\n\r\nHe stared at me uncomprehendingly for a full three seconds. Then a\r\nglimmer of understanding leaped into his beady little eyes and he got\r\nup from the chair before my desk and started happily toward the outer\r\ndoor of the office.\r\n\r\n"Okay, Mr. Nelson," he said over a thin shoulder. "Just whatever you\r\nsay."\r\n\r\n"Better still," I amended, tapping the glass top of my desk with\r\nmanicured nails, "go shoot yourself."\r\n\r\nHe nodded blithely. "Just as you say, T. J. Just as you say." He\r\nalways called me T. J. when he felt that I was giving him a measure of\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n"Wait," I said, as he reached the door. "Do you by any chance own a\r\ngun?"\r\n\r\nHe turned, a frown spreading between his mousy brows. "No," he said,\r\nslowly, "I don\'t." Then he brightened. "But I could purchase one!"\r\n\r\n"Fine," I said, tossing him a bill. "Buy a couple bullets for it, too."\r\n\r\nHe caught the money, smiled, nodded, and left--closing the door softly\r\nand respectfully behind him.\r\n\r\nHumming a merry little tune, I turned to the papers upon my desk. The\r\npartnership contract between James Fidwell and T. J. Nelson. _If one of\r\nthe partners should die from any cause, the other partner would become\r\nsole owner of the Remey Company...._\r\n\r\nThey seemed quite in order. I shuffled them into a neat pile and cut\r\nan intricate little dance step on my way to the files with them. The\r\npartnership was soon to reach a happy culmination.\r\n\r\nSuicide has it all over murder, you know. No silly questions from the\r\npolice. No mess to clean up. No body to get rid of. 

(The relatives\r\nusually take care of all that.) No bother at all, really.\r\n\r\nI skipped back to the desk, flipped up the telephone, and began poking\r\na finger into the little holes in the dial.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Pasquamine?" I chimed, after hearing the faint click at the other\r\nend of the wire.\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"This is T. J.," I said, chummily. "You still own that block of\r\nfloating stock in the Remey Company, don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Fine! Fine!" 

I complimented. "Bring it over to my office as soon as\r\npossible. And, by the way," I added, casually, "have it transferred to\r\nmy name, you know."\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nHe was in my office in less than an hour, his fat hulk sweating and\r\npanting in the chair before my desk, the heavy lids drooping over his\r\nblack eyes. The stocks were piled neatly before me. 

I thumbed through\r\nthem. 

They seemed to be quite in order. I skipped across the room to\r\nthe files with them.\r\n\r\n"Pasquamine," I said, returning to my desk and handing him a cheap\r\ncigar, "do you by chance own a gun?"\r\n\r\nHe shook his fat head. 

"No."\r\n\r\n"Do you have at home, perchance, a rope?" I glanced at his obese body.\r\n"A good stout one?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"A knife, perhaps? 

A good sharp one?"\r\n\r\nHis oily face beamed quickly. "Ah, Mr. Nelson! That I have! Sharp for\r\nthe salami!" He kissed his thick fingers and made a flipping motion\r\ninto the air with them. "Sharp for the good big salami!"\r\n\r\n"Excellent!" I nodded quick approbation. "Go home and cut your throat\r\nwith it."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe pushed his hulk up from the chair and walked toward the door.\r\n\r\n"And don\'t bother about coming back to the office afterwards," I\r\nadmonished.\r\n\r\nHe paused, hand on the knob, and turned. Then his round face lighted\r\nup. 

"Ah, Mr. Nelson!" he chuckled. "You make with the joke!"\r\n\r\n"Sure." I smiled. "And now you go home and make with the knife."\r\n\r\nThat was the last time I saw Pasquamine. Except at the funeral, of\r\ncourse. He made a lovely corpse--considering everything.\r\n\r\nIt was the day following the funeral when there came a gentle tapping\r\nat my office door.\r\n\r\n"Come in," I said, tossing the half-finished bottle of gin back into\r\nthe lower drawer.\r\n\r\nThey didn\'t bother about opening the door; they just crawled under it.\r\nA moment later, they had slithered across the floor, had wiggled their\r\nway up to the top on my desk, and had flattened out upon its polished\r\nsurface in complete pseudopod relaxation. Gyf and Gyl. My two very good\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n"Sorry, boys," I said, after we had exchanged the usual amenities,\r\n"that I had to get rid of your symbiotics in such a messy fashion. But\r\nbusiness is business, you know; and I felt that the time was right...."\r\n\r\nGyf shrugged gelatinously. "I was getting tired of occupying Fidwell,\r\nanyway," he vibrated. "Regular old pussyfoot. Never had no fun."\r\n\r\nGyl burped resoundingly in the middle. "I hope the next body I get\r\ndoesn\'t turn out to be another wine-guzzling, garlic eater." A tremor\r\nran through him. 

"It upsets me frightfully."\r\n\r\n"Time and the rising tide of accidents will tell," I soothed.\r\n\r\n"I\'m cold," trembled Gyf, "since I ain\'t got no body to keep me warm."\r\n\r\n"You might try my secretary," I offered, playfully. "There\'s a body for\r\nyou!"\r\n\r\n"You know I can\'t," he vibrated. "She ain\'t even dead yet!"\r\n\r\n"Nearest thing to it," I commented, "this side of the precinct morgue."\r\n\r\nThat brought a shake of mirth from Gyl who really has a truly\r\nremarkable sense of humor.\r\n\r\nGyf, ignoring the levity, slid over to the little intercom box at one\r\nside of the desk, crawled in through one of the slits, curled up, and\r\npromptly went to sleep. It seems that Fidwell, along with his other\r\nfaults, had also been a sufferer of insomnia.\r\n\r\n"I suppose," I said to Gyl, conversationally, "you\'ll be wanting a new\r\nbody now...."\r\n\r\n"Not necessarily. Not right away." 

He edged away from the blotter\r\nmy desk fan was blowing in his direction. "Want to wait--" A burp\r\nnearly flipped him again. "--until these garlic fumes effervesce more\r\ncompletely from my system."\r\n\r\n"It worked out wonderfully well, though," I said, "even though you\r\ndid have to put up with the garlic for awhile." I brought out the gin\r\nbottle from the lower drawer. "It was certainly fortunate that Gyf\r\nwas on hand to occupy Fidwell just after his wife murdered him." I\r\nunstoppered the bottle and raised it to my lips. "To Fidwell, departed\r\npartner and erstwhile owner of the Remey Company!"\r\n\r\n"And the joke was on Mrs. Fidwell," sparkled Gyl\'s sense of humor.\r\n"Just imagine: seeing her husband up walking around, hale and hearty,\r\njust a half hour after she had throttled the life out of him with her\r\nown two hands!"\r\n\r\n"No wonder she had to be locked up," I chuckled, pouring a few drops of\r\ngin on the polished glass near my companion.\r\n\r\n"My getting the body of Pasquamine, owner of the floating stock, wasn\'t\r\nso bad either," he reminded me, isolating a drop of gin and flowing\r\naround it.\r\n\r\nI admitted the fact.\r\n\r\n"He nearly crushed me, too, when he tumbled," Gyl reminded. "I\'d been\r\nfollowing him two weeks, waiting for his fat heart to do a flopperoo."\r\n\r\nWe both laughed. I took another drink, and Gyl osmosed a nip.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFinally, I leaned across the desk. "Listen, Gyl," I said, coldly\r\nserious. "Now that this little deal is over, how would you like to get\r\nin on something else? Something really _big_?

"\r\n\r\nHe instantly became all ears. 

(Naturally, only a pseudopod can do it.)\r\n\r\n"After I sell out Remey," I continued, "we\'ll have ample funds. So-o,\r\nif we moved over to Washington, D. C.... If you and Gyf could get in\r\ntouch with a couple tottering congressmen who are about ready to depart\r\nfrom this vale of tears...."\r\n\r\nGyl caught on immediately. "T. J.," he complimented, "you\'ve _got_\r\nsomething!"\r\n\r\nHe fell silent, and I knew he was letting the gin and the thought\r\ntrickle through him, savoring both from various angles. Then he\r\nvibrated, dreamily, "I\'ve always wanted to be a congressman. Or--or\r\na cabinet member. Or--" His vibration dropped to little more than a\r\nwhisper, "--or a _president_!"\r\n\r\n"Sorry," I said, "but I believe he is already possessed."\r\n\r\nGyl flowed around another drop of gin. "Oh, well," he said dismissing\r\nthe ambition, "guess he doesn\'t have much to say about things, anyway."\r\nThen he brightened. "But there are some mighty fine bureaus and\r\ndepartments there. We could wiggle our way into one of those. A few\r\nmillion dollars here and there wouldn\'t be missed."\r\n\r\n"Atta boy! I\'ll take you and Gyf over to Washington in the morning,\r\nthen I\'ll come back here and dispose of the business while the two of\r\nyou are getting established." It sounded like a good idea. Within a few\r\nyears we\'d be rolling in the filthy stuff.\r\n\r\nI poured a few more drops of gin on the glass top, then raised the\r\nbottle. "Here\'s to happy days in the Pentagon!" I toasted.\r\n\r\nOur spirits were soon soaring to great heights, and, as usual under\r\nsuch circumstances, Gyl began talking about the "good old days" when\r\nyou could pick up a likely corpse almost anywhere, anytime.\r\n\r\n"Used to be so much simpler then," he commented, flowing around one\r\nof the fresh drops. "Now you have to beat the embalmer!" He chuckled.\r\n"Fairly close race at times, too! But it keeps one on one\'s pseudotoes,\r\nso to speak!" A combined burp and hiccough nearly flopped him off the\r\ndesk.\r\n\r\nAfter he had regained his equilibrium we spent an enjoyable\r\nhalf-hour talking of cadavers, funeral homes, the comparative merits\r\nof inhabiting youthful or wealthy bodies, and other delightfully\r\nstimulating subjects. Then we began to sing songs, old and new.\r\n\r\nWe had finished the chorus of "We Have All the Dough of Remey" for the\r\nthird time and were just getting warmed up on an extemporization of\r\n"We\'ll Carry On in the Pentagon" when the office door flew suddenly\r\nopen and two Federal boys stepped in, followed by my stupid-looking\r\nsecretary.\r\n\r\nThey came quickly to the desk. One of them grabbed a handful of Gyl\r\nwith one hand and pointed a gun at me with the other. "Just stay as you\r\nare," the officer cautioned.\r\n\r\nMy dumb secretary stared at me with round, innocent eyes. "I couldn\'t\r\nhelp hearing everything you said, Mr. 

Nelson," she chirped, half\r\napologetically. "Your intercom box was open. Must be a short in it\r\nsomewhere. Or a loose connection...."\r\n\r\nThe other officer picked up the little box and shook it. A surprised\r\nGyf felt out from between the slats....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey have Gyf and Gyl in a little bottle now, tightly stoppered and\r\nready for shipment back home to Venus. They\'ll be placed on the next\r\nspace ship heading out.\r\n\r\nThere is a stupid Terrestrial law, you know, which makes it mandatory\r\nthat all Venusians be apprehended on sight or extracted from any body\r\nthey may be occupying and sent back to Venus in all possible haste.\r\n\r\nAnd so I shall soon be extracted from the body of T. J. Nelson and his\r\nneck will bend double in the middle again just the way it was when I\r\nfound him shortly after his accident. Then, in a little bottle of my\r\nown, I shall accompany Gyf and Gyl homeward.\r\n\r\nBut, don\'t worry, I\'ll be back! I\'ll be back just as soon as I can\r\nhitch a ride on a returning spaceboat!\r\n\r\nSo take good care of yourself, my friend, and don\'t catch pneumonia or\r\nstep in front of a truck or anything like that--_until I return_.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK HOLD ONTO YOUR BODY! ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\xe2\x80\x99s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
