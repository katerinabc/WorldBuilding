]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was three in the afternoon and quitting time at Utopian Appliances,\r\nInc. Bertram J. Bernard, the firm\'s stocky, thick-jawed president,\r\nwaited discreetly at his desk for a few minutes, then closed the file\r\nhe had been studying, bid his secretary a pleasant evening, and strode\r\ncalmly out of the office.\r\n\r\nHe did not want to appear eager, and succeeded superbly in that.\r\nJoining several junior executives, he conversed genially with them\r\nas they descended to the rapid-transit floor. Three of the bright,\r\nconfident young men decided to stop for a quick one at the building\'s\r\nplush saloon. Well, that was okay--Bernard had been a late-runner in\r\nhis youth. But now, well into middle age, he had learned that life had\r\nother demands and pleasures.\r\n\r\n"Have a good run, B. B.," said Watkins, the treasurer, at the rap-tran\r\ngate. "Gloria\'s coming in on the three-thirty and we\'re going to dinner\r\nand then some musical or other she\'s been dying to see."\r\n\r\nSo Bernard entered the rap-tran alone, though surrounded by scores of\r\npushing, jabbering strangers. Finding a seat on the aisle, next to a\r\nelectronics company vice-president whom he knew slightly, he engaged\r\nin trade conversation during the five minutes it took the monorail to\r\nreach his stop. He and the electronics executive got off, as did about\r\nhalf of the rap-trans passengers, mostly middle-aged men like himself.\r\nEarly-runners.\r\n\r\nThe escalator from the monorail stop descended directly into the\r\nJungle Station beneath. In the large lobby the crowd dispersed and\r\nBernard was again alone when he reached the dressing rooms. This was\r\nnot surprising, he reflected; not many members of his Jungle Station\r\ncould afford the elaborate private locker unique to this wing of the\r\nbuilding. He pressed his thumbprint to the lock and the door slid back.\r\n\r\nInside, he undressed completely, noting with critical satisfaction the\r\nstrength and color of his body in the full-length mirror at one end of\r\nthe locker. He quickly packed his clothes, shoes, and briefcase into a\r\nsmall suitcase, with delivery instructions on the top. Then he climbed\r\ninto his jungle suit--knee-length shorts, sweat shirt, rubber-soled\r\nshoes, and hip holster.\r\n\r\nHe checked the frequency setting on the sonic pistol, adjusting it to\r\nthe panthers who were reported in ascendancy. As a last thought, merely\r\na whim, he glanced down at the station emblem on his sweat shirt, just\r\nto enjoy the sense of pride he derived from the large red "U-F" above\r\nit.\r\n\r\nOf course there were getting to be more and more ulcer-frees these\r\ndays, but that did not make it any less a matter for pride. And anyway\r\nseveral factions were pressing determinedly for a neurosis-free\r\ninsignia. 

Though there were complications there. Oh, well, the\r\nimportant thing\'s the run, he remembered.\r\n\r\nIn the lobby again he deposited his suitcase at the delivery window.\r\nThen he stopped at the bulletin board to read the ascendancy ratings\r\nfor the day. These were official, therefore several days outdated, but\r\none could extrapolate. Panthers were dropping into third position,\r\nbehind polar bears, with giraffes at the top by a good margin.\r\n\r\nOutside the building he ran into a tipster and decided he had best buy\r\na dope sheet. He gave the seedy little man a dollar bill and looked\r\nover the page.\r\n\r\n"Keep it right where you got it, Mac," the man whispered hoarsely,\r\nnodding toward the pistol at Bernard\'s side. "I got it straight, dem\r\npant\'ers is all over de place. 

Watch out at de water hole, specially."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGlancing swiftly over the page, Bernard saw that fifty panthers had\r\nentered this sector of the jungle overnight, with a herd of fifteen\r\ngiraffes headed well toward the south. But he also noted that there\r\nhad been three deaths from polar bears in the past week in his sector\r\nalone. Fortunately, the frequency readjustment from panthers to polar\r\nbears was an easy one, three clicks clockwise with the thumb. He would\r\nhave to remember about the water hole, though it was either that or\r\ngoing above the rapids. The sharks below the rapids were pretty thick\r\nduring the summer.\r\n\r\n"Thanks, bud," he told the tipster. Then he strode, still calm, to\r\nthe wall. Expertly he clambered up its handholds, till he reached the\r\ntop, thirty feet from the ground. On the other side lay the jungle,\r\nits lush tropical growth hiding from his alert eyes the danger that\r\nlurked within. He popped a Verve pill into his mouth and chewed on it\r\nthoughtfully.\r\n\r\nFar in the distance, some five miles at the narrowest point, rose the\r\nouter wall. Between the two prowled a variety of ambivalent robot\r\nbeasts, now ready to dismember him, but on weekends adjusted to\r\ntake small boys and girls for short rides or simply to stalk about\r\npicturesquely.\r\n\r\nDrawing his pistol and placing it between his teeth, Bernard leaped to\r\nthe ground between the wall and a large low palm. At once the pistol\r\nwas again in his hand. 

But nothing moved. Now he could see clearly the\r\npath he must take.\r\n\r\nBending low, he trotted along through the undergrowth. It soon began\r\nto clear, and still no danger in sight. He holstered the pistol and\r\nadvanced, half-walking, half-running, till he could hear the hiss of\r\nthe rapids. Enough noise to mask the sounds of a dozen panthers, he\r\nthought. But it covered his own footsteps, too, and panthers were more\r\nphonotropic than polar bears, the latter having a preference for radar\r\nspotting.\r\n\r\nCoyotes were the worst, of course, with their damned infrared\r\nthermo-sensors. They could spot a runner even when he was in cover.\r\nFortunately they were scarce and getting more so. Bernard had only\r\nencountered a coyote twice, deactivating it both times. But he had been\r\nlucky. He recalled the story about that city councilman....\r\n\r\nAn hour later he arrived at the river, a half-mile above the rapids\r\nand well away from the water hole. He had seen only one beast in the\r\nfirst three miles of his trek, a giraffe hobbling along in olfactory\r\npursuit of another runner far to the right. Giraffes were mainly a\r\nnuisance, though they could kick and trample a man. Bernard had heard\r\nof such a thing happening, but it was a rarity. They were too easy to\r\nelude.\r\n\r\nHe crossed the river on a log raft he found, which had evidently been\r\nrigged to dump him in about halfway across. At least he had got that\r\nfar on it he told himself, as he struck out for the shore. For one\r\nhorrible moment he thought he detected a shark upstream, but it was\r\nmerely the shadow of a large palm leaf. He had a strong and sensible\r\nfear of sharks.\r\n\r\nA mile farther found him crawling over the rocky ground as the growls\r\nof panthers reached his acute ears from behind a ridge of brush. If\r\nthey heard him, they ignored him, perhaps more interested in other\r\nquarry. His knees and arms were scraped but not bleeding, and at last\r\nhe was able to get to his feet to make better time.\r\n\r\nIt was then that he heard the girl\'s scream.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNo regulation in the rule book discriminated against women becoming\r\nrunners, but only a few of the millions who worked at offices and\r\nplants in the city did so. Also there was nothing in the code about\r\nhelping other runners. Each was entirely on his own, free to help or\r\nbe helped, or not helped, if he chose.\r\n\r\nBernard would never have called for help for himself. But the sound of\r\nthe woman\'s cry appealed to another side of his nature. 

He changed his\r\ndirection, but moved with great caution now. Soon he saw her, and froze.\r\n\r\nShe was clad as he, different sector emblem, but the same proudly borne\r\n"U-F" on her sweater. Her face and body were young and attractive, but\r\nher long dark hair was tangled and wet, and her limbs mud-spattered.\r\nShe had screamed only once, and now her small lipsticked mouth hung\r\nopen with terror.\r\n\r\nBacked against a tree, she gaped in horror, waiting, as three panthers\r\napproached from as many directions. Her sonic lay on the ground outside\r\nthe circle. It was obvious that she was finished if Bernard did not\r\nassist her.\r\n\r\nRaising his hand till the pistol sight was where he wanted it, he\r\nmodified the angle adjustment till all of the animals were within\r\nits range. Then he depressed the trigger several times. Two fell and\r\nthe third animal leaped at the girl. But she twisted around the tree\r\nand Bernard picked off the panther as it readied itself for a second\r\nspring. At once the girl dived for her pistol. Proper response, Bernard\r\nthought approvingly. Then she ran toward him and threw herself against\r\nhim, breathing deeply in that position for several moments.\r\n\r\nBernard felt strongly the strength and zest of youth as he held the\r\ngirl in his arms. Then they turned and walked together to the outer\r\nwall, which was less than half a mile away. There was no danger from\r\nthe deactivated panthers, which would remain out of commission for half\r\nan hour. So they had no reason to hurry.\r\n\r\nBernard helped her climb the wall, though she seemed quite adept at it\r\nherself. On the other side they emerged upon the street. Across the\r\nstreet lay the acres and acres of homes which were the city\'s eastern\r\nsuburbia.\r\n\r\n"Oh, it was just horrible!" the girl finally cried. "All at once they\r\nsprang. 

From nowhere. I tripped and my sonic fell out of the holster.\r\nI\'d be _dead_ if it weren\'t for you!"\r\n\r\n"Very true," Bernard agreed. "You\'ll be more careful in the future, I\r\nhope."\r\n\r\n"If only I could thank you in some way. I owe you so much. My apartment\r\nis just up the next street. Only a few blocks. Wouldn\'t you like to\r\nstop in for a drink? I\'m sure you\'re as tired as I."\r\n\r\nBut Bernard declined. He walked her home, then continued on, unaware of\r\nthe envious glances of young children as he passed. Unaware of other\r\nrunners, early-runners, middle-aged men like himself, also walking the\r\nstreets, wearily but not stooping, not frowning.\r\n\r\nHow good a warm shower would be, thought Bernard, as he entered the\r\nlast mile. His wife would probably want a drink, so there would be that\r\ntoo. 

And dinner. He was _hungry_.\r\n\r\nUlcer-free and happy, he walked the last mile in contentment. The\r\noffice was something that had happened long ago, would happen again\r\ntomorrow, but could never invade his thoughts that night. And he knew\r\nexactly how his wife would greet him at the door.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Hello, darling. How was the run?" she asked, kissing him as he came\r\ninto the house. "You only made fair time this evening. 

Something\r\nhappen?

"\r\n\r\n"No, pretty routine. Panthers are on the increase. I came across\r\nthree of them attacking a girl runner. Works as a copy writer in the\r\ncity. She claims that the jungle cured her ulcers completely. Really\r\nremarkable.

"\r\n\r\n"Mmm-hmm," said Virginia, taking his holster. "Attractive, no doubt. I\r\nsuppose she tried to seduce you. I\'ve heard stories about those jungle\r\nwomen."\r\n\r\n"Nothing of the sort. Just suggested I drop in for a drink. 

After all,\r\nshe was grateful."\r\n\r\nWhat nonsense, he told himself as he showered, Virginia suggesting that\r\nthe girl had intended to seduce him. Oh, well, what difference did it\r\nmake?\r\n\r\nMan, that hot water felt good! Even on his scratched legs and arms.\r\n\r\nHow many years had he been making the run now? Twenty-three, almost. In\r\na way he could consider himself a sort of a pioneer. And to think that\r\nthe only reason he had started jungle running in the first place was to\r\nplease a supervisor! Those days everyone did it.\r\n\r\nAs he dried himself off, hearing the tinkle of cocktails in the living\r\nroom, he wondered if the panthers would move south, away from the water\r\nhole, before tomorrow\'s run.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK WHEN DAY IS DONE ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\xe2\x80\x99s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
