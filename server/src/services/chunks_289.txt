She stayed up for the better part of\r\nthe night, hoping that he would come back. She could not bring herself\r\nto believe that he would really walk out on her and leave her available\r\nfor confiscation, or for the slavery pool. She also thought for quite a\r\nwhile about the possibility of somehow getting back to Earth, where she\r\nwould not be available for either.\r\n\r\nShe even went to the fantastic expense of televiewing there to talk\r\nwith her father and mother. They had been shocked and unfriendly. They\r\nhad said good-by with a finality which left little room for doubt as\r\nto what they thought of an Abandoned. They had never had one in their\r\nfamily, they had pointed out, neither of them, and they did not intend\r\nto have one in their family now. They had warned her that they intended\r\nto report the call to the Beta III Protection People.\r\n\r\nThis did not worry her much. The call almost certainly had been\r\nmonitored anyway. If they wanted to go to the considerable extra\r\nexpense of reporting it, in order to impress the Protection People with\r\ntheir loyalty, that was their own lookout. She understood that, now,\r\nshe had no family. She thought for a moment of going up-ramp to say\r\ngood-by to the children, but she knew that this would not help.\r\n\r\nBesides, it was illegal. They were no longer hers. She was an Abandoned.\r\n\r\nShe had never known what a tremendously harrowing experience\r\nfilling out an availability form could be. Name, age, Sector, race,\r\nsize-classification, beauty-index, fertility tests, personality scores,\r\naptitudes, psyche-rating and so on, and so on and so on. It was like\r\nundressing for an auction. The protection-request form was much\r\nsimpler, except for that one question: STATUS? Her hand shook almost\r\nuncontrollably as she wrote. _Abandoned._\r\n\r\nAfter that she did not know what to do. She had stood for nearly twenty\r\nminutes before the document file, listening, thinking desperately that\r\nhe would come back; that if she only waited a few minutes more he would\r\ncome back. She had made herself refreshment. She had sat with the\r\nfilled-out documents on her lap looking, from time to time, longingly\r\nat the entrance-ramp. But he had not come back. Finally, with a low\r\nmoaning sound, she had pushed the papers through the document file\r\nslot. She made the deadline by a scant three minutes.\r\n\r\nNow she knew that whatever else happened, the Protection People would\r\nbe there in the morning to pick up the children. She knew that it could\r\nshow in her favor if she were to get together the things they would\r\nneed to take with them. She could do this without seeing them and\r\nwithout talking to them, which was forbidden, but she could not bring\r\nherself to move.\r\n\r\nThe red light on the atmosphere control blinked warningly. Soon it\r\nwould let out a piercing scream. She was tempted to just let it.\r\nAnother of Clytia\'s suns must have set. She found that she had no sense\r\nof time. She had only the conviction that this would be her last night.\r\nThe last night that mattered to her at all. She wanted it to be a long\r\none. She had adjusted the atmoset. She had done this every night for\r\nthe seven years of their marriage. She began to sob uncontrollably. She\r\ntook her Status Married card and tore it in half. Then she held the\r\nhalves to her cheeks, her face wet and wretched between them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter a while she dialed the credit balance at her account. The figures\r\ncame back indicating a balance of 1300. He had left her quite a lot,\r\nwhen you considered that she had televiewed to Earth. She cried hard\r\nagain because she knew that he had not had to leave her anything at\r\nall. This made her certain (although she had known it already) that he\r\nwas not coming back.\r\n\r\nShe sat for quite a while studying the 1300 credit indicator.\r\nShe thought about using the money to buy a "pick-up-immediately\r\nadvertisement" on the omnivision. She was not sure of the rates, but\r\nshe thought the amount might even stretch to include a picture of\r\nher. 

She did not know. She did not even know if she would be expected\r\nto be nude or dressed for the picture. In the end, she decided not to\r\ntry an advertisement because there would not be time enough to employ\r\na reply-receiving address. All that would be accomplished would be to\r\nput every predator within miles in possession of the address of an\r\nAbandoned.\r\n\r\nShe took a dictator and said into it: "Dear children, I am leaving you\r\n1300 credit." She stopped then and shook her head. 

The tears made it\r\nso that she could not see, and she did not seem to be able to think.\r\n"Correction," she sobbed "Erase preceding. Dear Children of Yan, I make\r\nyou this gift of 1300. I am sure that your excellence will continue to\r\ndeserve much more than so small a gift. I send love with this small\r\ngift."\r\n\r\nThere could, of course, be no signature. An Abandoned had none.\r\n\r\nShe wished that she had not made the Earth call. There would have been\r\nmuch more to leave them then. He had left an astonishing amount in her\r\naccount. It was almost as though he had expected her to try to get\r\naway. She wished now that she had thought before taking action. There\r\nmight have been some way out.\r\n\r\nShe must have fallen asleep. The morning announcements came on as\r\nusual, waking her. She listened to the instructions for that day, and\r\nthe areas announced as forbidden. She made no effort, however, to\r\nindicate them on the day-map. She knew that, now, none of this applied\r\nto her.\r\n\r\nWith a very great effort she got up and shut off the children\'s ramp,\r\nso that they could not come down. She knew how much this would count in\r\nher favor. Then she began, as hurriedly as she could, to collect the\r\nthings they would need. She knew that she could not possibly get the\r\nthings together in time, and that so late an effort was more likely\r\nto count against her. She was not even close to finished when the\r\nannouncer flashed on.\r\n\r\nWithout asking who it was, she pressed the admitter. She was glad that\r\nthey had troubled to announce themselves.\r\n\r\nShe offered to go into another room while they removed the children.\r\nThey did not answer. One of them threw a sack over her. After a\r\nmoment, they took it off again and, rather apologetically, asked her\r\nto indicate where the child-ramp control was. She showed them. Their\r\nleader said that perhaps it would be all right for her to go into\r\nanother room if one of them went with her. When she saw the one chosen,\r\nshe put the sack back on herself. They laughed so hard at this that she\r\ndid not hear the children leave.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the children had been taken out, the leader came back and removed\r\nthe sack from around her. He asked if she had applied for protection.\r\nShe showed her card.\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s too bad," he said. "Do you have any refreshment left?"\r\n\r\nShe did not dare to lie to him. She showed him. He helped himself.\r\n\r\n"How about credits?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I gave it all to the ones who were here," she answered carefully. She\r\nfelt quick panic because she remembered that she had not so instructed\r\nher account. She had merely dictated it to the children. If he didn\'t\r\nfind out, though, that would be all right. The dictation was proof\r\nenough. But while she was still in this house, the credits were still\r\nin her control.\r\n\r\n"My credit indicator is here," she said, holding it out. He didn\'t take\r\nit.\r\n\r\n"Thanks for the refreshment," he said, getting up. 

"Make yourself\r\ncomfortable. 

The others will be here shortly."\r\n\r\nShe had nothing to do to make herself ready. She could not take\r\nanything from this house. Sometimes they let you wear what you were\r\nwearing, if it did not look as though you had put on your best things.\r\nThey did not always allow it, but they did sometimes. She remembered\r\nthat she had expressed strong disapproval of that to Yan, when they\r\nwere newly married. Then they both felt the same way about Abandoneds.\r\n\r\nShe indicated to her account how she wanted the 1300 disposed. Then she\r\nwaited. After a while, the Protection People came and led her out of\r\nthe house. They did not touch her or speak to her, they merely formed\r\na square in the center of which she walked. They led her to a records\r\nroom where an interview apparatus prepared a report on her.\r\n\r\n"You have filed availability papers?" it asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said, and gave the file number.\r\n\r\n"This is being checked," the apparatus said. "Have you any claims upon\r\nthe State?"\r\n\r\nShe came very close to mentioning the children. "None," she said in\r\na very small voice. It was difficult to remember that the interview\r\napparatus was not at all sensitive.\r\n\r\n"Have you credits in your possession?" the machine asked.\r\n\r\n"None," she said.\r\n\r\n"You are eligible for exclusion from the slave classification in what\r\nway?" That part of the recording seemed a bit worn. At least she did\r\nnot hear it very well.\r\n\r\n"In no way," she replied.\r\n\r\n"You will wait," said the machine, "until we have a report on the\r\navailability petition which you have filed. Please take a seat."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere were no seats. This was an older machine which they had not\r\nbothered to replace, or even to correct. She stood in horror as the\r\nlong minutes passed.\r\n\r\nHer number was finally called.\r\n\r\n"I am here," she said as the machine hummed, and she gave her number.\r\n\r\n"Your availability petition has been taken up," said the machine. "You\r\nare however to receive twenty-eight demerits for disposing of 6300\r\ncredit after having been abandoned. Do you accept?

"\r\n\r\n"I accept," she said. She was so dizzy that she could hardly stand. The\r\nmachine whirred and produced a reception-area card. She read it, and\r\nwalked as in a daze to the indicated reception area. Yan waited for her\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n"You look terrible," he said as he put his arm around her. "I\'m sorry.\r\nYou made me do this to you. 

I didn\'t want to. 

It\'s all over now, don\'t\r\ncry."\r\n\r\nShe thought that she was going to faint.\r\n\r\n"Thank you for receiving me," she said, according to the formula. "I am\r\nthe Abandoned of Yan, of the Estate...."\r\n\r\n"Stop it!" he said. "I know who you are! Stop it!"\r\n\r\n"Do you have children at your estate?" She asked it as one asks a\r\npolite, social question.\r\n\r\n"They\'ll be there when we get home," he said. "Don\'t do this. 

I didn\'t\r\nknow it would hurt that much. I wouldn\'t have done it if I had. They\'re\r\nyour children again now." He held her shoulders as he looked at her.\r\n\r\n"I came to you with twenty-eight demerits," she said. "Shall I work\r\nthem off before I come to your estate?"\r\n\r\n"Please, stop it!" 

he said. "They were paid when you accepted. I waited\r\nhere all night. No one else could have claimed you. 

Please, come on\r\nhome now?" He handed her a brand-new wife-status card.\r\n\r\n"Thank you," she said. "I shall try to deserve the opportunity which\r\nyou restore to me." He smiled as she recited the formula and took his\r\narm. Yet he did not look as if he felt like smiling.\r\n\r\n"Come home," he said. "Come home now. 

I\'ll not hurt you again." He led\r\nher back to their estate.\r\n\r\nThat night, feeling entirely justified, she abandoned him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Mommy," the children shouted. They ran to her and hugged her. They had\r\nmissed her, and had resented the disturbance in their routine. "Mommy!"\r\nThey danced and shouted, "Mommy! Mommy, Mommy!"\r\n\r\nWhen it was their bed time, he left her alone with them. He said good\r\nnight to them himself, kissed them and squeezed her shoulder. "It\'s\r\ngood to have you home again!" 

he said. His eyes filled with tears and\r\nhe hurried from the room.\r\n\r\n"Tell us a story, Mommy." It was the custom of the household.\r\n\r\nThere were tears in her eyes and her voice trembled a little, but she\r\nsaid in what seemed to them a perfect narrative style:\r\n\r\n"Once upon a time there were two very good and loving children who\r\nfound that it was their duty to denounce their father to the state and\r\nto see him publicly flogged to death. You must listen very carefully to\r\nthis," she said, "both of you.\r\n\r\n"At first, they thought that this was a very sad duty...."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ABANDONED OF YAN ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\xe2\x80\x99s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
