So he\r\n             sat back in his chair and began to question--\r\n\r\n                      The Man Who Made The World\r\n\r\n                          By Richard Matheson\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Imagination Stories of Science and Fantasy\r\n                             February 1954\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Doctor Janishefsky sat in his office. Leaning back in a great leather\r\nchair, hands folded. 

He had a reflective air and a well-trimmed goatee.\r\nHe hummed a few bars of--"It Ain\'t Whatcha Do, It\'s The Way Thatcha\r\nDo It." He broke off and looked up with a kindly smile as the nurse\r\nentered. Her name was Mudde._\r\n\r\nNURSE MUDDE. Doctor, there is a man in the waiting room who says he\r\nmade the world.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Oh?\r\n\r\nNURSE MUDDE. Shall I let him in?\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. By all means, Nurse Mudde. Show the man in.\r\n\r\n_Nurse Mudde left. A small man entered. He was five foot five wearing a\r\nsuit made for a man six foot five. His hands were near-hidden by the\r\nsleeve ends, his trouser leg bottoms creased sharply at the shoe tops,\r\nassuming the function of unattached spats. The shoes were virtually\r\ninvisible. As was the gentleman\'s mouth lurking behind a mustache of\r\nmouselike proportions._\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Won\'t you have a seat Mr....\r\n\r\nSMITH. Smith. (_He sits_)\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Now.\r\n\r\n(_They regard each other_)\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. My nurse tells me you made the world.\r\n\r\nSMITH. Yes. (_In a confessional tone_) I did.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. (_Settling back in his chair_) All of it?\r\n\r\nSMITH. Yes.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. And everything in it?\r\n\r\nSMITH. Take a little, give a little.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. You\'re sure of this?\r\n\r\nSMITH. (_With an expression that clearly says--I am telling the truth\r\nthe whole truth and nothing but the truth so help me._) Quite sure.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. (_Nods once_) When did you do this thing?\r\n\r\nSMITH. Five years ago.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. How old are you?\r\n\r\nSMITH. Forty-seven.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Where were you the other forty-two years?\r\n\r\nSMITH. I wasn\'t.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. You mean you started out....\r\n\r\nSMITH. Forty-two years old. That\'s correct.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. But the world is millions of years old.\r\n\r\nSMITH. (_Shaking his head_) No. It isn\'t.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. It\'s five years old.\r\n\r\nSMITH. That\'s correct.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. What about fossils? What about the age of rocks? Uranium into\r\nlead. 

What about diamonds?\r\n\r\nSMITH. (_Not to be bothered_) Illusions.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. You made them up.\r\n\r\nSMITH. That\'s....\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. (_Breaking in_) Why?\r\n\r\nSMITH. To see if I could.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. I don\'t....\r\n\r\nSMITH. 

Anyone can make a world. It takes ingenuity to make one and then\r\nmake the people on it think that it\'s existed for millions of years.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. How long did all this take you?\r\n\r\nSMITH. Three and a half months. World time.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. What do you mean by that?\r\n\r\nSMITH. Before I made the world I lived beyond time.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Where\'s that?\r\n\r\nSMITH. No where.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. In the cosmos?\r\n\r\nSMITH. That\'s correct.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. You didn\'t like it there?\r\n\r\nSMITH. No. It was boring.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. And that\'s why....\r\n\r\nSMITH. I made the world.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Yes. But ... how did you make it?\r\n\r\nSMITH. I had books.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Books?\r\n\r\nSMITH. Instruction books.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Where did you get them?\r\n\r\nSMITH. I made them up.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. You mean you wrote them?\r\n\r\nSMITH. 

I ... made them up.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. How?\r\n\r\nSMITH. (_Mustache bristling truculently_) I made them up.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. (_Lips pursed_) So there you were out in the cosmos with a\r\nhandful of books.\r\n\r\nSMITH. That\'s correct.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. What if you had dropped them?\r\n\r\nSMITH. (_Chooses not to answer this patent absurdity_)\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Mister Smith.\r\n\r\nSMITH. Yes?\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Who made you?\r\n\r\nSMITH. (_Shakes his head_) I don\'t know.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Were you always like this? (_He points at Mr. Smith\'s lowly\r\nframe._)\r\n\r\nSMITH. I don\'t think so. I think that I was punished.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. For what?\r\n\r\nSMITH. For making the world so complicated.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. I should think so.\r\n\r\nSMITH. It\'s not my fault. I just made it, I didn\'t say it would work\r\nright.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. You just started your machine and then walked away.\r\n\r\nSMITH. That\'s....\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Then what are you doing here?\r\n\r\nSMITH. 

I told you. I think I\'ve been punished.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Oh yes. For making it too complicated. I forgot.\r\n\r\nSMITH. That\'s correct.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Who punished you?\r\n\r\nSMITH. I don\'t remember.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. That\'s convenient.\r\n\r\nSMITH. (_Looks morose_)\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Might it be God?\r\n\r\nSMITH. (_Shrugs_) It might.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. He might have a few fingers in the rest of the Universe.\r\n\r\nSMITH. He might. 

But I made the world.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Enough, Mr. Smith, you did not make the world.\r\n\r\nSMITH. (_Insulted_) Yes, I did too.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. And you created me?\r\n\r\nSMITH. (_Concedingly_) Indirectly.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Then uncreate me.\r\n\r\nSMITH. I can\'t.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Why?\r\n\r\nSMITH. I just started things. I don\'t control them now.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. (_Sighs_) Then what are you worried about, Mr. Smith?\r\n\r\nSMITH. I have a premonition.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. What about?\r\n\r\nSMITH. I\'m going to die.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. So...?\r\n\r\nSMITH. Someone has to take over. Or else.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Or else...?\r\n\r\nSMITH. The whole world will go.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Go where?\r\n\r\nSMITH. No where. Just disappear.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. How can it disappear if it works independently of you?\r\n\r\nSMITH. It will be taken away to punish me.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. You?\r\n\r\nSMITH. Yes.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. You mean if you die, the entire world will disappear?\r\n\r\nSMITH. That\'s correct.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. If I shot you, the instant you died I would disappear?\r\n\r\nSMITH. That\'s....\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. I have advice.\r\n\r\nSMITH. 

Yes? You will help?\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Go to see a reputable psychiatrist.\r\n\r\nSMITH. (_Standing_) I should have known. I have no more to say.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. (_Shrugs_) As you will.\r\n\r\nSMITH. I\'ll go but you\'ll be sorry about this.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. I dare say you are already sorry, Mr. Smith.\r\n\r\nSMITH. Goodbye. (_Mr. Smith exits. Doctor Janishefsky calls for his\r\nnurse over the interphone. Nurse Mudde enters._)\r\n\r\nNURSE M. Yes, doctor?\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Nurse Mudde, stand by the window and tell me what you see.\r\n\r\nNURSE M. What I...?\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. What you see. I want you to tell me what Mr. Smith does after\r\nhe comes out of the building.\r\n\r\nNURSE M. (_Shrugs_) Yes, doctor. (_She goes to the window_)\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Has he come out yet?\r\n\r\nNURSE M. No.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Keep watching.\r\n\r\nNURSE M. There he is. He\'s stepping off the curb. He\'s walking across\r\nthe street.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Yes.\r\n\r\nNURSE M. He\'s stopping now in the middle of the street. He\'s turning.\r\nHe\'s looking up at this window. There\'s a look of ... of ...\r\n_realization_ on his face. He\'s coming back. (_She screams_) He\'s been\r\nhit by a car. He\'s lying on the street....\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. What is it, Nurse Mudde?\r\n\r\nNurse M. (_Reeling_) Everything is ... is _fading_! Doctor Janishefsky,\r\nit\'s fading! (_Another scream_)\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Don\'t be absurd, Nurse Mudde. Look at me. 

Can you honestly\r\nsay that.... (_He stops talking. She cannot honestly say anything. 

She\r\nis not there. Doctor Janishefsky who is not really Doctor Janishefsky\r\nfloats alone in the cosmos in his chair which is not really a chair.\r\nHe looks at the chair beside him._) I hope you\'ve learned your lesson.\r\nI\'m going to put your toy back but don\'t you dare go near it. So you\'re\r\nbored are you? 

Scalliwag! You just behave yourself or I\'ll take away\r\nyour books too! (_He snorts_) So you made them up, did you? (He looks\r\naround). 

How about picking them up, jackanapes!\r\n\r\nSMITH. (_Who is not really Smith_) Yes, father.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MAN WHO MADE THE WORLD ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!)

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
