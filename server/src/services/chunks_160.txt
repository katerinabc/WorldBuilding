]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is infinitely more satisfactory to purchase wives when they are\r\nyoung. They are vastly more respectful.\r\n\r\nTwelve is a good purchasing age. Lisa was twelve when I bargained for\r\nher, and she is an illustrious argument for the system.\r\n\r\nI recall her excellent father and I facing each other across his\r\ngleaming synthol marble table that day. On the table were small metal\r\nshells of sweet liquor. And beside the shells were the sedulously\r\ngathered treasures I was formally offering for Lisa: A control knob,\r\nand a folded painting of one of our Navigator\'s other-ship visions.\r\n\r\nLisa\'s father eagerly examined the mirror-bright, chrome surface\r\nof the control knob--which I had handed to him with a pretense of\r\ncasualness--trying to still the trembling of his fingers.\r\n\r\n"The last knob on the control board!" he said in an emotion-cracked\r\nvoice. 

"How could you have broken it off? We\'ve all been tugging at it\r\nfor years."\r\n\r\nI answered--I hope with no more than legitimate pride--"I managed to\r\nget a thin hacksaw blade between the knob and the control board. Then I\r\nsawed off the shaft."\r\n\r\nHe nodded approvingly. "With knuckle-headed men like you aboard ship we\r\nwill certainly all go to _Hell_."\r\n\r\nI bowed, but I did not let his flattery relax my caution. After all, we\r\nwere bargaining for his prettiest daughter. What flattering words bear\r\nweight in the midst of a sale? He, of course, referred to the ringing\r\nsincerity of our Navigator\'s dying words: "If you knuckle-heads all\r\nwant to go to _Hell_, just keep dismantling the ship!"\r\n\r\nSwinging adroitly to my other item of barter, I mused aloud, "Our\r\nNavigator! What a strange, frantic creature he was. Full of the wild,\r\nlovely visions which effervesced from his books of fantasy. Imploring\r\nus not only to read the books but to believe them--and, failing that,\r\ndrawing immortal paintings of the fantasies for us to see."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTherewith I opened the folded painting and handed it reverently to him.\r\nIt showed a large globular ship with people living on the _outside_ of\r\nit. The title of the painting was _Planet_.\r\n\r\nPrivately I had always thought the thing was wholly unnatural--a\r\ncurious off-beat of the master\'s imagination. I was quite willing,\r\ndespite its great beauty and its origin, to exchange it for something\r\nwhich to me was far more attractive at the moment. Namely a woman.\r\n\r\nLisa lay curled up on the narrow, in-wall couch, with her head propped\r\nup by a slim arm. She chewed her synthel-gum lazily and surveyed me\r\nwith mild interest. 

She was a tender-featured girl, with shimmering\r\nblack, shoulder-length hair. It was possible to forecast that she would\r\nsome day be a lovely and gentle-hearted woman.\r\n\r\nHer father, notwithstanding his habitually rigid integrity, saw my\r\nlively interest in her and tried to increase my generous bid for her by\r\nan artifice of delay.\r\n\r\nHolding the painting of the master at arm\'s length, he grumbled\r\ncritically, "A vision of _Hell_ would have been more to my liking.\r\nUnhappily our Navigator did not paint one of his radiant visions of\r\nthat ship. Now, why would he prefer _Planet_ to _Hell_--particularly\r\nwhen he described _Hell_ as warm and enclosed like our own ship?"\r\n\r\nI did not answer his frivolous complaint, knowing full well it was only\r\nbartering talk.\r\n\r\nHe handled the immortal painting with crudely feigned indifference. He\r\ncould not quite bring himself to let go of it. He was determined to own\r\nit, I knew, and he sensed also my resolve to offer no more for Lisa.\r\nYet slyly he determined on an evil course.\r\n\r\nFor, incredibly, he turned to tranquil Lisa and asked: "What is your\r\nvalue, lovely child? Does he offer enough?"\r\n\r\nAnd slowly lifting her candid eyes to him she shook her head NO!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Shall I bargain with _her_ then?" I asked my friend caustically. I\r\nwill own I was vexed.\r\n\r\nShrewdly he nodded. "Whatever she accepts will be our bargain." Then,\r\nlaughing at my undignified discomfiture, "It is manifest she is more\r\naware of her value than I."\r\n\r\n"Will you be serious? It is not kindly to banter with a woman-child in\r\nsuch an important matter as her future."\r\n\r\nBut greed now fully possessed him. "I do not joke. Whatever she demands\r\nshall be her price." He sipped his sweet wine, hiding his eyes from my\r\ndispleasure.\r\n\r\nConcealing my fury, I turned to Lisa, who now sat up straight on the\r\nnarrow couch with her long, slender legs folded under her. In the pace\r\nof grievous mortification I was not bitter toward her. 

It was not her\r\nfault. For her I extended the tolerance due the innocent.\r\n\r\n"What is your cost, child?" I asked. "This control knob and other-ship\r\nvision of our Navigator are sufficient to purchase any girl-woman. What\r\nwill you have?"\r\n\r\nLisa chewed her gum slowly while she formed her serene thought. Then,\r\nshaking her oval head, she let fall in a dreamy, singsong voice,\r\n"Neither of these! Neither of these!

"\r\n\r\nHer father leaned forward anxiously. I told her, "There is a limit to\r\nyour value. I will not give all of my treasures for you, lovely though\r\nyou are. Choose what thing you will have, and if I can procure it, your\r\nfather shall have it."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll know it when I see it!" she said, smiling impudently.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was nothing for me to do but go to my apartments and look for\r\nother treasures to show her. My thoughts were exceedingly bitter as I\r\ngathered the coveted articles one by one in my arms.\r\n\r\n"Here." I displayed it to her when I had arrived back at her father\'s\r\nabode. "It is the steering wheel from the lifeboat. Feel its smooth\r\ntexture, see its ebony luster. It is the only lifeboat steering wheel\r\naboard ship. I had a terrible struggle with it until I broke off the\r\nshaft.

"\r\n\r\nShe seemed interested. I passed hurriedly on to another object. "Here\r\nis the handle of the atomic-pile damping rod. It was threaded inside.\r\nHowever, I have managed to grind the interior smooth."\r\n\r\nShe seemed definitely interested, but I did not linger. 

I unrolled the\r\nlast treasure I had brought with me. At the sight of it her father\r\nburst into merry chuckles.\r\n\r\n"Yes," I said, smiling with a hint of sadness. "It is the inscrutable\r\nmessage we found protruding from the mouth of a machine some years ago.\r\nThe machine has the name Teletype engraved upon it. We cannot imagine\r\nwho put the message inside the machine--if indeed it is a message.\r\nBut listen to the poetry of its words! I shall read it to you as\r\nthough it were properly set out on paper instead of being cramped into\r\ncontinuous, senseless lines:\r\n\r\n    "Colony ship, colony ship,\r\n    Turn around before it is too late.\r\n    You have left the Galaxy.\r\n    We are the last planetary system\r\n    You will encounter,\r\n    For ten thousand years."\r\n\r\nThen, seeing her puzzlement, I said hastily, "But, of course, it is\r\ntoo adult for you, Lisa. Its mystery is for the scholar, its abstract\r\nbeauty for the man of mature years. Come, let us turn back to these\r\nother treasures...."\r\n\r\nIt was not easy for her to choose, seemingly, with so much wealth about\r\nher. The control knob, the painting, the lifeboat steering wheel, the\r\natomic-pile damping-rod handle, the inscrutable poetry--all claimed her\r\ninterest. But in the end she chose as I wanted her to, and the bargain\r\nwas struck.\r\n\r\nLisa went to live in the compartment of my concubines that day, and at\r\nmaturity became a concubine of exotic beauty. She bore her dark-haired\r\nchildren well.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy the excellence of her father, he and I continued to be good friends.\r\nAt least once a year I invite him to view the master\'s painting of\r\n_Planet_. We spend many contented hours together. 

Often through a\r\nporthole we watch the rapid movement of distant ships which our\r\nNavigator called _stars_, revolving in tiny circles at the side of the\r\nship, making a complete circle in about two minutes. What prompts the\r\nbehavior of these ships? It is all very curious, and I account myself\r\nfortunate that I have in my friend an intense capacity for speculation.\r\nLike myself, he is a scholar of honor, capable of long sustained\r\ndiscourse on lofty subjects which round out and deepen the mind. I\r\nforgive him his greed.\r\n\r\nAs I had intended, Lisa took the teletype nonsense message to be\r\nher value to her father. May I reiterate, it is infinitely more\r\nsatisfactory to purchase wives when they are very young ladies? 

They\r\nare vastly more respectful. Admittedly they are saucy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE CONNOISSEUR ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
