But he doesn\'t just\r\n    stand and watch the big planes roar past overhead. He has the\r\n    kind of brilliant technical know-how which makes what goes on\r\n    inside of a plane of paramount interest to him. He\'s\r\n    interested, too, in the future superduper gadgetry, as this\r\n    hilarious yarn attests._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL APPLICATION\r\n\r\n_by ... John Victor Peterson_\r\n\r\n\r\n    If matter transference really works--neanderthalers can pop up\r\n    anywhere. And that\'s very hard on politicians!\r\n\r\n\r\nSome say scientists should keep their noses out of politics. Benson\r\nsays it\'s to prevent damage to their olfactory senses. Benson\'s a\r\nphysicist.\r\n\r\nI\'ve known Allan Benson for a long time. In fact I\'ve bodyguarded him\r\nfor years and think I understand him better than he does himself. And\r\nwhen he shook security at White Sands, my boss didn\'t hesitate to tell\r\nme that knowing Benson as I do I certainly shouldn\'t have let him skip\r\noff. Or crisp words to that effect.\r\n\r\nThe pressure was on. Benson was seeking a new fuel--or a way of\r\ncompressing a known fuel--to carry a torchship to Mars. His loss could\r\nmean a delay of decades. 

We knew he\'d been close, but not _how_ close.\r\n\r\nMy nickname\'s Monk. I\'ve fought it, certainly, but what can you do\r\nwhen a well-wishing mother names you after a wealthy uncle and your\r\nbirth certificate says Neander Thalberg? As early as high school some\r\nbright pundit noted the name\'s similarity to that of a certain\r\nprehistoric man. Unfortunately the similarity is not in name alone:\r\nI\'m muscular, stooped, and, I must admit, not handsome hero model\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nWell, maybe the nickname\'s justified, but still, Al Benson didn\'t have\r\nto give the crowning insult. And yet, if he hadn\'t, there probably\r\nwouldn\'t be a torchship stern-ending on Mars just about now.\r\n\r\nC. 

I. (Central Intelligence, that is) at the Sands figured Benson\r\nwould head for New York. Which is why the boss sent me here. I\r\nregistered in a hotel in the 50\'s and, figuring that whatever Benson\r\nintended to do would have spectacular results, I kept the stereo on\r\nNews.\r\n\r\nBenson\'s wife hadn\'t yielded much info. Sure she described the clothes\r\nhe was wearing and said he\'d taken nothing else except an artist\'s\r\ncase. What was in that was anybody\'s guess; his private lab is such a\r\njumble nobody could tell what, if anything, was missing.\r\n\r\nC. I. knew his political feelings. Seems he\'d been talking wild about\r\nthe upcoming presidential election and had sworn he\'d nip the\r\ndraft-Cadigan movement in the bud. Cadigan\'s Mayor of New York City.\r\nHe\'s anti-space. In fact, Cadigan\'s anti just about everything in\r\nscience except intercontinental missiles. Strictly for defense, of\r\ncourse. Cadigan says.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA weathercaster was making rash promises on the stereo when the potray\r\ndinged. The potray? I certainly wasn\'t expecting mail. Only C. I. knew\r\nwhere I was and they\'d have closed-circuited me on visio if they\r\nwanted contact.\r\n\r\nThe potray dinged and there was a package in it.\r\n\r\nNow matter transference I knew. It put mailmen out of business.\r\nThere\'s a potray in every domicile and you can put things in it, dial\r\nthe destination and they come out there. They come out the same size\r\nand weight and in the same condition as they went in, provided they\r\ndidn\'t go in alive. Life loses, as many a shade of a hopeful guinea\r\npig could relate.\r\n\r\nSo the potray dinged and here was this package. At first glance it\r\nlooked like one of those cereal samples manufacturers have been\r\neverlastingly sending through since postal rates dropped after cost of\r\nthe potrays had been amortized. But cereal samples don\'t come through\r\nat midday; they\'re night traffic stuff.\r\n\r\nThe package was light, its wrapping curiously smooth. There was an\r\nenvelope attached with my correct name and potray number. Whoever had\r\nmailed it must be in C. I. or must know someone in C. I. who knew\r\nwhere I was.\r\n\r\nThe postmark was blurred but I could make out that it had been cast\r\nfrom Grand Central. Time didn\'t matter. It couldn\'t have been cast\r\nmore than a microsecond earlier.\r\n\r\nThe envelope contained a card upon which was typed:\r\n\r\n"Caution! Site on cylinder of 2 ft. 

radius and 6 ft. 

height. Unwrap at\r\narmslength."\r\n\r\nNow what? A practical joke? If so, it must be Benson\'s work. He\'s\r\nplayed plenty, from pumping hydrogen sulphide (that\'s rotten egg gas,\r\nas you know) into the air-conditioning system at high school to\r\ncalling a gynecologist to the launching stage at the Sands to sever an\r\numbilical cord which he neglected to say was on a Viking rocket.\r\n\r\nI followed the instructions. As I bent back the first fold of the\r\nstrange wrapping it came alive, unfolding itself with incredible\r\nswiftness.\r\n\r\nSomething burst forth like a freed djinn--almost instantaneously\r\nlengthening, spreading--a thing with beetling brows, low, broad\r\nforehead, prognathous jaw, and a hunched, brutally muscular body, with\r\na great club over its swollen shoulder.\r\n\r\nI went precipitously backward over a coffee table.\r\n\r\nIt stabilized, a dead mockery, replica of a Neanderthal.\r\n\r\nA placard hung on its chest. I read this:\r\n\r\n"Even some of the early huntsmen weren\'t successful. Abandon the\r\nchase, Monk. 

I\'ve things to do and this--your blood brother, no\r\ndoubt--couldn\'t catch me any more than you can!"\r\n\r\nWhich positively infuriated me.\r\n\r\nDo you blame me?\r\n\r\nA few cussing, cussed minutes later I realized what Al Benson had\r\napparently done: solved the torchship\'s fuel problem.\r\n\r\nOh, I\'d seen Klein bottles and Mobius strips and other things that\r\ntwist in on themselves and into other dimensions, twisting into\r\nmicrocosms and macrocosms--into elsewhere, in any event. And here I\r\nhad visual evidence that Benson had had something nearly six feet tall\r\nand certainly two feet in breadth enclosed in a nearly weightless\r\ncarton less than eight inches on the side!\r\n\r\nSufficient fuel for a Marstrip? Just wrap it up!\r\n\r\nThe stereo\'s audio was saying: "... from the Museum of Natural\r\nHistory. Curators are compiling a list of the missing exhibits which\r\nwe will reveal to you on this channel as soon as it\'s available. Now\r\nwe switch to Dick Joy at City Hall with news of the latest exhibit\r\nfound. Come in, Dick!"\r\n\r\nOn the steps of City Hall was a full size replica of a mastodon over\r\nwhose massive back was draped a banner bearing the slogan: "The\r\nUniversal Party is for you! Don\'t return to prehistory with Cadigan!\r\nRe-elect President Ollie James and go to the stars!"\r\n\r\nAnd there was a closeup of Mayor Cadigan standing pompous and\r\nwrathful--and looking very diminutive--behind the emblem of his\r\nopposition party.\r\n\r\nDick Joy was saying, "Eyewitnesses claim that this replica--obviously\r\none of the items stolen from the Museum of Natural History--suddenly\r\nmaterialized here. Immediately prior to the alleged materialization a\r\nman--whose photograph we show now--ostensibly bent down to tie a\r\nshoelace, setting a shoebox beside him. He left the box, walking off\r\ninto the gathering crowd, and this mastodon _seemed_ to spring into\r\nbeing where the shoebox had been.\r\n\r\n"The mastodon replica has been examined. A report just handed me says\r\nit is definitely that from the Museum and that it could not\r\nconceivably have been contained in a shoebox. It\'s obviously a case of\r\nmass hypnotism. The replica must have been trucked here. There\'s no\r\nother possible explanation. 

Excuse me!"\r\n\r\nDick Joy turned away, then back.\r\n\r\n"I have just been handed a notice that Mayor Cadigan wishes to say a\r\nfew words and I hereby introduce him, His Honor the Mayor, Joseph F.\r\nCadigan!"\r\n\r\nHis balding, fragmentarily curly-haired Honor glared.\r\n\r\n"Friends," he said chokingly, "whatever madman is responsible for this\r\noutrageous act will not go unpunished. I call upon the City\'s Finest\r\nto track him down and bring him to justice.\r\n\r\n"I am for justice, for equality and peace. I--"\r\n\r\nHis Honor was apparently determined to use all the time he could.\r\nBeing a newscast, it was for free.\r\n\r\nI killed the stereo. And the visio rang. It was Phil Pollini, the C.\r\nI. Chief.\r\n\r\n"Monk," he said, "guess you\'ve seen the stereo. Al\'s out to fix the\r\nMayor\'s wagon."\r\n\r\n"Say that again," I said, having a brainstorm.\r\n\r\n"Now, look--" he started.\r\n\r\n"Maybe you\'ve got something there, Chief," I cut in. "Cadigan\'s got\r\nthe superduper of all wagons--a seven passenger luxury limousine with\r\nbulletproof glass, stereo, a bar, venetian blinds and heaven knows\r\nwhat else. Hot and cold running androids, maybe. 

He prowls the\r\nelevated highways with an \'In Conference\' sign flashing over the\r\nwindshield. So\'s he can\'t be wire-tapped or miked, I guess. It\'d be a\r\nnatch for Al Benson to go for."\r\n\r\nPollini grinned.\r\n\r\n"So if you were Benson what\'d you do to fix the Mayor\'s wagon?"\r\n\r\n"Hitch it to a star," I said, "and the closest spot to a star would be\r\nthe observation platform of the Greater Empire State."\r\n\r\n"You\'re probably right," the Chief said. "Get going!"\r\n\r\nI got.\r\n\r\nTen minutes later I walked out onto the observation platform on the\r\n150th floor of the Greater Empire State Building--and found an\r\nincredulous crowd gathered around the mayor\'s limousine. I felt good.\r\nI\'d predicted.\r\n\r\nI asked a guard, "How\'d it get here?"\r\n\r\nHis eyebrows were threatening a back somersault.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t know," he said. "I was looking over the side; then turned\r\naround and here it was! 

You have any ideas?"\r\n\r\nWhich is when I spotted Al Benson.\r\n\r\nI settled for shoving Benson toward the elevator, being careful since\r\nhe had a box under each arm. We made the elevator and went down and it\r\nstopped on the 120th floor and the operator said, "Change here for all\r\nlower floors and the street--"\r\n\r\nAs we waited on the 120th for the down elevator, the P. A. system\r\nbarked:\r\n\r\n"Attention all building occupants. By order of the Mayor no one will\r\nbe permitted to leave the building until further notice. Please remain\r\nwhere you are. 

We will try not to inconvenience you for any great\r\ntime."\r\n\r\nThere was no one close to us.\r\n\r\n"Al," I said, "look, stinker, you\'ve had your fun but this is it. I\r\ndon\'t know what you\'ve got in those boxes but you\'ve got to turn them\r\nover--and yourself--to the next copper who shows. This is a civil\r\nmatter, strictly local, and not C. I.

"\r\n\r\nBenson grinned. "Got to make a delivery first, Monk. Look, there\'s a\r\npotray over there. Can I use it?"\r\n\r\nHis grin was infectious. 

"So what are you going to send where?" I\r\nasked as sternly as I could.\r\n\r\n"The Mayor\'s personal files," he said. "I managed to carry them out of\r\nCity Hall--once they\'d been suitably wrapped, of course! I\'m sending\r\nthem to the Senate Investigation Committee. Don\'t worry, Monk, His\r\nHonor won\'t be President this or any year!"\r\n\r\nI helped him dial the SIC number.\r\n\r\n"What about the other package?" I asked him then.\r\n\r\n"Insurance," he said. "Come out on the setback."\r\n\r\nHe placed the last package on the mosaic tile of the terrace, untied\r\nits string, flipped open the edge of the Benson wrapping and jumped\r\nback.\r\n\r\nIt was an NYC police helicopter.\r\n\r\nWe potrayed it back from the Sands. Suitably wrapped, of course.\r\n\r\nThat was a month ago. Most of it never came out in the papers. Nothing\r\nof Benson\'s invention. C. I. thought it should be squelched, at least\r\nuntil Benson and the boys get back from Mars.\r\n\r\nWhich would be the end except for the packages. Yes, Benson left a\r\ngross of them with me and I\'ve been mailing them one a day to the\r\nleaders of the opposition party. I don\'t truly know what\'s in them, of\r\ncourse. But it\'s very curious that the day before the torchship left\r\nexactly one hundred and forty-four cylinders of hydrogen sulphide were\r\nmissing from quartermaster stores. Coincidentally one of my C. I.\r\nfriends tells me Benson had him rig up a gross of automatic releases\r\nfor gas cylinders.\r\n\r\nAdding it up, it could be a good lesson for politicians to keep their\r\nnoses out of science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s Political Application, by John Victor Peterson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK POLITICAL APPLICATION ***\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\xe2\x80\x99s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
