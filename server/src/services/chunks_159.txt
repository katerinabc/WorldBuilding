Ashman]\r\n\r\n\r\nOPERATION LORELIE\r\n\r\nBY WILLIAM P. SALTON\r\n\r\n\r\n    _It was a new time and a vast new war of complete and awful\r\n    annihilation. Yet, some things never change, and, as in ancient\r\n    times, Ulysses walked again--brave and unconquerable--and again, the\r\n    sirens wove their deadly spell with a smile and a song._\r\n\r\n\r\nThey came like monsters, rather than men, into the vast ruin of what had\r\nonce been a great city. They walked carefully, side by side, speaking to\r\neach other by radio as though they were in deep space rather than upon\r\nsolid ground.\r\n\r\nThe winding way they followed through the ruins was marked by blurred\r\nfootsteps in the dust and the two men, clumsy in their bulky suits,\r\nfound the going difficult.\r\n\r\nThey stopped, and one of them held out an instrument. He studied the\r\ndial. 

"All clear," and both men removed their helmets. They wiped sweat\r\nfrom their faces and glanced at each other.\r\n\r\nThe blonde man said, "The air\'s okay, Jarvis. Everything seems all\r\nright. 

I don\'t get it."\r\n\r\nJarvis, his dark eyes wary, scowled as he looked about. "It seems all\r\nright. 

But we know it isn\'t. 

It can\'t be."\r\n\r\n"I\'m shucking this suit."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be a fool, Mark!"\r\n\r\n"But the dial read _clear_, man! And we know nobody is going to shoot\r\nus. All life _had_ to be wiped out.

"\r\n\r\n"How about minor power installations?"\r\n\r\nJarvis took a chocolate bar from his pocket, sat down on a piece of\r\nbroken rubble and began to eat. "You\'re too careless--far too careless,\r\nMark."\r\n\r\nMark laughed. "You\'ve always been cautious enough for both of us. Got me\r\nout of plenty of scrapes back in school, too. Don\'t think I\'ve\r\nforgotten." Affection warmed his blue eyes as they rested on the face of\r\nhis friend.\r\n\r\n"Okay! Okay! 

But what happened to them? 

Where did they go?" Jarvis took\r\nnervous bites from his second chocolate bar. Then he, too, peeled off\r\nhis suit. He sniffed the air distrustfully, as he wiggled his shoulders\r\nto free them from the clinging, damp shirt. Then he took a few\r\nexperimental steps forward.\r\n\r\n"Seems all right, Mark. But how do you explain about Hank and Garland?\r\nNever were two more careful guys."\r\n\r\n"Probably a simple miscalculation. Or an accident. We know it couldn\'t\r\nhave been enemy action. Tests prove conclusively that we wiped them\r\nout--to a man." He took deep gulps of air into his lungs, and stretched\r\nlike a cat. "We\'ll find out soon enough. 

Boy, I feel great!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey deflated and folded their safety suits and added the bundles to the\r\nother equipment on their backs. Then, with their instruments held before\r\nthem, they probed their way into the twisted wreckage, still following\r\nthe faint, dust-filled footprints.\r\n\r\nBent and rusted girders rose on all sides like the bones of prehistoric\r\nmonsters. Nothing stirred. The dust lay ages-thick on everything.\r\n\r\n"Gives you the spooks, doesn\'t it?" Jarvis was still tense, poised to\r\nrespond to the first signal of danger. "Feels like we\'re the last men\r\nalive!"\r\n\r\n"Funny about Hank and Garland. There\'s nothing here to harm anyone."\r\n\r\nJarvis looked at his watch. "Better contact HQ for instructions."\r\n\r\nThe two stepped off the path, into the shade of a grotesque chunk of\r\nbroken masonry. Mark set up the radio and twirled the dials. "Team Four,\r\ncalling HQ. Team Four, reporting!"\r\n\r\n"HQ here." The voice from the radio blared loud in the stillness. "Give\r\nyour report, Team Four."\r\n\r\n"Looks like nothing\'s moved here in a thousand years. Safe as a baby\'s\r\ndream. Rock-solid, air morning-pure. But--" He hesitated, trying not to\r\nsound like a scared school boy. "No sign of Team Three. Or of Teams One\r\nand Two, either. Over."\r\n\r\n"Look here, Team Four. It\'s your job to find out. The earth didn\'t just\r\nswallow them. Final report from each team placed them well within the\r\ncity. It\'s been ten days since the last contact. Probe every inch of the\r\nplace."\r\n\r\n"Right!"\r\n\r\n"But be careful. We can\'t afford to lose any more men! Roger!"\r\n\r\n"Roger!"\r\n\r\nThere was only one way now--ahead. It lay clearly marked. 

The dim\r\nfootsteps never strayed or faltered. Three hours of search revealed no\r\npitfalls, no dangers, and no trace of the missing men. Then night was\r\nupon them and they bedded down gratefully.\r\n\r\n"Strange, isn\'t it? The war over. The invaders blasted from the earth.\r\nAll peril gone. And yet--men disappear."\r\n\r\nJarvis stared at the ruins around them. "I can\'t take much more, Mark.\r\nTwelve years of war is enough. Are we never to have a life--have our\r\nhome and women back, and--_peace_?"\r\n\r\n"Sure, it\'s been tough. But think of the women and children isolated on\r\nthat sub-satellite. It\'s tougher for them--just waiting." Stretched on\r\nhis back, Mark stared at the cloudless, evening sky. "But pretty soon\r\nwe\'ll get this planet cleaned up and bring them in. Christ! Four years\r\nwithout even seeing a woman. I remember the last time--"\r\n\r\n"Okay!" Jarvis interrupted impatiently. "Let\'s get to sleep."\r\n\r\n"Sure, pal. Goodnight."\r\n\r\nThey fell asleep to dream of green hills, corn ripening, apples roasting\r\nover an open fire. Peace, and home, and girls, their firm legs flashing\r\nin the sun.\r\n\r\nSoldierlike, Mark was suddenly awake. He lay without motion, sensitive\r\nto some subtle change in the surroundings. From the corner of his eye he\r\ncould see Jarvis wrapped in sleep. The silence seemed eternal.\r\n\r\nThen, whisper-soft, came a murmur, a sound, a voice. A girl\'s voice,\r\nsighing and singing, from deep in that devastated spot.\r\n\r\nA woman!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nInstantly, Mark was on his feet. No need to wake Jarvis. Plenty of time\r\nfor Jarvis to find out--afterwards. But not yet! A miracle that a girl\r\nhad survived in all that wreckage. But a miracle he wanted to savour\r\nalone!\r\n\r\nAhead, the path turned and Mark followed it as it went forward again,\r\ndownhill, between the massed walls of rubble. Now the voice swelled, a\r\nmelancholy song. Well, she won\'t be melancholy for long, Mark thought.\r\nHer solitary ordeal was over.\r\n\r\n"Mark!" Jarvis stood on an upturned lintel, ten feet above Mark\'s head.\r\nAs Mark jerked to a stop at the cry, Jarvis jumped into his path. "You\r\nfool! 

Don\'t you know it\'s a trap?"\r\n\r\n"So that\'s how you want to play it? The noble friend, protecting me from\r\nmyself!" He slammed a fist into the side of Jarvis\' head. "Well, I won\'t\r\nbite! 

She\'s mine! I found her!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn silence, in the narrow passage between the rocks, the two fought.\r\nSuddenly, above the sound of fist on flesh, came the voice of the girl\r\nagain, clear, young. "She _is_ there," thought Jarvis. He could almost\r\ntaste her lips on his. The sensation came as a shock. How did he know?\r\nHe\'d never had a woman. That\'s what came from listening to the tales of\r\nMark\'s exploits with women. Now he had to have that girl!\r\n\r\nThe mounting tension of the fighting snapped something in Jarvis\'\r\nseething mind. Danger, friendship, duty, all meant nothing. Only one\r\nthing mattered. The girl! Mark had had more than his share of girls. He,\r\nJarvis, was the one who should have her! He\'d been deprived of his\r\nmanhood long enough! His frenzied brain hunted a trick to gain his ends.\r\n\r\nMark\'s superior strength began to force Jarvis to give ground. Then a\r\nfinal blow sent him reeling, he reached out to break his fall, his hand\r\nclosed on a rock. He threw it. Mark crashed to the ground, his knee\r\nsmashed, his leg useless. Then the tomb stillness of the dead city took\r\nover. The dust settled slowly. Mark came to his feet.\r\n\r\nJarvis was gone.\r\n\r\nDragging his useless leg, Mark forced himself to crawl forward. Jarvis\r\nhad to be stopped.\r\n\r\nAhead, a shadow moved, and for a moment the moon threw the silhouette of\r\na man against a cavernous opening in the debris.\r\n\r\n"Jarvis!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn electric flash shattered the darkness. The jagged teeth of the bolt\r\nspit tongues of fire. Cordite mingled with the raw, nauseant, revolting\r\nsmell of scorched flesh and hair. The figure tottered and fell into the\r\nblack mouth of the cave. Then, as the flame faded, it lit up small\r\nbundles of charred bones near the fallen body.\r\n\r\nThere was a whir and a click of a mechanism. Fifteen feet away, Mark\r\nwatched as the arm of a phonograph rose, moved slowly back to the\r\nstarting point. Then the record began once more to grind out its\r\ndeath-trap melody.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ March 1954.

It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
