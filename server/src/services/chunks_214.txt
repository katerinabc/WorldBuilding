Naturally he wanted\r\n to go along. 

But could he smuggle himself aboard?\r\n\r\n\r\n            Illustrated by Lloyd Rognan\r\n\r\n\r\nDad had already gone when Bobby got up. This disappointed Bobby a little\r\nbut then he remembered--_this was the big day_. Naturally Dad would get\r\nover to the project early. And at four o\'clock-- Bobby shivered\r\ndeliciously at the thought of it.\r\n\r\nHe ate his breakfast in silence with Mom across the table drinking a cup\r\nof coffee and looking at a fashion catalogue. He was glad she was\r\noccupied because he didn\'t want to talk; not today he didn\'t. Might\r\nspill something secret. 

Might even let out the _big secret_. That would\r\nbe terrible.\r\n\r\nOf course, all things were secret at Buffalo Flats. So secret top\r\nscientists like Dad didn\'t even discuss them with wives like Mom. And\r\nwives like Mom never asked.\r\n\r\nSo it was really something to sit there eating breakfast knowing that,\r\ntoday, Dad was going to rocket to the Moon. And with Mom not even\r\nknowing the Lunar project was in the works, so naturally not dreaming\r\nthat he was going _with_ Dad! The thrill was overpowering.\r\n\r\nMaybe they would have radio communication after they got there and he\r\nwould call back and say, _Hello, Mom! Guess where I am? On the moon with\r\nDad!_ And Mom would say, _Why, Bobby! Scaring me to death like this! I\r\nwas looking all over for you._ Sounding very angry but not being really\r\nangry after all. Because maybe Dad would cut in and say, _Yeah, he\'s\r\nright here with me, dear. What do you think of this boy of ours?_\r\n\r\nBobby gulped the last of his cereal so he could go outside and wriggle\r\nfor joy. As he got up from his chair, Mom said, "And what\'s your plan\r\nfor today, young man? Davy Crockett or Buck Rogers?"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBobby had a quick thought--a sudden temptation. Why not give Mom a hint?\r\nWhy he could even _tell_ her and she still wouldn\'t know. Then later,\r\nafter he was gone, she would remember back and say, _That boy! When he\r\ntells you something he really means it._\r\n\r\nBobby smiled and said, "I think I\'ll go to the moon today."\r\n\r\nMom smiled too and went back to her fashions. "Well, see to it your fuel\r\nmixture is correct."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll check it. And Mom--I might not be home for lunch."\r\n\r\n"Where will you be?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know.

"\r\n\r\n"Well, mind your manners and say thank you when you leave."\r\n\r\nMrs. Kendall, still smiling, watched Bobby dash out into the yard.\r\nLiving on a restricted government area had one compensation at least.\r\nYou didn\'t have to worry about your children. Four dozen families, all\r\nwith offspring, trapped behind ten-foot patrolled fence. Here, nobody\r\nworried about their children. They came and went and at noon a mother\r\nfed whatever number happened to be in the house at the time. Mrs.\r\nKendall usually drew six or seven. It would be a relief to dodge the\r\nchore for one Saturday....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOut in the backyard, Bobby fussed around his space rocket a little:\r\ntightening a screw here--hammering in a nail there. Just until he could\r\nslip away without Mom noticing his direction.\r\n\r\nIt wasn\'t a bad rocket at that, he thought. Six feet long with two seats\r\nand a keen instrument panel. But kid stuff of course. After he found the\r\nway in through the sewer he hadn\'t paid any more attention to his own\r\nship.\r\n\r\nHe could see Mom through the window, back in her book, so he went\r\ncasually out through the back gate and turned left, kicking at pebbles\r\nas he sauntered along and trying to look as though he had no place to\r\ngo. Had to be careful. Didn\'t want to bump into any of the other kids\r\ntoday, either.\r\n\r\nThe way in through the sewer was at a place behind Laboratory B. There\r\nwas a kind of an alley there that nobody ever walked through and then\r\nthis round lid you could lift up and look under. And a ladder you could\r\nclimb down.\r\n\r\nBobby hadn\'t dared go down at first. But, after thinking about it\r\novernight, his curiosity won out and he went back and ducked down\r\ninto the lower level. He called it a sewer because of sewers being\r\nunderground, but this place was clean and had bunches of wires strung\r\nin every direction and faint little lights you could see by.\r\n\r\nBobby went further and further every trip he took, never telling anybody\r\nbecause you weren\'t supposed to talk about things at Buffalo Flats--not\r\neven to the other kids.\r\n\r\nThen he found the big drome where they were building the rocket. It was\r\nso sleek and beautiful and shiny that he just stared at it--up through\r\nthe grating in the floor that was for air circulation or something.\r\n\r\nHe didn\'t know it was the moon rocket at first. Not until he\'d gone back\r\nseveral times to peek up at it and then one day two scientists came\r\nwalking along right in front of his nose.\r\n\r\nOne of them was Dad.\r\n\r\nBobby almost called out but he caught himself and just listened to them\r\ntalking. This was the first time his conscience bothered him about going\r\nunderneath the drome. He thought about it a lot--whether it was the\r\nright thing to do. And while he was never able to still his conscience\r\ncompletely, he quieted down by saying he really wasn\'t doing any harm\r\nbecause he\'d never told anybody what he saw.\r\n\r\nHe learned the rocket was going to the moon by listening to Dad and the\r\nother scientists talk when they thought they were alone. And it was\r\nfunny. Because even there, they spoke in low voices and didn\'t give too\r\nmuch away.\r\n\r\nHe had known now for three days that at four o\'clock the roof would open\r\nand the drome would be turned into a blast-pit and the rocket would\r\nshoot out through space to the moon.\r\n\r\nThat was all he _did_ know for sure. None of the men had said who was\r\ngoing on the first trip to the moon. Nothing had been said on that\r\nsubject at all, but Bobby knew Dad would go. He would have to. After\r\nall, Dad was the second biggest scientist at Buffalo Flats. Second only\r\nto Schleimmer himself and Professor Schleimmer was very old and\r\ncertainly wouldn\'t make the trip. That left Dad. Dad would just have to\r\ngo in order to run the rocket. There probably wasn\'t anybody else smart\r\nenough in the whole place.\r\n\r\nThe idea of going himself had been born the previous day--when he found\r\na larger grating in the floor near the rocket and realized if he was\r\nvery careful he could climb out of the sewer and duck into the rocket\r\nwhen nobody was looking. Once inside he was pretty sure he\'d find a\r\nplace to hide until blast-off.\r\n\r\nAll the men would probably be strapped in bunks but if he found a place\r\nhe could wedge himself in he didn\'t think he\'d get hurt. Then, halfway\r\nto the moon he would come out and find Dad and would he be surprised!\r\n\r\nAt first, thinking about it, he\'d been scared but after he realized how\r\nproud Dad and Mom would be, he made up his mind.\r\n\r\nNow, crouched beside the grating near the ship, he waited while two\r\nmen--technicians in white overalls--walked by.\r\n\r\nOne of them said, "Well, whatever happens, she\'ll make a big splash."\r\n\r\n"You said it. 

Hope the brains know what they\'re doing."\r\n\r\nThat made Bobby mad. Who said Dad didn\'t know what he was doing? Dad was\r\njust about the smartest scientist in the world.\r\n\r\nAfter the two men left he waited a long time. He heard voices but no one\r\ncame in sight. Taking a deep breath, he opened the grating and got out.\r\nIt was only four steps to the open port of the rocket. There was a\r\nlittle ramp they\'d used to roll things in and Bobby\'s feet touched it\r\nbut lightly as he jumped into the ship. He found himself in some kind of\r\na storeroom. It would be a good place to hide all right. It was full of\r\naluminum barrels all the same size. He found a space between two rows\r\nand sat down and got his breath back. 

It was very quiet around him.\r\nScary quiet. But he set his lips firmly.\r\n\r\nHe was going to the moon with Dad.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJohn Kendall was a little late that night. He kissed his wife and said,\r\n"Well, did you see the big sky rocket?"\r\n\r\n"How could I miss it, darling? 

Your supper is in the oven."\r\n\r\n"I could use a Martini first."\r\n\r\n"Coming right up."\r\n\r\nWhile Myra fixed the drink John lay back in his easy chair and closed\r\nhis eyes. "We\'d hoped to stage a little ceremony at the launching but\r\nWashington said no."\r\n\r\n"The Russians?"\r\n\r\n"The Eastern Coalition. It was a race. 

That was why it had to be so\r\nsecret. Washington said, light the fuse and fire the thing."\r\n\r\n"Is it still hush-hush?"\r\n\r\n"No. Not between us at least. We fired an explosion rocket at the moon.\r\nIt will hit in about an hour and telescopes will show a big purple spot\r\nwhen our explosives go off and throw dye all over the place."\r\n\r\nMyra handed him a dry Martini. 

"I see. 

Lots of fun no doubt but what\'s\r\nthe purpose? Fourth of July on the moon?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no. If the experiment is a success the next rocket will carry men\r\ninstead of a bomb."\r\n\r\nMyra went to the kitchen to see about supper. John called, "Where\'s\r\nBobby? In bed I suppose."\r\n\r\nMyra didn\'t hear and John set his drink down and moved toward the\r\nbedroom. Maybe he was still awake.\r\n\r\nBobby rolled over. His eyes popped open. 

"Dad! I thought you went to--"\r\n\r\nJohn Kendall sat down on the edge of the bed and tousled his son\'s hair.\r\n"No, son. It\'s the old _terra firma_ for me. Did you see the rocket\r\nblast?"\r\n\r\n"Uh-huh. It was really something. It went to the moon, didn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s right." 

Kendall smiled and thought. Try to keep a secret from\r\nthe kids. It just can\'t be done. "How\'s _your_ moon rocket coming along,\r\nson?"\r\n\r\n"Pretty good. Gee, Dad! As long as you didn\'t go, I\'m glad I didn\'t go\r\neither."\r\n\r\n"You were planning to make the trip also?"\r\n\r\n"Uh-huh. I got into the rocket and was all set but I got to thinking\r\nabout Mom--how one of us should stay and take care of her in case\r\nanything happened."\r\n\r\n"Smart thinking, son. Now you get to sleep. I\'ll have a little time\r\ntomorrow. We\'ll play some ball."\r\n\r\n"That will be keen!"\r\n\r\nJohn Kendall smiled as he left the bedroom. Kids were wonderful! Give\r\nthem a few old boards and a steering wheel and they could build a ship\r\nto fly to the moon. What a wonderful dream world they lived in!\r\n\r\nToo bad they had to grow out of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Imagination_ April 1956.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\xe2\x80\x99s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
