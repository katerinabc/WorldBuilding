]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Would it work? Yes. How would\r\n                   it work? Exactly  like  this.\r\n\r\n\r\n"No more lies," Paula said. "For God\'s sake, Doctor, no more lies. I\'ve\r\nbeen living with lies for the past year and I\'m tired of them."\r\n\r\nBernstein closed the white door before answering, mercifully obscuring\r\nthe sheeted, motionless mound on the hospital bed. He took the young\r\nwoman\'s elbow and walked with her down the tiled corridor.\r\n\r\n"He\'s dying, of course," he said conversationally. "We\'ve never lied to\r\nyou about that, Mrs. Hills; you know what we\'ve told you all along. I\r\nhoped that by now you\'d feel more resigned."\r\n\r\n"I was," she said bitterly. They had stopped in front of Bernstein\'s\r\nsmall office and she drew her arm away. "But then you called me. 

About\r\nthis drug of yours--"\r\n\r\n"We had to call you. Senopoline can\'t be administered without\r\npermission of the patient, and since your husband has been in coma for\r\nthe last four days--"\r\n\r\nHe opened the door and nodded her inside. She hesitated, then walked\r\nin. He took his place behind the cluttered desk, his grave face\r\ndistracted, and waited until she sat down in the facing chair. He\r\npicked up his telephone receiver, replaced it, shuffled papers, and\r\nthen locked his hands on the desk blotter.\r\n\r\n"Senopoline is a curious drug," he said. "I\'ve had little experience\r\nwith it myself. 

You may have heard about the controversy surrounding\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"No," she whispered. "I don\'t know about it. I haven\'t cared about\r\nanything since Andy\'s illness."\r\n\r\n"At any rate, you\'re the only person in the world that can decide\r\nwhether your husband receives it. It\'s strange stuff, as I said, but in\r\nthe light of your husband\'s present condition, I can tell you this--it\r\ncan do him absolutely no harm."\r\n\r\n"But it will do him good?"\r\n\r\n"There," Bernstein sighed, "is the crux of the controversy, Mrs.\r\nHills."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRow, row, row your boat, he sang in his mind, feeling the lapping\r\ntongues of the cool lake water against his fingers, drifting, drifting,\r\nunder obeisant willows. Paula\'s hands were resting gently on his eyes\r\nand he lifted them away. Then he kissed the soft palms and pressed them\r\non his cheek. When he opened his eyes, he was surprised to find that\r\nthe boat was a bed, the water only pelting rain against the window, and\r\nthe willow trees long shadows on the walls. Only Paula\'s hands were\r\nreal, solid and real and comforting against his face.\r\n\r\nHe grinned at her. "Funniest damn thing," he said. "For a minute there,\r\nI thought we were back at Finger Lake. Remember that night we sprang a\r\nleak? I\'ll never forget the way you looked when you saw the hem of your\r\ndress."\r\n\r\n"Andy," she said quietly. "Andy, do you know what\'s happened?"\r\n\r\nHe scratched his head. "Seems to me Doc Bernstein was in here a while\r\nago. Or was he? 

Didn\'t they jab me again or something?"\r\n\r\n"It was a drug, Andy. Don\'t you remember? They have this new miracle\r\ndrug, senopoline. Dr. 

Bernstein told you about it, said it was worth\r\nthe try...."\r\n\r\n"Oh, sure, I remember."\r\n\r\nHe sat up in bed, casually, as if sitting up in bed were an everyday\r\noccurrence. He took a cigarette from the table beside him and lit one.\r\nHe smoked reflectively for a moment, and then recalled that he hadn\'t\r\nbeen anything but horizontal for almost eight months. Swiftly, he put\r\nhis hand on his rib cage and touched the firm flesh.\r\n\r\n"The girdle," he said wonderingly. "Where the hell\'s the girdle?"\r\n\r\n"They took it off," Paula said tearfully. "Oh, Andy, they took it off.\r\nYou don\'t need it any more. You\'re healed, completely healed. 

It\'s a\r\nmiracle!"\r\n\r\n"A miracle...."\r\n\r\nShe threw her arms about him; they hadn\'t held each other since the\r\naccident a year ago, the accident that had snapped his spine in several\r\nplaces. He had been twenty-two when it happened.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey released him from the hospital three days later; after half a year\r\nin the hushed white world, the city outside seemed wildly clamorous and\r\nriotously colorful, like a town at the height of carnival. He had never\r\nfelt so well in his life; he was eager to put the strong springs of\r\nhis muscles back into play. Bernstein had made the usual speech about\r\nrest, but a week after his discharge Andy and Paula were at the courts\r\nin tennis clothes.\r\n\r\nAndy had always been a dedicated player, but his stiff-armed forehand\r\nand poor net game had always prevented him from being anything more\r\nthan a passable amateur. Now he was a demon on the court, no ball\r\nescaping his swift-moving racket. He astounded himself with the\r\naccuracy of his crashing serves, his incredible play at the net.\r\n\r\nPaula, a junior champion during her college years, couldn\'t begin to\r\ncope with him; laughingly, she gave up and watched him battle the club\r\nprofessional. He took the first set 6-0, 6-0, 6-0, and Andy knew that\r\nsomething more magical than medicinal had happened to him.\r\n\r\nThey talked it over, excited as schoolchildren, all the way home. Andy,\r\nwho had taken a job in a stock-brokerage house after college, and who\r\nhad been bored silly with the whole business until the accident, began\r\nwondering if he could make a career on the tennis court.\r\n\r\nTo make sure his superb playing wasn\'t a fluke, they returned to the\r\nclub the next day. This time, Andy found a former Davis Cup challenger\r\nto compete with. At the end of the afternoon, his heart pounding to\r\nthe beat of victory, he knew it was true.\r\n\r\nThat night, with Paula in his lap, he stroked her long auburn hair and\r\nsaid: "No, Paula, it\'s all wrong. I\'d like to keep it up, maybe enter\r\nthe Nationals, but that\'s no life for me. 

It\'s only a game, after all."\r\n\r\n"Only a game?" she said mockingly. "That\'s a fine thing for the next\r\ntop-seeded man to say."\r\n\r\n"No, I\'m serious. Oh, I don\'t mean I intend to stay in Wall Street;\r\nthat\'s not my ambition either. As a matter of fact, I was thinking of\r\npainting again."\r\n\r\n"Painting? You haven\'t painted since your freshman year. You think you\r\ncan make a living at it?"\r\n\r\n"I was always pretty good, you know that. I\'d like to try doing some\r\ncommercial illustration; that\'s for the bread and potatoes. Then, when\r\nwe don\'t have to worry about creditors, I\'d like to do some things on\r\nmy own.

"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t pull a Gauguin on me, friend." 

She kissed his cheek lightly.\r\n"Don\'t desert your wife and family for some Tahitian idyll...."\r\n\r\n"What family?"\r\n\r\nShe pulled away from him and got up to stir the ashes in the fireplace.\r\nWhen she returned, her face was glowing with the heat of the fire and\r\nwarmth of her news.\r\n\r\nAndrew Hills, Junior, was born in September. Two years later, little\r\nDenise took over the hand-me-down cradle. By that time, Andy Hills was\r\nsigning his name to the magazine covers of America\'s top-circulation\r\nweeklies, and they were happy to feature it. His added fame as\r\nAmerica\'s top-ranked amateur tennis champion made the signature all the\r\nmore desirable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Andrew Junior was three, Andrew Senior made his most important\r\nadvance in the field of art--not on the cover of the _Saturday Evening\r\nPost_, but in the halls of the Modern Museum of Art. His first exhibit\r\nevoked such a torrent of superlatives that the _New York Times_ found\r\nthe reaction newsworthy enough for a box on the front page. There was\r\na celebration in the Hills household that night, attended by their\r\nclosest friends: copies of slick magazines were ceremoniously burned\r\nand the ashes placed in a dime-store urn that Paula had bought for the\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nA month later, they were signing the documents that entitled them to a\r\nsprawling hilltop house in Westchester, with a north-light glassed-in\r\nstudio the size of their former apartment.\r\n\r\nHe was thirty-five when the urge struck him to rectify a sordid\r\npolitical situation in their town. His fame as an artist and\r\ntennis-champion (even at thirty-five, he was top-seeded in the\r\nNationals) gave him an easy entree into the political melee. At first,\r\nthe idea of vote-seeking appalled him; but he couldn\'t retreat once the\r\nmovement started. He won easily and was elected to the town council.\r\nThe office was a minor one, but he was enough of a celebrity to attract\r\ncountry-wide attention. During the following year, he began to receive\r\nvisits from important men in party circles; in the next state election,\r\nhis name was on the ballot. By the time he was forty, Andrew Hills was\r\na U.S. Senator.\r\n\r\nThat spring, he and Paula spent a month in Acapulco, in an enchanting\r\nhome they had erected in the cool shadows of the steep mountains that\r\nfaced the bay. It was there that Andy talked about his future.\r\n\r\n"I know what the party\'s planning," he told his wife, "but I know\r\nthey\'re wrong. I\'m not Presidential timber, Paula."\r\n\r\nBut the decision wasn\'t necessary; by summer, the Asiatic Alliance had\r\ntired of the incessant talks with the peacemakers and had launched\r\ntheir attack on the Alaskan frontier. Andy was commissioned at once as\r\na major.\r\n\r\nHis gallantry in action, his brilliant recapture of Shaktolik, White\r\nMountain, and eventual triumphant march into Nome guaranteed him a\r\nplace in the High Command of the Allied Armies.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the first year of fighting, there were two silver stars\r\non his shoulder and he was given the most critical assignment of\r\nall--to represent the Allies in the negotiations that were taking place\r\nin Fox Island in the Aleutians. Later, he denied that he was solely\r\nresponsible for the successful culmination of the peace talks, but\r\nthe American populace thought him hero enough to sweep him into the\r\nWhite House the following year in a landslide victory unparalleled in\r\npolitical history.\r\n\r\nHe was fifty by the time he left Washington, but his greatest triumphs\r\nwere yet to come. In his second term, his interest in the World\r\nOrganization had given him a major role in world politics. As First\r\nSecretary of the World Council, his ability to effect a working\r\ncompromise between the ideological factions was directly responsible\r\nfor the establishment of the World Government.\r\n\r\nWhen he was sixty-four, Andrew Hills was elected World President, and\r\nhe held the office until his voluntary retirement at seventy-five.\r\nStill active and vigorous, still capable of a commanding tennis game,\r\nof a painting that set art circles gasping, he and Paula moved\r\npermanently into the house in Acapulco.\r\n\r\nHe was ninety-six when the fatigue of living overtook him. Andrew\r\nJunior, with his four grandchildren, and Denise, with her charming\r\ntwins, paid him one last visit before he took to his bed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"But what _is_ the stuff?" 

Paula said. 

"Does it cure or what? I have a\r\nright to know!"\r\n\r\nDr. Bernstein frowned. "It\'s rather hard to describe. It has no\r\ncurative powers. It\'s more in the nature of a hypnotic drug, but it has\r\na rather peculiar effect. It provokes a dream."\r\n\r\n"A dream?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. An incredibly long and detailed dream, in which the patient lives\r\nan entire lifetime, and lives it just the way he would like it to be.\r\nYou might say it\'s an opiate, but the most humane one ever developed."\r\n\r\nPaula looked down at the still figure on the bed. His hand was moving\r\nslowly across the bed-sheet, the fingers groping toward her.\r\n\r\n"Andy," she breathed. "Andy darling...."\r\n\r\nHis hand fell across hers, the touch feeble and aged.\r\n\r\n"Paula," he whispered, "say good-by to the children for me."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE STUFF ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\xe2\x80\x99s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
