But right down the\r\n   road was the other town--and that was even worse!_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Sodom\r\n        and\r\n  Gomorrah,\r\n      Texas\r\n\r\n\r\n  By R. A. LAFFERTY\r\n\r\n  Illustrated by RITTER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nManuel shouldn\'t have been employed as a census taker. He wasn\'t\r\nqualified. 

He couldn\'t read a map. He didn\'t know what a map was. He\r\nonly grinned when they told him that North was at the top.\r\n\r\nHe knew better.\r\n\r\nBut he did write a nice round hand, like a boy\'s hand. He knew Spanish,\r\nand enough English. For the sector that was assigned to him he would not\r\nneed a map. He knew it better than anyone else, certainly better than\r\nany mapmaker. Besides, he was poor and needed the money.\r\n\r\nThey instructed him and sent him out. Or they thought that they had\r\ninstructed him. They couldn\'t be sure.\r\n\r\n"Count everyone? All right. Fill in everyone? I need more papers."\r\n\r\n"We will give you more if you need more. But there aren\'t so many in\r\nyour sector."\r\n\r\n"Lots of them. _Lobos_, _tejones_, _zorros_, even people."\r\n\r\n"Only the _people_, Manuel! Do not take the animals. How would you write\r\nup the animals? They have no names."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. All have names. Might as well take them all."\r\n\r\n"Only people, Manuel."\r\n\r\n"_Mulos?_"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"_Conejos?_"\r\n\r\n"No, Manuel, no. Only the people."\r\n\r\n"No trouble. Might as well take them all."\r\n\r\n"Only people--God give me strength!--only people, Manuel."\r\n\r\n"How about little people?"\r\n\r\n"Children, yes. That has been explained to you."\r\n\r\n"_Little_ people. Not children, little people."\r\n\r\n"If they are people, take them."\r\n\r\n"How big they have to be?"\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t make any difference how big they are. If they are people,\r\ntake them."\r\n\r\nThat is where the damage was done.\r\n\r\nThe official had given a snap judgement, and it led to disaster. It was\r\nnot his fault. 

The instructions are not clear. Nowhere in all the\r\nverbiage does it say how big they have to be to be counted as people.\r\n\r\n\r\nManuel took Mula and went to work. His sector was the Santa Magdalena, a\r\nscrap of bald-headed and desolate mountains, steep but not high, and so\r\ntorrid in the afternoons that it was said that the old lava sometimes\r\nbegan to writhe and flow again from the sun\'s heat alone.\r\n\r\nIn the center valley there were five thousand acres of slag and\r\nvitrified rock from some forgotten old blast that had melted the hills\r\nand destroyed their mantle, reducing all to a terrible flatness. This\r\nwas called Sodom. It was strewn with low-lying ghosts as of people and\r\nobjects, formed when the granite bubbled like water.\r\n\r\nAway from the dead center the ravines were body-deep in chaparral, and\r\nthe hillsides stood gray-green with old cactus. The stunted trees were\r\nlower than the giant bushes and yucca.\r\n\r\nManuel went with Mula, a round easy man and a sparse gaunt mule. Mula\r\nwas a mule, but there were other inhabitants of the Santa Magdalena of a\r\ngenus less certain.\r\n\r\nYet even about Mula there was an oddity in her ancestry. Her paternal\r\ngrandfather had been a goat. Manuel once told Mr. Marshal about this,\r\nbut Mr. Marshal had not accepted it.\r\n\r\n"She is a mule. Therefore, her father was a jack. Therefore his father\r\nwas also a jack, a donkey. It could not be any other way."\r\n\r\nManuel often wondered about that, for he had raised the whole strain of\r\nanimals, and he remembered who had been with whom.\r\n\r\n"A donkey! A jack! Two feet tall and with a beard and horns. I always\r\nthought that he was a goat."\r\n\r\nManuel and Mula stopped at noon on Lost Soul Creek. There would be no\r\ntravel in the hot afternoon. But Manuel had a job to do, and he did it.\r\nHe took the forms from one of the packs that he had unslung from Mula,\r\nand counted out nine of them. He wrote down all the data on nine people.\r\nHe knew all there was to know about them, their nativities and their\r\nantecedents. He knew that there were only nine regular people in the\r\nnine hundred square miles of the Santa Magdalena.\r\n\r\nBut he was systematic, so he checked the list over again and again.\r\nThere seemed to be somebody missing. Oh, yes, himself. He got another\r\nform and filled out all the data on himself.\r\n\r\nNow, in one way of looking at it, his part in the census was finished.\r\nIf only he had looked at it that way, he would have saved worry and\r\ntrouble for everyone, and also ten thousand lives. But the instructions\r\nthey had given him were ambiguous, for all that they had tried to make\r\nthem clear.\r\n\r\nSo very early the next morning he rose and cooked beans, and said,\r\n"Might as well take them all."\r\n\r\nHe called Mula from the thorn patch where she was grazing, gave her salt\r\nand loaded her again. Then they went to take the rest of the census, but\r\nin fear. There was a clear duty to get the job done, but there was also\r\na dread of it that his superiors did not understand. There was reason\r\nalso why Mula was loaded so she could hardly walk with packs of census\r\nforms.\r\n\r\nManuel prayed out loud as they climbed the purgatorial scarp above Lost\r\nSouls Creek, "_ruega por nosotros pecadores ahora_--" the very gulches\r\nstood angry and stark in the early morning--"_y en la hora de neustra\r\nmuerte._"\r\n\r\n\r\nThree days later an incredible dwarf staggered into the outskirts of\r\nHigh Plains, Texas, followed by a dying wolf-sized animal that did not\r\nlook like a wolf.\r\n\r\nA lady called the police to save the pair from rock-throwing kids who\r\nmight have killed them, and the two as yet unclassified things were\r\ntaken to the station house.\r\n\r\nThe dwarf was three foot high, a skeleton stretched over with\r\nbrown-burnt leather. The other was an un-canine looking dog-sized beast,\r\nso full of burrs and thorns that it might have been a porcupine. It was\r\na nightmare replica of a shrunken mule.\r\n\r\nThe midget was mad. The animal had more presence of mind: she lay down\r\nquietly and died, which was the best she could do, considering the state\r\nthat she was in.\r\n\r\n"Who is census chief now?" asked the mad midget. "Is Mr. Marshal\'s boy\r\nthe census chief?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Marshal is, yes. Who are you? How do you know Marshal? And what is\r\nthat which you are pulling out of your pants, if they are pants?"\r\n\r\n"Census list. Names of everybody in the Santa Magdalena. I had to steal\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"It looks like microfilm, the writing is so small. And the roll goes on\r\nand on. There must be a million names here."\r\n\r\n"Little bit more, little bit more. I get two bits a name."\r\n\r\nThey got Marshal there. He was very busy, but he came. He had been given\r\na deadline by the mayor and the citizen\'s group. He had to produce a\r\npopulation of ten thousand people for High Plains, Texas; and this was\r\ndifficult, for there weren\'t that many people in the town. He had been\r\nworking hard on it, though; but he came when the police called him.\r\n\r\n"You Marshal\'s little boy? You look just like your father," said the\r\nmidget.\r\n\r\n"That voice, I should know that voice even if it\'s cracked to pieces.\r\nThat has to be Manuel\'s voice."\r\n\r\n"Sure, I\'m Manuel. Just like I left, thirty-five years ago."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t be Manuel, shrunk three feet and two hundred pounds and aged\r\na million."\r\n\r\n"You look here at my census slip. It says I\'m Manuel. And here are nine\r\nmore of the regular people, and one million of the little people. I\r\ncouldn\'t get them on the right forms, though. 

I had to steal their\r\nlist."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t be Manuel," said Marshal.\r\n\r\n"He can\'t be Manuel," said the big policemen and the little policeman.\r\n\r\n"Maybe not, then," the dwarf conceded. "I thought I was, but I wasn\'t\r\nsure. 

Who am I then? Let\'s look at the other papers and see which one I\r\nam."\r\n\r\n"No, you can\'t be any of them either, Manuel. And you surely can\'t be\r\nManuel."\r\n\r\n"Give him a name anyhow and get him counted. We got to get to that ten\r\nthousand mark."\r\n\r\n"Tell us what happened, Manuel--if you are. Which you aren\'t. But tell\r\nus."\r\n\r\n"After I counted the regular people I went to count the little people. I\r\ntook a spade and spaded off the top of their town to get in. But they\r\nput an _encanto_ on me, and made me and Mula run a treadmill for\r\nthirty-five years."\r\n\r\n"Where was this?

"\r\n\r\n"At the little people town. Nuevo Danae. But after thirty-five years the\r\n_encanto_ wore off and Mula and I stole the list of names and ran away."\r\n\r\n"But where did you really get this list of so many names written so\r\nsmall?"\r\n\r\n"Suffering saddle sores, Marshal, don\'t ask the little bug so many\r\nquestions. You got a million names in your hand. 

Certify them! Send them\r\nin! There\'s enough of us here right now. We declare that place annexed\r\nforthwith. This will make High Plains the biggest town in the whole\r\nstate of Texas."\r\n\r\n\r\nSo Marshal certified them and sent them into Washington. This gave High\r\nPlains the largest percentage increase of any city in the nation, but it\r\nwas challenged. There were some soreheads in Houston who said that it\r\nwasn\'t possible. They said High Plains had nowhere near that many people\r\nand there must have been a miscount.\r\n\r\nAnd in the days that the argument was going on, they cleaned up and fed\r\nManuel, if it were he, and tried to get from him a cogent story.\r\n\r\n"How do you know it was thirty-five years you were on the treadmill,\r\nManuel?"\r\n\r\n"Well, it seemed like thirty-five years.

"\r\n\r\n"It could have only been about three days."\r\n\r\n"Then how come I\'m so old?"\r\n\r\n"We don\'t know that, Manuel, we sure don\'t know that. How big were these\r\npeople?"\r\n\r\n"Who knows? A finger long, maybe two?"\r\n\r\n"And what is their town?"\r\n\r\n"It is an old prairie-dog town that they fixed up. You have to dig down\r\nwith a spade to get to the streets."\r\n\r\n"Maybe they were really all prairie dogs, Manuel. Maybe the heat got you\r\nand you only dreamed that they were little people."\r\n\r\n"Prairie dogs can\'t write as good as on that list. Prairie dogs can\'t\r\nwrite hardly at all."\r\n\r\n"That\'s true. 

The list is hard to explain. And such odd names on it\r\ntoo."\r\n\r\n"Where is Mula? I don\'t see Mula since I came back."\r\n\r\n"Mula just lay down and died, Manuel."\r\n\r\n"Gave me the slip. Why didn\'t I think of that? 

Well, I\'ll do it too. I\'m\r\ntoo worn out for anything else."\r\n\r\n"Before you do, Manuel, just a couple of last questions."\r\n\r\n"Make them real fast then. I\'m on my way."\r\n\r\n"Did you know these little people were there before?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, sure. There a long time."\r\n\r\n"Did anybody else ever see them?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, sure. Everybody in the Santa Magdalena see them. Eight, nine people\r\nsee them."\r\n\r\n"And Manuel, how do we get to the place? 

Can you show us on a map?"\r\n\r\nManuel made a grimace, and died quietly as Mula had done. He didn\'t\r\nunderstand those maps at all, and took the easy way out.\r\n\r\nThey buried him, not knowing for sure whether he was Manuel come back,\r\nor what he was.\r\n\r\nThere wasn\'t much of him to bury.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the same night, very late and after he had been asleep, that\r\nMarshal was awakened by the ring of an authoritative voice. He was being\r\nharangued by a four-inch tall man on his bedside table, a man of\r\ndominating presence and acid voice.\r\n\r\n"Come out of that cot, you clown! Give me your name and station!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m Marshal, and I suspect that you are a late pig sandwich, or caused\r\nby one. I shouldn\'t eat so late."\r\n\r\n"Say \'sir\' when you reply to me. I am no pig sandwich and I do not\r\ncommonly call on fools. 

Get on your feet, you clod."\r\n\r\nAnd wonderingly Marshal did.\r\n\r\n"I want the list that was stolen. Don\'t gape! 

Get it!"\r\n\r\n"What list?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t stall, don\'t stutter. Get me our tax list that was stolen. It\r\nisn\'t words that I want from you.

"\r\n\r\n"Listen, you cicada, I\'ll take you and--"\r\n\r\n"You will not. You will notice that you are paralyzed from the neck\r\ndown. I suspect that you were always so from there up. 

Where is the\r\nlist?"\r\n\r\n"S-sent it to Washington."\r\n\r\n"You bug-eyed behemoth! Do you realize what a trip that will be? You\r\ngrandfather of inanities, it will be a pleasure to destroy you!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what you are, or if you are really. I don\'t believe that\r\nyou even belong on the world."\r\n\r\n"Not belong on the world! We own the world. We can show written title to\r\nthe world. Can you?"\r\n\r\n"I doubt it. Where did you get the title?"\r\n\r\n"None of your business. I\'d rather not say. Oh, well, we got it from a\r\npromoter of sorts. A con man, really. I\'ll have to admit that we were\r\ntaken, but we were in a spot and needed a world. He said that the larger\r\nbifurcates were too stupid to be a nuisance. We should have known that\r\nthe stupider a creature, the more of a nuisance it is."\r\n\r\n"I had about decided the same thing about the smaller a creature. We may\r\nhave to fumigate that old mountain mess."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you can\'t harm us. We\'re too powerful. But we can obliterate you in\r\nan instant."\r\n\r\n"Hah!"\r\n\r\n"Say \'Hah, _sir_\' when you address me. Do you know the place in the\r\nmountain that is called Sodom?"\r\n\r\n"I know the place. It was caused by a large meteor."\r\n\r\n"It was caused by one of these."\r\n\r\nWhat he held up was the size of a grain of sand. Marshal could not see\r\nit in detail.\r\n\r\n"There was another city of you bug-eyed beasts there," said the small\r\nmartinet. "You wouldn\'t know about it. 

It\'s been a few hundred years. We\r\ndecided it was too close. Now I have decided that you are too close."\r\n\r\n"A thing that size couldn\'t crack a walnut."\r\n\r\n"You floundering fop, it will blast this town flat!"\r\n\r\n"What will happen to you?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing. I don\'t even blink for things like that."\r\n\r\n"How do you trigger it off."\r\n\r\n"You gaping goof, I don\'t have time to explain that to you. 

I have to\r\nget to Washington."\r\n\r\nIt may be that Marshal did not believe himself quite awake. He certainly\r\ndid not take the threat seriously enough. For the little man did trigger\r\nit off.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the final count was in, High Plains did not have the highest\r\npercentage gain in population in the nation. Actually it showed the\r\nsharpest decline, from 7313 to nothing.\r\n\r\nThey were going to make a forest preserve out of the place, except that\r\nit has no trees worthy of the name. Now it is proposed to make it the\r\nSodom and Gomorrah State Park from the two mysterious scenes of\r\ndesolation there, just seven miles apart.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting place, as wild a region as you will ever find, and\r\nis recommended for the man who has seen everything.\r\n\r\n\r\n  --R.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\xe2\x80\x99s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
