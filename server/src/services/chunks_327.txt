Fear of his\r\n            awful power ... his twisted, mad brain. 

For one\r\n             day that brain would crack. When it did, the\r\n              World would dissolve in cataclysmic Chaos.\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n                      Planet Stories Spring 1940.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his little tower, perched at the very peak of the great terraced\r\npile of buildings which was his home and his citadel, Peter Groff sat\r\nbrooding with hatred. The city, its factories, its vast plowed fields,\r\nlay stretched below him. Millions of humans, at play in little games.\r\nHow he hated them! And they hated him--hated and feared him. It made\r\nhim chuckle. For all his life he had worked and schemed and fought to\r\nmake himself a power. The richest, most powerful man in the world--he\r\nhad attained it. They had called him cruel, in his youth, with his\r\nruthless business methods. He had laughed. Then they had no longer\r\ndared call him anything which would anger him. And he had laughed at\r\nthat, while he had bought their governments and their armies with his\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nHe was laughing now as he thought of it. In seventy years he had made\r\nthe name Peter Groff a thing at which to tremble. Over all the earth,\r\nfrom the heads of his groveling puppet governments down to the lowliest\r\nchild driving a plow in the fields, there was no one who did not\r\nsecretly fear Groff, the power of his money, the sound of anger in his\r\nvoice. Here in his citadel his servants trembled--and hated him. It was\r\nfunny, because by their methods they had gotten nothing; and he had\r\ngotten everything.\r\n\r\nAlone in his little tower, he sat and brooded. There was little else\r\nto do now, and he enjoyed it--this contemplation of himself and his\r\nachievements. The mirror beside which he sat reflected his image. He\r\nstared at himself. His trusted companion. His face, thin-lipped, was\r\ngrim with its power. His eyes gleamed with it--eyes at which everyone\r\nshivered with fear. The banked rows of his television tuning knobs were\r\nwithin reach of his hand. And he decided that it would be amusing to\r\nlook and to listen from some of the newscasters\' vantage points at what\r\nwas transpiring down in the city streets. He chose one in the factory\r\ndistrict, over by the river. They were the people who had least.\r\n\r\nThe little cathode mirror presently was glowing with the scene he\r\nhad selected. It was a tube-lit city arcade, far down by the lowest\r\nlevel of the Inter-urban railway. Subterranean shops were along its\r\nsides--places where people with the tiniest fraction of money might\r\nspend it for something which wasn\'t worth having.\r\n\r\nAnd as he stared, from one of the shops a young couple came--a\r\ndark-haired, slender young man and a girl who was pretty, and who was\r\nlaughing. They were poorly dressed. They had nothing. But they were\r\nlaughing; and suddenly they were struggling as the young man fastened\r\nupon the girl\'s dress the bauble he had bought, and then was trying to\r\nkiss her for his payment. The scuffle was over in a moment; and Groff\r\nheard from his microphone the girl\'s gasping, murmured words:\r\n\r\n"Oh, Jac--I\'m so happy--"\r\n\r\nGroff stiffened. His thin, lined face was grim as he reached and cut\r\noff the image and the murmuring voice....\r\n\r\nSomething happened to Peter Groff that summer night. He wasn\'t\r\nconscious of it; he only knew that he was enraged as though an attack\r\nhad been made upon him. 

Atrocious things which menaced him needed\r\ncrushing. He pondered it, grim with his planning....\r\n\r\nNear dawn, some of his servants knew that something had happened. They\r\nheard him, with his wild laughter coming in an eerie muffled blur from\r\nhis little tower. Then young Peller dared go up to see what might be\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\n"Is there anything you need of me, Master?" he asked.\r\n\r\nGroff was staring from his great armchair. "Not now, Peller. But I\'ve\r\njust discovered how to solve the situation very quickly. The Master has\r\njust made up his mind, Peller."\r\n\r\nIt was gratifying to see the terror and confusion on Peller\'s face.\r\nGroff\'s gesture drove the servant away, so that he would go down into\r\nthe corridors of the citadel and whisper with all the other servants as\r\nthey trembled, thinking the Master might be displeased with them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe thing took Groff more than a year. The thousands of men whom he\r\nsent secretly throughout the world did as he commanded, and did not\r\nknow why they were doing it. Poor fools. The great scientist who for so\r\nmany years had been in Groff\'s employ gave him the technical knowledge\r\nhe sought. Fools. 

All fools. They could not guess what he was really\r\nafter. The lies he told them which awakened their cupidity were so easy\r\nfor them to believe. No servant could know what any other servant was\r\ndoing. No one could piece it together. There was only the masterful\r\nGroff in his tower weaving the poisonous threads of his gigantic\r\nenterprise into a pattern which only himself could see.\r\n\r\nThen at last he was ready. He had tracked down the identity of the\r\ndark-haired, slender young worker whom the laughing girl had called\r\nJac. And there came the momentous night when he sent for the young man\r\nand the girl, and white-faced, frightened, they stood before him in his\r\nlittle tower.\r\n\r\nGroff lolled back in his big chair as he quietly regarded them. "Quite\r\nan honor for you, isn\'t it?" 

he said. 

"Seeing me in person."\r\n\r\n"What do you want of us?" the young man murmured.\r\n\r\nIt was pleasing to Groff, to see his terror. "I wanted to thank you,"\r\nGroff said ironically. "It happened that I saw you two, one night about\r\na year ago. You made me realize what I must do. 

So I thought I would\r\ntell you about it."\r\n\r\nThey could only stand wordless, frightened. Groff sucked in his breath\r\nwith anticipatory pleasure. In a moment now they would be more than\r\nfrightened; they would be utterly terrified--and their terror would\r\nspread like a wave around the world.\r\n\r\nGroff was lashing himself into grim anger. "You are going to die," he\r\nsaid. At the girl\'s sudden little whimpering gasp he raised his hand.\r\n"That sort of think won\'t help you any. You and everyone on earth--this\r\nis your last night of health. Tomorrow, at dawn, you will all start\r\nswiftly to sicken. In a week, a month--you will be dead."\r\n\r\nHow well they knew that his threats were never empty. They were huddled\r\ntogether now, with trembling arms around each other as they stared\r\nat him. He lashed himself further into anger as he told them that he\r\nrealized how millions of people were conspiring to the end that Groff\r\nmight suffer misfortune. A menace which he could no longer tolerate....\r\nHow those millions would squirm as they saw death coming upon them! The\r\nsupreme power of Groff at last demonstrated to its ultimate. Queer that\r\nhe had never thought of this logical climax to his great career--not\r\nuntil that little incident a year ago when this young couple had caused\r\nhim to envisage it.\r\n\r\nHe was telling them now what he had done.... The little depots all\r\nover the earth, compressed with caged bacteria. Little time-bombs--all\r\nto explode within thirty minutes of this present instant. The women\r\nand children, the aged, would die first. But the polluted air, the\r\ncontagion spreading everywhere--in a week, a month, the swift and\r\ndeadly bacteria would leave no one alive.\r\n\r\n"You--are going to do this to us?" young Jac murmured at last.\r\n\r\n"Why not? 

It is my destiny." Never had Groff felt so quiet and\r\ncomfortable a thrill as now; and this was only the beginning. "Others\r\nbefore me have tried their little conquests," he said with his grim\r\nsmile. "Men who wanted power, and got it, just in a small way and for\r\na little while. There was one--I recall reading about him--one who was\r\nso foolish to disclose all his plans by writing them in a book, years\r\nbefore he had a chance to accomplish them. I am not like him. 

I tell\r\nyou now, when there is a scant thirty minutes before your inevitable\r\nannihilation begins."\r\n\r\n"You hate your fellow men so much," Jac murmured impulsively, "you\r\nwould kill yourself, just for the pleasure of killing the rest of us?"\r\n\r\nTo die. It sent so strangely a queer little shiver over Groff. He had\r\nalways felt it; but no one could ever know it, save himself. How many\r\ntimes his vaunted reckless bravery had awed his fellow man! He sat very\r\nstraight now, and his eyes flashed.\r\n\r\n"I have never been one to fear death," he said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut, as always before, he knew now that he was safe enough. His armed\r\ncitadel here was wholly safe from outside attack, even if the stricken\r\nmultitudes should find brief strength to try and assail him. His\r\nretainers, thinking they were safe, would remain at their posts. Poor\r\nfools. 

At the last, even they would be stricken and Groff would retreat\r\nup here. Impregnable, here in the tower and its neighbor little rooms,\r\nhe could maintain his unpolluted air, and eat the food and drink the\r\nwater which he had stored here in such abundance. Perhaps even, nature\r\nwould let him live the longer for his isolation.\r\n\r\nMaster of the earth. The man who owned everything. Pride swelled him\r\nagain as he thought of that poor little fool who had only wanted to\r\nmake himself the titular leader of the earth, and in his own fatuous\r\nconceit had written it all down in his little book.\r\n\r\n"You have good reason to fear me," Groff said. "You realize it now?

"\r\n\r\nThe young couple were white-faced and trembling as they clung to each\r\nother. And suddenly the girl murmured,\r\n\r\n"I--I pity you."\r\n\r\nGroff caught at it, with his sudden wild rage flooding him. "You lie!"\r\nhe rasped. "You are frightened. You are terrified of me and my revenge."\r\n\r\n"Revenge?" young Jac muttered. "I wonder what we have done to\r\nyou--except that we live and breathe and try to be happy." His arm held\r\nthe trembling girl closer; and he turned and gazed into her face, her\r\nmoist red lips quivering, her eyes like misted stars as she regarded\r\nhim. "If we are both to die," he murmured, "still we will have each\r\nother, Manya."\r\n\r\n"Yes," she whispered.\r\n\r\nThen it seemed that the youth was not quite so afraid as he\r\nstraightened and fronted Groff. "Your revenge, when you kill us both,\r\nis not quite complete," he said with a twisted smile.\r\n\r\nThey turned at Groff\'s gesture of dismissal. At the head of the great\r\nstaircase which went down from the tower, dominant with his power,\r\nGroff stood with his heavy ornamented robe tossed over one shoulder and\r\nall his emblazoned insignia dangling on his chest. The young couple\r\nwere still clinging to each other as they descended. Then they were a\r\nlittle blob, dwarfed by distance, dwindling into total insignificance.\r\nIt was only a trick of lighting of the great staircase, of course;\r\nbut suddenly, just before they vanished, it seemed that the light had\r\nmagnified them into something gigantic....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe thing was over at last. It was a week? 

Two weeks? Three weeks?\r\nGroff had kept no track of the time. Exhausted with exulting he lay\r\nback in his chair with his instruments around him. How wonderful it\r\nhad been. The ultimate conquest. The power of Groff and Groff alone.\r\nSo many times it had made him think of those other conquerors--those\r\nlittle men of history who had been thrilled by their trips of triumph\r\ninto some petty land their armies had devastated. That little man in\r\nhis aircar, gazing in triumph, swelling himself with his pride as he\r\ngazed at the death and destruction he had brought to just one petty\r\nnation in three weeks....\r\n\r\nGroff\'s triumph was over now. He had seen much of it, with his\r\ntelescopes ranging the city, and on his television mirrors before the\r\ntelevision went blank. It had been queer, how people, stricken so that\r\nthey knew they had only a few days to live, had rushed around bringing\r\ntheir families together. Queer that then they had not really seemed\r\nafraid. Queer how the churches had been crowded, with doomed people who\r\nclung together and had a strange look on their faces as though they\r\nwere not afraid to die....\r\n\r\nThen it was over. From the immense height and safety of his little\r\ntower Groff sat surveying his conquered world. The man who had\r\neverything. The ultimate of personal power. And what would he do with\r\nit now? Queer thought! It was so queer, so whimsical a thought that he\r\nchuckled, and then was laughing at it--laughing for so long that it\r\nleft him breathless. There was nobody here to hate. That was another\r\nqueer thought.\r\n\r\nWas it days, or weeks or years, that now he sat alone in his little\r\ntower, surveying his empty world? There was nothing to do but\r\ngloat with pride at the greatness of himself; and to laugh at the\r\nwhimsicality of his hungry need to be angry at his enemies who now did\r\nnot exist. He had tired of that. Then there were times when he thought\r\nit would be satisfying if he killed himself, like the man who had\r\nwritten the book and who could not live when he realized that the time\r\nhad come when no one feared him. But Groff found that he had not the\r\ncourage to do that.\r\n\r\nIt tired him to laugh so much, so that often now he sat, just anguished\r\nwith emptiness. It was queer how that vision of the young couple\r\ngoing down his staircase seemed always here to haunt and to puzzle\r\nhim. 

What had been about them that was so gigantic? The thought\r\nenraged him, because he knew now that it was something he might have\r\nwanted--something he had failed to get.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s The Man Who Killed the Earth, by Ray King\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MAN WHO KILLED THE WORLD ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\xe2\x80\x99s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
