Holloway, but the press and\r\nthe public called her Big Joe. Her captain, six-star Admiral Heselton,\r\nthought of her as Great Big Joe, and never fully got over being\r\nawestruck at the size of his command.\r\n\r\n"She\'s a mighty big ship, Rogers," he said proudly to the navigator,\r\nignoring the latter\'s rather vacant stare and fixed smile. 

"More than a\r\nmile long, and wider than hell." 

He waved his hands expansively. "She\'s\r\nnever touched down on Earth, you know. Never will. Too big for that.\r\nThey built her on the moon. 

The cost? Well ..."\r\n\r\nSwiveling his chair around, Heselton slowly surveyed the ship\'s control\r\nroom with a small, satisfied smile. The two pilots sitting far forward,\r\nalmost hidden by their banks of instruments, the radar operators idly\r\nwatching their scopes, the three flight engineers sitting intently at\r\ntheir enormous control consoles, and, just behind, the radio shack--its\r\nclosed door undoubtedly hiding a game of cards. For weeks now, as Big\r\nJoe moved across the galaxy\'s uncharted fringe, the radio bands had been\r\ncompletely dead, except, of course, for the usual star static hissing\r\nand burbling in the background.\r\n\r\nTurning back again to his navigator, Heselton smiled modestly and noted\r\nthat Big Joe was undisputedly the largest, most powerful, most feared,\r\nand most effective spaceship in the known universe.\r\n\r\nAs always, Rogers nodded agreement. The fact that he\'d heard it a\r\nhundred times didn\'t make it any less true. Big Joe, armed with every\r\nweapon known to Terran technology, was literally the battleship to end\r\nall battleships. Ending battleships--and battles--was, in fact, her job.\r\nAnd she did it well. For the first time, the galaxy was at peace.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith a relaxed sigh, Heselton leaned back to gaze at the stars and\r\ncontemplate the vastness of the universe, compared to which even Big Joe\r\nwas an insignificant dot.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Rogers, "time for another course check. I\'ll ..." He jumped\r\nback, barely avoiding the worried lieutenant who exploded upon them from\r\nthe radio shack.\r\n\r\n"A signal, sir! Damn close, on the VHF band, their transmission is\r\ncompletely overriding the background noise." He waved excitedly to\r\nsomeone in the radio shack and an overhead speaker came to life emitting\r\na distinct clacking-grunting sound. 

"It\'s audio of some sort, sir, but\r\nthere\'s lots more to the signal than that."\r\n\r\nIn one motion Heselton\'s chair snapped forward, his right fist hit the\r\nred emergency alert button on his desk, and his left snapped on the\r\nship\'s intercom. Lights dimmed momentarily as powerful emergency drive\r\nunits snapped into action, and the ship echoed with the sound of two\r\nthousand men running to battle stations.\r\n\r\n"Bridge to radar! Report."\r\n\r\n"Radar to bridge. All clear."\r\n\r\nHeselton stared incredulously at the intercom. "What?"\r\n\r\n"Radar to bridge, repeating. All clear. Admiral, we\'ve got two men on\r\nevery scope, there\'s nothing anywhere."\r\n\r\nA new voice cut in on the speaker. 

"Radio track to bridge."\r\n\r\nFrowning, Heselton answered. "Bridge. Come in radio track. We\'re\r\nlistening."\r\n\r\n"Sir," the crisp voice of the radio track section\'s commander had an\r\nexcited tinge. "Sir, Doppler calculations show that the source of those\r\nsignals is slowing down somewhere to our right. It\'s acting like a\r\nspaceship, sir, that\'s coming to a halt."\r\n\r\nThe admiral locked eyes with Rogers for a second, then shrugged. "Slow\r\nthe ship, and circle right. Radio track, can you keep me posted on the\r\nobject\'s position?"\r\n\r\n"No can do, sir. Doppler effect can\'t be used on a slow moving source.\r\nIt\'s still off to our right, but that\'s the best I can say."\r\n\r\n"Sir," another voice chimed in, "this is fire control. We\'ve got our\r\ndirectional antennas on the thing. It\'s either directly right or\r\ndirectly left of the ship, matching speed with us exactly."\r\n\r\n"_Either_ to our right or left?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s the best we can do, sir, without radar help."\r\n\r\n"Admiral, sir," the lieutenant who had first reported the signal came\r\nrunning back. "Judging from the frequency and strength, we think it\'s\r\nprobably less than a hundred miles away."\r\n\r\n"_Less_ than a hundr ..."\r\n\r\n"Of course, we can\'t be positive, sir."\r\n\r\nHeselton whirled back to the intercom. "Radar! That thing is practically\r\non our necks. What the hell\'s the matter with that equipment...?"\r\n\r\nThe radar commander\'s voice showed distinct signs of strain. "Can\'t help\r\nit, Admiral. The equipment is working perfectly. We\'ve tried the\r\ncomplete range of frequencies, twenty-five different sets are in\r\noperation, we\'re going blind looking. There is absolutely nothing,\r\nnothing at all."\r\n\r\nFor a moment the bridge was silent, except for the clacking-grunting\r\nfrom the overhead speaker which, if anything, sounded louder than\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n"It\'s tv, sir!" The radio lieutenant came running in again. "We\'ve\r\nunscrambled the image. 

Here!" The communications screen on Heselton\'s\r\ndesk glowed for a moment, then flashed into life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe figure was clearly alien, though startlingly humanoid--at least from\r\nthe waist up, which was all that showed in the screen. A large mouth and\r\nslightly bulging eyes gave it a somewhat jovial, frog-like demeanor.\r\nSeated at a desk similar to Heselton\'s, wearing a gaudy uniform\r\nprofusely strewn with a variety of insignia, it was obviously Heselton\'s\r\ncounterpart, the commander of an alien vessel.\r\n\r\n"Hmmm, looks like we\'ve contacted a new race. Let\'s return the call,\r\nLieutenant." A tiny red light glowed beneath a miniature camera on\r\nHeselton\'s desk and almost at once the alien\'s face registered obvious\r\nsatisfaction. It waved a six-fingered hand in an unorthodox, but\r\nfriendly, greeting.\r\n\r\nHeselton waved back.\r\n\r\nThe alien then pointed to his mouth, made several clacking-grunting\r\nsounds, and moved a hand on his desk. The scene switched to another\r\nalien standing in front of what looked like a blackboard, with a piece\r\nof chalk in his hand. The meaning was clear.\r\n\r\n"Lieutenant, have this transmission switched to the linguistics section.\r\nMaybe those guys can work some sort of language." The screen blanked\r\nout. Heselton leaned back, tense, obviously worried. Hesitantly, he\r\nreached out and touched a button on the intercom.\r\n\r\n"Astronomy."\r\n\r\n"Professor, there\'s a ship right next door somewhere that should stand\r\nout like King Kong in a kindergarten."\r\n\r\n"I know, Admiral. 

I\'ve been listening to the intercom. Our optical\r\nequipment isn\'t designed for close range work, but we\'ve been doing the\r\nbest we can, tried everything from infra-red through ultra-violet. If\r\nthere is a ship out there I\'m afraid it\'s invisible."\r\n\r\nBeads of sweat sprinkled Heselton\'s forehead. "This is bad, Rogers.\r\nMighty bad." Nervously, he walked across to the right of the bridge and\r\nstood, hands clasped behind his back, staring blankly out at blackness\r\nand the scattered stars. "I know there is a ship out there, and I know\r\nthat a ship simply can\'t be invisible, not to radar _and_ optics."\r\n\r\n"What makes you sure there is only one, sir?"\r\n\r\nHeselton cracked his fists together. "My God, Rogers, you\'re right!\r\nThere might be ..."\r\n\r\nThe intercom clacked. "This is fire control again, sir. I think we\'ve\r\ngot something on the radiation detectors."\r\n\r\n"Good work, what did you find?"\r\n\r\n"Slight radioactivity, typical of interstellar drive mechanisms,\r\nsomewhere off to our right. Can\'t tell exactly where, though."\r\n\r\n"How far away is it?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, sir."\r\n\r\nHeselton\'s hands dropped to his sides. 

"Thanks," he said, "for the\r\nhelp."\r\n\r\nHis desk tv flashed into life with a picture of the smiling alien\r\ncommander. "This is the linguistics section, Admiral. The aliens\r\nunderstand a fairly common galactic symbology, I believe we can\r\ntranslate simple messages for you now."\r\n\r\n"Ask him where the hell he is," Heselton snapped without thinking, then\r\ninstantly regretted it as the alien\'s face showed unmistakable surprise.\r\n\r\nThe alien\'s smile grew into an almost unbelievable grin. He turned\r\nsideways to speak to someone out of sight of the camera and suddenly\r\nburst into a series of roaring cackles. "He\'s laughing, sir." The\r\ntranslator commented unnecessarily.\r\n\r\nThe joke was strictly with the aliens. Heselton\'s face whitened in quick\r\nrealization. "Rogers! They _didn\'t know_ that we can\'t see them!

"\r\n\r\n"Look, sir." The navigator pointed to the tv screen and a brilliantly\r\nclear image of Big Joe shimmering against the galaxy, lit by millions of\r\nstars. Every missile port, even the military numerals along her nose\r\nwere clearly visible.\r\n\r\n"They\'re rubbing it in, Rogers. Showing us what we look like to them.

"\r\nHeselton\'s face was chalk. "They could blast Big Joe apart, piece by\r\npiece--the most powerful ship in the galaxy."\r\n\r\n"Maybe," said Rogers, "the second most powerful."\r\n\r\nWithout answering, Heselton turned and looked out again at empty space\r\nand millions of steady, unwinking stars. His mind formed an image of a\r\nhuge, ethereal spaceship, missile ports open, weapons aimed directly at\r\nBig Joe.\r\n\r\nThe speaker interrupted his nightmare. "This is fire control, Admiral.\r\nWith your permission I\'ll scatter a few C-bombs ..."\r\n\r\nHeselton leaped for the microphone. "Are you out of your mind? We\r\nhaven\'t the slightest idea of the forces that guy has. We might be in\r\nthe center of a whole blooming fleet. 

Ever think of that?"\r\n\r\nThe alien\'s face, still smirking, appeared again on the screen. "He\r\nsays," said the interpreter, "that he finds the presence of our armed\r\nship very annoying."\r\n\r\nHeselton knew what he had to do. "Tell him," he said, swallowing hard,\r\n"that we apologize. This part of the galaxy is strange to us."\r\n\r\n"He says he is contemplating blasting us out of the sky."\r\n\r\nHeselton said nothing, but he longed to reach out and throttle the\r\ngrinning, alien face.\r\n\r\n"However," the interpreter continued, "he will let us go safely if we\r\nleave immediately. He says to send an unarmed, diplomatic vessel next\r\ntime and maybe his people will talk to us."\r\n\r\n"Thank him for his kindness." Heselton\'s jaws clenched so tightly they\r\nached.\r\n\r\n"He says," said the interpreter, "to get the hell out."\r\n\r\nThe grinning face snapped off the screen, but the cackling laughter\r\ncontinued to reverberate in the control room until the radio shack\r\nfinally turned off the receiver.\r\n\r\n"Reverse course," the admiral ordered quietly. "Maximum drive."\r\n\r\nA thousand missile launchers, designed to disintegrate solar systems,\r\nwere deactivated, hundreds of gyros swung the mile-long ship end for end\r\nand stabilized her on a reverse course, drive units big enough to power\r\nseveral major cities whined into operation, anti-grav generators with\r\nthe strength to shift small planets counterbalanced the external\r\nacceleration, and the ship moved, away, with a speed approaching that of\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n"Well," muttered Heselton, "that\'s the very first time Big Joe has ever\r\nhad to retreat." As if it were his own personal failure, he walked\r\nslowly across the control room and down the corridor towards his cabin.\r\n\r\n"Admiral!" Lost in thought, Heselton barely heard the call.\r\n\r\n"Admiral, look!" Pausing at the door to his cabin, Heselton turned to\r\nface the ship\'s chief astronomer running up waving two large\r\nphotographs.\r\n\r\n"Look, sir," the professor gasped for breath. "We thought this was a\r\nspot on the negative, but one of the men got curious and enlarged it\r\nabout a hundred times." He held up one of the photos. It showed a small,\r\nfuzzy, but unmistakable spaceship. "No wonder we couldn\'t spot it with\r\nour instruments."\r\n\r\nHeselton snatched it out of his hand. 

"I see what you mean. This ship\r\nmust have been thousands of miles ..."\r\n\r\nThe professor shook his head. "No, sir. As a matter of fact, it was\r\nquite close by."\r\n\r\n"But ..."\r\n\r\n"We figure that the total length of the alien ship was roughly an inch\r\nand a half."\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Science Fiction Stories_\r\n    January 1960.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\xe2\x80\x99s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
