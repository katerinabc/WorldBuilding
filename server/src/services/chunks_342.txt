]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis section of New Sante Fe was off my beaten track. I\'ve been on Mars\r\na long time and am more than usually familiar with the various centers\r\nwhere we Terrans do our congregating. However, it\'d been years since\r\nI\'d come through here.\r\n\r\nI was sitting in an obscure tavern, called, with commendable restraint,\r\nsimply Sam\'s Bar, lapping up Martian brandy and facing the prospect of\r\nreturning to the spaceport in a few hours with no particular enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nI only half-noticed the old man who got up on the stool next to me. Sam\r\ncame over and asked him what he\'d have.\r\n\r\nThe oldster carefully counted out some coins on the bar and said,\r\n"Wine, Sam; a glass of Martian wine."\r\n\r\n"You know I don\'t want your money, Joseph," Sam told him.\r\n\r\nThe old man answered reproachfully, "The wine would taste that much the\r\nless, my friend, if I had not earned it by the sweat of my...."\r\n\r\n"Okay," Sam sighed. He poured the wine and rang up the money and went\r\noff to wait on someone else.\r\n\r\nA halftripper sidled up to me. "How about a drink, spaceman?" 

he\r\nwhined. "I\'m a graduate of the academy myself, class of \'72." He must\r\nhave noted my United Space Lines uniform.\r\n\r\n"Sorry," I said gruffly, keeping my back to him. Any spaceman can tell\r\nyou that if you talk to a halftripper for long you\'ll soon be showing\r\nsymptoms of space cafard yourself. The underlying terror in him; the\r\nmind shattering fear of space; the way he stares at you, thinking that\r\nyou can go home, while he is afraid to risk the trip. There are few of\r\nthem that can hide their disease.\r\n\r\n"I need a shot bad," he whispered urgently. He probably did, too. Few\r\nhalftrippers are able to secure jobs on the planets of their exile.\r\nMost of them become beachcombers of space. Of course, there are some\r\nexceptions, especially if they have money and connections.\r\n\r\nI shuddered. "Beat it," I grated, hating myself and him.\r\n\r\nThe fear of space cafard must be somewhat similar to that of\r\nseasickness every new sailor had back in ancient days when man sailed\r\nthe oceans of Terra. He never knew until he made his first voyage if he\r\nwas going to be susceptible; and, if he turned out to be, it meant the\r\nsea wasn\'t for him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf course, space cafard goes tragically further. A new man usually\r\nsuccumbs his first few hours in space, if he is going to get it at\r\nall. He probably makes it to the next planet, sometimes not; sometimes\r\nhe goes incurably mad, right off the bat. But even if he does make\r\nit, wild horses could never get him on another rocketship. He becomes\r\na halftripper, marooned on an alien world. Usually, although I have\r\nknown of several exceptions, if you don\'t get it on your first trip, it\r\nseldom bothers you; you\'re immune for the rest of your life.\r\n\r\nHe repeated, "How about it, spaceman?"\r\n\r\nSam began to approach threateningly. 

He couldn\'t afford to have\r\nhalftrippers hang out in his place. For one thing, the shipping lines\r\nwould soon declare him out of bounds for their crews. You just can\'t\r\nlet good men come in contact with obvious victims of space cafard.\r\n\r\nThe old-timer Sam had called Joseph was distressed. "You know not what\r\nyou say," he told me gently.\r\n\r\nI managed a sneer. "Am I supposed to buy a drink for every spacebum\r\nthat comes along?"\r\n\r\nThe halftripper\'s eyes lit up and he came closer to the old man. "How\r\nabout it, pop? Could you loan me the price of a nip of woji?"\r\n\r\nJoseph\'s face was compassionate. "I am sorry, brother, I myself have\r\nnothing, but I commend you to the generosity of the tavern keeper."\r\n\r\nI snorted at that. I could imagine how much generosity the space leper\r\nwould get from the bartender.\r\n\r\nThat\'s where the surprise came. Sam sighed. "Okay, halftripper, what\'ll\r\nit be?"\r\n\r\nThe spacebum ordered a double woji, got it down quickly, as though he\r\nwas afraid Sam might change his mind, and then beat it to find a place\r\nto have his dreams when the full force of the also-narcotic drink hit\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nI finished my brandy, ordered another, and grinned wryly at the\r\nold-timer. "You give me kert for telling him to beat it, but you give\r\nSam the high sign to let him have woji with which to rot out his\r\nbrains. 

I\'d think I was being the kinder of the two of us."\r\n\r\n"Each man\'s salvation is within himself," Joseph said softly. "You\r\nwon\'t redeem him by attempting to keep him from his weaknesses."\r\n\r\n"You talk like a saint but I notice you\'re sitting here at a bar."\r\n\r\nHe looked at me penetratingly, and there was vast emptiness behind\r\nhis eyes. "There is little to enjoy in life," he said softly, "but\r\nI have had ample time to investigate all of the supposed pleasures.\r\nAt one time I drank greatly and kept myself in a state of continual\r\nintoxication for a period longer than you could believe. Then I went\r\nthrough a state when I let nothing pass my lips but water. Now I see\r\nthe mistake of both extremes and can enjoy an occasional glass without\r\nfeeling the need of swilling it down until intoxication dulls me."\r\n\r\nHe had me interested now. I said, "You sound as though you\'ve found the\r\nway in which to get the greatest satisfaction from everything in life\r\nbut I notice that you don\'t appear particularly happy."\r\n\r\nHe was silent for a long time. Finally he sighed and answered,\r\n"Happiness is not to be found in wine, nor in food, nor in beautiful\r\nwomen, nor even in wealth and power. It is from within, what you have\r\ndone, what you are in the eyes of your fellow man."\r\n\r\nHe looked as though he was about to say more, but he fell silent, his\r\neyes on something far away, although he seemed to be looking directly\r\ninto my face. Then a light returned to them and he came back to our\r\nconversation. "I am sorry," he said. "For a moment you reminded me of\r\nsomeone I knew long and long ago. But now I must be on my way." He left\r\nhis drink half-finished on the bar and walked wearily to the door.\r\n\r\nSam took his glass away and wiped the bar reflectively. "Whenever\r\nhe\'s here, I can\'t turn down any halftrippers or other spacebums," he\r\ncomplained. "I tried it once, and the old boy looked so pathetic that I\r\ndamn near cried myself."\r\n\r\n"He seems to be quite a character," I said, only half-interested.\r\n\r\n"Sure," Sam said. "Haven\'t you heard about Joseph? He\'s immortal."\r\n\r\n"What?" I said, startled.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Immortal. You know, he lives forever." He poured me another brandy and\r\nleaned on the bar. His other customers had left and he was obviously in\r\nthe mood for talking.\r\n\r\n"I thought everybody knew about Joseph," he went on. "He was one of the\r\nfirst spacebarons, a real bigshot, controlled the whole of Calypso; him\r\nand his brother. They not only personally owned all of the satellite,\r\nbut even all of the space lines that served it. When it came to law\r\nthere, he was judge, jury, and owner of the courthouse and jail.\r\nBrother, that was one monopoly."\r\n\r\n"You mean that old man that was just here?" 

I said in amazement.\r\n\r\n"That\'s right. Joseph, we call him now. He probably had a longer name\r\nthen. It was a long time ago.\r\n\r\n"Anyway, to get back to the story, one day a space liner radios in\r\nthat it wants to make an emergency landing on Calypso for medical\r\nassistance. They had some virulent disease on board and the passengers\r\nand crew were dying like flies.\r\n\r\n"Well, this brother of Joseph, Micheal, or something like that his name\r\nwas, advises Joseph not to give them permission to land. The captain of\r\nthe liner pleads with him, but Joseph tells him to move on, he doesn\'t\r\nwant to take any chances. The ship tried to make the next port, I\r\nforget just what it was, but, anyway, to cut it short, they all died.\r\nThat\'s what started things churning in Joseph\'s bailiwick; a full-scale\r\nrevolution, no less."\r\n\r\n"You missed something there," I said. 

"The people wouldn\'t have been\r\nexpected to be so upset. After all, no matter how mistaken, he must\r\nhave thought he was acting in the interests of everyone on Calypso."\r\n\r\n"Yeah," Sam pointed out, "but the thing is that among the passengers\r\nwas Joseph\'s own boy, the most popular person on the satellite and\r\nthe apple of his old man\'s eye. Nobody had known it, but the kid was\r\nplaying hookey from his school on Terra and was making a cruise of the\r\nJupiter moons.\r\n\r\n"Joseph himself had never been very popular with his people, neither\r\nhad this younger brother of his, Micheal. Too strict, see. 

But\r\neverybody liked the boy and were looking forward to the day when he\'d\r\ntake over the reins of government. When it came out what happened,\r\nthey went berserk. They cornered Joseph and Micheal and a dozen or so\r\nof their close associates in the palace, which was actually more of a\r\nfortress than anything else."\r\n\r\nSam wiped the bar again without need, and said reflectively, "It\r\nmust\'ve been quite a fight. Not that Joseph himself participated. The\r\nboy had been his whole life, and he just moved around like he was in a\r\ntrance.\r\n\r\n"They threw everything at that palace. Every weapon, every device, that\r\nhad been thought up for centuries; but it didn\'t crack. Finally, the\r\nfight was ended by a fleet of battle cruisers from Terra. Joseph and\r\nMicheal and the rest were removed and brought here to Mars. None of\r\nthem dared to remain on Calypso."\r\n\r\nI poured myself another brandy from the bottle that Sam had left on the\r\nbar. "You make quite a story of it," I told him, "but you didn\'t tell\r\nme what you\'d started to--about the immortality."\r\n\r\n"Yeah," he said, "that\'s right. Well, it seems that in the atomic\r\nbombardment of the palace something happened that wound up with Joseph\r\nand his friends all immortal. Don\'t ask me what; I don\'t know and\r\nneither did these scientist guys when they tried to figure it out. Of\r\ncourse, it didn\'t become known for years; not until it became obvious\r\nthey weren\'t dying, or even aging. They continued to appear as they had\r\nat the time of the fight. I don\'t mean they couldn\'t die at all; one by\r\none they dropped away. Two were lost in space; one was blown up in an\r\nexplosion on Terra; another was burned to death; but the only way they\r\ncould die was through accident--or suicide. After a few hundred years\r\nthey were all gone but Joseph, and, of course, he\'d gone batty."\r\n\r\nI interrupted. 

"You mean he\'s insane?"\r\n\r\nThe bartender grinned. "Crazy as a makron."\r\n\r\nI said slowly, "He seemed normal enough to me. Uh ... perhaps a bit\r\neccentric."\r\n\r\nSam said, "Brother, he\'s as far around the corner as you can get. You\r\nknow what he thinks? He thinks that he\'s wandering through space, going\r\nfrom planet to planet, trying to find a situation similar to that in\r\nwhich he sent away the person he loved most to his death. He thinks\r\nthat if he ever finds that similar situation, he\'ll be able to make the\r\nopposite decision from the one he made before and that will redeem him."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI frowned. "Where does he get the money for his wandering around the\r\nplanets?"\r\n\r\n"He don\'t need no money. He\'s good luck. There\'s not a captain in the\r\nsystem that would refuse free passage to old Joseph." Sam shrugged his\r\nbeefy shoulders. 

"And who am I to say otherwise? That\'s why I give the\r\nbums free drinks when he\'s around; so does every other bartender."\r\n\r\nTwo customers had entered and Sam made his way down to them, leaving me\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nA halftripper scurried through the door and cringed up to me. He\r\nwhimpered, "How about a drink, spaceman? I...."\r\n\r\nI flipped him a coin. "Sure, buddy," I said, repressing my usual nausea\r\nat the sight of him. 

I got down from my stool and made my way out. It\r\nwas time for me to return to the spaceport and my job.\r\n\r\nI suppose that I forgot to tell the cabbie to take me to the\r\nadministration building entrance--the first time I\'d made that mistake\r\nin years. I was preoccupied with thoughts of Joseph and the story Sam\r\nhad told of him. The guards at the main gate must have let us through\r\nwithout question when they saw my United Space Lines uniform. At any\r\nrate, when I looked up, it was too late. Not only was I on the landing\r\nfield and in full view of the concrete take-off aprons, but one\r\ngigantic freighter was in the process of blasting off.\r\n\r\nAll the horror of it flowed over me with a rush. The careful training\r\nof years; the work of the doctors who had treated me; all my own\r\nself-discipline--were gone. I shook with terrified frenzy. The depths\r\nof space! The free fall! 

The black emptiness! The utter, uncontrollable\r\nterror!\r\n\r\nI screamed shrilly and the cabbie turned, wide-eyed, to stare at me.\r\n\r\nHe knew the symptoms. "Space cafard! A halftripper!" he gasped, and\r\nspun the cab about to get me to a hospital. He must have realized then\r\nthat my uniform didn\'t necessarily mean that I worked on the liners\r\nthemselves, but that I could be an office employee who only on rare\r\noccasions went near the ships.\r\n\r\nHe knew too, that the very sight of a spacecraft blasting off was\r\nenough to put me in bed for a week; and that I was uncommonly lucky to\r\nhave the funds for the hospitalization. Mars was strewn with the human\r\nwrecks of halftrippers who hadn\'t.\r\n\r\nAs we whirled from the yard, we passed the bent figure of Joseph\r\nwalking unhurriedly toward a liner which was loading for the Venus run.\r\n\r\nMy heart cried out, even through my terror, my sickness:\r\n\r\n_Joseph, Joseph.... So you too are still alive; and still seeking\r\nforgiveness. I had thought I was the last._\r\n\r\n_But you are by far the better off of we two, Joseph. For at least you\r\nhave been free to wander while I have stayed on this one hated spot\r\nsince all those centuries ago when we fled from Calypso and the wrath\r\nof the people who had loved the boy so. As though we hadn\'t loved him\r\nourselves, Joseph._\r\n\r\n_Yes, you are the better off, you can seek throughout the stars for\r\nforgiveness. Then, too, your mind is forever dulled with your madness,\r\nwhile mine is horribly aware, always, of what we\'ve been through and of\r\nthe centuries ahead; it is only blurred when the space cafard comes._\r\n\r\n_Joseph, Joseph ... you didn\'t even recognize your brother Micheal, nor\r\nI you, when we met._\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK HALFTRIPPER ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!)

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\xe2\x80\x99s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
