WESTLAKE\r\n\r\nIllustrated by Douglas\r\n\r\n    _Why should people hate vultures? After all, a vulture never\r\n    kills anyone..._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe launch carrying the mail, supplies and replacements eased slowly\r\nin toward the base, keeping the bulk of the Moon between itself and\r\nEarth. Captain Ebor, seated at the controls, guided the ship to the\r\nrocky uneven ground with the easy carelessness of long practice, then\r\ncut the drive, got to his walking tentacles, and stretched. Donning\r\nhis spacesuit, he left the ship to go over to the dome and meet\r\nDarquelnoy, the base commander.\r\n\r\nAn open ground-car was waiting for him beside the ship. The driver,\r\nencased in his spacesuit, crossed tentacles in a sloppy salute, and\r\nEbor returned the gesture quite as sloppily. Here on the periphery,\r\ncast formalities were all but dispensed with.\r\n\r\nEbor stood for a moment and watched the unloading. The cargo crew,\r\nused to working in spacesuits, had one truck already half full. The\r\nreplacements, unused to spacesuits and, in addition, awed and a bit\r\nstartled by the bleakness of this satellite, were moving awkwardly\r\ndown the ramp.\r\n\r\nSatisfied that the unloading was proceeding smoothly, Ebor climbed\r\naboard the ground-car, awkward in his suit, and settled back heavily\r\nin the seat to try to get used to gravity again. The gravity of this\r\nMoon was slight, of course--barely one-sixth the gravity of the Home\r\nWorld or most of the colonies--but it still took getting used to,\r\nafter a long trip in free-fall.\r\n\r\nThe driver sat at the controls, and the car jerked into motion. Ebor,\r\nlooking up, noticed for the first time that the dome wasn\'t there any\r\nmore. The main dome, housing the staff and equipment of the base, just\r\nwasn\'t there.\r\n\r\nAnd the driver, he now saw, was aiming the car toward the nearby\r\ncrater wall. Extending two of his eyes till they almost touched the\r\nface-plate of his helmet, he could see activity at the base of the\r\ncrater wall, and what looked like an air-lock entrance. He wondered\r\nwhat had caused the change, which had obviously been done at top\r\nspeed. The last time he\'d been here, not very long ago, the dome had\r\nstill been intact, and there had been no hint of any impending move\r\nunderground.\r\n\r\nThe driver steered the car into the open air lock, and they waited\r\nuntil the first cargo truck had lumbered in after them. Then the outer\r\ndoor closed, the pumps were turned on, and in a minute the red light\r\nflashed over the inner door. Ebor removed the spacesuit gratefully,\r\nleft it in the car, and walked clumsily through the inner door into\r\nthe new base.\r\n\r\nA good job had been done on it, for all the speed. Rooms and corridors\r\nhas been melted out of the rock, the floors had been carpeted, the\r\nwalls painted, and the ceiling lined with light panels. All of the\r\nfurnishings had been transferred here from the original dome, and the\r\nresult looked, on the whole, quite livable. As livable as the dome had\r\nbeen, at least.\r\n\r\nBut the base commander, Darquelnoy, waiting for his old friend Ebor\r\nnear the inner door of the lock, looked anything but happy with the\r\narrangement. At Ebor\'s entrance he raised a limp tentacle in weary\r\ngreeting and said, "Come in, my friend, come in. Tell me the new jokes\r\nfrom home. I could use some cheering up."\r\n\r\n"None worth telling," said Ebor. He looked around. "What\'s happened\r\nhere?" he asked. "Why\'ve you gone underground? Why do you need\r\ncheering up?

"\r\n\r\nDarquelnoy clicked his eyes in despair. "Those _things_!" he cried.\r\n"Those annoying little creatures on that blasted planet up there!"\r\n\r\nEbor repressed an amused ripple. He knew Darquelnoy well enough to\r\nknow that the commander invariably overstated things. "What\'ve they\r\nbeen up to, Dar?" 

he asked. "Come on, you can tell me over a hot cup\r\nof restno."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been practically living on the stuff for the last two dren,"\r\nsaid Darquelnoy hopelessly. "Well, I suppose another cup won\'t kill\r\nme. 

Come on to my quarters."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve worked up a fine thirst on the trip," Ebor told him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe two walked down the long corridor together and Ebor said, "Well?\r\nWhat happened?"\r\n\r\n"They came here," Darquelnoy told him simply. At Ebor\'s shocked look,\r\nhe rippled in wan amusement and said, "Oh, it wasn\'t as bad as it\r\nmight have been, I suppose. It was just that we had to rush around so\r\nfrantically, unloading and dismantling the dome, getting this place\r\nready--"\r\n\r\n"What do you mean, they _came_ here?" demanded Ebor.\r\n\r\n"They are absolutely the worst creatures for secrecy in the entire\r\ngalaxy!" exclaimed Darquelnoy in irritation. "Absolutely the worst."\r\n\r\n"Then you\'ve picked up at least one of their habits," Ebor told him.\r\n"Now stop talking in circles and tell me what happened."\r\n\r\n"They built a spaceship, is the long and the short of it," Darquelnoy\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\nEbor stopped in astonishment. "No!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t tell me no!" cried Darquelnoy. "I _saw_ it!" He was obviously\r\nat his wit\'s end.\r\n\r\n"It\'s unbelievable," said Ebor.\r\n\r\n"I know," said Darquelnoy. He led the way into his quarters, motioned\r\nEbor to a perch, and rang for his orderly. "It was just a little\r\nremote-controlled apparatus, of course," he said. 

"The fledgling\r\nattempt, you know. But it circled this Moon here, busily taking\r\npictures, and went right back to the planet again, giving us all a\r\nterrible fright. There hadn\'t been the slightest indication they were\r\nplanning anything _that_ spectacular."\r\n\r\n"None?" asked Ebor. "Not a hint?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, they\'ve been boasting about doing some such thing for ages,"\r\nDarquelnoy told him. "But there was never any indication that they\r\nwere finally serious about it. They have all sorts of military\r\nsecrecy, of course, and so you never know a thing is going to happen\r\nuntil it does."\r\n\r\n"Did they get a picture of the dome?"\r\n\r\n"Thankfully, no. 

And before they had a chance to try again, I whipped\r\neverything underground."\r\n\r\n"It must have been hectic," Ebor said sympathetically.\r\n\r\n"It was," said Darquelnoy simply.\r\n\r\nThe orderly entered. Darquelnoy told him, "Two restno," and he left\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t imagine them making a spaceship," said Ebor thoughtfully. "I\r\nwould have thought they\'d have blown themselves up long before\r\nreaching that stage."\r\n\r\n"I would have thought so, too," said Darquelnoy. "But there it is. At\r\nthe moment, they\'ve divided themselves into two camps--generally\r\nspeaking, that is--and the two sides are trying like mad to outdo each\r\nother in everything. As a part of it, they\'re shooting all sorts of\r\nrubbish into space and crowing every time a piece of the other side\'s\r\nrubbish malfunctions."\r\n\r\n"They could go on that way indefinitely," said Ebor.\r\n\r\n"I know," said Darquelnoy gloomily. "And here we sit."\r\n\r\nEbor nodded, studying his friend. "You don\'t suppose this is all a\r\nwaste of time, do you?" he asked, after a minute.\r\n\r\nDarquelnoy shook a tentacle in negation. "Not at all, not at all.\r\nThey\'ll get around to it, sooner or later. They\'re still boasting\r\nthemselves into the proper frame of mind, that\'s all."\r\n\r\nEbor rippled in sympathetic amusement. "I imagine you sometimes wish\r\nyou could give them a little prodding in the right direction," he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nDarquelnoy fluttered his tentacles in horror, crying, "Don\'t even\r\n_think_ of such a thing!"\r\n\r\n"I know, I know," said Ebor hastily. "The laws--"\r\n\r\n"Never mind the laws," snapped Darquelnoy. "I\'m not even thinking\r\nabout the laws. Frankly, if it would do any good, I might even\r\nconsider breaking one or two of the laws, and the devil with my\r\nconditioning."\r\n\r\n"You _are_ upset," said Ebor at that.\r\n\r\n"But if we were to interfere with those creatures up there," continued\r\nDarquelnoy, "interfere with them in any way at all, it would be\r\nabsolutely disastrous."\r\n\r\nThe orderly returned at that point, with two steaming cups of restno.\r\nDarquelnoy and Ebor accepted the cups and the orderly left, making a\r\nsloppy tentacle-cross salute, which the two ignored.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"I wasn\'t talking necessarily about attacking them, you know," said\r\nEbor, returning to the subject.\r\n\r\n"Neither was I," Darquelnoy told him. "We wouldn\'t have to attack\r\nthem. 

All we would have to do is let them know we\'re here. Not even\r\n_why_ we\'re here, just the simple fact of our presence. That would be\r\nenough. 

_They_ would attack _us_."\r\n\r\nEbor extended his eyes in surprise. "As vicious as all that?"\r\n\r\n"Chilling," Darquelnoy told him. "Absolutely chilling."\r\n\r\n"Then I\'m surprised they haven\'t blown themselves to pieces long\r\nbefore this."\r\n\r\n"Oh, well," said Darquelnoy, "you see, they\'re cowards, too. They have\r\nto boast and brag and shout a while before they finally get to clawing\r\nand biting at one another."\r\n\r\nEbor waved a tentacle. "Don\'t make it so vivid."\r\n\r\n"Sorry," apologized Darquelnoy. He drained his cup of restno. "Out\r\nhere," he said, "living next door to the little beasts day after day,\r\none begins to lose one\'s sensibilities."\r\n\r\n"It has been a long time," agreed Ebor.\r\n\r\n"Longer than we had originally anticipated," Darquelnoy said frankly.\r\n"We\'ve been ready to move in for I don\'t know how long. And instead we\r\njust sit here and wait. 

Which isn\'t good for morale, either."\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t imagine it is."\r\n\r\n"There\'s already a theory among some of the workmen that the blow-up\r\njust isn\'t going to happen, ever. And since that ship went circling\r\nby, of course, morale has hit a new low."\r\n\r\n"It would have been nasty if they\'d spotted you," said Ebor.\r\n\r\n"Nasty?" echoed Darquelnoy. "Catastrophic, you mean. All that crowd up\r\nthere needs is an enemy, and it doesn\'t much matter to them who that\r\nenemy is. If they were to suspect that we were here, they\'d forget\r\ntheir own little squabbles at once and start killing us instead. And\r\nthat, of course, would mean that they\'d be united, for the first time\r\nin their history, and who knows how long it would take them before\r\nthey\'d get back to killing one another again."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Ebor, "you\'re underground now. And it can\'t possibly take\r\nthem _too_ much longer.

"\r\n\r\n"One wouldn\'t think so," agreed Darquelnoy. "In a way," he added,\r\n"that spaceship was a hopeful sign. It means that they\'ll be sending a\r\nmanned ship along pretty soon, and that should do the trick. As soon\r\nas one side has a base on the Moon, the other side is bound to get\r\nthings started.

"\r\n\r\n"A relief for you, eh?" said Ebor.\r\n\r\n"You know," said Darquelnoy thoughtfully, "I can\'t help thinking I was\r\nborn in the wrong age. All this scrabbling around, searching\r\neverywhere for suitable planets. 

Back when the Universe was younger,\r\nthere were lots and lots of planets to colonize. Now the old problem\r\nof half-life is taking its toll, and we can\'t even hope to keep up\r\nwith the birth rate any more. If it weren\'t for the occasional planets\r\nlike that one up there, I don\'t know what we\'d do."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t worry," Ebor told him. "They\'ll have their atomic war pretty\r\nsoon, and leave us a nice high-radiation planet to colonize."\r\n\r\n"I certainly hope it\'s soon," said Darquelnoy. 

"This waiting gets on\r\none\'s nerves." He rang for the orderly.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THEY ALSO SERVE ***\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\xe2\x80\x99s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
