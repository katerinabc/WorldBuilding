]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President of the Chamber of Commerce of Wheedonville by the Sea\r\nwas stately and rather terrifying in his measured wrath. Nor was his\r\nperoration against the dapper young-old man who sat at the foot of the\r\nlong mahogany conference table lessened by the knowledge that he had\r\nthe full support of the rest of that august body.\r\n\r\nBut Wiley Cordes, on whom all this anger was focussed, appeared\r\nsingularly uncowed by the disfavor in which he basked. As a seasoned\r\nresort promotion expert he was not unacquainted with municipal ire. So\r\nmany unforeseen factors could send resort trade swarming to the wrong\r\nresort--as had happened in this case.\r\n\r\nHaving talked himself into the fat job of putting Wheedonville on the\r\nmap as the sea-side town where vacationers would have the amusement\r\nworld at their feet, he had been forced to sit by and watch the bulk of\r\nthe available tourist vacation trade pass to Burden Bay, sixty miles\r\nto the south. It was too bad, of course, but a fellow could only do so\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\n"... and despite your definite assurance--in fact your promise--that\r\nretail trade in Wheedonville by the Sea would pick up a minimum of\r\ntwenty-five per cent, in the year you entered the employment of this\r\nChamber, it has decreased by more than thirty per cent. In this\r\nsame period the retail trade in Burden Bay has risen by almost forty\r\nper cent. I and the Chamber whose spokesman I am would appreciate an\r\nexplanation."\r\n\r\nGathering the skirts of his morning coat carefully to avoid unsightly\r\nwrinkles, the President sat down. The silence which followed his\r\nsonorous harangue could have been scooped up with a spatula. Eight\r\npairs of eyes remained fixed with suspicion upon the object of his\r\naddress.\r\n\r\nWith a sigh, Wiley Cordes got to his feet. Hands in pockets he leaned\r\nagainst the table, jingling the change and keys his fingers found. 

He\r\nwas going to have to make this good or be out of a very soft, high\r\npaying job. Fortunately, he had an idea.\r\n\r\n"When I undertook to lift your resort trade here in Wheedonville by the\r\nSea above that of Burden Bay," he began with an air of good humor that\r\ndrew no response from the grave men listening to him, "I could not, of\r\ncourse, foresee that Mrs. Quinlan in our rival metropolis was going to\r\ngive birth to quintuplets."\r\n\r\nHe paused, let it sink in. "Nor could I look into a crystal ball and\r\nlearn that Wheedonville by the Sea was going to be cursed with five\r\nstraight weeks of fog and rain at the height of the season. And it is\r\nhardly my fault that the Burden Coastal Oil Refineries should bring in\r\nfive gushers."\r\n\r\n"Granted, Cordes," said the President, speaking without arising. "But\r\nwe cannot continue indefinitely against such buffets of fortune--not\r\nand pay twenty-five thousand dollars a year for protection against ill\r\nluck--without receiving an iota of protection."\r\n\r\n"Your sentiments touch me deeply," said Cordes. "And I should not have\r\nbeen worthy of your more than generous salary if I had not studied the\r\nproblem thoroughly and come to this meeting with a plan which should\r\nspeedily put an end to the difficulties under which all of us have been\r\nlaboring."\r\n\r\nCordes paused to let this sink in. He knew, as do all talented pitch\r\nmen, when he had his audience hooked. The expression in the eight pairs\r\nof eyes upon him was still uniform--but it flashed a uniformity of hope.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen," he went on, "the summer season draws rapidly to its close.\r\nIt has not been successful. But Wheedonville by the Sea and Burden Bay\r\nhave both built their reputations as resort cities, much like that of\r\nAtlantic City, upon the warmth of climate and water in fall and spring.\r\nI propose to make Wheedonville by the Sea the only mild-weather resort\r\nin this entire section of coastline."\r\n\r\n"And just how do you propose to do this?" 

asked one of the members,\r\nhis interest aroused above his incredulity. 

In simple words Wiley\r\nCordes told them. At first there were a few protests upon humanitarian\r\ngrounds. But they were not enduring. After all the Chamber of Commerce\r\nwas a collection of hard-headed businessmen. Furthermore they were\r\nhard-pressed businessmen. 

Their ultimate approval was unanimous, as was\r\ntheir vow to mutual secrecy. There was little else they could do.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCold weather was a factor in Cordes\' scheme. But cold weather descends\r\nin occasional unseasonable snaps upon the balmiest of resort climate.\r\nEven in Florida and Texas there has been snow during recent years. For\r\nonce the luck ran for Cordes and his quasi-desperate employers.\r\n\r\nEarly upon a morning in late September, less than a week after the\r\nshowdown meeting, a plane took off, not from the Wheedonville Municipal\r\nAirport but from a private field that lurked less prosperously and\r\npublicly in the resort city\'s villa-studded suburbs.\r\n\r\nThe plane, a converted Mitchell B-25 AAF bomber, was piloted by\r\nWiley Cordes himself--aviation was among his numerous personal\r\naccomplishments. There were bombs in the bomb bay--but bombs of a type\r\nnot yet seen in war. 

Millions of pellets of dry ice were so stowed away\r\nthat they could be sowed high in the atmosphere by continued pressure\r\nupon a release trigger in the cockpit.\r\n\r\nThe cloud formations were just right--with heavy layers above the\r\ntarget area and little wind. The temperature, in the high thirties\r\nat ground level, was below zero two miles up. After getting a sight\r\nthrough the cloud strata, Wiley Cordes began to sow his snow.\r\n\r\nBack and forth he flew for the better part of an hour, bombarding the\r\nclouds with ice pellets to make snow. He had timed his flight with care\r\nso that no other plane would be aloft when he reached the sky above the\r\nrival Burden Bay resort--no others took off once the snow storm began.\r\nIncoming planes were routed to Wheedonville by the Sea.\r\n\r\nWiley Cordes listened to the reports on his radio as he flew back to\r\nthe secluded airport outside of Wheedonville. From the tenor of the\r\nannouncers it was clearly evident that no one suspected the snowstorm\r\nhad been deliberately induced by the hand of man. After taxiing his\r\nex-bomber into the hangar, he got out of flying togs and drove to the\r\nWheedonville City Club, where the members of the Chamber of Commerce\r\nwere waiting.\r\n\r\nIf the mood of their previous meeting had been glum, today joy was\r\nunconfined. Old whiskey was brought out, and a special banquet served\r\nby close-mouthed club attendants. The radio was left on, and each\r\nreport of the inexplicable snowstorm which had brought a halt to the\r\nBurden Bay autumn season was the occasion for a toast.\r\n\r\n"The man who really deserves our thanks," said the President, lifting\r\nhis glass to Wiley Cordes. A chorus of "Hear, hear" greeted his salute.\r\nWiley, entering into the spirit of the occasion, waxed enthusiastic\r\nwhen he was given the floor after cigars were passed.\r\n\r\n"It is my belief," he went on, "that by repeatedly inducing snow\r\nto fall over our neighbor city I can ultimately reduce its mean\r\ntemperature by the very emanation of cold from the snow covered ground\r\nto a point where it will remain colder than normal throughout the fall,\r\nwinter and spring.\r\n\r\n"Furthermore," he added, his well-preserved face alight with optimism,\r\n"I see no reason why we should limit ourselves to snowstorms. The same\r\ndry ice treatment, given to the right cloud formation above Burden Bay\r\nwhen opportunity offers, should produce a certain percentage of rainy\r\nweekends and holidays. I can truthfully say that our worries are over."\r\n\r\n"Keep it up, and you\'ll find a welcome surprise in your pay envelope,\r\nWiley," said the President, beaming. The arrival of the afternoon\r\npapers from Burden Bay was the signal to cease all speech making for a\r\ngood gloat.\r\n\r\nThe journalists of Wheedonville by the Sea\'s ancient rival, beneath\r\na commendable effort to gloss over the disaster, were really crying\r\ncatastrophe. Coming without warning, the baby blizzard--for it had\r\namounted almost to that--had literally caught them with their plants\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nDamage, it was hinted in stories hastily killed for later editions,\r\nwould almost certainly run high into millions. Hotel reservations for\r\nthe usually equable autumn months were already being canceled. As if to\r\nprove it never snowed but it poured, the Oil Refinery chose that day\r\nto announce the failure of a sixth gusher and resultant passing of a\r\ndividend.\r\n\r\nThree days later, when clouds again moved in on the coastline, Wiley\r\nCordes took to the air with another load of dry ice pellets. And once\r\nagain he did his dirty work undetected and with disastrous results for\r\nBurden Bay.\r\n\r\nOn his third trip, because of a low current of warm air of whose\r\nexistence he was not informed, Wiley came in with a rain storm that\r\nwashed away most of the snow. But his fourth, fifth and sixth one-plane\r\nraids more than made up for this lapse.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWiley Cordes and Wheedonville by the Sea were riding high. Hotels were\r\npacked and concessions were booming. The public relations expert found\r\nhis salary raised an added hundred dollars a week. There was laughter\r\nat a Chamber meeting over a Burden Bay picture release showing a couple\r\nof pretty girls in ski clothes backed by a slide made of the defunct\r\noil gushers.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll get the chorus of Mike Todd\'s new musical down here next weekend\r\nand put them on water skis in bathing suits," promised the laughing\r\nWiley Cordes. Of course he knew it could not last forever. 

But he saw\r\nno reason for the run of good fortune to come to an early end. He had\r\nplanned and executed his scheme too well.\r\n\r\nSo he was not pleased to discover another plane above the clouds on his\r\nnext trip over Burden Bay. Still, it was something that had to happen.\r\nHe merely cruised on innocently and was relieved when the other ship--a\r\nbig four-motored flying boxcar--disappeared through the clouds. Then he\r\nswung back and did his stuff.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: There was another plane above the clouds over Burden\r\nBay.]\r\n\r\nHe saw the plane on three more occasions as he placed snowstorms\r\naccurately over hapless Burden Bay and its presence began to worry him.\r\nBut the pilot gave no indication that he knew what Wiley was up to and\r\nthe discreet young public relations counsellor decided not to mention\r\nit to the men who were backing his scheme.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this step and of his own pre-occupation with promoting\r\nthe balmy atmosphere of Wheedonville by the Sea, he was really caught\r\noff-guard when disaster finally struck. As fall merged into winter the\r\nreservations totals for Wheedonville hotels fell off far more sharply\r\nthan it should have--especially with Burden Bay out of the picture.\r\n\r\nIt was the President of the Chamber of Commerce who broke the news to\r\nWiley Cordes, after summoning him to his office in early December.\r\nThere he simply tossed a telegram at his high powered promoter. No\r\nwords were needed to explain his mood--it was evident enough from the\r\njut of his beetling gray brows and the bayonet-angle of his Corona\r\nCorona.\r\n\r\n"Read this," he said laconically. "Read it and pack."\r\n\r\nStartled, Wiley complied, felt himself go gray and sick and shaky as he\r\nscanned the contents of the wire.\r\n\r\nIt read:\r\n\r\n    TO CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WHEEDONVILLE BY THE SEA THANK YOU STOP\r\n    ESPECIAL THANKS TO WILEY CORDES FOR TRIPLING OUR OFF-SEASON RESORT\r\n    TRADE STOP HIS SNOWMAKING FLIGHTS NO LONGER NEEDED STOP WE HAVE\r\n    ADOPTED IDEA OURSELVES STOP ONCE AGAIN THANKS FROM THE ONLY SKI\r\n    RESORT ON THE COAST STOP COME AND TRY OUR NEW RUNS AT OUR EXPENSE\r\n    AS SMALL RETURN FOR YOUR FAVOR STOP BURDEN BAY CHAMBER OF COMMERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CLIMATE\xe2\x80\x94DISORDERED ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!)

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\xe2\x80\x99s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
