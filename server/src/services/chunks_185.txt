]\r\n\r\n\r\nYou know Rosemary Brooks. You have known her for many years.\r\n\r\nIt is said that when she was a little girl her favorite poem was\r\n_Barbara Frietchie_, and it is told how she would sometimes poke her\r\npretty head out of her bedroom window, survey the suburban street with\r\nher blue-sky eyes, and cry, "_Shoot, if you must, this old gray head,\r\nbut spare your country\'s flag!_"\r\n\r\nYes, you know Rosemary. You know her very well.\r\n\r\nLike all little girls, Rosemary grew up. But Rosemary did not change.\r\nThis is not to say that she did not turn into an attractive young lady.\r\nShe turned into a most attractive one indeed. Fragilely beautiful, airy\r\nof tread, she should have been the reigning rose of every dance she\r\nwent to, but she was not. Rarely did the young men of her acquaintance\r\nask her to dance, and never did one of them approach her and say,\r\n"Come into the garden, Rosemary, for the black bat, night, has flown."\r\nShe did not go to very many dances in any event, and looking back, one\r\nrealizes that the few she did attend, she attended primarily to please\r\nher mother. The reason behind Rosemary\'s wallflowerhood is simple: the\r\nyoung men of her acquaintance knew that with her, God and the United\r\nStates of America came first, and that accompanying her through life,\r\nor even accompanying her home from a dance for that matter, meant being\r\nrelegated to a back seat. It is alright for little girls to be Barbara\r\nFrietchies, you see, but not for big ones.\r\n\r\nDuring her short and dedicated life, Rosemary poked her pretty head\r\nout of quite a number of windows. After the Barbara Frietchie window\r\ncame the Girl Scouts of America window, and after the Girl Scouts of\r\nAmerica window came the Young Peoples\' Civil War Society window, and\r\nafter the Young Peoples\' Civil War Society window came the Citizens for\r\nPatriotic Progress window. Last of all came the Astronette Training\r\nCenter window.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSet up by Project Rain Dance in 1969 after prejudice against women\r\ngoing into space had abated, the Astronette Training Center had for\r\nits purpose the finding, training, and conditioning of six female\r\npilots for a series of six manned weather-control satellite shots, the\r\nfirst of which was scheduled to take place some time in February of\r\n\'71. After exhaustive screening, one hundred volunteers were accepted.\r\nFifteen of them passed the exacting physical and psychological tests,\r\nand from the ranks of the fifteen, the six astronettes were chosen.\r\nIncredibly, when one considers her delicateness (and fails to consider\r\nher patriotic fervor), Rosemary not only made the grade but was\r\nselected to accompany the first weather-control satellite to be placed\r\nin orbit.\r\n\r\nAll of this is history now--faded words on newsprint, old photographs,\r\na dozen dusty articles in as many magazines--but at the time, it\r\ncaptured the attention of the whole wide world. It is said that\r\nMadison Avenue nearly went out of its mind trying to circumvent the\r\nregulation that prohibited astronettes from underwriting testimonials\r\nto toothpaste, cosmetics, and cigarettes. This is not to be wondered\r\nat. If Rosemary could have been legally enticed, for example, into\r\nletting her picture appear in a cigarette ad, cigarette consumption\r\nprobably would have doubled overnight. It is one thing to be an\r\nobscure Barbara Frietchie and quite another to be a famous one, and\r\nthe patriotic devotion shining in a person\'s eyes can, through the\r\nthaumaturgy of photography and touch-up, be transmuted into a sensual\r\ngleam.\r\n\r\nFebruary of \'71 arrived at last, as all months must, and a specific\r\ndate was set for the launching. Psychological winter had come and gone,\r\nbut no singing of birds could be heard. 

Even as far south as Canaveral,\r\ngray skies were the rule, and gray rain fell intermittently. 

Countdown\r\nwas begun regardless. And then, miraculously it seemed, the skies\r\ncleared, and the day of the launching dawned bright and clear. There\r\nis a photograph of Rosemary standing in her snow-white spacesuit at\r\nthe base of the gantry, her space helmet resting in the crook of her\r\narm. The photograph is in color, and the blueness of her eyes is not\r\none whit different in shade and texture from the blueness of the sky\r\nbehind her. 

This is as it should be. Looking at her hair, one thinks\r\nof sunrises and sunsets. This is as it should be too. When remembering\r\nRosemary, it is fitting that one should think of the sun and the sky.\r\nIt is equally fitting that one should think of the snow and the rain.\r\nFor Rosemary is nothing if she is not all of these things.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe launching was a good one. The _Rainbow 6_ rode its Saturn booster\r\nlike a bird on jet-fire wings, and the bright star of its passage\r\nseemed to linger in the morning sky long after the booster had\r\nfallen away. The television cameras caught the action beautifully,\r\nand the American public, reminded once again that the noblest thing\r\na person can do is to risk his life for his country, looked on in\r\nawe and admiration. The orbit was a good one too: apogee--203 miles;\r\nperigee--191 miles. Rosemary radioed back that she was A-okay.\r\n\r\nShe was supposed to complete three orbits, then climb into the escape\r\ncapsule, jettison it and herself, re-enter the atmosphere, and\r\nparachute into the Atlantic. There, a task force waited eagerly to pick\r\nher up. Her mission was to orientate the satellite\'s weather-factor\r\ninstruments to the existent cloud patterns and jet streams. Once this\r\nwas accomplished, the telemetric readings would, through the medium of\r\nthe Main Weather Control Station in Oregon, dictate future weather.\r\nWeather control had been in effect since the middle sixties, but the\r\ntelemetric readings of the unmanned weather-control satellites, owing\r\nto faulty orientation, had fallen far short of the one-hundred percent\r\naccuracy needed to make the regulation of rain and sunshine something\r\nmore than a half-realized dream, and it was hoped that the present\r\nsatellite, given a human boost, would bring the dream to fruition.\r\n\r\nOne can picture Rosemary high in the sky, faithfully carrying out her\r\nassignment. One can see her sitting there before the instrument panel\r\nof the _Rainbow 6_ looking at dawns and sunsets and stars. 

One can\r\nsee the slow drift of cloud and continent beneath her. Australia now,\r\nand now the vast blueness of the Pacific ... and now the west coast\r\nrising out of mists of distances and air, and beyond it, the vast green\r\nblur of the land that gave her birth. Little Barbara Frietchie riding\r\non a star.... Far beneath her now, highways wind; rivers run down to\r\nseas. Patternings of field and forest blend into pale blue-greens.\r\nFresh-water lakes look up at her with blue and wondering eyes. Now the\r\nsea of night drifts forth to meet her. 

Bravely she sets sail upon the\r\ndark waves in her little silvery ship. Brief night, soft sunrise, new\r\nday.\r\n\r\n    _I bring fresh showers for the thirsting flowers,\r\n    From the seas and the streams;\r\n    I bear light shade for the leaves when laid\r\n    In their noonday dreams._\r\n\r\nLittle Barbara Frietchie riding on a star....\r\n\r\nJettisoning took place exactly on schedule. The weather-control\r\nsatellite continued on its orbital way, and Rosemary plummeted\r\nearthward in the escape capsule. That much, at least, is known. But\r\nwhat took place during re-entry--whether the retro rockets failed to\r\nfire, whether the attitude controls malfunctioned, or whether the heat\r\nshield proved to be defective--is not known and never will be known.\r\nAll that is known is that Rosemary became a falling star.\r\n\r\nThe nation mourned. The whole wide world mourned. Project Rain Dance\r\nwas discontinued. It would have been discontinued in any event, for\r\nRosemary had obviated any further need for it. She had done her job\r\nwell, Rosemary had, and in the doing of it, she had placed the weather\r\nin the palm of mankind\'s out-stretched hand.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat spring, the rains were soft and warm and the flowers grew\r\nriotously upon the face of the earth. Grass knew a greenness it had\r\nnever known before, and trees dressed each day in lovelier and lovelier\r\ndresses. The rains fell in the cities and on the plains. In valleys and\r\nin little towns. 

On fields and forests and lawns. And when the land had\r\ndrunk its fill, the sun came out as warm and as bright as Rosemary\'s\r\nhair, and the sky turned as blue as her eyes.\r\n\r\nYes, you know Rosemary, and you are in love with her in a way. If you\r\nare not, you should be. She is the sun coming up in the morning and\r\nthe sun going down at night. She is the gentle rain against your face\r\nin spring. She is the snow falling on Christmas Eve. She is every\r\nglorious rainbow you see in the rain-washed sky. She is that pattern\r\nof tree-shade over there. Each morning, when you are lying fast asleep\r\nin your trundle bed, she tiptoes into your room, her golden sandals\r\nsoundless on the bedroom floor, and wakes you with a golden kiss.\r\nSunlight is her laughter, her voice the patter of the rain--Soft you\r\nnow!--she speaks:\r\n\r\n    _I am the daughter of the earth and water,\r\n    And the nursling of the sky;\r\n    I pass through the pores of the ocean and shores;\r\n    I change, but I cannot die...._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK I BRING FRESH FLOWERS ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!)

It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
