]\r\n\r\n\r\n"In the middle of the night," the man said to the landlady over a\r\nsoft-boiled egg and a slice of toast. "Right under my window." 

He\r\nleaned forward. "You know how children talk to themselves?"\r\n\r\n"Was it the same voice you heard the first two nights?" Mrs. Tilton\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not sure now about the first night. Might have been another voice\r\nthat first night."\r\n\r\n"And now it was a child?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nMrs. Tilton rose to get the coffee. "Are you quite sure?

"\r\n\r\n"You don\'t think I\'m imagining?"\r\n\r\n"We have no children," she said.\r\n\r\n"A neighbor\'s, no doubt."\r\n\r\n"There isn\'t a child in the whole village, Mr. Coat.

"\r\n\r\n"That\'s what puzzles me. 

Don\'t you think we ought to report it?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll get your coffee," she said, and went into the kitchen.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t actually _see_ the child," he called to her. "But I\'m sure I\r\nheard the voice."\r\n\r\nThe woman brought the cup of coffee; she had poured it in the kitchen.\r\nThe first two mornings, he remembered, she had set the coffee pot on\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t you having any?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I had mine, thank you. Will you want anything else?"\r\n\r\nHe could see past her into the kitchen--the corner of a large\r\nwood-burning stove and a row of brass pots. The floor was flagstoned\r\nand a hand pump stood over a sink.\r\n\r\n"Do you really grow your own strawberries?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes. 

Would you like some?"\r\n\r\n"Very much."\r\n\r\nMrs. Tilton went to get the berries. She had forgotten to serve cream\r\nwith the coffee. The coffee had a bitter taste and a faint smell of\r\niodine. But he was not used to natural coffee. And without cream. He\r\ntook another sip and slowly stretched his stiff legs. In the window he\r\nsaw lilac bushes in bloom.\r\n\r\n"Picked this morning," Mrs. Tilton said, setting a bowl of strawberries\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\n"Oh, thank you." He sniffed at the berries. "They smell of earth," he\r\nsaid, smiling at her.\r\n\r\n"You might like a walk after breakfast," Mrs. Tilton suggested. "Then\r\nyou can have a restful nap at noon."\r\n\r\n"Good idea," he said. "Excuse me, but the coffee seems bitter."\r\n\r\nMrs. Tilton looked at the old man as if she did not understand.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid I\'m a nuisance," he apologized, "but I take cream with my\r\ncoffee."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry, I forgot."\r\n\r\nShe brought a small cream pitcher.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe old man turned the pitcher in his hand. It was lopsided and made of\r\ninferior clay "Do you make your own pottery, too?"\r\n\r\n"Such as it is."\r\n\r\n"Charming." He set down the pitcher and leaned back with a sigh. "You\r\nknow, I pretended I did not want a rest, but I could hardly wait to see\r\nthe country again."\r\n\r\n"You weren\'t born in the city?"\r\n\r\n"I was born in a village no larger than this. Of course it\'s all gone\r\nnow, swallowed up by the city. But in those days it was an hour\'s\r\nheliride from the city. I remember a thing or two."\r\n\r\nMrs. Tilton watched him drink the coffee.\r\n\r\n"Not many people left who remember those days," he said. "For\r\ninstance, did you know that unadjustables--they called them criminals\r\nthen--were actually electrocuted? Strapped down to a horrible chair--"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you want the strawberries, Mr. Coat?"\r\n\r\nHe looked down at the strawberries in the bowl. "Just imagine--" but he\r\nforgot what he had wanted to say.\r\n\r\nThe woman went into the kitchen.\r\n\r\nHe had just finished drinking the coffee when he heard the child\'s\r\nvoice in the lane outside the window. The same voice. 

He crossed to the\r\nwindow and looked out. The lane was empty.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Tilton!"\r\n\r\nHe heard no answer.\r\n\r\nHe went into the kitchen. The door to the garden stood open. He saw her\r\nworking in a vegetable patch.\r\n\r\n"Pst ... pst!"\r\n\r\nShe looked up.\r\n\r\n"Did you see the child?" he called. "It must have turned into the\r\ngarden."\r\n\r\nMrs. Tilton straightened herself, holding her back with both hands.\r\n"The child?"\r\n\r\n"The voice, I just heard it again."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be with you in a moment, Mr. Coat."\r\n\r\nHe looked round the kitchen--the antique flagstones, the brass pots,\r\nthe stove, the hand pump. There was only one anachronism: on the wall\r\nby the door, stuck behind a cluster of radishes, was a World Union\r\nTelegram.\r\n\r\nOut in the vegetable patch, he saw Mrs. Tilton was looking about for\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\nOn an impulse he took down the telegram, and read:\r\n\r\n    RECOAT IF VOICES PERSIST TO THIRD MORNING PROCEED EUTHANASIA\r\n    SUGGEST USING COFFEE FORMULA TWO ADVISE OFFICE OF CHIEF PSYCH WMA\r\n\r\nHe stuck the telegram behind the radishes and looked out the door. Mrs.\r\nTilton was coming with a basket on her arm.\r\n\r\n"You heard the child again, Mr. Coat?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps ... I was mistaken."\r\n\r\n"Strange, I saw nobody." She put the basket on the kitchen table; it\r\nwas filled with peas. "Did you have enough coffee?"\r\n\r\nHe nodded.\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t you feeling well?"\r\n\r\n"I ... am fine. Yes."\r\n\r\nThe executioner looked as if she could not make up her mind about him.\r\nThen she smiled. She brought out a wooden bowl, and sat down at the\r\ntable to shell the peas.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you take your walk now? You\'ll enjoy our little market\r\nplace."\r\n\r\n"Yes." Such a nice day, he thought, shuffling to the window. Spring.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe had enjoyed the market yesterday until he had noticed that there\r\nwere no children about. No children at all. 

Only adult primitives and a\r\nfew well-trained functionaries like Mrs. Tilton.\r\n\r\nIn the sky in the window he saw a rocket cutting a thin line as it left\r\nthe atmosphere.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll have your bed ready for your noon nap," she said.\r\n\r\nHe turned from the window. "Noon?"\r\n\r\n"You\'ll want a nice restful nap then."\r\n\r\nHe had imagined the poisoned coffee would work faster. His heart\r\nbeating, he said, "Those are peas, aren\'t they?"\r\n\r\nShe nodded. 

Her hands were busy shelling. "I hung your cane on the coat\r\nrack," she said.\r\n\r\n"If you don\'t mind, Mrs. Tilton, I\'d rather not go out today. I\'d very\r\nmuch like to try shelling peas for you."\r\n\r\n"Why, of course. 

Pull up that chair, why don\'t you?"\r\n\r\nSitting down, he reached his trembling hands into the basket and came\r\nup with a handful of the green wonders. Mrs. Tilton moved the basket\r\nnearer him.\r\n\r\n"After a while I\'ll go up to my room," he promised. "I feel a little\r\ntired already."\r\n\r\n"Certainly."\r\n\r\nHe split a shell and slid his thumb under the peas. They rolled into\r\nhis hand. He counted nine. He dropped them in the bowl, then put one in\r\nhis mouth and chewed. It had a sweet taste.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Mrs. Tilton."\r\n\r\n"Not at all, Mr. 

Coat."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THIS WAY TO THE EGRESS ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
