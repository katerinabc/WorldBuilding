HATFIELD\r\n\r\n              It was the Doorway to Earth\'s Destruction.\r\n                  And Kelvin Martin, the only man who\r\n                   could lock it--had lost the key.\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n                      Planet Stories Winter 1942.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.

]\r\n\r\n\r\nOld Kelvin Martin strained futilely against the rope that held\r\nimmovable his thin wrists. A crimsoned bruise raced across his forehead\r\nwhere Vance had slugged him with a heavy hand.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be a complete fool, Vance!" he said harshly. 

"That machine can\'t\r\nbring you anything but trouble!"\r\n\r\nThe scientist\'s burly assistant glanced wearily up from where he\r\ncoupled heavy batteries in series at the rear of the glittering machine\r\nthat entirely filled one corner of the windowless room.\r\n\r\n"Shut up," he said tonelessly.\r\n\r\nKelvin Martin sagged back in sheer futility, felt a deadly numbness\r\ncreeping through his extremities from the tightness of his bonds. He\r\nwatched the other out of eyes faintly fearful and desperate.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll make a deal, Vance," he said finally. "I\'ve got about eight\r\nthousand dollars in the bank; free me, don\'t try to use that machine,\r\nand the money is yours!"\r\n\r\nJon Vance\'s laughter was brittle and scornful.\r\n\r\n"Eight thousand!" he sneered. 

"Hell, I\'ve seen those snapshots you\r\nbrought back! Any one of those gems the \'other people\' wore would bring\r\nthat. And I intend to bring back all I can carry!"\r\n\r\nKelvin Martin shivered, remembering the restless cruelty that had lain\r\nin the creatures he had found with his machine. There was still a dull\r\nache along his ribs where a needle-like ray of terrific energy had\r\nseared.\r\n\r\n"They aren\'t human, Vance." He tried to speak quietly, endeavored\r\nto drive his point with impersonal logic. 

"They are of a fierceness\r\nand cruelty such as you couldn\'t comprehend. And with their superior\r\nweapons, they\'d subjugate the entire world in a matter of days."\r\n\r\n"Hooey!" Jon Vance spat insolently, patted the .45 automatic at his\r\nhip. "I think I might do a bit of subjugating myself."\r\n\r\nHe tested the batteries.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know how it works, Martin," he said briefly. 

"But I don\'t\r\ncare, just as long as it makes me rich."\r\n\r\nOf course, Jon Vance did not fully understand the machine; even he,\r\nhimself, had trouble at times in comprehending the space-warping\r\npropensities of the machine he had built over a period of three years.\r\n\r\nHe knew only that the machine warped itself and its occupant into\r\nanother universe--a galactic maelstrom of whirling suns and gigantic\r\nplanets--onto a world where he had met a race of living beings that\r\nseemed to be super-endowed with unhuman hate and cruelty.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe felt the sickness of futility within him when he remembered the one\r\ntime he had invaded that other space. He had stepped from the machine\r\nand been greeted, cautiously but cordially, by those great-headed\r\nsuper-beings. For days he had been entertained and shown the weird\r\nsights of that alien planet. And it wasn\'t until he woke one night, to\r\nsee the curious machine hanging motionless over him, its pale blue aura\r\ncovering his sleeping couch, that he realized that he was being drained\r\nof his knowledge subtly every night.\r\n\r\nHe had raced from his sleeping room, fought with the single gun he had\r\ntaken with him, blasted his way through the screaming mob that tried\r\nto hold him captive. He had fought down the long stairs, through the\r\npalace door, and had fled into the night, pursued by the men who had\r\nprotested their friendship.\r\n\r\nWith his last bullet, he had killed the High-Priest, stepped over the\r\nprone body, and lurched into his machine. His fingers had flicked the\r\nlevers on the control panel; there was the instant hum of purring\r\npower--and then the machine had whisked him back to his own planet.\r\n\r\nHe had sat for hours in the machine, too drained of energy to move,\r\nknowing that only a miracle had saved his machine\'s secret from the\r\naliens that had planned to use it for an invasion of another space.\r\n\r\nBut now, because of the stupid greed of Jon Vance, because the man did\r\nnot realize the slavery and terror the aliens would bring to Earth, the\r\nmachine was gone--and he was a prisoner in the laboratory room.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe made one final desperate plea.\r\n\r\n"All right, Vance, if that\'s the way it is," he said tiredly. "But if\r\nanything goes wrong, destroy that machine; those monsters will use it\r\nto invade our system."\r\n\r\nJon Vance whistled thoughtfully, watching the scientist out of shiny\r\neyes, his heavy features drawn into a frown. Then he shrugged.\r\n\r\n"If things don\'t go as planned, maybe I can make a deal," he said.\r\n"After all, I always did think I\'d like to be a big shot.

"\r\n\r\n"You couldn\'t!" Sheer horror froze Martin into motionlessness.\r\n\r\n"The hell I couldn\'t!" Jon Vance stooped, edged through gleaming wires,\r\nseated himself at the machine\'s controls.\r\n\r\nHe twisted a rheostat, closed a switch, grinned at the supine\r\nscientist. Kelvin Martin said nothing more, but there was a grim\r\ndetermination replacing the panic in his faded eyes.\r\n\r\nA vacuum tube swelled with coruscating colors, and a nimbus of light\r\ngrew from a lacing of wires around the edges of the machine. There was\r\na dull throbbing in the close air, a rushing sense of the releasing of\r\nterrible, unknown power. A misty curtain seemed to be drawing tight\r\nabout the machine\'s outline.\r\n\r\nThen the machine was gone from its platform, and Kelvin Martin was\r\nalone in the great, bare experimental room.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKelvin Martin didn\'t move for seconds, then he struggled into a sitting\r\nposition. He fought the ropes with a silent doggedness that sent the\r\nhot blood pounding turgidly at his temples. His mouth gaped, as he\r\nstrained and twisted futilely, and the panic in his eyes was a terrible\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nThen he sagged limply, realizing that the ropes were too well-knotted\r\nfor him to release himself unaided.\r\n\r\n"God!" he prayed.\r\n\r\nHe drew his legs beneath him, shoved himself back until his shoulders\r\ntouched a side wall. Sitting there, he searched the room with feverish\r\neyes for any object with a cutting edge. 

His heart sank, when he saw\r\nthe bare sterility of the room. Without windows, without tools or\r\nfurniture, there was not a thing in the room that could be broken or\r\nused to sever the cutting ropes at his wrists.\r\n\r\nKelvin Martin sobbed deep in his throat, glanced at the door,\r\nremembering how Vance had locked it and pocketed the key.\r\n\r\nHe remembered the cigar lighter in his pocket, tried to fumble it out,\r\nwith the intention of burning his bonds. Dull horror pounded at his\r\nmind when he realized that his hands were completely numb, without the\r\npower of following the dictates of his mind.\r\n\r\nHe had no way of visualizing how long the treacherous Vance would be\r\ngone, no way of knowing whether the man would return victorious. But\r\nclear reasoning told him that the monstrous people of the other world\r\nwould slay Vance, then use Martin\'s machine as the doorway through\r\nwhich to pass their conquering hordes. Too, the machine would serve as\r\nthe model for more carriers.\r\n\r\nHe straightened at the thought, memory struggling for expression in his\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nHe followed the lines of the walls, leaning against them for support,\r\nedging forward with agonizing slowness by jumping his tied feet.\r\nPerspiration dotted his white face, and his thinning hair lay tight on\r\nhis small head, but slowly the smile broadened on his lips.\r\n\r\nAt last, he rested against the wall, then gently slid to a seated\r\nposition. He tested his bonds again, ceased the futile struggle almost\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nHe sat for a time, then lay back and stared at the ceiling. He thought\r\nof many things in those passing moments, thoughts of his dreams of\r\ngiving scientific miracles to the world, of having his bust in the Hall\r\nof Fame, of people he had known, and things he had done.\r\n\r\nRegret shadowed his memories, when he remembered things that he had\r\nleft undone and unforgiven. Then he shrugged a bit, lay breathing\r\nquietly, waiting for the machine to return.\r\n\r\nHe felt the sensation of released forces a few seconds before the\r\nmachine reappeared. He sat, drew his legs to his chest, scooted back\r\na few feet. He waited, content, wondering just what would happen. He\r\nwas smiling when the machine and its unhuman occupants whisked out of\r\nnothing into shadowy being. One glance they had of the smile on his\r\ntired face--then the very air seemed to explode with gigantic twistings\r\nand loopings of unleashed forces.\r\n\r\nFor Scientist Kelvin Martin had remembered one scientific fact from his\r\ncollege days. He had recalled that two material objects may not occupy\r\nthe same period of space.\r\n\r\nAnd sitting, bound, on the machine\'s platform, he had awaited the\r\ncoming of the Frankensteinian monster he had created.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s Doorway to Destruction, by Garold S.

It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
