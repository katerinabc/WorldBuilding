"Captain Maxon and Vaughn have called\r\nin. 

There\'s been no word from Ragan."\r\n\r\nCoordinator Erwin took his seat beside the psychologist, his bearing\r\nas militarily authoritative in spite of civilian clothing as the room\'s\r\nair was medical.\r\n\r\n"Maybe Ragan won\'t turn up," Erwin said. "Maybe we\'ve still got a man\r\nout there to bring the ship back."\r\n\r\nCostain made a quieting gesture, his eyes on the three-man psych\r\nteam grouped about Walraven\'s wheeled reclining chair. "They\'ve given\r\nWalraven a light somnolent. Not enough to put him out, just enough to\r\nmake him relive the flight in detail. Accurately."\r\n\r\nThe lead psych man killed the room\'s lighting to a glow. "Lieutenant\r\nWalraven, the ship is ready. You are at your post, with Captain Maxon\r\nand Lieutenants Vaughn and Ragan. The first Mars flight is about to\r\nblast off. How do you feel?"\r\n\r\nWalraven lay utterly relaxed, his face dreaming. His voice had the\r\nwaning sound of a tape running down for lack of power.\r\n\r\n"Jumpy," he said. "But not really afraid. We\'re too well conditioned\r\nfor that, I guess. This is a big thing, an important thing. 

Exciting."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt had been exciting at first. The long preparation over, training and\r\nstudy and news interviews and final parties all dreamlike and part of\r\nthe past. Outside now, invisible but hearteningly present beyond the\r\nship\'s impermeable hull, the essential and privileged people waiting to\r\nsee them off. The ship\'s power plant was humming gently like a giant,\r\npatient cat.\r\n\r\nCaptain Maxon passed out muscle-relaxant capsules. The total boneless\r\nrelaxation that was their defense against acceleration came quickly.\r\n\r\nThe ship was two hours out, beyond lunar orbit and still accelerating,\r\nwhen, trained for months against the moment, set each about his task.\r\nReadings occupied Maxon and Vaughn and Ragan while Walraven checked his\r\ncommunications and telemetering gear.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the transmitter slot had licked up its first coded\r\ntape--no plain text here, security before even safety--and reported all\r\nwell, the predicted borne out, that they became aware of the Feeling.\r\n\r\nThe four of them sat in their unsqueaking gimbaled seats and looked\r\nat each other, sharing the Feeling and knowing that they shared it,\r\nbut not why. Vaughn, who was given to poetry and some degree of\r\nsoul-searching, made the first open recognition.\r\n\r\n"There\'s something wrong," he said.\r\n\r\nThe others agreed and, agreeing, could add nothing of explanation to\r\nthe wrongness. Time passed while they sat, seeing within themselves for\r\nthe answer--and if not for answer, at least for identification--but\r\nnothing came and nothing changed except that with time the steady\r\npressure of the Feeling grew stronger.\r\n\r\nVaughn, again, was first to react to the pressure. "We\'ve got to\r\ndo something." He twisted out of his seat and wavered in the small\r\npseudogravity of the ship\'s continuing acceleration. "I\'ve never in my\r\nlife felt so desolate, so--"\r\n\r\nHe stopped. "There aren\'t any words," he said helplessly.\r\n\r\nLess articulate than Vaughn and knowing it, the others did not try to\r\nhelp find the words. Only Ragan, professional soldier without family or\r\nclose tie anywhere in the world, had a suggestion.\r\n\r\n"The ship\'s power plant is partly psionic," Ragan said. "I don\'t\r\nunderstand the principle, but it\'s been drilled into us that no\r\nother system can give a one-directional thrust without reaction. The\r\npsi-drive is tied into our minds in the same way it\'s tied into the\r\natomic and electronic components. It\'s part of us and we\'re part of it."\r\n\r\nEven Maxon, crew authority on the combination drive, missed his meaning\r\nat first.\r\n\r\n"If our atomic shielding fails," Ragan explained, "we\'re irradiated.\r\nIf our psionics bank fails, we may feel anything. Maybe the trouble is\r\nthere."\r\n\r\nPrivately they disagreed, certain that nothing so disquieting as the\r\nFeeling that weighted them down could be induced even by so cryptic a\r\nmarriage of dissimilar principles as made up the ship\'s power plant.\r\nStill it was a possible avenue of relief.\r\n\r\n"It\'s worth trying," Maxon said, and they checked.\r\n\r\nAnd checked, and checked.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"We worked for hours," Walraven said, "but nothing came of it. None\r\nof us, even Maxon, knew enough about the psi-drive to be sure, but we\r\nended up certain that the trouble wasn\'t there. It was in us."\r\n\r\nThe drug was wearing thin, leaving him pale and shaken. His face had a\r\nglisten of sweat under the lowered lights.\r\n\r\nThe lead psych man chose a hypodermic needle, looked to Erwin and\r\nCostain for authority, and administered a second injection.\r\n\r\n"You gave up searching," he said. "What then, Lieutenant?"\r\n\r\n"We waited," Walraven said.\r\n\r\nHe relaxed, his face smoothing to impersonal detachment as his mind\r\nslipped back to the ship and its crew. Watching, Costain felt a sudden\r\ndeep unease as if the man\'s mind had really winged back through time\r\nand space and carried a part of his own with it.\r\n\r\n"There was only one more possible check," Walraven said. "We had to\r\nwait two days for that."\r\n\r\nThe check was Maxon\'s idea, simple of execution and unarguable of\r\nresult. At halfway point acceleration must cease, the ship rotate on\r\nits gyros and deceleration set in. There would be a period of waiting\r\nwhen the power plant must be shut off completely.\r\n\r\nIf the Feeling stemmed from the psi-drive, it would lift then.\r\n\r\nIt did not lift. They sat weightless and disoriented while the gyros\r\nprecessed and the ship swung end by end and the steady pressure of the\r\nFeeling mounted up and up without relief.\r\n\r\n"It gets worse every hour," Vaughn said raggedly.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not a matter of time," Maxon said. "It\'s the distance. The\r\nFeeling grows stronger as we get farther from home."\r\n\r\nThey sat for another time without talk, feeling the distance build up\r\nbehind them and sensing through the unwindowed hull of the ship what\r\nthe emptiness outside must be like. The ship was no longer an armored\r\nprojectile bearing them snugly and swiftly to a first planetfall. It\r\nwas a walnut shell without strength or direction.\r\n\r\nIn the end they talked out their problem because there was nothing else\r\nthey could do.\r\n\r\n"We\'re men," Maxon said, not as if he must convince himself but as if\r\nit were a premise that had to be made, a starting point for all logic.\r\n"We\'re reasoning creatures. If the trouble lies in ourselves we can\r\nfind its source and its reason for being."\r\n\r\nHe picked Vaughn first because Vaughn had been first to sense the\r\nwrongness and because the most sensitive link in a chain is also\r\npredictably its weakest.\r\n\r\n"Try," Maxon said. "I know there are no words to describe this thing,\r\nbut get as close as you can.

"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVaughn tried. "It isn\'t home-sickness. It\'s a different thing\r\naltogether from nostalgia. It\'s not just fear. I\'m afraid--not of any\r\n_thing_, just afraid in the way a child is afraid of falling in his\r\ndreams, when he\'s really had no experience with falling because he\'s\r\nnever fallen more than a few inches in his life.... When I think of my\r\nwife, it\'s not the same at all as if I were just in some far corner of\r\nthe Earth with only land and water between us. Even if I were marooned\r\non an uncharted island somewhere with no hope of seeing home again, I\r\nwouldn\'t feel this way. 

There wouldn\'t be this awful _pulling_."\r\n\r\nRagan agreed with Vaughn that the Feeling was essentially a _pull_, but\r\nbeyond agreement could add nothing. Ragan had covered the world without\r\nforming a tie to hold him; one place was as good as another and he\r\nfelt no loss for any particular spot on Earth.\r\n\r\n"I only want to be back there," he said simply. "Anywhere but here."\r\n\r\n"I was born on a farm in New England," Walraven said. "Out of the land,\r\nlike my father and his people before him. I\'m part of that land, no\r\nmatter how far from it I go, because everything I am came from it. I\r\nfeel uprooted. 

I don\'t belong here."\r\n\r\n_Uprooted_ was the key for which they had hunted.\r\n\r\nMaxon said slowly, "There are wild animals on Earth that can\'t live\r\naway from their natural homes. Insects--how does a termite feel, cut\r\noff from its hive? Maybe that\'s our trouble. 

Something bigger than\r\nindividual men made the human race what it is. Maybe we\'ve been a sort\r\nof composite being all along, without knowing it, tied together by the\r\nneed of each other and not able to exist apart. Maybe no one knew it\r\nbefore because no one was ever isolated in the way we are."\r\n\r\nWalraven had more to say, almost defiant in his earnestness. "This is\r\ngoing to sound wild, but I\'ve been fighting inside myself ever since\r\nVaughn mentioned being pulled toward home. I have the feeling that if\r\nI\'d only let go, I\'d be back where I belong." He snapped his fingers,\r\nthe sound loud in the room. 

"Like that."\r\n\r\nNo one laughed because each found in himself the same conviction\r\nwaiting to be recognized. Ragan said, "Walraven\'s right. There\'s no\r\nplace on Earth I care for more than another, but I feel I could be back\r\nthere in any one of them"--he snapped his fingers, as Walraven had\r\ndone--"as quickly as that."\r\n\r\n"I know," Maxon said. 

"But we can\'t let go. We were sent out to put\r\nthis ship into orbit around Mars. We\'ve got to take her there."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWalraven said, "It wasn\'t easy. The Feeling got worse as we went out\r\nand out. Knowing what it was helped a little, but not enough. We held\r\nonto each other, the four of us, to keep the group together. We _knew_\r\nwhat would happen if we let go."\r\n\r\nThe head psych man looked to Costain and put his needle away when\r\nCostain shook his head.\r\n\r\n"The ship," Coordinator Erwin said sharply. "Walraven, you did put her\r\ninto orbit?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," Walraven said. "We put her into orbit and turned on the\r\ntelemetering equipment--they\'ll be picking up her signals by now--and\r\nthen we turned our backs on each other and we let go. There wasn\'t any\r\nfeeling of motion or speed, but I felt a fresh breeze on my face and\r\nwhen I opened my eyes I was standing beside a familiar stone fence on\r\na hill above the house where I was born. You haven\'t told me, but the\r\nothers came back, too, didn\'t they?

"\r\n\r\n"All but Ragan," Erwin said. His tone made Costain think wryly, _Even\r\nthe military can snatch at straws_. "Maxon and Vaughn called in. But we\r\nhaven\'t heard from Ragan."\r\n\r\n"He wasn\'t left behind," Walraven said with certainty. "Ragan has no\r\nfamily, but he has a home. We\'re standing on it."\r\n\r\nAn orderly came in with an envelope for Costain, who opened it and\r\nhanded the paper to Erwin. To Walraven, Costain said, "It\'s a cablegram\r\nfrom North Ireland. Ragan is back."\r\n\r\nErwin was still gripping the paper in his hand when he walked with\r\nCostain out of the hospital into the bright airiness of a spring day.\r\nHe glared at the warm, blue sky.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll find a way," Erwin said. "We\'ve proved that we can put men on\r\nMars. With the right conditioning, we can keep them there."\r\n\r\n"You\'re a dedicated and resolute man, Coordinator," Costain said. 

"Do\r\nyou really suppose that any amount of conditioning could fit you to do\r\nwhat those boys failed at?"\r\n\r\nThe long moment of considering that passed before Erwin answered left a\r\nfine sheen of sweat on his face.\r\n\r\n"No," Erwin said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE FEELING ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\xe2\x80\x99s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
