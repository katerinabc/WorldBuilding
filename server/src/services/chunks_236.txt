They called it, naturally enough, The Sun--just as home\r\nwas Earth, Terra, or simply The World. And naturally enough, being the\r\nascendant animal on Earth, they called themselves human beings. They\r\nwere looking for extraterrestrial souls to save.\r\n\r\nThey had no real hope of finding humans like themselves in this\r\nwonderously diversified universe. But it wasn\'t against all probability\r\nthat, in their rumaging, there might not be a humanoid species to whom\r\nthey could reach down a helping paw; some emergent cousin with at least\r\na rudimentary symmetry from snout to tail, and hence a rudimentary soul.\r\n\r\nThe ship they chose was a compact scout, vaguely resembling the outside\r\nof an orange crate--except that they had no concept of an orange crate\r\nand, being a tesseract, it had no particular outside. It was simply an\r\nexpanding cube (and as such, quite roomy) whose "interior" was always\r\nparalleling its "exterior" (or attempting to), in accordance with all\r\nthe well-known, basic and irrefutable laws on the subject.\r\n\r\nA number of its sides occupied the same place at the same time, giving\r\na hypothetical spectator the illusion of looking down merging sets of\r\nrailway tracks. This, in fact, was its precise method of locomotion.\r\nThe inner cube was always having to catch up, caboose-fashion, with\r\nthe outer one in time (or space, depending on one\'s perspective).\r\nAnd whenever it had done so, it would have arrived with itself--at\r\napproximately wherever in the space-time continuum it had been pointed.\r\n\r\nWhen they felt the jar of the settling geodesics, the crew crowded at\r\nthe forward visiplate to see where they were. It was the outskirts of\r\na G type star system. Silently they watched the innermost planet float\r\npast, scorched and craggy, its sunward side seeming about to relapse to\r\na molten state.\r\n\r\nThe Bosun-Colonel turned to the Conductor. "A bit of a disappointment\r\nI\'m afraid, sir. 

Surely with all that heat...?"\r\n\r\n"Steady, lad. The last wicket\'s not been bowled." The Conductor\'s\r\nwhiskers quivered in amusement at his next-in-command\'s impetuosity.\r\n"You\'ll notice that we\'re dropping downward. If the temperature\r\naccordingly continues dropping--"\r\n\r\nHe couldn\'t shrug, he wasn\'t physiologically capable of it, but it was\r\napparent that he felt they\'d soon reach a planet whose climate could\r\nsupport intelligent life.\r\n\r\nIf the Bosun-Colonel had any ideas that such directions as up and\r\ndown were meaningless in space, he kept them to himself. As the second\r\nplanet from its sun hove into view, he switched on the magniscan\r\neagerly.\r\n\r\n"I say, this is more like it. 

Clouds and all that sort of thing. 

Should\r\nwe have a go at it, sir?"\r\n\r\nThe Conductor yawned. "Too bloody cloudy for my taste. 

Too equivocal.\r\nLet\'s push on," he said languidly. "I have a hunch the third planet\r\nmight be just our dish of tea."\r\n\r\nQuelling his disappointment, the Bosun-Colonel waited for the third\r\nplanet to swim into being. And when it did, blooming like an orchid\r\nin all its greens and moistnesses, he could scarcely contain his\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n"Why, it looks just like Earth," he marveled. "Gad, sir, what a master\r\nstroke of navigation. 

How did you realize this would be it?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know," the Conductor said modestly. "Things usually have\r\na habit of occurring in threes. I\'m quite a student of numerology, you\r\nknow." Then he remembered the Mission and drew himself erect on all his\r\nlegs. "You may prepare for landing, Mister," he ordered crisply.\r\n\r\nThe Bosun-Colonel shifted over to manual and busied himself at the\r\nhelm, luffing the square craft down the troughs of air. Gliding over\r\nthe vast tropical oceans, he put down at a large land mass above a\r\nshallow warm sea, twenty-five degrees below the northern pole.\r\n\r\nToo numbed for comment, the crew stared out at the alien vista. They\'d\r\nheard of retarded life forms from other Missionary expeditions--of\r\nplanets where the inhabitants, in extreme emergency, had been known\r\nto commit murder. But this was surely the worst, the most vicious\r\nimaginable in the galaxy.\r\n\r\nHere, with life freshly up from the sea, freshly launched on the long\r\nclimb to maturity and self-realization--was nothing but horror. With so\r\nlush a vegetation, so easily capable of supporting them side by side\r\nin abundance, the monsters were actually feeding on each other. Great\r\nlumbering beasts they were with their bristling hides and huge tails,\r\ncharging between the giant tree ferns; gouging living chunks from one\r\nanother while razor-toothed birds with scaly wings flapped overhead,\r\nscreaming for the remnants. As the sounds of carnage came through the\r\naudio ports, the youngest Oarsman keeled over in a faint.\r\n\r\nEven the Conductor was visibly shaken. The Bosun-Colonel turned to him\r\nwith a sick expression.\r\n\r\n"Surely it\'s a lost cause, Skipper. Life like this will never have a\r\nsoul worth saving.

"\r\n\r\n"Not in its present stage," the Old Man was forced to agree. "Still,\r\none never knows the devious paths that evolution takes." He considered\r\nthe scene for a thoughtful, shuddering interval. "Perhaps in several\r\nthousand millenniums...."\r\n\r\nThe Bosun-Colonel tried to visualize the possibility of Ethical Life\r\never materializing through these swamp mists, but the logic against it\r\nwas too insurmountable for the imagination.\r\n\r\n"Even so," he conceded, "granting the impossible--whatever shape it\r\ntook, the only worthwhile species would still be...." He couldn\'t bring\r\nhimself to say it.\r\n\r\n"Meat-eaters," the Conductor supplied grimly.\r\n\r\nOn hearing this, the Oarsman who had just revived promptly fainted\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"It\'s too deep in the genes," the Conductor continued, "too far\r\nadvanced for us to tamper with. All we can hope to do is modify their\r\nmoral outlook. 

So that by the time they achieve star travel, they\'ll at\r\nleast have a basic sense of Fair Play."\r\n\r\nSighing, bowed by responsibilities incommensurate with his\r\nchronological youth, he gave the order wearily. It was snapped down the\r\nchain of command to the Senior Yardbird:\r\n\r\n"All paws stand by to lower the Ethics Ray! Step lively, lads--bugger\r\noff, now...."\r\n\r\nThere was a din of activity as the outer locks were opened and the\r\nbulky mechanism was shipped over the side. It squatted on a cleared\r\nrise of ground in all its complex, softly ticking majesty, waiting for\r\nthe First Human to pad within range of its shedding Grace and Uplift.\r\nThe work party scrambled back to the ship, anxious to be off this\r\nsinister terrain. Once more the crew gathered at the visiplate as the\r\nplanet fell away beneath them, the Ethics Ray winking in the day\'s last\r\nlight like a cornerstone. Or perhaps a tambourine....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNight closed down on the raw chaotic world, huge beasts closed in on\r\nthe strange star-fallen souvenir. They snuffled over it; then enraged\r\nat discovering it was nothing they could fill their clamoring mindless\r\nstomachs with, attempted to wreck it. They were unsuccessful, for\r\nthe Machine had been given an extra heavy coat of shellac and things\r\nto withstand such monkeyshines. And the Machine, in its own finely\r\ncalibrated way, ignored its harassers, for they had no resemblance to\r\nthe Life it had been tuned to influence.\r\n\r\nDays lengthened into decades, eons. The seas came shouldering in to\r\nstand towers tall above the Ethics Ray, lost in the far ooze below.\r\nThen even the seas receded, and the mountains buckled upward in their\r\nplace, their arrogant stone faces staring changelessly across the\r\nepochs. Until they too were whittled down by erosion. The ice caps\r\ncrept down, crackling and grinding the valleys. The ground stretched\r\nand tossed like a restless sleeper, settled, and the Ethics Ray was\r\nbrought to light once more.\r\n\r\nAs it always had, it continued beaming its particular signal, on\r\na cosmic ray carrier modulated by a pulse a particular number of\r\nangstroms below infrared. The beasts that blundered within its field\r\nwere entirely different now, but they still weren\'t the Right Ones.\r\nAmong them were some shambling pale bipeds, dressed in skins of other\r\nbeasts, who clucked over its gleaming exterior and tried to chip it\r\naway for spearheads. In this of course they were unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nAnd then one day the First Human wandered by, paused square in the\r\npath of the beam. His physiology was only approximate, his I.Q. was\r\nregrettably low--but he was Pre-Moral Life, such as it was, on this\r\nplanet.\r\n\r\nThe Ethics Ray made the necessary frequency adjustments, tripped on\r\nfull force. The Primitive froze under the bombardment, its germ plasm\r\nshifting in the most minute and subtle dimensions. Then, its mission\r\nfulfilled, the Ethics Ray collapsed into heavy molecules and sank into\r\nthe ground. The first convert raced away in fright, having no idea what\r\nhad happened. Neither did his billion sons and daughters....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBack on the home base, the Conductor reported in at the Ethication of\r\nPrimitive Planets office. It was a magnificently imposing building,\r\nas befitting the moral seat of the universe. And the Overseer was an\r\nequally imposing human with ears greyed by service. His congratulations\r\nwere unreserved.\r\n\r\n"A splendid mission, lad," he said, "and I don\'t mind\r\nsuggesting--strictly entre nous--that it could jolly well result in a\r\nFleet Conductorship for you."\r\n\r\nThe Conductor was overwhelmed.\r\n\r\n"Now just let me jot down the essentials while they\'re still fresh in\r\nmind," he continued, pawing through a desk drawer. "Botheration! 

I seem\r\nto have traded the last of my styluses. Do you happen to have one on\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"With pleasure." The Conductor handed over his monogrammed gold stylus,\r\nreceiving in exchange a toy silencemaker.\r\n\r\n"My youngster traded it to me this morning," the Overseer chuckled.\r\n\r\nHe wrote rapidly for several moments, then gave the stylus back. The\r\nConductor found a weathered paper-weight in his rear pocket, which he\r\ntraded him for it. It looked like it might have come from this very\r\ndesk at one time. Then with a smart salute, he about-faced.\r\n\r\nOn the way out, a pair of secretaries paused in their trading of a pelt\r\nbrush for a tail-curler to watch him admiringly. As well they might.\r\nFleet Conductor!\r\n\r\nThe future Fleet Conductor of a solar system he would never think of\r\ncalling Antares paused at the door. In its polished panel he regarded\r\nhimself with due appreciation. He had sown the seeds of civilization on\r\na far-flung planet where, countless light years from now, they would\r\nflower to maturity. Not among the strongest or cleverest species, to\r\nbe sure, but among those most worthy of applying First Principles, the\r\nmoral law of give and take.\r\n\r\nAmong those remote cousins of the Conductor himself--who under no\r\ncircumstances would ever think of himself as resembling a rather\r\noversized trader rat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ETHICATORS ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\xe2\x80\x99s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
