And you\'re allowed\r\n only one mistake--your last!\r\n\r\n\r\nMy radar picked him up when he was about five hundred miles to my\r\nnorth-northeast and about forty-five miles above me. I switched the\r\nvelocity calculator on him as fast as I could reach it.\r\n\r\nThe enemy ship was doing sixteen, possibly even sixteen and a half. I\r\ntook the chance that it was most likely an Ivar Interceptor, at that\r\nspeed, and punched out a temporary evasion pattern with my right hand\r\nwhile with my left I snapped an Ivar K-12 card into my calculator along\r\nwith his estimated speed, altitude and distance. It wasn\'t much to go on\r\nas yet but he couldn\'t have much more on me, if as much; inwardly I\r\ncongratulated myself on the quick identification I\'d managed.\r\n\r\nHe was near enough now for my visor screen to pick him up. At least he\r\nwas alone, that was something. My nearest squadron mate was a good\r\nminute and a half away. It might as well have been a century.\r\n\r\nNow, this is what is always hard to get over to a civilian; the time\r\nelement. Understand, it will take me a while to tell this but it all\r\ntook less than sixty seconds to happen.\r\n\r\nHe had guessed my evasion pattern already--either guessed it or had some\r\nnew calculator that was far and beyond anything our techs were turning\r\nout. I could tell he\'d anticipated me by the Bong-Sonic roll he slipped\r\ninto.\r\n\r\nI quickly punched up a new pattern based on the little material I had in\r\nthe calculator. At least I\'d caught the roll. I punched that up,\r\nhurriedly, slipped it into the IBM, guessed that his next probability\r\nwas a pass, took a chance on that and punched it in.\r\n\r\nI was wrong there. He didn\'t take his opportunity for a front-on pass.\r\nHe was either newly out of their academy or insultingly confident. My\r\nlips felt tight as I canceled the frontal pass card, punched up two more\r\nto take its place.\r\n\r\nThe base supervisor cut in on the phone. "It looks like old Dmitri\r\nhimself, Jerry, and he\'s flying one of the new K-12a models. Go get him,\r\nboy!

"\r\n\r\nI felt like snapping back. He knew better than to break in on me at a\r\ntime like this. I opened my mouth, then shut it again. Did he say K-12a?\r\n_Did he say K-12a?_\r\n\r\nI squinted at the visor screen. The high tail, the canopy, the oddly\r\nshaped wing tanks.\r\n\r\nI\'d gone off on the identification!\r\n\r\nI slapped another evasion pattern into the controls, a standard set, I\r\nhad no time to punch up an improvisation. But he was on me like a wasp.\r\nI rejected it, threw in another set. 

Reject. Another!\r\n\r\nEven as I worked, I kicked the release on my own calculator, dumped it\r\nall, selected like a flash an Ivar K-12a card, and what other\r\nestimations I could make while my mind was busy with the full-time job\r\nof evasion.\r\n\r\nMy hands were still making the motions, my fingers were flicking here,\r\nthere, my feet touching here, there. But my heart wasn\'t in it.\r\n\r\nHe already had such an advantage that it was all I could do to keep him\r\nin my visor screen. 

He was to the left, to the right. I got him for a\r\nfull quarter-second in the wires, but the auto gunner was too far\r\nbehind, much too far.\r\n\r\nHis own guns flicked red.\r\n\r\nI punched half a dozen buttons, slapped levers, tried to scoot for home.\r\n\r\nTo the left of my cubicle two lights went yellowish and at the same time\r\nmy visor screen went dead. I was blind.\r\n\r\nI sank back in my chair, helpless.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe speed indicator wavered, went slowly, deliberately to zero; the\r\naltimeter died; the fuel gauge. Finally, even the dozen or so\r\ntrouble-indicators here, there, everywhere about the craft. Fifteen\r\nmillion dollars worth of warcraft was being shot into wreckage.\r\n\r\nI sat there for a long, long minute and took it.\r\n\r\nThen I got to my feet and wearily opened the door of my cubicle.\r\nSergeant Walters and the rest of the maintenance crew were standing\r\nthere. They could read in my face what had happened.\r\n\r\nThe sergeant began, "Captain, I ..."\r\n\r\nI grunted at him. "Never mind, Sergeant. It had nothing to do with the\r\nship\'s condition." I turned to head for the operations office.\r\n\r\nBill Dickson strolled over from the direction of his own cubicle.\r\n"Somebody said you just had a scramble with old Dmitri himself."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," I said. 

"I don\'t know if it was him or not. Maybe some\r\nof you guys can tell a man\'s flying but I can\'t."\r\n\r\nHe grinned at me. "Shot you down, eh?

"\r\n\r\nI didn\'t answer.\r\n\r\nHe said, "What happened?"\r\n\r\n"I thought it was an Ivar K-12, and I put that card in my calculator.\r\nTurned out it was one of those new models, K-12a. That was enough, of\r\ncourse.

"\r\n\r\nBill grinned at me again. "That\'s two this week. That flak got you near\r\nthat bridge and now you get ..."\r\n\r\n"Shut up," I told him.\r\n\r\nHe counted up on his fingers elaborately. "The way I figure it, you lose\r\none more ship and you\'re an enemy ace."\r\n\r\nHe was irrepressible. "Damn it," I said, "will you cut it out! I\'ve got\r\nenough to worry about without you working me over. This means I\'ll have\r\nto spend another half an hour in operations going over the fight. And\r\nthat means I\'ll be late for dinner again. And you know Molly."\r\n\r\nBill sobered. 

"Gee," he said, "I\'m sorry. War is hell, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Imagination Stories of Science and\r\n    Fantasy_ July 1953.

Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
