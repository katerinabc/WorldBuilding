TEICHNER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe machine had stood there a long time. It was several hundred feet\r\nlong and could run on a thimbleful of earth or water. Complete in\r\nitself, the machine drew material from the surrounding landscape,\r\ntransmuting matter to its special purposes. It needed sugar, salt, water\r\nand many other things but never failed to have them. It was still\r\nworking. And at the delivery end, where the packaging devices had been\r\nbroken down, it turned out a steady turgid stream on the ground of\r\npink-striped, twisting taffy.\r\n\r\nOnce the whole vast desert area had been filled with such devices,\r\nproducing all the varied needs of a very needful human race. But there\r\nhad been no machine to produce peace. The crossing shock waves of fused\r\nhydrogen had destroyed the machines by the tens of thousands, along with\r\nall the automatic shipping lines, leaving only, in the quirk of a\r\npressure cross-pattern, an undisturbed taffy-making machine, oozing its\r\nspecial lava on the plateau floor.\r\n\r\nIt had been working seven and a half million years.\r\n\r\nIt continued to repair itself, as if a child of the race that had\r\nstarted all this would come by it at any moment to tip an eager pinky in\r\nthe still-warm taffy to taste its tangy sweetness. But there were no\r\nhuman beings. There had been none since the day when the packager\r\ncollapsed, at the edge of the total-evaporation zone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCreno set a few of his legs on the edge of the glassy, weathered ridge\r\nand gazed over the plateau. Harta, next to him, trembled as she\r\nadjusted to the strange hardness of these four dimensions. "Being is a\r\nthin thing here," she said.\r\n\r\n"Thin, yes," Creno smiled. "An almost dead world. But there is a mystery\r\nin that almost to make the journey worth the coming."\r\n\r\n"What mystery?" But Creno was of the wisest on the home planet and her\r\nsense feelers scanned once more to find what he must mean. "I _do_ feel\r\nit! Everything dead but that one great mental thing moving, and a\r\nfour-dimensional stream coming out in the vibrations of this world!"\r\n\r\n"I have been watching it," said Creno. "What kind of life can that be?\r\nYou are a sharp sensor, Harta. Focus to it."\r\n\r\nShe strained and then relaxed, speaking: "The circuits are closed into\r\nthemselves. It learns nothing from outside itself except to move and\r\nextend its metal feelers for food. Soil is its food. Soil is its energy.\r\nSoil is its being."\r\n\r\n"Can it be alive?"\r\n\r\n"It is alive."\r\n\r\nAll his legs rested now in a row along the ridge. He too was relaxed as\r\none mystery disappeared. "I feel your feelings, but the thing is not\r\nalive. It is a machine."\r\n\r\n"I do not understand. A machine in the middle of a dead world?"\r\n\r\n"Whether we understand why or not, that is what it is--a machine."\r\n\r\nHarta throbbed with excitement. How could Creno be wrong? He knew\r\neverything as soon as the facts were in his mind. 

Yet here now were\r\nliving things crawling toward the machine, just like the excrescence at\r\none end but in no way a part of it! The feeling of _willed_ effort as\r\nthey crawled slowly toward it, white and pink striped, reaching grasping\r\nfeelers into the turgid product, taking it in, then rising on easing\r\nlegs as the food spread within them.\r\n\r\n"There _are_ living creatures here!" Creno pondered. 

"I feel your\r\nmessages. Twenty, thirty--a horde is crawling from that mountain toward\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Four thousand three hundred and ninety-one," said Harta. She\r\nconcentrated. "There are three thousand and five more in the mountain\r\ncaves, waiting to come out as the others return."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey came in groups of about a hundred, pulling themselves slowly toward\r\nthe edges of the great sticky lake that lay within the vaster area where\r\nthe pink matter dried and crumbled into the strong breeze. Some were\r\nsmaller than others, offspring who were nudged along by their elders.\r\nBut these small creatures were the ones who scampered most of all after\r\nthey had fed. Joyously they danced back toward the mountain. A few of\r\nmedium height went back in pairs, firm taffy fingers intertwined in each\r\nother.\r\n\r\n"They mate," said Creno. "It is their custom."\r\n\r\n"How tiring they are," said Harta. "I have lost interest. We have seen\r\nthirty-one worlds with such customs and these creatures are too simple\r\nto be interesting. Let us go home or try some other system.

"\r\n\r\n"Not yet," Creno insisted. "We passed through the ocean and surveyed the\r\nlands of this tiny planet. Nowhere else has there been the tiniest unit\r\nof life. Why at this one spot should something exist?"\r\n\r\n"But we have several parallel situations," Harta protested. "They were\r\ncolonies landed in one spot by the civilization of another planet. They\r\nlanded here with their feeder machine. 

And that is the explanation."\r\n\r\n"Your mind does not function well in a four-dimension continuum, Harta.\r\nYou will need more training--"\r\n\r\n"But these cases are rare, and, Creno--"\r\n\r\n"I know they are rare, my child. But still they exist. 

You will have to\r\nlearn eventually, a little at a time. Now then, it is a rule of such\r\nlimited dimensional realms that the movement of matter and events from\r\nplace to place is highly difficult. Certain compacting procedures must\r\nbe observed. To transport a machine this size across their space would\r\nhave required enormous effort and an intelligence they do not yet have.\r\nMore than that, it would have been unnecessary. A smaller device would\r\nhave supplied them with food. I am forced to conclude that--somehow--we\r\nare approaching this problem backwards."\r\n\r\n"Backwards? You mean they made the machine here after they came?"\r\n\r\nHe did not reply to that. "We must concentrate together on thinking\r\nourselves into their functioning in their manifold."\r\n\r\nHarta followed his suggestion, and soon their thoughts were moving among\r\nand within the striped creatures. The insides of their bodies consisted\r\nof fundamentally the same taffy substance; but it had been modified by\r\nvarious organic structures. All, though, were built of the same\r\nfundamental units: elongated, thin cells which readily aligned\r\nthemselves in semi-crystalline patterns.\r\n\r\n"Enough," Creno said, "back to the hill."\r\n\r\nTheir rows of thin limbs rested on the ridge crest once more. "We have\r\nseen such cell crystals before," she sighed. "The inefficiencies in such\r\na poverty of dimensions! Do you still think we have looked at it\r\nbackwards?

"\r\n\r\n"Of course we have. They did not bring the machine or make it--the\r\nmachine made them!"\r\n\r\n"That is not possible, Creno, great as you are in these matters. We have\r\nnever seen life created by a machine before. No one ever has, from the\r\nmillions of reports I have seen at home."\r\n\r\n"Maybe we have and not known it. The life we have seen always evolved\r\nthrough enormous eons and we could not see its origins clearly in most\r\ncases. Here we are dealing with something that has taken comparatively\r\nlittle time." He stopped, shocked that he, an elder, had said so much.\r\n"No, disregard such theories. You are still too young to bother with\r\nthem. Here is the important thing--this machine was left by an earlier\r\nrace that disappeared. Everything else was destroyed but it went right\r\non producing its substance."\r\n\r\n"The substance is not life."\r\n\r\n"It is only four-dimensional matter, right. But over a long enough\r\ntime--you know this as well as I do--random factors will eventually\r\nproduce a life form. By some trick of radiation this process has been\r\nspeeded up here. The substance the machine produces has in turn produced\r\nlife!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCreno sensed with a tremor some dangerous shifting in Harta\'s\r\nconsciousness. As an elder it was his duty to prevent a premature\r\ninsight in the young. It had been a mistake to bring this up. 

He must go\r\nno further.\r\n\r\nIt was not necessary. Harta took it up for him.\r\n\r\n"Then any substance producing life and modified by it could--if you go\r\nfar enough back--be the product of a machine. But it would have taken so\r\nlong to produce life that the original matter, that bore the direct\r\nimprint of the machine, would have disappeared."\r\n\r\n"An error," said Creno desperately. "There is just this case."\r\n\r\n"By the time these creatures have arrived at self-knowledge the machine\r\nwill be gone. They will not know it ever existed, and--"\r\n\r\n"That is all it means. 

There is just this one case. Now we must leave\r\nthis unimportant example of minor dimensions!"\r\n\r\nHe strained consciousness to a forward movement but Harta remained\r\nbehind. 

He had to pull back. "Start," he ordered.\r\n\r\nHer mind\'s obstinately frozen stance made him freeze too. He applied all\r\nhis force to bring her back into control, but she still held fast.\r\n\r\n"Something more is hidden from me. 

I will be back," she said. And she\r\ndisappeared from the ridge.\r\n\r\nHe had never faced such a quandary before on a training trip with a\r\nyounger one. If he went in pursuit he would find her ultimately--that\r\nwas in the nature of being older and wiser--but, if she revolted against\r\nhis pursuit, she could extend the time considerably on this forsaken\r\nplanet. And he wanted to get her away as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThe more time here the more chance that the awful truth would come to\r\nher before her time.\r\n\r\nHe watched the growing waves of creatures floundering toward the vast\r\noozing puddle, which refilled itself as quickly as it was diminished by\r\nthem, and the receding waves of those that had already fed. This, he\r\ncould see, was an endless process. The whole life of the species moved\r\nin continuous systole-diastole around the machine.\r\n\r\nSoon he would have to go in search of her.\r\n\r\nBut then she was back at his side, her being for this world once more\r\nsolidified. She concentrated for a moment on the pink-striped waves of\r\nrippling inward and outward around the great sustaining pool, then\r\ncommunicated with him.\r\n\r\n"We can leave now. There is nothing more to see."\r\n\r\nSomething in her mind remained closed to his, as the mind of younger\r\nnever should be to older. But at least he could see with relief that the\r\nworst had not happened. 

The deeper knowledge had not arrived to her too\r\nearly when it could only hurt. All he found turned to him--as they\r\nreceded from this thin-manifold universe, then moved up the dimension\r\nladder to their home level--was a surface of happiness.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, though, as they prepared for flight in that hyperspace all her\r\njoy was gone.\r\n\r\n"I saw it," she said. "In my free and unrestricted spirit I moved deep\r\ninto the substance of that world, below all the total ruin, far below.\r\nAnd there was a monstrous machine, near the molten core, almost\r\ninfinitely older than the feeding one far above it. And it, too, had\r\nbeen left in a stratum where all else was destroyed. I could see it had\r\nonce produced the ooze from which came the life from which in turn come\r\nthe beings by whom the machine above it was made. Maybe they, too,\r\nthought they were free and unrestricted!"\r\n\r\nHe sighed for the bitter cost of knowledge.\r\n\r\nThis one would no longer go forth in the joy of mere exploration, and he\r\nwould no longer live vicariously in the happiness of another being\'s\r\ninnocence. Now Harta, too, would be seeking the answer to the question\r\nof original creation, the answer that he had not found in his journeys\r\nacross a myriad worlds and dimensions....\r\n\r\nThat no one had ever found.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s Sweet Their Blood and Sticky, by Albert Teichner\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SWEET THEIR BLOOD AND STICKY ***\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!)

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\xe2\x80\x99s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
