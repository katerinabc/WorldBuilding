It was surprisingly large compared to the aircraft native\r\nto this planet, and yet ridiculously small to have brought enough men\r\nand material to launch an invasion across light years of space.\r\n\r\nThe landing went unobserved in this fearful year of 1955. The world\r\nfaced too many crucial crises of their own making to consider the\r\nnecessity to be watchful for an extra-terrestrial invasion.\r\n\r\nHardly had the craft come to rest, when the outer lock slid noiselessly\r\nopen and a small ladder-like stairway came down until it too had\r\ntouched earth.\r\n\r\nA man appeared in the doorway, pausing to study the landscape which\r\nlay before him. His features, his body, were human. Despite his being\r\ntoo well muscled, and his face unusually handsome, he would never have\r\naroused suspicion of being from another planet.\r\n\r\nGrunting in satisfaction, he permitted himself the pleasure of being\r\nproud at having landed so near the cabin chosen as his goal. It had\r\nbeen a wise choice, this picking of so well isolated a place as a\r\ntesting ground for the weapon. A wisp of smoke, a dark smudge against\r\nthe rich blueness of the sky, attested to the cabin\'s occupancy. What\r\nhe was about to do seemed fitting, for even the scientists of this\r\nplanet had used animal life to test their own puny weapons. Now he,\r\nman, would be the guinea pig to prove the devastation to be wrought\r\nagainst all mankind native to this world.\r\n\r\nHe turned and spoke to someone within the lock. His language, while\r\nresembling no earthly tongue, was not much different than perhaps\r\nEnglish to Chinese. It was foreign but not completely alien.\r\n\r\nWith the ease of a man accustomed to heavier gravity he went down the\r\nladder easily, turning when he reached the ground to look up at the\r\nlock.\r\n\r\nAnd then to the edge of the air lock, she came--the weapon! There had\r\nbeen no doubt in the minds of her creators as to her effectiveness--she\r\nwould conquer this planet. The armed might of Earth would vanish\r\nbefore her. Before the year had ended the invasion would have been\r\naccomplished. As a weapon, the Earth\'s H-Bomb might well be a mere\r\nfirecracker. She had been tested against the men of her own planet and\r\nfound to be irresistible, but now would come the final test against the\r\nenemy without laboratory-controlled conditions.\r\n\r\nThe planet she had come from is unimportant, suffice to say their\r\ntechnology had conquered space over a thousand years ago. For over\r\nhalf that time they had subjugated neighboring worlds until their rule\r\nhad spread to the borders of Earth. Scouting ships had been spying on\r\nEarth for the past two centuries and had brought back alarming reports\r\nconcerning the rapidly expanding technology of this planet.\r\n\r\nSoon after the aliens had discovered the secret of space flight had\r\ncome the added knowledge planets could be conquered by other than the\r\nforce of arms. Psychological warfare had been developed to a fantastic\r\ndegree, making weapons more potent than any bombs of fissionable\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nThere she stood, a monument to her creators. Eve, soon to be conqueror\r\nof the planet Earth.\r\n\r\nTo attempt description of her beauty would be an impossibility, for the\r\nlanguages of man do not contain the necessary word-symbols to express\r\nthe utter perfection of her face and form. To each man she would appear\r\ndifferent, for he would see in her the substance of his unconscious\r\ndesires for the woman he had never dreamed might exist. For this\r\npurpose the scientists had labored in their laboratories for nearly a\r\nhalf century, and now she would justify the time and effort spent in\r\nher creation.\r\n\r\nGently, she smiled at the man waiting below, and despite the special\r\nconditioning he had undergone, and the drugs he took with careful\r\nregularity for added protection, he almost surrendered to the impulse\r\nto throw himself at her feet; to beg for only the privilege to serve\r\nher, to obey her, and to worship her.\r\n\r\nOut of the entire space fleet, he, Commander Ydnas, after extensive\r\npsychological testing, had been selected for this task. The three\r\nmonths of conditioning had passed rapidly, his response to the\r\ntreatments had been better than they had dared to hope. 

In the two\r\nweeks of their flight he had been unaffected by her presence, and now\r\nupon landing he was beginning to feel the strain he was under. He\r\nwondered what would have happened had it not been for the added help of\r\nthe drugs?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHis face betrayed none of the anxiety he now felt. It was an impassive\r\nmask, his body was ramrod tense and erect.\r\n\r\nShe came down the steps gracefully, her litheness would have made the\r\nmovements of a cat seem awkward and clumsy.\r\n\r\nBoth had been thoroughly trained in the languages needed to carry out\r\nthe plan of invasion, English and Russian. First, the large continent\r\nof North America would be disarmed at her command; and then they would\r\nmove across the large body of water to Europe. Russia would be their\r\ninitial target there. The invasion timetable called for a three month\r\ncampaign, and then Eve would be removed from the planet before the\r\noccupation fleet from the mother world would land. Not a man would be\r\nlost, nor a space ship damaged, and yet the planet\'s rich potential\r\nwould be theirs for the taking.\r\n\r\nAnd what of Eve? She was too dangerous to be permitted to return to her\r\ncreators. Commander Ydnas had his instructions covering the final phase\r\nof the invasion plan. When her task of disarming Earth was completed,\r\nand the planet lay helpless to defend itself, they would blast off into\r\nspace together. Soon as Earth\'s atmosphere was left behind, she would\r\nbe slain, her body incinerated through the rocket tubes.\r\n\r\nIt seemed such a dreadful waste to destroy such beauty of perfection,\r\nbut the Commander, raised from infancy to be a space officer, realized\r\nthe need for her disposal. After the need for a weapon has passed, it\r\nis safer to destroy it then risk the danger of trying to store it. Even\r\non this world they dumped their poison gases into the seas and did the\r\nsame with the more volatile explosives.\r\n\r\n"Come," he said, starting toward the cabin. When she would have taken\r\nhis hand, he brushed it aside angrily. 

Even the work the psychologists\r\nhad done to condition him, and the strength of the drugs, could be\r\ntrusted only up to a point. He feared what her touch might do to the\r\niron discipline with which he kept himself in check.\r\n\r\nThe only response to his rebuff, was a shrug of those magnificently\r\nrounded shoulders, and a lazy half-smile of amusement.\r\n\r\nHer creators had considered it a bit of ironic humor to name her so\r\noutlandish and yet befitting a name as Eve. For her namesake too had\r\nbeen a temptress bringing about the calamities of mankind, and now eons\r\nlater another Eve would end the supremacy of man.\r\n\r\nAt the door of the cabin the commander paused. His eyes sought those of\r\nthe woman. She stood regarding him strangely, and for the first time he\r\nfound himself wondering what she must feel about her part in bringing\r\nabout the defeat of a world? She had no control over her actions. She\r\nwas conditioned to follow the tenets of the master plan. He wished he\r\nhad not held himself so aloof from her during the flight. Now there was\r\nno time to question what she felt. And after the invasion for her there\r\nwould be only destruction.\r\n\r\nAnnoyed with himself, he turned back to the door, his knuckles sounded\r\ndully against the thickness of the wood. 

He waited impatiently,\r\nreceiving no answer to his knocking. With one hand near the weapon in\r\nhis belt, he reached out and lifted the latch.\r\n\r\nGesturing for Eve to remain outside, he stepped over the threshold.\r\n\r\nA man dozed in the large chair before the still smouldering fireplace.\r\nWhen the cool air reached him he shivered and opened his eyes.\r\n\r\n"I am Commander Ydnas."\r\n\r\nThe man gazed at him blankly, his sleep-stained face bewildered at the\r\nrude awakening. He seemed unimpressed by the military splendor of the\r\ncommander\'s uniform.\r\n\r\nThe commander eyed the man with mild contempt. This would do as a\r\nguinea pig to prove the effectiveness of Eve. Here too would be an\r\nexcellent base of operations. The man could supply many useful details\r\nneeded before the invasion could begin.\r\n\r\n"Eve," he called. "Come in!"\r\n\r\nShe entered the room reluctantly, her gaze pitying the man seated so\r\nstrangely still in his chair. She waited for his expression to change\r\nwhen he saw her. 

In a moment he would be grovelling at her feet. Eve\r\nhated what she was doing, but the patterns implanted in her brain by\r\nthe creators made it impossible for her to resist.\r\n\r\nThe Commander\'s stern jaw relaxed, his mouth fell open in shock.\r\nImpossible! Incredible! The man continued to remain motionless,\r\nregarding them with annoyed perplexity.\r\n\r\nThe scientists had blundered; earth beings were not creatures governed\r\nby their emotions. The data collected by the spy ships had been\r\nerroneous, the invasion would fail.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nInstinctively he looked to the woman. Eve watched him in open\r\namusement, and he wondered if he had not caught a glimpse of sympathy\r\nin her eyes. She knew what this meant to him. No man returned to the\r\nmother planet in defeat. If he did not follow the time-honored custom\r\nof self-destruction to atone for his failure, he would face a quick\r\ndeath when he returned.\r\n\r\n"What--what did you want?" asked the man, annoyance making his voice a\r\npetulant whine.\r\n\r\n"Nothing, sir. We made a mistake. 

I\'m afraid we came to the wrong\r\nplace."\r\n\r\nThe Commander turned to Eve, his face transformed by a smile for the\r\nfirst time since they had been together.\r\n\r\n"I know of an asteroid that is pretty well out of the space lanes. It\r\nhas an atmosphere and can support life without a great struggle on our\r\npart. 

Do you think you could like it there? Of course, it wouldn\'t be\r\nmuch of a world for you to conquer, and I would be the only man to\r\nserve you ... but...."\r\n\r\nShe studied him thoughtfully, and then in answer to what he had asked,\r\nshe took his arm. They left the cabin together, walking very closely.\r\n\r\nIt must have seemed a cosmic joke to the gods of the universe to see\r\nthe invader and the woman, who was to have been his weapon, pause and\r\nwave a casual farewell to the planet they had come to conquer.\r\n\r\n"Asteroid," the man mused aloud. "What kind of crazy gibberish had they\r\nbeen talking? 

Must be honeymooners from one of the nearby resorts."\r\n\r\nHe shrugged in an attempt to dismiss it from his mind, maybe he ought\r\nto ask Helen about it when she got back. Come to think of it she should\r\nbe back with the supplies any minute now.\r\n\r\nThere was a strange roar from outside, and the sound of some great\r\nobject hurtling through the air, but strangely enough the man did\r\nnot leap from his chair and rush to the door to see what created the\r\ndisturbance.\r\n\r\nHe did not move from the fireplace until the chill had begun to fill\r\nthe cabin, and then reluctantly he stood up fumbling along the side of\r\nthe chair for some object leaning against it.\r\n\r\nWhen he located it, he grasped it tightly, and then made his way\r\ncautiously to the door. He shifted the stick to his left hand fumbling\r\nfor the latch. Locating it he closed the door.\r\n\r\nThe invaders had come ... and left in defeat. But the victor would\r\nnever know he had beaten off the first invasion of Earth, saving\r\nmankind from slavery and civilization from destruction. To him they\r\nwere mere voices babbling meaningless words. The splendor of their\r\nspace ship, the wondrous fatal beauty of the woman never would be known\r\nto him ... for he was totally blind!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ULTIMATE EVE ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!)

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\xe2\x80\x99s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
