H. LESLIE\r\n\r\n\r\n    _It is said that Life crawled up from the slime of the sea-bottoms\r\n    and became Man because of inherent greatness bred into him before\r\n    the dawn of time. But perhaps this urge was not as formless as we\r\n    think._\r\n\r\n\r\nBuos was chastising Laloi as they sped through the ionosphere of the\r\ngreen planet. But like the airy creature she was, Laloi ignored the\r\ncriticism and rippled zephyr-like through a clump of daffodils when they\r\ncompleted their descent.\r\n\r\n"So pretty," she sighed. She flung her incorporeal substance around each\r\nflower, absorbing their unified beauty of scent, sight, and feel. Buos\r\nshrilled himself into a column of wind to express his displeasure at her\r\nattitude.\r\n\r\n"Stupid, silly, shallow thing!" he said. "If the others only knew how\r\nyou behaved--"\r\n\r\n"And you\'ll be glad to tell them, of course," she said, extending her\r\nfingers of air into the roots of the wind-bent grass. She rolled across\r\nthe hill ecstatically, and Buos followed in grumbling billows of energy.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t carry tales," he replied, somewhat mortified. "But we\'re here\r\nas observers, and you insist upon making this world a plaything ..."\r\n\r\n"I love it," she said happily. "It\'s so warm and green."\r\n\r\nBuos whipped in front of her angrily. "This is an assignment," he\r\nsnapped, his emotion crackling the air about him. "We have a purpose\r\nhere."\r\n\r\n"Purpose!" she groaned, settling over a patch of crowded clover. "How\r\nmany centuries will this assignment last?"\r\n\r\n"This world is young," said Buos. "It will take time."\r\n\r\n"But how long?" she asked mournfully. "Our world will be shrivelled and\r\ndead before these people have the knowledge to rescue us. Why can\'t we\r\nspend our lives here ..."\r\n\r\n"And leave the others behind?" said Buos stiffly. "Selfish being," he\r\nsaid sadly. "This world cannot support one-fourth our number."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I know, I know," Laloi said.

"I do not mean to say such things. I\r\nam twisted by my sorrow ..." As if to express her self-abnegation, she\r\ncorkscrewed out of the clover and into a thin spiral of\r\nnear-nothingness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Settle down, foolish one," said Buos, not unkindly. "I know your\r\nfeelings. Do you think I am not tormented as well, by the slow pace of\r\nthese Earth-things? Crude, barbaric beings, like children with the\r\nbuilding blocks of science. They have such a long way to go ..."\r\n\r\n"And so few _know_," said Laloi despairingly. "A handful of seeing\r\nminds, tens of millions of ignorant ones. Not even first\r\nprinciples--they\'re stupid, stupid!"\r\n\r\n"But they will learn," Buos said stubbornly. "That is historical fact.\r\nSomeday, they will know the true meanings of matter and light and\r\nenergy. Slowly, yes, slowly. But in terms of their growth, it will seem\r\nlike great speed to them ..."\r\n\r\n"And in terms of our world," said Laloi, spinning sadly over the ground,\r\n"they may be far too late ..."\r\n\r\n"No!" In his excitement, Buos forgot himself and entwined with the\r\nflowing form of the she-creature, and the result was a rending of the\r\nair that cracked like heat lightning over the field. "No," he repeated\r\nagain. "They must not be too late. They must learn. They must build from\r\nthe very ground, and then they must fly. And then their eyes must be\r\nlifted to the stars, and desire must extend them to all the universe ..."\r\n\r\n"It seems so hopeless--"\r\n\r\n"It cannot be! Our destiny is not extinction. They must come to us, in\r\nfleets of silver, and replant our soil, and send towers of green\r\nshooting into our sky, breathing out air."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes!" Laloi cried pitifully. "It will be that way, Buos. It will\r\nbe that way! That man-creature, we will begin with him ..."\r\n\r\nBuos floated earthward disconsolately. "He is a dreamer," he said\r\ncheerlessly. "His mind is good; he thinks of tomorrow; he is one of the\r\nknowing ones. But he cannot be moved, Laloi. His thoughts may fester and\r\ndie in the prison of his brain ..."\r\n\r\n"No, they will not! We have watched him. He understands much. He will\r\nhelp us!"\r\n\r\n"I have seen his like before," said Buos hopelessly. "He thinks and he\r\nworks, and his conclusions will die stillborn, for lack of a moving\r\nforce ..."\r\n\r\n"Then let us provide it, Buos. Let us move him!"\r\n\r\n"With what?" 

=== Chunk 3 ===
said the other disdainfully. "Arms of nothing? Hands of\r\nvacuum? A breeze against his cheek? A rustle of leaves? A meaningless\r\nwhistle in his ear?"\r\n\r\n"Let us try. Let us try! This empty watchfulness is destroying us. Let\r\nus move him, Buos. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Come!"\r\n\r\nFaster than the sky-sweeping clouds they flew, over the gently swelling\r\nhills, over the yearning branches of the trees, over the calm blue\r\nwaters of the lakes. Swifter than the flight of birds they came,\r\nsearching for a thinking mind ...\r\n\r\nThey found him at last.\r\n\r\n"He knows, he knows," said Laloi. "Only now to say \'this is so because\'\r\nand \'this must happen when\'! Only to think--to understand--"\r\n\r\nThey hovered over his head, in a pandemonium of helplessness. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
They\r\nwhirled, and tumbled, and shrilly circled. And then to Laloi the\r\ninspiration came.\r\n\r\nThe apple, caught by a sudden gust of wind, twisted from the tenuous\r\nhold of the tree and fell to the ground.\r\n\r\nThe man, startled, picked it up.\r\n\r\nHe gazed at it, deep in thought.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ January 1957.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.
