To his\r\nbusiness associates he was a sober, calculating entrepreneur, given\r\noccasionally to rash ventures which through outrageous turns of luck\r\nusually ended well. To his employees he was a distant, ominous figure,\r\nwandering through his electronics plant occasionally, staring with pale\r\nblue eyes at a myriad of trivial details, sifting through the reject\r\nbox of discarded transistors and occasionally stopping to ask a loaded\r\nbut seemingly innocuous question of one of the production engineers.\r\nTo his housekeeper he was a brusque, harsh man, not given overly to\r\nentertaining or keeping late hours but sober, sedate and completely\r\nabsorbed in his pervasive habit of collecting automata.\r\n\r\nVery few men had ever seen the eyes of Amos Handworthy come aglow\r\nand Manny Steinberg was one of them. Manny was a superb engineer who\r\ncombined the ability to carry out a sophisticated circuit design with\r\nthe old fashioned desire to tinker. It was almost physically painful\r\nfor him to pass by a mechanical device that was not in working order.\r\nAnd so, in his first visit to the Pecos Saloon, a town landmark that\r\nhad been restored to its pristine d\xc3\xa9cor through the generosity of Amos\r\nHandworthy, Manny caught sight of the magnificent music making machine\r\nas soon as he cut through the swinging doors. He proceeded first to\r\nthe bar and availed himself of the tequila and lemon juice which was\r\nthe specialty of the house. Much of the town showed the influence of\r\nits close location to the Mexican border, the large Spanish speaking\r\npopulation, the frijoles that were vended off street carts, and the\r\ntastes in liquor.\r\n\r\nStill sucking on the lemon, Manny walked over and surveyed the glass\r\nenclosed music maker, four vertical violins arrayed in a circle\r\nwith a hoop of horse hair spanning about the four violin bridges,\r\nelectromagnet stops hovering above the strings. A dried out square of\r\npaper had been crudely taped across the glass with the clear inked\r\ninscription, "Out of Order." He had removed the back door of the\r\nmachine and was examining the innards when he felt a proprietary hand\r\non his shoulder and swivelled about to meet the questioning gaze of his\r\nboss, Amos Handworthy.\r\n\r\n"I think I can make it go," said Manny, not certain that he could but\r\nunable to leave this marvelous array of gears, levers, and multi-pinned\r\nrotating disks.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve tried to have it repaired and failed," said Amos Handworthy.\r\n"But if you can do it, it\'s worth a thousand dollars to me."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nManny nodded as though this offer had tipped the balance but in truth\r\nit made very little difference to him. Even the following week, when he\r\ndemonstrated to a full saloon how beautifully the four violins played\r\nthe Mephisto Waltz, he accepted the check which Amos Handworthy placed\r\nin his hand with some puzzlement, not quite connecting it with the\r\nmaintenance miracle he had just wrought. Handworthy insisted on having\r\nthe machine play again and again, but after the fourth successful\r\nround, Manny had lost interest in the device and was more concerned in\r\ndowning tequilas than in listening to the music.\r\n\r\nLater that night, as he lay abed on a rumpled sweat-wet sheet,\r\nwondering how in hell he had taken a job in this God-forsaken town in\r\nTexas, he remembered dimly that his boss, Mr. Handworthy, had invited\r\nhim over to the stately Handworthy Mansion. He was not sure when the\r\ninvitation was for, or whether the occasion was of a business or social\r\ncharacter, but he knew that it was mandatory that he come.\r\n\r\nFortunately, a handwritten note on gray, unembossed letter paper\r\narrived the following day, confirming the invitation and specifying a\r\ndinner date the following Friday evening at eight P.M. Manny\'s income\r\nwas a good one and he had eaten in some of the finest restaurants in\r\nthe country but he had never been to the home of a truly wealthy man\r\nbefore. It was with no little trepidation that he appeared at the\r\ndoor of the Handworthy Mansion and was ushered into the house by the\r\nliveried butler who was, to Manny\'s intense surprise, white.\r\n\r\nHe was somewhat taken aback to find that he was the only dinner guest\r\nand that the burden of making conversation would be totally his job.\r\nBut he found that contrary to his expectation, Amos Handworthy did\r\nalmost all of the talking.\r\n\r\nThe food was plentiful but not lavish or exotic in character. Mr.\r\nHandworthy himself carved out liberal slices off the huge side of\r\nbeef that was brought in on a great silver salver. And although Mr.\r\nHandworthy did not drink it, the wine was carefully chilled and of good\r\n(but not the best) quality.\r\n\r\nSince Manny had been raised in a low income Jewish inhabited section of\r\nNew York City and had, despite his extensive rootless shifting about\r\nthe country, no real insight into how anybody else lived, he found\r\nhimself quite taken with the rambling tales that Amos Handworthy told\r\nof his town\'s history.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"My father," said Amos Handworthy toward the close of the dinner, "was\r\none of the last frontier marshals and maybe _the greatest_. His draw\r\nwas reputed to be so fast that the eye could barely follow it and he\r\nnever missed his target."\r\n\r\n"But he drank like a fish," he thought, "and spent most of his time at\r\nthe sporting house on East Maple."\r\n\r\n"As a boy," he said aloud, "I could think of nothing more ideal than to\r\nfollow in his footsteps when I grew up. Course, when I _had_ grown up,\r\nthere was no more frontier, no more show downs in the center of town.\r\nIt was a terrible disappointment and one that I haven\'t gotten over,\r\neven yet."\r\n\r\n"My father," said Manny pensively, "claimed that I had clumsy wooden\r\nhands. He was wrong and I think he knew it. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
But he\'d never admit it to\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"Do you know what disturbs me?" said Amos Handworthy. "There have been\r\nchallenges for me, some financial, some physical, others social, and\r\nI\'ve met and beaten every one of them. But I\'ve never been in the same\r\nmother naked kind of situation my Father had to meet where it was one\r\nman\'s raw courage and skill against another\'s."\r\n\r\n"The thing that disturbs me," said Manny, "is that whenever I knock\r\noff a particularly tough job, instead of being elated, I\'m totally\r\ndepressed until the next challenging one comes along."\r\n\r\nAmos Handworthy raised the wine bottle to the light and studied the\r\nplay of color through the thickened glass.\r\n\r\n"Come inside," he said abruptly. "I\'ve got something special I want to\r\nshow you."\r\n\r\nManny followed after his host and found himself in a huge, high\r\nceilinged room flanked on all four walls by reward posters, some as\r\nmuch as one hundred years old. There were no furnishings in the room,\r\njust a series of unusual pieces of furniture that proved on closer\r\nscrutiny to be automata of diverse types. In the center of the room was\r\na great amorphous mass covered by an enormous sheet.\r\n\r\n"I have no kin," said Handworthy, staring possessively about him. "I\'ve\r\nnever married so I have no children. But I\'m a happy man nevertheless.\r\nThese are my children," he said, gesticulating about him. "This one, is\r\na particular delight," he added, his voice swelling with pride as he\r\nbrought Manny over for a closer view.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was a gray enamelled case surmounted by a glistening blue hemisphere\r\nadorned with tiny stars of silver and gold. Within the hemisphere\r\nwas an exquisite miniature ball room, the walls lined with mirrors,\r\nand when Handworthy wound up the movement and released the catch, two\r\ngroups of tiny dancers began to waltz toward each other. Their images\r\nwere caught up and multiplied an hundred-fold in the mirrors creating a\r\ntruly breathtaking sight as the unseen strings of a harp were plucked\r\nbelow in the gray enamelled case.\r\n\r\nBefore Manny could comment, he was whisked over to a superbly crafted\r\nwooden figure of a charming child, a painted smile wreathing the gently\r\ncarved mouth. The child was seated on a mahogany stool and when the\r\nlatching hook had been lowered, it leaned forward and after dipping a\r\nfeathered pen into an ink-well, began to write in smooth cursive flow.\r\nWhen she leaned back, her motions apparently brought to a close, Manny\r\nbent forward and found to his intense amazement a beautifully crafted\r\nletter of some fifty words written to the mother of the child.\r\n\r\nThere were other amazing sights, an android that fingered and breathed\r\nwind into a flute that played sweetly, a reclining Cleopatra that\r\nrose, bowed gravely at the waist and then lay down once more upon her\r\nfeathered couch. Since each of the treasured machines was in perfect\r\nfunctioning order, Manny rapidly lost interest and merely followed\r\nHandworthy about, nodding politely, his mind distant upon a persistent\r\ncircuit problem that was still unsolved. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
But he was jarred back to\r\nreality when, with the reverence that one would use to lay bare a\r\nsleeping nymph, Handworthy removed the sheet from the huge centerpiece\r\nof the room. It was a small segment of a Western street, complete with\r\nhitching post, before which stood an uncannily lifelike figure of a\r\ntown marshal, complete with vest and badge, chaps and holstered gun.\r\nThe painted face was scowling and from closer scrutiny it was apparent\r\nthat the figure was capable of complex motion.\r\n\r\n"The others," said Amos Handworthy, "are marvelous antiques that\r\nI\'ve collected, but this fellow was made to my own specifications in\r\nSwitzerland. His clothing is quite authentic and he really works. Watch\r\nthis!"\r\n\r\nHe stepped forward and took a loosely draped gun belt off the hitching\r\npost to the right of the Marshal and buckled it about his waist.\r\n\r\n"The device is electrically operated," he continued. "The instant I\r\ndraw, the Marshal draws too, and the trick is to hit him somewhere on\r\nhis target photocells with a beam of light that flashes out of my gun,\r\nbefore he can get off his shot. I can adjust the speed of his draw\r\nwithin fairly wide limits and I\'ve been moving him up to faster and\r\nfaster speeds. But I\'ve gotten pretty damn fast."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith a drawing motion that was almost a blur, he whipped out his gun\r\nand pulled the trigger. The Marshal was fast, but apparently not _as_\r\nfast for suddenly a recorded voice bellowed in pain and gasped, "you\r\ngot me, you dirty varmint."\r\n\r\n"A little touch of my own," said Amos Handworthy. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
"That\'s what happens\r\nwhen I hit him."\r\n\r\nHe looked down at his gun, almost proudly, and Manny had the eerie\r\nfeeling that it was only with restraint that he did not blow the\r\nimaginary smoke away from the gun barrel.\r\n\r\n"That\'s a highly imaginative device," said Manny.\r\n\r\n"He is," said Amos Handworthy. "But he\'s still not quite what I want\r\nhim to be. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
I have an idea that you can make him the kind of opponent I\r\nneed."\r\n\r\n"What do you want?" said Manny. All of his ennui was beginning to\r\nevaporate and the familiar exultant response to challenge had begun to\r\ngrow in him.\r\n\r\n"I want him to be able to hit me, too, figuratively speaking," said\r\nAmos Handworthy. "As things stand now, this shoot out is entirely one\r\nsided. I\'d like to know, for instance, if he\'s been able to hit me."\r\n\r\n"I can do it," said Manny. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
"You\'ll have to get me off my regular\r\nproject, but I can do it."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll call your division chief in the morning," said Amos Handworthy.\r\n"You\'ll stay here with me and you can have all the time you need."\r\n\r\nManny did not sleep well in his spacious overly comfortable bed. He\r\nwas up early the following morning pouring over the construction plans\r\nfor the Marshal and examining the instruction folder which the Swiss\r\ncompany, with typical thoroughness, had included in the neatly packed\r\nmaintenance kit. He caught the guiding concept of the design at once,\r\nand made his plans to modify the Marshal along lines that incorporated\r\ncontrol techniques that were basically electronic.\r\n\r\nHe phoned the plant and requisitioned transistors, metal film\r\nresistors, capacitors, and various other components necessary for his\r\ntask. Handworthy did not approach him as he worked and his meals were\r\nserved to him either in his own room or the great room where all the\r\nautomata were located. He made all the changes himself, snipping leads,\r\nsoldering, forming tight mechanical joints with deft fingers that\r\nalmost seemed alive and apart from his body.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTen days later, he called in Amos Handworthy and demonstrated what he\r\nhad done.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve modified both guns so that you and the Marshal will now shoot at\r\neach other with ultra violet light. You\'ll both wear vests that are\r\nsensitive to this light. I monitor the hits electrically by measuring\r\nthe resistance of those areas where a bullet would severely injure a\r\nman. Nothing will occur unless you or the Marshal are hit in such an\r\narea. Furthermore, you can both continue to shoot for an indefinite\r\nlength of time. However, I\'ve altered the Marshal\'s aiming mechanism\r\nso that if he\'s hit in a vital spot, he won\'t shoot as accurately.\r\nSimilarly, if you are hit, a defocussing mechanism operates on your\r\nlight bulb so that your gun is no longer as accurate. And instead of\r\nthe recorded voice, if either of you is hit in the heart, your gun goes\r\ndead."\r\n\r\nAmos Handworthy\'s eyes began to glow with a fire such as Manny\r\nSteinberg had never seen and it excited him that his work had brought\r\non so wonderful a response. He slipped the new vest on Handworthy,\r\nhanded him the wired holster and gun, and stepped back. After\r\nfastening his belt and readying himself, Handworthy drew as before and\r\nfired swiftly at the Marshal, who was firing back almost as rapidly.\r\nSuddenly Handworthy stopped and looked at his gun in dismay.\r\n\r\n"My trigger\'s locked," he cried.\r\n\r\n"He\'s killed you," said Manny drily. "You beat him to the draw, but\r\nhe\'s hit you in the heart."\r\n\r\n"I see," said Handworthy slowly. "Then it looks like I\'ve got a hell of\r\na lot more practicing to do."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was a full month before Manny Steinberg was invited back to the\r\nMansion, and with great pride his host demonstrated how he killed the\r\nMarshal, _every time_.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got him set for his fastest draw, too," said Handworthy. "At this\r\npoint, he\'s just no match for me."\r\n\r\n"I guess that wraps it up," said Manny, knowing full well that it\r\ncouldn\'t end this way. "You\'re just too damned good."\r\n\r\nAmos Handworthy shook his head slowly.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t believe that and neither do I. Its an unfair battle, unfair\r\nbecause we\'ve excluded the most vital element of all."\r\n\r\n"What element is that?" said Manny although the answer popped into his\r\nhead even as he spoke and he began to envision the approach that had\r\nto be taken.\r\n\r\n"There\'s no _fear_ in this situation," said Handworthy. "When two men\r\nwere in an actual shootout they were both afraid of being killed. But\r\nthe Marshal is oblivious to fear and so for the most part am I. Suppose\r\nfor instance in some way you could make him shoot better if I were\r\nnervous and shoot less accurately if I were deadly calm."\r\n\r\n"There is a way to do that," said Manny. "I can electrically monitor\r\nyour vasomotor reflexes by means of your pulse and sweat reactions.\r\nThen I would program the Marshal\'s reflexes in just the way you\r\nsuggest. But the thing I can\'t understand is how such a step would\r\nhave any real meaning. Why in God\'s name would you ever be frightened?\r\nThere\'s nothing in this situation to make it happen."\r\n\r\n"I have a very vivid imagination," said Handworthy. "As a child I had\r\nno playmates and still I populated an entire world in my mind, every\r\none a distinct person. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
Don\'t you see, I can project myself into feeling\r\nthat I\'m in the _real_ life and death situation just as long as the\r\nMarshal becomes a creature sensitive to fear."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt took Manny almost three weeks this time to make the requisite\r\nchanges and he carried out in addition an extensive series of pulse\r\nand skin resistance measurements on Handworthy. When he was satisfied\r\nthat the Marshal had reached the ultimate state, he called in\r\nHandworthy and demonstrated what he had done.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve installed," said Manny, "a feedback circuit that\'s inoperative\r\nwhen your typical emotional reaction exists. But the circuit comes\r\ninto play when you become more nervous than usual and the Marshal will\r\ntherefore shoot faster and more accurately. On the other hand, if you\r\nshould become less concerned, calmer perhaps, the Marshal\'s aim would\r\ntend to go askew and his firing rate would slow down. In other words,\r\nyou and the Marshal are indissolubly linked through your nervous system\r\nwhenever you strap on your shooting vest."\r\n\r\n"Fine," said Amos Handworthy and the brilliance of his usually\r\nlackluster eyes gave an added emphasis to the word. "You\'ve surpassed\r\nmy greatest expectations with these new changes. And while I know it\r\nwasn\'t part of our bargain, I intend to add a pretty big sum to your\r\nmonthly check."\r\n\r\n"Thanks," said Manny automatically. Already he was becoming aware of\r\nthe depression that followed his engineering triumphs. As he left the\r\nhouse, he had almost completely lost interest in his accomplishment.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Amos Handworthy was examining the guns with great care,\r\nparticularly the tiny switch that activated the firing cycle. It\r\nwas evident to him that as soon as his gun lifted off the switch,\r\nelectrical activity commenced. After first unplugging the Marshal\'s\r\nelectrical cable, he carefully removed the ultra violet loaded guns\r\nfrom the fixture in his holster and the Marshal\'s holster, and replaced\r\nthem with beautifully machined Colt .45\'s that were loaded with real\r\nbullets.\r\n\r\n"There\'s absolutely no doubt that the mechanical action will be the\r\nsame," thought Handworthy, "and now the element of real fear, both\r\n_mine_ and _his_ will be in the picture. We\'re going to have a real\r\nshootout, the kind you don\'t see any more."\r\n\r\nHe replaced the plug in the wall socket and turned about to face the\r\nMarshal quite squarely, shifting his belt around so that his gun would\r\nclear free of the holster. The Marshal stared at him out of sightless\r\npainted blue eyes, his mechanical hand resting stolidly on his gun.\r\n\r\n"Even now, it isn\'t an even match," thought Handworthy ruefully. "I\r\ncouldn\'t be any calmer than I am now. I guess it never can come out\r\njust exactly as I want it to."\r\n\r\nAs his fingers flashed lightning fast to his gun, it suddenly occurred\r\nto him that Manny was right, that he and the Marshal were indissolubly\r\nlinked through his own nervous system. He had no kin, no wife, no\r\nchildren. The Marshal was the only one on earth really tied to him. And\r\nin that instant, a terrible surge of fear came over him at the thought\r\nof killing his own.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
