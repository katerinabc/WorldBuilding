The noise and the abrupt handling of his body brought him to\r\nawareness.\r\n\r\nNot that he had been asleep or unconscious. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
Although he might have\r\nbeen. He didn\'t know for sure.\r\n\r\nHe found it hard to concentrate, but soon a sign over the platform came\r\ninto focus:\r\n\r\n                               WESTBORO\r\n\r\nIt meant nothing to him. The second thing he became aware of did.\r\n\r\nAnother train had replaced his, and directly in front of him was\r\nan army of people, dispassionate towards everything but its one\r\nobjective--to get on.\r\n\r\nThey came at him all at once, forming a pushing, elbowing, cursing,\r\njarring mass of humanity. He glanced off one to collide with another.\r\nHe escaped the punishment by a lunge to one side which ended with a\r\ncrash to the cold cement floor.\r\n\r\nHe regained some semblance of steadiness on his feet and looked at the\r\nsign. It was still Westboro. It still meant nothing to him.\r\n\r\nHe was lost.\r\n\r\nWhat was worse, he couldn\'t remember where he was lost _from_.\r\n\r\nHe turned to walk, he didn\'t know exactly where, when he smashed into a\r\nlittle boy eating an apple.\r\n\r\nThe boy reacted in a strange manner.\r\n\r\n"Leave me alone, you dirty man, you," the boy said. He dropped his\r\napple and ran off. Scared.\r\n\r\nThe man flushed with embarrassment, but the boy\'s remark made him look\r\ndown at himself.\r\n\r\nHe saw a dirty man. Filthy. His white shirt--it had been white\r\nonce--was torn at the elbow and was covered with grime, his shoes at\r\nthe toes were white where the black polish had worn completely off, his\r\npants reflected no evidence of ever having been pressed and the right\r\nleg was ripped from the knee down.\r\n\r\nTwo girls in their teens passed and giggled.\r\n\r\nHe was aware that others had noticed him.\r\n\r\n"Hey, lookit the bum," a fat jolly-rover called out to his three\r\non-the-towning cronies.\r\n\r\n"Bum," the man thought, and reached to his back pocket.\r\n\r\nNo wallet. But not long ago he had one, he was sure, because the feel\r\nof its absence was there. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Somebody must have taken it, or he might\r\nhave lost it. In that crowd or on the subway or before.... He couldn\'t\r\nremember where he had been before.\r\n\r\nThe feeling of not remembering seemed familiar, and he tried hard to\r\nthink. But there was nothing static in his mind that he could hold on\r\nto. His mind wasn\'t blank anymore, it was a jumble. He somehow recalled\r\nhe had been looking for his money. He fumbled through his other pockets.\r\n\r\nHe found a dirty handkerchief and two cents.\r\n\r\nThe feel of the coins brought everything back.\r\n\r\nQuickly he felt his pulse. It was slower than he had ever known it to\r\nbe. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Sure, there were times before when ... but then the doctor always\r\nhad been nearby. And this time, the most serious time of all--he looked\r\nup at the Westboro sign--he was lost. Perhaps, up on the streets, he\r\nwould recognize something.\r\n\r\nHe began to take the stairs at a run, but his breath came too hard, and\r\nhe walked the rest of the way to the turnstile. The arm caught tight as\r\nhe started to go through and a sharp pain want through his groin.\r\n\r\n"That\'s the way you go _in_, pal," somebody offered, and the man winced\r\nat the few laughs he had drawn. He saw the exit sign and walked quickly\r\ntoward it.\r\n\r\nThe night lights were just ahead as he collided with a woman loaded\r\nwith bundles. They spilled. "Sorry," he said, leaving her to her\r\nindignation, and at a faster pace he walked outside into the cool night\r\nair.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe had stopped walking and was leaning against the door of the Inn of\r\nSix Horses, which proudly displayed its name and namesakes in blue and\r\nwhite neon.\r\n\r\nHe had recognized nothing.\r\n\r\nHe had tried getting to the doctor\'s by cab, but no driver would listen\r\nto him without first seeing the fare, even though he assured them all\r\nthat he could get it from the doctor.\r\n\r\nA policeman had told him to move along or suffer the consequences of a\r\nthick nightstick.\r\n\r\nA drugstore proprietor had answered his request to use the phone by\r\nthreatening to call the policeman with the thick nightstick.\r\n\r\nA dime. One dime!\r\n\r\nHe remembered his Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nMy kingdom for a ... horse? Six horses. Maybe, just maybe, at the Inn\r\nof Six Horses....\r\n\r\nA short man at the bar, composing one half of the clientele, was\r\ncalling the bartender\'s attention to the fact that the six horses\r\noutside outnumbered the customers.\r\n\r\n"Go to blazes," the bartender commented on the short man\'s observation.\r\n\r\n"I should," said the short one. "Then George here would be Uncas, the\r\nlast of the Mohicans, riding your six old white stallions."\r\n\r\n"How do you know they\'re stallions?"

George said. He was lean, mean and\r\nweary, looking as if he had just returned from a hard day of peddling\r\nvacuum cleaners.\r\n\r\nThe door banged shut and three pairs of eyes focused on a dirty man.\r\n\r\n"Here comes a touch," said Pete.\r\n\r\n"Please," said the man, his voice shaky and weak.\r\n\r\n"Before you go into your act, pal," Pete said, "understand this: Nobody\r\ngets nothing free here, this ain\'t no mission or nothing. This is a\r\nbusiness like any place else."\r\n\r\n"A real thriving business," mocked Shorty.\r\n\r\n"Please, a dime, I need a dime, that\'s all I--"\r\n\r\n"A _dime_?" George laughed. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
"For what, a cup of coffee? This is a\r\nhigh-class place. Beer costs fifteen cents here."\r\n\r\nShorty joined in with a snort. "Maybe he wants to call his girl."\r\n\r\n"I _need_ the dime," the man said, leaning on the bar for support.\r\n\r\n"A matter of real life and death, huh?" George said.\r\n\r\n"Yes. Look ... here, I have two cents, you take them."\r\n\r\nPete looked suspiciously at the two coins. "We don\'t sell nothing that\r\ncosts two cents."\r\n\r\n"You take the two cents, but give me a dime. _Please._"\r\n\r\n"Sharp businessman," noted George.\r\n\r\n"This is rich," said Pete. "Do you really expect to _buy_ a dime for\r\ntwo cents?"\r\n\r\nShorty said, "He just noticed how well you\'re doing. He figures you can\r\nafford the loss."\r\n\r\n"Boy, it burns me up," said Pete. "These professional bums make more in\r\na week than I see in a month."\r\n\r\n"You keep talking that way, and this clown will want to buy your\r\nbusiness for the two cents," Shorty said. "Ain\'t worth it," George said\r\nand banged his glass down. "Fill it," he directed Pete.\r\n\r\nAs Pete turned, the man made a lunge for George\'s change on the bar.\r\n\r\n"Watch him," warned Shorty.\r\n\r\nGeorge needed no warning. He had seen the man eying his money, and he\r\nhad hoped for just such a move. With a right fist to the side of the\r\nman\'s head, George took revenge for a bad day\'s work.\r\n\r\nThe man lay very still on the floor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"What a paste," said Shorty, admiringly. "You could have killed him\r\nlike that."\r\n\r\n"He sure ain\'t doing much moving," said Pete, coming around the end of\r\nthe bar. "I\'d better take a look."\r\n\r\n"Man, I didn\'t hit him that hard."\r\n\r\n"Well, _man_, he sure asked for it," said Shorty. "And me and Pete will\r\nbe right here to tell the cops that the guy was a crook and tried to\r\nrob your money. Right, Pete?"\r\n\r\n"George, this guy\'s got no pulse," Pete said.\r\n\r\n"Watcha gonna do, George?" Shorty said.\r\n\r\n"Just shut up and wait a minute," Pete said. "I think he\'s trying to\r\nsay something."\r\n\r\nThe man\'s eyes pleaded with each of the three. His lips quietly formed\r\ntheir message:\r\n\r\n"Dime."\r\n\r\n"Wow, talk about persistence," said Shorty.\r\n\r\nGeorge looked at his change on the bar.\r\n\r\nHe picked up a dime.\r\n\r\n"Hey," said Shorty, "what are you doing?"\r\n\r\n"Shut up," said Pete. "George\'s money is George\'s money. What he does\r\nwith it is his business."\r\n\r\n"Look," George said, "I didn\'t mean to hit you so hard. I mean, I hit\r\nyou so hard my whole hand hurts. So here, you can have the dime, I\r\nwon\'t miss it."\r\n\r\nHe pressed the dime into the man\'s hand.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Holy cow," said Shorty. It was the first sound any of the three had\r\nmade after the man had left, fifteen minutes before.\r\n\r\nGeorge stared into the mirror behind the bar, seeking some mighty truth\r\nin his own reflection. "He says ... he says _Unbutton my shirt_, and\r\nthen...."\r\n\r\nGeorge fondled some coins in his hand. "Then he takes that crazy dime,\r\na plain old, regular, crazy dime...."\r\n\r\nPete poured himself a Scotch. "What kind of guy is it, anyway," he\r\nsaid, "who walks around with a slot in the middle of his chest that he\r\nputs dimes into?"\r\n\r\n"Yeah," said George, "and who _ticks_, yet?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
