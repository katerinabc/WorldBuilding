L. CAMPBELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nYes; I mean what I say\xe2\x80\x94an automatic maid-of-all-work, invented by my\r\nhusband, John Matheson.\r\n\r\nYou see it was this way,\xe2\x80\x94the old story of servants, ever since we began\r\nhousekeeping. We\xe2\x80\x99ve had every kind, and if we did get a good one,\r\nsomething would come along to take her off.\r\n\r\nYou know John has invented lots of things. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
There\xe2\x80\x99s that door-spring\r\nnow,\xe2\x80\x94not much when you look at it but it brings in quite a little income.\r\nHe used to say that he was spending his spare time on an automatic\r\nmaid-of-all-work. Of course, I laughed, said I wished he would, and\r\nthought no more of it.\r\n\r\nWell, the day the last girl left, John announced that the automatic\r\nmaid-of-all-work was completed, and that he would stay at home next day\r\nand show me how to work it.\r\n\r\nOf course, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe in it.\r\n\r\nIt was a queer-looking thing, with its long arms, for all the world like\r\none of those old-fashioned wind-mills you see in pictures of foreign\r\ncountries. It had a face like one of those twenty-four hour clocks, only\r\nthere were no hands; each number was a sort of electric button. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
It was\r\nrun by electricity, you know. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
The battery was inside. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand\r\nit very well; I never could see into anything in the way of machinery;\r\nI never pretend to listen when John tells me about his inventions. The\r\nfigures, as I said, were buttons, and you just had to connect them with\r\nsome wires inside. There were a lot of wires, each for some kind of work\r\nwhich would be done at the hour indicated by the button you connected it\r\nwith. This was handy, so that we would not have to get up in the morning\r\ntill breakfast-time, and would be handy in lots of ways.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow look, Fanny,\xe2\x80\x9d said John; \xe2\x80\x9cdo try and understand how it works.\r\nYou see this wire now; I\xe2\x80\x99ll connect it with button number six, and at\r\nthat hour the maid will light the fire, sweep the kitchen and then the\r\ndining-room. Now this button number seven will be the one to set the\r\nalarm to. It will sound for about ten minutes (I\xe2\x80\x99d sound it now only it\r\nmakes a fearful noise); then the maid will go upstairs to turn down the\r\nbeds\xe2\x80\x94a convenient arrangement in many ways. Then it will go downstairs,\r\nlay the cloth for breakfast, make the tea and toast, bring in the things,\r\nand ring the breakfast bell. You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to leave all the breakfast\r\nthings on one shelf, of course, and measure the oatmeal and tea also. We\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t set any more buttons to-night. It\xe2\x80\x99s just as well to be around at\r\nfirst to see that all goes right. There may be some adjustment necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe went to bed then, and it was daylight when I awoke. I was conscious\r\nof a peculiar whirring noise, but I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t got thoroughly awakened when\r\nI heard the most awful screams and thumps, and the two boys came running\r\ninto our room in their night-dresses, and after them the automatic\r\nmaid-of-all-work.\r\n\r\nBy this time I was out of bed, but John sleeps very soundly. He\r\nstarted as the maid jerked the bed-clothes down and laid them over the\r\nfoot-board, but he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t quick enough. It took him under the arm. It\r\nhad an awful grip, too,\xe2\x80\x94and laid him across the foot-board, after giving\r\nhim a thump or two, as I do the pillows. (John had watched me do it and\r\nhad the thing to perfection. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t suppose it would be tried on him,\r\nthough). He didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem quite prepared for such a performance, for he\r\nflounced around so that he and the bed-clothes, pillows and all, landed\r\nin a heap on the floor.\r\n\r\nBy this time the boys had got over their fright, having been treated in\r\nthe same manner, and we all laughed. John can\xe2\x80\x99t bear to be laughed at.\r\nHowever, we proceeded to dress after the maid had gone downstairs. I\r\ncould see John was a little nervous, but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to show it, so he\r\nwaited till I was ready. The boys got down first, and we could hear them\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to arrange the table a little, Fanny,\xe2\x80\x9d said John,\r\nas we went down, \xe2\x80\x9cbut that won\xe2\x80\x99t be much to do when all the things are\r\non.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, we went into the dining-room, and sure enough the table was set,\r\nand pretty well too, only that the butter dish, with the butter, was\r\nupside down on the table, and the coal-scuttle was set at John\xe2\x80\x99s place,\r\ninstead of the oatmeal dish. That was because John, who always leaves\r\nthings in ridiculous places, had left it standing on the back of the\r\nstove after putting in the coal ready for the morning fire. The porridge\r\nwas standing cooked on the stove. We had got an arrangement with a white\r\nearthen bowl set into a kettle, and the bowl had just to be removed and\r\ncarried in. However, the coal scuttle had stood in the way, and John\r\nhad to carry it out and bring in the porridge. The toast was scorched a\r\nlittle, but the eggs were boiled just to perfection, and we enjoyed it\r\nall immensely.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the maid was upstairs making the beds, and such beds you never\r\nsaw. You\xe2\x80\x99d think they\xe2\x80\x99d been cast in a mould. The maid came downstairs\r\njust as we were through, and then John pulled another wire. After doing\r\nso he acted rather strangely. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
He didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be able to let go the\r\nwire for a minute. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
It gave him a shock, you know. After that he handled\r\nthe wires more carefully.\r\n\r\nThen the maid proceeded to clear the table. Here was a slight\r\ncomplication, however, for the maid washed everything, and though we had\r\neaten up nearly all, still there was some butter in the dish, a bowl of\r\nsugar, and the salt-cellar. However, as there was lots of good hot water,\r\nthe dishes after they were wiped were as clean as could be; but John\r\nsuggested that for the present, until he could make some improvements,\r\nthe eatables had better be removed first, for \xe2\x80\x9cof course,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthere will be some imperfections.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Fanny, I suppose you want to wash, don\xe2\x80\x99t you? You have the clothes\r\nready, I see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but it seems to me the dining-room is not swept very clean. Anyway\r\nthe crumbs ought to be swept up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly,\xe2\x80\x9d returned John, \xe2\x80\x9conly, you see, I fixed it so that it would\r\njust run around the table once before breakfast, then afterwards you can\r\nhave all the furniture moved out and the whole room swept every day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, the maid proceeded to remove the furniture. It went to the middle\r\nof the room, then began to circle around, removing everything it came\r\nin contact with, and setting things out in the hall. John dropped the\r\nleaves of the table, and all went well till it came to the stove and\r\nattempted to remove that also; but something was amiss, and it veered\r\noff to one side. John started forward to turn it off that track, but it\r\npromptly picked him up and removed him. I forgot to say that a revolving\r\nbrush in the bottom was sweeping all this time, and now the thing was\r\nmaking the last circuit as I thought, for it had touched the wall on\r\nthree sides, and I was wondering how it would get into the corners,\r\nwhile John watched the stove, and wondered if it could pass between that\r\nand the wall without coming in contact with the stove. But there the\r\npassage was not wide enough, and the stove, a little open grate, was\r\npicked up and removed. The pipes fell down and made a lot of dirt, but\r\nthat was pretty well swept up, as the maid had to make two or three more\r\ncircles to allow for the corners. John replaced the furniture, as he had\r\nnot provided for that part of the work. The stove we decided to carry\r\nout for the season, but in the meantime he had started the maid at the\r\nwashing. You see there was no time lost between things; and I tell you\r\nthose clothes were washed, and so was John\xe2\x80\x99s coat, which being a pretty\r\ngood one he had taken off and laid on the bench. Then we had the kitchen\r\nscrubbed, the same apparatus which did the sweeping doing that also. John\r\nadjusted it so that the furniture was merely pushed aside. The worst of\r\nthe thing was that you could not stop the maid, when it got going, till\r\nit had run down, and what was more, if you interfered with the wires when\r\nit was going, you were apt to get a shock from the battery. This was\r\ninconvenient sometimes; for instance, after the kitchen was all scrubbed,\r\nthe thing still ran around the walls scrubbing as hard as ever. John said\r\nthe only thing was to pull another wire and set it to work at something\r\nelse; it would run till after the tea dishes were washed, anyway, and\r\nprobably we could find something harmless to keep it employed. Just then\r\nJohn was called out to speak to a man about some coal, and I undertook\r\nto head the thing across the middle of the room. Unfortunately it rushed\r\nstraight into the dining-room, water-pail and all. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t care much.\r\nI wanted a new carpet for that room, anyway, and I knew that sooty spot\r\nwould never come out. The water in the pail was very dirty by this time.\r\nJohn had not thought of its having to be changed.\r\n\r\nPresently John returned, and we got into the kitchen again. There was\r\nanother funny thing about it. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Whenever anyone got going ahead of it in\r\nthe same direction it was sure to follow, and the only way to get out\r\nof its road was to double back on your own track and dodge it. It was\r\nthe current of air it followed. John said he had a reason for making it\r\nthat way. While sweeping the kitchen it got after one of the boys once,\r\nand it dodged around tables and chairs just as he did, till John told\r\nhim to turn and go back. It got after Bruno when we got it out of the\r\ndining-room into the kitchen. He had just come in from the barn to get\r\nsomething to eat. He turned tail and howled, but he could not get out of\r\nthe way till he jumped out of the window. The cat fared worse than Bruno\r\nthough, for she was picked up along with the wiping cloth and rubbed over\r\nthe floor for about three yards before she managed to get free. There was\r\nquite a hole in the window, and we have not seen the cat since.\r\n\r\nJohn said there was a fine arrangement for answering the door. Of\r\ncourse, in some instances, we would have to go ourselves, especially\r\nif any old lady or timid person, who had not made the acquaintance of\r\nthe maid, were expected, but if the postman or parcel delivery it would\r\nbe all right. Anyone could send in a card, too, you see. But the best\r\nof all was the arrangement for putting tramps off the premises. John\r\nwas just explaining how this was done when Fred exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s an\r\nold fellow now; I wonder if he is coming here!\xe2\x80\x9d Yes, sure enough; he\r\nturned in at the gate, and presently there was a ring at the door-bell.\r\nBeggars are so impudent, and this was an old offender, so I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say\r\nanything when John pressed the wire, and we all followed to the door to\r\nsee the effect, John remarking that it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt him. The door was\r\nopened quite quietly, but closed with a bang after the maid. At first,\r\nupon re-opening the door, we thought it had missed fire, for the tramp,\r\nlooking somewhat scared, stood at one side of the doorway, but the maid\r\nwas scuttling down the path with some limp figure in its arms. I was\r\nsorry to recognize an uncle of John\xe2\x80\x99s, from whom John had expectations.\r\nI knew his bald head. The maid had him by the middle, and his feet and\r\nhead hung down, so that his hat dropped off. He was too much surprised to\r\nattempt resistance, and the maid deposited him in a heap in the gutter,\r\nand then returned. We were so bothered by the turn affairs had taken\r\nthat we forgot to get out of the way. Fred received a slap which sent\r\nhim sprawling. John was lifted bodily, after the manner of his uncle,\r\nand laid upon the table, while I, my skirts being caught, was forced\r\nto run backwards in a very undignified manner, till, by grasping a\r\ndoor-knob, I wrenched myself free at the expense of a width of my skirt.\r\nI stood hanging on to that door-knob as if I expected momentarily to be\r\nsnatched up and thrown out of the window, when my eyes happened to fall\r\nupon Tommy. He was lying upon his back on the floor, his legs slowly\r\nwaving in the air. He made not a sound. The expression on his face gave\r\nme such a start that I relaxed my hold on the door-knob, thinking that\r\nhe was injured internally. But he raised his hand, and feebly waved me\r\naside. He was simply too tired to laugh any more, and was obliged to\r\nlie down and wave his legs to express his feelings. Fred had begun to\r\nwhimper after picking himself up, but, catching sight of Tommy, laughed\r\ninstead, until something in their father\xe2\x80\x99s eye caused both of the boys to\r\ntake themselves out of doors. However, they perched upon the fence just\r\noutside of a window and looked in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, Fanny, we must expect some complications at first,\xe2\x80\x9d said John,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut after awhile we\xe2\x80\x99ll get used to running it better.\xe2\x80\x9d This he said\r\nas the maid started out of the front door again, after having buzzed\r\naround the hall for a minute; for, as I told you, it was necessary to\r\nstart it at some new work in order to stop what it was doing, and, in\r\nthe meantime, while we were recovering our breath, it was making trips\r\nthrough the hall to the front gate, and hence to the gutter and back\r\nagain. John was explaining that we could arrange the length of the trip\r\nas we pleased, and it need ordinarily be only to the front door. Just\r\nthen, however, we heard most awful screams, and we rushed to the door to\r\nsee what was the matter. It seems that the maid had encountered at the\r\ngate the form of a stout, elderly female, with a basket and an umbrella,\r\nand of course had proceeded to remove the obstacle. However, the obstacle\r\nrefused to be removed, and they were having a lively time of it. A crowd\r\nwas beginning to collect, and a policeman appeared around the corner. He\r\ninterfered in behalf of the stout female, and attempted to arrest the\r\nmaid. The maid, however, made short work of him. It did not succeed,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s true, in depositing him in the ditch, but it spoiled his hat, and\r\ncaused him to beat a hasty retreat; then, having removed all obstacles,\r\ntraversed the remainder of the limit and returned to the house, followed\r\nby another angry policeman, who, after considerable persuasion, was\r\ninduced to depart.\r\n\r\nAfter the door closed upon the policeman, John looked at me and I at him.\r\nThe maid had accomplished several revolutions around the dining-room and\r\nwas about to return. \xe2\x80\x9cMercy, Fanny, you\xe2\x80\x99re always talking how much there\r\nis to do; can\xe2\x80\x99t you think of something I\xe2\x80\x99m not supposed to know.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nanswered, grimly, but an idea struck John, and he immediately hurried to\r\npull another wire. He did not accomplish it with impunity, however, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to say he made use of some expressions, as he danced around for\r\na minute, which I was glad the boys didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear.\r\n\r\nThe maid now went out to the woodshed, and John fixed the handle of the\r\naxe into the attachment at the end of one of the arms. Here was something\r\nout of the ordinary way, and John brightened up considerably as the axe\r\nbegan to move up and down with a regular, double motion, reached forward,\r\nstruck a stick at random with the axe blade so as to catch the stick,\r\ndrew it forward into position and struck it, splitting it in the centre,\r\nand threw the pieces with two other arms into the corner, and so on till\r\nthe pile began to get low. Any sticks that were not split fine enough,\r\nJohn threw back.\r\n\r\nAll proceeded well enough till the last stick was split. Then the maid\r\nstarted to buzz around in search of more. It attacked the saw horse and\r\ndemolished it, ran into a tub and reduced it to kindling wood, ripped\r\nup a barrel of ashes and raised a terrible dust which completely drove\r\nJohn into the house. All this time he was trying to get near enough to\r\nstart it off on another track, but it wheeled around and flung the axe so\r\nmenacingly that John got excited and lost his head.\r\n\r\nWhen the dust had subsided sufficiently we went out again. By this time\r\nthe maid had anchored beside the new wood pile and was splitting it over.\r\nThis would not have mattered much; we didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind the wood being reduced\r\nto matches, but it was close to the shed window and the sticks were being\r\nflung through, carrying broken glass with them into the street. John did\r\nnot care for another visit from the policeman, but he was completely\r\nnonplussed. Just then he heard a stifled chuckle and looking over his\r\nshoulder he saw several boys perched on the fence and among them our own,\r\nwho immediately dropped down. But what maddened John was the sight of\r\na newspaper reporter also, who was evidently sketching the scene. Then\r\nthe air began to be filled with flying missiles which John threw at the\r\nmaid, till, by some lucky hit, some of the machinery was jarred and the\r\nmaid rushed wildly around the shed, the axe now slashing about with\r\na motion evidently intended for some other office than wood chopping.\r\nJohn ran to shut the door in the face of the reporter who was filling\r\nsheets with sketches. The maid, however, started after him. John stopped,\r\ntried to dodge, hesitated, then ran out of the back gate and down the\r\nroad, the maid thrashing at him with the axe. This was serious. I ran to\r\nthe gate and anxiously looked after them, while the boys and reporter\r\nfollowed in the wake of the maid. I very much feared the maid would run\r\ninto something and do some damage, but I soon saw that, as, of course,\r\nJohn avoided all obstacles so did the maid and simply followed him. I\r\nwondered why he did not reverse and pass the maid, thus putting it off\r\nthe track. Presently, however, John returned alone and looking somewhat\r\ntravel-stained. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
He pushed past me and went upstairs to the bathroom. I\r\ndid not dare to follow to ask questions, but Fred and Tommy also returned\r\nsoon and told me what happened after I lost sight of them.\r\n\r\nIt seems that, first of all, the axe flew off the handle and chopped a\r\nrooster, which was scurrying out of the way, almost in two. Then they\r\ncaught up with a cow. It was quite a bit out of town, and she started to\r\nrun in the same direction. John swerved to one side and the maid caught\r\nup with the cow and belabored her with the axe handle. This maddened the\r\ncow so that she made for the river and rushed in, the maid after her.\r\nThey slashed about in the stream for a minute: then the maid sank and\r\nthe cow appeared on the other side.\r\n\r\nNext morning, about an hour after John went down town, he sent up a new\r\ncarpet for the dining-room. We have a German girl now, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nbut that she\xe2\x80\x99s better than the automatic maid-of-all-work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Automatic Maid-of-All-Work, by M.
