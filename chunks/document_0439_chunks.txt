The thick silence was broken as the\r\njudge said solemnly: "Your objection will be taken under advisement\r\nby the court, Counselor. In what manner will the childhood of the\r\ndefendant be relevant to this case, Mr. Prosecutor?"\r\n\r\n"It is my purpose to show, your Honor, that the defendant has been of\r\nunsound mind since birth, and therefore has long been a public menace,\r\nnot merely a victim of circumstance as the defense would have us\r\nbelieve." The prosecuting attorney nodded briefly in the direction of\r\nthe table for the defense.\r\n\r\n"Objection overruled," the judge said. "You may call your witness."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, your Honor." The prosecutor helped the flighty woman into\r\nthe witness box.\r\n\r\n"Will you please give the court your name?"\r\n\r\nThe woman simpered. "Ida Mae Holk. Mrs. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Ida Mae Holk."\r\n\r\nThe prosecutor cleared his throat and ruffled the papers in his hand.\r\n\r\n"How long have you known the defendant, Mrs. Holk?

=== Chunk 4 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Why, ever since he was about two years old. Him and his Ma came to\r\nElmwood right after his Pa was killed in that big Oak Ridge explosion.\r\nHe was born right there on the government project, you know. Never\r\ncould understand why Mrs. Sloan, that was his Ma, never did get married\r\nagain, her being so pretty and all, and any number of nice widowers\r\njust--"\r\n\r\n"Uh, yes, Mrs. Holk," the prosecutor interrupted. "Was your\r\nacquaintance with the defendant continuous throughout his childhood?"\r\n\r\n"Well, it was until he was ten years old. They sent him away to that\r\ncrazy house then."\r\n\r\n"I object to the term \'crazy house\', your Honor," the public defender\r\naddressed the court.\r\n\r\n"I am sure that the witness meant to say the Rochelle School for\r\nRetarded Children," the prosecutor said mildly. "Didn\'t you, Mrs. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Holk?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I guess that is what they call it," she said grudgingly.\r\n"Anyway, they kept him there until he was eighteen. Then he came back\r\nto Elmwood and I\'ve known him ever since."\r\n\r\n"As a child, was the defendant er, ah, strange; that is, different from\r\nthe other children?"\r\n\r\n"He certainly was." The woman drew herself up primly. "Why, the first\r\ntime that I ever laid eyes on that boy I said to my neighbor \'did you\r\never see a child with such a big head and such brooding eyes\', why--"\r\n\r\nThe public defender started to rise.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mean physical characteristics, Mrs. Holk," the prosecutor\r\nhurriedly interjected. "The court is interested only in facts that will\r\nprove relevant to the case at hand."\r\n\r\n"Oh." Mrs. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Holk seemed disappointed. "Well, he never played much with\r\nthe other children because they made so much fun of him. Not that\r\nthey didn\'t have a right to, the way he was always acting. Picking up\r\nstray dogs and cats, and every thing else under the sun, and telling\r\neverybody that would listen how he cured their sores. It was enough to\r\nmake a person sick. He even claimed that he could cure himself, and\r\nthat was the reason that he was never sick! Hmmfp.\r\n\r\n"Of course, he wasn\'t ever sick. No sir, not a day in his life. Never\r\nhad the measles or the mumps like my Sally, and even when that terrible\r\nflu epidemic hit town he was just as chipper as you please. If you want\r\nincidents, I can tell you a dozen. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
There was one time when he was\r\nabout five and I was over visiting with his ma. He came running into\r\nthe house telling some big story about a bird with a busted wing that\r\nhe had fixed up. Of course, his ma shut him up; she always was too easy\r\non him. Another time--"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The man with the too big head and the serene features gazed softly at\r\nthe witness stand. He remembered about the bird. He had been very young\r\nat the time and hadn\'t known, yet, that everyone didn\'t have The Gift._\r\n\r\n_He had found the little bird at the base of the old oak tree, scared\r\nand trembling from the dangers that threatened it out of its known\r\nelement. He picked it up gently and felt the fluttering of its tiny\r\nheart in the palm of his hand. He saw that its wing was injured,\r\nand, with a feeling of pity and kindness, he located and repaired\r\nthe injury. The little bird lay quietly in his hand, as if sensing a\r\nfriend. Then it flew away into the blue sky._\r\n\r\n_He ran into the house to tell his mother about the bird that he had\r\nfound helpless in the yard and how he had made it well so that it could\r\nfly again._\r\n\r\n_"Yes darling," his mother smiled tolerantly. "I\'m sure you were a good\r\nboy.

=== Chunk 8 ===
"_\r\n\r\n_He could see that she had a headache. He could see the pulse and flow\r\nof the waves of pain and he wondered why she didn\'t fix it. He was\r\nnever sick. It was so easy to be well...._\r\n\r\n_With the directness of the very young he asked her, "Mother, why don\'t\r\nyou make your headache go away?"_\r\n\r\n_His mother dropped to her knees in front of him._\r\n\r\n_"Why you sweet boy," she said. "Always thinking of your mother. Here,\r\nkiss my head and the ache will go away."_\r\n\r\n_Gravely he looked at her. Grownups were a funny lot. He didn\'t have to\r\nkiss her head to make the headache go away; but she was his mother and\r\nhe loved her. If she wanted to pretend, why, then he would also. So he\r\nkissed her head and caused the ache and pain to recede and disappear.\r\nLaughing, his mother got to her feet, took two aspirin tablets, and\r\nshooed him out to play. Strange, that he couldn\'t remember Mrs. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
Holk\r\nbeing there...._\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Mrs. Holk," the prosecutor said. "That will be all for now\r\nunless the defense wishes to cross examine."\r\n\r\n"No questions." The public defender leaned toward his client. "Are you\r\nsure that you won\'t testify in your own behalf?"\r\n\r\nThe man smiled and shook his head.\r\n\r\n"May I call the next witness, your Honor?"\r\n\r\n"Will you tell the court your name and position, please?"\r\n\r\n"My name is Sylvia Johnson, and I am floor superintendent at the\r\nRochelle School."\r\n\r\n"Were you superintendent during the eight years that Carl Sloan was in\r\ncommitment at that institution?"\r\n\r\n"I was."\r\n\r\n"Will you tell the court any pertinent facts concerning his behavior up\r\nto the time of his discharge?"\r\n\r\nShe smoothed the hem of her dress and looked thoughtful for a moment.\r\n\r\n"At first Carl seemed to be the oddest of all of the children in the\r\nschool. He seemed to think that he had some kind of miraculous healing\r\npowers and couldn\'t, or wouldn\'t, understand why the rest of us weren\'t\r\nsimilarly blessed."\r\n\r\nShe waited for the small titter to subside and then continued.\r\n\r\n"However our rather necessarily stern measures soon cured him of his\r\ndelusions, or, at least, so we thought at the time. After that, he\r\ndidn\'t seem to be very much different from the others. A little more\r\nsullen, perhaps, and not quite as quick to learn the duties expected of\r\nhim as some of the less handicapped children; but then, _we_ can\'t work\r\nmiracles at the school."\r\n\r\nShe paused and those nearest the quiet defendant turned and stared at\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_He didn\'t even notice for he was once again ten years old and standing\r\noutside his cousin\'s bedroom window. He wasn\'t supposed to be there\r\nbecause Billy was sick with an odd virus and had been quarantined until\r\nthe doctors had decided what ailed him._\r\n\r\n_"No," Billy said, in answer to his question. "Don\'t be silly. If I\r\ncould get rid of this awful cough I would, wouldn\'t I?"_\r\n\r\n_"I can," Carl replied, his youthful voice confident._\r\n\r\n_Of course Billy didn\'t believe him but Carl saw what was to be done\r\nand did it. Billy\'s dad, disturbed by the excited conversation, came\r\nand told Carl to go on home where he belonged; but Carl forgot his\r\nscooter and had to go back after it. He could hear Billy\'s parents\r\ntalking in the living room._\r\n\r\n_"Carl is a very strange boy," said Billy\'s mother._\r\n\r\n_"If you ask me, he\'s half crazy. All of this wild talk about doctoring\r\ncats, and that dead frog that he said he brought back to life."_\r\n\r\n(_This was not quite true, Carl knew. The frog had not been dead, only\r\nsick. He had proudly told his uncle of the incident only a day or two\r\nbefore._)\r\n\r\n_"I think that we should have a little talk with Jane. Surely, she can\r\nsee that he is not normal. He should be in that school for abnormal\r\nchildren over in the valley," Billy\'s father said emphatically._\r\n\r\n_The next day his aunt and uncle had talked to his mother and Carl\r\nlistened at the window. He knew that he wasn\'t supposed to eavesdrop\r\nbut he was puzzled, and scared. At first, his mother answered the\r\nproposal with a flat "no", but his uncle\'s persuasions won out in the\r\nend. Tearfully, she finally agreed that a year or two in the school\r\nmight be of some help in correcting his too obvious imagination. The\r\nnews spread rapidly and the tongue-waggers worked overtime._\r\n\r\n_"Did you hear about the Sloan boy?" one would ask._\r\n\r\n_"Oh, yes," another would answer. "Crazy as a loon, quite."_\r\n\r\n_"I always knew that there was something wrong with that boy, him never\r\ngetting sick and all that. His head always was too big for the rest of\r\nhim. I knew all along that he was crazy, all right."_\r\n\r\n_"They\'re going to ship him off to school, I understand. Well, good\r\nriddance I say. Wouldn\'t want my Henry associating with a goofy kid."_\r\n\r\n_He didn\'t like to recall the school. It was dim and foreboding and\r\nthe beds always seemed to be cold and dank. He learned quickly that\r\nnone of the institutional authorities were interested in his Gift and\r\nafter the first several rebuffs and their consequential punishments,\r\nhe never again talked about it to anyone. He was, by force, a recluse;\r\nbut he learned the lessons that they thought that he should learn, and,\r\nif they were much more simple than his intellect warranted, he didn\'t\r\nblame the teachers._\r\n\r\nAs if he could feel the stares of the curious people, Carl raised his\r\nhead. The prosecutor was still examining the superintendent.\r\n\r\n"Then he was released as fit to be assimilated by society when he was\r\neighteen?"\r\n\r\nThe witness leaned forward in the box.\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said intently. "The exact disposition of his case history\r\nwas \'Simple minded, but perfectly harmless\'."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Simple minded? Yes, if shyness and averseness to people constitute\r\nsimple mindedness. He did odd jobs for the townspeople and they\r\ntolerated him. Gardening, fetching and carrying, sweeping out the\r\nlibrary. He read. Avidly he read everything that he could find. He\r\nlearned about Mendel and his peas, and he knew what he was. An ugly\r\nword, a Mutant. It made him different and gave him a Gift that no one\r\nbelieved that he had, or wanted him to exercise._\r\n\r\n_That crazy Sloan, or that half wit Sloan, the townspeople called him,\r\nbut he didn\'t care. He had never had any friends or companions and\r\ntherefore felt no need for any. The small animals were his friends, and\r\nthe children. He was never too busy to make a kite, or mend a toy or a\r\nskinned knee. He never mentioned his Gift but silently, unnoticed, as\r\nhe went his shy way around the town, performed the small services that\r\nhe was able to, unknown to the recipients. Some little aid, some little\r\nkindness every day. He was happy._\r\n\r\n_Then they brought Henry Jones, bitter and disillusioned, home from\r\nthe hospital in the city. He had been kicked in the head by a horse\r\nwhile he was away at college, and would never see again. The doctors\r\nall agreed on that point. He was permanently blind. Carl was trimming\r\nthe Jones\' hedge the first day that they pushed Henry out for his daily\r\nairing in the sun. He saw the blood clot that blocked the nerves to the\r\nbrain center and his powerful mind worked smoothly, efficiently._\r\n\r\n_"Open your eyes," Carl said simply. "You can see."_\r\n\r\n_"It was a miracle," everyone said. "A true miracle."_\r\n\r\n_The newspapers scented a lucky circumstance and whipped up a human\r\ninterest story that was more fantasy than fact; the wire services\r\ncarried the story and people flocked to see the person who had\r\nperformed a miracle. By twos and threes they came. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
Then by scores. They\r\ncame to see because they were curious, or to be healed of some real or\r\nimagined ill. By the hundreds, by the thousands, they came. The lame,\r\nthe halt, and the blind. The doctors, lawyers, ministers, newspaper\r\nmen, newsreel cameramen, zealots. Men, women and children; from near\r\nand afar. The religious, and the heretics. He couldn\'t begin to help\r\nall of those who came to him. Some, with missing organs or diseased in\r\na manner impossible for him to aid, were turned away and added their\r\ncries to the pack who bitterly denounced him. For the most part his\r\nwork was confined to the eyes of a few, but the numbers of those he\r\nhelped without their knowledge he knew were legend._\r\n\r\n_The crowd expected to see miracles and they demanded to see them. His\r\nfailure to perform according to their tastes set off disputes that\r\nswept across the country. Was he a healer or a charlatan? A wise man or\r\na fool? A public benefactor or a fraud?_\r\n\r\n_"He has never healed anyone," learned doctors gave statements to the\r\npapers. "It\'s all a matter of mass hypnosis. He tells the ignorant that\r\nthey are cured and, for a short while they actually force themselves to\r\nbelieve that they are cured. A very simple matter, indeed."_\r\n\r\n_He went on ministering to the crowds that increased daily. He asked\r\nnothing for his work, and they gave nothing; but the popcorn vendors,\r\nthe soda pop dispensers, the ice cream wagons, had a field day. It was\r\na circus and they assigned extra policemen to control the frenzied\r\ncrowds._\r\n\r\n_He remembered the day, finally, they brought a little girl, suffering\r\nfrom leukemia, from a distant city. The best doctors had given their\r\nbest to save her, and they had failed. The distraught parents were\r\ngrasping at the last straw. He knew that it was much, much too late for\r\nhim to do anything to aid her, but he tried. She looked at him with her\r\nlarge, beautiful eyes, set so deep in her pale face, and arose from the\r\nambulance couch and walked a few steps toward him. Then she collapsed\r\nand died. The eager crowd pushed forward to get a better view and some\r\nwere trampled. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
Some were injured, and some, the weak and unlucky, were\r\nkilled. The police, frightened and faced with an ugly situation for\r\nwhich they had no rules, arrested him and whisked him off to the county\r\nseat. The crowd slowly dispersed and soon the only evidence that they\r\nhad ever been there was the mass of empty cartons, the soda bottles,\r\nand the damaged shrubbery in the town square...._\r\n\r\nThe judge leaned over from his tall bench.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Sloan," he said sonorously. "In view of the evidence presented\r\nby the people of this state this court has no recourse but to convict\r\nyou for the deaths of seven people. The court finds you charged and\r\nadjudged guilty of five counts, four minor and one major. Perpetrator\r\nof an unlawful assembly, inciting a mob to violence--" the voice droned\r\non and on until the sentence was pronounced.\r\n\r\nThe flash bulbs popped and the crowd mumbled and whispered as he was\r\nled back to his cell. He had known from the beginning of the trial\r\nthat there could be but one ending. He hadn\'t asked for the deaths of\r\nanyone but through him they had died and it was best that the sentence\r\nof the court be exacted and the Gift forever stilled. The world was not\r\nready for a power such as this, he knew. Not now, not yet, perhaps not\r\never....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe wrought iron gates in the high stone wall clanged shut behind\r\nthe official county car with a dismal finality. Later, he was taken\r\nto a small room and his clothes stripped from him, replaced with a\r\nsimple two pieced garment. This, then, was to be the end of life,\r\nof awareness. No more to feel the warmth of the summer sun or\r\nthe caressing coolness of the light spring wind. Yet, he felt no\r\nbitterness, no regrets, rather only a sense of vast loneliness in the\r\nknowledge that he would not be able to fulfill the promise of his life.\r\n\r\nStraps were placed around his ankles and secured so that the sudden\r\nshock wouldn\'t tear them loose. A strap around each leg, just above the\r\nknee. More, biting into his wrists, his upper arms, and, finally, the\r\ntwo plates. They were placed carefully, one just behind and above each\r\near. A last quiet check to see that the bindings were in their proper\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nThe plates held his head in a vise-like grip and he couldn\'t turn it in\r\nany direction but he knew the time was at hand....\r\n\r\nThere was a sharp pain, blinding and searing. Starting in his head,\r\njust behind his eyes, and then permeating throughout his muscles and\r\nbody. He jerked spasmodically, but the strong bonds held him fast.\r\nFor a long agonizing moment the pain persisted, and then the welcome\r\nblackness, nothing....\r\n\r\nThe young interne smiled at the officiating doctor.\r\n\r\n"That was a very nice operation, sir. A wonderful discovery that\r\nelectronically destroying a part of the brain will cure some forms of\r\ninsanity. Of course, he won\'t have much of his ego left, but he will be\r\nable to obey simple orders and do menial tasks, and, at least he will\r\nbe sane."\r\n\r\n"Yes," the doctor said cheerfully as he disconnected his apparatus, "at\r\nleast he will be sane."\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
