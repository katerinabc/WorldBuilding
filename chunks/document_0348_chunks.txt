Harris\r\n\r\n               Murph was a man to be admired, Pete knew,\r\n            for Murph had a silver rocket and a passport to\r\n           the stars. Now Murph had promised him a ride....\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Imagination Stories of Science and Fantasy\r\n                             October 1957\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCareful to keep trees and bushes between himself and the cottage, the\r\nboy legged it across the fields toward the glass rocket poised in\r\nJohnson\'s pasture, glittering and slim like a dark, slender dancer. To\r\nPete it was all the promise in the world distilled into a pointed black\r\nglass bottle. But to the women in the cottage....\r\n\r\nHe glanced back. Apparently they hadn\'t seen him. He had to hurry,\r\nbecause he had something to ask Murph Vanderpool, the rocketman, and\r\nsometime tomorrow the rocket would be gone.\r\n\r\nHis grandmother and his mother would be glad when it was gone. To them\r\nit was a monstrous and terrible symbol of something, and, like an evil\r\nwoman, most terrible because of its beauty.\r\n\r\n"Just can\'t get away from them," his grandmother had said at lunch,\r\ngazing irefully out the window toward where it stood. She was a\r\nstiffbacked old lady with a valentine face where something wintry mixed\r\nwith something mild. "I moved out here on the edge of a little town and\r\nthought I\'d got away from \'em--and the television\'s full of \'em--and\r\nthe magazines full of \'em--and now this barnstormer sets one down\r\npractically in the backyard!"\r\n\r\nPete curled his brows in a way that made the women remember his father.\r\n"What\'s wrong with rockets, Grammy?"\r\n\r\n"No reason for them! No reason for men to want to go way off hundreds\r\nof miles from earth, getting lost, getting killed! We had jets--we\r\nshould have been satisfied."\r\n\r\nShe sighed, and her daughter-in-law echoed it. Looking out the window\r\ntheir thoughts ran to space and rockets and their men, who had been\r\nrocketmen and who would never come back. What was left of them was\r\nstill out there, moving eternally through lonesome space in straight\r\nlines or circling some dead moon or planet. The gray-haired woman\'s\r\nthoughts ran to the husband torn and destroyed when the early test ship\r\nburst on the moon-run, and the other woman\'s mind reached grieving\r\ntoward her own husband, the gray-haired woman\'s son, whose ship had\r\nturned in an instant to a molten glob when its white metal coating\r\nsuddenly peeled and it took the full, brutal hammer of the sun.\r\n\r\nThe younger ran her fingers through Pete\'s spiky hair. "Petey, you\'re\r\nnot to see that barnstormer any more."\r\n\r\n"Aw--fooher! Fooner!"\r\n\r\nHis grandmother raised her hands. "Where do they pick up that awful\r\nslang?"\r\n\r\nPete scowled out the window, thinking of the rocket, the knobs and\r\nslings and dials within it, the feel of speed and space and war about\r\nit, the slash-grinned young god who rode it. He had something to ask\r\nMurph.\r\n\r\n"Aw fooner," he muttered.\r\n\r\nHis mother swung him to her lap. "Shall we tell him about the surprise?"\r\n\r\nPete thought he caught something odd--a nearly invisible craft or\r\nknowingness--in the glance they traded.\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t get much for your birthday last week, Pete," his mother\r\nbeamed, "so we decided to give you a kind of late birthday party.\r\nYou\'re going to have that picnic on Indian Hill. It\'ll be an all-day\r\npicnic, with all the youngsters you know, hunting for arrowheads and\r\nrelics. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
We\'re going in Mr. Fobey\'s copter."\r\n\r\n"Oh boy! Indian Hill! At last!" Then he sobered, thinking of paunchy,\r\nbland-faced, nervous Mr. Fobey.\r\n\r\n"Will Fobey bring his air sluice?"\r\n\r\n"He says he will.

=== Chunk 3 ===
"\r\n\r\n"All right then. Indian Hill! Whoopee!"\r\n\r\nHe kissed them, and went larking toward the door but his mother snagged\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"I hope you aren\'t forgetting your chores, young man."\r\n\r\n"Yeah--weeding. I don\'t see why we don\'t have all ponics, like\r\neverybody else. Gee whiz, can\'t I skip it just today. It\'s the next to\r\nthe last day for the Hester."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the Hester, for goodness sake?"\r\n\r\n"Why, the rocket! The glass rocket!"\r\n\r\nShe held her son\'s head between her hands and held her eyes on his.\r\n"Pete, we told you not to go near that rocket. I mean it. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Stay ...\r\naway ... from ... it! I know what I\'m saying. Stay away from it!"\r\n\r\nHe scuffled his feet. "Okay mom. Okay then. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Okay."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later he was legging it across the fields, keeping trees\r\nand shrubs between himself and the cottage, and three quarters of an\r\nhour later he was handing a crescent wrench to Murph Vanderpool, who\r\nhad found a loose bolt in the rig of the doube-slung pilot\'s cradle.\r\nWeeding was forgotten. His nostrils were full of hexadrine, his eyes\r\nwere full of dials and levers and words like "parsecs" and "off ram--on\r\nram," and his head was full of dreams.\r\n\r\nThe Hester. Ever so slightly scored along her sides with the nailhead\r\nmeteorites she had brushed rushingly aside. An imperceptible waver in\r\nher hull where a Panasia heat shell had nearly downed her. Glamorous\r\nwitch of space. Cleopatra\'s needle of outer gulfs.\r\n\r\nHe knew about her. The Federation had won the war when they began\r\ncasting rockets of the new, light, tough glass, mass-producing swarms\r\nto oust Panasia in the battles fought in the black deeps beyond the\r\nbounds of earth with weapons that would have destroyed both sides if\r\nused on the home planet. And after the war thousands of the rockets had\r\nbeen sold, and many had gone to the young men like Murph whom the war\r\nhad made into spacemen before they had a chance at any other business\r\nand who did not want now, ever, to be anything but spacemen, rocketmen.\r\nThey went about the country selling rocket rides. Tradition had given\r\nthem a name from another postwar epoch: barnstormers.\r\n\r\nPete handed the wrench to the barnstormer. "Which are the dark-light\r\ncontrols?"\r\n\r\n"Holy tubes," grinned Murph, pushing the black hair from his eyes, "If\r\nyou weren\'t such a handy kid you\'d be a nuisance. Here." He pushed a\r\nbutton, and the dark hull grew clear, letting in the sunlight. Murph\r\npushed deeper and the hull darkened. He twirled and a long, clear\r\nporthole appeared along the rows of seats.\r\n\r\n"Polaroid can keep radion or light--sunlight can be enough to kill you.\r\nOr you can clear a place to look through."\r\n\r\n"Can I work it, huh?

=== Chunk 6 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Just once."\r\n\r\nPete manipulated the button. Then he held his breath, glanced at Murph,\r\nand slipped into the pilot\'s cradle. It was too wide and deep but he\r\nimagined that he filled it. He imagined the switchboard alive and\r\nwinking and his body weighing a thousand tons, then weighing nothing at\r\nall. The Hester had passed escape velocity, cast off gravity, and earth\r\nlay already ten thousand miles behind her. The board showed she had\r\nslewed a little because of the slight warp in the hull. He corrected\r\ncourse. Then he cut power, and the ship went driving on with nothing to\r\nstop it at thirty thousand miles an hour.\r\n\r\nMurph let him sit there a full minute. Then he lifted him down.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s go outside, see if there\'s any business."\r\n\r\nThere wasn\'t, and they lounged on a piece of canvas in the blackened\r\nblast area.\r\n\r\nThe band-radio around Pete\'s shoulder pulsed gently. He dialed it up.\r\n\r\n"I know where you are, Peter. I want you back here right this instant.\r\nYour mother and I both...."\r\n\r\nHe dialed off.\r\n\r\n"Anything else I can do for you, Murph?"\r\n\r\n"Well--you might go to Rannel\'s store, after awhile, and get me a\r\ncouple packs of self-lights. I\'m about out of smokes.

=== Chunk 7 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Be glad to."\r\n\r\nPete basked in the shared male moments. "What was it you were telling\r\nme about hyperspace yesterday?"\r\n\r\nMurph told him more about hyperspace, the untapped dimension which\r\nhad to exist, the magic hole in space into which a ship would slip\r\nsomeday and emerge not in new systems but new galaxies. "When we find\r\nhyperspace and get the photon drive--then we\'ll really be making it."\r\n\r\n"Think we ever will?"\r\n\r\n"Sure we will."\r\n\r\nThat was it. Sure we will. He lay and gazed into the sky. How far did\r\nit go? Someday he would be up there.\r\n\r\nThe radio pulsed again, and he told himself he didn\'t feel it. He\r\nrolled around and looked at Murph. He might as well ask his important\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n"Murph--are you gonna take me up?"\r\n\r\n"Shoot, kid, I can\'t burn juice just taking one guy for a joyride."\r\n\r\n"How about if you get a full load except one? Couldn\'t I sit in?

=== Chunk 8 ===
"\r\n\r\nMurph thought about it. "Well, you\'ve been a lot of help and company,\r\nand you\'re a smart kid, too. I\'ll do it."\r\n\r\nPete didn\'t do anything so childish as leaping into the air but he\r\nallowed himself to walk over and stroke the alluring flanks of the\r\nHester. He felt wonderful. And around the hull of the rocket strode his\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t you answer us?"\r\n\r\n"Gosh--did you call me? Maybe my radio isn\'t working."\r\n\r\nShe dialed and spoke into it. His grandmother answered. "I\'ve got him,"\r\nsaid his mother, and dialed down.\r\n\r\nShe took him by the arm and shook him. "Come along!

=== Chunk 9 ===
"\r\n\r\n"That\'s scranny! I\'ve got to get Murph cigarettes! He\'s going to take\r\nme up! Ain\'t that right, Murph?"\r\n\r\nMurph had scrambled up, red and apologetic. "I\'m sorry, lady--I didn\'t\r\nknow you wanted him home. I\'m really sorry."\r\n\r\n"You idiot!" was all she said, flouncing by him with Pete held by the\r\narm.\r\n\r\nShe shook Pete more and more angrily as they half ran toward home. Then\r\nsuddenly he felt her trembling all over, and she broke into tears.\r\n\r\nShe held him to her fiercely and suffocatingly. "They\'re _not_ going to\r\nget you. You\'re going to promise!"\r\n\r\nBewildered and a little frightened, he pushed his head against her like\r\na stubborn calf and was silent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe felt a little chastened by the time they arrived home, but then\r\nthings blew up again. Grammy pulled the trigger. Smiling, she hugged\r\nhim and said, "Cheer up, Pete--tomorrow\'s the picnic on Indian Hill."\r\n\r\nThey were using Indian Hill to cancel out his last day with the Hester!\r\nHe gritted his teeth with a scrawtch that raised goose pimples even on\r\nhimself. "I won\'t go! It doesn\'t have to be tomorrow!"\r\n\r\nGrammy\'s face began to winter and his mother\'s face grew harder as she\r\nsaid, very firmly, "It\'s tomorrow, and you certainly _are_ coming."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t!" he exploded, and ran out to the barn.\r\n\r\nHe lay in the hay in the tallest now, feeling like a miserable sick\r\nsolitary cat. After awhile he dialed his radio, 29 on the eight orb,\r\nand Murph came right in.\r\n\r\n"How\'s it goin\', Murph?"\r\n\r\n"Oh--it\'s you. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
You in trouble?"\r\n\r\n"Nah--but I can\'t see you today. I wondered if you could take me up\r\ntomorrow? I mean, if there\'s room, that is?"\r\n\r\n"Your Ma want you to go up?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s okay--they just wanted me for chores today. How about it?"\r\n\r\n"Sure, if there\'s room."\r\n\r\n"Hooray! See you tomorrow."\r\n\r\n"Okay, kid. And look--if you don\'t make it, I\'ll blow you a kiss."\r\n\r\n"What\'s that?"\r\n\r\n"I thought you knew. You know how the jet flame is? Blue. Well, if\r\nyou change the fuel mix it goes orange. That\'s blowing a kiss. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
Every\r\nrocketman knows about it."\r\n\r\n"Wow! I\'ll be there, though. You won\'t have to blow me one."\r\n\r\n"Okay, Pete."\r\n\r\n"Okay, Murph."\r\n\r\nThey dialed out.\r\n\r\nHe lay in the hay a long time, making his plans. In the morning the\r\nwomen were delighted with him. He bubbled about relics and Indian bones\r\nand pranced and paced and kept running to the window to look for Mr.\r\nFobey\'s copter. When it settled and the port opened he whooped aboard,\r\nthe first one on, and scrambled into the baggage hold. He slammed the\r\nlittle door and slid a screwdriver between the knob and the door frame.\r\n\r\nUp forward, he heard the others boarding. I gotta work fast, he told\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nSomebody began to pound on the little door. "Petey\'s in there!" piped\r\na voice. "He won\'t let anybody else in!"\r\n\r\nHe could tell it was old blabbermouth Sally Doolittle, that all the\r\nkids called a nosey little squirt.\r\n\r\n"I\'m gonna watch through the glass deck!" he yelled. "It\'s my party,\r\nand I\'m gonna watch alone."\r\n\r\nCrouching in the small hold, he began to work at the catches of the\r\nunloading hatch. He wasn\'t sure it opened from the inside--but it had\r\nto. He had to drop through before the copter left the ground.\r\n\r\nThe motors started.\r\n\r\nHe heard his mother\'s voice. "That\'s not like you, Pete. What are you\r\ndoing in there? Open this door!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m trying," he called. "The lock\'s busted."\r\n\r\nHe got the last catch loose and strained up on the hatch. As it opened\r\nthe copter lifted. He stared downward. They were high and getting\r\nhigher. He\'d better drop quick. Murph wouldn\'t have been scared he told\r\nhimself, and plummeted through the opening.\r\n\r\nHe hit on his toes, let his legs buckle, and rolled into a hedge. His\r\nfeet felt as though bombs had gone off under them. He lay half stunned;\r\nwaiting for the copter to get well off, then tried to stand up.\r\n\r\nHe was able to. He tried to walk, and was able to. He began to run\r\nacross the fields, skirting trees and bushes. If the baggage door held\r\nshut and they didn\'t see him above, he had plenty of time to get to\r\nMurph and into the Hester.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe was halfway there when the copter veered and came humming back. It\r\ncame dropping toward him and he knew he was spotted. He ran stumbling\r\ninto a stretch of trees and woods, altered course and dropped behind a\r\nbig rock at the edge of the trees. There were leaves drifted against it\r\nand he burrowed under them. Panting, sweaty and itching, with aching\r\nlegs, he watched and listened as the copter landed.\r\n\r\nThe port opened and they poured out. "He doesn\'t know what he\'s doing,"\r\nsaid his mother. "We\'re going to find him."\r\n\r\nMr. Fobey drew back a little, his rubbery face pink-creased and\r\nnervous. "In there--in all the brush and snakes and swamp?"\r\n\r\nShe set her jaw and touched his arm. "I\'m counting on you, Mr. 

=== Chunk 12 ===
Fobey."\r\n\r\nThey entered the woods, the children ranging ahead like shrill,\r\nbloodhungry little pups, poking and peeping and rustling. Pete tried to\r\nlie like a stone beneath the leaves.\r\n\r\nThe adults might not have found him, but the children hunted him\r\neagerly and fiercely, like some huge prize Easter egg, and the sudden\r\nscreech of little Sally Doolittle skirled his discovery.\r\n\r\nMr. Fobey came up first. Pete stood up, leaf-cluttered, and screamed at\r\nhim. "You\'re a stupid fat crot!" he shrilled. "A crot! A godamn stupid\r\nfat crot, and leave me alone, I\'m not going with you!"\r\n\r\nBut he did go with them.\r\n\r\nOn Indian Hill, Fobey set up his air sluice, stripping off the soil as\r\ndust and laying it back down as dirt. They turned up flint arrowheads\r\nand pestels and they found a buried skeleton, an orange smear on the\r\nbreast bone where a talisman bag had lain. The children cheered and\r\nlaughed and quarrelled--all but Pete. Pete climbed a tall pine.\r\n\r\nAll afternoon he watched the black glass rocket lift high on its fine\r\nblue skirt and streak toward the cold black place of stars, and come\r\ndropping back like a needle that is light as a feather, to take on more\r\njoyriders and swoop back upward. It was like watching unfolding poems\r\nin motion.\r\n\r\n_I\'ll be a spaceman_, he told himself. _I don\'t care what happens, I\'m\r\ngoing to be a spaceman!_ He stayed in the tree all day and watched\r\nthe Hester rise and return and on the last flight, when she lifted on\r\na voyage that would terminate in some other part of the country in\r\nsome other field, he saw the regal blue of the jet suddenly flush to a\r\ndeep rose orange, then back to blue, and he thought of Murph and was\r\nsuddenly happy. His day would come.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
