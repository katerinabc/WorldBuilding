]\r\n\r\n\r\nThompson poured himself a shot of rye and downed it in one quick\r\nmovement. He then pulled out his tobacco pouch, filled his pipe and\r\napplied a flaming match to the bowl. He puffed clouds of fragrant\r\nsmoke. He frowned deeply. It was a good frown because Thompson was an\r\nexpert in the art of frowning. This particular frown was a frown of\r\nirritated exasperation, because Thompson was an author, and it was late\r\nat night, and he\'d drunk a quarter of a fifth of rye and smoked eleven\r\npipefuls of tobacco and played four LP records, and he still had no\r\nideas. His head swam from the effects of the whisky, and the tobacco,\r\nand the records; but he persevered in his search for An Idea for a\r\nStory.\r\n\r\nHe searched among his records for _Le Coq d\'Or_ and put it on the\r\nphonograph, at bass tone and loud volume. After the first few bars he\r\ngot up and took it off, still a man without inspiration. He played\r\nHindemith\'s _Variations on a Theme by Russell_ next. Utterly useless.\r\nHe tried _The Age of Anxiety_ and followed it with Petrouchka;\r\nintermittently he sat down and pondered passages from _Rubaiyat_. All\r\nto no avail.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the little green men came out of the woodwork. They\r\ndidn\'t emerge from the woodwork in the manner one might expect--i.e.\r\nsqueezing through cracks and knotholes like mice and spiders. They just\r\nsort of materialized out of it, rather like they had walked through it.\r\nThere were four of them.\r\n\r\nThompson took his pipe from his mouth and looked at them.\r\n\r\n"Ah," he murmured. "Yes indeed." He knocked the ashes from his pipe and\r\ngot up from his chair. He put the whisky back in the cupboard and took\r\nthe record off. Then he sat down again and regarded the little green\r\nmen. He closed his eyes tightly and held them closed for a minute or\r\nso. He opened them and looked at the green men again. Then he rubbed\r\nhis eyes and pounded his head with his hands. The green men sat in\r\nmid-air and stared at him. Thompson regarded them as coldly as possible.\r\n\r\n"Well," said the nearest green man, "Aren\'t you going to say hello?"\r\n\r\nThompson swallowed. "Hello," he managed after a moment.\r\n\r\n"Hello," rejoined the other.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThompson nodded his head affably and remained silent. Presently he went\r\nto the cupboard and got out the whisky; he poured a shot and downed it\r\nin one quick movement. Then he filled his pipe and lit it. He puffed\r\nclouds of smoke and stared at the green men through a blue haze.\r\n\r\n"Well," said the nearest green man again, "Aren\'t you glad?"\r\n\r\nThompson nodded genially.\r\n\r\n"We\'re here to help you write a story, you know," pursued the other.\r\n\r\n"Oh." Thompson brightened. "Good. Got any ideas?"\r\n\r\n"Naturally. What would you like to write about? Romance? Adventure?\r\nMystery? Fantasy?"\r\n\r\n"Let\'s try--" Thompson pursed his lips and looked at the ceiling, "a\r\nshort mystery. Something with a surprise ending that lays you out."\r\n\r\n"Easy," said the other. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
"Try this."\r\n\r\nHe began narrating.\r\n\r\nThompson relaxed in his chair and puffed more clouds of smoke.\r\nPresently his face lit up. His eyes dilated and his pupils diminished\r\nto specks.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" He exclaimed. He pulled his chair up to the typewriter and\r\nstarted typing notes, interspersing the green man\'s narrative with\r\nmuttered exclamations.\r\n\r\nThe green man finished with an ending that sent Thompson over backwards\r\nin his chair. Thompson extricated himself and set up the chair again.\r\n"Terrific!" he said. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
"It\'ll make my fortune!"\r\n\r\n"It will," assented the green man.\r\n\r\n"What do you want for it?" inquired Thompson craftily.\r\n\r\n"Nothing," responded the vision.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes," said Thompson. "Nothing. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Certainly. Well," he withdrew a\r\nstack of typewriter paper from his cluttered desk, "I certainly thank\r\nyou fellows. Goodbye." He inserted a sheet in the typewriter.\r\n\r\n"Oh, we\'re not leaving," said the off-color gnome.\r\n\r\n"You will," said Thompson imperturbably. "In the morning. I\'ll have a\r\nheadache but you\'ll be gone."\r\n\r\n"Suit yourself," said the green man. He and his companions rose a foot\r\nin the air and sat suspended again. Thompson began to type. Now and\r\nthen he looked at the green men and smiled, and turned back to his\r\nclick-clacking on the typewriter.\r\n\r\nTwenty double-spaced pages later he was done. He made a neat stack of\r\nthe sheets and shoved them into an envelope, handily pre-addressed to\r\nthe editorial offices of one of the more prominent magazines. He sealed\r\nthe envelope and slapped postage on it. Then he walked three flights\r\ndown from his apartment to the street, slipped the envelope into a\r\nmailbox, and staggered back up to bed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe awoke, true to his prediction, with a raging headache. He sat up\r\nin bed and looked around the room for the little green men. They were\r\nnowhere to be seen. His doubts assuaged, he rose stiffly from his bed\r\nand careened off the chest-of-drawers into the bathroom, where he\r\nswallowed three aspirins in a glass of water. He turned on the water\r\nto see if it was hot, letting it run over his fingers. It was. He took\r\na steaming shower and followed it with an icy one. Then he rubbed\r\nhimself down with a Turkish towel and, the towel precariously wrapped\r\naround his middle, went back into the bedroom. His eyes bugged out and\r\nhe tripped on the edge of the rug and fell heavily to the floor. When\r\nhe got up four green men were still sitting complacently on a shaft of\r\nsunlight that poured in through the Venetian blind.\r\n\r\nThompson\'s mouth opened and closed but nothing came out.\r\n\r\n"See," said the nearest green man. "I told you so. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
And don\'t take on\r\nso," he added in alarm. "You\'ll dislocate your jaw."\r\n\r\nThompson turned his back to the vision and went into the cupboard. He\r\npoured a shot of rye and downed it in one quick movement. The bottle in\r\nhis hand, he sat down on the edge of the bed, regaining his composure.\r\n\r\n"Why do you do that?" inquired the gnome with curiosity.\r\n\r\n"If I\'m going to go on seeing you," Thompson explained, "I may as well\r\nbe drunk. It helps."\r\n\r\n"You mean you still attribute our existence to the effects of alcohol?"\r\ninquired the other.\r\n\r\n"Oh no," Thompson denied vigorously. "To the bitters."\r\n\r\n"You jest," said the gnome in hurt tones. "Don\'t you want to become a\r\ngreat author?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly," Thompson agreed hastily. "You mean you have more ideas?"\r\n\r\n"An infinite number," said the green man, waving a deprecatory hand.\r\n"We thought of an excellent novel," he added, "while you slept last\r\nnight. Do you want to hear it?

=== Chunk 7 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Of course!" Thompson jerked on his shorts. "Wait, though. I need\r\nbreakfast first." He writhed into a shirt.\r\n\r\n"Plenty of time," said the greenie. "While you\'re gone, we\'ll\r\nassimilate some more ideas."\r\n\r\n"Good," said Thompson, pulling on his trousers. "Shall I bring you\r\nsomething to eat?"\r\n\r\n"We don\'t eat," said the other airily. "You can bring a spotlight,\r\nthough. We can sit best on a beam of light.

=== Chunk 8 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Right," said Thompson. He opened the door.\r\n\r\n"Goodbye," remarked the gnome.\r\n\r\n"Goodbye," Thompson hurried from the room.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThompson closed the door of the phone booth behind him. "Hello," he\r\nsaid. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
"I\'d like to make an appointment with Doctor Vossman. Today, if\r\npossible."\r\n\r\n"Just a moment," said the secretary. He heard her riffle through some\r\npapers. "What date did you say you wanted an appointment?"\r\n\r\n"Today!" Thompson repeated. His breathing into the mouthpiece came out\r\nquite clearly in the receiver against his ear.\r\n\r\n"Doctor Vossman can see you today at three. What is the name, please?"\r\n\r\n"Thompson. Laurence Thompson."\r\n\r\n"Very well, sir. Today at three."\r\n\r\n"OK." Thompson hung up and emerged from the phone booth. His ham and\r\neggs were ready at the counter and he sat down and wolfed them. He\r\ncounted his money as he went out and decided to stop in the hardware\r\nstore down the street and buy a spotlight.\r\n\r\nWhen he got back to his apartment the sunlight was coming in the\r\nwindow at a forty-five degree angle and the gnomes were almost sitting\r\non the floor. Thompson plugged in the spotlight and turned the beam\r\nupward. "There," he told the green men. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
"That okay?"\r\n\r\n"Thank you," said the nearest gnome. The whole group rose in the air\r\nand floated over to the spotlight beam, sitting rather comfortably on\r\nthe edge of it. "We thought of three excellent short stories while you\r\nwere away. Would you like to hear them?"\r\n\r\n"Yeah, sure," responded Thompson. Might as well take advantage of the\r\nsituation while it lasted.\r\n\r\n"Very well," said the nearest green man. "Here\'s the first one."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt two o\'clock Thompson jerked the last sheet of the last story from\r\nthe typewriter. He went to the cupboard and got out a coat and tie.\r\n"I\'m going to lunch," he told the gnomes, knotting the tie as he\r\ntalked. "I\'ll be back pretty soon."\r\n\r\n"Fine," beamed the speaker for the little men.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Thompson uncomfortably, slipping into his coat. "You want\r\nanything more?"\r\n\r\n"We\'re nicely comfortable, thank you," said the green man. "Goodbye.

=== Chunk 11 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Be seein\' you." Thompson slammed the door behind him and added to\r\nhimself, "I hope not."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe sign on the door said:\r\n\r\n                            HERMAN VOSSMAN:\r\n                             PSYCHIATRIST\r\n                                Walk in\r\n\r\nThompson walked in. There was nobody in the outer office so he walked\r\nto the inner office door and knocked.\r\n\r\n"Come in," answered a German accent.\r\n\r\nThompson entered and beheld a small, thin, bespectacled man seated\r\nbehind a modernistic steel desk.\r\n\r\n"Ah," said this apparition. "You are Laurence Thompson. Sit down. Sorry\r\nno one was in the outer office but my secretary is out to lunch. What\r\ncan I do for you."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Thompson. "This is kind of hard to say, Doctor, but\r\nI\'m--seeing things. Hallucinations."\r\n\r\n"What are you seeing, Mr. Thompson?"\r\n\r\nThompson fingered the end of his tie. "Little green men."\r\n\r\n"Ah," said the doctor. He leaned forward in his chair. "And what do\r\nthese little green men do?"\r\n\r\n"They give me ideas for stories. I\'m an author."\r\n\r\n"That is all they do?"\r\n\r\n"They sit on a beam of light, too."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes." The doctor took off his spectacles and began to polish them.\r\n"On a beam of light, of course. When and how did you first see these\r\nlittle men?"\r\n\r\n"Well," Thompson ran nervous fingers through his hair, "Last night was\r\nwhen I first saw them. They came out of the woodwork."\r\n\r\n"Last night--" began the doctor with a flash of intuition.\r\n\r\n"I was drunk," said Thompson.\r\n\r\n"Of course," agreed the doctor. He put his spectacles back on. "Then\r\nyou have nothing to worry about; at least not in my line of work.\r\nPerhaps you should see a physician, delirium tremens is not in my line.\r\nUnless you wish me to cure your alcoholism--"\r\n\r\nThompson waved a hand. "Uh uh. 

=== Chunk 12 ===
Last night I didn\'t mind so much. But\r\nthey were there this morning too." He leaned forward toward the doctor.\r\n"Would you say I am drunk now?"\r\n\r\n"Hard to tell," rejoined the doctor, fluttering his fingers. 

=== Chunk 13 ===
"Offhand,\r\nI would say, no."\r\n\r\n"Well," Thompson, "the little green men were still there when I left my\r\napartment at two today."\r\n\r\n"I see," said the doctor. "That makes a difference, of course."\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t had but one shot of rye since last night, either."\r\n\r\n"Yes, of course," murmured the psychiatrist. "And do you think they are\r\nstill in your apartment now?"\r\n\r\nThompson shrugged. 

=== Chunk 14 ===
"Hard to tell."\r\n\r\n"Then," said the doctor confidently, "there is only one thing to do. We\r\nshall go to your apartment and see." He rose from his chair.\r\n\r\n"Good enough," replied Thompson.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Now," said Thompson, "we will see if they\'ve gone." He opened the door\r\nand peered into the room. He shuddered and entered the apartment; the\r\ndoctor followed and closed the door.\r\n\r\n"Are they here?" inquired the doctor, glancing about the room.\r\n\r\nThompson nodded and pointed. "Sitting on the beam of the spotlight."\r\n\r\n"Ah yes." The doctor gazed uncomfortably at the spotlight and gave a\r\nsigh. He pushed Thompson over to the bed. "Lie down," he said. "Do you\r\nhave a medicine cabinet?"\r\n\r\n"In the bathroom, Doc." Thompson pointed.\r\n\r\nThe doctor nodded and went into the bathroom and opened the cabinet.\r\nHe took out a bottle of antihistamine tablets and shook three into his\r\nhand. He drew a glass of water and walked back to Thompson\'s bedside.\r\n\r\n"Sit up," he said. "Here, take these."\r\n\r\nThompson downed the pills and took a swallow of water. The doctor\r\nset the glass on the bedside table and went over and turned off the\r\nspotlight.\r\n\r\n"Now," muttered the doctor. He turned on the lamp beside the bed and\r\nwrapped a green shirt around the bulb, tying the sleeves together at\r\nthe top. He turned the lamp on Thompson\'s face. "You say the little men\r\ngive you ideas for stories. Eh?"\r\n\r\nThompson shut his eyes and nodded. "On the desk. See?"\r\n\r\n"Oh!" The doctor exhaled. "You write the stories down?"\r\n\r\n"Naturally. They\'re great."\r\n\r\nThe doctor walked around to the desk, picked up one of the manuscripts.\r\nHe whistled softly. "Just relax," he said, turning to Thompson. "I\'m\r\ngoing to read these over."\r\n\r\n"Sure, doc." Thompson stretched out comfortably on the bed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn hour later the doctor was finishing the last story and humming\r\nsoftly to himself. He laid down the manuscript and fluttered his\r\nfingers airily. His face was a mask.\r\n\r\n"Now, Thompson," he said. "Look around the room. Are the little green\r\nmen still here?"\r\n\r\nThompson opened his eyes and gazed about the room. "Yep," he said\r\nfinally. "Over there in the corner, up by the ceiling."\r\n\r\nThe doctor didn\'t even look. He took off his spectacles and inserted\r\nthem carefully in his coat pocket. Then he fished a quarter from his\r\nhip pocket and held it up between two fingers.\r\n\r\n"Thompson," he said softly. "Look."\r\n\r\nThompson looked. The quarter spun. The lamp above his face cast a soft\r\ngreen light.\r\n\r\n"The little green men aren\'t there, Thompson."\r\n\r\n"Yes, they are," remarked Thompson petulantly.\r\n\r\n"No, they\'re not," soothed the doctor.\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"No," said the doctor firmly.\r\n\r\n"No?" inquired Thompson sleepily.\r\n\r\n"No.\r\n\r\n"You imagined them," breathed the doctor. "They aren\'t there. Not there\r\nat all. Can you hear me, Thompson?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Now forget all about your little green men. You can forget about them.\r\nYou will forget about them." The doctor\'s voice was a monotone.\r\n"They ... never were there. You will never see them again. Never,\r\nThompson. Never see them again. Never again. Thompson. Now go to sleep.\r\nYou\'ve been dreaming."\r\n\r\nThompson relaxed.\r\n\r\n"Thompson?"\r\n\r\nThe sleeping man lay still, eyes shut, breathing even. The doctor\r\nexhaled softly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Why did you do that?" queried the nearest green man. "He\'s convinced.\r\nHe\'ll never see us again."\r\n\r\n"Naturally," said the doctor. He didn\'t even turn around. He got his\r\nspectacles out of his pocket and adjusted them on his nose. He turned\r\nto face the little green men.\r\n\r\n"Come on," he said, waving a hand toward the door. "All my life I\'ve\r\nwanted to be a great author. You fellows are going to tell me what to\r\nwrite!"\r\n\r\nThe green men shifted several feet nearer to him. "Crime, weird,\r\nmystery, adventure, or romance?" said the nearest gnome.\r\n\r\n"Fantasy," said the doctor, "Let\'s go!"\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
