!_\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n                      Amazing Stories July 1962.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the most part, all Harold Worthington Smith\'s Martian stories\r\never netted him were standard rejection slips, but every now and then\r\none or another of the editors to whom he submitted them would pen him\r\na brief note to the effect that his writing indicated an unusually\r\nvivid imagination. However, they invariably added, his dialogue was\r\nstilted, his heroines were dimensionally impossible, and his stories\r\nwere wish-fulfillment reveries in a Burroughs vein--unredeemed,\r\nunfortunately, by Burroughs\' high-flown puritanical idealism.\r\n\r\nHarold agreed with them wholeheartedly on point no. 1. Thanks to\r\nhis ability to achieve total identification with his protagonists,\r\nhe did have an unusually vivid imagination. Take this very minute,\r\nfor instance: His main character--Thon Carther the Earthman--was\r\nstanding on the ocher moss of the Martian dead-sea bottom beside the\r\nbig-breasted blond princess whom he had rescued from Tarkia some two\r\nthousand words ago, fearlessly awaiting the oncoming horde of Tarks.\r\nBut it wasn\'t really Thon Carther who was standing there, it was Harold\r\nWorthington Smith--a tall, tanned and handsome Harold Worthington\r\nSmith, to be sure, but Harold Worthington Smith just the same.\r\n\r\nOn points no. 2 and 3, however--be it said forthwith--he did not agree.\r\nHe had, moreover, written to the editors in question and said so. A\r\nBurroughs influence, he had said, was an essential ingredient in the\r\nmakeup of any science-fiction writer, and he was reasonably certain\r\nthat he didn\'t exhibit one any more than half a dozen other scribes he\r\ncould name. And as for his heroines being dimensionally impossible,\r\nsuch an attitude merely betrayed an inherent geocentricism: simply\r\nbecause 46-21-46 females didn\'t exist on Earth was no reason to take it\r\nfor granted that they didn\'t exist on Mars. (He discreetly avoided any\r\nreference to point no.

4: there were times when he wondered about his\r\ndialogue himself.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was a warm afternoon in August. His wife had gone to visit her\r\nsister, giving him temporary respite from her nagging, and there was no\r\nsound in the apartment except the steady hum of the electric fan and\r\nthe sporadic clacking of the ancient typewriter. Altogether it was one\r\nof those rare moments when it was possible for his imagination to take\r\nover completely. It was, in fact, though he was not yet aware of it,\r\nthe climactic moment in his career as a creative writer.\r\n\r\nThe Tark horde was rapidly closing in, and Thon Carther/Harold\r\nWorthington Smith decided it was high time he drew his sword.\r\n_Clackety-clack-clack._ The blond princess, who hailed from the triple\r\ncities of Hydrogen and whose name was Thejah Doris, moved closer to\r\nhim, and her golden shoulder brushed his sinewy arm. A tingling phalanx\r\nof thrills charged up and down his backbone. _Clack-clackety-clack.\r\nClack!_\r\n\r\n"Fear not, my princess," he said. "This noble sword has tasted the\r\nblood of many a Tark and is keen for the taste of the blood of many\r\nmore!"\r\n\r\n"My chieftain," she breathed, moving even closer.\r\n\r\nHe hefted the big sword, and the rays of the declining sun danced\r\nbrightly on its burnished surface. For all its size, it was as light as\r\na yardstick in his big brown masculine hand. The foremost Tark rider\r\nwas very close now. Startlingly close, Thon-Smith realized with a\r\nstart--and startlingly realistic. The malevolent green features stood\r\nout with dismaying clarity, and the tusks of the elongated eyeteeth\r\ngleamed with terrifying vividness.\r\n\r\nWildly Thon-Smith felt for his typewriter. Next he felt for his desk.\r\nFinally he looked around him for the familiar walls of the apartment.\r\nThey, too, had disappeared. A shudder shot through his tall, tanned\r\nbody. Something awful had happened.\r\n\r\nSomething even more awful was going to happen if he didn\'t do\r\nsomething and do it soon, for the Tarks, looming building-tall astride\r\ntheir six-legged mounts, were almost upon them. He remembered the plot\r\njust in time, and seizing Thejah Doris around her slender waist, he\r\ngave a mighty leap that carried them--thanks to the tenuous Martian\r\ngravity--over the entire green horde to a resilient section of the\r\ndead-sea bottom a hundred feet behind the rearmost rider. It was, he\r\nreflected, somewhat of a _deus ex machina_ stratagem now that he came\r\nto think of it; but now was no time to be hyper-critical.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Tark horde had become a milling mass of chlorophyllic bodies,\r\nwhite tusks and squealing mounts. The warriors in the front ranks had\r\ntele-reined their toats before those in the middle ranks had wised\r\nup to what had happened, and those in the rear ranks still hadn\'t\r\nwised up. Chaos reigned. Thon-Smith was not slow to take advantage\r\nof the situation which he had so fortuitously provided. He was still\r\nupset over his missing typewriter, his missing desk, and his missing\r\napartment, not to mention his missing civilization, but there would be\r\ntime for reconnaissance later. Right now there was the little matter of\r\nEscape to be taken care of.\r\n\r\nBriefly he referred to his mental synopsis of the plot. Oh, yes, there\r\nwas an atmosphere boat hidden in the mound of desiccated algae before\r\nwhich his leap had conveniently terminated. (Another _deus ex machina_\r\nstratagem, he thought with annoyance; but again he reminded himself\r\nthat now was no time to be quibbling over the literary aspects of the\r\nsituation.)\r\n\r\n"Come, my princess," he said, taking Thejah Doris\' arm.\r\n\r\n"Lead on, my chieftain!"\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere boat was there, just as he had visualized it. After\r\nuncovering it, they boarded its narrow deck, and soon they were\r\nrising into the darkening sky, once again thwarting the Tarks, who\r\nhad reorganized their ranks and were charging with redoubled ferocity\r\ntoward the mound.\r\n\r\nThejah Doris lay down beside him on the comfortable pilot\'s couch. "At\r\nlast we are alone!" she breathed in her Martian-Hungarian accent.\r\n\r\nReconnaissance could wait, Thon-Smith decided quickly. There were worse\r\nfates after all than writing oneself so completely into one\'s stories\r\nthat one could not extricate oneself. "My princess," he said, directing\r\nthe prow of the atmosphere boat toward the littoral of an ancient\r\ncontinent and slipping his arm beneath her bare shoulders.\r\n\r\nImmediately there came a frenzied scratching from the small forward\r\ncabin, and before he could even gain his feet a great eight-legged\r\ncreature with multi-fanged, slavering jaws leaped upon him and began\r\ncaressing his face with its long tongue. His faithful Droola! 

=== Chunk 4 ===
He\r\nwinced. He\'d forgotten all about his faithful watchdog. But a plot was\r\na plot, and like any other scheme of things you had to go along with\r\nit. "Droola," he said. "Good old faithful Droola!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPresently the nearer moon appeared and began its hurtling journey\r\nacross the night sky. Stars winked into cold clean brightness. The\r\natmosphere boat reached the mainland, floated over shadow-filled\r\nravines and moon-kissed hilltops. The argent ribbon of a canal showed\r\nin the distance.\r\n\r\nThon-Smith\'s heartbeat quickened as he thought of the next sequence. He\r\ncould hardly wait till the canal was beneath them, till the time came\r\nto guide the boat down to the argent sward that bordered the farther\r\nbank. He stepped lightly down to the soft turf and lifted Thejah Doris\r\ndown beside him. He answered her questioning eyes: "A swim will refresh\r\nus, my princess. It will sharpen our senses and re-double our chances\r\nof eluding our persistent pursuers."\r\n\r\n"But I cannot swim, my chieftain."\r\n\r\nThe externals did not call for a leer at this point; nevertheless, he\r\nhad a hard time averting one. "Fear not, my princess," he said. "I,\r\nThon Carther, will instruct you."\r\n\r\nThey walked together to the bank and stood there hand in hand. Behind\r\nthem, Droola leaped from the deck and went romping up and down the\r\nesplanade. The nearer moon was high in the sky now, and the farther\r\nmoon was just beginning to show above the hills. "First," Thon-Smith\r\nsaid, "we must remove our accouterments. They will weigh us down in the\r\nwater and make movement well nigh impossible."\r\n\r\n"All of them, my chieftain?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, my princess, all of them."\r\n\r\nShe raised her hand to the gossamer thread that held her Martian\r\nequivalent of a halter in place. Abruptly the muffled thunder of padded\r\ntoat hooves sounded in the distance.\r\n\r\nHer hand dropped like a stone. "The Tarks!" she cried. "Oh, my\r\nchieftain, the mortal enemies of my people are close upon our heels!"\r\n\r\nHe choked back his disappointment. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
How could he have forgotten? He, the\r\nauthor, the creator! "Quickly," he said, seizing her arm. "Into the\r\natmosphere boat. The canal will not stop them!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy the time they gained the deck the foremost rank of the Tark horde\r\nhad reached the opposite bank. The green warriors did not pause for so\r\nmuch as a second, but goaded their mounts into the water. Once in the\r\ncanal, Tark and toat became as one, and the horde took on the aspect\r\nof a school of gigantic green porpoises, leaping in and out of the\r\nwater with incredible swiftness, reaching the other bank in a matter\r\nof minutes. But by then Thon-Smith and Thejah Doris were rising once\r\nagain into the night sky. The romping Droola discovered their departure\r\njust in time, and with a mighty leap managed to gain the after deck and\r\nscramble to safety.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the craft gained sufficient altitude Thon-Smith threw it\r\ninto fast-flight and aligned the prow with the canal bank. The cool\r\nnight air became a cold wind and the countryside blurred beneath them.\r\nHe maintained the speed till he was sure their pursuers could no\r\nlonger overtake them, then he cut down to slowflight and returned his\r\nattention to Thejah Doris.\r\n\r\nShe was lying on her side, gazing at him admiringly. Again he slipped\r\nhis arm beneath her shoulders, but he had no sooner done so when\r\nDroola, still shivering from the wind of fast-flight, bounded forward\r\nand snuggled between them.\r\n\r\nThe interruption was essential to the story\'s word count, but just the\r\nsame it was frustrating. Even Thejah Doris looked put out, though she\r\ndidn\'t say anything. Instead, she turned and reclined upon her back,\r\nhands clasped behind her head, and let the two moons vie with one\r\nanother to do justice to her charms. It was an interesting contest to\r\nwatch, and soon Thon-Smith became engrossed. He became so engrossed, in\r\nfact, that he failed to see the tower till it was too late.\r\n\r\nIt was a tall tower--remarkably tall when you considered the altitude\r\nof the atmosphere boat. He yanked the tiller savagely, but their\r\nmomentum was too great, and a moment later the bow crumpled against\r\nstone. The deck tilted abruptly, and he barely managed to grab Thejah\r\nDoris before she tumbled over the low rail, and it was all he could do\r\nto maintain his balance till the rapidly sinking craft came opposite\r\nthe dark aperture of a window. He leaped lightly to the sill, his\r\nMartian princess in his arms, and stepped into the musty gloom of a\r\nlofty chamber.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe faithful Droola was not so fortunate. It essayed the leap, but\r\nmissed the sill by a good two feet. (He\'d been planning on getting rid\r\nof Droola for a long time.) Dutifully he listened for the sound of the\r\nfaithful body striking the ground, but when, an appropriate time later,\r\nthe sound came, he could not summon the emotional response which the\r\nplot called for. All he could manage was a sort of vague contrition\r\nwhich was immediately negated by the realization that at last he and\r\nThejah Doris were really alone.\r\n\r\nShe had discovered tapers on the dusty shelves that lined one wall of\r\nthe chamber, and now she lit three of them and set them upon the rough\r\nwooden table that stood in the middle of the stone floor. "There is\r\nnothing to fear, my chieftain," she said. "This is one of the deserted\r\nlocktowers once maintained by the ancient Mii when Mars was young\r\nand great barges plied her blue canals. Above us is the control room\r\nitself, from which the mighty locks, now rusted and fallen to ruin,\r\nwere manipulated by the ancient Miian tenders. Now the towers stand\r\nsilent and forlorn, the havens of occasional wandering bards who find\r\nthe lofty rooms and empty echoing stairways conducive to their search\r\nfor the ever-elusive Muse."\r\n\r\nHe stared at her. It was, he had to admit, rather incongruous\r\nphraseology to be issuing from the lips of a blonde who, for all her\r\nroyal blood, still looked more like a burlesque queen than she did a\r\nprincess. Well, no matter. "You look lovely by candlelight," he said.\r\n\r\n"You are very gallant, my chieftain."\r\n\r\nShe lit another candle and went over and placed it in a wall niche\r\nbeside an ancient sleeping couch. She turned and faced him. "At last we\r\nare alone."\r\n\r\nHe started toward her, arms outstretched. Simultaneously the thunder of\r\npadded toat hooves sounded in the distance.\r\n\r\n"The Tarks!" Thejah Doris cried, eluding him and running to the window.\r\n"They\'ve seen our light! Oh, my chieftain, the mortal enemies of my\r\npeople threaten us once again!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, for Pete\'s sake!" Thon-Smith said, throwing up his hands. "No\r\nwonder my stories get bounced!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nResignedly he went over and joined her at the window. Sure enough, the\r\nTark horde was back in the running again. Wearily he explored his mind\r\nfor the next sequence. All he could find were the words, END OF PART\r\nONE. That was when he remembered that he\'d been trying his hand at a\r\nserial and had neglected to plot it beyond the first installment.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my chieftain, what are we going to do?"\r\n\r\nHe did not answer. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
He was thinking--thinking furiously. If a writer\r\ncould write himself so completely into a story that he became\r\nphysically involved in it, was there any reason why he couldn\'t\r\nextricate himself by writing a factual account of his real life?\r\n\r\nIt was worth a try. The alternative was to plot Installment Two, and\r\nsomehow he didn\'t feel quite up to it. Installment One had been rather\r\nan enervating experience.\r\n\r\nAbruptly another thought struck him: _Why a factual account?_\r\n\r\nHe remembered his dingy little apartment, his dilapidated typewriter,\r\nhis collection of rejection slips, his nagging, flat-chested\r\nwife--Suddenly he looked at Thejah Doris standing beside him with\r\nheaving breast, anxiously watching the relentless approach of the Tarks.\r\n\r\nWhy a factual account indeed!\r\n\r\nHe concentrated. When he had the plot firmly fixed in his mind he\r\nsat down at the table to write. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
A momentary crises arose. There was\r\nno paper, no pen, not even a pencil. Then he remembered what Thejah\r\nDoris had said about the wandering bards, and he began searching for a\r\ndrawer. Even Martian poets needed something to write on. Presently he\r\nfound one and pulled it out. Sure enough, it contained several sheets\r\nof parchment-like paper, a long quill pen and a small vial of black\r\nfluid.\r\n\r\nThe thunder of padded toat hooves was growing louder by the minute.\r\n"Oh, my chieftain, what are we going to do!" Thejah Doris cried again.\r\n\r\n"We\'re going to swap serials," Thon-Smith said, and began to write.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was a fine bright morning. Harold Worthington Smith awoke late and\r\nlay for a while watching the robins flitting among the branches of\r\nthe box elder outside his bedroom window. Then he got up and slipped\r\nleisurely into his lounging robe. Yawning, he stepped across the hall\r\nto his study. Below him in the kitchen his wife was humming happily,\r\nand he could smell coffee perking, wheatcakes frying and sausage\r\nsizzling.\r\n\r\nHe entered his study and walked over to the desk. He sat down. There\r\nwere three long thin letters lying beside his solid gold typewriter\r\nwhere his wife had placed them. He opened them nonchalantly. The\r\nfirst one was from _The Edgar Rice Burroughs Reader_ and contained a\r\ncheck for $750.00, the second was from _Dead-Sea Bottom Stories_ and\r\ncontained a check for $2500.00, and the third was from _Red Planet\r\nStories_ and contained a check for $5000.00.\r\n\r\nThe phone rang. He picked it up.

"HWS speaking.

=== Chunk 9 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Good morning, sir. This is Parker, of _Mammalian Blonde Stories_.\r\nRegarding that last piece you were kind enough to let us have a look\r\nat, would $10,000.00 be--"\r\n\r\n"Sorry," Harold Worthington Smith said, "I never discuss business\r\nmatters before breakfast. Call me back later."\r\n\r\n_Click._\r\n\r\n"Harold," his wife called from the foot of the stairs, "there\'s an\r\neditor outside."\r\n\r\n"Another one?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. Shall I let him in?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose so. Tell him I\'ll try to give him a minute while I\'m having\r\nmy coffee."\r\n\r\nHe stacked the checks neatly and placed them on the large pile of\r\nchecks to the right of the gold typewriter. He made a mental note to\r\ntry to make the bank today. Checks were a nuisance when you let too\r\nmany of them accumulate. He threw the three long thin envelopes into\r\nthe wastebasket marked "Long Thin Envelopes." It was full again, he\r\nnoticed. He could have sworn he\'d just emptied it a day or two ago.\r\n\r\nHis wife came running up the stairs. "Harold, two more editors just\r\ndrove up! Shall I let them in, too?"\r\n\r\n"You might as well," Harold Worthington Smith said. "If you don\'t,\r\nthey\'ll just hang around the door all day and make a nuisance of\r\nthemselves." He looked at her critically. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
She\'d come through remarkably\r\nwell. If anything she was even better stacked than she\'d been before.\r\n"Tell them I\'ll be down presently, princess. And put some clothes on.\r\nFor now," he added.\r\n\r\nAfter she had gone he looked the study over carefully. When he was sure\r\nthat no traces of his previous reality were present he descended slowly\r\nand majestically to the hall where the three editors humbly awaited him.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
