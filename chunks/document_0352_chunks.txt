=== Chunk 2 ===
]\r\n\r\n\r\nYoung Ron Crag fused the edge of his claim tag to the metal vein in\r\nthe quartzite rock with his heat gun, then with heavy-shod fingers he\r\ntugged at the small copper disk, but it remained firmly in place.\r\n\r\n"That makes you owner according to law, Mr. Crag," he murmured. In the\r\nlonely, rugged reaches of Luna\'s north country a man had to talk to\r\nsomeone. "A real lode looks like. Richest uranium lode I\'ve seen in\r\nmany a Lunar June. Bring me a nice roll if some of those rotten claim\r\njumpers don\'t--"\r\n\r\nAutomatically he grasped the hilt of his gun, loosening it in the\r\nholster. He sauntered toward the catatread, parked near the southern\r\nrim of the small crater, near the mouth of the gorge.\r\n\r\nHe could see several purple, nebulous space moths fluttering around the\r\nengine of his vehicle. Crag watched them as he approached the machine;\r\nthey dipped, fluttered and weaved about the catatread, many of them\r\nwrapping themselves about the warm metal of the engine and eagerly\r\nabsorbing any heat present. They reminded Ron Crag more of translucent\r\namoeba wreathing through the nothingness of space than moths, but some\r\nancient had dubbed them moths and moths they had remained.\r\n\r\nThey ranged in size from the area of a man\'s hand to about three square\r\nfeet. He knew two things about them; they could detect the slightest\r\nrise in temperature over a distance of fifty yards, and they did not\r\nlike the intense, constant heat of the two-weeks lunar days. They\r\napparently disappeared into craters and fissures during the hotter part\r\nof the day, and came out after the setting of the sun.\r\n\r\n"Good thing my suit and thermocubes are completely insulated," he\r\nmuttered, "or there\'d probably be about ten thousand of them wrapped\r\naround me, drinking up the heat."\r\n\r\nHe dropped his hands to the two metal blocks built on to the suit high\r\non each hip. Those two mechanisms were almost as important as his\r\noxygen tank. They generated the heat conducted to the material of the\r\nsuit and protected him from the 153\xc2\xb0 C of the lunar nights. Of course,\r\nhe could last awhile with only one of the units functioning. A man\r\ngot into the habit of checking them during the long nights; his life\r\ndepended on them--them and the oxygen tank, and sometimes the gun.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe pale, turquoise disk of Earth rode low in the heavens above the\r\nserrated Alps, towering above him, illuminating the rugged fastnesses\r\nin a sort of aqua glow. Earth, now at full, lighted Luna many times\r\nbrighter than a full moon had ever lighted her. But the countless\r\nthousands of shadows cast by lava stalagmites, spires, boulders and\r\nmountain peaks were pits of nothingness. Crag walked into the Stygian\r\nblackness cast by a stalagmite and disappeared as completely as though\r\nswallowed up by a dark hole in the moon\'s surface. He passed on through\r\nthe shadow and reappeared abruptly on the other side. He himself cast\r\na long, black shadow, more weird because it appeared to be a black pit\r\nsliding over the floor of the crater.\r\n\r\nInstinctively Ron Crag crouched as the pencil of flame streaked past\r\nhis head. He could not feel the heat through the insulated suit, but he\r\nknew it had missed him by scant inches. He wheeled and darted back into\r\nthe shadow he had just quitted, his gun leaping into his hand.\r\n\r\nHe saw a burly form dart into the shadow of a massive boulder across\r\nthe basin from him. He started to snap a beam at it, but held his\r\nfire; the flare would only betray his own position. He could not see\r\nthe slightest shape, the slightest trace of movement in the inky\r\nblackness of the other shadow. There was some compensation in knowing\r\nthat the ambusher could not see him either. Without air to diffuse the\r\nearthlight, the shadows were sharp and distinct as though no light\r\nexisted in all the universe outside their borders.\r\n\r\nHe glanced in the direction from which his attacker had come. There\r\nin the north edge of the crater, in the mouth of the canyon, another\r\ncatatread was parked. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
It was an old model, battered and eroded by time\r\nand hard usage. Ron Crag thought he recognized the steed; he had seen\r\nit once or twice down south, in the parking area back of the Tycho\r\nterradome. Realizing the identity of his assailant a sudden terror\r\nparalyzed him for a moment, but then it fled, leaving him trembling and\r\nangry.\r\n\r\n"Howdy, son," a sarcastic voice drawled into the earphones of his\r\nradarphone. "You shouldn\'t talk to yo\'self about your rich lodes, else\r\nyou should be sure your radarphone is cut off, so\'s pore luckless\r\ncritters like me couldn\'t overhear ye."\r\n\r\nCrag bit his lip in anger and shame. The killer had heard his remark,\r\ngot a directional fix on his position and--\r\n\r\n"Joe Braun?" Crag grated into the transmitter in his helmet, forcing\r\nthe quaver out of his voice. "Biggest, dirtiest claim jumper in all\r\nNorth Luna."\r\n\r\n"Nobody ever proved a thing on me," Joe Braun guffawed.\r\n\r\n"No! Or you\'d be at the bottom of some crater," Crag retorted. "This\r\ntime you\'ve slipped."\r\n\r\n"Think so, feller? Think you\'ll be reportin\' this?

=== Chunk 4 ===
"\r\n\r\nRon\'s flesh crept. There were few men on Luna who would match flame\r\nwith this black-bearded killer. Those luckless ones who had challenged\r\nhim were now piled at the bottom of various craters.\r\n\r\nCrag stared at the black shadow protecting his adversary, gripping his\r\ngun. But he knew there would be nothing to shoot at unless Braun shot\r\nfirst, revealing his position. And Joe was no fool even when he faced\r\na greenhorn from Earth. Crag was at bay here in the concealing shadow,\r\nhelpless, trapped, and calling for help was out of the question. The\r\nradarphone would not carry to the nearest terradome.\r\n\r\nThe catatread! If he could make a dash for the catatread, reach it\r\nand throw a light beam into the shadows he could burn the other to\r\na crisp with the large, swivel gun. But then a wave of despondency\r\nblacked out his thoughts. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
It was too far to the vehicle. Even with the\r\nlighter gravity of Luna to hold him back, his space suit was heavy and\r\ncumbersome, and he could never make it before Joe Braun would throw at\r\nleast three shots in him. He would be a clay pigeon.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he realized the hopelessness of his predicament. He could\r\nnever match flame with Joe Braun. Ron Crag knew he did not have a\r\nchance in an open duel with the ruthless killer.\r\n\r\n"What\'sa matter, son, afraid?" came the taunt through his headset.\r\n\r\n"I guess you know what the penalty is for claim jumping?" Crag snapped.\r\n"To say nothing of attempted murder?"\r\n\r\n"Shore I do," Joe Braun laughed. "A great big posse\'ll hunt me down and\r\ntoss me into a bottomless crater. That\'s what happens to claim jumpers\r\nas gets caught. And you\'ll get a big, fat reward, huh, sonny?"\r\n\r\nRon bit back his answer.\r\n\r\n"But you named one o\' the charges wrong, son," chided Joe gently. "You\r\ncalled it _attempted_ murder." He chuckled. "That\'s one thing ol\' Joe\r\nBraun ain\'t ever gonna be guilty of. Whyn\'t ya come outa that shadder\r\nan\' get it over with?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCrag did not answer. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
He looked toward the catatread. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
There was not a\r\nsingle rock or spire between it and him to protect him. The cliffs of\r\nthe Alps rose sheer and precipitous from the level of the crater floor,\r\nand for most of the distance to the vehicle the very base of the cliffs\r\nwas brightly illuminated in the earthlight. But here and there a black\r\nshadow did jut out from the base of the precipice, cast by jagged\r\npeaks, eight thousand feet above the tiny basin. Those shadows formed\r\nan irregular chain of black splotches over the pumice-covered floor\r\nbetween Crag and the catatread.\r\n\r\nCrag wasted no time weighing his chances. Blood beat fiercely in his\r\ntemples as he tensed. He darted out into the earthlight, then retreated\r\nback into the same shadow as a livid ribbon of flame streaked by just\r\nin front of his visorport. He knew it was excellent shooting for a\r\nhand-gun at that range. It would take Joe Braun ten seconds to recharge\r\nand readjust the gun, and in that time--\r\n\r\nRon Crag darted out into the earthlight again, and fled for the nearest\r\nshadow a hundred feet away. He ducked into the blackness only split\r\nseconds ahead of another bolt of flame. If Braun only nicked his suit,\r\nhis oxygen tank, or his thermocubes it would finish him, and the gunman\r\nwas getting his range.\r\n\r\nJoe Braun was out in the light now, dashing for the shadow of a spire\r\nnearer Crag\'s catatread. Ron Crag raised his gun and pressed the trip;\r\na bolt of flame cleaved space just behind the hurtling shape.\r\n\r\nA disappointed oath ricocheted about the close walls of Crag\'s helmet.\r\nHe quickly pressed the charge poles of the gun against the battery\r\nposts in his accessory belt and recharged the gun. He then turned the\r\nrange dial to seventy-five yards, leaving the bolt diameter at one\r\ninch. He crouched in the shadow, peering across the intervening area\r\nbetween himself and his assailant.\r\n\r\n"Missed, son!" Joe Braun guffawed. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
"Want to make it to your catatread,\r\neh? Well, two can play the same game.

=== Chunk 9 ===
"\r\n\r\nCrag swallowed an angry retort. Despair was again rising in him like a\r\ndense fog.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJoe Braun darted for another shadow, drawing ever closer to Crag\'s\r\nvehicle. Crag took careful aim, but his hand wavered ever so slightly.\r\nHe fired. A streak of flame reached out and nicked--no, it passed just\r\nto the rear of the fleeing man, a little above hip level. He could have\r\nsworn the bolt grazed the man\'s accessory belt, but no apparent damage\r\nwas done. The huge man kept running and ducked into another shadow\r\nnearer the catatread. If Joe Braun made it safely to the machine he\r\ncould turn the young prospector\'s gun on its owner and burn him down\r\nwithout effort.\r\n\r\nThe next shadow in the chain was only twenty yards away. Crag covered\r\nthe distance in three strides. Another bolt blasted space between his\r\nhead and right shoulder. He snapped a bolt back in retaliation. It cut\r\nhigh and to the left.\r\n\r\nCrag glanced frantically at the catatread. It was still too far away\r\nto reach in one dash. He knew he could never make it unless he hugged\r\nthe shadows as he had been doing. Several space moths still clung\r\nhungrily to the cooling engine of the machine, but many of them were\r\nflopping and writhing frantically in space above the machine. They had\r\ndetected the violent heat from the flame guns in the instant before\r\ntheir heat was dissipated into space, but that split second was not\r\nlong enough for the creatures to locate the origin of the heat. They\r\nseemed frustrated, flopping desperately about in confused circles. Some\r\nof them fluttered into the shadows of the rocks and spires in their\r\nsearch, and their vaguely radiant network of veins squirmed like purple\r\nwraiths in the Stygian blackness.\r\n\r\nCrag\'s attention was suddenly yanked back to his predicament, when Joe\r\nBraun darted for another shadow. Crag snapped another bolt and missed\r\nagain. Either the bandit had plenty of guts or he knew Ron Crag was\r\nreally a poor shot. He did not hesitate in his advance from shadow to\r\nshadow toward the catatread. It was a duel to the death, here in the\r\nshadows.\r\n\r\nRon Crag dashed to the next shadow without drawing flame. Apparently\r\nJoe deliberately held his fire, for the lighted area between this one\r\nand the next shadow was much further than Crag could sprint even in ten\r\nseconds. And beyond the next one lay the catatread. He crouched against\r\nthe rock cliffs, glancing first toward the vehicle, then back at the\r\nblack blot that he knew concealed the killer.\r\n\r\nThere were only three more spires between Joe Braun and the catatread,\r\nthree more shadows, three more short sprints. Once the claim jumper\r\nmade the machine Ron Crag knew the duel was over anyway. Maybe his\r\nbest chance was to wait here, aim carefully and take a chance on a\r\nlucky hit. But if he missed Braun in the first sprint the man could\r\nmake it all the way to the spire nearest the machine before Crag could\r\nrecharge. And if he reached that last spire....\r\n\r\nPerhaps he\'d better run for it, after all, Crag thought desperately.\r\nBut he knew with a cold certainty the sure aim of the gunman could not\r\nmiss him in the long sprint. Perhaps if he shot in Joe\'s direction just\r\nafter he broke into the earthlight it might divert the killer\'s aim\r\nenough for a miss. He decided abruptly that it was his only chance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith trembling fingers he checked the range dials on the gun. His\r\ntongue clung to the roof of a dry mouth. Crag crouched, darted\r\nforward--then halted so abruptly on the very rim of the shadow that he\r\nfell backwards and landed gently on both elbows.\r\n\r\nSlowly he got to his feet, his eyes narrowed thoughtfully. Several\r\nspace moths were weaving through space toward the shadow of the\r\npinnacle concealing the bandit. Crag stared, breathing more evenly now.\r\nMore and more of the nebulous creatures were rising above the catatread\r\nand moving straight as a plumb line in the wake of the leading moths.\r\n\r\nHe stared at the inky shadows where he knew the killer lurked. The\r\nfirst two or three moths had already reached their destination. He\r\ncould see their pulsating, irradiant veins curled around some object\r\nthat had attracted them. More and more of the creatures floated into\r\nthe shadow, disappeared for a moment, and then reappeared for a\r\nmoment, and then reappeared as a vague glow, fluttering toward the mass\r\ntheir companions had already formed.\r\n\r\nRon Crag watched. The killer was apparently oblivious to their\r\npresence. Ron wet dry lips with his tongue, while his fingers slowly\r\nreset the dials on the gun. Range: sixty yards! Diameter of beam: four\r\ninches! Slowly he raised the gun and took careful aim, eight inches to\r\nthe right, eighteen inches above the radiant cluster of space moths. If\r\nhe was wrong, if he.... It was a gamble and if he was shooting at the\r\nwrong space Joe Braun would get him with the flare of Ron\'s gun. Even\r\nif he only wounded him, the other would get him.\r\n\r\n"Worried, feller--" the harsh voice began.\r\n\r\nA coruscating tube of flame leaped at the shadow across the canyon;\r\nfor a moment it illuminated the area around the bandit in a brilliant\r\nglare. His taunting voice broke off with an agonized gasp. In the\r\nbrief flash Ron Crag saw the man twist erect, his empty hands grasping\r\nheavenward. He took three halting steps and tumbled into full view in\r\nthe earthlight. A great, charred hole was burned completely through his\r\nchest, and already the space moths were shifting to the wound, eagerly\r\nabsorbing the escaping heat from the suit, and from Joe Braun\'s body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _In the brief flash Ron Crag saw the man twist erect._]\r\n\r\nRon Crag slowly approached the crumpled form, gun ready. One glance\r\nat the sightless eyes, the bearded face and open mouth behind the\r\nvisorport was all he needed to confirm what he already knew. Joe Braun\r\nhad jumped his last uranium claim; Joe Braun had pulled his last gun.\r\n\r\nHe leaned over the body, examining it closely. His gamble had panned\r\nout. One corner of the thermocube on Braun\'s right hip was fused and\r\na pinpoint hole was evident. The heat bolt Crag thought struck the\r\nkiller\'s accessory belt had not missed after all.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be a fork-tailed comet!" Ron Crag breathed. He glanced\r\naffectionately at the squirming, purple creatures. "Thanks, friends,"\r\nhe murmured.\r\n\r\nThen he set out on shaking legs for the catatread.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
