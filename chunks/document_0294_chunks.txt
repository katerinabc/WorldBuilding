GORDON\r\n\r\n[Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from Comet March 41.\r\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright\r\non this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    "_A phantom land and a phantom folk\r\n    Come sailing out of the deep unknown\r\n    With a soundless roar and a lightless flash\r\n    To conquer a void for them alone._"\r\n\r\n    --ROGER DAINTETH\r\n\r\n"Planet sighted!" sang out Kendall, eye glued to the electro-telescope.\r\n\r\n"Where away?" rang Fred Broster from his place at the controls.\r\n\r\n"Five point on ten left from star. Point three seven above the\r\nelliptic," came Kendall\'s voice again from the forward observation\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n"You\'re daft and dreaming. Snap into it and look again," Broster\r\nyelled, staring hard at the automatically-recording space-chart.\r\n"There\'s nothing here but a particularly empty species of nothingness."\r\n\r\nThe captain\'s keen gray eyes stared carefully at the glowing panel\r\nbefore him. On it shone out tiny points of light which revealed each\r\nof the different bodies through whose vicinity the _Astralite_ was\r\npassing. A remarkable device actuated by delicate gravital detectors\r\nwhich marked out every body they approached.\r\n\r\nAnd according to this chart, there was no such planet recorded in the\r\ndepths of the device as that which Kendall had sighted.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not dreaming. Your chart is wrong if you can\'t find it there,"\r\nKendall remarked after a pause, still staring through the lens of the\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\nBroster examined the chart again. No; there positively was no planet\r\ncircling the star as his observer claimed.\r\n\r\n"Come away from there!" he called, straightening up. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
"Dr. Seaward, will\r\nyou please take the observer\'s place and check."\r\n\r\nSeaward dropped the calculations in hand, walked across the control\r\nroom of the great interstellar explorer, up to the very tip. Kendall\r\nstood aside while the doctor applied his eye to the lens.\r\n\r\n"It\'s there all right, Broster. A little red disk exactly where he\r\ncalled it off; the chart\'s wrong."\r\n\r\nBroster ran a hand through his chestnut hair, a puzzled look in his\r\neyes. He glared at the space-chart for a moment, as if loath to believe\r\nthat that faithful instrument could have gone haywire. Then he picked\r\nhis way over to the electro-telescope to verify the sighting personally.\r\n\r\nA moment later, the three were looking at each other wonderingly.\r\nAll realized what this might mean: if that space-chart failed them,\r\nit might be all over with any possibility ever of returning home.\r\nSpace-navigating in the bounds of the solar system was one thing; there\r\nit didn\'t matter whether you ran by chart or by observation. But here\r\nin the bounds of cosmic space, thousands of light-years from the sun,\r\nwhere they had to navigate in the blackness of interstellar distances,\r\nthe space-chart was all-important. Bodies out here were dark; there\r\nwere no stars nearby from which they could reflect light....\r\n\r\n"That chart will have to be overhauled," murmured the captain. "If it\'s\r\ngone wrong...."\r\n\r\n"What about this planet? It\'s the only one around this star," put in\r\nKendall, jerking a thumb in its general direction.\r\n\r\n"Head toward it; we may as well give it the once-over."\r\n\r\nThe huge ship pursued its unvarying course toward the approaching star.\r\nAt a single light-year away, they decelerated, slowed down. Riding the\r\nstrange eka-gravity waves, the little-known carrier-waves for light and\r\ngravity which seemed to travel as fast in relation to light as light\r\nin relation to sound, this craft of the Thirtieth Century was able to\r\naccomplish what had for centuries been believed unachievable.\r\n\r\nThey approached until at last the gravital drag clutched the ship,\r\nstarted to draw it in toward that vast, fiery globe spurting forth\r\ncountless tons of disintegrated matter per second, emanating energy\r\ninconceivable. Yet, withal, a small star, smaller than Sol and quite\r\ninconspicuous as stars go.\r\n\r\nAs they drifted, Broster and Seaward examined the space-chart\r\nthoroughly. But in vain; nothing could be found out of order: no\r\nshort circuits, no tubes needing replacement. It was in perfect shape,\r\nbut ... it refused to light a white speck in its black field for the\r\nnear planet.\r\n\r\nThey watched the planet grow larger, slowly made out surface details.\r\nA ruddy world, bathed entirely in red light, although the star around\r\nwhich it circled was white. Crimson clouds floated in masses of carmine\r\nseas and necine land-masses. The glow of the red world shone in\r\nthrough the stella-quartzite ports, throwing a weird, bloody glare on\r\neverything.\r\n\r\n"This is a helluva world," growled Kendall. "You\'d go nuts there after\r\nawhile.

=== Chunk 3 ===
"\r\n\r\nSeaward nodded. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
"Quite so. Red is a color that acts to irritate those\r\nwho look at it overlong. I wouldn\'t advise staying on this world for\r\nmore than a few minutes. We could easily go mad were we forced to\r\nremain here so much as a day.

=== Chunk 5 ===
"\r\n\r\n"We\'ll land, anyway, and look around. If--" Broster was cut off\r\nabruptly as the shrill scream of the alarm pierced his line of thought.\r\n"What the devil is that?"\r\n\r\nThe sound of running feet from the far back of the ship came to their\r\nears, then the fourth member of the crew streaked into the control\r\nroom. "Space-ships approaching us!" Arundell shouted. "Didn\'t you spot\r\nthem?"\r\n\r\nBroster wheeled around to the chart. Nothing indicated; according to\r\nit, there was no planet ahead of them, no space-ships behind them. He\r\nmuttered something then hurried across to the side ports, swung out the\r\nperiscopic plates, stared anxiously to their rear.\r\n\r\nThere were at least a dozen of the red bodies moving along in their\r\nwake. Large, all of them, and near. Ships almost as great as the\r\n_Astralite_, ships that looked dangerous.\r\n\r\n"They\'re close," he grated, "too damn close. I don\'t like it."\r\n\r\n"Neither did I. I was wondering why you didn\'t do something when I saw\r\nthem in the port," Arundell exclaimed.\r\n\r\nBroster jumped to the controls, pulled the lever that should shunt\r\nthe ship to one side. But as the nose turned away, and the great mass\r\nof her began slowly to describe a long arc in relation to her former\r\ncourse, another exclamation came from Kendall: "They\'re spreading out\r\nto stop us!"\r\n\r\nBroster cursed, reset the course. The planet was dead ahead now.\r\n\r\n"Trapped!" he fumed. "The red planet ahead of us, and those ships\r\nbehind us. What do they want?"\r\n\r\n"It might be well to stop," Dr. Seaward put in. "They may want to look\r\nus over and nothing more. Unless we arouse suspicion by resisting now."\r\n\r\n"And they might steal the ship under our noses, too," protested\r\nArundell.\r\n\r\nBroster shook his head. "There cannot be a question of letting unknown\r\nintelligences enter this craft or hold it. We can\'t afford to take\r\nchances, even if the notion that other world dwellers are necessarily\r\nenemies is silly. We\'ve got to assume that everything we see is\r\ndangerous until proven harmless or friendly. Those are our first\r\norders: do not surrender the ship."\r\n\r\n"Then we run for it?" asked Seaward.\r\n\r\n"We do. Our offensive weapons may be better than theirs but it\'s\r\nanother chance we\'re not taking. The very fact that we\'re outnumbered\r\nmakes retreat the order of the day."\r\n\r\n"Look there!" 

=== Chunk 6 ===
exclaimed Arundell. "They\'re beaming past us!"\r\n\r\nOne of the strange oval, multi-ported, oddly-ornamented, crimson craft\r\nhad just shot a red beam alongside of the _Astralite_. Not touching it,\r\nbut passing by, as if to show that, whenever they cared, this fleet\r\ncould annihilate the intruder. Then, all the other ships surrounding\r\nthem began to flash beams. Crossing and criss-crossing all about them\r\nsave in front.\r\n\r\n"Look," exclaimed Kendall. "You can see those beams as if they were in\r\nair."\r\n\r\n"Marvellous and impossible," groaned Seaward. "We\'ve run into a\r\nswarm of impossibilities today. Some philosopher once remarked that\r\nin eternity everything was possible--in fact, everything that could\r\npossibly happen has happened. It looks as if we\'re running into bits of\r\nthat now. I should have taken my daughter\'s advice and let a younger\r\nman come this trip."\r\n\r\n"It may be impossible, but it\'s so," broke in Broster. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
"And deadly.\r\nWe\'re getting out of here fast."\r\n\r\nHe turned to the controls and a moment later the _Astralite_ began to\r\naccelerate. There was a limit to the speed they could reach as they\r\nwould have to shunt again soon to keep from smashing against the red\r\nplanet. Unless--\r\n\r\n"Why not?" asked Arundell, following Broster\'s evident thoughts.\r\n\r\n"They apparently want us to land on the planet. So we do go for it,\r\nthen shunt aside at the last minute."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt first, it seemed as if the _Astralite_ would leave the others\r\nbehind, but it was soon apparent that the unknown ships could keep up\r\nwith her. In fact were closing in.\r\n\r\nThere was one pursuer behind them that seemed to Kendall, as he\r\nwatched through the lens, almost to be upon them. It was, he knew,\r\nsome half-mile away in reality. He could see the curiously pitted nose\r\nof the craft, note the weirdly-streamlined mass. He observed, with\r\nastonishment, a little piece of wire seemingly flying loose from a\r\nbearing on one of the strange ships, which was streaming off behind as\r\nif in a stiff breeze. Yet space about them was empty!\r\n\r\n"Look out!" called Seaward from the forward scope. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
"Here\'s more of\r\nthem."\r\n\r\nComing around the planet from behind, spreading out along the side as\r\nif to form a welcoming arch were more of the weird ships.\r\n\r\n"That ties it," exclaimed Broster. "We\'ll never be able to pass the\r\nplanet. It\'s either land or crash."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "_We\'ll never be able to pass the planet. It\'s either\r\nland or crash._"]\r\n\r\n"Then we crash," came the response.\r\n\r\n"Man the guns!" yelled Broster. "Let\'s see how many we can take with us\r\nbefore we go."\r\n\r\nThe three others swung in the various weapons and trained them on the\r\nsurrounding ships. Explosion-torpedo cannon, twin-rays for electric\r\njolting comprised the types of offensive guns. They were getting\r\nvery close to the planet, now. And it seemed as if the red ships\r\nwere expecting the _Astralite_ to slow down, for their beams shot\r\noccasionally in front of the earth-ship. The carmine bulk of the\r\nplanet loomed up over most of the view now. It was too late to shunt\r\naside.\r\n\r\n"Fire!"\r\n\r\nNo sound, no roar of explosions. They watched eagerly for results. But\r\nthere were none. Not a single torpedo appeared to have hit its mark,\r\nnot a single twin-ray seemed to bathe the surrounding ovoids. They\r\nfired again.\r\n\r\nKendall swore. The course of one torpedo was the stimulus; he watched\r\nit, saw its dark mass approach the nose of one of the vessels behind.\r\nThen he swears he saw it strike--and disappear.\r\n\r\nFiring was useless. These ships were invulnerable to their weapons.\r\n\r\nBroster looked up, bracing himself.\r\n\r\n"Stand by to crash!"\r\n\r\nThe four stopped everything, turned to look at each other for a moment\r\nin silence. In a few seconds more they would simply cease to exist. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
No\r\npain, no hours of lingering agony trapped in the wreckage. At the speed\r\nthey were going, the entire ship would be volatilized, would fuse into\r\na molten, glowing mass.\r\n\r\nThey turned again to the plates to look for a last time at the universe\r\naround them.\r\n\r\nFor six years they had traveled away from earth, far, far beyond any\r\npoint man had ever dreamed of reaching. They were almost to the point\r\nwhere the order to turn back would have been given. Much had been\r\nlearned; now it would be lost.\r\n\r\nBroster gave her full acceleration.\r\n\r\nThey saw the planet seemingly leap toward them, saw cloudbanks flick\r\npast them. A great flat plain of ruddy rock, a dread expanse of barren\r\ngranite. This in the veriest fragment of a second, then--\r\n\r\nA momentary shock, as if each man had received an electrical jolt; a\r\nsudden flash of intolerable red. Darkness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe earthmen blinked their eyes.\r\n\r\nThey were in the ship, unharmed. They stood at their posts in the same\r\nposition as before. And about them the black of far space and the\r\nshining points of the star-studded Milky Way.\r\n\r\nKendall gazed into the lens of the rear port, beckoned to the others.\r\nThe red planet was already a small, crimson disk behind them, passing\r\ninto oblivion as they accelerated onward, outward.\r\n\r\nBroster laughed. "It\'s all clear now. Why the space-chart seemingly did\r\nnot function, why our weapons were useless."\r\n\r\n"And why we were not killed, and why their beams could be seen in\r\nspace," added Seaward.\r\n\r\n"Because they weren\'t in space; they were in air. In the air of another\r\nuniverse."\r\n\r\n"It was all an illusion," explained Seaward. "The ships, the planet,\r\neverything. That is why none of these things registered on the space\r\nchart; there were no gravity waves emanating from them because they\r\nwere not there."\r\n\r\nBroster leaned back in his chair. "We\'ve all known that there are many\r\nuniverses beside ours, separated from us by the fourth-dimensional\r\nspace-time sheet. That was demonstrated by Marilus centuries ago.\r\nLaboratory experiments have produced images of other planets. All this\r\nwas just such an image.\r\n\r\n"The space-time envelope must have been a little warped at this point.\r\nEnough so as to let part of the waves emanating from the atoms of that\r\nsection to pass through to our universe--and permit waves emanating\r\nfrom the atoms of our universe to pass through to them. We were able\r\nto see the red rays of their spectrum, nothing else. They saw us as a\r\nviolet ship. But that was all."\r\n\r\n"Then," put in Kendall, "that\'s why they seemed to be shooting rays at\r\nus."\r\n\r\n"Right. We appeared to them, in their world, as suddenly as they\r\nappeared to us in space; it was a double mirage. At one end of the\r\nwarp, they and their planet suddenly appear in what the instruments\r\nshow to be empty space; at the other end, we appear out of nowhere, a\r\nstrange ship headed for their planet. And, it must have seemed to them,\r\nthat we went right through their planet, too. That planet of theirs, by\r\nthe way, must be a tremendous one. Many times the mass and density of\r\nJupiter. It\'s probably what causes the space-warp."\r\n\r\n"What!" exclaimed Kendall. "You mean that thing\'s a permanent\r\ninstitution in space?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly."\r\n\r\n"Then let\'s go back and have a good look."\r\n\r\n"Check," agreed Broster.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll give their fleet and their planet the jitters again," laughed\r\nSeaward as he prepared the plates for special photos.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
