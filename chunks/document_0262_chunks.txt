]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Security Council was in emergency session. The four delegates would\r\nhave had easier consciences had more nations been represented, but it\r\nwas hard to travel now. Only Russia, England and France were able to\r\nsend their men to New York.\r\n\r\nSergei Moskov, USSR, presided unofficially. He wore a harried look, and\r\naddressed them wearily.\r\n\r\n"To think, gentlemen, that it has taken circumstances like these to\r\nbring us into accord!"\r\n\r\nThe others said nothing. Overhead, above New York\'s stone and glass UN\r\nbuilding that had been conceived in hope and wrought with faith, they\r\ncould hear the whine of the patrolling ships. The delegates stared at\r\nthe table in front of them.\r\n\r\n"Your country, Mr. Conrad," Moskov said to the American\r\nrepresentative, "is the mother of our last hope." He looked around the\r\ntable for concurrence. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Sir Manly straightened a bit, and M. Tourneau\'s\r\nmustache twitched, but they all nodded. What use national pride now?\r\nThere was not much time, anyway. Tonight....\r\n\r\n"He will be here?" Moskov asked.\r\n\r\nConrad cleared his throat. He reached into his coat pocket and pulled\r\nout a slip of paper.\r\n\r\n"Joe--I mean, Dr. Waters--sent an answer to our request." He read:\r\n\r\n    "\'I take my vorpal sword in hand. Beware, Jabberwock--I come. Joe\r\n    Waters.\'"\r\n\r\n"The courage of youth," Sir Manly said, but he smiled.\r\n\r\nMoskov looked at his watch. "He should be here, then."\r\n\r\n"I am."\r\n\r\nThey all turned at the sound of that voice, and rose as Joe Waters\r\nstrode in. Just thirty years old, athletic, brilliant. He was\r\naccompanied by a wizened character in a baggy brown suit and crumpled\r\nfelt hat.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen." Joe said, and bowed. They all sat down.\r\n\r\n"A friend," he explained, indicating his companion. "Name of Mike."\r\n\r\n"Friend _and_ buddy," Mike said in a whiskey-hoarse voice.\r\n\r\n"We thought you understood, Dr. Waters," Moskov said, eyeing Mike\r\ndistastefully, "that this was to be a secret conference."\r\n\r\nM. Tourneau, who had a sensitive nose, shifted his chair slightly away\r\nfrom the bum.\r\n\r\nJoe said, "I met Mike in a bar last night and he\'s been with me since.\r\nI like his unsophisticated point of view."\r\n\r\n"Bar!" Sir Manly exclaimed, visibly shaken.\r\n\r\n"Bar." Joe answered. "For the same reason I\'m here now." He leaned\r\nforward.\r\n\r\n"I happened to be looking at the moon with my girl when they blew it\r\nup." His eyes narrowed at the memory. "She started to cry, and was\r\nstill at it when we got back to her apartment. That\'s when I went to\r\na bar to get drunk. It\'s also one reason I\'m here. When they take the\r\nmoon away from lovers, it\'s the last straw!"\r\n\r\n"Give \'em hell, kid!" Mike rasped. Joe silenced him with a wave of his\r\nhand, and Mike slouched down in his chair looking hurt.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Conrad," Moskov said, "will you be good enough to give Dr. Waters\r\nthe latest developments?

"\r\n\r\n"All right. Joe, you know what\'s happened this past week."\r\n\r\nJoe nodded.\r\n\r\n"In case you didn\'t get the overall picture--their ships," he jerked\r\na thumb at the whine passing back and forth above, "have completely\r\nblanketed the world. They have destroyed every means of defense we\'ve\r\nused against them. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Atomic anti-aircraft, even, hasn\'t fazed them in the\r\nleast.\r\n\r\n"Yesterday they sent for us. The head of their expedition told us who\r\nthey are, and it accounts, perhaps, for their anthropoidal appearance.\r\nThey are from Jupiter, so it\'s not inconceivable after all that similar\r\nforms of life should become dominant in the same solar system.\r\n\r\n"They are easily twice our size--and if ability to learn and speak\r\nfluently in a half hour, each of the three languages represented here\r\nmeans anything, they have a proportionate I.Q.\r\n\r\n"Their leader, Slan, says his title means he is the crown prince\r\nof the royal Jovian family. Slan was nothing if not courteous and\r\nchivalrous. He told us yesterday he would give us a sporting chance for\r\nsurvival--why, I can\'t imagine. Apparently this expedition is like a\r\nglorified fox hunt to them.\r\n\r\n"We are to choose a person to represent the world in an intellectual\r\nduel with him. If we win, they withdraw completely, never to bother us\r\nagain. If we lose, then, he said, we\'re not worth saving and we\'ll be\r\ncompletely destroyed--hunted individually, which to them is great sport.\r\n\r\n"To prove they could do it, he had his ship\'s guns turn on the moon.\r\nYou saw what happened--disintegrated completely."\r\n\r\n"Them crumbs!" Mike grated. "We\'ll murder \'em, Joe!"\r\n\r\n"Quiet, Mike."\r\n\r\nMike grumbled, pulled out a cigarette paper and tobacco and rolled his\r\nown.\r\n\r\n"That\'s why we\'ve called on you," Conrad said.\r\n\r\n"Waters," Sir Manly said, "the world rests on your shoulders."\r\n\r\n"You have every qualification," M. Tourneau put in.\r\n\r\n"Your brilliant theories in symbolic logic and theoretical\r\nmathematics," said Sir Manly.\r\n\r\n"Chess champion of the world," Moskov added respectfully.\r\n\r\n"Your contributions to astrophysics," Conrad said.\r\n\r\n"And don\'t you guys ferget--he won the decathlon when he was just a\r\nhigh school kid. He\'ll murder them bums!

=== Chunk 6 ===
"\r\n\r\nJoe smiled. "Don\'t mind my pugnacious friend."\r\n\r\n"You are, so far as we know, the finest representative the world\r\ncould have." Moskov looked serious, and Joe became aware suddenly of\r\nthe awful burden involved. What use intellectual ability or athletic\r\nprowess, compared to Jovian standards? Wasn\'t there someone--even a\r\nscience-fiction writer, perhaps--better qualified to handle a situation\r\nas fantastic as this? Apparently not.\r\n\r\n"When\'s the funeral?" Joe asked drily.\r\n\r\n"Please, m\'sieu, a little respect for the situation!" M. Tourneau\r\nlooked pained.\r\n\r\n"The contest is to be in Slan\'s ship at eight o\'clock tonight," Moskov\r\nanswered. "They will pick you up here in five hours."\r\n\r\n"You and me both, Joe," Mike said.\r\n\r\n"Yeah," Joe answered, and now he was mentally reeling under the impact\r\nof his responsibility. "Let\'s have a drink first. I think we\'ll need\r\none.

=== Chunk 7 ===
"\r\n\r\nSir Manly paled. "I say...."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll murder them damn Greeks," Mike chortled.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Shay, I\'m not goin\' in that thing," Mike protested.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t fight \'em if we don\'t," Joe answered mournfully.\r\n\r\n"They\'re big enough, all right," Mike admitted respectfully. "Wouldn\'t\r\nsome football coach like to have one o\' _them_ on his squad!"\r\n\r\n"C\'mon, le\'s go." Joe shoved Mike toward the waiting ship, at the door\r\nof which a behemoth of a figure waited patiently, watching with some\r\napparent disdain as the two, arms around each other\'s shoulders, weaved\r\nunsteadily inside.\r\n\r\nInside the ship, Joe took a long pull at the bottle Mike passed him.\r\nStrange, he thought, how an unforseeable factor, upsetting life\'s\r\nroutine equations, produces unguessed mental reactions. Until last\r\nnight he\'d never had a drink in his life. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
Then a little thing like the\r\nmoon being blown up. Aloud he quoted,\r\n\r\n    "\'Yet what are all such mysteries to me\r\n    Whose life is full of indices and surds?\r\n    x^2 + 7x + 53 - 11/3\'"\r\n\r\n"Whassat?"\r\n\r\n"Lewish Carroll," Joe answered, and wondered greatly at the vast\r\namounts of liquor he had consumed in a short space of time.\r\n\r\n    "\'Beware the Jabberwock, my son....\'"\r\n\r\nAnd Joe Waters, the world\'s most brilliant human, passed out.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey left Joe in the ship and dragged Mike before Slan. That gigantic\r\nfigure sat in regal splendor at the end of a long corridor that ran the\r\nlength of the vessel. On either side of Mike, as he stumbled toward the\r\nthrone which seemed miles away, uniformed giants stood at attention.\r\nHad he stretched his arm he might have been able to rap a belt buckle.\r\nThe sensation of being a pygmy increased as he approached Slan.\r\n\r\nGrouped around Slan, whose throne was on a platform several feet\r\nhigh, stood members of what seemed to be a retinue. They sneered and\r\nsnickered as Mike drew near, and Mike had to strain his neck and\r\nblurred eyes to see them.\r\n\r\n"Are you ready to begin?" Slan asked in a voice that nearly deafened\r\nMike.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll murder ya, ya bums," Mike answered belligerently. His\r\nwhiskey-fogged mind somehow assumed Joe was still by his side.\r\n\r\n"Very well, then." And Slan extended an arm toward Mike, thumb pointed\r\nup.\r\n\r\nMike promptly repeated the gesture, except that he pointed _his_ thumb\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nSlan reached for a huge flagon of red liquid, which he poured slowly\r\nonto the floor. Mike stared, then reached into a hip pocket and\r\nproduced a bottle of whiskey, swallowed some and vigorously smacked his\r\nlips. Then he held the bottle out to Slan, grinning broadly.\r\n\r\nSlan reached into a bag at his side, took out a handful of colored\r\npebbles, and scattered them on the floor. Mike scrambled after them and\r\nstuffed them into his pocket, then struggled erect, panting with the\r\nexertion.\r\n\r\nSlan arose from his throne, stepped off the platform, and towered over\r\nMike.\r\n\r\n"You surprise me," he boomed. "You and your little planet are smarter\r\nthan I expected. Go, and tell your people that they could not have\r\nchosen a worthier representative."\r\n\r\nIt was a dazed and confused Mike who was led stumbling, and clutching\r\nhis bottle, back to the ship which was to take him to a free world.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSlan, meanwhile, found himself besieged by annoyed and puzzled\r\nfollowers. He held up his hand for silence, and relapsed into native\r\nJovian.\r\n\r\n"That earthling," he said sarcastically, "seems to have fared better\r\nthan you who are so proud of your intellects.\r\n\r\n"When I held my thumb up, indicating our superiority in size and\r\nstrength, he pointed his thumb down, to show that physical power is\r\nreally of minor importance.\r\n\r\n"I poured a red liquid onto the floor, dramatizing the effect of\r\nconflict on them, if that should be my wish. He demonstrated his\r\nfearlessness by producing a light-colored liquid and sampling it with\r\nenjoyment--as his kind would react to such an encounter.\r\n\r\n"Finally I flung out a handful of colored pebbles, displaying the\r\nconfusing array of languages, races, and ideas their world contains. He\r\nscooped them into his pocket, showing that their diversity could still\r\nbe united into single purpose."\r\n\r\nSlan looked contemptuously at the crestfallen faces of his men.\r\n\r\n"It would be to our benefit if we had half their spirit in proportion\r\nto our size," he said. Then he bellowed,\r\n\r\n"Order all ships to withdraw at once!" To an aide he muttered, "We\'ll\r\nleave this planet to those worthy of it."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMike and Joe were hiding from a world delirious with joy and anxious to\r\nheap glory upon its saviour--whom they thought was Joe Waters. Joe had\r\nno intention of deluding the world in this regard, but right now he was\r\nplying Mike with whiskey to get from him the story of what happened.\r\n\r\nThey were in the rear booth of a bar, and Mike kept insisting that Joe\r\nknew perfectly well what had happened because he\'d been right there.\r\n\r\n"All right," Joe said coaxingly, "I know what happened. But tell me how\r\nyou\'re going to tell it, so we can get our stories straight."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t understan\' it," Mike said thickly, shaking his head. "The guy\r\nwas nuts."\r\n\r\n"What happened?" Joe pleaded. Mike, who apparently had no saturation\r\npoint, gulped some more whiskey.\r\n\r\n"First thing," he said, "the guy sticks his thumb up in the air, like\r\nhe\'s gonna give me the bum\'s rush. So I point mine down--if he tries to\r\nkick me outa there before we even get a chance to talk business, I\'ll\r\nfloor \'im."\r\n\r\n"Yeah, you would."\r\n\r\nMike ignored this comment, took yet another drink and wiped his lips on\r\nthe back of his hand. Joe watched this display of alcoholic immunity\r\nwith admiration, and Mike continued.\r\n\r\n"Then he takes a bottle of this awful-looking wine and pours it out on\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\n"No wonder they been raising such a rumpus, Joe. With nothing but that\r\nstuff to drink, I would too! So I pulled out my flask and took a swig,\r\nto show what we\'ve got, and I offer him some. You know something, Joe,"\r\nand Mike leaned forward earnestly, "when that guy saw the kind of stuff\r\nwe drink he got a new respect, \'cause he takes a handful of jewels and\r\nrolls \'em at me. Now, I don\'t look no gift horse in the teeth--I pocket\r\n\'em as fast as I get my hands on \'em. I got the rocks with me--here."\r\n\r\nHe pulled out the "pebbles" Slan had referred to--and jewels they were.\r\nFire shot from diamonds, rubies, emeralds, amethysts. Joe whistled.\r\n\r\n"We can use the money that stuff will bring."\r\n\r\n"Buy a liquor store?" Mike asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n"Finance the development and launching of an interplanetary expedition."\r\n\r\n"Ah, what the hell you want to do that for?"\r\n\r\n"They\'ve got eleven moons," Joe said grimly, "and all we want is one."\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
