When\r\nhe could see again, one who could only have been Aphrodite, Goddess of\r\nlove and beauty stood between him and the unconscious enemy. She was\r\ndressed as though for the bridal room, her Goddess body, breathtakingly\r\nbeautiful, revealed through the transparent robe she wore. She was\r\nattired for love, but held a short sword in her hand.\r\n\r\nAphrodite smiled at him in derision. "Now, then, Prince of Argos, would\r\nyou fight the Gods?" She advanced the sword, half mockingly.\r\n\r\nBut the Greek was mad with bloodlust, half crazed with his day\'s\r\nvictories; he snatched up his spear, muttering, "Pallas Athene aids\r\nme," and rushed her.\r\n\r\nHer eyes widened, fear flashing in them, and she began to rise from the\r\nground. The barbaric spear flashed out and ripped her arm; blood flowed\r\nand she dropped the sword, screaming.\r\n\r\nDiomed heard a voice call urgently, "Go back! Go back immediately to--"\r\nAnd the Goddess Aphrodite disappeared.\r\n\r\nHe whirled to face the newcomer and saw another God confronting him.\r\nThe extent of his action was beginning to be realized but Diomed had\r\ngone too far to turn back now; he charged his new opponent, shield held\r\nhigh and sword at the ready. The God lifted his hand, sending forth a\r\nbolt of power that brought the Greek to his knees.\r\n\r\nDiomed\'s eyes were filled with sudden fear and despair. "Phoebus\r\nApollo," he quavered.\r\n\r\nThe God was scornful. "Beware, Diomed," he said. "Do not think to fight\r\nwith Gods."\r\n\r\nThe Greek cowered before him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLater, in the invisible space ship, hovering five hundred feet above\r\nthe battle, Cajun faced her, his features impassive and his tone of\r\nvoice faultless. He was boiling with rage beneath his courtesy.\r\n\r\n"I will present your complaint to the Captain, but I would like to\r\nremind the Lady Jan that she has been warned repeatedly against\r\nappearing in the battle clothed as she is and without greater defenses.\r\nIt was fortunate I was able to appear as soon as I did. If you\'d been\r\ninjured seriously, I hesitate to say what repercussions would\'ve taken\r\nplace on the home planet.

"\r\n\r\nHer eyebrows went up. "Injured seriously! Just what do you mean by\r\nthat? Do you realize this horrible wound will probably take half the\r\nnight to heal? You saw that barbarian was insane, why didn\'t you come\r\nto my assistance sooner? You haven\'t heard the last of this, you\r\ninefficient nincompoop. When we return home I\'ll have you stripped of\r\nyour rank!"\r\n\r\nCajun\'s face remained blank. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
"Yes, your ladyship," he said. "And,\r\nbefore I go, may I deliver a message from the Lady Marid? She said they\r\nawait you in the salon."\r\n\r\nShe drew a cape about her and without speaking further, swept from the\r\ncompartment.\r\n\r\nA muscle twitched in his cheek. "Parasites," he muttered savagely,\r\nand turned to go to his own quarters where he could change from this\r\nridiculous glittering armor, into his own uniform as ship\'s officer.\r\n\r\nThe Lady Jan stormed into the salon where the others had gathered to\r\ntry the new concoction the steward had named ambrosia. Some of them\r\nstill wore their costumes, others had changed into the more comfortable\r\ndress of their own world.\r\n\r\nHer eyes blazed at them. "Who in the name of Makred told that Greek he\r\nwould conquer anyone he fought today, even a God? The damned barbarian\r\nnearly killed me!"\r\n\r\nThe Lord Daren laughed gently. "It was Marid; she was playing the\r\nGoddess Athene. The sport was rather poor with that new bow of hers so\r\nshe thought she\'d inflame one of the Greeks and see just how berserk he\r\nwould become if he thought he had the protection of a Goddess."\r\n\r\n"He could have killed me!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, come, now, Jan, you were barely scratched. Besides, Marid didn\'t\r\nknow this Greek, Diomed, was going to run into you, or that he\'d have\r\nthe fantastic nerve to attack whom he thought one of his Gods."\r\n\r\nShe took up a goblet of the new drink, but she wasn\'t placated, "I\'m of\r\nthe opinion this stop shouldn\'t be made; it\'s too dangerous. I\'m going\r\nto insist Captain Foren blast the city and obliterate both sides of\r\nthis barbaric conflict."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Lady Marid, who was still dressed in her Pallas Athene armor, broke\r\nin. "Don\'t be so upset, Jan. We\'re sorry that brute hurt your arm,\r\nbut what can you expect on this type of cruise? They guaranteed us\r\nthrills, didn\'t they? 

=== Chunk 5 ===
The very dangers we face are what we\'re paying\r\nso highly for." She laughed lightly. "Besides, that costume you wear\r\nas Aphrodite. Really! I don\'t know why you didn\'t get worse than a\r\nscratch on the arm. These Greeks aren\'t exactly civilized--nor exactly\r\ncold-blooded, either."\r\n\r\nThe other\'s face went red and she snatched another of the drinks from\r\na tray. "Nevertheless, I\'m going to complain. This war is absolutely\r\ntoo perilous to be part of the tour. And after all the trouble we went\r\nto in order to learn their fantastic languages and customs. Why I was\r\nunder that damned Psycho-Study Impressor for nearly two hours!"\r\n\r\nCaptain Foren had entered behind her. "I agree with you Lady Jan, and\r\ncan only apologize. I should\'ve realized last week when Lord General\r\nBaris, fighting in the battle as the God Ares on the Trojan side, was\r\nspeared by this same Greek. The company would never hear the end of it,\r\nif, on one of these cruises, a passenger was seriously injured."\r\n\r\nThe Lord General Baris shrugged. "It was wonderful sport. I killed a\r\nscore of the beggars that day. I don\'t know how that one found a chink\r\nin my armor. I\'ll take measures against my costumer when we return\r\nhome." 

=== Chunk 6 ===
He grinned wryly. "I doubt if the Emperor would appreciate\r\nhaving one of his generals killed in a primitive war, while on leave."\r\n\r\n"I think I\'ll have to take a crack at this Diomed, myself," Lord Doren\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nThe Lady Marid laughed. "If I know you, you\'ll do it with a blaster\r\nfrom a hundred feet in the air above him."\r\n\r\nDoren smiled in return. "Of course. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Do you think. I\'d make a fool of\r\nmyself by going down into their battle as Baris does? It\'s insane. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
This\r\nhand to hand conflict is much too risky."\r\n\r\nThe Captain changed the subject. "I\'m sure you\'ll all appreciate our\r\nnext stop," he said. "I plan to visit an even more astounding planet\r\nthan this. We are to fight the swamp dragons of Venus."\r\n\r\n"From what distance, Captain?" Lord Doren drawled.\r\n\r\nThe Captain smiled. "Their poisonous breath reaches half a mile, so it\r\nwill be necessary to use long distance weapons."\r\n\r\nLord General Baris scowled. "It sounds too easy. I like to fight\r\nhumanoids; there\'s more thrill in killing when your opponent looks like\r\nyourself, as do these earthlings."\r\n\r\nThe Lady Jan was nearing the nasty stage of intoxication. "It wouldn\'t\r\nbe so thrilling if you weren\'t provided with defenses making it\r\npractically impossible to be hurt. You wouldn\'t enter these battles if\r\nyou weren\'t sure you\'d come out safely."\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t deny it. Sport is sport; but I have no desire to be killed\r\nat it. At any rate, I\'m opposed to killing these swamp dragons. It\r\nsounds as though it would be boring, and, Makred knows, we had enough\r\nboredom butchering those dwarfs at our last stop."\r\n\r\nThe Lady Marid backed him. She also thought Venus unattractive. If the\r\nCaptain was of the opinion this war was too dangerous, wasn\'t there\r\nsome other conflict on this planet?\r\n\r\nThe Captain told them he\'d consult with his officers and let them know\r\nin the morning.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne thing was sure, Captain Foren thought, as he made his way toward\r\nthe officer\'s mess. He\'d have to get this group of thrill-crazy\r\nwastrels away from Troy. If one of them was hurt badly, he\'d\r\nundoubtedly lose his lucrative position on the swank cruise ship.\r\n\r\nThe idea was his own, really, and a good one. In a luxury mad world the\r\ncry was for new titillations, new pleasures, new planets on which to\r\nplay, new drugs to bring ever wilder dreams, new foods, new drinks, new\r\nloves; but, most of all, new thrills.\r\n\r\nYes, the idea of taking cruise ships of wealthy thrill seekers to the\r\nmore backward planets and letting them join in primitive wars, had been\r\nhis. It proved the thrill supreme. His cruises were the rage of half a\r\ndozen planets, and the company had increased his pay several times in\r\nthe past few years. But he knew it could crumple like a house of cards,\r\ngiven one serious injury to a wealthy guest. The theory of the cruise\r\nwas to let them kill without endangering themselves.\r\n\r\nThe stop at Troy, had, as a rule, been a successful one. The Greeks\r\nand their opponents were both highly superstitious and readily accepted\r\nthe presence of the aliens from space as Gods taking place in the\r\nbattle. Usually, they were too terrified to take measures against\r\nthe strangers in their gleaming armor, but today had been the second\r\noccasion in which a tourist had been injured, in spite of scientific,\r\nprotective armor.\r\n\r\nHis officers were awaiting him in the mess hall. They too had been\r\nconscious of the wounds suffered by the thrill seeking guests, and\r\nhadn\'t liked it. Lady Jan was the daughter of a noble strong enough to\r\nhave them all imprisoned, if the whim took him.\r\n\r\nCaptain Foren growled, "Have any of you an idea? I proposed the Venus\r\ntrip, but, although they admit being leary about further risks here,\r\nthey prefer fighting humanoids."\r\n\r\nFirst Officer Cajun said, "Perhaps it would be better to head for the\r\nhome planet, Captain."\r\n\r\nCaptain Foren shook his head. "We can\'t do that; the cruise has another\r\nweek to go. If we went back now it would be obvious that something had\r\nhappened and just bring matters to a head. If we can give them another\r\nweek of thrills, possibly they\'ll have forgotten their wounds by the\r\ntime we return."\r\n\r\nThe Chief Engineer turned to Cajun. "At what stage of development is\r\nthis planet?"\r\n\r\n"I believe it\'s at H-a. Why?"\r\n\r\n"I was wondering at the possibility of going forward a few thousand\r\nyears in time and participating in a war that dealt less in hand to\r\nhand conflict. They could have their fill of killing, with a minimum\r\nof danger--protected, of course, with suitable anti-projectile force\r\nfields."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCajun went over to the ship\'s Predictinformer and spoke into its\r\nmouthpiece. "What will be the military development of this planet in\r\ntwo or three thousand years; and would it be safe to take the ship into\r\nthat period?"\r\n\r\nThey awaited the answer, which came approximately one minute later.\r\n"Probability shows the inhabitants of Terra will begin utilizing\r\nexplosives for propelling missiles in two thousand years. About five\r\nhundred years later they will have developed this means of warfare to\r\nits ultimate. Safety for the ship is indicated."\r\n\r\nCaptain Foren mused, "That sounds practical. We could participate in\r\nsome war in which our passengers could use such weapons as snipers,\r\nfrom a distance." Another thought struck him. "Besides, the Lord\r\nGeneral Baris is quite intrigued with the possibilities involved in\r\nfighting the humanoids here. He had spoken of transporting large\r\nnumbers of his troops to Terra and using the planet for a training\r\nground in actual combat. Undoubtedly, the earthlings of the future\r\nwould make better victims for his soldiers than these more primitive\r\ntypes. It might be well to look at the future of this planet."\r\n\r\nThe First Engineer said, "Such a step would wipe out the development of\r\ncivilization on the planet."\r\n\r\nCaptain Foren shrugged impatiently. He ordered Cajun to make immediate\r\npreparations to take the ship forward twenty-five hundred years, and\r\ngave instructions to a sub-officer to locate a suitable conflict\r\nas soon as they arrived, so that the guests could begin their\r\nparticipation when they awoke in the morning.\r\n\r\nThe ship arrived effortlessly in its new location in time, but when the\r\nsub-officer returned from his patrol, First Officer Cajun took him to\r\nthe Captain\'s quarters himself.\r\n\r\nHe saluted. "I don\'t believe this is quite it, Captain.

=== Chunk 9 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Why not? Weren\'t there any wars in progress?"\r\n\r\nCajun said, "It wasn\'t that. There were several. They don\'t seem to\r\nhave reached the development for which we were looking. For instance,\r\nin the region in which we\'ve landed, the first stage of a conflict\r\nbetween two nations have begun. The countries are called Mexico and the\r\nUnited States and they\'re fighting over the northwestern possessions of\r\nthe former, although, as always, both sides claim they are involved for\r\nidealistic reasons. However, the fighting still consists, to an extent,\r\nof hand to hand conflict. The soldiers carry explosive propelled\r\nmissile weapons, but they\'re usually slow in loading and single shot\r\nin operation. Swords are carried at the ends of these weapons so that\r\nafter it is fired the soldier may dash forward and engage his enemy\r\npersonally."\r\n\r\nThe Captain was glum. "That\'s as bad as before, and I can\'t risk our\r\npassengers in any more hand to hand combat."\r\n\r\n"Sir, these humanoids on Terra seem slow in progressing but I have\r\nan idea if we move forward another hundred years they will be using\r\nautomatic weapons, and hand to hand combat will be antiquated. The\r\ncalendar system they use calls this the year 1845. I suggest we travel\r\nforward to 1945."\r\n\r\nCaptain Foren made a snap decision. "All right, we\'ll go forward a\r\ncentury. As soon as we arrive, have a patrol go out again."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Captain Foren awoke in the morning, the hot desert sun was already\r\nwell into the sky. The invisible space ship had stationed itself a\r\nhundred feet off the ground in an area in which there were no signs\r\nof habitation and few of the works of man. He strode leisurely to the\r\ncontrol room and returned the greetings of the morning watch.\r\n\r\n"Any word from the patrol as yet?" he asked.\r\n\r\nFirst Officer Cajun was worried. "No, sir, and he should\'ve been back\r\nlong before this."\r\n\r\n"I trust nothing has happened to him. Has he reported at all?"\r\n\r\n"Only once, several hours ago. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
Evidently there is a globewide war\r\nraging." Cajun ran his tongue over thin lips. "Our passengers should\r\nhave excellent sport. In fact, Captain, if you can spare me, I would\r\nlike to participate myself."\r\n\r\nCaptain Foren looked at him and laughed. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
"You, also? I\'m afraid this\r\nmust be a racial characteristic, this love of imposing death. I must\r\nconfess, on my first trips, I too liked to join in the sport." He\r\nturned and glanced out an observation port. "What is that steel tower\r\ndown there on the desert?"\r\n\r\n"We couldn\'t decide, Captain, unless it\'s some structure for conducting\r\ntests of some sort or other. The surprising thing about it is that our\r\ninstruments detect radio-activity...."\r\n\r\nThe Captain interrupted sharply, "Has anyone checked the ship\'s\r\nPredictinformer on whether or not this era is completely safe?"\r\n\r\nCajun said, "I assumed that you had, sir." He stepped to the instrument\r\nand spoke into its mouthpiece. "What is the military development of\r\nthis planet? Is the ship safe?"\r\n\r\nThe Predictinformer began its report. "\'In the past thirty-five years\r\nmilitary science on Terra has developed tremendously under the impetus\r\nof two world-wide conflicts. At present the dominant power on this\r\ncontinent is experimenting with nuclear fission....\'"\r\n\r\nSudden fear came into the eyes of the captain of the thrill ship. "That\r\nradioactive steel tower! Blast off," he shrieked, "Blast off!"\r\n\r\nThe Predictinformer went on dispassionately, "... and is about to test\r\nan atomic bomb against which this ship\'s defenses would be...."\r\n\r\nIt got no further.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
