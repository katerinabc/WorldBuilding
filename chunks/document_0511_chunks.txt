All three existed on Arz but there\r\nwas a question as to which was which._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny\r\nislet._]\r\n\r\nThe third night of the _Marco Four\'s_ landfall on the moonless Altarian\r\nplanet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission\r\nof drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell--it was his turn to\r\nstand watch--was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;\r\nbut in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the\r\ninevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\r\n\r\nSunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,\r\nbipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile\r\noffshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\r\n\r\n"They\'re at it again," Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf\r\noutside. "Roll out on the double! 

=== Chunk 2 ===
I\'m going to magnofilm this!"\r\n\r\nStryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,\r\nbelting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian\r\nclimate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,\r\nhis fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He\r\nlooked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired\r\ncook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\r\n\r\nGibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler\r\nto throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of\r\nthe crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and\r\nheavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\r\n\r\n"Any sign of the squids yet?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"They won\'t show up until the dragons come," Farrell said. He adjusted\r\nthe light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. "Lee, I\r\nwish you\'d let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This\r\nbutchery gets on my nerves."\r\n\r\nStryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on\r\nwater. "You know I can\'t do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to\r\nbe Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our\r\ntampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed\r\ninvasion. We\'ll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs\r\nand learn something of their mores before we can interfere."\r\n\r\nFarrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians\r\ngathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the\r\nsheltering bramble forest.\r\n\r\n"What stumps me is their motivation," he said. "Why do the fools go out\r\nto that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will\r\nhappen next morning?"\r\n\r\nGibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. "For\r\nthat matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the\r\nstratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we\'ve searched the\r\nentire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering\r\nof little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn\'t a\r\ncity these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was\r\nbeyond them by a million years."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nStryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something\r\nof a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence--coupled with an\r\nirritating habit of being right--had worn their patience thin.\r\n\r\n"There never was a city here, Gib," Stryker said. "You dozed off while\r\nwe were making planetfall, that\'s all."\r\n\r\nGibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell\'s voice cut his protest short.\r\n"Get set! 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Here they come!"\r\n\r\nOut of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty\r\nfeet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.\r\nThey stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian\r\nfishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around\r\nthe outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden\r\nuprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\r\n\r\n"The squids," Stryker grunted. "Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,\r\nas usual, to stop the slaughter."\r\n\r\nA barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the\r\nmelee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving\r\nbehind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like\r\nharpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\r\n\r\n"A neat example of dog eat dog," Farrell said, snapping off the\r\nmagnoscanner. "Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?"\r\n\r\nChattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn\r\nforest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the\r\nbeach to begin their day\'s fishing.\r\n\r\n"Nothing we\'ve seen yet could have built that city," Gibson said\r\nstubbornly. "But it\'s here somewhere, and I\'m going to find it. Will\r\neither of you be using the scouter today?"\r\n\r\nStryker threw up his hands. "I\'ve a mountain of data to collate, and\r\nArthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but\r\nyou won\'t find anything."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into\r\nhis sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over\r\nhis litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of\r\nsomething overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his\r\nconsciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him\r\nthat the discrepancy assumed definite form.\r\n\r\nHe recalled then that on the first day of the _Marco\'s_ planetfall one\r\nof the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and\r\nhad all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended\r\nspear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some\r\nwould surely have gone in after him.\r\n\r\nAnd the Marco\'s crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any\r\nslightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association\r\ncompleted itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his\r\ndoze.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be damned," he muttered. "No boats, and they don\'t swim. _Then how\r\nthe devil do they get out to that islet?_"\r\n\r\nHe fell asleep with the paradox unresolved.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nStryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his\r\ncubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over\r\nthe control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\r\n\r\n"Gibson found his lost city yet?" Farrell asked, and grinned when\r\nStryker snorted.\r\n\r\n"He\'s scouring the daylight side now," Stryker said. "Arthur, I\'m going\r\nto ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.\r\nHe\'s got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to\r\nunderstand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can\r\nbe."\r\n\r\nFarrell shrugged. "I\'d agree with you offhand if it weren\'t for Gib\'s\r\nbullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it\'s here.\r\nI\'ll probably be standing his watch until he\'s satisfied."\r\n\r\nStryker looked relieved. "Would you mind taking it tonight? I\'m\r\ncompletely bushed after today\'s logging."\r\n\r\nFarrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside\r\nalready, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist\r\natmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port\r\nand packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a\r\nnightcap before turning in.\r\n\r\nLater he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at\r\nthe moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man\'s\r\nsnoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety\r\nhush outside.\r\n\r\nFarrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.\r\nThe Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\r\n\r\nIt occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on\r\nthe islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,\r\nstartled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\r\n\r\nHe stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on\r\nthe springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days\r\nof dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that\r\nchafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the\r\nenigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and\r\nsquids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the\r\nknowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.\r\nThat is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird\r\ncustom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\r\n\r\nHe went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and\r\nfound it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means\r\nof transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when\r\nhis whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of\r\ninconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman\r\nrationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\r\n\r\nHe went inside again, and the sound of Stryker\'s muffled snoring fanned\r\nhis restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the\r\nmagnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he\r\nclipped to the belt of his shorts.\r\n\r\nHe did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch\r\nwould show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should\r\nneed help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without\r\nStryker\'s sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran\r\nRegulations, but--\r\n\r\n"Damn Terran Regulations," he muttered. "I\'ve got to _know_.

=== Chunk 4 ===
"\r\n\r\nFarrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered\r\nbriskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of\r\nthe bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the\r\nmossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and\r\nunrevealing.\r\n\r\nHe worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,\r\nbut nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering\r\nnight-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the\r\ncenter of the island without further discovery and was on the point of\r\nturning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him\r\nfrom behind.\r\n\r\nA sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming\r\nlassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His\r\nlast conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker--asleep\r\nand unprotected behind the _Marco\'s_ open port....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a\r\nprismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.\r\nFor a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye\r\nhe caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and\r\ncried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and\r\ncould not.\r\n\r\nHe was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary\r\nmuscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\r\n\r\nThe first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,\r\nbut for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the\r\ndanger of predicament. _Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first_,\r\nhe thought. _That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle._\r\n\r\nPanic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more\r\nseconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the\r\neffort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his\r\nbelt and call Stryker....\r\n\r\nHe bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and\r\nfailed.\r\n\r\nHis arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He\r\nrelaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery\r\nhalf-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny\r\nsurface ripples.\r\n\r\nOn shore he could see the _Marco Four_ resting between thorn forest and\r\nbeach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,\r\nand the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet\r\nreturned with the scouter.\r\n\r\nHe grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the\r\ncold surface of the audicom unit at his hip--unfelt before--was pressing\r\nagainst the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward\r\nmotion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring\r\nthrough him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\r\n\r\nThe tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\r\n\r\n"Stryker!" he yelled. "Lee, roll out--_Stryker_!"\r\n\r\nThe audicom hummed gently, without answer.\r\n\r\nHe gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of\r\nhorror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.\r\nWorn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be\r\neasily disturbed.\r\n\r\nThe flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above\r\nits reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless\r\nsuggestion of flapping wings.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe tried again. "Stryker, help me! I\'m on the islet!"\r\n\r\nThe audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker\'s, but\r\nGibson\'s.\r\n\r\n"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher\'s block?"\r\n\r\nFarrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
"Never mind that--get\r\nhere fast, Gib! The flying-lizards--"\r\n\r\nHe broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the\r\noutcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed\r\ntentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the\r\nunmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought\r\nwith shock-born lucidity: _I wanted a backstage look at this show, and\r\nnow I\'m one of the cast_.\r\n\r\nThe scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so\r\nclose above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost\r\ninstantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as\r\nGibson met the lizard swarm head on.\r\n\r\nGibson\'s voice came tinnily from the audicom. "Scattered them for the\r\nmoment, Arthur--blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand\r\nfast, now. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
I\'m going to pick you up."\r\n\r\nThe scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot\r\nwash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick\r\nbrown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.\r\nThe scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson\'s knees in\r\nthe cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\r\n\r\nFarrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green\r\nwater below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two\r\nof the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid\r\nArzian native carefully above water between them.\r\n\r\n"Gib," Farrell croaked. "Gib, can you risk a look back? 

=== Chunk 7 ===
I think I\'ve\r\ngone mad."\r\n\r\nThe scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. "You\'re all right,\r\nArthur. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
Just hang on tight. I\'ll explain everything when we get you safe\r\nin the _Marco_."\r\n\r\nFarrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the\r\npainful pricking of returning sensation. "I might have known it, damn\r\nyou," he said. "You found your lost city, didn\'t you?"\r\n\r\nGibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with\r\nhimself over some private stupidity. "I\'d have found it sooner if I\'d\r\nhad any brains. It was under water, of course."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the _Marco Four_, Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed\r\ndrinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control\r\nchair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell\'s fear\r\nof being permanently disabled.\r\n\r\n"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn\'t go high\r\nenough," Gibson said. "I realized that finally, remembering how they\r\nused high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and\r\nwhen I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean\r\nbottom--a city to compare with anything men ever built."\r\n\r\nStryker stared. "A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for\r\nbuildings?"\r\n\r\n"None," Gibson said. "I think the city must have been built ages ago--by\r\nmen or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture--and was\r\nsubmerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original\r\nbuilders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids\r\ntook over then, and from all appearances they\'ve developed a culture of\r\ntheir own."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see it," Stryker complained, shaking his head. "The pink\r\nfishers--"\r\n\r\n"Are cattle, or less," Gibson finished. "The octopods are the dominant\r\nrace, and they\'re so far above Fifth Order that we\'re completely out of\r\nbounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can\'t colonize Arz. It would be\r\narmed invasion."\r\n\r\n"Invasion of a squid world?" Farrell protested, baffled. "Why should\r\nsurface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why\r\ncouldn\'t we share the planet?"\r\n\r\n"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,"\r\nGibson said patiently. "They even own the pink fishers. It was one of\r\nthe squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick\r\na couple of victims for this morning\'s show, that carried you off last\r\nnight."\r\n\r\n"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up," Stryker said. He laughed\r\nsuddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. "Arz is a squid\'s\r\nworld, Arthur, don\'t you see? And like most civilized peoples, they\'re\r\nsportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the\r\npink fishers for--"\r\n\r\nFarrell swore in astonishment. "Then those poor devils are put out there\r\ndeliberately, like worms on a hook--angling in reverse! 

=== Chunk 9 ===
No wonder I\r\ncouldn\'t spot their motivation!"\r\n\r\nGibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.\r\n"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before\r\nthe octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up\r\nto the acceleration, Arthur?"\r\n\r\nFarrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: "You\r\ndon\'t think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?"\r\n\r\nHe and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,\r\nblasted the _Marco Four_ free of Arz.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s The Anglers of Arz, by Roger Phillips Dee\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
