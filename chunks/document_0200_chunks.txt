=== Chunk 2 ===
He was going to refuse to die._\r\n\r\n\r\nBart Neely was fighting the hypo. They\'d slipped that over on him. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Now\r\nhe had to struggle to keep his brain ready for plan B. The alternate\r\nplan. He nodded feebly at his reflection in the mirror over the white\r\nenamel dresser. This throat-trouble wasn\'t going to lick him. He lay\r\nback on the cool white pillow. Medical men always thought theirs was the\r\nfinal answer; well, psychologists like himself knew there was a broader\r\nview of man than the anatomical. There was a vast region of energy at\r\nman\'s disposal; the switch to turn it on, located in the brain.\r\n\r\nRubber-soled shoes squished across the bare floor as Dr. Jonas Morton\r\ncame into Bart\'s room. His hair was hidden by a sterile cap, his arms\r\nbare to well above the elbows.\r\n\r\nLooks like a damned butcher, thought Bart.\r\n\r\n"Bart, I want you to reconsider the anesthetic. I think you ought to be\r\nout for this one, completely out." The doctor\'s voice became a shade\r\nless professional. "I don\'t tell you how to run your perception\r\nexperiments, I think you ought to let me judge what\'s best in the\r\nsurgical area."\r\n\r\n"No," Bart whispered hoarsely. It was hell squeezing the words out.\r\nLifting his voice these days was harder than lifting a half-ton truck.\r\n"Must be conscious, able to decide." Jonas had to lean down to catch all\r\nthe words. "Not going to let you take my voice while I\'m unconscious ...\r\nhelpless ..."\r\n\r\nDr. Morton shook his head. "You\'re the boss."\r\n\r\n"How soon?"\r\n\r\n"Twenty minutes." The professional tone became pronounced again. "Your\r\nwife\'s outside waiting to see you. Don\'t get emotional, I don\'t want\r\nyour endocrine system in an uproar." The doctor stepped out into the\r\ncorridor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEmotional. He mustn\'t think about it. He might weaken, consent to linger\r\non, an invalid, just to be with Vivian a few extra years. Extra years of\r\nindignities calculated to twist the man-woman relationship into an ugly\r\ndistortion. How romantic it would be, he and Vivian locked in an\r\nembrace, the silky softness of her hair falling across his arm, the\r\npressure of her fingers on his back. And then, instead of placing his\r\nmouth against her ear and whispering the familiar intimacies, he would\r\nswitch on the light, disengage himself so that he could whip out a pad\r\nand pencil and ...\r\n\r\nHis heart skipped at the sound pattern of high heels on the corridor.\r\nVivian, Vivian. Her perfume pricked his senses and it took effort to\r\nshut out the emotional response. "Remember the need for an alternate\r\nplan," he reminded himself fiercely and then looked up into his wife\'s\r\nclear green eyes. Without a word she bent down and lay her face next to\r\nhis. He was struck with the warmth of her. He gently pushed her head\r\naway. "Vi." (My Lord, his eyes were wet ... what a schoolboy\r\nperformance!) "Vi, you know I don\'t want to go on here ... if radical\r\nsurgery is necessary. I want you to remember me as a whole man, not\r\na ... dummy.

=== Chunk 4 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Bart, oh Bart." There was a frown of apprehension on her forehead. She\r\nsighed heavily and whispered, "Can it make so much difference when I\r\nlove you Bart?"\r\n\r\n"But don\'t you see, Vi? It may not be Bart Neely they wheel back here\r\nafter the operation." He motioned for her to bend closer for the sound\r\nof his voice was becoming weaker. "In my field I\'ve seen a lot of crazy\r\nreactions to loss of basic ability. Personality reversals brought about\r\nby loss of hearing, impotency, or even the inability to bear a child."\r\nHe stroked the back of her hand with his finger. "Bart Neely without a\r\nvoice-box might be a stranger. I\'m not sure you\'d like him. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
I don\'t\r\nthink I\'d even like him."\r\n\r\nAn intern backed into the room followed by a gurney. Bart shot a look at\r\nVi. "This is plan A."\r\n\r\nVi\'s eyebrows arched in a question.\r\n\r\n"Exploration and ..." he paused; the nurse tucked a dark gray blanket\r\nall around him. He raised his thin white hand and crossed two fingers ...\r\n"and we hope, a negative biopsy."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was no pain. Whatever the anesthetist had worked out was doing\r\nnicely. The overhead light, however, was giving him a headache and the\r\noperating room was damned cold. Jonas and Holsclaw weren\'t talking\r\nmuch, and what they did say wasn\'t loud enough for Bart to get. He\r\nstudied their faces. "I\'ll know by their faces," he assured himself,\r\n"and if it\'s widespread malignancy I\'ll proceed with plan B."\r\n\r\nThe sweat was heavy on Jonas\' forehead. The sterile mask hid his nose\r\nand mouth, but his eyes, behind the lenses of his glasses, looked moist\r\nand tired. The surgeon\'s gloved fingers manipulated, probed, cut.\r\nFinally, he turned to a waiting nurse.\r\n\r\n"Get this analyzed right away." That was it, the tissue ... was it\r\ncancerous or not? The atmosphere grew heavy. Bart watched the second\r\nhand on the large wall-clock swing slowly around its perimeter, and then\r\naround again and again. The nurse reentered and spoke softly to the\r\ndoctor. The two doctors whispered, explaining to each other with hand\r\nmotions what they were going to do.\r\n\r\nThis is it. Bart was certain. Well, he\'d fool the hell out of the\r\nknow-it-all doctors. He closed his eyes and thought. The years he had\r\nspent sharpening his perception, his ability to transfer his thoughts,\r\nwere just the groundwork for this greatest experiment of all. He had\r\ntransferred thought waves in all forms to all corners of this world with\r\nthe highest percentage of accuracy. Now Plan B, the alternate plan, was\r\nto transfer himself! He was willing himself out of his own body. He\r\ncould feel the perspiration trickle down his arms with the effort. It\r\nhad to work. He had to cheat them out of their mutilation. No, he\r\ncouldn\'t fail. He strained against the confines of his body, burdening\r\nhis brain with thought, and suddenly he was free. Bart wanted to shriek\r\nwith laughter. He\'d outwitted them. There stood gray-faced Jonas working\r\nover that shell, not even realizing that it was an empty body. It was\r\nlike a television play or something; everyone clustered around a poor\r\nstiff on the operating table, repeating the litany of the saw-bones.\r\n"Scalpel ... sponge ... clamps ..."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBart mentally chuckled and fluttered himself upwards; above the\r\nsquare-shaped hospital with its rows of tiny windows. Beyond the\r\npolluted air of the city. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Up and up, until there was nothing to look\r\nback on. Nothing.\r\n\r\nNow Bart perceived something ahead. It appeared to be a body of land. It\r\nlooked marvelously appealing, dark greens, bright yellows, and all the\r\nshades in between. He hurried forward, eager to explore what lay ahead.\r\nBut as he drew closer, becoming more excited over its possibilities, he\r\nstruck a cold hard surface which repelled him. It was like glass and\r\nthrough it Bart could see a poorly defined figure some distance away.\r\nBart was intrigued. This was a mental barrier thrown up by the fellow on\r\nthe other side. Well, he\'d give the guy some competition. Bart\r\nconcentrated on cracking the wall, building a visual picture of the\r\nbreak-through in his mind.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"It\'s useless. You can\'t enter here."\r\n\r\n"Why do you oppose me?" Bart tested the unseen wall, but found no\r\nweakness in its structure.\r\n\r\n"We don\'t care for your sort."\r\n\r\n"Is that so. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
And how have you classified me?"\r\n\r\n"As a coward. A suicide. A man of meager resources."\r\n\r\n"I\'m nothing of the kind. In the first place, I did not commit suicide."\r\nBart wished he could kick at the invisible wall. "I willed myself away\r\nfrom an imperfect shell. I severed the mind from the body."\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"Because I had cancer of the larynx, and I\'d never have been able to\r\ntalk again. I\'d be less than a man."\r\n\r\n"You are less than a man now." There was a long period of no exchange.\r\nBart decided he had not made himself clear. "I didn\'t want to live\r\nwithout being able to communicate with other men and women."\r\n\r\n"Communicate. Communicate. There are a million ways to communicate.\r\nMichelangelo communicated, Bach, Beethoven, yes, Elvis Presley\r\ncommunicates. Hemingway, Martha Graham, actors, dancers, even a baby\r\ncommunicates!"\r\n\r\n"But speech ..."\r\n\r\n"Speech is the least dependable method of all. Few people can explain\r\ntheir love, their pain, their innermost feelings in words. And often a\r\nman speaks his thoughts, and having spoken them, finds he really thinks\r\nthe opposite. No, this is second-rate expression and my opinion of you\r\nhas not been altered by your feeble argument."\r\n\r\nThe other fellow\'s thoughts came over the wall, pounding against Bart\'s\r\nsub-conscious. "You consider yourself a man of great intelligence," it\r\nwent on, "but your lack of imagination makes you less than mediocre. And\r\nas for your mind-power, well, you see you cannot cross my mental\r\nbarrier."\r\n\r\n"That\'s not entirely conclusive. There may be a catalyst here in this\r\narea which works in conjunction with your thought-processes and not\r\nmine. You\'re familiar with conditions here, while I only know the\r\nearth."\r\n\r\n"You are hardly a challenge to me. However, to satisfy you that you have\r\npractically no control, let us make a test on your home ground."\r\n\r\n"All right. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
You propose the test."\r\n\r\n"Let us see ... if you can re-enter your former body while I am willing\r\nyou to stay here, on the other side of that wall."\r\n\r\n"Ahah. You\'re trying to trick me."\r\n\r\n"I knew before I proposed my plan you would make exactly that excuse in\r\norder to escape my challenge. Even in excuses you lacked imagination."\r\n\r\n"Okay, it\'s a deal." Bart was mad. "Start concentrating. I\'ll show you\r\nthe power of my mind, both now and after I resume that shell." Bart was\r\nfurious. He tried to leave the place by the wall. He seemed stuck. There\r\nwere waves like laughter vibrating against the glass. Bart strained and\r\nsaw that he had come away a little. He tried again and again. There was\r\na little more distance gained. He tried to build the picture of the\r\noperating-room in his mind and while he was doing this a flash of Vivian\r\nexploded his mind. With that quick image, he felt himself free to drift\r\ndownward.\r\n\r\nThere indeed was the hospital. Bart hurried to the operating-room,\r\nhovering near the ceiling light, watching the operating team below.\r\n\r\n"He\'s gone, doctor." The anesthetist looked at Jonas. "Respiration\'s\r\nstopped altogether."\r\n\r\n_No_, thought Bart. _Don\'t close me out now._\r\n\r\n"Let\'s open the chest and massage the heart."\r\n\r\n_Yes. Yes._\r\n\r\n"I think it\'s futile, doctor.

=== Chunk 9 ===
"\r\n\r\n"We can try."\r\n\r\n_Good old Jonas._ Bart floated to the table and forced himself into the\r\nshell which lay white and unmoving under the penetrating light from\r\nabove. It wasn\'t easy, Bart tried to move the heavy hand, but it was\r\nquite numb.\r\n\r\n"Not a thing. Might as well quit."\r\n\r\n_Holsclaw\'s in a hurry. Damn him._\r\n\r\n"I\'ll massage a little longer."\r\n\r\nBart pushed at the leaden eyelid. No go. _Come on, come on._ He felt a\r\nconvulsive chill, a throbbing in his head.\r\n\r\n"I\'m getting a pulse." Jonas\' voice was excited.\r\n\r\nBart knew there was a searing pain in his throat, but shutting it out of\r\nhis consciousness was the steady, thumping beat of his own heart.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Science Fiction Stories_\r\n    September 1958.
