Since there are so few Martians left, those\r\nfacts are less surprising than that the third did.\r\n\r\nFor many years before space flight was accomplished, there had been\r\ndiscussions and theories about how to communicate with Martians, if any\r\nexisted. But, of course, nobody was ready when the time came.\r\n\r\nThey fell back on that antiquated gimmick.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVon Frisch, Riley and Smith watched the half dozen Martians approach,\r\nand their watching was not without some trepidation. Except that they\r\nwere about twenty miles away from their G-boat--the planetary landing\r\ncraft--they probably would have fled. Except that they had their\r\norders, they probably would have shot first and asked questions later.\r\n\r\n"Sir, this is Von Frisch," said the engineer into the microphone of his\r\nhelmet. He was a little breathless about it. "We\'re being approached by\r\nMartians!"\r\n\r\n"How do they act?" asked Captains Powers back at the G-boat,\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n"They don\'t act hostile, sir."\r\n\r\n"Stand by, then, but don\'t take any chances.

What do they look like?"\r\n\r\n"They\'re quite a bit taller than we are, but their bodies are round\r\nand not much bigger than a child\'s. They\'ve got real long legs and\r\narms, and big heads with big eyes and ears."\r\n\r\n"Are they intelligent? Are they civilized? How do they breathe?"\r\n\r\n"Wait a minute, Captain," protested Von Frisch. "You\'re going a little\r\ntoo fast, sir. They\'ve just come up to us. I don\'t know whether that\'s\r\nfur on them or whether they\'re wearing clothes."\r\n\r\n"Well, try to communicate with them, man!" exclaimed Powers excitedly.\r\n\r\nVon Frisch did his best. The Martians appeared friendly enough, and\r\ninterested. Von Frisch tried to communicate in the only method he had\r\nheard about.\r\n\r\nWhile his companions watched curiously, he shut his ears to the running\r\nfire of questions from Powers, squatted and drew a right angled\r\ntriangle in the red desert sand. By one of the sides he drew three\r\nmarks, by another four.\r\n\r\nThen he stepped back and looked questioningly at the Martians.\r\n\r\nOne of the Martians squatted in a tangle of pipestem arms and legs, and\r\nwith a long finger drew five lines beside the triangle\'s hypotenuse.\r\n\r\n"They understand the Pythagorean theorem, sir!" exclaimed Von Frisch.\r\n\r\n"Good! They undoubtedly know some astronomy, then. Go on."\r\n\r\nVon Frisch hesitated a moment, then erased the triangle. He drew a\r\nsmall circle with rays from it, for the sun. He drew four larger\r\nconcentric circles around it, with small circles for planets on the\r\nrim of each one.\r\n\r\nHe pointed to the third planet, then at himself, then at his\r\ncompanions, one by one. Then he pointed at the fourth planet and at the\r\nMartians, one by one. To complete the matter, he pointed at the sky.\r\n\r\n"We are Earthmen," he said. "You are Martians."\r\n\r\nThe trouble was that the Earthmen didn\'t realize the things the\r\nMartians had were weapons until they used them. They didn\'t realize it\r\nthen, as a matter of fact, because the Earthmen were dead, all three of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n_The Martian hunting party came back from the desert with word of the\r\nstrange creatures who came, apparently, from another world._\r\n\r\n_"Whether they have weapons, we do not know," said the leader of the\r\nhunting party. "But they wished to harm our people, so we killed them\r\nall.

"_\r\n\r\n_"That is desperate action," said the patriarch of the village. "In\r\nwhat way were they dangerous to us?"_\r\n\r\n_"Foolishly they disclosed their intention to us," replied the leader\r\nof the hunting party. "They informed us they planned to take over our\r\nworld and to drive our people farther from the sun, to the great planet\r\nJupiter."_\r\n\r\n_"Then you did right," said the patriarch, blinking his big eyes._\r\n\r\nBiggs and Golden were working near the G-boat. Their helmet radios were\r\nset to a different channel from that used by the exploring party, so\r\nthey were unable to hear Captain Powers shouting frantically into his\r\nmicrophone and getting no answer. It was just after sunset, and Biggs\r\nwas looking into the west.\r\n\r\n"We ought to see it now, but it ain\'t there," commented Biggs.\r\n\r\n"What ain\'t there?" demanded Golden.\r\n\r\n"Mercury," said Biggs, who prided himself on being an amateur\r\nastronomer. "I reckon you can\'t see it from Mars without a telescope.\r\nToo close to the sun."\r\n\r\nHe chuckled.\r\n\r\n"If there are any Martians," he added, "I reckon they think _they_ live\r\non the third planet. That\'s funny, ain\'t it?
