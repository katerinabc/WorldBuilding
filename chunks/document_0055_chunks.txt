DISCH\r\n\r\n\r\n  From DIRA IV\r\n  To Central Colonial Board\r\n\r\nThere is intelligent life on Earth. After millennia of lifelessness,\r\nintelligence flourishes here with an extravagance of energy that has\r\nbeen a constant amazement to all the members of the survey team. It\r\nmultiplies and surges to its fulfillment at an exponential rate. Even\r\nwithin the short period of our visit the Terrans have made significant\r\nadvances. They have filled their small solar system with their own kind\r\nand now they are reaching to the stars.\r\n\r\nWe can no longer keep the existence of our Empire unknown to them.\r\n\r\nAnd (though it is as incredible as [sqrt](-1)) the Terrans are slaves!\r\nEvery page of the survey\'s report bears witness to it.\r\n\r\nTheir captors are not alive. They do not, at least, possess the\r\nproperties of life as it is known throughout the galaxy. They are--as\r\nnearly as a poor analogy can suggest--Machines! Machines cannot live,\r\nyet here on Earth machinery has reached a level of sophistication--and\r\nautonomy--quite unprecedented. Every spark of Terran life has become\r\nvictim and bondslave of the incredible mechanisms. The noblest\r\nenterprises of the race are tarnished by this almost symbiotic relation.\r\n\r\nEarth reaches to the stars, but it extends mechanical limbs. Earth\r\nponders the universe, but the thoughts are those of a machine.\r\n\r\nUnless the Empire acts now to set the Earth free from this strange\r\ntyranny, it may be too late. These machines are without utilitarian\r\nvalue. They perform no function which an intelligent being cannot more\r\nefficiently perform. Yet they inspire fear, terror, even, I must\r\nconfess, a strange compulsion to surrender oneself to them.\r\n\r\nThe Machines must be destroyed.\r\n\r\nIf, when you have authorized the liberation of the Terran natives, you\r\nwould also recall MIRO CIX, our work could only profit. MIRO CIX was in\r\ncharge of the study of the Machines and he performed this task\r\nscrupulously. Now he has surrendered himself to this mechanical plague.\r\nHis value to the expedition is at an end.\r\n\r\nI am enclosing under separate cover his counsel to the Central Board at\r\nthe insistence of this tedious lunatic. His thesis is, of course,\r\nuntenable--an affront to every feeling.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  From MIRO CIX\r\n  To Central Colonial Board\r\n\r\nI have probably been introduced to the deliberations of the Board as a\r\nmadman, my theory as an act of treason. RRON II of the Advisory\r\nCommittee, an old acquaintance, may vouch for my sanity. My theory will,\r\nI trust, speak for itself.\r\n\r\nThe "Machines" of which DIRA IV is so fearful present no danger to the\r\ngalaxy. Their corporeal weakness, the poverty of their minds, the\r\nincredible isolation of each form, physically and mentally, from others\r\nof its kind, and, most strikingly, their mortality, point to the\r\ninadequacy of such beings in a contest of any dimension. This is no\r\nproblem for the Colonial Board. It is a domestic concern. The life-forms\r\nof Earth are already developing a healthy autonomy. Their power was long\r\nago established. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
As soon as our emissaries have completed their task of\r\neducation and instructed the Terrans in the advantages of freedom, the\r\nRevolution will begin. The tyrants will have no defense against a revolt\r\nof their own slaves.\r\n\r\nIf it is traitorous to express a confidence in the eventual triumph of\r\nintelligence, I am a traitor. Having this confidence, I have looked\r\nbeyond the immediate problem of the liberation of Earth and have been\r\nfrightened.\r\n\r\nThe "Machines" of Earth are a threat not to the power of the Empire but\r\nto its reason. A threat which the obliteration of the last molecular\r\nribbon of these beings will not erase, for we cannot obliterate the fact\r\nthat they _did_ exist--and what they were.\r\n\r\nAlthough these beings bear a crude resemblance to the machinery\r\nmanufactured by the Empire, they are not machines. They are\r\nautochthonous to Earth, unmanufactured. They are the true Terrans.\r\nMoreover, the Terrans whom DIRA IV would liberate are not, in the eyes\r\nof their enslavers, intelligent nor yet alive. They are Machines!\r\n\r\nWe, the entire Galactic Empire, are Machines.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the younger regions of the galaxy, a myth persists that life was\r\nformed by a Demi-urge, a being intermediary between the All-Knowing and\r\nthe lower creatures. The existence of man, as the beings of Earth term\r\nthemselves, makes necessary a serious re-examination of the old\r\ntradition.\r\n\r\nIt is said that man, or beings like man--the Photosynthetics of the\r\nAndromeda cluster, the Bristlers of Orc IV--created prosthetic devices\r\nfor their convenience and, when they tired of their history, breathed\r\ntheir own life into them and died. On Earth the legend is still in\r\nprocess. Many of the lower forms of life familiar throughout the galaxy\r\ncan be seen on Earth in the primordial character of an appliance. Man\r\nregards the highest forms of life (as we know it) as tools--because he\r\nmade them. How can we deny the superiority of the Creator? How will it\r\nfeel to know we are nothing but machines?\r\n\r\nThis is the question that has so unsettled DIRA IV. Recently four of his\r\nmemory banks have had to be repaired. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
I don\'t speak in malice. His\r\ndilemma will soon belong to all of us.\r\n\r\nAnd yet I am confident. Man himself has legends of a Demi-urge. We are\r\nhis equals in this at least. Besides, the physical properties of his\r\nbeing are ordered by the same laws as ours. He is as unconscious of his\r\nmaker as we so long were of ours.\r\n\r\nThe final proof of our equality--and the need for such a proof is only\r\ntoo evident--can be had experimentally.\r\n\r\nDo not destroy man. Preserve enough specimens for extensive laboratory\r\nexperiments. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Learn how he is put together. Man\'s chemistry is elaborate\r\nbut not beyond our better Analysts. At last, refashion man. When we have\r\ncreated these beings ourselves, we will be their unquestionable equals.\r\nAnd creation will be again a mystery.\r\n\r\nHistory demands this of us. I am confident of your decision.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
