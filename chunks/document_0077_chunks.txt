]\r\n\r\n\r\nJoe had quite a day for himself Thursday and as usual I had to tag\r\nalong. If I had a right arm to give I\'d give it for a day off now and\r\nthen. Like on Thursday. On Thursday he really outdid himself.\r\n\r\nHe woke up in the hotel room and had a shower. He wasn\'t going to shave\r\nuntil I told him he looked like a bum. So he shaved and then he stood\r\nfor a whole minute admiring his beauty in the mirror, forgetting whose\r\nidea it was in the first place.\r\n\r\nSo down to the coffee shop for breakfast. A hard-working man needs a\r\ngood breakfast. So getting ready for a backbreaking day of copying\r\nreferences at the library, he had tomato juice, two fried eggs, three\r\nsausages, a sugared doughnut and coffee--with cream and sugar.\r\n\r\nHe couldn\'t work that off his pot in a week of ditch-digging under\r\na July sun, but a hard-working man needs a good breakfast. I was\r\ntoo disgusted to argue with him. He\'s hopeless when he smells that\r\nshort-order smell of smoking grease, frying bacon and coffee.\r\n\r\nHe wanted to take a taxi to the library--eight blocks!\r\n\r\n"Walk, you jerk!" I told him. He started to mumble about pulling down\r\nsix hundred bucks for this week\'s work and then he must have thought\r\nI was going to mention the high-calorie breakfast. To him that\'s\r\nhitting below the belt. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
He thinks he\'s an unfortunate man with an\r\naffliction--about twenty pounds of it. He walked and arrived at the\r\nlibrary glowing with virtue.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMaking out his slip at the newspaper room he blandly put down next to\r\n_firm_--_The Griffin Press, Inc._--when he knew as well as I did that\r\nhe was a free lance and hadn\'t even got a definite assignment from\r\nGriffin.\r\n\r\nThere\'s a line on the slip where you put down _reason for consulting\r\nfiles (please be specific)_. It\'s a shame to cramp Joe\'s style to\r\njust one line after you pitch him an essay-type question like that.\r\nHe squeezed in, _Preparation of article on year in biochemistry for\r\nGriffin Pr. Encyc. 1952 Yrbk._, and handed it with a flourish to the\r\nlibrarian.\r\n\r\nThe librarian, a nice old man, was polite to him, which is usually\r\na mistake with Joe. After he finished telling the librarian how his\r\nmicrofilm files ought to be organized and how they ought to switch from\r\nmicrofilm to microcard and how in spite of everything the New York\r\nPublic Library wasn\'t such a bad place to research, he got down to work.\r\n\r\nHe\'s pretty harmless when he\'s working--it\'s one of the things that\r\nkeeps me from cutting his throat. With a noon break for apple pie and\r\ncoffee he transcribed about a hundred entries onto his cards, mopping\r\nup the year in biochemistry nicely. He swaggered down the library\r\nsteps, feeling like Herman Melville after finishing Moby Dick.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be so smug," I told him. "You still have to write the piece. And\r\nthey still have to buy it."\r\n\r\n"A detail," he said grandly. "Just journalism. I can do it with my eyes\r\nshut."\r\n\r\nJust journalism. Somehow his three months of running copy for the A.P.\r\nbefore the war has made him an Ed Leahy.\r\n\r\n"_When_ are you going to do it with your eyes...?" I began but it\r\nwasn\'t any use. He began telling me about how Gautama Buddha didn\'t\r\nbreak with the world until he was 29 and Mohammed didn\'t announce that\r\nhe was a prophet until he was 30, so why couldn\'t _he_ one of these\r\ndays suddenly bust loose with a new revelation or something and set the\r\nworld on its ear? What it boiled down to was he didn\'t think he\'d write\r\nthe article tonight.\r\n\r\nHe postponed his break with the world long enough to have a ham and\r\ncheese on rye and more coffee at an automat and then phoned Maggie. She\r\nwas available as usual. She said as usual, "Well then, why don\'t you\r\njust drop by and we\'ll spend a quiet evening with some records?"\r\n\r\nAs usual he thought that would be fine since he was so beat after a\r\nhard day. As usual I told him, "You\'re a louse, Joe. You know all she\r\nwants is a husband and you know it isn\'t going to be you, so why don\'t\r\nyou let go of the girl so she can find somebody who means business?"\r\n\r\nThe usual answers rolled out automatically and we got that out of the\r\nway.\r\n\r\nMaybe Maggie isn\'t very bright but she seemed glad to see him. She\'s\r\nshooting for her Doctorate in sociology at N.Y.U., she does part-time\r\ncase work for the city, she has one of those three-room Greenwich\r\nVillage apartments with dyed burlap drapes and studio couches and\r\nhome-made mobiles. She thinks writing is something holy and Joe\'s\r\ncareful not to tell her different.\r\n\r\nThey drank some rhine wine and seltzer while Joe talked about the\r\nday\'s work as though he\'d won the Nobel prize for biochemistry. He got\r\ndownright brutal about Maggie being mixed up in such an approximate\r\nunquantitative excuse for a science as sociology and she apologized\r\nhumbly and eventually he forgave her. Big-hearted Joe.\r\n\r\nBut he wasn\'t so fried that he _had_ to start talking about a man\r\nwanting to settle down--"not this year but maybe next. Thirty\'s a\r\ndividing point that makes you stop and wonder what you really want and\r\nwhat you\'ve really got out of life, Maggie darlin\'." It was as good as\r\ntelling her that she should be a good girl and continue to keep open\r\nhouse for him and maybe some day ... maybe.\r\n\r\nAs I said, maybe Maggie isn\'t very bright. But as I also said,\r\nThursday was the day Joe picked to outdo himself.\r\n\r\n"Joe," she said with this look on her face, "I got a new LP of the\r\nBrahms Serenade Number One. It\'s on top of the stack. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Would you tell me\r\nwhat you think of it?"\r\n\r\nSo he put it on and they sat sipping rhine wine and seltzer and he\r\nturned it over and they sat sipping rhine wine and seltzer until both\r\nsides were played. And she kept watching him. Not adoringly.\r\n\r\n"Well," she asked with this new look, "what did you think of it?"\r\n\r\nHe told her, of course. There was some comment on Brahms\'\r\narchitectonics and his resurrection of the contrapuntal style. Because\r\nhe\'d sneaked a look at the record\'s envelope he was able to spend a\r\ncouple of minutes on Brahms\' debt to Haydn and the young Beethoven in\r\nthe fifth movement (_allegro_, D Major) and the gay _rondo_ of the--\r\n\r\n"Joe," she said, not looking at him. "Joe," she said, "I got that\r\nrecord at one hell of a discount down the street. It\'s a wrong\r\npressing. Somehow the first side is the first half of the Serenade but\r\nthe second half is Schumann\'s Symphonic Studies Opus Thirteen. Somebody\r\nnoticed it when they played it in a booth. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
But I guess you didn\'t\r\nnotice it."\r\n\r\n"Get out of _this one_, braino," I told him.\r\n\r\nHe got up and said in a strangled voice, "And I thought you were my\r\nfriend. I suppose I\'ll never learn." He walked out.\r\n\r\nI suppose he never will.\r\n\r\nGod help me, I ought to know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
