]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the charts, it\'s P-1345-AZ, and a thin blue line marked with cryptic\r\nletters indicates that a Mallor Lines cargo ship stops three times in\r\neach local year. The Guide will tell you a little more; that it\'s a\r\nsmall hot planet, covered with fern forests and swamps, and inhabited\r\nby one of the innumerable primate-human species of the universe. It was\r\nalso inhabited, for a while, by one Terran, James Grady.\r\n\r\nThe natives call it Pru\'ut, which, freely translated, means "the\r\nworld." They refer to themselves as Kya, which means "people." James\r\nGrady, being a realist, called it the Mudhole, and added a descriptive\r\nadjective or two; but he did not find it nearly as unpleasant a place\r\nas a few others in which he had been in the course of forty years of\r\nwandering.\r\n\r\nPru\'ut has no inclination, and only one season, which is rather like a\r\nrainy August on Earth. When Grady arrived, he stepped from the landing\r\nstage of the Mallor Lines\' _Berenice_ into six inches of gluey mud; the\r\nsun was seldom out long enough to harden the surface of Pru\'ut.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not an easy place," the departing agent, Jansen, told Grady.\r\n"Rain, and heat, and getting along with the locals."\r\n\r\n"Anything the matter with \'em?" 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Grady asked. He was watching the tall,\r\nyellow-pale shapes of natives loading bales into the _Berenice\'s_ cargo\r\nslings.\r\n\r\n"Nothing much," Jansen said. "Sane as any primitives. All kinds of\r\ncomplicated rules and taboos, and naturally they\'ll get as mad as hell\r\nat you if you scratch a single rule. Most of the data on that is in\r\nthe agent\'s notebooks. You add anything to the record that seems to be\r\nworth putting down, the way the rest of us have."\r\n\r\n"And if they get mad at you, they stop packing plants," the\r\n_Berenice\'s_ mate put in. "Which will make the Mallor Company mad at\r\nyou, too. This place is a regular bargain basement for drug materials.\r\nAt least eight different drug plants, all of them worth as much as\r\nuranium. More, in some ways."\r\n\r\n"Mm." The ex-agent picked up a handful of brown leaves from a table.\r\n"This, for instance. It\'s a distant relation of coca. The natives chew\r\nit for fun, but it\'s the source of a first class anesthetic. And this.\r\nIf your kidneys ever break down, the doctors use this stuff to keep\r\nyou alive. Kerosin, it\'s called. Anyway, you\'ll find price lists and\r\ndescriptive material in the files. You\'ve worked for Mallor before,\r\nhaven\'t you?

=== Chunk 4 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Yes," Grady said. "I put in three years on Tengo, in Port City. Then I\r\nquit for a while. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Had something else to do."\r\n\r\n"Oh? 

=== Chunk 6 ===
What?"\r\n\r\nGrady\'s face cracked into a slight grin. "Little bit of an argument.\r\nThe Mutiny. I joined the local army, if you could call it that. I had\r\nmy own gun, so they made me a major on the spot."\r\n\r\n"The Mutiny?" The _Berenice\'s_ mate had heard of that brief and savage\r\nwar, in which a handful of settlers and local militia had beaten\r\noff the troops of a powerful state, and had actually won. The mate\r\nhastily readjusted his opinion of Grady upward. A trader\'s agent was\r\none thing; a man who had fought through the Mutiny was something more\r\nthan that. The mate opened his mouth to ask more of the story; but the\r\n_Berenice\'s_ air-horn cut him off with a long wail.\r\n\r\n"Take-off in twenty minutes," the mate said, as the noise subsided.\r\n"You ready, Jansen?"\r\n\r\nThe ex-agent nodded, and shook hands with Grady. "Good luck," he said,\r\nand started for the ship, the mate following.\r\n\r\n"Yeah," Grady said, closing the door of the agency. He had completely\r\nput the _Berenice_ out of his mind by the time the roar of her\r\ndeparture split the wet air of Pru\'ut. He was, in fact, well on his way\r\nto settling down as a permanent resident by that time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA year later, the _Berenice_ had called twice, and her captain and mate\r\nwere calling Grady by his first name. He had also acquired a native\r\nwoman, who, in accordance with one of the innumerable customs, could\r\nnot call him by name at all. She referred to him as Kotasa, which is a\r\nsort of title. He, also in accordance with customs, called her Shallra,\r\nwhich was not her name, but that of her mother. Grady was also\r\nextremely careful not to speak to her mother at all, because of another\r\ncustom.\r\n\r\nGrady--Kotasa to his wife, and Shassa to the rest of the\r\nvillage--fitted in well, better than any Terran had until his coming.\r\nGrady had spent most of his life living in odd places and with strange\r\npeople; and had come to the conclusion that it was always a good\r\nidea to be a conservative by local standards. He could recall, quite\r\nclearly, the day he had found what was left of Steynert, who had tried\r\nto change the dietary habits of the inhabitants of Kree.\r\n\r\nBy comparison with the Kree, the Kya were an easy people to get along\r\nwith. Their lives were not hard, since Pru\'ut was a fertile world, and\r\nfull of food sources. The Kya farmed their garden patches, fished, and\r\nhunted, and spent the remaining time gathering plants for Grady and\r\nreciting endless and complex genealogies. Grady paid for the plants\r\nwith goods from the trade warehouse, and listened gravely to the\r\ngenealogies, making mental notes whenever anything was mentioned that\r\nmight be of practical use. He did not consider himself as a collector\r\nof scientific information; he was a practical man, and he selected\r\ninformation for practical ends.\r\n\r\nShallra was the best wife he had ever had, and Grady had lived\r\non several worlds. She spoke little, and when she did, it was\r\ndirect and to the point. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
She was affectionate, but, like most Kya,\r\nundemonstrative. She had been brought up to consider that males were\r\nequals, but that certain male privileges, such as the lodge magics and\r\nthe use of horn pipes, were inviolable. Grady had lived on one world\r\nwhere men were considered very much superior to women, and had found\r\nthat the attitudes which result are not as pleasant as they might seem.\r\nAnd lastly, Shallra was probably the best cook on Pru\'ut, if not the\r\nbest on several worlds.\r\n\r\nThe Kya generally liked and trusted Grady, and, after two years, he\r\nwas almost one of them. Standing on the agency porch, in the weak\r\nsunlight, he seemed to have acquired the same yellowish skin and lean\r\nface, and he was dressed in the same loose kilt. Shallra came out to\r\nstand beside him, and they looked like any other Kya.\r\n\r\n"The sun," she said gravely. "There will be a dance tonight."\r\n\r\nGrady nodded. "Like to see it," he said. "The dance, I mean."\r\n\r\n"It is for men," Shallra said. "Koor," she pointed at the sun, "is a\r\ngod belonging to men. The women dance when the sky clears in the night."\r\n\r\n"Men\'s dance, eh?" Grady said, sucking on his pipe. "You\'re probably\r\nright about it being all right for me to go. But I\'d better check with\r\nthe Chief anyway."\r\n\r\nHe started down the log-paved walk, toward the Chief\'s house on the\r\nother side of the village. He could see it clearly at the far end of\r\nthe long, muddy street, but it was necessary to walk along a twisting\r\ndetour, rather than directly toward it. There was an acre of ground in\r\nthe center of the village, filled with crumbling, empty huts, and no\r\nKya walked through this ground. It belonged to Sa\'ahah, whose ghost\r\nwalked in a wide circle around the hut where a jealous rival had\r\nspeared him in his sleep.\r\n\r\nThe house was the usual Kya affair, on tall stilts, with painted\r\nsigns on its facade, but much more elaborate as befitted the Chief\'s\r\nposition. He was Anla-Who-Speaks-for-the-Ancestors. There were several\r\nother kinds of chief, but it was Anla whom Grady consulted before\r\ntrying anything in the least unusual. Anla sat on his porch now,\r\nregarding the sun through slitted eyes.\r\n\r\nGrady greeted him in proper form, and Anla returned the greeting,\r\nrising and bowing.\r\n\r\n"Is there any reason why this person may not attend the dance of Koor\r\nwith his brothers on this night?" Grady asked.\r\n\r\nAnla thoughtfully pulled his lower lip; then, nodding, he said, "No,\r\nthere is no reason not to."\r\n\r\nThen Grady made the mistake. He made it in full view of Anla\'s\r\nmother-in-law, who sat peering balefully out from her special room in\r\nthe corner of the Chief\'s house; and of Anla\'s wife, and of his wife\'s\r\ninnumerable relations, who were clustered on the porch. When Grady saw\r\ntheir silent staring, he looked down at his feet, and he saw what it\r\nwas that he had done. Anla saw it too, and the two men looked up again,\r\nand at each other, very gravely.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGrady did not say he was sorry. It would have been of no use whatever.\r\nNor did he point out that the sun came out so infrequently that his\r\nmistake was one which could be excused. Among the Kya there are very\r\nfew mistakes which can be excused, and stepping on the shadow of a\r\nchief is not one of them.\r\n\r\nNeither did Anla make any reference to the long friendship between\r\nthem, because there would have been no point in doing so. Anla\'s eyes\r\ngrew darker, and the wrinkles at their corners deepened, but his words\r\nwere calm, the correct words for such a time.\r\n\r\n"Your name was Shassa," Anla said. "You have broken the ghost-cloak of\r\nthe Chief, and your name cannot be Shassa. From this place and this\r\ntime I take back your name, Shassa, and you have no name."\r\n\r\nGrady did not say anything, because a Kya cannot hear the words of a\r\nman without a name; besides, there was nothing to say, though a great\r\ndeal to think about. The _Berenice_ was due in four days. Four days\r\nduring which a man without a name would have to avoid the custom which\r\ndecreed that such a man must be killed. Killed as soon as possible,\r\nbecause each day he continued to live was a day which must be removed\r\nfrom the calendar, a day on which no man\'s birth date might be\r\ncelebrated, or any animal killed for food, or any root taken from a\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\nGrady turned, and walked slowly, with a stiff back, down the path\r\naway from the Chief\'s house. To run, or to show fear, would be fatal;\r\nthe Kya were themselves in a state of shock at the thing which had\r\nhappened, and it would be an hour or more before they began to prepare\r\nfor what they had to do. Therefore, Grady held his spine straight,\r\nfeeling a cold spot between his shoulderblades where the first\r\niron-headed arrow might strike in.\r\n\r\nAhead of him, through the village, the silent children ran on light\r\nfeet, darting into the houses and out again--the children, who were the\r\nbearers of news. He saw three of them dash toward the agency, and enter\r\nit; and in a moment, as he came up the path, Shallra came out on the\r\nporch, carrying a clay pot in her hands.\r\n\r\n"You who were Kotasa," she said, "take this, and drink it to free me of\r\nyour name."\r\n\r\nIt was the standard form of divorce among the Kya, and if the eyes of\r\nShallra had not been bright with tears, Grady might have slipped. He\r\ntook the clay pot, but he did not drink, because he could smell the\r\nfaint and bitter odor about it, which was not the odor of the fruit\r\nwine that it should have held.\r\n\r\n"Why?" he asked her, quietly.\r\n\r\n"Because it is an easier death than the knife and the arrow," she said,\r\nand added, "When you were Kotasa, you were--a good man for me. Drink\r\nthe wine." She said it pleadingly. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
He shook his head.\r\n\r\n"I am sorry," Shallra said, and there is nothing harder for a Kya to\r\nsay. But she added something even harder for a Kya woman to say; his\r\nname, his proper name, which she had always known but could never use.\r\nThen she walked away, and out of Grady\'s life, because he was now a man\r\nwithout a name.\r\n\r\nHe set the pot down carefully on the agency\'s steps and went inside. As\r\nhe closed the door, there was a high, whistling noise, and a sharp thud\r\nagainst the door planks. He did not need to look to know that an arrow\r\nstood in its wooden panels.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGrady closed the heavy wooden shutters carefully, not even jumping when\r\na second arrow whickered through the last shutter as it swung. He lit\r\na table lamp and took the heavy, seldom-used rifle from the wall. He\r\ndid not need to check it; he had oiled and cleaned it once a week for\r\ntwo years. Instead, he laid it on the table and took a book down from a\r\nshelf.\r\n\r\n"General Code of the Federation Authority," Grady read the words on the\r\nspine, and opened it. "Extent of responsibilities of individuals on\r\nmandated planets...."\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances, Grady discovered, he could kill any number of\r\nKya if he were so inclined. The Authority would require a full report,\r\nin quadruplicate, of the circumstances--and as another arrow struck the\r\ndoor, Grady wondered wryly who would make out that report.\r\n\r\nAlso, Grady was not in the least inclined to kill any Kya. If doing\r\nso would have saved his life, he would have shot any number of them\r\nwithout any particular qualms. But there were no reasons at all to\r\nthink that killing any of them would do Grady any good. And Grady\r\nthoroughly understood why it was that they had to kill him. He was no\r\nmore angry with the Kya than he had been with the Imperial Guards,\r\nfive years before, when they had come up Kanno Hill with their band\r\nplaying and their bayonets gleaming. He could remember how military\r\nand colorful they had looked, in comparison to the overalled, grimy\r\nrabble who stood beside him; and how they had come up that hill again\r\nand again, fewer of them each time, and the band losing a bit of verve\r\non the last. Grady\'s anger then had been at the damned fool, whoever\r\nhe was, who ordered those useless charges; and his anger now was with\r\nhimself, because it had been his own mistake.\r\n\r\nThere was a growing murmur outside the agency. The villagers were\r\ngathering in the street, and in the yards behind the building. There\r\nwas no way out now, and nowhere to go if there had been a way out.\r\n\r\nGrady got up, and walked to the door. He opened the sliding panel a\r\ncrack and peered out.\r\n\r\nThe rain had begun again, and through its thin gray curtain he could\r\nsee the ranks of villagers, silent, standing around the house, along\r\nthe railings, and watching. The men stood in front, each holding his\r\nweapons, his bow bent in his hands. There was Lahrsha, who had been\r\nbrother in the Lodge to Grady, and whose blood had been mixed with\r\nhis to seal the tribal bond. There was Ahl, whose small son Grady had\r\nnursed through a bad week. There were Grady\'s friends and neighbors and\r\nbrothers, each with an arrow on the nock for Grady.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a queer thing to happen," Grady said to himself, aloud. The sound\r\nof his own voice startled him; he had become so much a Kya that to him\r\na man without a name should not have a voice.\r\n\r\nThe arrows struck oftener now. Grady saw a small group of men move\r\naway, and then return, carrying a short log.\r\n\r\nThe door, Grady thought. They\'ll break it down, and come in, with their\r\ngrave faces and their polite ways, and they\'ll cut my throat. And it\r\nwon\'t matter if I kill one or two or ten of them; they\'ll do it anyway.\r\nThey won\'t hear an argument, because they can\'t hear me at all, without\r\na name; they won\'t even hear any noise I make when they finish me off.\r\n\r\nThe log had begun to beat against the door, with a steady thunder.\r\nGrady opened a cabinet, and took out a jar of brown liquid. Quickly he\r\ndrank it and sat down, his face graying. His head fell forward on his\r\narms, and the book of regulations fell to the floor, atop the unfired\r\nrifle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Berenice_ swung outward, riding home to port with an empty hold.\r\nThe Mallor Company would not be pleased, but there were other jobs. And\r\nthe mate, sitting across the messroom table from James Grady, put the\r\nmatter in its simplest terms.\r\n\r\n"Just one of those things," the mate said. "You can\'t be blamed.\r\nThey\'ll take another agent without any fuss, I imagine."\r\n\r\n"No doubt of it," Grady said. "Can\'t say I\'m glad to leave, though. It\r\nwas a good place."\r\n\r\n"I still don\'t get it," the mate said. "We came in and found you in the\r\nagency, out cold with coca. The door was down, and arrows all over the\r\nplace. Why didn\'t they come in and dig a knife into you?"\r\n\r\n"Customs and taboos," Grady said. "I took a chance on it, but I was\r\npretty sure I was right. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
Common sense--by their standards. Man\'s\r\nasleep--his ghost is walking around. If you kill him in his sleep, you\r\nfree his ghost, which is very bad, very strong magic. So you have to\r\nwake him up to kill him. And they couldn\'t wake me up; I was full of\r\nthat coca leaf, enough for a week."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
