For Louise Haven said, as\r\nsoon as the Centaurian porters had taken their baggage at the starport\r\nwith cold, aloof correctness:\r\n\r\n"Why, George! They don\'t seem to like you. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
I thought you would be a\r\nhero to them, from what you told me."\r\n\r\nGeorge Haven said nothing. He was a big, powerful-looking man in his\r\nlate thirties. He was expensively dressed and he had taken the most\r\nexpensive suite in Alpha City\'s best hotel and he had an expensive,\r\nyoung, and beautiful wife.\r\n\r\nHe thought: Today I\'m one of the most powerful men in the stellar\r\nconfederacy. What does she expect, that I\'ll win a popularity contest\r\ntoo? Well, I guess she\'ll learn eventually what makes an important man\r\ntruly important. Could you sum it up in a word, in a single clearly\r\nunderstood word? 

=== Chunk 3 ===
he wondered. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
He decided that you could. The word was\r\nruthless.\r\n\r\nThey swept into the hotel with their train of attendants and were\r\nreceived with the same aloof correctness. Haven watched with\r\nsatisfaction while Louise removed her Sirian furs. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Louise was something\r\nto look at, all right, but so were the furs. They\'d cost Haven plenty\r\nand there was probably a trail of blood and tears behind them on Sirius\r\nIII, for the animals whose coats they were, Haven knew, were ferocious.\r\n\r\nIt was very cold outside, as it always was on Centauri VII. The small,\r\nblue-skinned hotel manager said, in crisp, perfect English:\r\n\r\n"The others are already here, Mr. Haven. They are waiting."\r\n\r\nOf course the others had already arrived, Haven thought. You had to\r\nkeep people waiting. Let them know their own importance didn\'t add up\r\nto a hill of beans.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a beautiful suite, George," Louise Haven said after they had\r\ntaken the pneumotube to their floor and entered their suite through the\r\nirising door. "At least the Centaurians saved the best for us."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll always get the best for you, baby," Haven said, and took\r\nthis beautiful young woman who had been his wife for exactly two\r\nmonths--long enough to reach Centauri--into his arms and kissed her.\r\n\r\nWas there something unexpectedly stiff and cold about Louise\'s\r\nresponse? Haven did not know; he wondered if he had imagined it. Was\r\nthe coldly correct behavior of the Centaurians getting on his nerves?\r\n\r\n"You know," Louise said breathlessly, "it\'s still a little hard\r\nto realize I\'m married to a legend. Mrs. George Haven. Mrs.\r\nMost-Important-Man-in-the-Galaxy. And it\'s even harder to believe you\r\ngot your start right here on Centauri VII. Tell me about it, George."\r\n\r\n"Man\'s got to get his start somewhere," Haven said, surprised that it\r\nsounded defensive. "Besides, that\'s why we\'ve come to Centauri."\r\n\r\nIt was--and it wasn\'t. Haven\'s first big success, almost fifteen years\r\nago, had been here on cold, bleak Centauri VII. Haven and a man named\r\nDrexell Tolliver--who had died here in Centauri--had discovered a\r\nuranium mine which had dwarfed all the remaining lodes on Earth. With\r\nthat discovery as a stepping-off point, Haven now owned some fifty\r\npercent of all the producing uranium mines in the stellar confederacy.\r\nAnd since stellar civilization was an atomic civilization, Haven could\r\nbuy and sell politicians across the length and breadth of the inhabited\r\ngalaxy.\r\n\r\nBut, he thought now as Louise went into the next room to prepare for\r\nthe reunion party with the Earthmen and Centaurians who had worked\r\nunder Haven and Drexell Tolliver fifteen years ago, he hadn\'t been\r\nable to buy as much as a porter on Centauri VII. Damn them! 

=== Chunk 6 ===
he thought\r\nfor the hundredth time. Damn the fantastically decadent Centaurians,\r\nanyway! They never told lies. It was biologically--or psychologically,\r\nhe didn\'t know which--impossible for a Centaurian to tell a lie. On\r\nthe other hand, Haven remembered from bitter experience, a Centaurian\r\ncould refuse to answer you altogether. That was usually their way out.\r\nThey were the most close-lipped people in the galaxy. There were no\r\ncourts of law on Centauri: there could not be, for no one would testify\r\nagainst anyone else. The only retributive system they had was that of\r\nvendetta. It almost seemed incredible to Haven that Centauri VII had\r\nbeen admitted into the stellar confederacy at all.\r\n\r\nHaven showered and dressed and wondered about the reunion. It had been\r\nhis own idea. For here on Centauri was the one mistake which could\r\nruin Haven, here where there were no politicians to be bought. The\r\nthought of it had weighed on Haven for fifteen years. It seemed safely\r\nhid, his secret. Hadn\'t fifteen years elapsed? But still, there was no\r\npredicting the Centaurians. No predicting them at all.\r\n\r\nThe reunion was a necessity, assuming Haven had to come. For, if you\r\ncouldn\'t buy Centaurians, you could at least buy Earthmen. And Haven\r\nmight need help.\r\n\r\nHe chuckled. He hadn\'t seen anything of these men for fifteen years,\r\nbut he\'d been paying them off regularly, like clockwork. Blackmail?\r\nIt was hardly blackmail. Haven knew what they knew. Haven had offered\r\nthem money almost from the beginning, and all of them had accepted.\r\nRuthless, Haven thought again. In their own small way, these half dozen\r\nmen were ruthless, too. Failures in life, of course, except for the\r\nmoney Haven paid them every month. But ruthless.\r\n\r\n"Ready, George?" Louise asked.\r\n\r\nHaven looked her up and down slowly. She was ravishingly beautiful. She\r\nwas George Haven\'s property. He had made her what she was. He didn\'t\r\neven know her background, had purposely not delved into it. Forget\r\nabout the past, he\'d told her on the eve of their marriage. It\'s the\r\nfuture which counts. The future....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"The future!" toasted Allen Vorhees, lifting his glass of Centaurian\r\nliquor. "To all our futures."\r\n\r\nThe six Earthmen who knew Haven\'s secret drank with secret smiles. The\r\nsmiles were for Louise--Louise who apparently knew nothing, Louise who\r\nlooked up to her husband with the blind faith of a naive young girl.\r\n\r\nHaven raised his own glass. "May the future treat all of you as well\r\nas the past fifteen years have," he said, and drank. The smiles faded\r\naround the table. They\'d drink to that, all right, Haven thought. But\r\nthey didn\'t like the idea.\r\n\r\nA Centaurian waiter shuffled in with the first dinner course. Haven\r\nfelt a mounting impatience. He wished the banquet was over already.\r\nHe wished he could start planning what he had to do. He\'d come to\r\nCentauri with no specific plan. He only knew that Drexell Tolliver\'s\r\nfifteen-years-frozen corpse was still waiting here on Centauri VII, to\r\nruin him someday if he wasn\'t careful. Yes, Haven thought. I killed\r\nhim. I murdered Drexell Tolliver. But it was for the good of the whole\r\ngalaxy, couldn\'t they see that? Tolliver was an idealist, had wanted\r\nto give the huge uranium lode as a gift to the decadent Centaurians,\r\nwho once had possessed a fine atomic civilization but had lost it a\r\nthousand years before Earthmen took to the stars. Then Drexell Tolliver\r\nsaid they could lease the mine back and work it. The galaxy would get\r\nits uranium, Centauri VII would get much-needed galactic credits, and\r\nthe partnership of Tolliver-Haven would still run the mine.\r\n\r\nBut this way, the way it worked out, thought Haven, the galaxy gets\r\nall the uranium from me. The whims of the strange Centaurians didn\'t\r\nmatter. It was for the good of the galaxy, wasn\'t it? Haven smiled,\r\nremembering. Galaxy, hell. Why didn\'t he admit it, at least to himself?\r\nIt was for the good of George Haven. And in the process, in bringing\r\nabout that good, Drexell Tolliver had had to die.\r\n\r\n"... go out and visit the old mines," Angus MacCready was saying.\r\n\r\nThe last course was served. Vorhees suggested they could start for\r\nthe mines in the morning, and they all agreed. Even Louise seemed\r\nfascinated by the idea, and this surprised Haven. Louise had never\r\nshowed much interest in his enterprises--except, now that he thought of\r\nit, for the Centaurian mine.\r\n\r\nOut there, Haven thought. A hundred miles from nowhere in the high ice\r\nmountains north of this city, there is a glacier. The ice is crystal\r\nclear, astonishing clear. And there, entrapped in the ice and perfectly\r\npreserved by it for all time and perfectly visible too, was Drexell\r\nTolliver\'s body. Haven had, fifteen years before, melted the ice with\r\na heat blaster and dropped Tolliver\'s body in. Then the ice had frozen\r\nover. For fifteen years, except when it snowed--and it did not snow\r\noften, despite the cold, on Centauri VII--the corpse had been perfectly\r\nvisible for whoever wanted to see it. Fortunately, the viewers had only\r\nbeen Centaurians, and the Centaurians never bore testimony against one\r\nanother, nor against outworlders, either.\r\n\r\nNow he had to reach that body, had to hide it some way, with the help\r\nof these six men he\'d been paying off for fifteen years because they\'d\r\nbeen working for him and Tolliver and knew what he knew....\r\n\r\n"I\'d just love to go out there," he heard Louise saying.\r\n\r\n"No, Louise," he said firmly. "I don\'t think you\'d like it. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Cold.\r\nNothing to see, really. Why don\'t you just stay in the hotel when we\r\nget started in the morning?"\r\n\r\n"But I insist," Louise said, smiling at him sweetly.\r\n\r\n"Let the little lady go," MacCready said, smiling blandly.\r\n\r\nBefore Haven could answer, the little Centaurian waiter came by.\r\n"Glacier move," he mumbled.\r\n\r\n"What did you say?" said Haven, startled.\r\n\r\n"Nothing," said the Centaurian, and shuffled from the room. Haven got\r\nup and started after him, but saw Louise watching. He settled back and\r\nwaited uncomfortably through the small talk of the reunion. It did not\r\nbreak up until the early hours of the morning and Haven went directly\r\nto their suite with Louise.\r\n\r\n"No nightcap?" she asked him.\r\n\r\n"Need plenty of sleep for the morning. But Lou, honey, I still don\'t\r\nthink you ought to go."\r\n\r\n"I\'m going, George. That\'s all. It\'s the beginning of the George Haven\r\nlegend, and I want to see it. Can you blame me?

=== Chunk 8 ===
"\r\n\r\nHaven had to admit that he could not. They went up to the suite, where\r\nHaven undressed and got into bed and pretended to fall asleep quickly.\r\nAfter what seemed a very long time to him he heard Louise\'s regular\r\nbreathing.\r\n\r\n"Sleeping honey?" he whispered.\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\nHaven got up quietly and dressed in the dark. He tiptoed to the door,\r\nlooked back once, listened. Louise was still breathing regularly. Even\r\nbefore the reunion celebration was over, Haven had made up his mind. If\r\nLouise was going out there with him and the others in the morning--and\r\napparently she was--then Haven had to go out there first, in the\r\ndarkness, alone if necessary, to see what he could do about the body....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe closed the door softly behind him and stepped into the dim,\r\nnight-lit hallway. He almost bumped into a small figure crouching there\r\nand jerked away from it with a startled exclamation.\r\n\r\nIt was the little Centaurian waiter.\r\n\r\nHaven grabbed the collar of his tunic. "All right," he said. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
"All\r\nright, you\'re just the man I\'m looking for. What did you mean, glacier\r\nmove?"\r\n\r\n"Glacier move. You know. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
You know!" The Centaurian offered a tentative\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n"No, damn you, I don\'t know!" Haven whispered furiously, dragging the\r\nCentaurian into the stairwell.\r\n\r\n"Glacier on mine then. Glacier not on mine now. All city know."\r\n\r\n"Then where is it?"\r\n\r\n"Glacier is river of ice. Glacier flow. Glacier one, two miles from\r\ncity now."\r\n\r\n"_That_ glacier?" demanded Haven, horrified at the thought that Drexell\r\nTolliver\'s body was within a mile or two of five million people, even\r\nif they were Centaurians.\r\n\r\n"That glacier, yes."\r\n\r\n"Take me there," commanded Haven, all but strangling the little\r\nCentaurian with his big hands.\r\n\r\n"I take you," the blue man managed. His azure skin had gone a pale sky\r\nblue with fright. They\'re all the same, thought Haven. If you can\'t buy\r\nthem you can scare the hell out of them.\r\n\r\n"Then let\'s get started," Haven said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA team of six-legged creatures drew the ice-sled silently through the\r\nnight. They climbed steadily into the ice hills. Centauri had set, but\r\nlittle Proxima, Centauri VII\'s tiny second sun, was on the horizon and\r\ngave dusky light perhaps twice the brightness of Earth night at full\r\nmoon. The little waiter, whose name Haven didn\'t know, drove the team\r\nin utter silence. The runners slid across the ice with scrapings and\r\nwhisperings. The long, surprisingly bright night shadows fled before\r\nthem. Haven was wrapped to the ears in furs and it was cold here in\r\nthe ice hills, but he sweated with impatience. Sure, he told himself.\r\nYou\'ll find the body. You\'ll see the body. But what will you do then.\r\n\r\nIt took hardly more than moments to reach the huge, amazingly\r\ntransparent glacier. Fifteen years, thought Haven. Fifteen years is\r\nnothing to this river of ice. Fifteen hundred years--and it will still\r\nhold Drexell Tolliver\'s body, perfectly preserved. Drexell Tolliver\'s\r\nbody, the wound inflicted by Haven\'s knife, the knife still there, in\r\nthe dead man\'s side with Haven\'s fingerprints on the haft because for\r\nthe first and only time in his life Haven had been frightened and thus\r\ncareless....\r\n\r\nHaven climbed off the sled and carefully skirted the upper edge of the\r\ncrevasse he remembered so well. The bottom was in shadow. It was two\r\nhundred feet down, certainly, if not more. Haven shuddered. It would\r\nhave been so easy for a man to slip. Why hadn\'t he thought of that,\r\nfifteen years ago? The crevasse had been here. He could have pushed\r\nTolliver, instead of knifing him.\r\n\r\nThe waiter led the way at a brisk pace, his animal-pad-soled boots\r\nholding on the slick ice, as Haven\'s did. Finally, the waiter held up\r\nhis hand:\r\n\r\n"Here," he said. "Here Tolliver."\r\n\r\n"You know?" Haven gasped. He had never doubted it for a minute, but\r\nsomehow the two words--here Tolliver--had nevertheless startled him.\r\n\r\n"All Alpha City know," said the native, stepping aside as Haven peered\r\ndown through the utterly clear ice.\r\n\r\nThe body seemed very small and lonely and far away. It was there as it\r\nhad been there and as it always would be there and as it had haunted\r\nHaven\'s sleep for fifteen years.\r\n\r\nHaven probed his mind for ideas. There had to be something....\r\n\r\nA heat blaster, he thought. I can go back to town and get a heat\r\nblaster and melt it free again and then--\r\n\r\nBut the little native had to die. True, he was only one of millions who\r\nhad apparently seen the body, but he had taken Haven here, and if ever\r\nhe could be brought to a stellar confederacy court to testify, and if\r\nit could be proved that the site of the mine, fifteen years ago, had\r\nbeen galactic and not Centaurian territory, and if he could be made to\r\ntestify because, after all, he was not on Centauri and not subject to\r\nthe Centaurian mores, then Haven was finished.\r\n\r\nHaven removed the hand-stunner from his furs and pointed it at the\r\nnative\'s back.\r\n\r\n"Hold it, George! Don\'t move!

=== Chunk 11 ===
"\r\n\r\nHe dropped the gun in his surprise. It was Louise\'s voice.\r\n\r\nRunners slid whisperingly across the ice. A sled came up. Louise stood\r\nin it, a stunner in her own hand. She looked at him as the sled came to\r\na stop. Her face was grim.\r\n\r\n"Louise," Haven said accusingly. "You followed me from the hotel. But\r\nwhy--why?"\r\n\r\n"Because I had to find out what you had to find out. Because you told\r\nme to be ruthless, George, remember? You always told me you had to be\r\nruthless to get anyplace. So I was ruthless too. I married you."\r\n\r\n"Ruthless--marrying me? I don\'t understand."\r\n\r\n"You never looked into my past, George. That suited me fine. 

=== Chunk 12 ===
Well, come\r\non. Get on this sled now! I\'m taking you back to Alpha City. We\'re\r\ngetting in touch with the Galactic representative to see if you can be\r\nindicted for Drexell Tolliver\'s murder."\r\n\r\n"But you--"\r\n\r\nJust then the small native came up with Haven\'s stunner. "You came\r\nalmost too late, Miss Tolliver," he said.\r\n\r\nTolliver, thought Haven. Tolliver! "Tolliver!" he shouted, and his\r\nvoice echoed from the ice hills and came back, boomingly, to him.\r\n"Tolliver!"\r\n\r\nAnd calmly, Louise told him: "I am Drexell Tolliver\'s daughter. You\r\nfool, George. 

=== Chunk 13 ===
You fool. The others were here, but they never knew.\r\nNot Vorhees, not MacCready, not any of them. Sure, they took your\r\nmoney. They were curious, but why should they say no? You built the\r\nwhole thing up in your mind. It was your own private nightmare. You\r\nnever would have been found out if you hadn\'t come here. If you hadn\'t\r\ndreamed up this reunion, if you hadn\'t married Drexell Tolliver\'s\r\ndaughter."\r\n\r\nHaven heard her voice, but hardly heard the words. He began to run.\r\nSoon he was running very fast. He did not look back. He heard the\r\nbark of her stunner and saw the raw streaks of energy rip by him in\r\nthe night. Run, he thought. You have to run now. You never had to run\r\nbefore, but you can do anything you have to do, can\'t you?\r\n\r\nHe ran faster and faster. The night and the ice swept by. This time\r\nhe did not see the crevasse. He ran right up to the lip without a\r\nsound, into the death-trap he should have prepared for Drexell Tolliver\r\nfifteen years before.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
