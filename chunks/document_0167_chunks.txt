]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                This is how it all began--the terrible\r\n                civil strife that devastates our world!\r\n\r\n\r\n    Based in material in Ch. 7--"First Clashes of the Wheeled and\r\n    Footed Sects"--of Vol. 3 of Burger\'s monumental _History of\r\n    Traffic_, published by the Foundation for Twenty-Second\r\n    Century Studies.\r\n\r\nThe raggedy little old lady with the big shopping bag was in the exact\r\ncenter of the crosswalk when she became aware of the big black car\r\nbearing down on her.\r\n\r\nBehind the thick bullet-proof glass its seven occupants had a misty\r\nlook, like men in a diving bell.\r\n\r\nShe saw there was no longer time to beat the car to either curb.\r\nVeering remorselessly, it would catch her in the gutter.\r\n\r\nUseless to attempt a feint and double-back, such as any venturesome\r\nchild executed a dozen times a day. Her reflexes were too slow.\r\n\r\nPolite vacuous laughter came from the car\'s loudspeaker over the\r\nengine\'s mounting roar.\r\n\r\nFrom her fellow pedestrians lining the curbs came a sigh of horror.\r\n\r\nThe little old lady dipped into her shopping bag and came up with a big\r\nblue-black automatic. She held it in both fists, riding the recoils\r\nlike a rodeo cowboy on a bucking bronco.\r\n\r\nAiming at the base of the windshield, just as a big-game hunter aims\r\nat the vulnerable spine of a charging water buffalo over the horny\r\narmor of its lowered head, the little old lady squeezed off three shots\r\nbefore the car chewed her down.\r\n\r\nFrom the right-hand curb a young woman in a wheelchair shrieked an\r\nobscenity at the car\'s occupants.\r\n\r\nSmythe-de Winter, the driver, wasn\'t happy. The little old lady\'s\r\nlast shot had taken two members of his car pool. Bursting through the\r\nlaminated glass, the steel-jacketed slug had traversed the neck of\r\nPhipps-McHeath and buried itself in the skull of Horvendile-Harker.\r\n\r\nBraking viciously, Smythe-de Winter rammed the car over the right-hand\r\ncurb. Pedestrians scattered into entries and narrow arcades, among them\r\na youth bounding high on crutches.\r\n\r\nBut Smythe-de Winter got the girl in the wheelchair.\r\n\r\nThen he drove rapidly out of the Slum Ring into the Suburbs, a shred\r\nof rattan swinging from the flange of his right fore mudguard for\r\na trophy. Despite the two-for-two casualty list, he felt angry and\r\ndepressed. The secure, predictable world around him seemed to be\r\ncrumbling.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile his companions softly keened a dirge to Horvy and Phipps and\r\nquietly mopped up their blood, he frowned and shook his head.\r\n\r\n"They oughtn\'t to let old ladies carry magnums," he murmured.\r\n\r\nWitherspoon-Hobbs nodded agreement across the front-seat corpse. "They\r\noughtn\'t to let \'em carry anything.

God, how I hate Feet," he muttered,\r\nlooking down at his shrunken legs. "Wheels forever!" he softly cheered.\r\n\r\nThe incident had immediate repercussions throughout the city. At the\r\ncombined wake of the little old lady and the girl in the wheelchair,\r\na fiery-tongued speaker inveighed against the White-Walled Fascists\r\nof Suburbia, telling to his hearers, the fabled wonders of old Los\r\nAngeles, where pedestrians were sacrosanct, even outside crosswalks. He\r\ncalled for a hobnail march across the nearest lawn-bowling alleys and\r\nperambulator-traversed golf courses of the motorists.\r\n\r\nAt the Sunnyside Crematorium, to which the bodies of Phipps and Horvy\r\nhad been conveyed, an equally impassioned and rather more grammatical\r\norator reminded his listeners of the legendary justice of old Chicago,\r\nwhere pedestrians were forbidden to carry small arms and anyone with\r\none foot off the sidewalk was fair prey. He broadly hinted that a\r\nholocaust, primed if necessary with a few tankfuls of gasoline, was the\r\nonly cure for the Slums.\r\n\r\nBands of skinny youths came loping at dusk out of the Slum Ring into\r\nthe innermost sections of the larger doughnut of the Suburbs slashing\r\ndefenseless tires, shooting expensive watchdogs and scrawling filthy\r\nwords on the pristine panels of matrons\' runabouts which never ventured\r\nmore than six blocks from home.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously squadrons of young suburban motorcycles and scooterites\r\nroared through the outermost precincts of the Slum Ring, harrying\r\nchildren off sidewalks, tossing stink-bombs through second-story\r\ntenement windows and defacing hovel-fronts with sprays of black paint.\r\n\r\nIncident--a thrown brick, a cut corner, monster tacks in the portico\r\nof the Auto Club--were even reported from the center of the city,\r\ntraditionally neutral territory.\r\n\r\nThe Government hurriedly acted, suspending all traffic between the\r\nCenter and the Suburbs and establishing a 24-hour curfew in the Slum\r\nRing. Government agents moved only by centipede-car and pogo-hopper to\r\nunderline the point that they favored neither contending side.\r\n\r\nThe day of enforced non-movement for Feet and Wheels was spent in\r\nfurtive vengeful preparations. Behind locked garage doors, machine-guns\r\nthat fired through the nose ornament were mounted under hoods, illegal\r\nscythe blades were welded to oversize hubcaps and the stainless steel\r\nedges of flange fenders were honed to razor sharpness.\r\n\r\nWhile nervous National Guardsmen hopped about the deserted sidewalks of\r\nthe Slum Ring, grim-faced men and women wearing black armbands moved\r\nthrough the webwork of secret tunnels and hidden doors, distributing\r\nheavy-caliber small arms and spike-studded paving blocks, piling\r\ncobblestones on strategic roof-tops and sapping upward from the secret\r\ntunnels to create car-traps. Children got ready to soap intersections\r\nafter dark. The Committee of Pedestrian Safety, sometimes known as\r\nRobespierre\'s Rats, prepared to release its two carefully hoarded\r\nanti-tank guns.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt nightfall, under the tireless urging of the Government,\r\nrepresentatives of the Pedestrians and the Motorists met on a huge\r\nsafety island at the boundary of the Slum Ring and the Suburbs.\r\n\r\nUnderlings began a noisy dispute as to whether Smythe-de Winter had\r\nfailed to give a courtesy honk before charging, whether the little old\r\nlady had opened fire before the car had come within honking distance,\r\nhow many wheels of Smythe-de\'s car had been on the sidewalk when he hit\r\nthe girl in the wheelchair and so on. After a little while the High\r\nPedestrian and the Chief Motorist exchanged cautious winks and drew\r\naside.\r\n\r\nThe red writhing of a hundred kerosene flares and the mystic yellow\r\npulsing of a thousand firefly lamps mounted on yellow sawhorses ranged\r\naround the safety island illumined two tragic, strained faces.\r\n\r\n"A word before we get down to business," the Chief Motorist whispered.\r\n"What\'s the current S.Q. of your adults?

"\r\n\r\n"Forty-one and dropping," the High Pedestrian replied, his eyes\r\nfearfully searching from side to side for eavesdroppers. "I can hardly\r\nget aides who are halfway _compos mentis_."\r\n\r\n"Our own Sanity Quotient is thirty-seven," the Chief Motorist revealed.\r\nHe shrugged helplessly.... "The wheels inside my people\'s heads are\r\nslowing down. I do not think they will be speeded up in my lifetime."\r\n\r\n"They say Government\'s only fifty-two," the other said with a matching\r\nshrug.\r\n\r\n"Well, I suppose we must scrape out one more compromise," the one\r\nsuggested hollowly, "though I must confess there are times when I think\r\nwe\'re all the figments of a paranoid\'s dream."\r\n\r\nTwo hours of concentrated deliberations produced the new Wheel-Foot\r\nArticles of Agreement. Among other points, pedestrian handguns were\r\nlimited to a slightly lower muzzle velocity and to .38 caliber and\r\nunder, while motorists were required to give three honks at one block\r\ndistance before charging a pedestrian in a crosswalk. Two wheels over\r\nthe curb changed a traffic kill from third-degree manslaughter to petty\r\nhomicide. Blind pedestrians were permitted to carry hand grenades.\r\n\r\nImmediately the Government went to work. The new Wheel-Foot Articles\r\nwere loudspeakered and posted. Detachments of police and psychiatric\r\nsocial hoppers centipedaled and pogoed through the Slum Ring, seizing\r\noutsize weapons and giving tranquilizing jet-injections to the unruly.\r\nTeams of hypnotherapists and mechanics scuttled from home to home\r\nin the Suburbs and from garage to garage, in-chanting a conformist\r\nserenity and stripping illegal armament from cars. On the advice of\r\na rogue psychiatrist, who said it would channel off aggressions, a\r\ndisplay of bull-fighting was announced, but this had to be canceled\r\nwhen a strong protest was lodged by the Decency League, which had a\r\nlarge mixed Wheel-Foot membership.\r\n\r\nAt dawn, curfew was lifted in the Slum Ring and traffic reopened\r\nbetween the Suburbs and the Center. After a few uneasy moments it\r\nbecame apparent that the _status quo_ had been restored.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSmythe-de Winter tooled his gleaming black machine along the Ring. A\r\nthick steel bolt with a large steel washer on either side neatly filled\r\nthe hole the little old lady\'s slug had made in the windshield.\r\n\r\nA brick bounced off the roof. Bullets pattered against the side\r\nwindows.\r\n\r\nSmythe-de ran a handkerchief around his neck under his collar and\r\nsmiled.\r\n\r\nA block ahead children were darting into the street, cat-calling and\r\nthumbing their noses. Behind one of them limped a fat dog with a spiked\r\ncollar.\r\n\r\nSmythe-de suddenly gunned his motor. He didn\'t hit any of the children,\r\nbut he got the dog.\r\n\r\nA flashing light on the dash showed him the right front tire was losing\r\npressure. Must have hit the collar as well! He thumbed the matching\r\nemergency-air button and the flashing stopped.\r\n\r\nHe turned toward Witherspoon-Hobbs and said with thoughtful\r\nsatisfaction, "I like a normal orderly world, where you always have a\r\nlittle success, but not champagne-heady; a little failure, but just\r\nenough to brace you."\r\n\r\nWitherspoon-Hobbs was squinting at the next crosswalk. Its center was\r\ndiscolored by a brownish stain ribbon-tracked by tires.\r\n\r\n"That\'s where you bagged the little old lady, Smythe-de," he remarked.\r\n"I\'ll say this for her now: she had spirit."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that\'s where I bagged her," Smythe-de agreed flatly. He\r\nremembered wistfully the witchlike face growing rapidly larger, her\r\njerking shoulders in black bombazine, the wild white-circled eyes. He\r\nsuddenly found himself feeling that this was a very dull day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
