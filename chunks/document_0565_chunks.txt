Especially when the elevator was stuck\r\nbetween two floors. But the thing was handled quite casually. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
And with\r\ngood reason. After all, when a thing is not understood the best defense\r\nagainst acknowledging ignorance is to insist that nothing extraordinary\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\nIn this case, four persons, a girl and three men, stepped into an\r\nelevator in the Kendall Building. They were all headed for the same\r\nsuite--offices occupied by several medical men. The elevator jammed\r\nbetween the sixth and seventh floors and refused to budge.\r\n\r\nThe operator, a salty little Brooklynite, swore quietly to himself\r\nand pushed the emergency signal. It rang but nothing happened. The\r\noperator waited for a few minutes, then spoke in a carefully casual\r\nvoice, "The blessed engineer is out to supper. Now ain\'t that the way\r\nthings always happen? When the blessed engineer goes out to supper the\r\nblessed elevator does a blessed sit-down between two floors."\r\n\r\n"What--what are we going to do?" This from the very pretty female\r\npassenger named Peggy Wilson who was afraid of almost everything and\r\nwas going to a psychiatrist who was trying to root a dominating mother\r\nout of the poor girl\'s subconscious and put the old lady back in her\r\ngrave where she belonged.\r\n\r\n"We aren\'t in any danger, miss. We could wait for the engineer but it\r\nmight be quite a while."\r\n\r\n"It looks to me as though we\'ll have to wait for him," Walter\r\nMaltby said. Maltby was an ingrown little man who had had a toothache\r\nfor three weeks and had finally been driven to the dentist by his\r\ndominating wife.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no. If one of you guys--men--will boost me through the trap in the\r\nroof of the car, I can get to the seventh floor door. I\'ll crawl out\r\nand go down in the basement and move the blessed car to seven by hand."\r\n\r\n"Okay," Wilmer Payton said. He was a six-feet-four Greek god with a\r\nbody close to perfection and a handsome, intelligent face that was\r\nnothing more than a spate of false advertising pasted across the front\r\nof a vacant head. Wilmer was pretty much of a mental bankrupt. He\r\ndidn\'t even own the furniture in his own cerebral attic, the pieces\r\nhaving been placed there by others. He had the look of a rising young\r\nexecutive and was the assistant mail room boy in a large publishing\r\ncompany. And a good one, too. Lately, they had been entrusting him with\r\nspecial delivery letters.\r\n\r\nHe braced himself and the operator climbed on his shoulders and\r\nvanished through the ceiling. A moment later there was a sound of an\r\nopening door and a few grunts and scramblings after which the door\r\nclosed and silence again prevailed.\r\n\r\nThe three passengers glanced at each other fearfully. The fourth, a\r\nsmall, white-haired man in his late sixties had stood quietly in one\r\ncorner during the whole procedure. He had a pair of bright black eyes\r\nand a look remindful of an alert fox terrier in a basement known to\r\nhouse rats. He was Fleming Carter, a psychiatrist by profession and a\r\nstudent of almost everything by choice. He was an accomplished linguist\r\namong other things and translated Sanskrit and Hebrew for the pleasure\r\nof it. He was an amateur chemist and also conducted himself ably on a\r\npair of skis.\r\n\r\nSo the quartette was not lacking in brilliance, Fleming Carter having\r\nenough to burnish all four.\r\n\r\nHe had mentally taken his three fellow-prisoners apart and put them\r\ntogether again when he noticed the girl\'s trembling and saw her first\r\ntears. Only then did he step forward.\r\n\r\n"There is no cause for alarm, my dear--none at all. These lifts fairly\r\nbristle with safety devices. The insurance companies demand it."\r\n\r\nPeggy Wilson turned to him gratefully, a little like a kitten, he\r\nthought, which yearned for the reassurance of a soothing hand. _She\r\nwould make a beautiful Persian_, he thought. A perfect house pet.\r\n\r\n"But to be trapped here--like--like animals," Peggy whimpered. "It\'s\r\nterrible!" She was moving toward Fleming Carter\'s shoulder, but Wilmer\r\nPayton took a single step forward and her head turned quite naturally\r\nto _his_ bosom. Fleming Carter smiled and estimated to a nicety the\r\nintelligence of any offspring that would result from a mating of these\r\ntwo vacuums.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all right, baby," Wilmer said. "I\'ll take care of you.

=== Chunk 3 ===
"\r\n\r\nWalter Maltby had troubles of his own. He now voiced them: "Jenny will\r\nbe furious if we don\'t get out of here pretty quick. I\'m always home\r\nfor Television Theater and if I don\'t make it--"\r\n\r\nHe got no further because at that moment the foundations of the world\r\nseemed to give way and the four of them were hurled into a heap on the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nOr were they?\r\n\r\nThis question was in Fleming Carter\'s mind as Peggy Wilson screamed,\r\nWalter Maltby whimpered, and Wilmer Payton bellowed in terror. _Had_\r\nthe lift fallen--the building collapsed--an atom bomb exploded?\r\nHis instincts told him no. This because--while all the outward\r\nmanifestations of such catastrophes seemed apparent--there was\r\nsomething strangely different about the sudden chaos into which the\r\ngroup had been thrown.\r\n\r\nFleming Carter felt they should all be dead. But they remained very\r\nmuch alive. They should have been at least mangled and maimed. None\r\nappeared even scratched.\r\n\r\nAll this, Carter told himself firmly, was a chaos of the mind and\r\nnothing more. It was mental panic of such violence that it was\r\nmanifesting in the physical. He told himself this while he sought to\r\nmaintain equilibrium while standing upon nothing and wondering where\r\nsuch a terrific wind could come from in a sheltered elevator shaft.\r\n\r\nThen it was over. The hurricane subsided; the floor stiffened beneath\r\nthem and they were lying in a heap--a heap made interesting by Peggy\r\nWilson\'s legs sprawled above the others in a very unladylike manner.\r\n\r\nWilmer Payton groaned.\r\n\r\n"Shut up," Fleming Carter said sharply. "Don\'t start a wave of panic\r\nand hysteria. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
You aren\'t hurt!"\r\n\r\n"How the hell do you know I ain\'t?" Wilmer Payton demanded with\r\nchildlike docility.\r\n\r\n"Because I\'m not and no one else seems to be and we all fell the same\r\ndistance."\r\n\r\nFleming Carter began to extricate himself from the pack. This\r\nnecessitated pressing rather personally against Peggy Wilson. He did\r\nwhat he had to do and then drew the girl\'s skirt down as gently and\r\nhastily as possible. He was relieved to find she was in no shape to\r\ncare what anyone did with her skirt.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the elevator operator, upon finding he could not move the\r\nelevator, returned to reassure the occupants. He went to the seventh\r\nfloor and called down very cheerily, "Everything\'s all right, folks. If\r\nthis\'d happened before six o\'clock there\'d be plenty of blessed people\r\naround, but it\'s almost seven and the engineer ain\'t back from supper\r\nyet. It won\'t be but a little while though, and then--"\r\n\r\nThe operator became aware that only silence answered him. Had they been\r\nscared dumb? "You--hey you--down there--"\r\n\r\nMore silence. The operator frowned and crawled down into the shaft. He\r\nlooked through the trap. Empty. "Well I\'ll be damned!" he said. And\r\nbecause an obvious situation was covered by an obvious answer, added,\r\n"All four of them crawled out and went home. Funny they couldn\'t stick\r\naround a few minutes."\r\n\r\nHe did not ponder the difficulties involved in such an escape. The only\r\ndirection they could have gone was up and out on the seventh floor. He\r\nthus accepted the obvious. And his only thought on the subject was that\r\nhe\'d like to have been the one to boost the girl up.\r\n\r\nLater, he bawled the engineer out and that was that so far as he was\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nBut the situation was far less simple for the four passengers. As\r\nFleming Carter struggled to his feet, Walter Maltby used his leg for a\r\nladder and came erect also and said, "I\'ll bet Jenny will sue somebody\r\nfor this! Jenny won\'t let them get away with it! 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Not for a minute."\r\n\r\nWilmer Payton was also on his feet looking dully about him. Fleming\r\nCarter said, "Why don\'t you help the lady, young man? 

=== Chunk 6 ===
I\'m sure she\r\nwould appreciate the courtesy from you more than myself or--?"\r\n\r\nHe looked questioningly at the other male member of the quartette.\r\n\r\n"Walter Maltby--and as I was saying, Jenny will never--"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure she won\'t."\r\n\r\n"What happened?" Wilmer Payton asked of no one in particular as he\r\nhauled Peggy Wilson to her feet.\r\n\r\nThe girl was biting her lip, trying hard to be brave. "The elevator\r\nmust have fallen. It\'s a wonder we weren\'t all killed!"\r\n\r\nThey agreed. All save Fleming Carter who was looking around with bright\r\ninterest. "It seems to me that we are no longer in the elevator."\r\n\r\nWalter Maltby\'s jaw dropped. "No longer in the--"\r\n\r\n"This is a somewhat larger area. And I fail to see any walls. Also, the\r\nceiling seems to have vanished."\r\n\r\nThe other three gazed about in shocked silence and the truth of Fleming\r\nCarter\'s statements dawned on them. No walls, no ceiling. Nothing but\r\nhard earth under their feet and a high blue sky above.\r\n\r\n"Why we\'re out--out in the country!" Peggy Wilson babbled.\r\n\r\n"I agree," Fleming Carter said. "But let\'s not get panicky. We are\r\nstill alive and unhurt."\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t understand it," Walter Maltby said, plaintively. "I just\r\ndon\'t understand it."\r\n\r\nFleming Carter regarded the little man with pity. No Jenny around to\r\nreassure the little man with her domineering bulk. Carter knew as a\r\nmatter of course that Jenny would be both bulky and domineering.\r\n\r\nCarter looked about him. They were out in open country--that was\r\nobvious. There was a huge sun and a huge blue sky and huge clouds\r\nfloating overhead. Everything in place but something very wrong.\r\n\r\nThings were just too big.\r\n\r\nThat was it, Carter told himself. The size of this new world was far\r\nout of proportion to the size of him and his new friends. They were\r\nall standing in coarse grass that reached their knees--high grass--but\r\nCarter realized instantly that the grass was not high. They themselves\r\nwere short!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWilmer Payton, holding Peggy Wilson in the crook of one arm, looked\r\nabout through eyes that obviously sent no intelligent messages to his\r\nbrain. He turned them on Carter and said, "I don\'t get any of this."\r\n\r\n"I think I know what happened," Carter said.\r\n\r\nThis even caught the interest of Walter Maltby who was wondering what\r\nJenny would have to say about his not arriving home on schedule. "What\r\n_did_ happen?"\r\n\r\n"We\'ve fallen--or were snatched--through some sort of a space-time\r\nwarp."\r\n\r\nWilmer Payton gaped idiotically and said, "We did _which_ through a\r\n_what_?"\r\n\r\nFleming Carter seemed not to hear. He was staring pensively at the\r\nthick blades of grass that brushed his knees. "There are more things in\r\nheaven and earth, Horatio--" he mused.\r\n\r\n"There ain\'t nobody here named Horatio," Wilmer said sullenly.\r\n\r\n"Excuse me. My mind was wandering," Carter\'s mind was not wandering at\r\nall, however. He said, "There are certain unexplained phenomena that\r\nare believed to have happened in our world. People have been known to\r\ndisappear mysteriously and those who remain behind formulate theories\r\nas to the how and the why of their vanishing. It is believed by some\r\nthat people can be moved, under certain conditions from one plane of\r\nexistence to another--that there are many of these so-called planes of\r\nexistence where many and varied peoples live and breathe upon them.\r\n\r\n"Of course, no proof has ever been found for these theories because\r\nthe vanished persons never came back to testify, but--" Carter stopped\r\nsuddenly and regarded the three with a touch of compassion. "You\r\nhaven\'t the least idea what I\'m talking about, do you?

=== Chunk 7 ===
"\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid not," Walter Maltby said timidly.\r\n\r\n"Well, never mind. Perhaps I don\'t either. In any case, existence is\r\nits own excuse for accepting any locale. Suffice it to say we are now\r\nin a world that was not built for us--a world for creatures of far\r\ngreater dimensions than ourselves--and how we got here is really of\r\nlittle importance."\r\n\r\nPeggy Wilson was now snugly in Wilmer Payton\'s arms, her head tight\r\nagainst his chest. Wilmer was just opening his mouth to say something\r\nwhen, over the slope of the land, a huge form appeared. There was\r\nnothing mystifying about it. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
The creature was obviously a man. He\r\nwore rather strange loose clothing that, Carter thought, had some\r\nresemblance to those of the ancient Greeks. But otherwise there was\r\nnothing different about him except his size. As he approached, Fleming\r\nCarter estimated that Wilmer Payton--the tallest of the four--would\r\nabout come to the top of his odd sandal-like footgear.\r\n\r\nThere was no panic now--the three being completely frozen with terror\r\nand Carter statue-quiet and sharply alert. The giant, he was sure,\r\nwould pass within two hundred yards of them. A distance dangerously\r\nclose considering the man\'s size.\r\n\r\nStill, Carter was optimistic. There was no reason why the giant should\r\nsee them. As things were, they could certainly hope to be overlooked.\r\n\r\nBut Peggy Wilson dashed this hope as the pressure within her became too\r\nstrong to contain and broke out in the form of a scream.\r\n\r\nThe giant stopped, took a few quick steps in their direction and was\r\nupon them. Carter knew then, that they were lost. A huge hand swooped\r\ndown and lifted Walter Maltby into the air. Far above, Carter saw the\r\nterrified Maltby being transferred carefully to the giant\'s other\r\nhand. Now Wilmer Payton and Peggy Wilson were running blindly in two\r\ndirections, Peggy having been suddenly deserted by her protector. Twice\r\nmore the huge hand descended and the two also vanished into the vast\r\npalm.\r\n\r\nApparently, the giant overlooked Fleming Carter who had stood quite\r\nstill during the whole time. But Carter made a swift decision based\r\nmore on charity than good sense. Somehow, he could not leave those\r\nthree to their fate. So he cried out and waved his arms. "Just a\r\nmoment! You overlooked me!"\r\n\r\nThe hand swooped down again as the giant saw him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCarter Fleming found himself resting comfortably with his face against\r\nsomeone\'s back. Otherwise he was completely surrounded by soft flesh.\r\nHe realized they were being handled carefully however so he felt that\r\ndeath, while definitely a threat had been at least postponed. He\r\nwondered about the others, so close to him and yet so far away so far\r\nas contact was concerned. He knew the terror that raced through their\r\nminds and he pitied them....\r\n\r\nThe giant was continuing on, Carter decided, and he endured the ride as\r\nbest he could.\r\n\r\nThen it terminated suddenly as Carter and the others were very gently\r\ntumbled into a room. The room had no ceiling but this situation was\r\nspeedily remedied when a ceiling was lowered and set into place above\r\nthem. In the resulting darkness, Carter heard Peggy Wilson sobbing and\r\nvarious unintelligible noises from Maltby and Payton. Then the room\r\nbegan suddenly to move in haphazard directions.\r\n\r\nPossibly this was finally the end, but Fleming Carter could not bring\r\nhimself to think so. Because even though the room pitched and tossed,\r\nCarter felt it was being done rather gently by the giant hands.\r\n\r\nThen it was over. The room settled down and remained on solid base.\r\nImmediately there was a rending sound and a vast finger was thrust\r\nthrough the wall just below ceiling level. The finger was withdrawn but\r\nonly to reappear when thrust through the other side.\r\n\r\nIt vanished again and the two resulting holes let in ample air and\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nFor a few moments Carter and the other three sat motionless, waiting.\r\nSomething was going on outside the room--the room itself moving\r\nslightly--but the violent tossing was evidently over.\r\n\r\nPeggy Wilson spoke first--or rather, sobbed. "Where are we?

=== Chunk 9 ===
"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure I don\'t know, my dear, but if I stood on the young man\'s\r\nshoulders I could look out through one of those openings and perhaps\r\nlearn a little something."\r\n\r\n"You want me to lift you?" Wilmer Payton said dully.\r\n\r\n"That is the general idea," Carter replied in a gentle voice.\r\n\r\nWilmer braced himself against the wall and Carter clambered to his\r\nshoulders and cautiously pushed his head through the opening. He\r\nremained thus for quite a while--until Wilmer Payton began moving\r\nrestlessly. Then he clambered down.\r\n\r\nThey waited for him to speak but he said nothing. He stared at the hole\r\nwith a look of amazement upon his face as though, for the first time\r\nthe wonder of this strange transition had struck him forcibly. Then\r\nhe turned his eyes upon his three companions and there was a look in\r\nhis eyes that had not been there before; personal, yet impersonally\r\nanalytical. A hard look to read, so they could have no way of knowing\r\nthat he was trying to forecast how they would react to the fate that\r\nawaited them.\r\n\r\n"Well," Wilmer Payton demanded impatiently. "Did you see anything?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. This is not a room. It is a huge box of some sort. It is bound\r\naround on all sides by what looks like red carpeting of a width used\r\nin hallways. I believe such carpetings are called runners. Attached to\r\nthe top is a large white sail although it appears to be made of paper\r\nrather than canvas." He was watching them closely as he spoke.\r\n\r\n"It took you all that time to see those things?" Walter Maltby asked a\r\ntrifle plaintively.\r\n\r\n"No. There were other things."\r\n\r\nAt this point Peggy Wilson, coming out of her shock, began to\r\ncry hysterically. "My God! 

=== Chunk 10 ===
What\'s to become of us? We\'ll all be\r\nkilled--murdered!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think so," Carter said.\r\n\r\n"Then we\'ll be held prisoner. That will be just as bad!"\r\n\r\n"In a sense, you will be held prisoner--but I don\'t think it will be\r\nbad. I think our jailer will probably be a rather kindly person who\r\nwill give us every consideration."\r\n\r\n"How could a jailer do that?" Peggy Wilson moaned.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCarter laid a hand upon her shoulder. "Consider, my dear. All your life\r\nyou have needed a mother. Now you will have the equivalent of one." He\r\nturned to Walter Maltby. "And you. You have learned to function only as\r\na result of a dominating wife\'s promptings. Our jailer will fill that\r\nrole for you."\r\n\r\nLastly he regarded Wilmer Payton. "You, young man will be directed and\r\nguided. You will not have need of the brain power with which you are\r\nnot equipped.\r\n\r\n"All of you will be content. None will have any decisions to make--all\r\nwill be taken care of. Can you think of a more pleasant destiny?"\r\n\r\nWalter Maltby said, "You\'re talking in circles. Talking but not saying\r\nanything!"\r\n\r\nCarter had turned away, smiling. "This is very strange. We were\r\ntransported to another plane, but not snatched up willy-nilly. There\r\nwas a pattern behind it. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
Three people admirably suited to their new\r\nfate."\r\n\r\nWilmer Payton seized Fleming Carter by the arm and whirled him around.\r\n"Will you please tell us what you\'re talking about?"\r\n\r\n"Of course," Carter said quietly. "To speak the absolute truth, we are\r\nin a box. The box is tied with a wide red ribbon. The thing I called\r\na sail is in reality a greeting card upon which certain words are\r\nwritten; words not too difficult to decipher."\r\n\r\n"Well, go on--what are the words."\r\n\r\n"In English, they would read--\'Happy Birthday, Darling.\' You are\r\nsomeone\'s birthday present."\r\n\r\nPeggy\'s face was ashen. 

=== Chunk 12 ===
"You speak of _us_," she whispered. "How well\r\nsuited _we_ are for this fate. What about yourself?

=== Chunk 13 ===
"\r\n\r\nCarter smiled. "I expect this to be the most interesting period of my\r\nlife," he said. "You see, the present is for me. I picked it out."\r\n\r\nAnd as they watched in stunned amazement, Carter began to grow.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
