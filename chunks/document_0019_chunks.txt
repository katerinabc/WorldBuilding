Lang\r\n\r\n            Earth had a problem ... and the Martian visitor\r\n               had a very deadly means of solving it....\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n                     Planet Stories January 1951.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n"I\'m only here to help you," said the man from Mars.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve proved that," the Secretary admitted. "In the six weeks that\r\nyou\'ve been here, you\'ve wiped out rabies, measles, and the common\r\ncold: but sir, this latest proposal of yours is blasphemous!"\r\n\r\nThe man from Mars waved an appendage in the direction of the\r\nSecretary\'s desk, atop which a newspaper was lying open. "After\r\nreading what that paper has to say can you still doubt that what I\r\npropose is necessary?"\r\n\r\nThe young man in uniform crossed the room and picked up the newspaper.\r\nHe read the headlines aloud, bitterly: "INDIAN FAMINE ARMY STORMS NEW\r\nDELHI"; "TASMAN REPUBLIC BIDS FOR PLACE IN SUN"; "PLAGUE DECIMATES\r\nLOWER NILE."\r\n\r\n"You could end that plague." The Assistant\'s voice was accusing.\r\n\r\n"I could, of course. The battles and the starvation would still be\r\nwith you, though. Why do you persist in treating the symptoms instead\r\nof the sickness? I am an objective observer, far enough away from your\r\nproblems to see them clearly, something which no human can ever hope\r\nto do. You Earthlings suffer war and famine and plague for one reason\r\nonly: that there are four and eight-tenths billion of you living on an\r\nEarth which can feed only about two and a half billion of you well.\r\nGentlemen, the population of your planet must be reduced by one-half if\r\nyour race is to survive."\r\n\r\n"Couldn\'t we send our surplus population to Mars, or to Venus?" the\r\nAssistant asked.\r\n\r\nThe man from Mars winced. "The sands of Mars can\'t support cactuses,\r\nmuch less fields of wheat and rice and corn. Venus is a solid sea of\r\nformaldehyde solution." He glanced around to each of the three men in\r\nthe room.

"To you, my scheme may seem heartless. But would it be more\r\ncruel to kill millions now than to allow billions to die in continual\r\nwar in the next thousand years? Do you remember your last such war?\r\nThe Ukrainian wheatlands scorched to desert by the thermonuclears? New\r\nEngland swept by epidemics of anthrax and tularemia? All China tortured\r\nby starvation and the hundred nagging sicknesses that follow hunger?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I remember."

The Secretary rolled his pen between his fingers,\r\nstaring at it. "How do you intend to--liquidate--the excess two\r\nbillions?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t explain it to you; you lack the basic knowledge.

It will be\r\nquick and painless though, I promise. Then Earth will see peace and\r\nhope; a new start!"\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t take all the responsibility for this decision upon myself,"\r\nthe Secretary said. He glanced hopefully toward the Assistant and the\r\nyoung man in uniform. Their eyes flinched away.\r\n\r\n"You might take a vote," suggested the man from Mars. He picked up the\r\nSecretary\'s scratch pad and ripped off three sheets of paper. "Just\r\nmark _Yes_ or _No_. I will respect your decision: after all, I\'m only\r\nhere to help you."\r\n\r\nThe Secretary stared at the slip of paper lying on his desk. He glanced\r\ntoward the other two humans for encouragement; but the Assistant was\r\nstaring at the wall across the room, and the young man in uniform was\r\nsilently contemplating the carpet at his feet.\r\n\r\nConvulsively the Secretary scooched the paper toward him and scribbled\r\nhis vote. Folding the paper, he looked demandingly toward his two\r\ncompanions. The young man in uniform looked up, then turned to hold his\r\npaper against the wall as he wrote his decision. The Assistant remained\r\nseated, holding the paper on top of a book while he lettered out his\r\nvote.\r\n\r\nThe man from Mars collected the three ballots, unfolded them, and read\r\nthe three votes. "It\'s two to one," he announced. He crushed the papers\r\ninto small, white pellets and tossed them out the open window. "What I\r\nhave to do will be finished by noon tomorrow."\r\n\r\nThe man from Mars left the room, closing the door very softly behind\r\nhim. The other three sat silent a moment and then got up and left\r\nwithout looking one another in the face.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next day the Secretary and the Assistant sat in the office, staring\r\nat the clock above the door. At twelve-oh-seven the door slammed open\r\nfor the young man in uniform.\r\n\r\n"Is it done?" the Assistant asked.\r\n\r\n"Done? Of course, it\'s done!" The young man in uniform leaned against\r\nthe door and shook with spasmic laughter. "Now there\'s food enough\r\nand room enough for everyone. The man from Mars promised to solve our\r\npopulation problem. He did. At twelve noon, Eastern Daylight Saving\r\nTime, every woman and girl on Earth dropped dead."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
