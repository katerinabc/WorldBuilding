Done. My wonderful red Thunderflash, I thought\r\nto myself, isn\'t worth the electricity to atomize it to Kingdom Come.\r\n\r\nEver since that drunk in his two-seat Charioteer plowed into the rear\r\nend with such force that even my radar repellant couldn\'t stop it,\r\nmy Thunderflash had been out of kilter. The specialists my garage\r\nrecommended worked over it for two days, but couldn\'t get it to\r\nrunning the way it did new.\r\n\r\nAnd what was I supposed to do for an automobile now? I had signed the\r\ncustomary 40-year pact for half my salary to pay for it. That meant I\r\nwould still be shelling out by 2117.\r\n\r\nWeeping over it wasn\'t going to do any good. It was stuck on the fifth\r\nlevel expressway and that was that. I levered myself out (at least\r\nthe ejector still worked) then got behind the car and gave it a good\r\nold-fashioned push to get it on an off-ramp, out of the stream of\r\ntraffic.\r\n\r\nAfter I parked I remembered I was heading for a date with Jenny. I\r\nchecked my wallet. No, not enough for a taxi there. I would just have\r\nto phone her to cancel the date.\r\n\r\nReluctantly I pushed the tip of my tongue against my tooth telephone.\r\n\r\n"Operator," said the operator.\r\n\r\n"Poplar 3104, please."\r\n\r\n"Thank you.

One moment.

I\'ll ache it for you."\r\n\r\nShe dialed the number of the tooth telephone in Jenny\'s mouth, so the\r\ntwo fine wires sent gentle electric currents into the nerve. On the\r\nthird ache Jenny clicked the receiver open with the tip of her tongue.\r\n\r\n"Hello?"\r\n\r\n"Jenny, this is Arnold. I won\'t be able to come over this evening."\r\n\r\n"But we had a date," Jenny said in a petulant voice.\r\n\r\n"I know, but my car broke down."\r\n\r\n"Again?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, honey."\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you do something about it?" Jenny complained.\r\n\r\n"But baby, what can I do? I\'ve been to the garage. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
I\'ve been to the\r\nspecialists. I\'m so broke on account of these repair bills I\'ve been\r\nliving on macaroni concentrate for the last couple of weeks."\r\n\r\nJenny, my beautiful sweetheart, was distinctly unhappy. "Don\'t come to\r\nme with your troubles," she replied. "In fact, you don\'t have to come\r\nto me at all until you can come like a gentleman."\r\n\r\n"Aw, listen just a minute, Jenny," I started to plead. But it was too\r\nlate. Jenny had clicked off.\r\n\r\nA fine thermokettle of fish! A month ago I had a shiny lifetime car and\r\nwas romancing the best looking girl in town. Then one drunk comes along\r\nand my car is next to useless and my girl is mad at me.\r\n\r\nFeeling in a distinctly blue mood I moved my tongue to the other side\r\nof my mouth and shoved on my tooth radio. I rolled the tongue over the\r\nbottom of the tooth until I got a program with some blues music. Just\r\nthe way I felt. The blues. I sat in the front seat of my Thunderflash\r\nand listened to the music echoing against my tonsils.\r\n\r\nAfter the song came the inevitable commercial. Only this was a new one.\r\nThe announcer said:\r\n\r\n"Here\'s some big, big, big news from Grinning Gregory, your largest\r\nvolume dealer in lifetime cars. Gregory announced today that his used\r\npeople lots are nearly empty. Yes, Grinning Gregory\'s used people lots\r\nare nearly empty. And that means good, good, good news for you car\r\nowners with lifetime contracts who would like new cars.\r\n\r\n"Grinning Gregory has added to his stocks of new Orions,\r\nThunderflashes, Galaxies, Solars, Charioteers, Protons and Fords. For\r\nthe first time in two years, yes, the first time in two years, he has\r\nmore new cars than new people to sell them to.\r\n\r\n"So he is offering a limited number of them to used people, you folks\r\nwho have had cars, on his conveniently located used people lots. Come\r\non down and let some of Grinning Gregory\'s new cars look you over.\r\nBe sure and bring photostats of your credit ratings and official car\r\nhistories. Hurry, hurry, hurry and avoid the rush to Grinning Gregory\'s\r\nused people lots."\r\n\r\nThe commercial ended and was replaced by music.\r\n\r\nGosh, that was exciting news. Ever since the accident I had given up\r\nhope of ever owning a decent running car again, automobile prices and\r\ngovernment restrictions being what they were.\r\n\r\nI clicked on my tooth telephone and ached my garage mechanic to come\r\nby and pick up my car. Then I took my credit rating and official car\r\nhistory from the glove compartment and caught a helibus to the nearest\r\nof Grinning Gregory\'s used people lots.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA lot of guys were already there before me, most of them in the same\r\nfix I was. They had been in accidents or they were divorced and their\r\nwives got custody of the car, although they still had to pay for it.\r\n\r\nSome of them had been on the lot for some time and looked a little\r\nshopworn under the lights and fluttering pennants, but they hadn\'t\r\nfound a car yet that would take them. We were all classified as used\r\npeople, a lot less desirable than people who hadn\'t signed for cars yet.\r\n\r\nOne of Grinning Gregory\'s contract brokers lined us up in a row facing\r\nthe path the cars would come by robot direction. The fellow to my right\r\nslicked his hair down neatly and began shining his shoe-tops on the\r\nbacks of his trouser legs.\r\n\r\n"Sure hope I get selected," he whispered nervously to me. "Boy, don\'t\r\nyou sometimes wish you were living a couple of hundred years ago when\r\ncars were cheap enough so that people were doing the picking?"\r\n\r\n"Not me," I told him. "Drive that junk? I\'ll admit you didn\'t have to\r\nswear but a couple of years of your life away. But look at all you get\r\nnow in a car."\r\n\r\n"Mmm, I suppose you\'re right," he said. "My Orion was stolen a year ago\r\nwhen I accidentally cut off the burglar photocell. The police never did\r\nfind it and I\'ve been trying ever since to get another one.

=== Chunk 7 ===
"\r\n\r\n"This is the first time I\'ve tried," I said. "My car...."\r\n\r\n"Ssh," he interrupted. "Here they come."\r\n\r\nA procession of new cars, led by a beautiful green Solar convertible,\r\ninched its way along the row of hopeful buyers, all of us with our\r\ncredit ratings and car histories pinned to our lapels.\r\n\r\nEach car\'s robot mechanism recorded our statistics, took our pictures,\r\nnoted our heights, weights and appearances, then began to correlate the\r\ndata.\r\n\r\nBy government order the robot mechanism was directed to select its\r\nmost promising future owner. A sobersides bank president, for example,\r\nmight dearly love to change his big black Galaxy sedan for a low-slung\r\nCharioteer sports car, but sports cars were planned with crew-cutted\r\ncollege boys in mind, so the bank president would be likely to end up\r\nwith another big Galaxy. Of course, the payment rate was fixed and the\r\ncontracts were almost always for 40 years. A tie salesman might want a\r\nGalaxy to make an impression on his neighbors, but he\'d probably wind\r\nup with a Proton or a Thunderflash like I had. I was a tie salesman.\r\n\r\nThe Solar came abreast of me. I stood straight and smiling as it began\r\nto note my statistics. It flashed a 23 when it was done.\r\n\r\nNot so good. That put me in the 23 percentile rank of its desirability.\r\nThe next car, a rhinestone Ford, gave me a 28. I was rated 22, 31, 14\r\n(by a Galaxy), 27, 35 and 30 by the next six cars. That was the way it\r\nwent for the whole procession. I received the highest rating, 58, from\r\nan experimental model Proton that was no longer in production, but I\r\nknew it was rating everybody higher and I was pretty gloomy.\r\n\r\nImagine my surprise when my name was called out as one of the possible\r\nchoices. I went into the broker\'s office and was told the Proton would\r\nselect me if I would get rid of all but ten years of my Thunderflash\r\ncontract. That meant I had to find someone to take my car and 27 years\r\nof my contract, since I had been paying for three years of the 40. The\r\nprice of the Proton, the broker told me, was scaled down to a 30-year\r\ncontract because it was an off-model.\r\n\r\nBut who would take my heap with a 27-year contract attached to it? The\r\nbroker said Grinning Gregory might go for five years, just out of the\r\ngoodness of his big, big, big heart. I wouldn\'t get that kind of a deal\r\nanywhere else, the broker said.\r\n\r\nMaybe I wouldn\'t, but that didn\'t do me much good. I needed someone to\r\ntake 27 years.\r\n\r\nHarry! Why didn\'t I think of Harry before? He didn\'t have a car yet.\r\nSkinflint Harry didn\'t want to sign the standard 40-year contract for a\r\ncar and he had been shopping around for second-hand cars. Besides, good\r\nold Harry knew how crazy I was about Jenny. He had even taken her out a\r\ncouple of times.\r\n\r\nI gave Harry an ache on the telephone and told him I\'d be right over.\r\nThen I ached the garage and the mechanic told me he could get my\r\nThunderflash in pretty good running condition again, even though he\r\ncouldn\'t promise anything permanent. I caught a helibus to my friend\'s\r\napartment.\r\n\r\n"Harry, old pal, I\'ve got the chance of a lifetime for both of us."\r\n\r\nHarry eyed me suspiciously. "How\'s that?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Well, here\'s the deal. You know my real fine Thunderflash? You said\r\nit was a sharp car. It is. It\'s a first class car. But ever since that\r\nslight accident, I\'ve had just a wee bit of trouble with it. Not much,\r\nyou understand, but it\'s niggling enough to annoy my girl, Jenny. You\r\nremember Jenny, the girl you used to go with before I cut you out? Ha!\r\nHa! Anyhow, Jenny wants me to get another car. A newer one."\r\n\r\n"But how can you?" Harry asked. "You already have one."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just it, old buddy," I replied. "Grinning Gregory has one of\r\nthose experimental model Protons. It\'s a beauty, shimmering orange with\r\npurple wheels and bearskin upholstery. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
You\'d love it. They\'ll let me\r\nhave it on a 30-year contract if I can sell 27 years of my Thunderflash\r\ncontract. So here\'s what I\'m going to do for you, pal. I\'ll keep ten\r\nyears of the contract and let you have the Thunderflash for the rest.\r\nYou\'ll be getting a three-year-old car with 13 years of the contract\r\ntaken care of. Now is that a deal or is that a deal!"\r\n\r\nHarry wasn\'t convinced. "What\'s wrong with your car?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, hardly anything."\r\n\r\n"What\'s hardly anything?"\r\n\r\n"Not even worth mentioning."\r\n\r\n"What\'s not worth mentioning?"\r\n\r\n"To tell the truth, the frame is just the least trifle out of line and\r\nevery once in a great while it makes the rear wheel twist sideways."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said Harry.\r\n\r\n"Good old cautious, hard-headed Harry," I told him. "You are getting\r\nthe deal of a lifetime and doing a good, loyal friend a big favor\r\nbesides."\r\n\r\n"I still don\'t know, Arnold," said Harry.\r\n\r\n"All right. When will you know?"\r\n\r\n"Let me sleep on it tonight."\r\n\r\n"OK, Harry."\r\n\r\nI went home in high spirits. I knew Harry would come through for me and\r\ntake that wreck off my hands. He always was a man with an eye out for a\r\ndeal.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI slept late the next morning, but by afternoon I was over to the used\r\npeople lot to tell them to hold the Proton for me for another day.\r\nInstead, they tapped me over the head with the news that someone came\r\nin that morning and bought it. And they didn\'t have another one like it\r\nthat would accept me.\r\n\r\nAnother hope gone astray! I caught a helibus to the garage and picked\r\nup my Thunderflash after paying a whopping repair bill. I drove to\r\nJenny\'s house to convince her it was just as good as new.\r\n\r\nJenny\'s mother met me at the door.\r\n\r\n"Hello, Arnold," she said with the big smile of greeting she always\r\ngave me. "I\'m glad to see you and I hope you\'ll keep dropping over to\r\nsee me, but Jenny isn\'t here any more."\r\n\r\n"Not here?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid not."\r\n\r\n"Where is she?"\r\n\r\n"She eloped less than an hour ago. You remember the boy she used to\r\ngo with, Harry? He came by in a beautiful new car. It was shimmering\r\norange with purple wheels and bearskin upholstery and...."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
