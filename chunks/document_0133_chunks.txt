Now Manson was ready to_ kill!\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n                    Planet Stories September 1951.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe left his gyro on the dark lawn and circled the villa, carefully\r\navoiding the wash of light from open windows. The blast gun lay snug\r\nand cold in his hand, and his thought ran bleakly: _Here am I, Peter\r\nManson, pacifist, idealist, reformer, preacher in print of tolerance\r\nand amity--about to kidnap a man whom I shall almost certainly kill\r\nbefore morning._\r\n\r\nTomorrow the telecast would list his madness with other insanities:\r\nsex murders, suicides, political drumbeatings for the coming holocaust\r\nof the inevitable Fourth War....\r\n\r\n_War._\r\n\r\n"They\'re going too far," he said, half aloud. "Their routine meddlings\r\nwere bad enough, but another war now might mean the end of everything."\r\n\r\nHe found the alien who called himself Leonard Havlik in a bright,\r\nbook-lined study, packing a miscellany of papers into a brief case\r\nthat bore his name in gold lettering. A secretary was helping, a slim\r\ngirl with crisp, copper-colored hair and clear green eyes.\r\n\r\nManson waited, tense with unaccustomed strain. Somewhere a bird trilled\r\nsleepily, and the night-wind, fragrant with the smell of trampled\r\nclover, blew cool against his damp face.\r\n\r\nIrrelevantly, the scene inside reminded him of his own quiet study\r\nwhere he had labored for ten years over the scant gleanings of\r\nhis search. In that time he had written four books, fighting with\r\na reformer\'s apostolic zeal to open the eyes of men to their own\r\npossibilities, and he had failed.\r\n\r\nHe had not awakened his kind, but he had found the Watchers. The\r\nfailure was not his fault.

It was Theirs....\r\n\r\nThe girl left the room. Manson straightened at his window, bringing up\r\nthe blast gun.\r\n\r\n"Come out, Havlik," he ordered. "Quickly, or I\'ll blow you to dust\r\nwhere you stand--_Watcher_!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHis quarry looked up, startled--a small, dark man with a thin, tired\r\nface and sparse gray hair, a perfect replica of the million ordinary\r\nbusinessmen his camouflage of humanity aped.\r\n\r\nManson snicked off the safety catch of his weapon, and Havlik came\r\nthrough the window quickly, without protest. Manson prodded him into\r\nthe gyro and manacled his wrists together.\r\n\r\n"We Earthmen have a time-tested proverb," Manson said, "to the effect\r\nthat you can\'t fool all the people all the time. I\'ve spent ten years\r\nsearching for you, Havlik--and here I am."\r\n\r\nHe set the autopilot for his cabin on Green River, holding his blast\r\ngun warily, and sent the gyro slanting upward into the night. Havlik\r\nsmiled faintly, dark eyes gleaming in the light of the instrument panel.\r\n\r\n"Laugh while you can," Manson said grimly. "I\'ve learned something of\r\nyou Watchers already.

I\'ll know more by morning."\r\n\r\n"Force was unnecessary," Havlik said unexpectedly. "I would have given\r\nyou information willingly, since our mission here is ended. The Kha\r\nNiish, who are our masters, have ordered us to leave Earth. Tonight."\r\n\r\nManson stared, the alien\'s assurance fanning his anger.\r\n\r\n"You\'re lying--you Watchers have mingled with us for centuries, using\r\nour own ignorance to set us against each other. You\'ve kept us in\r\nperpetual confusion, deafening us with our own bickering while you\r\ntightened your hold on us. Now you\'re fomenting a Fourth War that may\r\nwipe us out completely, to save yourselves the trouble of liquidating\r\nus directly. You\'d never go now, with success almost in your hands."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you mistake our intention," Havlik said. "How do you know\r\nyou\'re right?"\r\n\r\n"Because men of themselves would not do the brutal, idiotic things\r\nthat fill the telecasts every day," Manson said. "We are a gregarious\r\npeople, craving affection--why should we lie and steal and murder\r\neach other by the millions? Man is a rational animal, yet he does not\r\nbehave in a rational manner. By simple induction, the basic cause of\r\nhis social idiocy stems from outside himself. Someone, or Something, is\r\nsetting us against each other. I suspected as much ten years ago, and\r\ntonight I have proved it."\r\n\r\nHavlik shrugged. "You\'ve wasted your time. We leave Earth tonight."\r\n\r\nManson laughed shortly. "_You\'re_ not going anywhere, my friend. I need\r\nyou for information.

"\r\n\r\n"What else would you know? Our reason for quitting Earth?"\r\n\r\n"You\'re not leaving at all," Manson said, nettled. "You may have\r\nplanned a routine jump to your base on Pluto, but you\'re not giving up\r\na juicy plum like Earth. Not after all these years!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe peered through the gyro\'s side glass searching for the white peak of\r\nGreen Mountain to check his position. The skyglow of Denver shimmered\r\nin the east, but the peak was lost in darkness.\r\n\r\n"You misunderstand our motive," the alien said. "But you\'re quite right\r\nabout our base on Pluto. Induction again?"\r\n\r\n"On a different level, yes," Manson said. "Pluto is a solar anomaly--a\r\nsmall, heavy planet where there should be nothing but a larger and\r\nlighter world. Pluto was never born to Sol--it\'s an alien planet,\r\nbrought in from Outside by you Watchers."\r\n\r\nA red light winked on the control panel, and the gyro swerved\r\nfractionally. A fiery streak of crimson rocket exhaust flared ahead and\r\nvanished, explaining the deviation.\r\n\r\n"Seattle-Miami express," Manson muttered. Then the unnatural angle of\r\nthe exhaust-trail registered, troubling him. "But it shouldn\'t cross my\r\ncourse--and it should be going up, not _down_!"\r\n\r\n"Your crusade is based on a false premise," Havlik said. "We came to\r\nEarth less than fifty years ago, not to destroy humanity but to guide\r\nit. The Kha Niish sent us as missionaries, to sow the seed of Their\r\nbenign culture among men as we have sowed it among a thousand other\r\ninfant races born into Their galaxy."\r\n\r\nThe gyro tilted, spiraling down for a landing. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
A farmhouse, lighted\r\nwindows cheerful against the dark countryside, rose to meet it. Beside\r\nthe house, standing on end like a giant cartridge case, Manson saw a\r\nsleek, shining bulk--a ship.\r\n\r\nHe raised incredulous eyes to meet the alien\'s dark stare.\r\nComprehension stunned him.\r\n\r\n"You fiend," he breathed. "You\'ve tricked me somehow--you\'ve played\r\ncat-and-mouse with me from the first!"\r\n\r\nHe remembered the gun in his hand and swung it up.\r\n\r\n"Let your weapon drop," Havlik said. "You set the autopilot at my\r\ndirection. This is our evacuation point."\r\n\r\nThe gun slid from Manson\'s fingers. He tried to retrieve it from the\r\nfloor and cried out, startled, when his body refused to obey.\r\n\r\nThe alien removed his manacles. "You will be free again as soon as we\r\nlift."\r\n\r\n"Lies," Manson grated. He fought to break the stasis that held him,\r\nveins knotting in his forehead with the effort.

"I might have known!"\r\n\r\nThe gyro landed gently, a hundred yards from the cylinder.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFigures swarmed about the great ship, pouring up a wide ramp in orderly\r\nembarkation. The girl Manson had seen at the villa came running toward\r\nthe gyro, copper hair blowing in the night-wind.\r\n\r\n"You were almost late," she called to Havlik. "We\'re ready to--" She\r\ncaught sight of the Earthman and broke off.\r\n\r\nIn the dark depth of her eyes Manson saw understanding and a great\r\npity, and for the first time it came to him that Havlik had not lied.\r\nAliens they might be, but not destroyers--in this girl burned the same\r\nideals, the same transcendent zeal that drove him. She was as human,\r\nbasically, as he.\r\n\r\n_The same will to raise up the helpless is in us both_, he thought.\r\n_The compulsion to carry the saving light of reason to those in\r\ndarkness...._\r\n\r\n"Wait," he begged. "Your master wouldn\'t have ordered you away if Earth\r\nneeded you--and if men can work out their own salvation, then they\r\ndon\'t need me, either! Take me with you out there--let me help you, let\r\nme see the Outside galaxy of the Kha Niish for myself!"\r\n\r\nHe spoke to Havlik, but his eyes clung to the girl as to a magnet. She\r\nmet his gaze fully, the compassion in her own eyes deeper than grief.\r\n\r\nHavlik shook his head. "Your sanity would not bear the presence of the\r\nKha Niish, nor of the other races Outside. You are drawn to this girl\r\nas to another of your own kind--but do you suppose that the Kha Niish\r\nwould shape her in Their image? She is like the rest of us, an android\r\ncreature, refashioned by the Masters to suit the environment of each\r\nnew world we visit."\r\n\r\nThe last of the swarming figures vanished into the great cylinder. A\r\nmuted gong-sound thrummed through the night. A voice called, urgently.\r\n\r\n"The Kha Niish did not order us away because men are solving their own\r\nproblems," the alien said. "We leave you to destroy yourselves, as you\r\nwill, because man is one of the rare failures of the Galactic Urge. You\r\nare a race of incorrigibles."\r\n\r\nLater Manson sat woodenly in his gyro, waiting for volition to return,\r\nthe scent of scorched earth and ozone and trampled clover strong in his\r\nnostrils.\r\n\r\n_We Earthmen have another inerrant old saw_, he thought bitterly. _An\r\nexcruciatingly funny one dealing with silk purses and sows\' ears...._\r\n\r\nFor a long time he sat quietly, straining his eyes to follow the last\r\nfaint rocket-streak that arced upward against the stars. Then the\r\nstasis that held him fell away, and he reached for the blast gun that\r\nlay under his feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
