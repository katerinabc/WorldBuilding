Almost--but not quite....\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n                       Planet Stories Fall 1947.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nA silver sphere swam in vague depths. The surrounding frame of\r\nintricate mechanism gave off a soft phosphorescence that strengthened\r\nand faded by turns. A young man, robed in gossamer _vitri_ of richest\r\nhue, leaned over, watching keenly.\r\n\r\nHis fingers moved controls at the bottom of the machine. The silver\r\nsphere leaped upward in the vision plate, swelling like a balloon.\r\nContinents and seas were now visible. Then one area swelled over the\r\nvisor-plate. Gradually a small spot became a city, a strange sprawling\r\ncity. He found a certain street, a certain house, a certain room.\r\n\r\nShe was walking around on the floor of the room, dressed in the scant\r\ncostume of the period of that silver sphere. She never left the floor.\r\nHer body was singularly graceful, her face angelic. Strangely, it\r\nseemed, she had no control over gravity, and was forced to _walk_ or be\r\n_conveyed_ across the surface of her planet.\r\n\r\n"Oh beautiful, primitive girl!" he whispered chokingly, gripping his\r\nfingers tight on the control board before him. "Savage girl of lost\r\nages!"\r\n\r\nThe girl smiled. She seemed to turn directly toward him, and her blue\r\neyes were filled with a dreamy, half-yearning promise, as if she had\r\nheard his words and had answered.\r\n\r\nYet she had never seen him. She didn\'t even know he existed. She\r\ncouldn\'t even imagine the wonders of flashing through interstellar\r\nworlds by use of thought-force, nor picture a means of existing\r\nentirely on basic radiation, sucked from the atoms themselves. This\r\nyoung man, slender and well-proportioned, was a product of endless\r\nevolution and progression. She was a retrograde current of atavism that\r\nhad persisted somehow on one outlaw world.\r\n\r\nSavage, yes! But there was no mistaking the light in Ilon Karth\'s eyes\r\nas he followed every movement of her little graceful body.\r\n\r\nSuddenly an awareness of someone approaching burst into his mentality.\r\nHe wheeled, an expression of annoyance on his face. With an abrupt\r\nmovement of his hand he struck a switch that caused the glowing of the\r\nmachine to die. The sphere, and the lovely girl of that alien globe,\r\nvanished utterly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow the surrounding walls, glowing with light of their own, flickered.\r\nAn ovoid opening in solidity appeared, forced by the mental-push of the\r\napproaching person. The figure of an old man, venerable of appearance,\r\nstooped and robed in the gold-mesh-cloth of the Galax-Mentor, floated\r\ninto the room. The wisdom of ages lay imprinted on the face that was\r\nlike wrinkled parchment beneath the blue emerald set in a forehead\r\nband, denoting his rank in the Supreme Council of Seven. The face lost\r\nits strain of menta-portation, and the old man landed gently at his\r\nside.\r\n\r\n"Greeting, Ilon," greeted Nyo Karth, his eyes darting intelligently\r\nabout the room.\r\n\r\n"Er--Greeting, dad," said Ilon Karth, hiding his irritation. As the\r\nopening had been menta-forced into the room, his hand had darted\r\ninstinctively toward a hidden compartment in the machine. Now he tried\r\nto hide the movement of his hand and what it contained as it sped\r\ntoward the secret pocket again. But the keen eyes of his father saw\r\nand grew narrow and steely with surprise and suspicion. The older man\r\nreached out and grabbed his wrist. In Ilon\'s open palm lay a needle-ray\r\nweapon of defense.\r\n\r\n"What is it you fear, son?" he demanded sternly. "What can you, a\r\nprinceling of your own people, fear here in our own galaxy?"\r\n\r\nIlon Karth averted his eyes. "Has enough tonnage of _ithilyn_ been\r\nremoved from the mines lately?" he asked, ignoring the other\'s question.\r\n\r\n"But there is only one thing to fear," continued his father\r\nwonderingly. "That is the minion spies. The guards of the secret\r\ngalaxy. But what have you done to fear them? Don\'t tell me, Ilon, that\r\nyou have been crazy enough to probe through the dark ultra-universes in\r\nsearch for lower life-forms?"\r\n\r\n"Look, father," said Ilon, indicating the machines. "I perform my\r\nassigned tasks here. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
Those only. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
I supervise the _ithilyn_ mines,\r\nwatching their daily output through the scanner."\r\n\r\nSuddenly a greenish glowing swam through the open air, like the rays of\r\na fairy elfin, settling around the room.\r\n\r\nThe older man gasped. "It\'s the spy-rays of the minions, son! Whatever\r\nyou\'ve been doing, son, blank your mind as I do. When they\'re gone,\r\nwe\'ll go into this foolish thing you\'ve been doing."\r\n\r\nSo they stood at the scanner and inspected the scenes of the lower\r\n_ithilyn_ mines. As Ilon\'s hands moved the controls, various scenes\r\nshifted before them. In the headquarters room, other men such as\r\nhimself raised their heads, smiled and saluted, or answered direct\r\npersonal questions.\r\n\r\nThey came to the digging scenes. Huge giants toiled in a deep hole,\r\nlike larval bodies in cocoons. Rest-time had come. Food had been\r\nshuttled in on a chain of grav-belts. Now the great fingerless hand of\r\nthe giant reached down, felt around expertly, and picked up the food\r\nshuttles. The great eye in his forehead did not waver, for the giant\r\nwas blind. Yet the hand, misformed now into a digging claw, threw the\r\nfood expertly into the huge, gaping maw and the jaws began to chew with\r\nanimal-like gusto.\r\n\r\nThen the elfin glowing was gone. Nyo Karth spun accusingly upon his son.\r\n\r\n"Ilon--my son, my son," he cried in a softly troubled thought tone.\r\n"Have you forgotten, boy, that after all you have a father? And a\r\nfriend? Have you forgotten the person to whom you took all your\r\ntroubles to as a lad?"\r\n\r\nIlon Karth frowned, still averting his eyes. "But I\'m a man now,\r\nfather, faced with the problems of a man of the upper Galax."\r\n\r\n"True, true, son, but--"\r\n\r\n"And if the conventions of an age-old universal society bore me to\r\ndeath, father, then it\'s--"\r\n\r\n"Oh!" cried the older man understandingly, and a smile tugged at his\r\nmouth, which relaxed somewhat. "Then it does not please you that the\r\nHygiene Board has decreed a marriage union be officially recorded in a\r\nfew short star-periods to--"\r\n\r\n"It\'s not that I hate Nyrilla," burst out Ilon. "Not that she isn\'t as\r\nattractive as all women of Coralinth. It\'s simply that I don\'t have\r\nanything to say about it. There\'s no demand for agreement from either\r\nparty. It just happens that her gene-patterns match up and supplement\r\nmine. Our children would be benefited by the mating. At a given time,\r\nsome official moves a hand across a sheet. Two names are written down\r\nand whether or no--it\'s happened. Besides, I don\'t _love_ Nyrilla.\r\nDon\'t you understand, father?"\r\n\r\n"You don\'t--" began the older man, and suddenly his astonishment melted\r\ninto a sunshine of laughter. "Love--eh--you say, boy? 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Love."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe repeated the word softly, as if testing the sound and depth of a\r\nmeaning almost forgotten. "Yes, I remember the term now. So it\'s that."\r\nThen a growing concern replaced his merriment. "But that\'s a thing\r\nof bygone ages, son. You _are_ having a trend. Why not take it to a\r\npsych-treater, son? 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Have it removed from your mind. You\'d be surprised\r\nwhat a beautiful and understanding girl Nyrilla of Coralinth is, once--"\r\n\r\n"Psych-treater! Psych-treater! 

=== Chunk 6 ===
That\'s all you hear! If you have\r\nsomething that bothers you, you forget it in a psych-treater! If you\r\nhave an original thought that tantalizes you--go to a psych-treater!\r\nIs that sensible, father, to forget the problems that may affect the\r\nentire future of your life? Besides, the girl of the silver sphere--"\r\n\r\nThe words had leaped out impatiently. Now Ilon stopped suddenly,\r\nclasping his hand to his temple from where the mental words had burst.\r\nBut too late. Old Nyo was looking intently at him and then was moving\r\ntoward him with sudden wrath on his high brow, his hand upraised as if\r\nto strike him.\r\n\r\nIlon ducked, fearing the blow, but his eyes did not leave the angrily\r\npulsing blood vessels that throbbed on his father\'s forehead.\r\n\r\n"Fool!" spat out Nyo Karth in horrified anger. "Then you have been\r\nbreaking the laws of the Mentors. Plumbing the universe, seeking\r\ncontact with life in lesser forms. Don\'t you realize the gravity of\r\nthis offense? Don\'t you realize you may lose your princeship, be\r\nbanished from the Galax, or even executed?"\r\n\r\nIlon recoiled. "But, father, you wouldn\'t reveal--"\r\n\r\n"Reveal!" exploded Nyo Karth angrily. "Reveal! Yes, that\'s what I will\r\ndo. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
I will take it to the council. You are as insane as the poor blind\r\nmastodons who work like maggots in the mines, whose eyes would be\r\nblasted by a mere ray of the very light for which they were originally\r\nintended. I will demand this madness be erased from your brain. I will\r\ndemand punishment, as your misdemeanor calls for. I will show them that\r\nI stand for justice, even to a son."\r\n\r\nSuddenly he paused. Again a strange glowing of spy-rays pulsed\r\nthrough the room. And then a furious clangor sounded from without. A\r\nmental-wave beat through the barrier.\r\n\r\n"Open up! Open up!" 

=== Chunk 8 ===
It demanded in strident mental tones. "In the name\r\nof the Council of Seven!"\r\n\r\nIlon felt beaten. His father leaped toward him. His eyes blazed into\r\nhis own, and a command leaped out.\r\n\r\n"Resist them! Resist them!"\r\n\r\n"But father--"\r\n\r\n"Resist them, fool, before they open a way into the room. After all, I\r\ncan\'t turn you over to them!"\r\n\r\n"But father--if they should discover you, a Galax-Mentor--"\r\n\r\nThen a wave of relief swept Ilon. Gladly he built up a mental force\r\nthat was thrust around them like a shell. He felt it weaving a network\r\nof resistance, felt it clash with outer forces demanding entrance. The\r\nouter mental cries weakened and vanished momentarily. It would not be\r\nfor long, Ilon knew. The spies, realizing something was amiss, would go\r\nfor help. When they returned, the bombardment would be strengthened to\r\nthe point where resistance would be futile.\r\n\r\n"Quick!" commanded old Nyo. "Get the silver sphere, Ilon."\r\n\r\nIlon grasped his father\'s arm for an instant, saying nothing. Mental\r\ngratitude flowed from his being into old Nyo\'s. His father shook him\r\noff impatiently.\r\n\r\n"The girl!" he spoke again hurriedly. "No time to waste."\r\n\r\n"Then you\'ll take me to her!"\r\n\r\n"More than that, son! I\'ll break all the laws of the Galax. I\'ll bring\r\n_her_ here to you."\r\n\r\n"But I can\'t allow that!" cried Ilon, aghast. "I can\'t allow you--"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut to disobey the order in the older man\'s eyes was impossible. Again\r\nhe manipulated the machine deftly. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
Again the pulsation of light swam\r\nfrom the depths, and the silver sphere emerged, swinging upward. Again\r\nhe found the city, the room--and again the beautiful savage moved in\r\nits depths, humming a song on corraline lips that made Ilon\'s head\r\nswim. Even to look at her made his heart thump and race madly.\r\n\r\nNyo looked, noting the symmetrical trim of a supple body, the barbarian\r\ngrace of her. He nodded in reluctant approval.\r\n\r\n"They\'ll be back, Ilon," he said. "You\'ll have to stand them off while\r\nI work. Think you can do it?

=== Chunk 10 ===
"\r\n\r\nIlon nodded grimly. Nyo had withdrawn from his robe a tiny cylindrical\r\nobject that was like a rod of sheer light. He held the filament before\r\nhim. Now he looked directly at the girl\'s image, distant across\r\nstar-worlds, and his eyes narrowed to mere slits. The muscles of his\r\nbody knotted with exertion. Lambent light leaped from the white sliver\r\nin his hand, darted like lightning to his temple, splayed out again\r\ntoward the distant barbarian world.\r\n\r\nInside the room--the spy-ray danced.\r\n\r\nIt leaped and throbbed, a living thing, moving quickly here and there,\r\nand Ilon built up his desperate force of mental resistance. He felt\r\nan outer demand for entrance, but denied it. Then overwhelming power\r\nblossomed from all sides, cascading down upon him.\r\n\r\nIt was a white heat applied to his brain fibre, a furnace of unknown\r\nforces fanned to utmost intensity. His mind reeled from the impact.\r\nShock raced through his being. He shuddered, feeling the forces\r\nbreaking into the barrier of the room. Hopelessness against greater\r\npowers overwhelmed him.\r\n\r\nThe sight of old Nyo, kneeling now, brought a vibration of despair from\r\nIlon\'s inner being. If they discovered his father, the Galax-Mentor,\r\nbreaking the law....\r\n\r\nEnergy came back out of nothingness. Again he flung himself into the\r\nstruggle with forces interlocked in the etherical strains of matter.\r\nFor a long moment he tensed, denying them any thought entrance. And\r\nhe held! 

=== Chunk 11 ===
He held! And the lightning forces that had leaped from Nyo\'s\r\nbrain across the universe were creating a white nimbus entirely around\r\nthe girl--the girl of the silver sphere.\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly--\r\n\r\nSuddenly she was no longer in that distant barbaric world. She was\r\nhere--standing before them. No longer light-years away, but swung\r\nacross a space-warp created by the mind pulsations of old Nyo.\r\n\r\nAnd as abruptly--\r\n\r\nCrimson lips lost their curve of happiness. A scream burst from her\r\nlips and went shuddering through the air. Her eyes opened--but blindly.\r\nUnseeingly. Her hands reached up to clutch at--blindness!\r\n\r\nOne moment--of utter fantastic horror. One moment when her body swayed\r\nand fell and writhed and twisted in unutterable pain. One moment when\r\nher beauty was crushed by a sledge-hammer of unspeakable anguish.\r\n\r\nAnd as suddenly she was gone. As suddenly, she was back again in the\r\nroom of the distant world, and the silver sphere was hurtling back into\r\nthe remote depths.\r\n\r\nIlon\'s mind reeled. He felt resistance crumbling. The solid barriers of\r\nthe room were melting. He staggered. Solidity vanished. Figures--grim\r\nand demanding--leaped in. He was helpless before them. But old Nyo\'s\r\nmind flashed out, indignant and hot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Ilon\'s mind reeled. He felt resistance crumbling._]\r\n\r\n"What is this!" his father was thundering. "Spies intruding upon a\r\nGalax-Mentor! What would you have?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIlon saw the suddenly startled faces of the many spies, saw their\r\nbewilderment, their wonder and fear. They retreated hurriedly,\r\nsheepishly. 

=== Chunk 12 ===
In a moment the room was whole again. Ilon felt stunned.\r\n\r\nMemory of the girl\'s unseeing pain crushed him. His father\'s arm was\r\nabout his shoulders now.\r\n\r\n"Come, Ilon," said Nyo. "The variable-star Necktor has changed three\r\ntimes. Another moment, and your union with Nyrilla will have been\r\nrecorded. You must go to meet her. It is the time-old custom of the\r\nGalax."\r\n\r\n"But the girl, father, the girl of the silver sphere...."\r\n\r\n"I disobeyed the laws of the Galax, son, and brought her here for an\r\ninstant, so that you might understand. Our race of beings is a glorious\r\nrace, son. It has come across vast universes, across unthinkable aeons\r\nof time, and across unmeasurable dimensions of space. Somewhere along\r\nthe paths, seeds have been lost, and life remained in retrograde\r\nplaces--like this little planet you have just witnessed.\r\n\r\n"This silver sphere has floated forever in several surrounding seas\r\nof--force--shall we say, son. Gravity--atmosphere--and several other\r\nenergies of which we will not speak.\r\n\r\n"But several faculties--such as we know them--menta-portation,\r\nradiance-life--are impossible under the layers of atmospheric\r\nmolecules. Though the power for menta-portation lies dormant in their\r\nbodies, as in our own, their atmosphere prevented its use.\r\n\r\n"So--as the mastodons in the mines are blind because they have not seen\r\nlight--so are the people of the silver sphere without true powers of\r\nthe mind, because they have never been able to use them.\r\n\r\n"When I transported her here, the sudden comprehension of these powers\r\nwould have killed her in another instant. So I sent her back, Ilon,\r\nback to her own true world. Have I done rightly, son? 

=== Chunk 13 ===
Will you go now\r\nto Nyrilla?"\r\n\r\nIlon reached out for the strength of his father\'s arm. Memory of the\r\ngirl, her pliant erectness, her sheer beauty, was like a racing livid\r\nfire in his mind.\r\n\r\nHe would have to forget her--and go on loving her. He would have to\r\nleave her unnamed, unknown, a savage creature in her own primitive\r\nworld. And though her memory never quite went from his mind, well, that\r\nwas something to be faced. For her own sake he would never dare again\r\nto think of bridging the space that separated them.\r\n\r\n"Let us go, father," he said.\r\n\r\nSoftly their bodies arose. As lightly as feathers they floated through\r\nan opening in the barrier that came at their mere wishing....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCheryl Ramsden, torch singer for the _Midnight Club_, screamed just\r\nonce in her apartment. They found her prostrate and writhing, as though\r\nfrom the after-effects of a seizure.\r\n\r\n"Nerves!" the physician pronounced it. "Better take it easy, girl!"\r\n\r\n"Look, doc," cried Cheryl. "I ain\'t going nuts, am I? For an instant it\r\nwas like swimming through space. Suddenly it was like being inside a\r\nflame, with every part of me going up in ashes and...."\r\n\r\nThe doctor looked very serious, as if he felt the surge of forces that\r\nhad swept her up. Then he shrugged his shoulders as though to say some\r\nthings were better to be left unnamed and guessed at.\r\n\r\n"That\'s what comes of too much torch singing," he said lightly, and\r\nbeing young and not immune to beauty, he smiled encouragingly and with\r\ndepth. "Maybe you\'ve been burning the torch at both ends, Cheryl."\r\n\r\n"What would you suggest, Doctor--"\r\n\r\n"Mudd! Phineas Axelton Mudd!--mi-lady!"\r\n\r\n"How horrible! Did your parents actually tack that onto you or was it\r\ninvented to torture your patients?"\r\n\r\n"A little of both, but I\'d recommend a long drive into the country,\r\nmaybe a swim at the seashore--"\r\n\r\n"In the company of a young doctor, red-haired, by the name of Mudd?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I didn\'t say that, Cheryl, but could be, gal, could be."\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
