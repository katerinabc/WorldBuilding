The ship from Earth was still two days away, and\r\nthe Martian flagship would get in next morning, with seven hundred\r\npassengers for Earth on it. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
Dworken must have been waiting in Luna City\r\na whole week--at six thousand credits a day. That\'s as steep to me as it\r\nis to you, but money never seemed to worry Dworken.\r\n\r\nHe raised the heavy green lids from his protruding brown eyes as I came\r\nin. He waved his tail.\r\n\r\n"Sit down and join me," he invited, in his guttural voice. "It is not\r\ngood for a man to drink alone. But I haf no combany in dis\r\nby-de-gods-deserted hole. A man must somet\'ing be doing, what?"\r\n\r\nI sat down in the booth across from my Venusian friend, and stared at\r\nhim while he punched a new order into the drinkboard.\r\n\r\n"For me, another _shchikh_," he announced. "And for you? 

=== Chunk 3 ===
De same?"\r\n\r\nAgainst my better judgment, for I knew I\'d have plenty to do handling\r\nthat mob of tourists--the first crowd of the season is always the\r\nroughest--tomorrow, I consented. Dworken had already consumed six of the\r\nexplosive things, as the empty glasses on the table showed, but he\r\nexhibited no effects. I made a mental note, as I\'d so often done before,\r\nthat this time I would not exceed the safe terrestrial limit of two.\r\n\r\n"You must be in the money again, drinking imported _shchikh_," I\r\nremarked. "What are you doing in Luna City this time?"\r\n\r\nHe merely lifted his heavy eyelids and stared at me without expression.\r\n\r\n"Na, in de money I am not. Dere are too many chiselers in business. Just\r\nwhen I t\'ink I haf a goot t\'ing, I am shwindeled. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
It is too bad." He\r\nsnorted through his ugly snout, making the Venusian equivalent of a\r\nsigh. I knew there was a story waiting behind that warty skin, but I was\r\nnot sure I wanted to hear it. For the next round of drinks would be on\r\nme, and _shchikh_ was a hundred and fifty credits a shot. Still, a man\r\non a Moon assignment has to amuse himself somehow.\r\n\r\nSo I said, "What\'s the latest episode in the Dworken soap opera? What is\r\nthe merchandise this time? Gems? Pet Mercurian fire-insects? A new\r\nsupply of _danghaana_?"\r\n\r\n"I do not smuggle drugs, dat is a base lie," replied my friend stolidly.\r\nHe knew, of course, that I still suspected him to be the source of the\r\nlast load of that potent narcotic, although I had no more proof than did\r\nthe Planetary Bureau of Investigation.\r\n\r\nHe took a long pull at his drink before he spoke again. "But Dworken is\r\nnever down for long. Dis time it is show business. You remember, how I\r\nhaf always been by de t\'eater so fascinated? Well, I decided to open a\r\nshow here in Luna City. T\'ink of all the travelers, bored stiff by space\r\nand de emptiness thereof, who pass through here during the season. Even\r\nif only half of them go to my show, it cannot fail."\r\n\r\nI waited for some mention of free tickets, but none was made. I was\r\nabout as anxious to see Dworken\'s show as I was to walk barefoot across\r\nthe Mare Imbrium, but I asked with what enthusiasm I could force,\r\n\r\n"What sort of act are you putting on? Girls?" I shuddered as I recalled\r\nthe pathetic shop-worn chorus girls that Sam Low had tried to pass off\r\nlast year on the gullible tourists of the spaceways. That show had\r\nlasted ten nights--nine more than it deserved to. There are limits, even\r\nto the gullibility of Earth-lubbers.\r\n\r\n"Yes, girls," replied Dworken. "But not what you are perhaps t\'inking.\r\nMartian girls."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis was more interesting. Even if the girls were now a little too old\r\nfor the stage in the Martian capital, they would still get loud cheers\r\non the Moon. I knew. I started to say so, but Dworken interrupted.\r\n\r\n"And not de miserable girls dey buy from de slave traders in Behastin.\r\nDese girls I collected myself, from de country along de Upper Canal."\r\n\r\nI repressed my impulse to show my curiosity. It could all be perfectly\r\ntrue--and if it were not the opening night would tell. But it sounded a\r\nlot like one of Dworken\'s taller tales. I had never been able to\r\ndisprove any one of them, but I found it a _little_ hard to believe that\r\nso many improbable things had ever happened to one man. However, I like\r\nbeing entertained, if it doesn\'t cost me too much, so finally I said,\r\n\r\n"I suppose you are going to tell me you ventured out into the interior\r\nof Mars, carrying a six weeks\' supply of water and oxygen on your back,\r\nand visited the Xo theaters on the spot?"\r\n\r\n"How did you know? 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Dat is just what I did," solemnly affirmed my\r\ncompanion. He snorted again, and looked at his glass. It was empty, but\r\nhe tilted it into his face again in an eloquent gesture. No words were\r\nneeded: I punched the symbols for _shchikh_ into the drinkboard on my\r\nside of the table. Then, after hesitating, I punched the "two in"\r\nsignal. I must remember, though, that this was my second and last.\r\n\r\nHis eighth _shchikh_ seemed to instill some animation into Dworken. "I\r\nknow you feel skepticality--I mean skepticism--after my exploits. You\r\nwill see tomorrow night dat I speak true."\r\n\r\n"Amazing!" I said. "Especially as I just happen to remember that three\r\ndifferent expeditions from Earth tried to penetrate more than a hundred\r\nkilometers from Behastin, but either they couldn\'t carry the water and\r\noxygen that far, or they resorted to breathing Mars air, and never came\r\nback. And they were Earthmen, not Venusians who are accustomed to two\r\natmospheres of carbon dioxide."\r\n\r\n"My vriend, you must not reason: it was so, it always will be so. The\r\nbrinciple of induction is long exbloded. I did indeed breathe Mars air.\r\nVait! I tell you how."\r\n\r\nHe took another long swig of _shchikh_. "Vat your Eart\'men did not\r\nrealize was dat dey cannot acclimate themselves as do we Venusians. You\r\nknow de character of our planet made adaptability a condition of\r\nsurvival. It is true dat our atmosphere is heavy, but on top of our\r\nso-high mountains de air is t\'in. We must live everywhere, de space is\r\nso few. I first adapted myself on Eart\' to live. I was dere a whole\r\nyear, you vill recollect. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Den I go further. Your engineers construct air\r\ntanks dat make like de air of mountains, t\'in. So, I learn to live in\r\ndose tanks. Each day I haf spent one, two, three hours in dem. I get so\r\nI can breathe air at one-third the pressure of your already t\'in\r\natmosphere. And at one-sixt\' the tension of oxygen. No, my vriend, you\r\ncould not do this. Your lungs burst. But old Dworken, he has done it.\r\n\r\n"I take wit\' me only some water, for I know de Martians dey not give\r\nwater. To trade, some miniature kerosene lamps. You know dey got no fuel\r\noil now, only atomics, but dese little lamps dey like for antiques, for\r\nsentiment, because their great-grandfathers used dem.\r\n\r\n"Well, I walk through Vlahas, and not stop. Too close by the capital.\r\nToo much contact with men of odder planets. I walk also through Bhur and\r\nZamat. I come to a small place where dey never see foreigner. Name\r\nTasaaha. Oh, I tell you, ze men of ze odder planets do not know Mars.\r\nHow delightful, how unsboiled, are ze Martians, once you get away from\r\nde people by tourists so sboiled! How wonderful, across the sands to go,\r\nfree as birds! The so friendly greetings of de Martian men. And de\r\nMartian women! _Ah!_\r\n\r\n"Well, in Tasaaha I go to t\'eater. Such lovely girls! 

=== Chunk 7 ===
You shall see. But\r\nI saw somet\'ing else. That, my friend, you hardly believe!"\r\n\r\nDworken looked down at his empty glass and snorted gently. I took the\r\nhint, although for myself I ordered the less lethal Martian _azdzani_. I\r\nwas already having difficulty believing parts of his narrative; it would\r\nbe interesting to see if the rest were any harder.\r\n\r\nMy companion continued. "They not only have de chorus, which you haf\r\nseen on Earth, imported from Mars--and such a chorus! Such girls! But\r\nthey had somet\'ing else."\r\n\r\n"You recall your terrestrial history? Once your ancestors had performers\r\non the stage who did funny motions and said amusing remarks, de\r\nspectators to make laugh. I t\'ink you called it \'vaudeville.\' Well, on\r\nMars they have also vaudeville!" He paused, and looked at me from under\r\nhalf-shut eyelids, and grinned widely to show his reptilian teeth.\r\n\r\nI wondered if he\'d really found something new. I would even be willing\r\nto pay for a glimpse of Martian vaudeville. I wondered if my Martian was\r\ntoo rusty for me to understand jokes in the spoken lingo.\r\n\r\n"They haf not only men and women telling jokes. They haf trained animals\r\nacting funny!" Dworken went on.\r\n\r\nThis was too much. "I suppose the animals talked, too?" I said\r\nsarcastically. "Do they speak Earth or Martian?"\r\n\r\nHe regarded me approvingly. "My friend, you catch on quick." He raised a\r\npaw. "Now, don\'t at conclusions jump. Let me exblain. At first, I did\r\nnot believe it either.\r\n\r\n"Dey sprang it with no warning. Onto de stage came a _tllooll_ (you know\r\nhim, I t\'ink), and a _shiyooch\'iid_. The _shiyooch\'iid_ was riding a\r\nbicycle--I mean a monocle. One wheel. The _tllooll_ moved just as\r\nawkward as he always does, and tried to ride a tandem four-wheeled\r\nvehicle which had been especially for him made."\r\n\r\nIn spite of my resolve, I chuckled. The picture of a _tllooll_ trying to\r\nride a four-wheeled bicycle, pumping each of his eight three-jointed\r\nlegs up and down in turn, while maintaining his usual supercilious and\r\nindifferent facial expression, was irresistibly funny.\r\n\r\n"Wait!" said my friend, and again raised a paw. "You have as yet not\'ing\r\nheard. They make jokes at same time. De _shiyooch\'iid_ asks de\r\n_tllooll_, \'Who was dat _tlloolla_ I saw you wit\' up the Canal?\' and the\r\n_tllooll_ replies, \'Dat was no _tlloolla_, dat was my _shicai_.\'"\r\n\r\nI doubled up, laughing. Unless you have visited Mars this may not strike\r\nyou as funny, but I collapsed into a heap. I put my head on the table\r\nand wept with mirth.\r\n\r\nIt seemed like five minutes before I was able to speak. "Oh, no!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, I tell you. Yes!" 

=== Chunk 8 ===
insisted my friend. He even smiled himself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf you don\'t know the social system of the Martians there is no point in\r\nmy trying to explain why the idea of a _tllooll\'s_ being out with that\r\nneuter of neuters, a _shicai_, is so devastatingly funny. But that,\r\nsuddenly, was not quite the point.\r\n\r\n_Did it happen?_ I had large doubts. Nobody had ever heard a _tllooll_\r\nmake any sort of a sound, and it was generally supposed that they had no\r\nvocal chords. And no _shiyooch\'iid_ (they somewhat resemble a big\r\ngroundhog, and live in burrows along the canals of Mars) had ever been\r\nheard to make any noise except a high-pitched whistle when frightened.\r\n\r\n"Now, just a minute, Dworken," I said.\r\n\r\n"I know, my vriend. I know. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
You t\'ink it is impossible. You t\'ink the\r\ntalking is faked. So I t\'ought too. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
But vait."\r\n\r\nIt seems Dworken had inquired among the audience as to who owned the\r\nperforming animals. The local Martians were not as impressed as he was\r\nwith the performance, but they guided him to the proprietor of the\r\ntrained animal act. He was a young Martian, hawk-nosed, with flashing\r\nblack eyes, dusky skin, and curly hair.\r\n\r\n"So I say to him, dis Martian," Dworken continued, "\'If your act on the\r\nlevel is, I buy.\' I had three small diamonds with," he explained.\r\n\r\n"But de Martian was hard to deal wit\'. First, he said he vould not sell\r\nhis so-valuable and so-beloved animals. De only talking animals on Mars,\r\nhe said--de liar! At long last I get him to make a price. But, on\r\ncondition dat he bring ze animals around to my inn in the morning, for a\r\nprivate audition."\r\n\r\n"I suppose," I interrupted, "you were beginning to have some doubts as\r\nto the Martian\'s good faith? After all, a talking _tllooll_ and a\r\ntalking _shiyooch\'iid_ all at one time is quite a lot to ask. I would\r\nhave--"\r\n\r\n"Blease, vriend, blease!" interrupted my companion. "Do you not t\'ink\r\nold Dworken knows dese things? Of course he does! I t\'ink. De owner, he\r\nis pulling a fake, I guess. I know dat animals do not really talk.\r\n\r\n"Next morning, I t\'ink he no show up. But no, I am mistaken. Bromptly at\r\nnine o\'clock he come to my inn with a little dogcart, wit\' de animals.\r\nHe puts dem on de stage in de bar of de inn. They act like before."\r\n\r\n"But they didn\'t talk, of course?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, my vriend, dat\'s where you are wrong. Dey talk like nobotty\'s\r\nbusiness. De jokes are funnier than ever. Even dirtier, maybe. But\r\nDworken is not fooled. He t\'ink. \'Aha!\' I say to de Martian, \'You fake\r\nthis, what? De animals not talk. Suppose you have them do de act while\r\nyou outside stay, what?\' Then I t\'ink I have him.\r\n\r\n"Ze Martian tear his curly hair, flash his black eyes. He takes insult\r\nthat I t\'ink he is fake. \'Name of de Martian gods!\' he cry. But at last\r\nhe agree to go away, and tell animals to go ahead."\r\n\r\n"Dworken, you were a sap to string along with him even that far," I said\r\nwearily. "I hope you hadn\'t paid the guy any money."\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
"No, my old and best," he said. "Dworken no fool is,\r\neven on Mars. No, no money. But wait! De animals go on without the\r\nowner. Same stage business, same talk, same jokes, and even funnier\r\nyedt. What?"\r\n\r\nI started at Dworken. He did not smile, but finished off the eleventh\r\n_shchikh_--the fifth I had bought him.\r\n\r\n"Listen," I said. "Are you sitting there telling me you have a _tllooll_\r\nand a _shiyooch\'iid_ that can really talk?"\r\n\r\n"You listen, my vriend. Like you, I t\'ink something is wrong. I say to\r\nMartian owner, \'My vriend, maybe I buy your act, if you tell me how it\r\nis done. But you know as well as I do dat it is impossible to dese\r\nanimals to talk. Tell me what is de trick?\'"\r\n\r\nDworken lifted his glass and shook it, as though he could not believe it\r\nwas empty, then looked at me questioningly. I shook my head. He snorted,\r\nlooked melancholy, writhed up from his chair and reached for his fur\r\ncape.\r\n\r\n"Vell, thanks for de drinks," he said.\r\n\r\nA dark suspicion crept into my mind, but I could not restrain myself.\r\n\r\n"Wait, Dworken!" I shouted. "You can\'t just leave me up in the air like\r\nthat! 

=== Chunk 12 ===
What happened then?"\r\n\r\nDworken snorted into his green handkerchief.\r\n\r\n"De Martian admitted it was a fake, after all," he said mournfully. "Can\r\nyou imachine it? What a chiseler!\r\n\r\n"\'De _shiyooch\'iid_,\' he said, \'can\'t really talk; de _tllooll_ just\r\nt\'rows his voice!\'"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _If Worlds of Science Fiction_ November\r\n    1953.
