They were\r\n           waiting for him too--that is, for his corpse....\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Imagination Stories of Science and Fantasy\r\n                              April 1954\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Greene shook his shaggy head and studied Allerton with patient\r\neyes. "You\'re making a mistake," he said. "You\'ll be back."\r\n\r\nThe inside of the spaceship was quiet now, not with the silence of the\r\ntomb, but with the silence of barely inaudible echoes as if Allerton\r\nmight still be able to hear the crew clomping about the companionways\r\non metal-shod feet if only he knew how to listen. He buried the notion\r\nunder the sweet anticipation of homecoming and said, "I don\'t think so,\r\nCaptain. This is what I want, right here." He tapped the comforting\r\nbulk of his wallet, bulging the metallic cloth of his tunic.\r\n\r\nHe was a gaunt, comical figure of a man, so long and lean that he\r\nstooped slightly at the waist and again at the shoulders, with a long,\r\ndown-tipped nose which almost seemed to meet the thin-lipped mouth as\r\nhe spoke. "What about you, Captain?" he said. He was still savoring the\r\njoy of his own return, letting it build up inside him like a slow fire\r\nfanned by barely enough air to keep it kindled. He hardly cared whether\r\nCaptain Greene disembarked or not, but the captain\'s unexpected lack\r\nof enthusiasm was a splendid counter-point for his own emotions and he\r\nwanted to wring every last drop of joy from his homecoming. "All the\r\nmen are gone," he went on. "This is Earth, Captain."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t leave the ship much these days, Allerton. I\'ve got to complete\r\nthe log, you know, then do a little advance astronauting for the trip\r\nout. Anyway, none of the others are spacemen, Allerton. An old spacedog\r\nlike me can smell \'em a mile away--the real ones. You\'ve got the\r\nmakings, all right."\r\n\r\n"You won\'t see me aboard the _Eros_ again, though. I grew up in the\r\ndepression of the eighties, Captain. What I\'m looking for is security.\r\nI\'ve got it right here--enough to start a business of my own and give\r\nmy kid the kind of education he needs these days. Three years is a\r\nlong time, but I tried to be a good spaceman."\r\n\r\n"You were the best."\r\n\r\n"Those kids running around after adventure, they\'ll be back. They\'re\r\nmade for this life. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
They\'re too young and having too much fun to start\r\nthinking much about security. But now, you take me...."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll have to make the decision yourself," Captain Greene\r\nadmitted, leaning back comfortably with a cigar and reaching for his\r\nleather-bound log, his stubby fingers almost caressing the leaves with\r\na love nurtured on long familiarity. "We blast off in a week," he said.\r\n"Enough time for you to decide, I guess."\r\n\r\n"But I\'ve already decided, sir." Allerton turned to go, stooping\r\nforward even more than usual to fit through the low doorway which, like\r\nanything else in the tight confines of a spaceship, was not made to\r\naccommodate his gangling figure.\r\n\r\n"Well, don\'t forget this. You\'re wrong about the others. They\'re not\r\nfor space, not the way you are. It\'s a common misconception. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Good luck,\r\nAllerton."\r\n\r\nBut Allerton was already on his way down the companionway with its\r\nghost-noises which he no longer could hear. He wondered what it really\r\ntook to make a man happy, truly happy over a sustained period. The\r\nflitting stolen moments of a spaceman\'s life, he knew, could never be\r\nfor him. Yet outside the rain drummed down drearily on the gray apron\r\nof the landing pit and washed over Allerton with an ineffable sadness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe reporters were waiting for him down below, huddled together under a\r\nbobbing sea of umbrellas. He failed to understand why anyone should be\r\nwaiting in the rain like that.\r\n\r\n"I\'m from the _Star-Herald_," one of the umbrella-shrouded faces told\r\nhim, the voice steady and without highlight, like the rain. "Have you\r\nheard the news yet?"\r\n\r\n"News?" demanded Allerton as he went down the ramp to the apron and was\r\nsoon swallowed up by the sea of umbrellas.\r\n\r\n"You\'re Allerton, aren\'t you?"\r\n\r\nAn aisle was cleared as Allerton drew a slicker from his duffle and\r\npulled it across his shoulders. Flash-cameras glared briefly against\r\nthe dusky sky, making him blink his eyes uncomfortably.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'m Allerton, but I haven\'t heard any news."\r\n\r\nIt was a woman\'s voice this time, sharp and precise as a pencil point.\r\n"The _Eros_ was gone for three years, Mr. Allerton, on a one year\r\ntrip. Sixteen months ago you were presumed to be lost. You were legally\r\ndead a year ago."\r\n\r\n"Here I am," said Allerton foolishly. "Here we are." He wished they\r\nwould all go away so he could check in at the administration building.\r\nHe thought that the copter-cabs might be grounded by the low ceiling\r\nand realized his homecoming, two years tardy, would be delayed still\r\nfurther because it would take him hours to get home to his wife and\r\nson. "We had some trouble in the Jovian Moons," he said unnecessarily,\r\nfor the rest of the crew must have made that fact known by now.\r\n"Really, I\'m no hero."\r\n\r\nIt had been largely through Allerton\'s efforts, as noncommissioned\r\nofficer in charge of maintenance and repair, that the _Eros_ had\r\nbeen able to blast off from Io at all. It was a moment he had not\r\nconsidered, this hero\'s welcome. His picture and the story of his\r\nexploits might appear on the video newscasts even before he reached\r\nNancy and the boy. But now that he had stooped low to be included\r\nin the protection of the umbrellas, he could see the faces of the\r\nreporters.\r\n\r\nThis was no hero\'s welcome. Allerton waited for what was to come with\r\na growing sense of the ridiculous. He had been almost ready to sign\r\nautographs.\r\n\r\n"Hasn\'t anyone told you your wife has re-married, Mr. Allerton?"\r\n\r\nThe rain marched across the umbrellas with incessantly scurrying feet.\r\nThe space below them was heavy with cigarette smoke, like a small,\r\npoorly-ventilated room, and with the muted sound of many voices, keyed\r\nlow--anxious but objective. Allerton could almost see the scores of\r\npencils, ready to pounce upon the blank pages of the ruled pads and\r\nscribble his name across the hemisphere, the world.\r\n\r\n"What are you telling me?" demanded Allerton. He had heard. Even now\r\nthe words were etching themselves in his brain, stirring old memories,\r\nconjuring impossible visions. This was the sort of thing you saw on the\r\nvideo-casts and tch-tch\'d about, then went upstairs with your wife and\r\ntook her in your arms and thought, are the people that happens to real?\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Allerton was married again ten months ago. In an interview this\r\nmorning she said she was glad you were alive but loved her husband,\r\nher new husband I mean, that is, the man she married because she\r\nthought you were dead." It was the girl-reporter again, the brittle,\r\npencil-point quality gone from her voice.\r\n\r\nAllerton subdued a wild impulse to say something flippant. Suddenly, it\r\nwas as if he had indeed died out there in space and now he was a ghost,\r\ncoming home to haunt people who wanted only to forget. The reporters\r\nexpected him to say something, though. Tell them that he had spent\r\nthree years in space, hating every minute of it, to find security for\r\nhis family? Tell them he had risked his life to repair the ship on Io\r\nbecause if he failed the government insurance would provide for his\r\nfamily? Tell them he was now dead, really dead as Nancy had thought,\r\nand they were wasting their time interviewing a ghost?\r\n\r\n"Have you any plans, Mr. Allerton?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry, I didn\'t hear you." The rain had slackened. He heard his\r\nown heart, hammering in his throat and ears.\r\n\r\n"What are your plans for the future, Mr. Allerton? Are you going to\r\ncontest the marriage legally? Will you see your wife at all?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said Allerton mechanically. "I don\'t know. I don\'t\r\nknow. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
I don\'t know." He pushed his way through the crowd of reporters,\r\na tall but stooped figure, averting his eyes from the umbrella ribs.\r\nHe had been married to Nancy only six months before shipping out, had\r\nreceived word about the birth of their son at the last mail-station on\r\nCeres. If she sought the same security he wanted, he could not find it\r\nin his heart to condemn her. He was dead. He had been waiting to live\r\nall his life, but now he was dead.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"All right, spacer. On your feet. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
We\'re closing."\r\n\r\nHis bleary eyes squinted. _It was Johnny this and Johnny that and\r\nJohnny_ ... Kipling? Someone?\r\n\r\n"We got nothing against spacers here, only when we close, we close.\r\nI\'ll make you something to eat if you want, but that\'s it."\r\n\r\n"No. No, thank you."\r\n\r\n"A bit too much to drink, eh?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be O.K. I\'m sorry if I--"\r\n\r\n"Forget it. Here, let me help you to the door. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Easy, now."\r\n\r\nHe was outside, the duffle balanced on his lean shoulder, the misty\r\ndrizzle chilling him at once, the wet sidewalk casting his reflection\r\nand alternately swallowing and elongating his shadow as he made his way\r\ndown the street past the spaced lamplights.\r\n\r\nSooner or later, he would see her. He had to see her and the child, who\r\nwas now almost three years old. But what did you do, walk in the front\r\ndoor and say hello Mrs. (name of new husband), I\'m the man you used\r\nto be married to? Perhaps, he thought, you wrote a letter instead, a\r\ndear-John in reverse. But that way you did not get to see the boy.\r\n\r\nCertainly, you saw none of your old friends. Tough luck, old fellow.\r\nSomething about more fish in the sea. Pat your back and introduce you\r\nto two or three one-tracked-minded bachelor girls as the conquering\r\nhero from Io and other faraway places. And you did not even venture\r\ninto the old neighborhood until you were ready for the quick sally, the\r\nfirst visit to Nancy and the boy (and the new husband?) and departure.\r\n\r\nNancy loved her husband, the girl-reporter said. Nancy had loved him.\r\nSimple logic: Nancy loved husbands, present tense. Security. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
What he\r\nsought. Safe in a circumscribed world, in comfortable, middle-class\r\nconformity, free and clear of all intrusions except the mortgage and\r\nthe payments on the new copter and scraped knees for junior.\r\n\r\nHe wondered how many bars he had visited, starting with the spaceport\r\nadministration building. There was a hazy recollection of copter-cabs\r\nand surface-cabs, of smiling, vapid faces and other smiling faces,\r\nnot vapid, when the video-cast appeared on a television screen in\r\none of the bars and there he was, squinting against the flash-camera\r\nglare, the rain seeping through the roof of umbrellas and rolling down\r\nhis long, gaunt face and off the thin, long, drooping nose. And then\r\nsomeone recognized him or he recognized himself and drunkenly announced\r\nhis identity, he wasn\'t sure which, and someone had bought drinks for\r\neveryone celebrating Allerton\'s return to blessed bachelorhood and they\r\nall had a fine old time except Allerton who had soon taken his leave\r\nand another cab and another bar.\r\n\r\nNow the streets were familiar. There was the long, low bulk of the\r\npie-wedge supermarket, big and wide in front and tapering in the rear,\r\nwith great sweep of thermo-glass window staring at him and reflecting\r\nhim in the lamplight so he could stare at himself.\r\n\r\nAnd there was the schoolyard playground, deserted now, the swings\r\nwet and the teeter-totters dripping and the slicky-slide glistening.\r\nWhat does a man think about when he\'s out in space and knows he\r\nprobably won\'t return? thought Allerton. About slicky-slides and a boy\r\nhollering in glee with an unknown voice out of an unknown face. And\r\nthere were the apartment buildings, flanking their courtyard with\r\nthe look of solid strength that only brick can give in this age of\r\nglass and plaster. He wondered if Nancy still had their old Republic\r\nfamily-copter parked on the roof near the television antenna, and then\r\nit suddenly occurred to him that Nancy might not be living here at all.\r\n\r\nHe wouldn\'t visit her, not yet. It was curiosity and not longing which\r\nmade him enter the courtyard and the lobby of the second building on\r\nthe left, past the dark, perfectly-cropped rows of California privet\r\nwhich in another few months would lose their glossy leaves to the\r\ncoming of winter.\r\n\r\nThe illuminated dial of his wrist-watch told him it was 0230, hardly\r\nthe time to go calling on a woman and her new husband and a child\r\nhe had never seen. But there was the name, his name, opposite the\r\napartment number on the call-phone. Allerton, with a hyphen after\r\nit, and the name Chambers. The widow Allerton lived here with her\r\nnew husband, the legally declared widow Allerton who probably still\r\nreceived some mail and some callers under the old name but would one\r\nday soon be able to take Allerton and the hyphen out and leave Chambers\r\nalone. Nancy Chambers, his wife.\r\n\r\nHe pressed the buzzer and then drew back, startled. He was about\r\nto leave the lobby and run out between the rows of privet and keep\r\non running when he heard his wife\'s voice, metallically, over the\r\ncall-phone. "Yes? Who is it?"\r\n\r\nHe walked back and stared at the rows of names and buzzers. "Harry," he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nThere was a sob, a sucking in of breath. "I\'ll come right down."\r\n\r\n"I\'m coming up."\r\n\r\nIt was simple. It was as simple as waiting for the buzzer, opening the\r\ndoor, waiting for the elevator, pressing another button, waiting to be\r\ncarried to the twelfth floor, waiting for the door to slide, walking\r\nacross the hall to the apartment door, waiting for it to open, waiting,\r\nwaiting, waiting....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"I hoped you would come, Harry. Really, I wanted to see you. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
You\'re\r\nlooking well."\r\n\r\n"You\'re looking well, too." She was. She wore a dressing gown of\r\nsome gossamer material over her flannel pajamas. She\'d never liked\r\nnightgowns.\r\n\r\n"Nice trip back?"\r\n\r\n"Long one."\r\n\r\n"Weather bad? No, there\'s no weather up there."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t complain."\r\n\r\n"Did you have anything to eat?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t bother. I only wanted to say hello." Goodbye, he meant.\r\n\r\n"Harry\'s asleep now."\r\n\r\n"Harry?"\r\n\r\n"Your son."\r\n\r\n"Oh."\r\n\r\n"He goes to bed at eight o\'clock."\r\n\r\nHe made the automatic adjustment. Twenty hundred hours. "Is he well?"\r\n\r\n"Couldn\'t be better. Eats well and everything."\r\n\r\n"Like his old man, huh?"\r\n\r\n"You want to come in?" But she stood blocking the doorway.\r\n\r\n"No, don\'t bother. Have you a solidio of him or something?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll get it."\r\n\r\nHe stood there in the hall, awkwardly, waiting.\r\n\r\nShe came back. "Here."\r\n\r\nThe other Harry was a dimple-cheeked boy with blond hair and a small\r\nnose like his mother\'s. He was wearing a junior spaceman\'s suit and\r\npointed a ray gun straight at you.\r\n\r\n"Thank you."\r\n\r\n"Sure you don\'t want anything to eat?" She wore a pleasant enough\r\nexpression on her face, the same as she might use for a door to door\r\nsolicitor or a visiting great-aunt from out of town.\r\n\r\n"That\'s all right. I want to wish you good luck, Nancy."\r\n\r\n"Thank you. Are you sure you don\'t want...." And then the pleasant\r\nlook melted before tears, not slowly but all at once, so that this was\r\na different person standing in the doorway and Harry Allerton wanted\r\neither to take her in his arms and comfort her or flee for the elevator\r\nbut nothing in between. "Harry ... Harry ... I didn\'t know ... I\r\ncouldn\'t ... we never...."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all right," he said, settling for the in between and abruptly\r\nhating himself not for what was within him but for what was outside,\r\nfor the world and its conventions and the things he had wanted to do\r\nbut never could and the security he had wanted to earn but which now\r\nhad eluded him.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry I carried on so," said Nancy, the conventional smile\r\nreturning, the tears kleenex\'d away.\r\n\r\n"If there is something little Harry needs...?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, thank you. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
His father, I mean my husband--Mr. Chambers is an\r\nengineer over at Grumman and everything is fine."\r\n\r\n"I guess I\'ll be going.

=== Chunk 10 ===
"\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad you could come."\r\n\r\n"Does the boy know about me?"\r\n\r\n"No. I thought it would be better."\r\n\r\n"Of course, Nancy. You did the right thing."\r\n\r\n"I was hoping you would think so."\r\n\r\n"You couldn\'t do anything else."\r\n\r\n"Where will you go now? Are you going to make a career of space?"\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t thought about it. There\'s no hurry."\r\n\r\n"Well...."\r\n\r\n"Well...."\r\n\r\n"I hope you get whatever you want, Harry."\r\n\r\nHe wanted to say it no longer was available. "A man doesn\'t know what\r\nhe wants, until he has it."\r\n\r\n"Well...."\r\n\r\n"Goodbye, Nancy."\r\n\r\n"Goodbye, Harry."\r\n\r\nThe door shut. He fled with his picture.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Come in, Allerton. Nice vacation?" Captain Greene peered at him\r\nthrough a blue haze of cigar smoke.\r\n\r\n"Not particularly. There are too many people. Too many complications.\r\nA man can\'t think straight out there, with all that confusion. I don\'t\r\nknow...."\r\n\r\n"I said you were for space. When you\'ve been around as long as I have,\r\nyou\'ll be able to smell \'em, too. You think I\'m kidding?

=== Chunk 11 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Probably not, sir."\r\n\r\n"There is security and security, Allerton. It can\'t be explained to a\r\nman. He\'s got to find out for himself. Alone in space, with the ship\r\nand a frontier vaster than all the frontiers before it in history,\r\na certain type of man can be secure. He\'s the man who\'s lost in a\r\ncrowd. Confused and muddled by convention, he\'s not a hero. Basically,\r\nhe\'s a lonesome man. Strangely, the psychologists tell you he\'s happy\r\nthen--when he\'s lonesome. You see what I mean, Allerton?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir. Not entirely."\r\n\r\n"Forget that formal stuff. Well, you\'ll learn. The important thing is\r\nthis: there aren\'t enough real spacemen to go around. A normal man\r\ndoesn\'t give up life for dedication. A spaceman does. You belong to a\r\nstrange breed, Allerton. Want to talk about your vacation?"\r\n\r\n"Absolutely not," Allerton said curtly, then apologized. The thought of\r\nit, the thought of stepping off the _Eros_ again and feeling the ground\r\nof Earth underfoot, wet ground sometimes, or dry and dusty, or covered\r\nwith a white mantle of snow, always unpredictable, was distasteful.\r\n\r\n"You\'re one of the breed now," the Captain repeated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"You may close the Allerton file," said the government psychologist to\r\nhis secretary.\r\n\r\n"It\'s finished?"\r\n\r\n"We paid his wife a visit yesterday. 

=== Chunk 12 ===
They\'re the hardest ones to deal\r\nwith. The man never knows, but the woman does. How can you convince a\r\nwoman her husband will be happiest away from her--how can you convince\r\nher when you\'re not even sure yourself?"\r\n\r\n"I feel sorry for Allerton. You can\'t help feeling sorry for him."\r\n\r\n"But psychological tests indicate he\'ll be happier this way. Besides--"\r\n\r\n"--besides," the secretary finished for him, "it\'s for the good of the\r\nnation. But never mind those psychological tests. Don\'t have to tell\r\n_me_ which came first, the chicken or the egg."\r\n\r\n"Have it your way. 

=== Chunk 13 ===
But Mrs. Allerton understood."\r\n\r\n"After we worked on her night and day for three years!"\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless, she understood. Allerton is a special breed, a spaceman.\r\nWell, isn\'t he?"\r\n\r\n"And Mrs. Allerton playing along with us like that, pretending she had\r\nre-married--"\r\n\r\n"It was the best way. She knew that."\r\n\r\n"We convinced her of that. But forget it, chief. 

=== Chunk 14 ===
I\'d rather not talk\r\nabout it. Still, Allerton wasn\'t a born spaceman, and you know it.\r\nThere\'s no such thing, except for extreme introverts, who aren\'t such\r\ngood workers, anyway."\r\n\r\n"We need spacemen. We need dedicated men who don\'t want to see their\r\nnative planet. Either we control space or our enemy does."\r\n\r\n"Then why don\'t you say it that way?"\r\n\r\n"Well, because--"\r\n\r\n"Because you\'re afraid to admit it even to yourself, that\'s why.\r\nSpacemen aren\'t born, chief. They are made. They are not particularly\r\nheroic or well-adjusted people. They are ordinary men with induced\r\ntraumas and they don\'t want to go near Earth again, and we call them\r\nspacemen."\r\n\r\n"It\'s for the security of the nation," said the government psychologist\r\nas he opened a new file....\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
