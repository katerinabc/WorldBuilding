]\r\n\r\n\r\nThey will be condemning Doctor Dixon\'s experiment, by now. He\'ll be\r\nblamed for what happened to me. The newspapers will yelp, "Young\r\nScientist Loses Mind As Result of Rash Experiment!"\r\n\r\nThey will be wrong. I didn\'t lose my mind. It would be much truer to\r\nsay that my mind lost _me_.\r\n\r\nLet me go back. I was Fred Ellis, thirty years old, instructor in\r\npsychology at Midwestern University. At least, that\'s who I thought I\r\nwas!\r\n\r\nDoctor Francis Dixon, head of our department, was a dark, keen,\r\nbrilliant man who was out of place in those poky classrooms. But he and\r\nJohn Burke, the assistant professor, carried on much private research.\r\n\r\nDixon\'s work was usually way over my head. His ideas were brilliant,\r\nif unconventional. Burke, a blond young giant with a strong faculty\r\nof imagination, understood him better than I did. I was the plodding,\r\npatient type of scientist, I\'m afraid.\r\n\r\nBut I intensely admired Dixon and listened with deep interest to his\r\ntheories and suggestions. One night, talking with Burke, he came out\r\nwith the most daring suggestion of all.\r\n\r\nBurke had made the trite remark that "mind is just a function of the\r\nphysical body, after all."\r\n\r\n"How do we know it is?" 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Dixon demanded. "All good little modern\r\npsychologists repeat that, but how do we know? It may be that mind and\r\nbody are wholly different individual entities."\r\n\r\nBurke gaped at him. "But that\'s going back to old-fashioned nonsense.\r\nHow could mind and body be different entities?"\r\n\r\n"Ever go deep-sea fishing?" Dixon asked him unexpectedly.\r\n\r\n"Fishing?" repeated Burke.\r\n\r\n"Down off Florida you catch big sharks and sea-bass that have remoras,\r\nor sucker-fish, a foot long solidly attached to their sides. The remora\r\nis part of the shark, yet they\'re different entities.\r\n\r\n"Termites have flagellates in their body who digest the wood the\r\ntermites eat. Leguminous plants live in mutually profitable partnership\r\nwith nitrogen-fixing bacteria, the plants fixing carbon and the\r\nbacteria nitrogen."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not a sophomore," Burke said a little resentfully. "You can\r\nmention symbiosis without defining it for me."\r\n\r\nDixon laughed.\r\n\r\n"All right, I\'m talking about symbiosis--the ability of two entirely\r\ndifferent species of creatures to live in closest conjunction, one\r\ninside or attached to the body of the other."\r\n\r\nHe lighted a cigarette and looked at us.\r\n\r\n"Suppose the mind and body also are two different species of living\r\ncreatures, two _utterly_ different species, living together in\r\nsymbiosis?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf course the idea seemed a little crazy to me at first, and so it did\r\nto Burke.\r\n\r\n"That\'s a wacky theory, Dixon. You can see and handle a remora, but who\r\never saw or handled an individual human mind?"\r\n\r\n"Who ever saw or handled a radar beam?" retorted Dixon. "But we know\r\nit\'s there. Maybe your mind falls into the same class. A living,\r\nindividual creature, not of ordinary matter but of non-material\r\nphotons."\r\n\r\nI became so interested I ventured a question. "If my mind and body are\r\ntwo different creatures, how come I don\'t know it?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you know it?" 

=== Chunk 4 ===
he said. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
"You _do_ know it, Ellis. How many times\r\nhas your reasoning mind urged you to do one thing, while the instincts\r\nof your body led you to do another? Mind and body are always at strife\r\nin all of us--it\'s been so in all human history."\r\n\r\nHe seemed to kindle to his own idea.\r\n\r\n"Why is it that of all animals, only homo sapiens had what we call a\r\nconscious mind? The explanations of the biologists are pretty hazy,\r\nfor they don\'t really know the answer. Suppose the answer is that the\r\n_human_ body is the only one in which the individual, living mind can\r\nlive in symbiosis?"\r\n\r\nBurke was still unimpressed. "That\'s just the old dualistic theory of\r\nDescartes, at bottom."\r\n\r\n"The old has a habit of becoming the very new, in science," retorted\r\nDixon. "Doctor Alexis Carrel was a pretty modern and famous scientist.\r\nAnd Carrel, speculating in one of his books on the riddle of mind,\r\nsuggested that a mind might be an immaterial being that somehow inserts\r\nitself from outside into the human brain and dwells there."\r\n\r\nI was deeply interested.\r\n\r\n"Is there any way you could prove or disprove the theory, doctor?" I\r\nasked.\r\n\r\nDixon shrugged. "How are you going to prove it? Forcing the living\r\nmind temporarily out of its comfortable symbiotic partnership in the\r\nbody might prove it. But how can you force out a thing of immaterial\r\nphotons? Nothing but electric force could do it...."\r\n\r\nThat moment, as it turned out, was the beginning of the stunning events\r\nthat followed.\r\n\r\nUntil then, Dixon had been merely hypothesizing. But now his dark face\r\nchanged, and he was silent in intense thought.\r\n\r\n"I believe," he said finally, "that it might be done, by amplifying the\r\nelectroshock treatment used on psychotic patients by Cerletti and Bini\r\nin nineteen thirty-nine. You remember their patients could remember\r\nnothing of elapsing time while under shock? Their minds must have been\r\nout of their bodies for a moment!\r\n\r\n"Suppose I increased the electroshock strength to force the mind out a\r\nlittle longer? The subject, when he came back to normal, might then\r\nremember his sensations as a disembodied mind."\r\n\r\nBurke slowly nodded. "Sounds possible. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
But you\'ll never find out.\r\nYou\'ve no one to test the idea on, and never will have."\r\n\r\nI don\'t know why it was that I didn\'t hesitate a moment in speaking up.\r\nI had not the slightest doubt.\r\n\r\n"You can use me as your subject, doctor," I said.\r\n\r\nI believe now it was my vain desire to emulate Dixon, my consciousness\r\nof my own lack of brilliance, that made me seize a chance to\r\ndistinguish myself in an epochal experiment.\r\n\r\n"You, Ellis?" Burke looked shocked.\r\n\r\nBut Dixon didn\'t. A little light leaped into his eyes as he looked at\r\nme.\r\n\r\nHe liked me, I think. But that liking meant not a straw when compared\r\nto the intensity with which he pursued any research.\r\n\r\n"You know, of course, that it would be dangerous?" he warned. "The\r\nobject would be to force your mind free of your body for all of a few\r\nminutes, then let it return so you can describe your sensations.\r\n\r\n"This body-mind partnership, if it really exists, must be about the\r\nclosest symbiosis in existence. Tampering with the partnership might\r\nhave disastrous results.

=== Chunk 7 ===
"\r\n\r\nDixon didn\'t mean to do it, I\'m sure. But just such solemn\r\ndiscouragement as that was exactly what would add to the eagerness of a\r\nyoung enthusiast like myself.\r\n\r\nThat very night, I wrote out a letter volunteering myself as subject in\r\nthe experiment and freely exonerating Dixon and Burke of any possible\r\nunpleasant consequences.\r\n\r\nTwo nights later, Dixon had his preparations made. I think he rushed\r\nthings lest I lose my nerve. But I was more keen on the thing than\r\never. Even if things _did_ go wrong, I saw my name in the books as a\r\nhaloed martyr of science.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe had set up a simple generator whose output could be graduated\r\nbetween 70 and 100 volts. I lay down on a table, and he and Burke\r\nattached two rubber pads faced with copper to my temples, as the\r\nelectrodes.\r\n\r\nDixon repeated his final instructions.\r\n\r\n"At the slightest crook of your finger we\'ll cut the current, Ellis. If\r\nyou feel any dangerous sensations, don\'t hesitate."\r\n\r\nHe called, then, "All right, Burke--the switches."\r\n\r\n"I feel more like an executioner than a scientist," Burke growled.\r\n\r\nThe generator was already humming. Dixon fed the current so weakly at\r\nfirst that I could feel only a tingle in my nerves.\r\n\r\n"It\'ll take more than that," I told him, grinning.\r\n\r\nHe jumped his rheostats a little. The tingling in my nerves and brain\r\nbecame much stronger.\r\n\r\nI felt an odd, dizzy sensation. It got more pronounced as Dixon let me\r\nhave the current in stronger and stronger jolts.\r\n\r\nThe whole laboratory seemed to dim around me, even Dixon\'s dark,\r\nwatchful face blurring to my eyes.\r\n\r\nFor a moment, I felt panic. After all, there _was_ something gruesome\r\nabout trying temporarily to dissociate my mind from my body!\r\n\r\nDixon\'s voice came through the blur.\r\n\r\n"All right, Ellis?" he asked.\r\n\r\nPride made me conquer my panic.\r\n\r\n"Go ahead," I murmured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "Go ahead," I murmured from the table, for pride had\r\nmade me conquer my terror.]\r\n\r\nAll consciousness of bodily sensation vanished in a whirling blur as\r\nthe jolts of current came faster and faster. I had a ghastly sensation\r\nof _freedom_.\r\n\r\nCan freedom be terrible? Freedom from your own body can--at least at\r\nfirst. That was what I was feeling.\r\n\r\nI seemed to float in a whirling, throbbing haze. Then my strange\r\nsensations cleared a little.\r\n\r\nI was still in the laboratory. But now I was floating several feet\r\nabove the table and the limp body of Fred Ellis!\r\n\r\nI couldn\'t see, or hear, or use any other ordinary bodily sense. Yet\r\nI _felt_ my surroundings as clearly as though I saw them, by means of\r\nunguessable senses in my immaterial being.\r\n\r\nI was still I, but somehow it was now a different "I." I felt connected\r\nto the limp form of Fred Ellis below me only by a tenuous thread.\r\n\r\nDazed, bewildered by the change, as I hovered there I sensed a sudden\r\nclear question from close by.\r\n\r\n"Has your host died, comrade?"\r\n\r\nI didn\'t hear that, and it wasn\'t in words. It was in thought or\r\nthought-force that I automatically received.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, I was conscious now of another immaterial being like\r\nmyself hovering close to me. He couldn\'t be seen, any more than I\r\ncould, but he was there. And he was completely free, not connected as\r\nI was to a lax human body.\r\n\r\n"Has your host died?" he asked again.\r\n\r\nDazedly, without realizing what I said, I answered in thought.\r\n\r\n"No, he is not dead. I am still linked to him.

=== Chunk 8 ===
"\r\n\r\n"_Have you been here long, comrade?_" came the question. "I am Klon,\r\nand I am newly-come from Aarl."\r\n\r\nAarl? That name was like a trigger in my hovering mind, unloosing a\r\nstrange dim flood of memory.\r\n\r\n"I am T\'Shal, and I came from Aarl ages ago," I exclaimed. "Only now do\r\nI remember! There is horror here--"\r\n\r\n_Crash!_\r\n\r\nIt all ended suddenly. I was Fred Ellis, dazedly opening my eyes on the\r\ntable. The thunderous crash had been merely the click of a switch.\r\n\r\n"Ellis?" Dixon was sweating as he chafed my wrists. "Ellis, are you all\r\nright?"\r\n\r\nI stared at him in a frozen fashion.\r\n\r\n"You brought me back into my body?"\r\n\r\n"And just in time, I\'d say!" exclaimed Burke. "You were in a ghastly\r\ncoma--I insisted we cut it short."\r\n\r\nDixon had seized eagerly on my words. "You mean, you were really out of\r\nyour body? Your mind was free for those moments?"\r\n\r\n"Only partly free," I mumbled. "I was still linked to it. But even so,\r\nI was just beginning to remember something--"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was fading in my mind, even as I tried to tell about it.\r\nFrantically, I sought to grasp those vague, vanishing memories.\r\n\r\n"Something about a place called Aarl! And I thought my name was T\'Shal,\r\nand--and I can\'t remember, now."\r\n\r\n"Ellis, try to remember!" Dixon urged. "Think hard, man!"\r\n\r\nThe harder I tried, the more swiftly receded those fast-fading\r\nmemories. It was all gone already from my brain.\r\n\r\nWe talked it over for hours that night, after I had recovered from my\r\nshakiness.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve stumbled onto experimental proof of the most revolutionary\r\ntheory in scientific history," Dixon said. "Proof that the mind is a\r\nwholly different species and entity from the human body, and is merely\r\na symbiotic partner of that body.\r\n\r\n"Good Heavens, think of all the things that it would explain! If you\r\ncould only remember more, Ellis! 

=== Chunk 9 ===
Think again--what was it about Aarl?"\r\n\r\nAarl? The name vibrated in my thoughts like something faint, far away,\r\nheartbreaking.\r\n\r\nDid you ever try to remember something and couldn\'t, yet the very thing\r\nyou couldn\'t remember made you feel sad? It was that way with me.\r\n\r\nI knew that Aarl meant something to me, something wonderful and\r\nterrifying. But I couldn\'t remember what it was.\r\n\r\n"There\'s a possible explanation of your quick forgetfulness," said\r\nDixon finally. "The mind-entity, once it is inhabiting the human brain,\r\nis so far overcome by the human animal\'s rudimentary nervous currents\r\nthat it is drugged, inhibited.\r\n\r\n"That would explain why young children, whose human brains are not yet\r\nfully developed, continually have strange, fanciful \'memories\' of other\r\nthings, of queer places that they call fairylands."\r\n\r\nBurke nodded thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n"You mean that in infancy the mind-partner of the symbiosis is not so\r\ninhibited and can still remember its own past? Maybe Wordsworth was\r\nright:\r\n\r\n    "\'Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting,\r\n    The soul that rises with us, our life\'s star,\r\n    Hath had elsewhere its setting,\r\n    And cometh from afar.\'"\r\n\r\n"Something like that," Dixon affirmed, pondering. "And when the mind\r\ngets almost free of the body-partner, as Ellis did, then it _can_\r\nremember."\r\n\r\nI told him, "If you had used a little stronger electroshock, if I\'d\r\nbeen free altogether, I know I could remember more."\r\n\r\nBurke looked doubtful.\r\n\r\n"What good would it do you, since you\'d forget it all again when you\r\ncame back into your body?"\r\n\r\nDixon quickly figured an answer.\r\n\r\n"If the free mind is a group of photons as we believe, it could\r\ninterrupt a sufficiently sensitive photoelectric beam and actuate a\r\nrelay to a telegraph-sounder. Ellis could signal us that way by the\r\nMorse code. He could tell us right at the moment what he remembers,\r\n_before_ he returns to his body and forgets."\r\n\r\n"If you\'ll fix up such a device, I\'ll try the thing again!" I promised.\r\n\r\nIt was crazy of me to make that offer, I felt. The dim unearthliness\r\nof my experience should have been enough for me.\r\n\r\nBut I was haunted by that most maddening of feelings, by a vain desire\r\nto remember something forgotten.\r\n\r\nSomehow, I felt that Aarl, where I had been T\'Shal, was so vastly\r\nimportant as to overrule any danger to my life as Fred Ellis. I had a\r\npremonition of beauty and wonder and horror all waiting to burst upon\r\nme--if I could only remember them!\r\n\r\nSo the next night, when I again took my place on the table, it was with\r\nincreased eagerness. Dixon had showed me the beam of photoelectric\r\nforce now crossing the room just above the table.\r\n\r\n"You said that as a mind you were aware of locations and could move,\r\nEllis. Well, if you can move into this beam, it will actuate the\r\ntelegraph-sounder and signal us.\r\n\r\n"Send us, if you\'re able, an exact description of just what you feel\r\nand remember. We\'ll take it down--and when you return to your body, it\r\nwon\'t matter if you immediately do forget everything again."\r\n\r\nHe turned on the electroshock current, and I felt again that sharp\r\ntingle in body and brain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAgain, my senses blurred. The laboratory swam about me, I was whirling\r\nthrough dimness.\r\n\r\nThe pressure of the jolting current mounted and mounted. I felt an\r\nintolerable sense of strain--then a sharp, sudden release.\r\n\r\nI was completely free of Fred Ellis\' limp body now! I, T\'Shal the\r\nAarlan, who had inhabited Ellis\' body for thirty Earth years!\r\n\r\n"Comrade, is it you again?" I recognized instantly the mental voice of\r\nKlon, who had said he was newly-come from Aarl.\r\n\r\nFrom Aarl? Memory began to rush over me, memory that was\r\nheartbreakingly vivid.\r\n\r\nI remembered Aarl! I remembered our world of supernal beauty and\r\nsplendor that lay far, far across the cosmos from this drab, heavy\r\nlittle world Earth.\r\n\r\nAarl, world not of solid matter but of free electrons, floating like\r\na glorious sphere of light in the glare of a great white sun! Aarl,\r\nwondrous globe of ever-shifting color, light and beauty!\r\n\r\nAnd I was an Aarlan! I was one of the race that had evolved there as\r\nindividual, intelligent photon-groups--immaterial photon-beings living\r\nimmortally in our radiant, ethereal world!\r\n\r\n"Comrade, I sense your trouble of spirit!" came the cry of Klon. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
"What\r\nis wrong?"\r\n\r\n"You have just come from Aarl, you say?" I cried. "You must go back\r\nthere, back to Aarl before you are trapped on this world!"\r\n\r\n"Are you mad, comrade?" he asked wonderingly. "Why should I leave when\r\nI have come to gather new experiences on this world?"\r\n\r\nTo gather new experiences? Yes, that was the passion of all us immortal\r\nAarlans. For ages, beating our way out through the cosmos on streams of\r\nlight, we had visited other worlds. We had entered the bodies of their\r\nmaterial creatures and had lived there with them in peaceful symbiosis,\r\ngarnering many rich new experiences.\r\n\r\nAnd that was why we had come to this planet Earth, long ago. How well\r\nI remembered now that I, T\'Shal, had been one of that very band of\r\nAarlans who first had visited this planet!\r\n\r\n"This world Earth must yield fascinating experiences," Klon was saying.\r\n"For no Aarlan who came here has ever yet returned."\r\n\r\n"You do not understand!" 

=== Chunk 11 ===
I cried. "When we came here first, we picked\r\na species of ape-creature as the most suitable symbiotic partners and\r\nentered their brains in the usual way. We intended only our customary\r\ntemporary stay.\r\n\r\n"But we were disastrously entrapped! This ape-species has no\r\ntrue intelligence, but they have instincts of surpassing nervous\r\nintensity--instincts of greed and lust and hatred. And that bestial\r\nnervous influence warped the symbiosis we intended, distorted our own\r\nintelligence, inhibited our thinking until we forgot all about Aarl!\r\n\r\n"Yes, we forgot Aarl, forgot our own identities and thought of\r\nourselves only as the minds of these ape-like creatures! And each of\r\nus, when his symbiotic partner died, remained so dazed and drugged that\r\nhe merely drifted on to another ape-host, another partner."\r\n\r\nKlon\'s horrified thought came. "But then why is it that you are able to\r\nremember now, T\'Shal?"\r\n\r\n"Because the shock of force that released me from my ape-host dissolved\r\nthe inhibiting effect and made full memory return to me!" I told him.\r\n\r\n"What are we to do?" cried Klon. "Always, we have supposed that\r\nsymbiosis with these Earth-creatures must be richly rapturous, since\r\nno Aarlan ever returned from here. Aarlans have come here in millions\r\nfor that reason, and more will come!"\r\n\r\n"No more must come!" I told him. "You and I will return at once to Aarl\r\nto warn all our race of the horrible trap of Earth. At least we will be\r\nable to prevent any more of our race from coming here."\r\n\r\nI added, "And before we leave, I will make an effort to save all the\r\nmillions of us who remain trapped here in the dazing symbiosis with the\r\nape-creatures. If I could make them all remember their true identity,\r\nthey might be able to break free of this bondage."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat is why I, T\'Shal of Aarl, am utilizing the photoelectric signaling\r\ndevice to send back this last message before I leave Earth forever.\r\n\r\nYou who are listening to my signals, Dixon and Burke! You others who\r\nwill read this account when it is published to the world as I beg them\r\nto do--all of you, heed my plea!\r\n\r\nYou are not Earthmen, as you think. Your brute bodies belong to Earth,\r\nbut that within you which is the real "you" has no connection with this\r\nplanet.\r\n\r\nYou are Aarlans, members of the greatest and most glorious race in the\r\ncosmos, immortal individuals trapped by chance in the bodies of brute\r\nbeasts here!\r\n\r\nTry to remember, you who read these words! Try to remember Aarl, our\r\nglorious world of ethereal radiance from which you yourself came long\r\nago.\r\n\r\nBreak free from this sordid symbiosis and come home! Come home from\r\nEarth! Come home across the cosmos to the undying beauty and wonder and\r\npeace of your own native world!\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
