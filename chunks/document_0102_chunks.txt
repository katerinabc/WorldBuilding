I warn you, your time is short.

"\r\n\r\nWalt Granger stomped over to the enclosure and swung a heavy boot\r\nagainst one of the two-by-fours that stood like a crooked row of\r\nsentries. "That\'s my worry," he grunted.\r\n\r\nHe had stumbled upon the whole business just two hours before, right in\r\nthe middle of his part of the geoglogic survey that was going on in the\r\nrock strewn hills and gullies known on the maps as the Millsport Range.\r\nHe had seen the ship the moment it left the ground, and a few yards\r\nfrom the burned circle of grass that was still smoldering from the\r\nrocket blast, there sat the fat little specimen of life from another\r\nworld. Granger had caught the thing by surprise and had a rope around\r\nits middle before it could scamper into the brush.\r\n\r\n"My comrades will return for me," warned the thing, its yellowish\r\neyes slowly and rhythmically protruding and withdrawing within their\r\nsockets. "They\'ll have no trouble finding you, and when they do...."\r\n\r\n"Shut up!" snapped Granger, pulling on his leather jacket. He turned\r\nto the cement fireplace and gave the embers a poke with a charred\r\nstick, looking around at the cage every few seconds as though he feared\r\nleaving his back turned for more than instant.\r\n\r\nHe looked at his watch. Eight o\'clock, and night was fast spreading a\r\nblanket of charcoal shadows over the hillsides. He\'d wait till morning\r\nto move this crazy beast to the next camp six miles away. A night trip\r\nmight entail chances he wasn\'t willing to take.\r\n\r\nAfter a couple of nervous fumbles with a match, he lit a cigarette\r\nand glanced uneasily out the one window in the rough cabin. What if\r\nthe alien, or whatever it was, wasn\'t kidding about the danger he was\r\nin? What if his buddies did decide to come back before morning with\r\nthe extermination of a human on their minds? Think of it, Granger, he\r\ntold himself laconically, you\'d be a hero! A nice, cold, dead one.

And\r\nthey\'d never find the bunch who\'d have knocked him off. He\'d be one of\r\nthose "mysterious deaths" the papers played up.\r\n\r\n"Free me immediately!" screeched the angry captive, his head swaying\r\nlike a balloon on a stick. "You haven\'t much time left!"\r\n\r\n"You\'re a nasty tempered little imp, aren\'t you?" growled Granger as he\r\nstrode across the room and peeked curiously inside the crate.\r\n\r\n"I loathe you," growled the thing. "I have no intentions of deceiving\r\nyou. This whole situation is simply a matter of pure logic so far as\r\nyour plight is concerned."\r\n\r\n"You\'re forgetting," said Granger, his voice lacking a certain amount\r\nof its previous confidence, "that you\'re the one who\'s in a mess."\r\n\r\n"Only temporarily, you fool!" raved the creature, jumping frantically\r\nup and down.

"Look!" he screamed, pointing a tiny hand toward the\r\nwindow over Granger\'s left shoulder.\r\n\r\nThe geologist gasped as he shot a quick glance in the direction of the\r\nthing\'s outstretched arm. A pale green light had turned the surrounding\r\nland and sky into an eerie dawn that extended its weird phosphorescence\r\ninto the cabin itself. And two hundred yards from the cabin, in a small\r\narea relatively clear of major obstructions, was the same ship he had\r\nseen a few hours before.\r\n\r\n"They\'re here!" shouted the alien. "Let me out!"\r\n\r\nGranger slammed shut the door and lifted a massive oak bar into iron\r\nbrackets on either side. Then he was at the window again. A hatch near\r\nthe bottom of the craft was open, but there was no sign of movement.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen he saw one of them, an exact duplicate of his captive, running\r\nfrom bush to bush about fifty feet from the ship. A few steps behind\r\nhim was another. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Two more nearby scrambled over an immense boulder and\r\nscurried into the brush. Another five were emerging, like a patrol of\r\nmidgets, from a ravine to the north of the cabin.\r\n\r\n"Be sensible, you idiot!" snarled the thing in the crate. "I\'m giving\r\nyou this final chance. Unlock this contrivance, and all will be well\r\nwith you. I\'ll speak on your behalf."\r\n\r\n"So you can lead your buddies right back here? Sure," said Granger,\r\n"that\'s all I\'d have to do to finish myself off in a real hurry."\r\n\r\n"Do as I say!" yelled the alien. "For your own sake!"\r\n\r\n"Look," panted Granger, "I know I was crazy to fool with you in the\r\nfirst place, but now that you\'re here and they\'re outside, you\'re\r\nstaying, see?"\r\n\r\nHe reached under the lumpy pile of cotton that served as a mattress\r\nand pulled out his .30-30 rifle. Little Boy Blue and his pop gun, he\r\nthought. He grabbed a handful of cartridges from a box under the bed\r\nand began jamming them into the magazine.\r\n\r\n"That will be of no use, my friend," droned a hollow voice behind him.\r\n\r\nGranger spun himself around just as a pane of glass in the window flew\r\nto pieces under the impact of a short, shiny gun barrel. A perfect\r\nreproduction of the face of the creature in the cage centered itself\r\nin the jagged frame of the broken window and gave him the shadow of a\r\nsmile that was closer to a victorious leer.\r\n\r\n"Put down your weapon," the newcomer ordered coldly.\r\n\r\nGet that rifle up fast, Granger commanded himself.\r\n\r\n"I repeat," said the face at the window. "Lower your weapon."\r\n\r\nThey\'ll let you have it anyway, Granger thought grimly. He slowly\r\ncurled his finger around the trigger and started to move when he was\r\njarred off his feet by a roaring blast that ripped the door from its\r\nhinges and sent it crashing against the rear wall of the cabin.\r\n\r\nOutside the ruined entrance stood a group of aliens all armed.\r\nFearfully, he looked to the window, but their leader was gone. In a\r\nsecond he appeared at the door, moved inside the cabin, and Granger\r\nautomatically stepped back, his hazy mind calculating roughly the few\r\nfeet of escape route remaining to him. In a moment he was there, his\r\nback flattened against the cabin wall.\r\n\r\nThe short creature kept coming on, its murky orbs fixed on Granger\'s\r\nwhite, drawn countenance. Then it stopped its advance.\r\n\r\n"So you have one of our people," it said in a voice that twanged like\r\npiano wire.\r\n\r\nGranger tried once in vain for his voice, then gave up. He stared over\r\nthe head of his foe at the silent assembly outside the cabin, then at\r\nthe thing in the packing crate. It was sitting there, quiet, immobile,\r\nbut intently watching the scene between the earthman and his visitor.\r\n\r\n"You are holding one of us captive," the commander remarked. "This is\r\na most unfortunate situation, indeed." The small figure stepped aside\r\nquickly and waved an arm.\r\n\r\nGranger, perspiration trickling down his face, watched a score of\r\nglistening weapons raised and pointed inside the cabin. For a second\r\nhe looked directly at the menacing horde. Then his eyes saw nothing. A\r\nblazing flash of white light burst forth from the doorway, and it was\r\nall over.\r\n\r\nGranger forced open his aching eyes and squinted in the direction of\r\nthe fiery blast, but the doorway was empty. The commander was still\r\nthere, though, walking slowly to the door.\r\n\r\nWhy am I alive? Granger asked himself incredulously. Or am I dead? He\r\nbumped his fist against his forehead once or twice and gave his head\r\na vigorous shake. Suddenly, he turned his gaze to the cage. But he saw\r\nnothing that resembled the rebuilt packing crate; only a mound of ashes\r\nand twisted spikes. In the center of the heap, like a fat, dwarfish\r\nking astride his fallen kingdom, was the charred, blackened shell of\r\nthe grotesque creature that had once occupied the wooden cell.\r\n\r\nThen he moved cautiously toward the door and stared, speechless, at the\r\nleader of the expedition.\r\n\r\n"We shall depart now," said the being. "Thank you for helping us."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNot much later, across the silent reaches of space, a communications\r\noperator on another planet looked up from his receiving equipment and\r\nhanded his superior a message just transmitted from a ship leaving the\r\nplanet Earth: RETURN MISSION SUCCESSFUL. DESERTER LOCATED AND EXECUTED.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
