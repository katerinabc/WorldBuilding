It would\r\nsoon have him.\r\n\r\nThe wind was trying to finish him off right now. It shrieked, moaned,\r\nwhispered and shouted through the smashed hull where he sprawled in his\r\nspace-suit. Laughed, too. The wind was a murderer--and was glad.\r\n\r\nAll but he were dead. Soon the grit-laden wind would bury them and\r\ntheir ship. Then all the effort, the skill, the faith--all the\r\ningenuity and labor expended on the expedition--would be wiped away, as\r\ninvisible as the wind that buried them.\r\n\r\nThinking of that, thinking back over each agonizing hour since his\r\nlanding on Venus, George Main wondered what he should have done, what\r\nhe could now do, to prevent the utter waste of their efforts and their\r\nlives.\r\n\r\nThe wind was his enemy--and the wind couldn't even be seen. Only the\r\ndust it carried was visible. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Too visible. Dust was so thick in the\r\nupper atmosphere that the scope-readers had mistaken dust-clouds for\r\nsolid ground.\r\n\r\nWith ports blinded by dust, the possibility of that error had been\r\nobvious enough. The navigator knew the risk. He chanced it--and lost\r\nthe toss.\r\n\r\nGeorge knew he was still alive only because he'd acted like a childish\r\neager-beaver. And had been tolerated by the others because he was the\r\ncrew's youngest member.\r\n\r\nEver since he could read and dream, he'd wanted to be the first man\r\never to touch the soil of Venus. So, having no duties connected\r\nwith setting down the ship, he'd gotten into his space-suit and had\r\nwaited by a hatch. He was standing there when the ship went into the\r\ntwenty-mile free fall that smashed it.\r\n\r\nGeorge didn't know who opened the escape hatch and shoved him out. That\r\nman was dead, along with the rest of the crew. Unlike George's suit,\r\nthe space-ship had no parachute.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe'd landed blind, in dust so thick he didn't know he was down till he\r\ngot there. For forty-eight hours he'd lain where he fell, waiting for a\r\nlull in the storm so he could see the ship.\r\n\r\nWhen the wind finally quit, the ship was already half buried. Thirsty,\r\nhungry, stinking in the hot suit, George had staggered over windrow\r\nafter windrow of dust to reach it.\r\n\r\nHe'd broken out an emergency-jug of water, found some uncontaminated\r\nfood, erected within the hull a small gas-proof tent, and then passed\r\nout before he could crawl in the tent to eat and drink.\r\n\r\nLater he'd gone out while the lull continued, to search for bodies.\r\nLike the hull itself, they were scattered over a wide area. Some were\r\nalready buried in dust. The wind had buried them.\r\n\r\nThe wind--the murdering wind. The wind of formaldehyde that poisoned\r\nevery drop of water it touched, every bit of food. The wind that\r\nlimited George's supplies to unbroken containers--of which there were\r\ntragically few.\r\n\r\nThe wind mocked him, then and thereafter. It mocked his efforts to find\r\nthe ship's log and continue it. It mocked his efforts to live.\r\n\r\nHe tried to fight back. He lay prone and relaxed because that took less\r\noxygen. He lay in the suit and not in the tent because that took less\r\noxygen. He ate and drank but once a day because that took less oxygen.\r\n\r\nSo he had run out of water while there were still some potassium oxides\r\nleft to refresh his thrice-breathed air, some oxygen for the tent.\r\n\r\nGeorge Main wanted to live, knew he would die. And was enraged at the\r\nthought that he would die without having accomplished anything. He and\r\nhis friends, and the pioneering scientists back of them, had put too\r\nmuch effort into trans-System travel to have it all come to nothing\r\nlike this.\r\n\r\nStubbornly he noted in the log that he was now dehydrated to the point\r\nof occasional delirium. And that he hated the wind.\r\n\r\nAs if that wind had not already done enough, it now sought to destroy\r\nhis last remaining moments of sanity. It brought a horde of odd shapes\r\nto haunt him.\r\n\r\nThe shapes literally rolled into the dust-filled metal cavity where he\r\nlay writing. The wind rolled them. But when they got into shelter--had\r\nrolled to one side or the other of the holes through which they'd\r\ncome--the shapes began to move, slowly, under their own power.\r\n\r\nThey all looked alike. There were a couple of dozen, maybe--George\r\ncounted ten and gave up because counting was too much like work. They\r\nwere teardrops--eight-inch yellow teardrops with the point down.\r\nAnd each point rested on an extensible foot that looked like a blue\r\nstarfish, about four inches across its seven points.\r\n\r\nThey came in, rolling along the ground as the wind took them, and then\r\nextended their stars from some hidden place and moved on them when out\r\nof the wind.\r\n\r\nThat is, they seemed to. But whether they were in the hull or in his\r\nmind, George was by no means sure.\r\n\r\nNothing could live in this wind. Nothing could live on a planet with\r\nno water, where the air was full of formaldehyde ready to react with\r\nproteins, the basis of life.\r\n\r\nHe lay motionless, watching idly. There was no sound but the wind. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
The\r\nyellow teardrops scattered out. They could have been exploring--or\r\nseeking shelter--or nonexistent.\r\n\r\nWhen he got tired of watching them, George put the log aside and slept.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe awoke to find a small congregation of teardrops surrounding the\r\nwatch strapped outside the suit on his left wrist. The watch was\r\ngoing--wound through habit every twenty-four hours, though that was but\r\na third of a day, here on Venus. The teardrops were curious about it.\r\n\r\nHow he got the idea they were curious, George didn't quite know. They\r\nseemed attracted to it, was all. There were no eyes, so far as he\r\ncould tell--no ears. If these things had senses, they were not like\r\nterrestrial senses. But the teardrops did have an attitude of attention.\r\n\r\nGeorge removed his watch, laid it before them. Two teardrops detached\r\nthemselves from the group to examine his right hand, with which he'd\r\nslipped off the wrist-band. Three others perched on the dust-covered\r\ndeck, the watch between them and him.\r\n\r\nGeorge flexed his right hand, twiddled his fingers. The teardrops\r\nseemed unafraid. He chose one and lifted it. It seemed light in weight.\r\nIts star-foot was slightly prehensile, and grasped his glove with tiny\r\nclaws arranged in rows on its bottom surface.\r\n\r\nThe claws seemed for clinging, not for seizing. George put down the\r\nteardrop, turned it over, and found no opening anywhere on the surface.\r\nIf these things lived, he decided, they must be plants, synthesizing\r\ntheir food--they had no way to eat as animals do.\r\n\r\nVaguely, George made up his wavering mind that the things existed\r\noutside his imagination. They were alive. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
They felt curiosity about\r\nhim. Leathery, he found them--hard and smooth, except for the foot.\r\n\r\nWhen he set down the teardrop he'd been examining, the three by his\r\nwatch took up a rhythmic motion. The center one stood in place,\r\nswaying slowly above the watch like a bit of seaweed in a quiet lagoon.\r\n\r\nEach of the other two had somehow obtained a pebble. They set their\r\npebbles down near the watch. Each then tapped with a star-point, first\r\nat the pebble, then at the watch. Back and forth they swayed, their\r\nmotions synchronized--perhaps directed by the center one.\r\n\r\nInteresting--but meaningless. It was equally meaningless when the two\r\nteardrops at his right began to dance. They found an empty food-can\r\nlid, pushed it near his hand, and began a concerted swaying and\r\npointing that took them between hand and can.\r\n\r\nIdly, George led the dance with a waggled forefinger. The teardrops\r\npromptly changed their motion. They stood in place, no longer pointing\r\nalternately at lid and finger, but swaying between them in time with\r\nGeorge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Idly, George led the dance with a waggled\r\nforefinger...._]\r\n\r\nThey were slow, though--he could easily have left them behind. But if\r\nhe moved his finger slowly enough, they kept perfect time.\r\n\r\nThe dance at the watch had stopped. Many teardrops gathered around the\r\npair that followed the beat of his right index finger.\r\n\r\nIt must have amused them. But it soon tired George. He stopped.\r\n\r\nHe needed all his remaining energy to think with. He knew these\r\nteardrops were sentient. They were curious, they communicated with each\r\nother, and they danced. They had minds, therefore.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGeorge remembered hearing that Man had danced even before he learned\r\nto speak, in a primitive effort to express his feelings. He knew some\r\nbirds dance, too--as a courtship procedure. Insects, even.\r\n\r\nBut why did the teardrops dance?\r\n\r\nWhat was the significance of rhythmic motion between a pebble and a\r\nwatch? A tin lid and a man's hand? What did the pebbles mean?\r\n\r\nThe pebble was a native object, known to be lifeless, inanimate. The\r\nwatch was a strange something that moved. The can-lid did not move.\r\nThe hand--gloved, though they could not know that--was an object that\r\nmoved.\r\n\r\nThe dance was a question, therefore. Alive, or dead? The teardrops\r\nwanted to know. Is the watch that moves by itself alive? The strangely\r\nsymmetrical lid of a can, is it alive? The oddshaped hand?\r\n\r\nThese teardrops had good minds--could grasp abstractions. In a sense,\r\nGeorge felt, the difference between animate and inanimate objects is an\r\nabstraction. In his dying state, the notion amused him.\r\n\r\nSmiling, he placed a pebble on the watch, another on the lid. He sat\r\nup, moved his weakened body so they could perhaps tell it was a unit.\r\nHe picked up a teardrop in each hand, held them at his visor, rolled\r\nhis eyes, and opened and shut his mouth. He spoke to them. He sang to\r\nthem. He swayed with them to show he too could dance.\r\n\r\nThey made no sign of reply. None that he could recognize, at any rate.\r\n\r\nCarefully he felt and looked at the entire surface of a teardrop,\r\nputting one down to devote both hands to the other. He thought perhaps\r\nthe lack of organs and openings might simply mean they were clothed or\r\narmored in some way. But the thing was apparently naked. The surfaces\r\nhe touched were probably skin. He didn't know.\r\n\r\nAnd they, would they know what a man was? Were they even certain he was\r\nalive?\r\n\r\nOne of them was behind him, dancing before the tent. Seeing that, he\r\nwas certain the teardrops hadn't yet distinguished the animate from the\r\ninanimate in the objects around them here.\r\n\r\nAnd George had little time to teach them. Already he was dull and\r\nlistless. His vision was playing tricks on him.\r\n\r\nLike as not he'd be dead before they knew for certain he'd been alive.\r\nDead in the grotesque space-suit. Preserved in an atmosphere of\r\nformaldehyde. His body would seem like a machine that had run down.\r\nThere would be no discernable difference between himself and his watch.\r\n\r\nBut if they knew he'd been alive? They might remember, then. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
They were\r\nintelligent, could communicate with one another. By rights they should\r\nhave some kind of legends or traditions or history. If they did, if\r\nthey knew they'd seen alien life, they'd keep the memory alive.\r\n\r\nThey'd recognize the next man to land on Venus, might find means\r\nto tell of this first expedition. Might lead a man to the buried\r\nspace-ship, the bodies, the ship's log.\r\n\r\nAt least they could defeat the wind. The teardrops could keep his life\r\nand the lives of his mates from going utterly to waste. Whether men\r\never found out or not, the teardrops themselves would know that the\r\nexpedition had reached Venus.\r\n\r\nBut first, George had to prove he was alive, like them--not some\r\nstrangely mobile meteorite, nor oddly contrived machine.\r\n\r\nHis very lack of strength, his real nearness to death, provided George\r\nwith the means he sought. Already he was half anesthetized by weakness\r\nand shock. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
He didn't have to worry about pain.\r\n\r\nHolding his breath, he took off his helmet. He picked up a teardrop\r\nwith each hand, held them to his hot cheeks. Then he let himself\r\nbreathe.\r\n\r\nHe knew the physical changes to follow would be obvious to the\r\nintelligent little dancers he held in his hands. He hoped they wouldn't\r\nget hurt, when they fell.\r\n\r\nHurt or not, they'd soon figure out he'd been alive--once he was\r\ndead....\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
