The answer was to discover a--\r\n\r\n                          HERO FROM YESTERDAY\r\n\r\n                           By Robert Randall\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Imagination Stories of Science and Fantasy\r\n                             December 1957\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day Lugert\'s criminals gunned down three citizens in a bold\r\nbroad-daylight robbery, Domnas Karson, Third Speaker of the Council,\r\nsaid, "I think I\'ve got the answer."\r\n\r\n"Answer? To what?" asked Murgon Darell Fourth Speaker.\r\n\r\n"To Lugert," said Karson. "The weapon we can use against that throwback\r\nwho\'s terrorizing us all."\r\n\r\nDarell sighed wearily. "There _is_ no answer to Lugert, I\'m afraid.\r\nWe\'re peaceful people; he\'s a throwback to a more violent age. There\'s\r\nno way to cope with him. Would you want to be the one to shoot him\r\ndown?"\r\n\r\nKarson shuddered and said, "No, not me. Of course not. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
I\'m no more\r\ncapable of violence than anyone else. But Lugert can be stopped. We can\r\nget help.

=== Chunk 3 ===
"\r\n\r\n"From where?"\r\n\r\n"From the past," said Karson. "From the ugly crime-ridden world we\'ve\r\nevolved out of. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Dr. Lorence of the Science Council has developed a\r\ntime-net which...."\r\n\r\n"Of course!" Darell exclaimed. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
"Bring a man out of the past! A man who\r\nwon\'t be inhibited by our innate hatred of violence, a man who\'ll be\r\nable to deal with Lugert as he deserves!" He rose and strode around\r\nthe long councilroom in quick, nervous steps. "Call Lorence, Karson.\r\nGet him at work on the project at once. We can\'t waste any more time.\r\nThere\'s no telling when Lugert might...."\r\n\r\nThe visiphone chimed three times. Karson crossed the room and depressed\r\nthe receiving stud. On the screen the features of a thick-faced, stocky\r\nman appeared.\r\n\r\n"Lugert! What do you want?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m pleased you recognize me so quickly, Speaker Karson," said the\r\nstocky man in a slow, deep voice. "My fame must be spreading, then."\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t call to chat with us, Lugert. What is it you want?"\r\n\r\nLugert\'s face hardened slowly.\r\n\r\n"You\'re right. I didn\'t call to chat. I called to tell you to get out."\r\n\r\n"What\'s that?"\r\n\r\n"I said, get out. Pack up your records and papers and clear out of the\r\nGovernment Building, Karson. You and all the rest of you. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
I\'m taking\r\nover."\r\n\r\nKarson paled. "Taking over--_the government_? How far do you think you\r\ncan go, Lugert?"\r\n\r\nAgain the confident, cheerful, steel-hard grin that had become the\r\nLugert trademark in such an astonishingly brief time. "How far? Why,\r\nKarson, I can go as far as I like. There isn\'t one of you who dares\r\nsay _No_ to anything I ask. And now I\'m asking for the government. Go\r\nahead; refuse. Get indignant. Threaten me. All this easy winning bores\r\nme, Karson."\r\n\r\nKarson stared at the thick-featured face framed by the visiscreen.\r\n"You\'ve won again," he said after a pause. "We can\'t fight you, Lugert.\r\nHow much time do we have to evacuate the Government Building?"\r\n\r\n"How much do you need?"\r\n\r\nKarson thought for a moment. "A week, at least. Is that all right?"\r\n\r\n"One week, no more," Lugert agreed. "My men and I will come up to take\r\nover things at noon on 7 September." He chuckled. "7 September, 2531. A\r\nday to go down in history, eh, Karson?"\r\n\r\nHe broke the contact.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKarson turned from the dead screen and looked at Speaker Darell. "Well,\r\nthere\'s our ultimatum," he said. "One week to get out and then Lugert\r\ntakes over."\r\n\r\n"That means we\'ll have to move fast," said Darell. "You\'d better call\r\nDr. Lorence. Only a week...."\r\n\r\nKarson was already busy punching out Lorence\'s code number on the\r\nvisiphone. When the scientist appeared Karson quickly sketched out\r\nthe situation as it stood. Lorence\'s eyes widened when Karson told of\r\nLugert\'s threat. Then the Speaker went on to outline the part Lorence\r\nand his time-net would play in the attempt to defeat Lugert.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll see what I can do," Lorence promised. "I\'ll try to find the man\r\nyou\'re looking for."\r\n\r\n"Can you do it in two days or less?"\r\n\r\n"I hope so," Lorence said.\r\n\r\nIt took two days. Then Lorence rang the Office of the Council and told\r\nKarson, "It\'s worked!"\r\n\r\n"The time-net? You\'ve got the man?"\r\n\r\n"I have. I\'ll bring him right over."\r\n\r\nLorence entered the council room a while later, followed by a tall,\r\nthin, lean-faced man dressed in archaic clothing. Karson\'s heart\r\nthumped excitedly; here was the man, he thought! Here was the hero from\r\nyesteryear who would put an end to the threat Lugert represented.\r\n\r\n"This is Speaker Karson and Speaker Darell of our governing Council,"\r\nLorence said.\r\n\r\nThe man from the past nodded curtly. "You can call me Jack." His voice\r\nwas cold, flat, with a curious twang of regional accent in it; the\r\nvowel-pronunciation was odd, as was to be expected.\r\n\r\nKarson eyed the hard-faced stranger. He didn\'t seem to have an ounce of\r\nfat on him; he looked tough, uncompromising. "I think you\'ll do," he\r\nsaid after a moment\'s study. "You\'ve got the stuff."\r\n\r\n"Thanks," Jack said in a wry voice. "Suppose you line the program out\r\nfor me now. Give me the picture; tell me what I\'m here for."\r\n\r\nKarson frowned. "You\'re here to help us, because we\'re helpless\r\nourselves. Did Dr. Lorence tell you what the characteristics of this\r\nworld are?"\r\n\r\n"He said a few things. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
You fill me in."\r\n\r\n"It\'s 300 years since we last had a war of any sort. Crime had been\r\nextinct 150 years--until Lugert.\r\n\r\n"Lugert. I heard of him. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
Who is he?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s the man you\'re going to kill for us," Karson said bluntly.\r\n\r\nThe man named Jack grinned. "Oh? A rub-out job?"\r\n\r\n"I think that\'s the term," said Karson. "Lugert\'s a throwback--a man\r\nout of the past. A man out of your time, suddenly reborn in our era\r\nfor God knows what reason. He\'s cold and hard and utterly ruthless.\r\nNothing stops him; we\'re powerless. The compulsion against violence is\r\ntoo strong in us."\r\n\r\n"Just a bunch of patsies," Jack said. "Lugert snaps the whip and you\r\nall lie down and play dead when he says so. That it?"\r\n\r\nIt took Karson a few moments to digest the strange idioms. Finally he\r\nsaid, "Right. He began small, with petty thefts and burglaries--he\r\ntook anything he wanted. Then he began branching out. He compelled a\r\nscientist to create a serum for him that would instill absolute loyalty\r\nto him in anyone who took it; using that serum, he\'s built up a band of\r\nhenchmen who shares his violent ways. Two days ago he decided to make\r\nthe ultimate grab for power: he ordered us to evacuate the Government\r\nBuilding and let him take over."\r\n\r\n"And you said yes," Jack remarked.\r\n\r\n"What else could we do? But we have a weapon: you. You share Lugert\'s\r\nway of life; we don\'t. We can strike at him indirectly, through you."\r\n\r\n"You want me to kill this Lugert. What\'s in it for me?"\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"I said, what\'s in it for me? What do I get out of it besides the risk\r\nof a punctured hide? I don\'t do these things for my health, Karson."\r\n\r\nKarson thought about that for a moment. "Of course; there would have\r\nto be some reward, wouldn\'t there? Well, what would you want? We can\r\nsupply virtually anything, if you\'ll do the job properly. Osmiridium?\r\nSapphires? Books? 

=== Chunk 9 ===
Women?"\r\n\r\nThe man named Jack shook his head. "Gold," he said.\r\n\r\nKarson was startled. "Gold? But why would you want--oh, very well.\r\nGold was the reigning object of value in your day, wasn\'t it? Would 25\r\npounds be enough?"\r\n\r\nThe man from the past smiled unwarmly. "Quite enough," he said. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
"You\r\ngot yourself a deal."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe man named Jack cautiously approached the big building that served\r\nas headquarters for Lugert until the time when he would move into the\r\nsprawling area of the Government Building.\r\n\r\nJack wore modern clothes; his own shabby ancient ones were carefully\r\nstored away in a laboratory closet. His hair was close-cropped in the\r\ncurrent fashion.\r\n\r\nBut inside his skull was the mind of a 20th-century man. And hidden in\r\nthe folds of his vest was a 20th-century automatic, a snubnosed .38\r\nready to spit death.\r\n\r\nThe day was 5 September 2531; he had been in this strange world of the\r\nfuture three days and if all went well he would return to his own time\r\ntoday. He had spent the three days studying the approach to Lugert\'s\r\nheadquarters, familiarizing himself with the layout, readying himself\r\nfor the killing that had to be done.\r\n\r\nHe was thinking, _Funny old duck, that Karson. They all are. Imagine,\r\nletting someone like Lugert push them all over the place because all\r\nthe fight\'s been bred out of them!_\r\n\r\nWell, in 600 years a lot could happen. He shrugged. It wasn\'t his\r\nbusiness to worry about the doings of his remote descendants.\r\n\r\nHis business was to kill.\r\n\r\nHe knew that Lugert\'s personal suite was on the eighth floor of the\r\nbuilding, that he was guarded by one man outside the door, one at the\r\nelevator entrance, and several in the lobby. He didn\'t have to worry\r\nabout the ones in the lobby. He didn\'t really have to worry about any\r\nof them on the way in: they wouldn\'t be expecting anyone dangerous. The\r\nonly dangerous people in this world were Lugert and his henchmen and\r\nthey\'d probably be off-guard when he came by.\r\n\r\nHis forearm itched where Lorence had inserted the sliver of metal. The\r\nold scientist had been very apologetic.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry, Jack, but we have to do this. We can\'t risk having another\r\nLugert. This is to make sure you don\'t get delusions of power once\r\nyou\'ve finished off Lugert."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"I mean we can control you hypnotically through this generator I\'m\r\nembedding in your arm. Just in case you decide not to go back to your\r\nown time when you\'re through here."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t worry. I wouldn\'t want to run this place."\r\n\r\nBut he couldn\'t blame them for being cautious. Not at all. They\'d be\r\neven more helpless before him than they would be under Lugert, after\r\nall.\r\n\r\nHe drew near the big building. The guard in front said, "Who are you,\r\nand where are you going?"\r\n\r\nJack made his voice as subservient-sounding as he could. He said, "I\'m\r\nfrom Speaker Karson. I\'d like to see Lugert."\r\n\r\nThe guard frowned. "How come Karson didn\'t just phone the boss?"\r\n\r\n"Beats me," Jack said. "Must be top-secret."\r\n\r\nThe guard frowned at Jack\'s strange language, shrugged, and sent him on\r\nin. He passed rapidly through the lobby and reached the elevator.\r\n\r\nA guard inside the elevator wanted to know where he was going. "I\'m\r\nfrom Speaker Karson," he said. "I have an urgent message to deliver to\r\nLugert."\r\n\r\nThe guard held out his hand. "Let\'s have it. I\'ll take it up to him;\r\nthe boss doesn\'t like to meet strangers."\r\n\r\nSmiling coldly, Jack fumbled in his pocket and withdrew the .38. It\r\nfired once; the silencer muffled the sound down to a squirt! A neat\r\nhole appeared in the elevator operator\'s head.\r\n\r\nStill smiling, Jack pressed _Eight_ and waited for the door to close.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThree minutes and two killings later he stood outside the office of\r\nLugert himself. The elevator was clear, now, and the floor was empty of\r\nhenchmen. That would make the getaway easier, Jack thought.\r\n\r\nHe knocked.\r\n\r\n"Who\'s there?" a voice growled.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Lugert?"\r\n\r\n"Yeah. Who\'s there and what do you want?"\r\n\r\n"Urgent message from Speaker Karson, sir. Very important that I see\r\nyou, Mr. Lugert."\r\n\r\nAfter a considerable pause the door swung open. Lugert stood there,\r\nwearing a glittering plastic robe. He hadn\'t shaved; he was short and\r\nsquat and fierce-looking. Jack smiled and drew the gun.\r\n\r\n"Please step inside and keep your hands in the air," he said quietly.\r\n"And don\'t make a fuss. This gun happens to kill people when it goes\r\noff."\r\n\r\nLugert stepped back. Jack noticed the man didn\'t seem frightened and\r\nwondered whether it was because Lugert just didn\'t believe another man\r\ncould possibly offer danger or because Lugert was without fear.\r\n\r\nHe said, "I\'ve killed three of your henchmen. I\'m figuring on killing\r\nyou, now. Speaker Karson is paying me to do it, Lugert."\r\n\r\nQuietly Lugert said, "Who are you? Where\'d you come from?"\r\n\r\n"You can call me Jack. You don\'t know me."\r\n\r\n"I can see there\'s a toughness about you," Lugert said. "You\'re like\r\nme. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
I didn\'t think there were any others like me in the world. Where\r\ndid Karson find you?"\r\n\r\n"In the past, Lugert. In yesterday. He dredged me up from the\r\n20th-Century. There were lots like you and me then, Lugert."\r\n\r\nFor the first time fear showed in Lugert\'s face. A driblet of\r\nperspiration snaked down the side of his fleshy jaw. Paler than he had\r\nbeen before, he said, "From the past? Then--then you can really kill\r\nme?"\r\n\r\nJack nodded. 

=== Chunk 12 ===
"I\'m going to. Karson\'s paying me 25 pounds of gold for\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"_Gold?_ But that stuff\'s worthless! You can find it anywhere. What do\r\nyou want gold for?"\r\n\r\n"In my time," said Jack, "the stuff wasn\'t so common. It was worth\r\nplenty. 

=== Chunk 13 ===
Times change."\r\n\r\nA crafty glint showed in Lugert\'s eyes. "You\'re just a hired killer,\r\nthen. A man without conscience. Suppose I offer you 30 pounds of gold\r\nnot to kill me. Fifty pounds? 

=== Chunk 14 ===
A hundred?"\r\n\r\nThe generator in Jack\'s arm twitched warningly. He knew Karson and\r\nLorence were listening in. 

=== Chunk 15 ===
"No," he said. "There\'s no percentage in it.\r\nYou don\'t have the time-net. You can\'t send me back to my own time.\r\nI\'ll stick with their offer."\r\n\r\n"No! Look, we can be partners! You\'re the kind of man I can get to\r\nlike, Jack. We\'ll work together, you and me. Fifty-fifty! An even\r\nsplit!"\r\n\r\nAgain the generator twitched. Jack sighed. "Sorry, Lugert. Can\'t do it.\r\nI made an agreement and I\'m going to stick to it. I\'m going to kill\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nSweat streamed down Lugert\'s face. "It\'s not fair," he said. "I had\r\nthis world under my thumb--and then they had to find you somewhere!\r\nWhy? Why\'d they have to mess everything up?"\r\n\r\n"Sorry, Lugert. It\'s just a lousy break for you," Jack said\r\nemotionlessly. "This is the way it\'s gonna be."\r\n\r\n"No!" Lugert yelled.\r\n\r\nJack raised the .38. Lugert threw up his hands as if to protect himself\r\nbut Jack\'s finger tightened anyway. The gun went squirt!\r\n\r\nLugert toppled heavily to the floor. He lay there on the heavy-pile\r\nrug, his blood spilling out and staining the brown carpet a deep red.\r\n\r\nJack looked at him calmly. Then he turned and left the room.\r\n\r\nThe floor was still empty. Quietly he got into the untended elevator,\r\nrode it to the lobby, and stepped out into the street. The whole job\r\nhad taken 10 minutes. Ten minutes and four killings, and he hadn\'t even\r\nraised a sweat.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDarell and Karson and Dr. Lorence were waiting for him in the\r\ncouncilroom of the Government Building when he got back.\r\n\r\n"Great work," Karson said. He looked pale and shaken. "We watched the\r\nwhole thing over the transmitter Lorence built into you. Every step.\r\nIt--it was well done."\r\n\r\n"Thanks," Jack said. "Is the gold ready?"\r\n\r\nLorence handed him a heavy satchel. "It\'s here. Twenty-five pounds.\r\nPlus five pounds extra for your cooperation."\r\n\r\n"Thanks again," Jack said. 

=== Chunk 16 ===
"Glad to be of help." He didn\'t mention\r\nthe moments when he wavered, when he had nearly gone over to Lugert\'s\r\nside--probably would have if it hadn\'t been for the generator planted\r\nin his arm.\r\n\r\nHe wondered briefly how it would have been, living here with all these\r\nquiet philosophical types.\r\n\r\nHe said, "I suppose you\'re going to send me back to my own time now."\r\n\r\nLorence nodded.\r\n\r\nThe four of them went to Lorence\'s office and Jack climbed back into\r\nthe elaborate harness.\r\n\r\nLorence bustled around him, making adjustments carefully. "We want to\r\ngauge this thing to the minute, you know," he explained. "No mistakes."\r\n\r\n"I appreciate the care," Jack said. He held tightly to his satchel.\r\n\r\n"We owe you a tremendous debt of gratitude," Karson said. "A debt that\r\nno satchel of gold could ever repay. You\'ve done us a great service.\r\nYou\'re a hero, Jack. A savior of humanity. We\'d never have beaten\r\nLugert without you."\r\n\r\n"Ready to go," Lorence said. He threw the switch.\r\n\r\nTime began to swirl around the killer from the past. As 2531 started\r\nto fade away from him he grinned for the last time and said, "Imagine\r\nthat. Me, a hero! I like that, Me, John Dillinger--a savior of\r\nhumanity!"\r\n\r\nAnd then he was gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
