=== Chunk 2 ===
He had seen it in her eyes and in the eyes of others.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Rush smoothed the covers over his wife, tucking them in where her\r\nrestless moving had pulled them away from the mattress. The twins moved\r\nbeside him, their smooth hands following his in the task, their blind\r\neyes intent on nothingness.\r\n\r\n"Thank you," he said softly to them, knowing they could not hear him.\r\nBut it made him feel better to talk.\r\n\r\nHis wife, Mary, was quiet. Her breathing was smooth, easy--almost as if\r\nshe were sleeping.\r\n\r\n_The long sleep._\r\n\r\nHe touched her forehead, but it was cool. The doctor had said it was a\r\nmiracle she had lived this long. He stood away from the bed for a moment\r\nwatching before he went on out to the porch. The twins moved back into\r\nwhat had become a normal position for them in the past months: One on\r\neach side of the bed, their thin hands holding Mary\'s tightly, the milky\r\nblind eyes surveying something that could not be seen by his eyes.\r\nSometimes they would stand like this for hours.\r\n\r\nOutside the evening was cool, the light not quite gone. He sat in the\r\nrocking chair and waited for the doctor who had promised to come--and\r\nyet might not come. The bitterness came back, the self-hate. He\r\nremembered a young man and promises made, but not kept; a girl who had\r\nbelieved and never lost faith even when he had retreated back to the\r\nland away from everything. Long sullen silences, self-pity, brooding\r\nover the news stories that got worse and worse. And the children--one\r\nborn dead--two born deaf and dumb and blind.\r\n\r\n_Worse than dead._\r\n\r\nYou helped, he accused himself. You worked for those who set off the\r\nbombs and tested and tested while the cycle went up and up beyond human\r\ntolerance--not the death level, but the level where nothing was sure\r\nagain, the level that made cancer a thing of epidemic proportions,\r\nreplacing statistically all of the insane multitude of things that man\r\ncould do to kill himself. Even the good things that the atom had brought\r\nwere destroyed in the panic that ensued. No matter that you quit. You\r\nare still one of the guilty. You have seen it hidden in her eyes and you\r\nhave seen it in the milky eyes of the twins.\r\n\r\n_Worse than dead._\r\n\r\nDusk became night and finally the doctor came. It had begun to lightning\r\nand a few large drops of rain stroked Rush\'s cheek. Not a good year for\r\nthe farming he had retreated to. Not a good year for anything. He stood\r\nto greet the doctor and the other man with him.\r\n\r\n"Good evening, doctor," he said.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Rush--" the doctor shook hands gingerly, "I hope you don\'t mind me\r\nbringing someone along--this is Mr. North. He is with the County\r\nJuvenile Office." The young doctor smiled. "How is the patient this\r\nevening?"\r\n\r\n"She is the same," John Rush said to the doctor. He turned to the other\r\nman, keeping his face emotionless, hands at his side. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
He had expected\r\nthis for some time. "I think you will be wanting to look at the twins.\r\nThey are by her bed." He opened the door and motioned them in and then\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nHe heard the Juvenile man catch his breath a little. The twins were\r\nplaying again. They had left their vigil at the bedside and they were\r\nmoving swiftly around the small living room, their hands and arms and\r\nlegs moving in some synchronized game that had no meaning--their\r\nmovements quick and sure--their faces showing some intensity, some\r\npurpose. They moved with grace, avoiding obstructions.\r\n\r\n"I thought these children were blind," Mr. North said.\r\n\r\nJohn smiled a little. "It is unnerving. I have seen them play like this\r\nbefore--though they have not done so for a long time--since my wife has\r\nbeen ill." He lowered his head. "They are blind, deaf, and dumb."\r\n\r\n"How old are they?"\r\n\r\n"Twelve."\r\n\r\n"They do not seem to be more than eight--nine at the most."\r\n\r\n"They have been well fed," John said softly.\r\n\r\n"How about schooling, Mr. Rush? The teaching of handicapped children is\r\nnot something that can be done by a person untrained in the field."\r\n\r\n"I have three degrees, Mr. North. When my wife became ill and I began to\r\ncare for them I taught them to read braille. They picked it up very\r\nquickly, though they showed little continued interest in it. I read a\r\nnumber of books in the field of teaching handicapped children ..." He\r\nlet it trail off.\r\n\r\n"Your degrees were in physics, were they not, Mr. Rush?" 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Now the touch\r\nof malice came.\r\n\r\n"That is correct." He sat down in one of the wooden chairs. "I quit\r\nworking long before the witch hunts came. I was never indicted."\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless your degrees are no longer bona fide. All such degrees\r\nhave been stricken from the records." He looked down and John saw that\r\nhis eyes no longer hid the hate. "If your wife dies I doubt that any\r\ncourt would allow you to keep custody of these children."\r\n\r\nA year before--even six months and John would not have protested. Now he\r\nhad to make the effort. "They are my children--such as they are--and I\r\nwill fight any attempt to take them from me."\r\n\r\nThe Juvenile Man smiled without humor. "My wife and I had a child last\r\nyear, Mr. Rush. Or perhaps I should say that a child was born to us. I\r\nam glad that child was born dead--I think my wife is even glad. Perhaps\r\nwe should try again--I understand that you and your kind have left us an\r\neven chance on a normal birth." 

=== Chunk 5 ===
He paused for a moment. "I shall file a\r\npetition with the circuit court asking that the Juvenile Office be\r\nappointed guardians of your children, Mr. Rush. I hope you do not choose\r\nto resist that petition--feeling would run pretty high against an\r\nex-physicist who tried to prove he _deserved_ children." He turned away\r\nstiffly and went out the front door. In a little while Rush heard the\r\ncar door slam decisively.\r\n\r\nThe doctor was replacing things in the black bag. "I\'m sorry, John. He\r\nsaid he was going to come out here anyway so I invited him to come with\r\nme."\r\n\r\nJohn nodded. "My wife?"\r\n\r\n"There is no change."\r\n\r\n"And no chance."\r\n\r\n"There never has been one. The brain tumor is too large and too\r\ninaccessible for treatment or surgery. It will be soon now. I am\r\nsurprised that she has lasted this long. I am prolonging a sure\r\nprocess." He turned away. "That\'s all I can do."\r\n\r\n"Thank you for coming, doctor--I appreciate that." Rush smiled bitterly,\r\nunable to stop himself. "But aren\'t you afraid that your other patients\r\nwill find out?"\r\n\r\nThe doctor stopped, his face paling slightly. "I took an oath when I\r\ngraduated from medical school. Sometimes I want to break that oath, but\r\nI have not so far." He paused. "Try as I may I cannot blame them for\r\nhating you. You know why.

=== Chunk 6 ===
"\r\n\r\nRush wanted to laugh and cry at the same time. "Don\'t you realize that\r\nthe government that punished the men I worked with for their \'criminal\r\nnegligence\' is the same government that commissioned them to do that\r\nwork--that officials were warned and rewarned of the things that small\r\nincreases in radiation might do and that such things might not show up\r\nimmediately--and yet they ordered us ahead?" He stopped for a moment and\r\nput his head down, touching his work-roughened hands to his eyes. "They\r\nput us in prison for refusing to do a job or investigated us until no\r\none could or would trust us in civilian jobs--then when it was done they\r\nput us in prison or worse because the very things we warned them of came\r\ntrue."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps that is true," the doctor said stiffly, "but the choice of\r\nrefusing was still possible."\r\n\r\n"Some of us did refuse to work," Rush said softly. "I did, for one.\r\nPerhaps you think that we alone will bear the blame. You are wrong.\r\nSooner or later the stigma will spread to all of the sciences--and to\r\nyou, doctor. Too many now that you can\'t save; in a little while the\r\nhate will surround you also. When we are gone and they must find\r\nsomething new to hate they will blame you for every malformed baby and\r\nevery death. You think that one of you will find a cure for this thing.\r\nPerhaps you would if you had a hundred years or a thousand years, but\r\nyou haven\'t. They killed a man on the street in New York the other day\r\nbecause he was wearing a white laboratory smock. What do you wear in\r\nyour office, doctor? Hate-blind eyes can\'t tell the difference:\r\nPhysicist, chemist, doctor.... We all look the same to a fool. Even if\r\nthere were a cancer cure that is only a part of the problem. There are\r\nthe babies. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Your science cannot cope with the cause--only mine can do\r\nthat."\r\n\r\nThe doctor lowered his head and turned away toward the door.\r\n\r\nThere was another thing left to say: "If the plumbing went bad in your\r\nhome, doctor, you would call a plumber, for he would be the one\r\ncompetent to fix it." Rush shook his head slowly. "But what happens when\r\nthere are no plumbers left?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe children were by the bed, their hands holding those of the mother.\r\nGently John Rush tugged those hands away and led them toward their own\r\nbed. The small hands were cold in his own and he felt a tiny feeling of\r\nrevulsion as they tightened. Then the feeling slipped away and was\r\nreplaced--as if a current had crossed from their hands to his. It was a\r\nwarm feeling--one that he had known before when they touched him, but\r\nfor which he had never been able to find mental words to express the\r\nsensation.\r\n\r\nSlowly he helped them undress. When they were in the single bed he\r\ncovered them with the top sheet. Their milky eyes surveyed him,\r\nunseeing, somehow withdrawn.\r\n\r\n"I have not known you well," he said. "I left that to her. I have sat\r\nand brooded and buried myself in the earth until it is too late for much\r\nelse." He touched the small heads. "I wish you could hear me. I wish ..."\r\n\r\nOutside on the road a truck roared past. Instinctively he set to hear\r\nit. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
The faces below him did not change.\r\n\r\nHe turned away quickly then and went back out on the porch. He filled\r\nhis pipe and sat down in the old, creaky rocker. A tiny rain had begun\r\nto fall hesitantly--as if afraid of striking the sun-hardened ground.\r\n\r\n_Somewhere out there, somewhere hunted, but not found, the plumbers\r\ngathered. There had been a man--what was his name? Masser--that was it.\r\nHe had been working on a way to inhibit radioactivity--speed up the\r\nhalf-life until they had taken the grant away. If a man can do whatever\r\nhe thinks of--can he undo that which he has done?_\r\n\r\n_Masser was the theoreticist--I was the applier, the one who translated\r\nequations into cold blueprints. And I was good until they ..._\r\n\r\nThey had hounded him back to the land when he quit. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
Others had not been\r\nso lucky. When a whole people panic then an object for their hate must\r\nbe found. A naming. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
An immediate object. He remembered the newspaper\r\nstory that began: "They lynched twelve men, twelve ex-men, in New Mexico\r\nlast night ..."\r\n\r\n_Have I been wrong? Have I done the right thing?_ He remembered the tiny\r\nhands in his own, the blind eyes.\r\n\r\n_Those hands. Why do they make me feel like ..._\r\n\r\nHe let his head slide back against the padded top of the rocking chair\r\nand fell into a light, uneasy sleep.\r\n\r\nThe dreams came as they had before. Tiny, inhumanly capable hands\r\nclutched at him and the sun was hot above. There was a background sound\r\nof hydrogen bombs, heard mutely. He looked down at the hands that\r\ntouched and asked something of his own. The eyes were not milky now.\r\nThey stared up at him, alert and questioning. _What is it you want?_\r\n\r\nThe wind tore holes in tiny voices and there was the sound of laughter\r\nand his wife\'s eyes were looking into his own, sorry only for him, at\r\npeace with the rest. And they formed a ring around him, those three,\r\nhands caught together, enclosing him. _What is it you are saying?_\r\n\r\nIt seemed to him that the words would come clear, but the rain came\r\nthen, great torrents of it, washing all away, all sight and sound....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe awoke and only the rain was true. The tiny rain had increased to a\r\nwind-driven downpour and he was soaked where it had blown under the\r\neaves onto the porch.\r\n\r\nFrom inside the house he heard a cry.\r\n\r\nShe was sitting upright in bed. Her eyes were open and full of pain. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
He\r\nwent quickly to her and touched her pulse. It was faint and reedy.\r\n\r\n"I hurt," she whispered.\r\n\r\nQuickly, as the doctor had taught him, he made up a shot of morphine, a\r\nfull quarter grain, and gave it to her. Her eyes glazed down, but did\r\nnot close.\r\n\r\n"John," she said softly, "the children ... they ... talk to ..." She\r\ntwisted on the bed and he held her with strong arms until the eyes\r\nclosed again and her breathing became easy. He pushed the ruffled hair\r\nback from her eyes and straightened the awry sheets.\r\n\r\nThe vibration of his walking might have wakened the twins. He tiptoed to\r\n_their_ bed--for they refused to be parted even in sleep.\r\n\r\nFor a second he thought that the small night-light had tricked him by\r\nshadows on shadows. He reached down to touch ...\r\n\r\nThey were gone.\r\n\r\nHe fought down sudden panic. Where can two children, deaf and dumb and\r\nblind go in the middle of the night?\r\n\r\nNot far.\r\n\r\nHe opened the door to the kitchen, hand-hunted for the hanging light.\r\nThey were not there--nor were they on the small back porch. The panic\r\npassed critical mass, exploded out of control. He lurched back into the\r\ncombination living room, bed room. He looked under all of the beds and\r\ninto the small closet--everywhere that two children might conceal\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nOutside the rain had increased. He peered out into the lightning night.\r\nA truck horn blew ominously far down the road.\r\n\r\nThe road?\r\n\r\nHe slogged through the mud, instantly soaking as soon as he was out of\r\nshelter, not knowing or caring. Through the front yard, out to the road.\r\nHe could see the lights of the truck coming from far away, two tiny\r\npoints in the darkness. But no twins.\r\n\r\nHe waited helplessly while the truck rushed past, its headlights cutting\r\nholes in the darkness--fearing those lights would outline something that\r\nhe had not seen. But there was nothing.\r\n\r\nFor another eternity he hunted the muddy fields, the small barn and\r\noutbuildings. The clutch of fear made him shout their names, though he\r\nknew they could not hear.\r\n\r\nAnd then, suddenly, all fear was gone--like a summer squall near the\r\nsea, with the sun close behind. It was as if their hands had reached out\r\nand touched him and brought the strange feeling again.\r\n\r\n"They are in the house," he said aloud and knew he was right.\r\n\r\nHe took time to discard muddy shoes on the porch before he opened the\r\ndoor. And they were there--by the mother\'s bed, hands clasped over hers.\r\n\r\nHe felt a tiny chill. Their eyes were watching the door as he opened it,\r\ntheir faces set to receive some stimuli--already set--as if they had\r\nknown he was coming.\r\n\r\nMary was breathing softly. On her face all trace of pain had disappeared\r\nand now there was the tiny smile that had been hers long ago. Her\r\nbreathing was even, but light as forgotten conversation.\r\n\r\nGently he tried to pry their resisting hands away from hers. The hands\r\nfought back with a terrible strength beyond normality. By sheer greater\r\nforce he tore one of the twins away.\r\n\r\nIt was like releasing a bomb. Sudden pain stabbed through his body. The\r\ntwin struggled in his arms, the small hands reaching blindly out for the\r\nthing they had lost. And Mary\'s eyes opened and all of the uncontrolled\r\npain came, back into those eyes. Her body writhed on the bed, tearing\r\nthe coverings away. The twin squirmed away from his slackening hold and\r\nonce again caught at the hands of the mother.\r\n\r\nAll struggle ceased. Mary\'s eyes shut again, the pain lines smoothed\r\nthemselves, the tiny smile flowered.\r\n\r\nHe reached out and touched the small hands on each side of the mother\r\nand the feeling for which there were no words came through more\r\nstrongly than ever before. Tiny voices tried to whisper within the\r\ncorners of his mind, partially blotted, sometimes heard. The _real_\r\nthings, the things of hate and fear and despair retreated beyond the\r\nbugle call that sounded somewhere.\r\n\r\n"She will die," the voice said; one voice for two. "This part of her\r\nwill die."\r\n\r\nAnd then _her_ voice came--as it had been once before when all of the\r\nworld was young. "You must not be afraid, John. I have known for a long\r\ntime--for they were a part of me. And you could not know for your mind\r\nwas hiding and alone. I have seen ..."\r\n\r\nHe cried out and pulled his hands away. Sound died, the room was normal\r\nagain. The milky, white eyes surveyed him, the hands remained locked\r\nsecurely over those of the mother. The thin carven features of the\r\nchildren were emotionless, waiting.\r\n\r\nHe strove for rational meaning within his brain. _These are my\r\nsons--they can not see or hear or speak. They are identical twins--born\r\nwith those defects._\r\n\r\nTake two children, blind them, make them deaf to all sound, cut away\r\ntheir voices. They are identical twins, facing the same environment,\r\nsharing the same heredity of blasted chromosomes. They will have\r\nintelligence and curiosity that increases as they mature. They will not\r\nbe blinded by the senses--the easy way. The first thing they will\r\ndiscover is each other.\r\n\r\nWhat else might they then discover?\r\n\r\nIt has been said that when sight is lost the sense of touch and hearing\r\nincrease to almost unbelievable acuteness--Rush knew that. The blind\r\noften also develop a sense almost like radar which allows them to\r\nperceive an object ahead of them and gives them the ability to follow\r\ntwisting paths.\r\n\r\nTake one child and put him under the disability that the twins were born\r\nwith. As intelligence grows so does single bewilderment. The world is a\r\npuzzling and bewildering place. Braille is a great discovery--a way to\r\ncommunicate with the unknown that lies beyond.\r\n\r\nBut the twins had shown almost no interest in Braille.\r\n\r\nHe reached back down for the tiny hands.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Yes, we can communicate," the single voice that spoke for two said. "We\r\nhave tried with you before, but we could not break through. 

=== Chunk 12 ===
Your mind\r\nspeaks in a language we do not understand, in figures and equations that\r\nare not real to us. Those things lie all through your mind--on the\r\nsurface we have sensed only your pity for us and your hate for the\r\nshadowy ones around you, the ones we do not know. It was a wall we could\r\nnot climb. She is different.\r\n\r\n"A part of her will go with us," the voice said. "There is another place\r\nthat touches this one which we perceive and know more fully than this\r\none."\r\n\r\nThe voice died away and brief pictures of a land of other dimensions\r\nbeyond sight flashed in his brain. He had seen them before imperfectly\r\nin the disquieting dreams. "She must go with us for she can no longer\r\nexist here," the voice said softly. "Perhaps there are others like us to\r\ncome--we do not yet know what we are or whether there will be others\r\nlike us. But we must go now, before we were ready, because of her."\r\n\r\nThe mother\'s voice came. "You must go too. There is nothing here for you\r\nbut sorrow. They will take you, John." A softness touched at him.\r\n"Please, John."\r\n\r\nThe longing was a thing of fire. To cast off the world that had already\r\ngiven him all of the hate and fear that he could stand, that had made\r\nhim worse than a coward. To go with her.\r\n\r\nBut she no longer needed him. She was complete--as they were, only\r\nnecessary to themselves.\r\n\r\nHe could not go.\r\n\r\nDuring the long night he kept the vigil by the bedside; long after any\r\nneed to keep it.\r\n\r\nThe twins were gone and she with them.\r\n\r\nHe could not cry for all tears seemed useless. He said a small prayer,\r\nsomething he had not done in years, over the cold thing left behind.\r\n\r\nThe rain had ceased outside. Somewhere out there in his world there were\r\nmen trying to undo the harm that had been done, harm that he had helped\r\nto do, then retreated from. He had no right to retreat further.\r\n\r\nSomething spoke a requiem sentence in his consciousness, light as late\r\nsunset, only vaguely there. "_We are_ here--we will wait for you ...\r\ncome to us ... come ..."\r\n\r\nHe wrote a short note for the doctor and the others who would come and\r\nhunt and go through the motions that men must live by. Perhaps the\r\ndoctor might even understand.\r\n\r\n"I have gone plumbing," the note said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ August 1957.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.
