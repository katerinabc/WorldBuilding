M. Tenneshaw\r\n\r\n               At poker, Rafferty knew he could beat any\r\n            man alive. Now, needing money badly, he walked\r\n           into the Ganymede Casino looking for a patsy....\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Imagination Stories of Science and Fantasy\r\n                             December 1957\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nRafferty was a gambler of the old school. He didn\'t believe in any of\r\nthe fancy electronic gadgets that the casinos went in for these days,\r\ndidn\'t much care for the psionic games of chance and other tricky and\r\nprobably rigged affairs. Give him a good poker game any time, and he\r\nwould be happy.\r\n\r\nHe stood in the door of the Ganymede Casino, outlining himself against\r\nthe gaudy lights flashing within, standing there patiently. Inside, the\r\nrich and would-be rich of a dozen planets were enjoying themselves,\r\nplaying the brightly-lit games and throwing money around in handfuls.\r\n\r\nRafferty waited for some attention. His hand slid to the bulky roll in\r\nhis pocket--one hundred hundred-credit bills, 10,000 smackers in all.\r\nIt was all Rafferty had. He was here to triple it, or else.\r\n\r\nTomorrow 30,000 had to be handed over to Lee Walsh. It was the result\r\nof the one mistake Rafferty had made.\r\n\r\nWalsh was a big-time gambler, with ulcers and high blood pressure and\r\nten million in the bank. Rafferty was straight middle-time, a man who\r\ngenuinely enjoyed his chancy profession. And Walsh had said, "Why don\'t\r\nyou play something _I_ like to play? All the time poker, poker, poker.\r\nWhy don\'t you switch to something else."\r\n\r\n"I like poker," Rafferty said. "I win at poker. Why switch?"\r\n\r\nWalsh seemed to stiffen. "Let\'s have a little game of planet-faro,\r\nRafferty. Just you and me. I\'m tired of all this poker."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like planet-faro. It\'s a lousy game. All those flashing\r\nlights--it\'s more like pinball than honest-to-darn gambling."\r\n\r\n"You ain\'t chicken, Rafferty?"\r\n\r\n"Chicken?"\r\n\r\n"Yeah. Let\'s try some planet-faro."\r\n\r\nSo they did--and Rafferty had sat by leadenly while Walsh cleaned him\r\nout. Thirty thousand shiny credits down the drain, and the debt due\r\ntomorrow at noon. You didn\'t welsh on Walsh, either. It was sort of a\r\nslogan.\r\n\r\nRafferty didn\'t have the thirty thousand. He had two alternatives: he\r\ncould scrape up the cash somewhere and hand it over, or he could grab\r\nan out-system liner and get going toward Aldebaran, and hope to live.\r\nHe wouldn\'t--not for long.\r\n\r\nHe decided to scrape up the cash. And there was one sure way to do\r\nthat. Poker.\r\n\r\nPoker was getting to be an unpopular game, and there were two reasons\r\nfor it. One was the advent of more popular new types of gambling\r\ndevices; the other reason was that Rafferty was so good it didn\'t pay\r\nto compete against him. He often had trouble getting up a game. People\r\ntended to slink away when they heard Rafferty wanted to play poker. He\r\nplayed it hard and he played it mean, and he didn\'t lose too often.\r\n\r\nThat was why he had come to the Ganymede Casino. On the big\r\npleasure-moon, anyone could find some sort of game going--and if he\r\ncouldn\'t, the house would be glad to provide some competition. Rafferty\r\ndidn\'t much like the idea of playing a house operator, but he was\r\nconfident.\r\n\r\nHe patted the ten g\'s and waited. After a couple of minutes an\r\nimpeccably-dressed man in tails came over to him and smiled courteously.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir?"\r\n\r\n"My name is Rafferty. I\'m looking for a poker game in the house. There\r\none around I can get into?

=== Chunk 2 ===
"\r\n\r\nThe impeccable man frowned slightly. "I don\'t think so,\r\nMr.--ah--Rafferty. Wouldn\'t you care to try our Roto, or the\r\nplanet-faro, or robot roulette? We--"\r\n\r\n"I want to play poker," Rafferty said. The chips were down now; he had\r\nto stick to his specialty.\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'ll see what I can do. Would you wait here, please?

=== Chunk 3 ===
"\r\n\r\nRafferty waited. He waited while the impeccable man cruised around\r\nthe huge gameroom, murmuring gently to someone here, someone there.\r\nIn all cases the response was the same: a shrug, a curious glance in\r\nRafferty\'s direction, a quick and emphatic shake of the head.\r\n\r\nNo one wanted to play. Usually Rafferty could count on some fool\r\nmillionaire anxious to try to best the great Rafferty at five-card\r\nstud. Not today, though. There were no takers.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry, Mr. Rafferty; I couldn\'t seem to promote a game. But the\r\nplanet-faro--"\r\n\r\n"Poker," Rafferty said.\r\n\r\n"Would you object to playing a two-handed game with one of our\r\nemployees?" the usher asked suddenly. "Naturally he\'ll be staked by the\r\nhouse, and I think you\'ll find him fit competition for you."\r\n\r\nRafferty chewed at his lip. He needed the money--and if the house\r\noperator was staked by the casino, it might be possible to cart off\r\nquite a load.\r\n\r\n"Okay," he grunted. "Bring on your shill."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe usher led him to a small, highly-polished card table in the back,\r\nand signalled to a man waiting to one side.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Steel, this is Mr. Rafferty."\r\n\r\n"Hello," Rafferty said.\r\n\r\n"Pleased to meet you," said the other. His voice was a soft purr; his\r\nface, an expressionless mask. Rafferty smiled. He was quick to size up\r\nhis opponents, and this time he could tell he was up against a good one.\r\n\r\n"Chips?"\r\n\r\nA house girl had come by. She was clad only in a strip of something\r\nfilmy across her breasts and another round her middle, and she had a\r\ntrayfull of chips. Rafferty casually handed her the hundred bills and\r\naccepted his stack of chips. She also gave him an unopened deck of\r\ncards.\r\n\r\n"Care to?" Rafferty asked, offering the cards to his opponent.\r\n\r\n"No. Go ahead."\r\n\r\nMethodically Rafferty broke the seal, spilled the cards out, flipped\r\nthe jokers to one side, and riffled through the deck. There were\r\nfifty-two of them, all right, and they looked good. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
He started to\r\nshuffle.\r\n\r\nThe first few hands passed quickly. Steel was a quiet, noncommittal\r\nplayer who seemed to have a tremendous reserve of calmness. It wasn\'t\r\ntoo surprising, thought Rafferty, considering it wasn\'t his dough at\r\nstake. But a shill has professional pride.\r\n\r\nThe first three deals were in the nature of warmups, and Rafferty\r\nemerged from them twenty or thirty credits to the good. He felt the\r\ncards moving the right way; luck was with him tonight. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
He wondered if\r\nhe could come away with a million. The Casino had no limit.\r\n\r\nFourth hand he decided to experiment with some offensive tactics. Steel\r\ndealt; Rafferty scooped up his cards and looked them over. Jack, Four,\r\nEight, Seven, King. Spade, club, spade, heart, diamond. Coolly he\r\nfanned the cards out and pushed a hundred credits toward the middle of\r\nthe table. Steel saw him.\r\n\r\n"How many?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll stand pat."\r\n\r\n"So will I."\r\n\r\n"Five hundred," Rafferty said.\r\n\r\n"See that and raise it a hundred."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll bump to two."\r\n\r\n"I\'m with you," Steel said. "What do you have?"\r\n\r\nWithout a facial flicker Rafferty exposed his hand. "Jack high. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
You?"\r\n\r\n"You beat me. It\'s your kitty."\r\n\r\nRafferty scooped the pot in, frowning inwardly. He\'d made his\r\nbluff--but Steel had been bluffing right along with him. It was only\r\nluck that the little man hadn\'t been holding a Queen.\r\n\r\nRafferty pulled Jack high again on the next deal, took three, came up\r\nwith nothing and folded. On the next hand both men played it cautiously\r\nand Rafferty dropped fifty credits when Steel\'s pair of kings took his\r\ntens.\r\n\r\nNext deal, Rafferty again came up with nothing. Inwardly he cursed; the\r\ncards weren\'t coming as well as they had. He decided to bluff again,\r\nsince the previous attempt hadn\'t yielded any information about his\r\nopponent\'s tactics.\r\n\r\nThis time he pushed the bet up to a thousand before calling.\r\n\r\n"Three sevens," Steel said.\r\n\r\n"You beat me," Rafferty said, and collapsed his hand.\r\n\r\n"Mind if I look?" Steel said.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Rafferty. He was surprised; it was a rank amateur\'s trick\r\nto ask to look at a hand that had been tossed in. Coming from a cool\r\ncustomer like Steel, it didn\'t make much sense.\r\n\r\nBut slowly Rafferty began to fathom the way his opponent\'s mind worked.\r\nAnd slowly, as his genius for the game asserted itself, Rafferty began\r\nto win.\r\n\r\nBy 2100 his pile of chips totalled near fifty thousand. It was enough\r\nto pay off Walsh and still come out with a comfortable profit for the\r\nevening\'s work--but Rafferty didn\'t want to quit. He didn\'t play the\r\ngame that way.\r\n\r\nHe decided to go for a killing. He had Steel figured, now and he could\r\ntake the house for a fortune.\r\n\r\nNursing three jacks and a pair of fours, he pushed the betting higher\r\nand higher. Steel kept right with him.\r\n\r\n"Three thousand? I\'ll see you and raise one."\r\n\r\nWithout letting expression cross his face, Rafferty pushed a few more\r\ncredits out. Then a few more. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Then a few more. Five thousand credits\r\nhung on this deal, now.\r\n\r\nHe remained totally blank-faced. That was the secret of poker: never to\r\ntip off an opponent to anything. Steel was good, but Steel kept giving\r\nhimself away.\r\n\r\nLike now, for instance. Perhaps the shill didn\'t know it, but his right\r\neyebrow was twitching faintly. So far, every time Steel had bluffed a\r\nweak hand, that eyebrow had twitched.\r\n\r\nWell, now Rafferty had him. He had a full house; it was going to take a\r\nbunch of fancy cards to top it. And Steel was almost certainly bluffing.\r\n\r\n"Six thousand," Rafferty said.\r\n\r\n"Seven."\r\n\r\n"Seven five."\r\n\r\nIt reached nine. Finally Rafferty said, "Okay. What do you have?"\r\n\r\nCasually Steel lowered his hand. Jack, Queen, Queen, Queen, Queen. That\r\nmade four Queens.\r\n\r\nHe hadn\'t been bluffing.\r\n\r\nAnd Rafferty was out nine thousand credits.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe kept his composure, but inwardly he was disturbed. By all rights\r\nSteel _had_ to be bluffing--but there they were, four queens.\r\n\r\nThe game progressed. A few curious onlookers had gathered. By playing\r\ncautiously, Rafferty started piling up chips again. His winnings\r\nmounted to a hundred thousand, hundred fifty. He had Steel figured now\r\nfor sure.\r\n\r\nBut it wasn\'t as sure as all that.\r\n\r\nRafferty staked five thousand on a straight flush. Steel saw him and\r\nadded five hundred on top of it.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go with you," Rafferty said. "Here\'s another thousand." Straight\r\nflush, Queen high. Only three hands could possibly beat him--and one\r\nof them was a royal flush. It didn\'t seem likely. Besides, the lower\r\ncorner of Steel\'s mouth was drawn back, as it usually was when he had a\r\nfairly good hand and was playing it big.\r\n\r\nThe chips flew out madly. Rafferty watched the pile grow; neither man\r\nwould let the cat die. Ten, twelve thousand credits now. Fifteen. In\r\nthirty years of poker, Rafferty had never had fifteen thousand credits\r\nriding on one hand. But he was sure he had it.\r\n\r\n"What are you holding?" Steel asked finally.\r\n\r\n"Straight flush, Queen high." He started to reach for the chips.\r\n\r\nSteel\'s mild, purring voice interrupted him. "_What suit?_"\r\n\r\nFor the first time that night Rafferty\'s composure left him. "C-Clubs,"\r\nhe stammered.\r\n\r\n"Spades," Steel said sweetly, and put down the eight to Queen,\r\ninclusive and consecutive.\r\n\r\nIt just didn\'t figure, Rafferty thought glumly. He wasn\'t as annoyed\r\nover the wild improbability of two straight flushes the same hand as he\r\nwas because he had failed to guess Steel\'s facial reaction properly.\r\nHe\'d been dead wrong.\r\n\r\nHe got wronger. Steel sat calmly without saying a word except when\r\nnecessary, and gobbled in the chips. It seemed to Rafferty that Steel\r\nwas reading his every move.\r\n\r\nHe was holding two pair, and played it big. Steel stayed right with\r\nhim, and when the payoff came:\r\n\r\n"Three fours."\r\n\r\nThree fours won. But Steel wouldn\'t have ridden that far on the trio\r\nunless he knew pretty well that Rafferty didn\'t have much to show. He\r\nseemed to _know_. And as the game progressed, he grew less and less\r\nreadable himself. It was a strange reversal for Rafferty, who was\r\naccustomed to detect his opponent\'s idiosyncrasies within three deals\r\nand to play them mercilessly from then on.\r\n\r\n"Two kings," Rafferty said.\r\n\r\n"Two aces."\r\n\r\nRafferty looked down at his pile of chips and counted them. Eight\r\nhundred credits left. Eight hundred lousy credits.\r\n\r\nIt was just enough to book passage to Aldebaran. Rafferty slumped in\r\nhis chair.\r\n\r\nThe gambler in him urged him to go on, to try to win the thirty\r\nthousand he needed and clear out. But another part of him told him\r\nit was futile; Steel was getting sharper and sharper, and it was\r\ninevitable he\'d lose even the remaining eight hundred. He didn\'t want\r\nthat to happen.\r\n\r\nHe rose stiffly.\r\n\r\n"Had enough?" Steel asked.\r\n\r\n"I think so."\r\n\r\n"I hope I haven\'t discouraged you. We can still play some more, if you\r\nlike?"\r\n\r\n"What\'s the use?" Rafferty said hollowly. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
"I can\'t win. And at least\r\nthis way I\'ll be on Aldebaran tomorrow when Walsh and his gunmen come\r\nlooking for me."\r\n\r\n"What\'s that?

=== Chunk 9 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Never mind." Rafferty turned away, scooping up his remaining chips.\r\nHe cashed them in and shambled out the door, still unable fully to\r\nunderstand that for the first time in his life he had met his master\r\nat the poker table.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter Rafferty was gone, the impeccable usher came over to Steel, who\r\nwas sitting patiently by the huge pile of chips.\r\n\r\n"You clean him out?"\r\n\r\n"Just about," Steel said. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
"He had a little left to book passage with."\r\n\r\n"It looked bad for a while, there. He was better than a hundred\r\nthousand ahead of you."\r\n\r\n"It took me some time to detect his playing patterns," the house\r\nman said. "He was very, very good. He\'s the best player I\'ve ever\r\nencountered."\r\n\r\n"But he couldn\'t beat you, natch!"\r\n\r\n"Hardly. Once I had penetrated his defenses, he was at my mercy." Steel\r\nrose, smiling blandly. "I took 9200 credits from him. It\'s thirsty\r\nwork. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
How about a drink?"\r\n\r\n"Sure thing," the impeccable man said. "I guess I can spare a drink for\r\nthe best house operator this casino has." He took an oilcan from his\r\njacket and inserted it at the back of Steel\'s neck. The robot grinned\r\nhappily at the lubrication; his soft photonic eyes beamed.\r\n\r\n"I enjoy playing poker," Steel said. "But someday you must enlarge my\r\ncircuits so I can take part in planet-faro too. It looks like a very\r\ninteresting game."\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
