His face, usually serious\r\nand quietly handsome, had an alive, excited look. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
And the faint lines\r\naround his dark, deep-set eyes were accentuated when he smiled at his\r\nwife.\r\n\r\n"All set, honey. How do I look in my monkey suit?"\r\n\r\nHis wife was sitting stiffly on the flowered couch that was still not\r\ntheirs completely. In her fingers she held a cigarette burned down too\r\nfar. She said, "You look fine, Phil. You look just right." 

=== Chunk 3 ===
She managed a\r\nsmile. Then she leaned forward and crushed the cigarette in the ash\r\ntray on the maple coffee table and took another from the pack.\r\n\r\nHe came to her and touched his hands to her soft blond hair, raising her\r\nface until she was looking into his eyes. "You\'re the most beautiful\r\ngirl I know. Did I ever tell you that?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I think so. Yes, I\'m sure you did," she said, finishing the\r\nritual; but her voice broke, and she turned her head away. Phil sat\r\nbeside her and put his arm around her small shoulders. He had stopped\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\n"Honey, look at me," he said. "It isn\'t going to be bad. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Honestly it\r\nisn\'t. We know exactly how it will be. If anything could go wrong, they\r\nwouldn\'t be sending me; you know that. I told you that we\'ve sent five\r\nun-manned ships up and everyone came back without a hitch."\r\n\r\nShe turned, facing him. There were tears starting in the corners of her\r\nwide, brown eyes, and she brushed them away with her hand.\r\n\r\n"Phil, don\'t go. Please don\'t. They can send Sammy. Sammy doesn\'t have a\r\nwife. Can\'t he go? They\'d understand, Phil. Please!" She was holding his\r\narms tightly with her hands, and the color had drained from her cheeks.\r\n\r\n"Mary, you know I can\'t back out now. How could I? 

=== Chunk 5 ===
It\'s been three\r\nyears. You know how much I\'ve wanted to be the first man to go. Nothing\r\nwould ever be right with me again if I didn\'t go. Please don\'t make it\r\nhard." He stopped talking and held her to him and stroked the back of\r\nher head. He could feel her shoulders shaking with quiet sobs. He\r\nreleased her and stood up.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got to get started, Mary. Will you come to the field with me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'ll come to say good-by." She paused and dropped her eyes. "Phil,\r\nif you go, I won\'t be here when you get back--if you get back. I won\'t\r\nbe here because I won\'t be the wife of a space pilot for the rest of my\r\nlife. It isn\'t the kind of life I bargained for. No matter how much I\r\nlove you, I just couldn\'t take that, Phil. I\'m sorry. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
I guess I\'m not\r\nthe noble sort of wife."\r\n\r\nShe finished and took another cigarette from the pack on the coffee\r\ntable and put it to her lips. Her hand was trembling as she touched the\r\nlighter to the end of the cigarette and drew deeply. Phil stood watching\r\nher, the excitement completely gone from his eyes.\r\n\r\n"I wish you had told me this a long time ago, Mary," Phil said. His\r\nvoice was dry and low. "I didn\'t know you felt this way about it."\r\n\r\n"Yes, you did. I told you how I felt. I told you I could never be the\r\nwife of a space pilot. But I don\'t think I ever really believed it was\r\npossible--not until this morning when you said tonight was the take-off.\r\nIt\'s so stupid to jeopardize everything we\'ve got for a ridiculous\r\ndream!"\r\n\r\nHe sat down on the edge of the couch and took her hands between his.\r\n"Mary, listen to me," he said. "It isn\'t a dream. It\'s real. There\'s\r\nnothing means anything more to me than you do--you know that. But no\r\nman ever had the chance to do what I\'m going to do tonight--no man ever.\r\nIf I backed out now for any reason, I\'d never be able to look at the sky\r\nagain. I\'d be through."\r\n\r\nShe looked at him without seeing him, and there was nothing at all in\r\nher eyes.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s go, if you\'re still going," she finally said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey drove through the streets of the small town with its small\r\nbungalows, each alike. There were no trees and very little grass. It was\r\na new town, a government built town, and it had no personality yet. It\r\nexisted only because of the huge ship standing poised in the take-off\r\nzone five miles away in the desert. Its future as a town rested with the\r\nship, and the town seemed to feel the uncertainty of its future, seemed\r\nready to stop existing as a town and to give itself back to the desert,\r\nif such was its destiny.\r\n\r\nPhil turned the car off the highway onto the rutted dirt road that led\r\nacross the sand to the field where the ship waited. In the distance they\r\ncould see the beams of the searchlights as they played across the\r\ntake-off zone and swept along the top of the high wire fence stretching\r\nout of sight to right and left. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
At the gate they were stopped by the\r\nguard. He read Phil\'s pass, shined his flashlight in their faces, and\r\nthen saluted. "Good luck, colonel," he said, and shook Phil\'s hand.\r\n\r\n"Thanks, sergeant. I\'ll be seeing you next week," Phil said, and smiled.\r\nThey drove between the rows of wooden buildings that lined the field,\r\nand he parked near the low barbed fence ringing the take-off zone. He\r\nturned off the ignition, and sat quietly for a moment before lighting a\r\ncigarette. Then he looked at his wife. She was staring through the\r\nwindshield at the rocket two hundred yards away. Its smooth polished\r\nsurface gleamed in the spotlight glare, and it sloped up and up until\r\nthe eye lost the tip against the stars.\r\n\r\n"She\'s beautiful, Mary. You\'ve never seen her before, have you?"\r\n\r\n"No, I\'ve never seen her before," she said. "Hadn\'t you better go?" Her\r\nvoice was strained and she held her hands closed tightly in her lap.\r\n"Please go now, Phil," she said.\r\n\r\nHe leaned toward her and touched her cheek. Then she was in his arms,\r\nher head buried against his shoulder.\r\n\r\n"Good-by, darling," she said.\r\n\r\n"Wish me luck, Mary?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes, good luck, Phil," she said. He opened the car door and got out.\r\nThe noise of men and machines scurrying around the ship broke the spell\r\nof the rocket waiting silently for flight.\r\n\r\n"Mary, I--" he began, and then turned and strode toward the\r\nadministration building without looking back.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nInside the building it was like a locker room before the big game. The\r\ntension stood alone, and each man had the same happy, excited look that\r\nPhil had worn earlier. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
When he came into the room, the noise and bustle\r\nstopped. They turned as one man toward him, and General Small came up to\r\nhim and took his hand.\r\n\r\n"Hello, Phil. We were beginning to think you weren\'t coming. You all\r\nset, son?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, I\'m all set, I guess," Phil said.\r\n\r\n"I\'d like you to meet the Secretary of Defense, Phil. He\'s over here by\r\nthe radar."\r\n\r\nAs they crossed the room, familiar faces smiled, and each man shook his\r\nhand or touched his arm. He saw Sammy, alone, by the coffee urn. Sammy\r\nwaved to him, but he didn\'t smile. Phil wanted to talk to him, to say\r\nsomething; but there was nothing to be said now. Sammy\'s turn would come\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Secretary," the general said, "this is Colonel Conover. He\'ll be\r\nthe first man in history to see the other side of the Moon. Colonel--the\r\nSecretary of Defense."\r\n\r\n"How do you do, sir. I\'m very proud to meet you," Phil said.\r\n\r\n"On the contrary, colonel. I\'m very proud to meet you. I\'ve been looking\r\nat that ship out there and wondering. I almost wish I were a young man\r\nagain. I\'d like to be going. It\'s a thrilling thought--man\'s first\r\nadventure into the universe. You\'re lighting a new dawn of history,\r\ncolonel. It\'s a privilege few men have ever had; and those who have had\r\nit didn\'t realize it at the time. Good luck, and God be with you."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, sir. I\'m aware of all you say. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
It frightens me a little."\r\n\r\nThe general took Phil\'s arm and they walked to the briefing room. There\r\nwere chairs set up for the scientists and Air Force officers directly\r\nconnected with the take-off. They were seated now in a semicircle in\r\nfront of a huge chart of the solar system. Phil took his seat, and the\r\nlast minute briefing began. It was a routine he knew by heart. He had\r\ngone over and over it a thousand times, and he only half listened now.\r\nHe kept thinking of Mary outside, alone by the fence.\r\n\r\nThe voice of the briefing officer was a dull hum in his ears.\r\n\r\n"... And orbit at 18,000-mph. You will then accelerate for the breakaway\r\nto 24,900-mph for five minutes and then free-coast for 116 hours\r\nuntil--"\r\n\r\nPhil asked a few questions about weather and solar conditions. And then\r\nthe session was done. They rose and looked at each other, the same\r\nunanswered questions on each man\'s face. There were forced smiles and\r\nhandshakes. They were ready now.\r\n\r\n"Phil," the general said, and took him aside.\r\n\r\n"Sir?"\r\n\r\n"Phil, you\'re ... you feel all right, don\'t you, son?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir. I feel fine. Why?"\r\n\r\n"Phil, I\'ve spent nearly every day with you for three years. I know you\r\nbetter than I know myself in many ways. And I\'ve studied the\r\npsychologist\'s reports on you carefully. Maybe it\'s just nervousness,\r\nPhil, but I think there\'s something wrong. Is there?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir. There\'s nothing wrong," Phil said, but his voice didn\'t carry\r\nconviction. He reached for a cigarette.\r\n\r\n"Phil, if there is anything--anything at all--you know what it might\r\nmean. You\'ve got to be in the best mental and physical condition of your\r\nlife tonight. You know better than any man here what that means to our\r\nsuccess. I think there is something more than just natural apprehension\r\nwrong with you. Want to tell me?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOutside, the take-off zone crawled with men and machines at the base of\r\nthe rocket. For ten hours, the final check-outs had been in progress;\r\nand now the men were checking again, on their own time. The thing they\r\nhad worked toward for six years was ready to happen, and each one felt\r\nthat he was sending just a little bit of himself into the sky. Beyond\r\nthe ring of lights and moving men, on the edge of the field, Mary stood.\r\nHer hands moved slowly over the top of the fence, twisting the barbs of\r\nwire. But her eyes were on the ship.\r\n\r\nAnd then they were ready. A small group of excited men came out from the\r\nadministration building and moved forward. The check-out crews climbed\r\ninto their machines and drove back outside the take-off zone. And,\r\nalone, one man climbed the steel ladder up the side of the\r\nrocket--ninety feet into the air. At the top he waved to the men on the\r\nground and then disappeared through a small port.\r\n\r\nMary waved to him. "Good-by," she said to herself, but the words stuck\r\ntight in her throat.\r\n\r\nThe small group at the base of the ship turned and walked back to the\r\nfence. And for an eternity the great ship stood alone, waiting. Then,\r\nfrom deep inside, a rumble came, increasing in volume to a gigantic roar\r\nthat shook the earth and tore at the ears. Slowly, the first manned\r\nrocket to the Moon lifted up and up to the sky.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor a long time after the rocket had become a tiny speck of light in the\r\nheavens, she stood holding her face in her hands and crying softly to\r\nherself. And then she felt the touch of a hand on her arm. She turned.\r\n\r\n"Phil! Oh, Phil." She held tightly to him and repeated his name over and\r\nover.\r\n\r\n"They wouldn\'t let me go, Mary," he said finally. "The general would not\r\nlet me go."\r\n\r\nShe looked at him. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
His face was drawn tight, and there were tears on his\r\ncheeks. "Thank, God," she said. "It doesn\'t matter, darling. The only\r\nthing that matters is you didn\'t go."\r\n\r\n"You\'re right, Mary," he said. His voice was low--so low she could\r\nhardly hear him. "It doesn\'t matter. Nothing matters now." He stood with\r\nhis hands at his sides, watching her. And then turned away and walked\r\ntoward the car.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
