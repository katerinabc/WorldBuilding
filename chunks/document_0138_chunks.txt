Walt Sheldon_\r\n\r\n\r\n The Computer could do no wrong. Then it was asked\r\n a simple little question by a simple little man.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe little man had a head like an old-fashioned light bulb and a smile\r\nthat seemed to say he had secrets from the rest of the world. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
He didn\'t\r\ntalk much, just an occasional "Oh," "Mm" or "Ah." Krayton figured he\r\nmust be all right, though. After all he\'d been sent to Computer City by\r\nthe Information Department itself, and his credentials must have been\r\nchecked in a hundred ways and places.\r\n\r\n"Essentially each computer is the same," said Krayton, "but adjusted to\r\ntranslate problems into the special terms of the division it serves."\r\n\r\nKrayton had a pleasant, well-behaved impersonal voice. He was in his\r\nthirties and mildly handsome. He considered himself a master of the\r\ntechnique of building a career in Computer City--he knew how to stay\r\nwithin the limits of directives and regulations and still make\r\ndecisions, or rather to relay computer decisions that kept his\r\nresponsibility to a minimum.\r\n\r\nNow Krayton spoke easily and freely to the little man. As public liaison\r\nofficer he had explained the computer system hundreds of times. He knew\r\nit like a tech manual.\r\n\r\n"But is there any _real_ central control, say in case of a breakdown or\r\nsomething of that sort?" The little man\'s voice was dry as lava ash, dry\r\nas the wastes between and beyond the cities. Tanter, was the name he\'d\r\ngiven--Mr. Tanter. His contact lenses were so thick they made his eyes\r\nseem to bulge grotesquely. He had a faint stoop and wore a black tunic\r\nwhich made his look like one of the reconstructed models of prehistoric\r\nbirds called crows that Krayton had seen in museums.\r\n\r\n"Of course, of course," said Krayton, answering the question. "It\'s\r\nnever necessary to use the _All_ circuit. But we could very easily in\r\ncase of a great emergency."\r\n\r\n"The _All_ circuit? What is that?" 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Mr. Tanter asked.\r\n\r\nKrayton gestured and led the little man down the long control bank.\r\nTheir steps made precise clicks on the layaplast floor. The stainless\r\nsteel walls threw back tinny echoes. The chromium molding glistened,\r\nalways pointing the way--the straight and mathematical way. They were in\r\nthe topmost section of the topmost building of Computer City. The\r\nseveral hundred clean, solid, wedding-cake structures of the town could\r\nbe seen from the polaflex window.\r\n\r\n"The _All_ circuit puts every machine in the city to work on any\r\nselection-problem that\'s fed into our master control here. Each machine\r\nwill give its answer in its own special terms, but actually they will\r\nall work on the same problem. To use a grossly simple example, let us\r\nsay we wish to know the results of two-and-two, but we wish to know it\r\nin terms of _total security_. That is, we wish to know that two-plus-two\r\nmeans twice as many nourishment units for the Department of Foods, twice\r\nas many weapons for the Department of War, but is perhaps not\r\nnecessarily true according to the current situational adjustment in the\r\nDepartment of Public Information.\r\n\r\n"At any rate, we would set up our problem on the master, pushing the\r\nbutton _Two_, then the button _Plus_, and the button _Two_ again as on a\r\nprimitive adding machine. Then we would merely throw the _All_ switch. A\r\nshort time later the total answer to our problem would be relayed back\r\nfrom every computer, and the cross-comparison factors canceled out, so\r\nthat we would have the result in terms of the familiar _Verdict\r\nStatement_. And, as everyone knows, the electronically filed _Verdict\r\nStatements_ make the complete record of directives for the behavior of\r\nour society."\r\n\r\n"Very interesting," said Mr. Tanter, the little crow-like man. He\r\nblinked rapidly, stared at the switch marked _All_ that Krayton was\r\npointing out to him.\r\n\r\nKrayton now folded his hands in front of his official gold-and-black\r\ntunic, looked up into the air and rocked gently back and forth on his\r\nheels as he talked. He was really talking to himself now although he\r\nseemed to address Tanter. "You can see that the Computer System is quite\r\nunder our control in spite of what these rebellious, underground groups\r\nsay."\r\n\r\n"Underground groups?" asked Mr.

Tanter mildly. Just his left eye seemed\r\nto blink this time. And the edge of his mouth gave the veriest twitch.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you know," said Krayton, "the organization that calls itself the\r\nPrims. Prim for Primitive. They leave little cards and pamphlets around\r\ndamning the Computer System. I saw one the other day. It had a big title\r\nsplashed across it: OUR NEW TYRANT--THE COMPUTER. The article complained\r\nthat some of the new labor and food regulations were the result of\r\nconscious reasoning on the part of The Computer. Devices to build the\r\nComputer bigger and bigger and bigger at the expense of ordinary\r\nworkers. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
You know the sort of thing."\r\n\r\n"But it is true that the living standard is going down all the time,\r\nisn\'t it?" asked Mr. Tanter, keeping his ephemeral smile. "What about\r\nthose three thousand starvation deaths up in Hydroburgh?"\r\n\r\nKrayton waved an impatient hand. "There will always be problems like\r\nthat here and there." He turned and stared almost reverently at the long\r\ncontrol rack. "Be thankful we have The Computer to solve them."\r\n\r\n"But the deaths were due to diverting that basic carbon shipment down\r\nhere to Computer City for computer-building, weren\'t they?"\r\n\r\n"Now, there--you see how powerful the propaganda of the Prims can be?"\r\nKrayton put his hands on his hips. "That statement is not true! It\r\nsimply isn\'t true at all! 

=== Chunk 6 ===
It was analyzed on The Computer some days ago.\r\nHere, let me show you." He took several steps down the corridor again\r\nand stopped at another panel.\r\n\r\n"We first collected from the various departments--Food, Production,\r\nLabor and so forth--all the _possible_ causes of the starvation deaths\r\nin Hydroburgh. Computer Administration had its machine translate them\r\ninto symbols. We\'re getting a huge new plant and machine addition over\r\nat Administration, by the way.\r\n\r\n"At any rate, we simply registered all the possible causes with the\r\nMaster Computer, threw in this circuit marked _Validity Selector_. Out\r\nof all those causes The Computer picked the one that was most valid. The\r\nHydroburgh tragedy was due to lack of foresight on the part of\r\nHydroburgh\'s planners. If they\'d had a proper stockpile of basic carbon\r\nthe thing never would have happened."\r\n\r\n"But no community ever stockpiles," said the little man.\r\n\r\n"That," said Krayton, "doesn\'t alter the fundamental fact. The Computer\r\nnever lies." He drew himself up stiffly as he said this. Then abruptly\r\nhe consulted the chronometer on the far wall.\r\n\r\n"Excuse me just a moment, Mr. Tanter," he said. "It\'s time to feed the\r\ndaily tax computation from Finance. We have to start a little earlier on\r\nthat these days--the new taxes, you know."\r\n\r\nAs Krayton moved off Tanter\'s thin smile widened just a little. As soon\r\nas Krayton was out of sight he stepped with his odd, crow-like stride to\r\nthe numerical panel, punched two-plus-two, then adjusted the Operations\r\npointer to HOLD. After that he punched three-plus-one, and HOLD once\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nHe moved over to the _Validity Selector_, switched the numerical panel\r\nin, closed the circuit.\r\n\r\nIn his dry voice he murmured to the whole control rack: "Three-plus-one\r\nmakes four, two-plus-two makes four. Three-plus-one, two-plus-two--tell\r\nme which is really true."\r\n\r\nAll through the master computer relays clicked and tubes glowed as the\r\nproblem was sent to all the sub-computers in their own special terms.\r\nFood, Production, Labor, Public Information, War, Peace, Education,\r\nScience and so forth.\r\n\r\nAll over Computer City the solenoids moved their contacts and the\r\nfilaments turned cherry red. Oscillating circuits hummed silently to\r\nthemselves in perfect Q. The life warmth of hysteresis pulsed and\r\nthrobbed along wires and channels. _Three-plus-one, two-plus-two--tell\r\nme which is really true._ The problem criss-crossed in and out, around,\r\nabout, checking, cross-checking, re-checking as The Computer \'thought\'\r\nabout the problem.\r\n\r\nWhich was really true?\r\n\r\nEven before Krayton returned parts of The Computer had begun to get red\r\nhot. It hummed in some places and in the other places relays going back\r\nand forth in indecision made an unhealthy rattling noise.\r\n\r\nLittle Mr. Tanter beamed happily to himself as he recalled the words of\r\nan old directive The Computer itself had issued in the matter of public\r\nthought control. _When a brain is faced with two absolutely equal\r\nalternatives complete breakdown invariably results._\r\n\r\nMr. Tanter kept smiling and rocked back and forth on his feet as Krayton\r\nhad done. Before nightfall The Computer would be a useless and\r\noverheated mass of plastic and metal!\r\n\r\nHe took a printed folder from his pocket and casually dropped it on the\r\nfloor where someone would be sure to find it. It was one of the\r\npamphlets the Prims were always leaving around.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ March 1954.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.
