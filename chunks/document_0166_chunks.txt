]\r\n\r\n\r\nThey climbed the hill together, arm in arm. At the crest, they stopped\r\nand looked back into the moon-brightened valley where the thin needle\r\nof metal pointed skyward.\r\n\r\nThe night wind blew her dress tightly about her slim legs, and she\r\nreached a hand to her head to keep the blonde curls from whipping about\r\nher face.\r\n\r\nHe put his arm about her waist, squeezed her gently. "Only a few more\r\nhours to wait," he said, reassuringly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe great ship from beyond the Galaxy drew alongside the tiny planet,\r\nmatched its orbit, cut its drive, and drifted slightly toward the lone\r\nmoon. The ship was nearly as large as the planet itself, but there was\r\nno interchange of gravity between the two bodies, for the ship was of a\r\nsubstance made beyond the stars.\r\n\r\nInspector Ryt looked at his sky chart. Yes, it was Sol III. Then he\r\nlooked through the port hole at his left and adjusted the lens. Then he\r\nswore by the Seven Sister Suns of Sagittarius.\r\n\r\nThe lens showed him the moonlit side of the planet. There were lights\r\nthere, little rows of lights forming checkered patterns in various\r\nareas. And there were other lights, greater lights which flickered\r\nviciously among the patterns, leaving squat, circular clouds above them.\r\n\r\nRyt\'s cheeks puffed out in uncontrollable wrath. "Contaminated!" he\r\nbellowed. "And they are warring on each other!"\r\n\r\nHe turned from the lens, his gross body glowing in red anger.\r\n"Krembyl!" he screamed. "Krembyl!"\r\n\r\nThe door at the far side of the room swung open, and the entity called\r\nKrembyl fluttered in. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
"Yes?" he asked, his body trembling at the manner\r\nin which his name had rung out.\r\n\r\n"Your records show Sol III as sterile. Decontaminated!"\r\n\r\n"Y-yes, sir," Krembyl stammered. "I--I took care of it myself. Just\r\na--a few days ago...."\r\n\r\n"Look!" shouted Inspector Ryt. "Look for yourself!"\r\n\r\nKrembyl went hesitantly to the lens and adjusted himself before it. He\r\nsaw the sparkling lights below, the flashes, the tiny clouds, and his\r\nbody went pale pink with the shame of defeat.\r\n\r\n"I--I am sorry, sir." He turned from the instrument, his pale pink\r\nfading to an ashen gray. "I just don\'t understand it. I have renovated\r\nthe planet several times...."\r\n\r\n"_Several times?_"\r\n\r\n"Why, y-yes." Krembyl hurried to a shelf of documents along one wall,\r\nscanned the titles briefly selected one, and returned to the desk.\r\n"Here it is, sir. You will find my reports quite in order, sir."\r\n\r\n"Damn the reports!" snapped the inspector. "I want to know why this\r\nplanet hasn\'t been cared for properly!" He darkened his body with a\r\nscowl.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKrembyl fumbled the document open, flipped a few pages. "Here it is,\r\nsir. All written down, sir. All in correct order, sir.\r\n\r\n"_Cosmos 66, 9238_," he read. "_Malignant growth noted._\r\n\r\n"_Cosmos 67, 9238 Decontamination process begun._\r\n\r\n"_Method: Entire planet encircled with electrical impulses which caused\r\nhydrogen and oxygen to unite into a heavy liquid. Process continued for\r\na full 40 of planet revolutions._\r\n\r\n"_Result: Planet covered with the liquid to an average depth of 30\r\nfathoms. Contaminating element, being oxygen-breathing, could not\r\npossibly exist under such conditions._"\r\n\r\n"Fool!" barked Ryt. "Some of them probably floated to the surface on\r\nsome of the buoyant vegetation. They may even have made rafts of the\r\nvegetation. Or a boat!"\r\n\r\n"They are exceedingly persistent and adaptable, sir," Krembyl admitted.\r\n"And there were other times...." He broke off to fumble through the\r\ndocumented account. "Yes, here it is, all written down in correct\r\nform...."\r\n\r\n"Damn the reports!" snapped the inspector. "Tell me what happened!"\r\n\r\n"Well, sir," said Krembyl, scanning the pages carefully, "it was back\r\nin 9237. I noticed the malignancy and took proper measures. I took\r\nthe planet from its orbit and into an area remote from the Sol unit.\r\nThere, in the intense cold, the polar caps grew larger and larger until\r\nthey finally extended over the land portions. Even the middle belt\r\nbecame frigid. Then I swung the planet back near Sol and let it soak in\r\ntropical heat. I subjected the planet to this treatment three--or was\r\nit four?--times before placing it back permanently in its orbit."\r\n\r\n"Dolt!" said Ryt. "They probably hid away in deep crevices. Probably\r\nremained alive through the treatment by eating each other!" He looked\r\nat the unhappy Krembyl for a devastating minute. "You should have used\r\nfire. _Burned them out!_"\r\n\r\n"But I _did_, sir!" Krembyl said, hurriedly. "I _did_!" He fumbled\r\nrapidly through the pages. "Here it is, right here! All written out!\r\n\r\n"_Nebula 42, 9235. Persistence of malignant contamination noted...._"\r\n\r\nHe broke off abruptly as the inspector\'s body turned to brittle\r\nobsidion.\r\n\r\n"H-m-mm.... A-hh.... Well, sir, finding them confined in an area of\r\nparticularly lush vegetation, I burned them out, chased them with fire\r\ninto arid regions, and swept the garden of plant growth completely away\r\nwhere they could not find it again."\r\n\r\n"But it is obvious that you failed! Even if two of them succeeded in\r\nescaping...."\r\n\r\n"And before that, sir," Krembyl hurried on. "Before that, I shook the\r\nland masses violently, rent great fissures that permitted the gasses\r\nand flames to leap out from the central core and spread destruction. I\r\nsubmerged huge infected areas into the depths of the seas, and brought\r\nup new land masses, fresh and clean, into the light of Sol. I even...."\r\n\r\n"Enough! 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Enough!" Ryt hit the desk before him a ponderous blow.\r\n"Silence, fool, while I think!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKrembyl turned a sickly shade of green and let the document close in\r\nweary hands.\r\n\r\nSol III had been a particularly painful lancet in his side, even more\r\nso than had yet been guessed. He hoped the inspector would probe no\r\ndeeper. But even as his hopes kindled, they became but ashes.\r\n\r\n"There are a few more things I do not understand about this," Inspector\r\nRyt was saying. "When this planet was formed from the elements of\r\nspace, there was no contamination. It was virgin. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
And, yet, it is now\r\ncontaminated. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Why?"\r\n\r\nKrembyl felt his inners churning fearfully. His whole body was so\r\nfilled with trembling that he could not bring himself to fashion words.\r\n\r\nRyt\'s body grew blacker in the silence. "_Why?_" The word was lightning\r\nfrom the Stygian depths. "WHY?"\r\n\r\nKrembyl\'s body rent asunder, and the effort of reknitting himself so\r\nweakened him that his voice was scarcely a whisper. "They--they came\r\nfrom Sol V, sir."\r\n\r\nThe thunderous blow upon the desk top mingled with Ryt\'s bellow of\r\nfury. Together, the sounds shook the room and nearly disintegrated\r\nKrembyl\'s hastily reassembled body.\r\n\r\n"Dolt! Ass!" screamed Ryt, his body assuming the blackness of the dust\r\ncloud of Orion. "You failed to stop them on Sol V! You not only let\r\nthem blow the planet into tiny bits, but you also let them escape to\r\nSol III! And here all your efforts of extermination have failed again\r\nand again!"\r\n\r\nHe wheeled to look through the lens again. Three brilliant flashes,\r\ngreater than the others, sparkled almost simultaneously upon the\r\nplanet\'s troubled surface, sent up mushrooms of dust and shattered\r\natoms. "And is this what happened on Sol V?"\r\n\r\n"Y-yes," stammered Krembyl. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
"The same thing. Just before ... just\r\nbefore...."\r\n\r\nHe could not bring himself to complete the statement.\r\n\r\nRyt leaped from the seat at the desk, his body black and bloated.\r\n"Then there is not a moment to lose! Exterminate before this planet is\r\ndestroyed! And let none escape!"\r\n\r\n"But, sir," pleaded Krembyl, "I have tried everything--fire, floods,\r\nice...."\r\n\r\n"Then try something else!" Ryt roared.\r\n\r\nKrembyl drifted slowly towards the door.\r\n\r\n"Wait!"\r\n\r\nKrembyl stopped obediently.\r\n\r\n"What about Sol IV?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Sol IV is all right, sir." Krembyl brightened a shade as he\r\nturned. "There is not the slightest trace of contamination. That planet\r\nmust have been on the far side of Sol when--when they escaped Sol V.\r\nI am certain, sir, you will find the rest of the system quite in\r\norder...."\r\n\r\n"Enough! Begin the extermination! And this time employ drastic\r\nmeasures. Take the planet to the rim of Sol itself and bake it to a\r\ncrisp before they infest the entire galaxy."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
Immediately, sir." Krembyl turned again to the door,\r\nthankful his fate had not been worse.\r\n\r\n"And don\'t fail this time!" warned Ryt. "If you lose Sol III as you\r\nlost Sol V, I\'ll see to it that you put them both back together again,\r\npiece by piece, if it takes you six eons beyond your retirement age!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe moon, with its strange accompanying cloud, had nearly set. The blue\r\nof the eastern sky was fading into apple-green. There was a roaring\r\nswish of sound, a shattering blast of energy, a whistling sigh, then\r\na remote whisper. The needle-like structure from the valley became a\r\nflickering pin point in the sky.\r\n\r\nThe girl leaned her blonde head against the shoulder of the man beside\r\nher. "We--we are free?" Her voice was but a whisper.\r\n\r\nHe adjusted the ra-vis to get a clearer view of Earth and its\r\nsurrounding space. The view was but slightly distorted by the hot gases\r\nof the stern tubes. "Yes," he said, struggling to keep his nervousness\r\nfrom playing havoc with his vocal cords. "Free. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
Free from a mad world!"\r\nHe squeezed her hand reassuringly, his eyes intent upon the screen.\r\n\r\nSomething had gone wrong. The earth had slid to one edge of the screen.\r\nHe readjusted the ra-vis. The space-cloud of black that had hovered\r\nnear the moon that night had also shifted its position. It was now\r\nbetween the earth and the sun, and the earth seemed to be following\r\nit.... The furrow between his dark brows deepened, but he said nothing.\r\n\r\n"Just think of it!" she said, her voice a song. "Mars! And a brave new\r\nworld!"\r\n\r\nHe put an arm about her shoulders and took his eyes from the screen.\r\nIt was absurd to think the earth was moving sunward. It was probably\r\nmerely due to some space aberration....\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said, picking up her enthusiasm. "And after that--the\r\n_stars_!"\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
