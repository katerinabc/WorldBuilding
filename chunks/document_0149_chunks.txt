"Won\'t you join me,\r\ngentlemen?"\r\n\r\n"Listen to him," sputtered Geitz. "He\'s enjoying this. He likes being\r\ncooked in a cubby-holed space ship; he likes to sit here day after day\r\nwhile the floor beneath him is burning his shoes."\r\n\r\nLejeune, the wiry French biologist, lowered the half-empty bottle from\r\nhis lips and scowled at the ship\'s doctor. "But not for long, my dear\r\nGeitz, not for long. Our fate lies within a few hours. The ship will be\r\ndrawn closer and closer to the sun. The heat will become unbearable.\r\nThen--pffffft!--the ship will be a little spark--"\r\n\r\n"You\'re a pain," growled Captain Rogers.\r\n\r\nLejeune raised his eyebrows quizzically and grinned. He said nothing,\r\nwalked to a bunk, and sat down beside Lane, the pilot.\r\n\r\nThe silence continued for some time, broken only by the footfalls of\r\nCaptain Rogers in his nervous pacing. There was nothing to do but wait.\r\nThe four of them knew that. The ship couldn\'t hold out much longer; it\r\nwould burst under the terrific strain, would be reduced instantly to a\r\ncinder by the sun\'s blistering heat.\r\n\r\nThey were trapped, falling into the sun inevitably.\r\n\r\n"One meteorite," said Lejeune casually, "one hurtling fragment of some\r\ninterstellar gadabout which chose to cross our path at the wrong time.\r\nThat\'s all it took to smash our jets and send the four of us toward\r\nthat fiery mass."\r\n\r\n"Shut up!" 

=== Chunk 2 ===
snapped Rogers. "It\'s bad enough without your moaning!"\r\n\r\nOblivious to the captain\'s words, Lejeune patted his bottle\r\naffectionately.\r\n\r\n"In the name of heaven!" growled Geitz, leaping to his feet. "Why do we\r\nsit here like a lot of mummies? There\'s a rocket capsule aboard, you\r\nsay, with sufficient power to carry one of us to Mercury. Why don\'t we\r\nuse it? I ask you, Rogers."\r\n\r\n"You answered that yourself," the captain said bluntly. "True,\r\nthat rocket capsule can carry one of us to Mercury. Just one,\r\nunderstand--there\'s room for but one person in a capsule. I ask\r\nyou--which one of us would that be?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s beside the point," muttered Geitz, as he wiped beads of\r\nperspiration from his forehead. "You don\'t seem to realize what\r\nvaluable information we possess. Think of that cylinder in the supply\r\nroom. It contains all the photographs we took of Mercurian plant and\r\nanimal life, and the photos of Vulcan. To say nothing of the data\r\nconcerning the sun\'s corona--why, our analysis would be of infinite\r\nvalue to earth scientists!"\r\n\r\n"Quite so," Rogers said crisply. "But while you\'re thinking about\r\nthat, don\'t forget the three men who would be left aboard this\r\nship--think of what would happen to them." He stopped his pacing and\r\nshook a finger under the doctor\'s imposing Van Dyke. "Do you know what\r\nwould happen to them, Geitz? They\'d burn alive--they\'d cook--while on\r\nearth your scientists would hop around in glee over a few photographs\r\nof Mercury!"\r\n\r\nGeitz sat down heavily, exhausted.\r\n\r\n"The doc\'s right, Rogers," Lane interposed. "There\'s no reason for all\r\nfour of us dying when it\'s possible for one to gain freedom. And for\r\nGod\'s sake if you\'re going to do something do it in a hurry! We\'ll burn\r\nbefore you make up your mind!"\r\n\r\n"My mind\'s made up," Rogers retorted. "I\'m staying. In case you\'ve\r\nforgotten, a captain is the last man to leave his ship. As for you\r\nthree, fight it out among yourselves. Draw straws--anything. The\r\nconsequences will be your worry."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll stay," murmured Lejeune, lifting his bottle to his lips.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean that," said the youthful Lane. "You want to go--we all\r\nwant to go--but it can only be one of us."\r\n\r\nHe fell silent, placing his head in his hands. Rogers resumed his\r\npacing.\r\n\r\nThe ship drifted on, slowly it seemed, ever nearing the solar furnace,\r\nfalling toward the flames that were eager to dissolve the tiny cruiser\r\nlocked in an unyielding gravitational pull.\r\n\r\n"Soon," mused Lejeune. "Soon we\'ll be too close for the rocket capsule\r\nto break free of the sun\'s drag. Then there will be no doubt as to what\r\nwill be done. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Ha!"\r\n\r\n"Damnation!" yelled Lane, jerking erect. "How can you be so confounded\r\nhappy about it all? We\'re falling into the sun, man--doesn\'t that have\r\nany effect upon you?"\r\n\r\nLejeune shrugged. "Perhaps. We are falling into the sun, yes. We\'ll\r\ndie, no doubt, so my future is definite. I know what is coming. Soon I\r\nshall be but a tiny spark, drifting nowhere in a big sun. Do I regret\r\nbeing a tiny spark? Not when I have my scotch with me."\r\n\r\n"You\'re a smart guy," Lane thrust at him. "Maybe you can tell us how to\r\nchoose the rocket capsule\'s passenger."\r\n\r\n"Simple, my friend. The captain won\'t go--he must stay with the ship. I\r\nhave no relatives, only my scotch, so I am satisfied. The doctor must\r\nstay--he\'s too fat to get in the capsule. M\'sieu Lane, the honor is\r\nyours. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Au revoir."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be crazy--"\r\n\r\n"Do not worry about us, my friend. We will find something to do.\r\nPerhaps I can interest the doctor and the captain in three-handed\r\nbridge. If not, we\'ll wait. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
We\'ll go soon--sssss! 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Like that."\r\n\r\nLane buried his face in his hands again.\r\n\r\nFor a few moments there was an unbroken silence. From the\r\ndouble-insulated hulls emanated a dry hotness that scorched the already\r\nblistered air. The hotness increased, rising to a fierce, intolerable\r\ndegree. It grew, inexorably, pressing against their lungs--\r\n\r\nLane floundered crazily, leaped across the control room and plucked a\r\ngun from his locker. "This\'ll make it easier," he gasped, lifting the\r\nweapon to his head. "Somebody\'s got to fly that capsule--"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Lane plucked a gun from his locker. "This\'ll make it\r\neasier," he gasped, lifting the weapon to his head._]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor ten minutes no one spoke. It was hard to speak--each breath was a\r\ntorture to the lungs.\r\n\r\n"Lejeune," said Geitz finally, in short gasps, "in God\'s name will you\r\nget into the capsule and take that cylinder to Mercury? One of us has\r\ngot to go--for Lane\'s sake!"\r\n\r\nLejeune, sprawled out on the pilot\'s bunk, made no reply. The captain\r\nstood before the dull gray view-screen, watched him a moment,\r\nthoughtfully. "Can\'t you reverse the field?" he asked at length. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
"I\'d\r\nlike to see the System just once more."\r\n\r\nRogers had already made a few deft motions on the instrument panel.\r\nPresently, the screen came to life. Its scope possessed a bright\r\nhalo--the sun\'s glow. In the center of the screen Mercury was visible,\r\na faint, receding globe. Rogers moved the scope slowly until he found\r\nthe feeble point of light that designated the earth. He watched it\r\ngrimly. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
"Satisfied, Geitz?"\r\n\r\n"Dr. Geitz is dead," came Lejeune\'s monotone.\r\n\r\nRogers turned. The doctor lay on his face, immobile and silent.\r\n\r\n"The heat," said Rogers, "and his age."\r\n\r\nThey carried him to the supply room, laid him beside the inert form of\r\nLane.\r\n\r\nThe two men stood watching earth\'s dull glimmer on the screen. The heat\r\npressed them relentlessly, always increasing--\r\n\r\n"Take the capsule, Lejeune. You\'ve no reason to remain."\r\n\r\n"I prefer to stay, Captain Rogers. You have relatives--it is only\r\nproper that you should fly the capsule."\r\n\r\n"Under any circumstances, Lejeune, the captain does not leave his ship\r\nin distress. Should I return to earth without the rest of you, I would\r\nlose my rank unquestionably. Now, before we draw too close, take the\r\ncylinder to Mercury! You\'re a fool not to!"\r\n\r\n"M\'sieu Rogers, I possess magnificent renown as a fool. I shall remain."\r\n\r\n"But the cylinder--"\r\n\r\n"The cylinder, Captain Rogers, be damned."\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other a long minute. Rogers, stripped to the waist,\r\nperspiring, his thick black hair hanging in his eyes; Lejeune, small,\r\nwiry, faint traces of a smile lurking on his lips.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the floor shook beneath them. A violent shudder passed through\r\nthe ship from stem to stern. The momentum of the sunward fall increased.\r\n\r\nRegaining his balance, Rogers gasped, "Good God--the capsule!"\r\n\r\nThey saw a flash of light on the screen, saw the tiny rocket streak\r\nfor Mercury in a flare of brilliance. It dwindled rapidly to a\r\nreceding speck that was swallowed in the depths of space.\r\n\r\nSpeechless, Rogers and Lejeune raced to the supply room. They found\r\nLane there, but no Geitz and no cylinder. Needles on the face of the\r\ncapsule compartment jutting out from the wall registered zero.\r\n\r\n"He was faking," said Rogers. "He wasn\'t dead--he merely pretended, the\r\ncoward!"\r\n\r\nLejeune took a quick drink, threw a sidelong glance at Lane\'s bloody\r\nform, and walked slowly back to the control room. Rogers followed. The\r\nclicking of their heels made a sullen echo upon the blistered walls.\r\n\r\nOn the screen, something dim and remote was moving, growing in size.\r\nRogers hastened forward in amazement.\r\n\r\n"It\'s Geitz!" he breathed. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
"Lord--he was too late--he\'s falling back!"\r\n\r\n"A pity," said Lejeune. "He has so much longer to wait now. It must be\r\nhorrible."\r\n\r\n"And the cylinder," Rogers sighed. "All that information will be lost."\r\nHis tired, bloodshot eyes followed the little capsule\'s course across\r\nthe screen, back toward the flaming sun.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps," remarked Lejeune, "there will be another expedition to\r\nMercury some day, another group of scientists, with a better ship and\r\nbetter equipment. And no meteorite will prevent their safe return to\r\nearth." He hesitated, took two tumblers from a nearby cabinet and\r\nfilled them with the remaining contents of his bottle. He handed one of\r\nthem to Rogers, took the other himself. "A final toast, Captain?"\r\n\r\nRogers accepted. "To the next Mercurian expedition, Lejeune."\r\n\r\n"The next expedition, Captain Rogers."\r\n\r\nThey drank, and Lejeune sucked in a breath. "I say--it\'s getting a bit\r\nwarm in here, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
