J. Rice\r\n\r\n                Lowndes didn\'t like Nestor. For Nestor\r\n            was a robot--managing his finances. And Nestor\r\n            had only one thought in his brain: save money!\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Imagination Stories of Science and Fantasy\r\n                             October 1958\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old robot was one of the few remaining hand-made productions of\r\nthe Rotulian era--an era which had seen each individually constructed\r\nrobot reach the zenith in the various professional fields. An era\r\ntotally unlike present-day Cornusia and its slip-shod electro-assembly\r\nline robotic productions. And indeed slip-shod were these productions,\r\nmany Cornusians agreed. Loudly and indignantly they howled that the\r\nstupid Cornusian robots, conspicuous by their dress (multicolored sport\r\ncoats, striped trousers, curling shoes and brightly feathered hats) did\r\nnothing but prance around all day and engage in horseplay.\r\n\r\nNot so the old robot....\r\n\r\nFrom that long-ago day when his final bolts had been lovingly tightened\r\nby grimy machinists and tabac-chewing electronicians, he had been\r\nfabulous. Even the Rotulian elders, accustomed as they were to robotic\r\nachievements, had been stunned by his rapid rise in the fields of\r\nfinance and economics. And even the irascible bearded banker, Tesmit\r\nLowndes, after an eighty year association with the robot in investment\r\ncircles, would admit, although grudgingly if questioned, that the robot\r\nwas "sharp with a kredit."\r\n\r\nUpon the early demise of the elder Lowndes (at age ninety, and there\r\nwere raised eyebrows in Cornusian society at such an early departure)\r\nhis will, officially striped in red and green and properly opened\r\nin the presence of the required seven witnesses was found to state\r\nunequivocally: "It is my last testament, under the laws of Cornusia,\r\nthat my longtime and good friend Nestor shall operate the finances\r\nof my estate for my son Harry, sole survivor, until...." And there\r\nfollowed, set down in tiny multitudinous lines of legal terminology\r\npeculiar to the age, the conditions and the length of the operation of\r\nthe estate.\r\n\r\nSo it was that the robot Nestor became involved, through no fault of\r\nhis own, with certain people who--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Nestor," said Harry Lowndes to the robot who had entered the study\r\nin answer to the pull on the bell cord, "I must have an advance on my\r\nallowance."\r\n\r\nNestor stopped just inside the door. He was a small and chunky robot,\r\nmuch older than the slender six-tube types presently in use. His somber\r\nclothing, unlike the gaily clad, stupid Cornusian robots, gave evidence\r\nthat he was a production of the Rotulian era. A blue-serge suit decked\r\nhis blocky metal frame. A conservative black and white zebraic tie,\r\na type popular with professional men, was knotted neatly into his\r\nspotlessly white button-down collar and draped in graceful folds over\r\nhis aud screen. Thick, horn-rimmed focals perched on his stub nose and\r\nmagnified his magenta eye sockets.\r\n\r\nHe was carrying two bulky ledgers, a huge well-worn legal-looking\r\nvolume and half a dozen much-thumbed copies of the Uni-Worlds Financial\r\nJournal. As Lowndes finished speaking Nestor shuffled toward the desk,\r\nset the armload down and stepped back, removing his black bowler and\r\nexposing to Lowndes\' view a worn, blue-gray pate from which tiny specks\r\nof aconium flaked--a sign of rapid aging in the Rotulian robot.\r\n\r\n"Master Lowndes," said Nestor, "an advance will be impossible.\r\nAccording to the terms of your late father\'s will--"\r\n\r\nLowndes interrupted, red-faced. He slammed his fist down on the\r\ndesk top. "All right. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
All right, Nestor," he growled. "So my father\r\nleft you, his financial adviser, in charge of the estate. I\'m not\r\ncomplaining. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
You\'re making kredits. But can\'t you loosen up a little\r\nbit? All I need is a five hundred advance on next month\'s allowance."\r\n\r\nNestor leaned forward to place the black bowler on the corner of the\r\ndesk. "I\'m sorry, Master," he said, straightening back up slowly. "The\r\nwill allows you one thousand kredits."\r\n\r\n"I know what the will allows me," yelled Lowndes.\r\n\r\n"Master," said Nestor, "I am trying to preserve the estate. Your\r\ninterests are paramount with--"\r\n\r\n"Nestor, I\'ve got to have five hundred kredits!"\r\n\r\nThe robot did not answer. His aud lights flickered.\r\n\r\nLowndes cooled down. "Nestor," he asked, "can\'t you find a loophole in\r\nthe terms of the will?" He pointed to the legal-looking volume setting\r\non the desk. "How about digging through that?

=== Chunk 4 ===
"\r\n\r\nNestor did not answer. His aud lights still flickered fitfully.\r\n\r\n"Nestor, I am sorry I spoke shortly to you."\r\n\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\nLowndes stared at the motionless robot. "Now look here Nestor, you\r\nheard me apologize."\r\n\r\nStill silence.\r\n\r\n"Please, Nestor," Lowndes pleaded. "I know you can figure out a way.\r\nJust this once. Please Nestor."\r\n\r\nSuddenly Nestor\'s cranial lights lit up. His aud lights flashed on. He\r\nlooked like a Christmas tree. His relays began to click-clack. His aud\r\nbox hummed. He sounded like a swarm of bees.\r\n\r\nLowndes stared in amazement. Nestor\'s deep thought processes never\r\nfailed to fascinate him. As he watched, abruptly all the lights cut\r\nout. The relays gave a final "clack." For a minute there was silence.\r\nThen Nestor spoke: "Master, I have converted a majority of the\r\nholdings ... yet five hundred cash kredits remain in Central National\r\nRepository. Under provisions of section four, paragraph seven,\r\nsub-paragraph eighteen of the Quarto Code, this amount could be carried\r\nto the ledgers as a gift to you, deductible. Your signature would not\r\nbe required for the cash transfer."\r\n\r\nLowndes eyes gleamed. "I\'m proud of you, Nestor. How long will it take\r\nto get the kredits?"\r\n\r\n"Master, as I mentioned, I have converted all but--"\r\n\r\n"For pete\'s sake Nestor, I\'ve got to have those kredits by seven\r\ntonight!"\r\n\r\n"Master, please! Allow me to explain the disposition of the converted\r\nassets. I am certain that we are facing a recession comparable to that\r\nsuffered by the ancients in the twenty-ninth year of the twentieth\r\ncentury. Therefore, I have withdrawn--"\r\n\r\nAgain Lowndes broke in. "Look, Nestor, tell me later. Let\'s get the\r\nfive hundred!"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps we should reconsider, Master. Even though legal, this action\r\nis irregular."\r\n\r\n"Reconsider! Whadya mean, reconsider! You figured it out, didn\'t you?\r\nNestor, someday you\'ll blow your tubes from worry. Now how about\r\ngetting those kredits!

=== Chunk 5 ===
"\r\n\r\n"All right, Master. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
I shall go." The robot shuffled from the study, his\r\ntempite joints creaking with age.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLowndes stared after him. So Nestor was converting assets, he thought.\r\nHe\'d bet a herd of two-headed Venusian horses that the robot would\r\nmore than quadruple any investment. He\'d probably buy into some\r\nnew uni-space enterprise. Even though it rankled to have the robot\r\ncontrolling the finances, still he had to admit that old Nestor was a\r\nfinancial wizard. Under the terms of the will of the departed elder\r\nLowndes, Nestor was to control the estate investments until Harry\r\nreached the age of thirty--or until Nestor ceased operating. And in\r\nthe meantime, though it was at times galling to have to live on the\r\nallowance--Harry termed it a dole--of one thousand kredits a month, he\r\nconsoled himself by reflecting that Nestor couldn\'t possibly last much\r\nlonger--he\'d already had several major overhauls. Besides, he, Harry,\r\nwould be thirty in three more years. Anyway, Nestor wasn\'t too hard\r\nto get along with. He was just too conscientious. But he _was_ making\r\nkredits by the barrelful. Harry thought, I\'ve been pretty lucky talking\r\nNestor out of the five hundred. Maybe I\'ve found the secret of handling\r\nhim. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Anyway, I\'d better watch myself. If I couldn\'t pay Sliman, I\'d\r\nreally be in the soup. At the thought of Sliman, he scowled. Too bad I\r\ncan\'t take Nestor down there and clean out that sharp-suited gambler.\r\nToo bad the law forbids calculators like Nestor to enter establishments\r\nsuch as Sliman\'s Snake Eyes Club. Wow! What Nestor wouldn\'t do to\r\nSliman\'s roulette wheel. And as for the dice game--! Well, he\'d pay\r\nSliman the five hundred and that\'d be all! He was through!! From now on\r\nhe\'d better devote his time to Judy. Of course, he reflected, she was a\r\ntrifle expensive for his one thousand kredit allowance, always wanting\r\njewelry and those cute Martian minks, but--His thoughts shifted. She\'ll\r\nbe plenty burned, he thought, because I didn\'t show up at the Krinkled\r\nWorlds Club last night. I should never have stopped in at Sliman\'s when\r\nI had a date with her. Apologies are definitely in order. I\'d better\r\ntalk to her and get out of the dog--\r\n\r\nThe video-screen hanging on the wall shrilled. He got up from the desk,\r\nwalked over to press the "On" switch.\r\n\r\nThe head and shoulders of an attractive female appeared on the screen.\r\nHer shoulder length auburn hair framed a face dominated by green eyes\r\nand sulky red lips.\r\n\r\n"Judy," said Lowndes enthusiastically, "I was just thinking of you."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t \'Judy\' me, you beast," she flung back at him.\r\n\r\n"Why, sweets, what\'s wrong?" he asked innocently.\r\n\r\n"You know well enough what\'s wrong," she flared. "I waited for you\r\nat the Club last night. But you never showed!" Her temper, clued by\r\nher auburn hair, was showing. "And I waited for my birthday present!\r\nBut I suppose it never occurred to you"--she stressed the _you_\r\nnastily--"that last evening was _also_ my birthday!"\r\n\r\n"Sweets, I\'m sorry." He sidled away from the green eyes glaring at him\r\nand added, "I\'ll see you tonight at eight-thirty."\r\n\r\nShe snorted. Then, noticing his furtive movement away from her she\r\nyelled, "Harry Lowndes, you come right back here in front of this\r\nscreen where I can see you. I want to know where you were last night!"\r\n\r\nHe came back, a sheepish grin spread over his face. "I stopped in at\r\nSliman\'s," he said.\r\n\r\nHer carmined lips tightened. "Sliman\'s! All right, Harry Lowndes, how\r\nmuch did you lose?"\r\n\r\n"Five hundred."\r\n\r\nHer green eyes flashed. "Lost five hundred!" she screamed. "That five\r\nhundred would have bought me a birthday present!" Her voice dropped\r\nseveral octaves. "I\'m through, Harry. I\'m sending your ring back in the\r\nmorning."\r\n\r\nHe was shaken. "Sweets, it\'ll never happen again. I\'m paying Sliman\r\noff tonight and, believe me, sweets it is the last time."\r\n\r\n"I mean it, Harry.

=== Chunk 8 ===
"\r\n\r\nHe groaned. "Judy, please! What of our plans?"\r\n\r\n"Plans! Did you think I\'d marry you on a pitiful one thousand kredits a\r\nmonth?"\r\n\r\nHe was desperate. "Judy, you can\'t do this. I\'ll speak to Nestor. I\'ll\r\nget him to increase the allowance."\r\n\r\nShe laughed at him, biting, sarcastic laughter. "Speak to Nestor! You\r\ncouldn\'t get Nestor to do anything. He controls _your_ estate. Or\r\ndidn\'t you know?"\r\n\r\n"Judy, please listen. I will--"\r\n\r\n"Good-bye Harry. Your ring will--"\r\n\r\nHe tried desperately to hold her on the screen, cutting in with, "Judy,\r\nit will be only a year or two until Nestor quits operating. Then we\r\nwill have the estate."\r\n\r\nShe was furious. Her anger, smouldering till now, erupted white-hot.\r\n"_You actually expect me to wait for that senile walking adding machine\r\nto run down?_" She was raging now, whiplashing him with abuse. "Why,\r\nyou spineless worm! You cheap excuse for a man! If you were half the\r\nman you pretend to be, you\'d _make_ that stupid robot quit operating!\r\nGood-bye!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe impact of her words had stunned him. He walked to the desk, slumped\r\nlimply, held his head in his hands. Unseeing he stared at the ledgers,\r\nthe much-thumbed journals. His eyes were bleak. Even now, still\r\nreeling under her scorn and smarting under her abuse, he thought of\r\nher. Recalled his last glimpse of her, auburn-haired and red-lipped.\r\nFlinched at the memory of her green eyes, glittering with rage, boring\r\ninto him.\r\n\r\nHe groaned, ran his hands through his dark hair, then rose. His face\r\nwas grim. He walked to the garage, rummaged in the trunk of the little\r\nground scooter, pulled out the three pronged ironite wheel wrench. He\r\ncarried it back to the study, laid it beside the desk and sat down to\r\nwait for Nestor....\r\n\r\nThe old robot shuffled into the study, his diaphragm tubes pulsing\r\nunder the strain of the four square trip to Central National. He\r\npulled a thick roll of orange colored kredits from the pocket of his\r\nblue-serge coat, and handed it to Lowndes. "There you are, Master," he\r\nwheezed.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Nestor," Lowndes replied. He walked toward the study\r\nwindows, glanced out into the sunlighted patio, then turned back to\r\nface the robot. "Nestor," he said, "a problem has come up. Do you\r\nthink it could be possible to increase the allowance. You see, I am\r\nplanning marriage."\r\n\r\nNestor\'s magenta eye sockets flickered slightly after Lowndes had\r\nfinished speaking. "Might I offer a suggestion, Master?" 

=== Chunk 9 ===
he asked.\r\n\r\n"Go ahead."\r\n\r\n"Master, it is rumored in the city that you have been frequenting the\r\nestablishment of Sliman, the gambler."\r\n\r\nLowndes glared at the robot. "Whadya talking about? What\'s Sliman\r\ngot do with all this? I asked you if you couldn\'t work out a liberal\r\nincrease. I want to get married!"\r\n\r\n"I have an answer for you, Master. But I thought it politic to mention\r\nthat the odds at Sliman\'s are definitely against you."\r\n\r\n"Forget about Sliman!" snarled Lowndes. "How about the increase?"\r\n\r\nThe robot\'s words thudded into Lowndes brain. "An increase is\r\nimpossible. Master!" 

=== Chunk 10 ===
he said. He went on, his aud tones crackling,\r\n"Indeed, I may have already overstepped in gifting you the five\r\nhundred kredits. The testament and tort attorneys may never allow it,\r\nespecially since it was in payment of a gambling debt! Good day!"\r\nNestor reached for the black bowler he had placed on the desk and set\r\nit neatly in the center of his worn pate. He picked up the armload\r\nof books and journals, and headed for the door. He turned back for a\r\nmoment to face Lowndes and add "And Master, if you will forgive my\r\nimpertinence, I should like to say that I do not believe a marriage\r\nwith Miss Judy would be prudent."\r\n\r\nIn that moment Lowndes\' face turned livid with anger. Seizing the heavy\r\nwheel wrench, he lunged for the blue-clad robot. He brought the wrench\r\ndown squarely in the center of the black bowler.\r\n\r\nSSSSSSSSSSS ... SSSSSSTTTTT ... CRACKLE ... SSSSSSTTTT....\r\n\r\nThe heavy pronged ironite wrench crashed into Nestor\'s cranial tubes,\r\ndrove through the blue-gray worn pate, sliced into the fragile\r\nold-style gretile metal, battered and shredded the robot\'s upper works\r\ninto a twisted mass.\r\n\r\nAgain and again, in maniacal fury Lowndes slammed the ironite prongs\r\ndown. Nestor crashed to the floor in a final hiss and crackle.\r\n\r\nLowndes stared at the robot\'s smashed remains, stared at blue-gray\r\nold-fashioned gretile metal scattered in a twisted heap of powdered\r\ntubes, shredded relays and curling tensit wires. Off to one side the\r\nledgers lay where they had fallen. He reached out and picked up one\r\nof them. He thumbed through the pages, ran his eyes over the lists of\r\nholdings set down in Nestor\'s precise hand. What was this? The page\r\ntitled Central National showed withdrawals. Where was the balance? His\r\neye riveted on the final figure.... Zero! He threw the ledger down,\r\nreached hurriedly for the other. Hah! here were further listings.\r\nHe flipped rapidly through page after page, intent on the balance.\r\nPage after page--One-World Banking--Coxcomb Trust--Martian Financial\r\nInstitute--Venusian Investors--Cornusian Tex Fund--But--But what was\r\nthis? All showed withdrawals. All showed balance Zero!\r\n\r\nBALANCE ZERO!\r\n\r\nHe sagged against the corner of the desk, his face pale. His hands\r\nshook. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
Where were the kredits? What had Nestor done with them? Sweat\r\nbroke out on his forehead. Steady, Steady--he dragged himself back from\r\npanic. His mind worked. 

=== Chunk 12 ===
Let\'s see. Central National is the biggest of\r\nthe repositories; Nestor held the working capital down there. If he\r\nconverted the kredits, they\'d know. He\'d tell them; he\'s dealt with\r\nthem for over eighty years. I\'d better go down and find out. I\'ll tell\r\nthem.... He was busy, his mind churning and twisting, concocting a\r\nstory....\r\n\r\nHe felt much better as he walked toward the study door. Thoughts\r\nintent on Judy, green-eyed, red-lipped, curvaceous Judy, and on the\r\nkredits certain to be invested somewhere in the maze of holdings, he\r\nstepped over the pile of smashed tubes, twisted relays and scorched\r\ntensit wires that had been Nestor. He eyed the pile. Nestor, he\r\nreflected, has met with an unavoidable accident. An accident,\r\ncoincident with a tube failure on Nestor\'s part, whereby the ground\r\nscooter broke its electronic control and ran over the robot. And in the\r\nsame line of thought ... I shall have to drag him over and stack him in\r\nfront of the garage and use the wheel wrench on the fenders and head\r\nlamps of the scooter. They shall have to be battered to show that....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe was smiling as he started for the big, eight-sided structure,\r\nCentral National.... A four square trip, and one which Nestor had made\r\nearlier in the day....\r\n\r\nVice-president Milligan, a thin, narrow-shouldered man who affected a\r\npince-nez greeted Lowndes. He offered a cool hand: "Mr. Lowndes, this\r\nis indeed a pleasure. We don\'t see you down here very often. 

=== Chunk 13 ===
Have a\r\nseat."\r\n\r\n"No, not very often," said Harry, dropping the hand and sitting down,\r\n"Nestor handles the accounts."\r\n\r\n"Well, Mr. Lowndes, what can we do for you?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Milligan, Nestor has suddenly blown a tube and has decided to turn\r\nin for an overhaul."\r\n\r\n"Sorry to hear that. These tube failures can be so sudden. Matter of\r\nfact, I believe I saw Nestor in our investment department an hour or so\r\nago."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right, he was," said Lowndes. "But after the tube blew, he\r\nbecame very concerned as to whether the balance he showed in the\r\nledgers was correct." Lowndes smiled, "I told him I\'d find out, Mr.\r\nMilligan. Sort of humor him, y\'know."\r\n\r\nMilligan rose, pulled his pince-nez out of his suit pocket and placed\r\nit squarely on the tip of his nose. He looked over at Lowndes and said,\r\n"Mr. Lowndes, you are fortunate to have Nestor handle the financial\r\naffairs for the estate. Your father showed exceptional judgment in the\r\nselection. Naturally, we at Central National were elated--why, we\'ve\r\nheld your family\'s finances and dealt through Nestor for over eighty\r\nyears. In fact, ever since your father organized Lowndes Methodical\r\nInvestments." Milligan started for the door, "Now," he said, "if you\'ll\r\nexcuse me, I\'ll go and check on the accounts balance."\r\n\r\nHe came back frowning. He removed the pince-nez from his nose and held\r\nit in his hand. He appeared concerned. 

=== Chunk 14 ===
"Mr. Lowndes," he said, "Nestor\r\nhas closed out the accounts. Every kredit has been withdrawn--not only\r\nhere, but in all our correspondent repositories." He paced back and\r\nforth in front of Lowndes. He stopped, peered down and added, "A five\r\nhundred thousand withdrawal, Mr. Lowndes."\r\n\r\n"Five hundred thousand," repeated Harry. He reached for his\r\nhandkerchief. His forehead was beginning to bead with sweat.\r\n\r\n"We have explicit confidence in Nestor\'s ability, Mr. Lowndes\r\nbut--" Milligan looked sharply at Harry. "Are you sure he hasn\'t\r\nhad an unreported tube failure during the past few days? After all,\r\nwithdrawing five hundred thousand kredits--" he broke off.\r\n\r\n"Five hundred thousand kredits!" said Harry.\r\n\r\n"I agree with you, Mr. Lowndes. Indeed a sizable amount." Milligan\r\ngave a weak laugh. "Naturally," he continued, "we are loath to lose\r\nan account of this size. That is the reason I inquired as to possible\r\nfailure on Nestor\'s cranial range. His actions certainly have been\r\nstrange--"\r\n\r\nLowndes interrupted, "What? What\'s strange? He was all right this\r\nmorning."\r\n\r\nMilligan was agitated. "Are you sure, Mr. 

=== Chunk 15 ===
Lowndes? First of all, Nestor\r\ntold Farrell, our investment man that we Cornusians were headed for\r\na recession of even greater severity than that experienced by the\r\nancients in the twenty-ninth year of the twentieth century."\r\n\r\nLowndes\' hands were shaking. He fumbled for a Martian rolled plovur,\r\nlit it and inhaled the greenish fumes. "Why," he said, "Nestor told me\r\nthe same thing this morning. What does that prove?"\r\n\r\nMilligan stared at the greenish fumes with distaste. He did not smoke.\r\nHe said shortly, "Allow me to continue, M. Lowndes. I am as distressed\r\nby this affair as you are. After all, five hundred thousand kredits."\r\nHe broke off, eyed the green fumes curling from the tip of Lowndes\'\r\nplovur, then continued, "Frankly, Mr. Lowndes, I never heard of\r\nanything so fantastic."\r\n\r\nLowndes couldn\'t control his hands. He dropped the plovur on the\r\ncarpet. He stood. He couldn\'t control his shaking legs. He grasped the\r\nedge of Milligan\'s desk. "What-dya mean, you never heard of anything so\r\nfantastic?" he croaked weakly. "What\'d Nestor tell Farrell he was going\r\nto do with the kredits?"\r\n\r\nMilligan\'s face blanched. His voice in turn quavered. "What? 

=== Chunk 16 ===
You mean\r\n_you_ don\'t know? Why, Nestor told Farrell he was going to tell you--in\r\ncase an emergency came up. Farrell says Nestor walked out of here with\r\na great big grip jammed full of the kredits. Said he was going to\r\n_bury_ them. Said he\'d be back and redeposit them after the recession\r\nwas going good--when a kredit would be worth a kredit!"\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
