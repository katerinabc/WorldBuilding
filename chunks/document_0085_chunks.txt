So he\r\n             sat back in his chair and began to question--\r\n\r\n                      The Man Who Made The World\r\n\r\n                          By Richard Matheson\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Imagination Stories of Science and Fantasy\r\n                             February 1954\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Doctor Janishefsky sat in his office. Leaning back in a great leather\r\nchair, hands folded.

He had a reflective air and a well-trimmed goatee.\r\nHe hummed a few bars of--"It Ain\'t Whatcha Do, It\'s The Way Thatcha\r\nDo It." He broke off and looked up with a kindly smile as the nurse\r\nentered. Her name was Mudde._\r\n\r\nNURSE MUDDE. Doctor, there is a man in the waiting room who says he\r\nmade the world.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Oh?\r\n\r\nNURSE MUDDE. Shall I let him in?\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. By all means, Nurse Mudde. Show the man in.\r\n\r\n_Nurse Mudde left. A small man entered. He was five foot five wearing a\r\nsuit made for a man six foot five. His hands were near-hidden by the\r\nsleeve ends, his trouser leg bottoms creased sharply at the shoe tops,\r\nassuming the function of unattached spats. The shoes were virtually\r\ninvisible. As was the gentleman\'s mouth lurking behind a mustache of\r\nmouselike proportions._\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Won\'t you have a seat Mr....\r\n\r\nSMITH. Smith. (_He sits_)\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Now.\r\n\r\n(_They regard each other_)\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. My nurse tells me you made the world.\r\n\r\nSMITH. Yes. (_In a confessional tone_) I did.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. (_Settling back in his chair_) All of it?\r\n\r\nSMITH. Yes.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. And everything in it?\r\n\r\nSMITH. Take a little, give a little.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. You\'re sure of this?\r\n\r\nSMITH. (_With an expression that clearly says--I am telling the truth\r\nthe whole truth and nothing but the truth so help me._) Quite sure.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. (_Nods once_) When did you do this thing?\r\n\r\nSMITH. Five years ago.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. How old are you?\r\n\r\nSMITH. Forty-seven.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Where were you the other forty-two years?\r\n\r\nSMITH. I wasn\'t.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. You mean you started out....\r\n\r\nSMITH. Forty-two years old. That\'s correct.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. But the world is millions of years old.\r\n\r\nSMITH. (_Shaking his head_) No. It isn\'t.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. It\'s five years old.\r\n\r\nSMITH. That\'s correct.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. What about fossils? What about the age of rocks? Uranium into\r\nlead. What about diamonds?\r\n\r\nSMITH. (_Not to be bothered_) Illusions.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. You made them up.\r\n\r\nSMITH. That\'s....\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. (_Breaking in_) Why?\r\n\r\nSMITH. To see if I could.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. I don\'t....\r\n\r\nSMITH. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Anyone can make a world. It takes ingenuity to make one and then\r\nmake the people on it think that it\'s existed for millions of years.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. How long did all this take you?\r\n\r\nSMITH. Three and a half months. World time.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. What do you mean by that?\r\n\r\nSMITH. Before I made the world I lived beyond time.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Where\'s that?\r\n\r\nSMITH. No where.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. In the cosmos?\r\n\r\nSMITH. That\'s correct.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. You didn\'t like it there?\r\n\r\nSMITH. No. It was boring.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. And that\'s why....\r\n\r\nSMITH. I made the world.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Yes. But ... how did you make it?\r\n\r\nSMITH. I had books.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Books?\r\n\r\nSMITH. Instruction books.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Where did you get them?\r\n\r\nSMITH. I made them up.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. You mean you wrote them?\r\n\r\nSMITH. I ... made them up.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. How?\r\n\r\nSMITH. (_Mustache bristling truculently_) I made them up.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. (_Lips pursed_) So there you were out in the cosmos with a\r\nhandful of books.\r\n\r\nSMITH. That\'s correct.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. What if you had dropped them?\r\n\r\nSMITH. (_Chooses not to answer this patent absurdity_)\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Mister Smith.\r\n\r\nSMITH. Yes?\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Who made you?\r\n\r\nSMITH. (_Shakes his head_) I don\'t know.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Were you always like this? (_He points at Mr. Smith\'s lowly\r\nframe._)\r\n\r\nSMITH. I don\'t think so. I think that I was punished.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. For what?\r\n\r\nSMITH. For making the world so complicated.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. I should think so.\r\n\r\nSMITH. It\'s not my fault. I just made it, I didn\'t say it would work\r\nright.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. You just started your machine and then walked away.\r\n\r\nSMITH. That\'s....\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Then what are you doing here?\r\n\r\nSMITH. I told you. I think I\'ve been punished.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Oh yes. For making it too complicated. I forgot.\r\n\r\nSMITH. That\'s correct.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Who punished you?\r\n\r\nSMITH. I don\'t remember.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. That\'s convenient.\r\n\r\nSMITH. (_Looks morose_)\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Might it be God?\r\n\r\nSMITH. (_Shrugs_) It might.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. He might have a few fingers in the rest of the Universe.\r\n\r\nSMITH. He might. But I made the world.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Enough, Mr. Smith, you did not make the world.\r\n\r\nSMITH. (_Insulted_) Yes, I did too.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. And you created me?\r\n\r\nSMITH. (_Concedingly_) Indirectly.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Then uncreate me.\r\n\r\nSMITH. I can\'t.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Why?\r\n\r\nSMITH. I just started things. I don\'t control them now.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. (_Sighs_) Then what are you worried about, Mr. Smith?\r\n\r\nSMITH. I have a premonition.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. What about?\r\n\r\nSMITH. I\'m going to die.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. So...?\r\n\r\nSMITH. Someone has to take over. Or else.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Or else...?\r\n\r\nSMITH. The whole world will go.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Go where?\r\n\r\nSMITH. No where. Just disappear.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. How can it disappear if it works independently of you?\r\n\r\nSMITH. It will be taken away to punish me.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. You?\r\n\r\nSMITH. Yes.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. You mean if you die, the entire world will disappear?\r\n\r\nSMITH. That\'s correct.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. If I shot you, the instant you died I would disappear?\r\n\r\nSMITH. That\'s....\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. I have advice.\r\n\r\nSMITH. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Yes? You will help?\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Go to see a reputable psychiatrist.\r\n\r\nSMITH. (_Standing_) I should have known. I have no more to say.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. (_Shrugs_) As you will.\r\n\r\nSMITH. I\'ll go but you\'ll be sorry about this.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. I dare say you are already sorry, Mr. Smith.\r\n\r\nSMITH. Goodbye. (_Mr. Smith exits. Doctor Janishefsky calls for his\r\nnurse over the interphone. Nurse Mudde enters._)\r\n\r\nNURSE M. Yes, doctor?\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Nurse Mudde, stand by the window and tell me what you see.\r\n\r\nNURSE M. What I...?\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. What you see. I want you to tell me what Mr. Smith does after\r\nhe comes out of the building.\r\n\r\nNURSE M. (_Shrugs_) Yes, doctor. (_She goes to the window_)\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Has he come out yet?\r\n\r\nNURSE M. No.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Keep watching.\r\n\r\nNURSE M. There he is. He\'s stepping off the curb. He\'s walking across\r\nthe street.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Yes.\r\n\r\nNURSE M. He\'s stopping now in the middle of the street. He\'s turning.\r\nHe\'s looking up at this window. There\'s a look of ... of ...\r\n_realization_ on his face. He\'s coming back. (_She screams_) He\'s been\r\nhit by a car. He\'s lying on the street....\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. What is it, Nurse Mudde?\r\n\r\nNurse M. (_Reeling_) Everything is ... is _fading_! Doctor Janishefsky,\r\nit\'s fading! (_Another scream_)\r\n\r\nDOCTOR J. Don\'t be absurd, Nurse Mudde. Look at me. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Can you honestly\r\nsay that.... (_He stops talking. She cannot honestly say anything. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
She\r\nis not there. Doctor Janishefsky who is not really Doctor Janishefsky\r\nfloats alone in the cosmos in his chair which is not really a chair.\r\nHe looks at the chair beside him._) I hope you\'ve learned your lesson.\r\nI\'m going to put your toy back but don\'t you dare go near it. So you\'re\r\nbored are you? 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Scalliwag! You just behave yourself or I\'ll take away\r\nyour books too! (_He snorts_) So you made them up, did you? (He looks\r\naround). 

=== Chunk 8 ===
How about picking them up, jackanapes!\r\n\r\nSMITH. (_Who is not really Smith_) Yes, father.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
