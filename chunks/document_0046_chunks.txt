It does appear\r\n that way, doesn\'t it? It may not take\r\n so long for a spaceman to learn ..._\r\n\r\nBy JOHN CORY\r\n\r\nIllustrated by Gardner\r\n\r\n\r\nNear the end of his fifteenth orbit as Greenland slipped by noiselessly\r\nbelow, he made the routine measurements that tested the operation of his\r\nspace capsule and checked the automatic instruments which would transmit\r\ntheir stored data to Earth on his next pass over Control. Everything\r\nnormal; all mechanical devices were operating perfectly.\r\n\r\nThis information didn\'t surprise him, in fact, he really didn\'t even\r\nthink about it. The previous orbits and the long simulated flights on\r\nEarth during training had made such checks routine and perfect results\r\nexpected. The capsules were developed by exhaustive testing both on the\r\nground and as empty satellites before entrusting them to carry animals\r\nand then the first human.\r\n\r\nHe returned to contemplation of the panorama passing below and above,\r\nalthough as he noted idly, above and below had lost some of their usual\r\nmeaning. Since his capsule, like all heavenly bodies, was stable in\r\nposition with respect to the entire universe and, thanks to Sir Isaac\r\nNewton and his laws, never changed, the Earth and the stars alternated\r\nover his head during each orbit. "Up" now meant whatever was in the\r\ndirection of his head. He remembered that even during his initial orbit\r\nwhen the Earth first appeared overhead he accepted the fact as normal.\r\nHe wondered if the other two had accepted it as easily.\r\n\r\nFor there had been two men hurled into orbit before he ventured into\r\nspace. Two others who had also passed the rigorous three-year training\r\nperiod and were selected on the basis of over-all performance to precede\r\nhim.

He had known them both well and wondered again what had happened on\r\ntheir flights. Of course, they had both returned, depending upon what\r\nyour definition of return was. The capsules in which they had ventured\r\nbeyond Earth had returned them living. But this was to be expected, for\r\neven the considerable hazards of descent through the atmosphere and the\r\nterrible heating which occurred were successfully surmounted by the\r\ncapsule.\r\n\r\nNaturally, it had not been expected that the satellites would have to be\r\nbrought down by command from the ground. But this, too, was part of the\r\ncareful planning--radio control of the retro-rockets that move the\r\nsatellite out of orbit by reducing its velocity. Of course, ground\r\ncontrol was to be used only if the astronaut failed to ignite the\r\nretro-rockets himself. He remembered everyone\'s surprise and relief when\r\nthe first capsule was recovered and its occupant found to be alive. They\r\nhad assumed that in spite of all precautions he was dead because he had\r\nnot fired the rockets on the fiftieth orbit and it was necessary to\r\nbring him down on the sixty-fifth.\r\n\r\nRecovery alive only partially solved the mystery, for the rescuers and\r\nall others were met by a haughty, stony silence from the occupant.\r\nBatteries of tests confirmed an early diagnosis: complete and utter\r\nwithdrawal; absolute refusal to communicate. Therapy was unsuccessful.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe second attempt was similar in most respects, except that command\r\nreturn was made on the thirty-first orbit after the astronaut\'s failure\r\nto de-orbit at the end of the thirtieth. His incoherent babble of moons,\r\nstars, and worlds was no more helpful than the first.\r\n\r\nTest after test confirmed that no obvious organic damage had been\r\nincurred by exposure outside of the Earth\'s protective atmosphere.\r\nBiopsy of even selected brain tissues seemed to show that microscopic\r\ncellular changes due to prolonged weightlessness or primary cosmic-ray\r\nbombardment, which had been suggested by some authorities, were\r\nunimportant. Somewhat reluctantly, it was decided to repeat the\r\nexperiment a third time.\r\n\r\nThe launching was uneventful. He was sent into space with the precision\r\nhe expected. The experience was exhilarating and, although he had\r\nanticipated each event in advance, he could not possibly have foreseen\r\nthe overpowering feeling that came over him. Weightlessness he had\r\nexperienced for brief periods during training, but nothing could match\r\nthe heady impression of continuous freedom from gravity.\r\n\r\nEarth passing overhead was also to be expected from the simple laws of\r\ncelestial mechanics but his feeling as he watched it now was\r\ninexpressible. It occurred to him that perhaps this was indeed why he\r\nwas here, because he could appreciate such experiences best. He had been\r\ntold the stars would be bright, unblinking, and an infinitude in extent,\r\nbut could mere descriptions or photographs convey the true seeing?\r\n\r\nOn his twenty-first orbit he completed his overseeing the entire surface\r\nof the planet in daylight. He had seen more of Earth than anyone able to\r\ntell about it, but only he had the true feeling of it. The continents\r\nwere clearly visible, as were the oceans and both polar ice caps. The\r\nshapes were familiar but in only a remote way. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
A vague indistinctness\r\nborne of distance served to modify the outlines and he alone was seeing\r\nand understanding. On the dark side of the planet large cities were\r\nmarked by indistinct light areas which paled to insignificance compared\r\nto the stars and his sun.\r\n\r\nHe speculated about the others who had only briefly experienced these\r\nsights. Undoubtedly they weren\'t as capable of fully grasping or\r\nappreciating any of these things as he was. It was quite clear that no\r\none else but he could encompass the towering feeling of power and\r\nimportance generated by being alone in the Universe.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the twenty-fifth orbit he disabled the radio control of\r\nthe retro-rockets and sat back with satisfaction to await the next\r\ncircuit of his Earth around Him.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Astounding Science Fiction_ May 1960.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.
