SCHMITZ\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     He was already a thief, prepared to steal again. He didn't know\r\n     that he himself was only booty!\r\n\r\n\r\nPhil Garfield was thirty miles south of the little town of Redmon on\r\nRoute Twelve when he was startled by a series of sharp, clanking noises.\r\nThey came from under the Packard's hood.\r\n\r\nThe car immediately began to lose speed. Garfield jammed down the\r\naccelerator, had a sense of sick helplessness at the complete lack of\r\nresponse from the motor. The Packard rolled on, getting rid of its\r\nmomentum, and came to a stop.\r\n\r\nPhil Garfield swore shakily. He checked his watch, switched off the\r\nheadlights and climbed out into the dark road. A delay of even half an\r\nhour here might be disastrous. It was past midnight, and he had another\r\nhundred and ten miles to cover to reach the small private airfield where\r\nMadge waited for him and the thirty thousand dollars in the suitcase on\r\nthe Packard's front seat.\r\n\r\nIf he didn't make it before daylight....\r\n\r\nHe thought of the bank guard. The man had made a clumsy play at being a\r\nhero, and that had set off the fool woman who'd run screaming into their\r\nline of fire.

One dead.

Perhaps two. Garfield hadn't stopped to look at\r\nan evening paper.\r\n\r\nBut he knew they were hunting for him.\r\n\r\nHe glanced up and down the road. No other headlights in sight at the\r\nmoment, no light from a building showing on the forested hills. He\r\nreached back into the car and brought out the suitcase, his gun, a big\r\nflashlight and the box of shells which had been standing beside the\r\nsuitcase. He broke the box open, shoved a handful of shells and the .38\r\ninto his coat pocket, then took suitcase and flashlight over to the\r\nshoulder of the road and set them down.\r\n\r\nThere was no point in groping about under the Packard's hood. When it\r\ncame to mechanics, Phil Garfield was a moron and well aware of it. The\r\ncar was useless to him now ... except as bait.\r\n\r\nBut as bait it might be very useful.\r\n\r\nShould he leave it standing where it was? No, Garfield decided. To\r\nanybody driving past it would merely suggest a necking party, or a drunk\r\nsleeping off his load before continuing home. He might have to wait an\r\nhour or more before someone decided to stop. He didn't have the time. He\r\nreached in through the window, hauled the top of the steering wheel\r\ntowards him and put his weight against the rear window frame.\r\n\r\nThe Packard began to move slowly backwards at a slant across the road.\r\nIn a minute or two he had it in position. Not blocking the road\r\nentirely, which would arouse immediate suspicion, but angled across it,\r\nlights out, empty, both front doors open and inviting a passerby's\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nGarfield carried the suitcase and flashlight across the right-hand\r\nshoulder of the road and moved up among the trees and undergrowth of the\r\nslope above the shoulder. Placing the suitcase between the bushes, he\r\nbrought out the .38, clicked the safety off and stood waiting.\r\n\r\nSome ten minutes later, a set of headlights appeared speeding up Route\r\nTwelve from the direction of Redmon. Phil Garfield went down on one knee\r\nbefore he came within range of the lights. Now he was completely\r\nconcealed by the vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe car slowed as it approached, braking nearly to a stop sixty feet\r\nfrom the stalled Packard. There were several people inside it; Garfield\r\nheard voices, then a woman's loud laugh. The driver tapped his horn\r\ninquiringly twice, moved the car slowly forward. As the headlights went\r\npast him, Garfield got to his feet among the bushes, took a step down\r\ntowards the road, raising the gun.\r\n\r\nThen he caught the distant gleam of a second set of headlights\r\napproaching from Redmon. He swore under his breath and dropped back out\r\nof sight. The car below him reached the Packard, edged cautiously around\r\nit, rolled on with a sudden roar of acceleration.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe second car stopped when still a hundred yards away, the Packard\r\ncaught in the motionless glare of its lights. Garfield heard the steady\r\npurring of a powerful motor.\r\n\r\nFor almost a minute, nothing else happened. Then the car came gliding\r\nsmoothly on, stopped again no more than thirty feet to Garfield's left.\r\nHe could see it now through the screening bushes--a big job, a long, low\r\nfour-door sedan. The motor continued to purr. After a moment, a door on\r\nthe far side of the car opened and slammed shut.\r\n\r\nA man walked quickly out into the beam of the headlights and started\r\ntowards the Packard.\r\n\r\nPhil Garfield rose from his crouching position, the .38 in his right\r\nhand, flashlight in his left. If the driver was alone, the thing was now\r\ncinched! But if there was somebody else in the car, somebody capable of\r\nfast, decisive action, a slip in the next ten seconds might cost him the\r\nsedan, and quite probably his freedom and life. Garfield lined up the\r\n.38's sights steadily on the center of the approaching man's head. He\r\nlet his breath out slowly as the fellow came level with him in the road\r\nand squeezed off one shot.\r\n\r\nInstantly he went bounding down the slope to the road. The bullet had\r\nflung the man sideways to the pavement. Garfield darted past him to the\r\nleft, crossed the beam of the headlights, and was in darkness again on\r\nthe far side of the road, snapping on his flashlight as he sprinted up\r\nto the car.\r\n\r\nThe motor hummed quietly on. The flashlight showed the seats empty.\r\nGarfield dropped the light, jerked both doors open in turn, gun pointing\r\ninto the car's interior. Then he stood still for a moment, weak and\r\nalmost dizzy with relief.\r\n\r\nThere was no one inside. The sedan was his.\r\n\r\nThe man he had shot through the head lay face down on the road, his hat\r\nflung a dozen feet away from him. Route Twelve still stretched out in\r\ndark silence to east and west. There should be time enough to clean up\r\nthe job before anyone else came along. Garfield brought the suitcase\r\ndown and put it on the front seat of the sedan, then started back to get\r\nhis victim off the road and out of sight. He scaled the man's hat into\r\nthe bushes, bent down, grasped the ankles and started to haul him\r\ntowards the left side of the road where the ground dropped off sharply\r\nbeyond the shoulder.\r\n\r\nThe body made a high, squealing sound and began to writhe violently.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShocked, Garfield dropped the legs and hurriedly took the gun from his\r\npocket, moving back a step. The squealing noise rose in intensity as the\r\nwounded man quickly flopped over twice like a struggling fish, arms and\r\nlegs sawing about with startling energy. Garfield clicked off the\r\nsafety, pumped three shots into his victim's back.\r\n\r\nThe grisly squeals ended abruptly. The body continued to jerk for\r\nanother second or two, then lay still.\r\n\r\nGarfield shoved the gun back into his pocket. The unexpected\r\ninterruption had unnerved him; his hands shook as he reached down again\r\nfor the stranger's ankles. Then he jerked his hands back, and\r\nstraightened up, staring.\r\n\r\nFrom the side of the man's chest, a few inches below the right arm,\r\nsomething like a thick black stick, three feet long, protruded now\r\nthrough the material of the coat.\r\n\r\nIt shone, gleaming wetly, in the light from the car. Even in that first\r\nuncomprehending instant, something in its appearance brought a surge of\r\nsick disgust to Garfield's throat. Then the stick bent slowly halfway\r\ndown its length, forming a sharp angle, and its tip opened into what\r\ncould have been three blunt, black claws which scrabbled clumsily\r\nagainst the pavement. Very faintly, the squealing began again, and the\r\nbody's back arched up as if another sticklike arm were pushing\r\ndesperately against the ground beneath it.\r\n\r\nGarfield acted in a blur of horror. He emptied the .38 into the thing at\r\nhis feet almost without realizing he was doing it. Then, dropping the\r\ngun, he seized one of the ankles, ran backwards to the shoulder of the\r\nroad, dragging the body behind him.\r\n\r\nIn the darkness at the edge of the shoulder, he let go of it, stepped\r\naround to the other side and with two frantically savage kicks sent the\r\nbody plunging over the shoulder and down the steep slope beyond. He\r\nheard it crash through the bushes for some seconds, then stop. He\r\nturned, and ran back to the sedan, scooping up his gun as he went past.\r\nHe scrambled into the driver's seat and slammed the door shut behind\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHis hands shook violently on the steering wheel as he pressed down the\r\naccelerator. The motor roared into life and the big car surged forward.\r\nHe edged it past the Packard, cursing aloud in horrified shock, jammed\r\ndown the accelerator and went flashing up Route Twelve, darkness racing\r\nbeside and behind him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_What had it been?_ Something that wore what seemed to be a man's body\r\nlike a suit of clothes, moving the body as a man moves, driving a man's\r\ncar ... roach-armed, roach-legged itself!\r\n\r\nGarfield drew a long, shuddering breath. Then, as he slowed for a curve,\r\nthere was a spark of reddish light in the rear-view mirror.\r\n\r\nHe stared at the spark for an instant, braked the car to a stop, rolled\r\ndown the window and looked back.\r\n\r\nFar behind him along Route Twelve, a fire burned. Approximately at the\r\npoint where the Packard had stalled out, where something had gone\r\nrolling off the road into the bushes....\r\n\r\nSomething, Garfield added mentally, that found fiery automatic\r\ndestruction when death came to it, so that its secrets would remain\r\nunrevealed.\r\n\r\nBut for him the fire meant the end of a nightmare. He rolled the window\r\nup, took out a cigarette, lit it, and pressed the accelerator....\r\n\r\nIn incredulous fright, he felt the nose of the car tilt upwards,\r\nheadlights sweeping up from the road into the trees.\r\n\r\nThen the headlights winked out. Beyond the windshield, dark tree\r\nbranches floated down towards him, the night sky beyond. He reached\r\nfrantically for the door handle.\r\n\r\nA steel wrench clamped silently about each of his arms, drawing them in\r\nagainst his sides, immobilizing them there. Garfield gasped, looked up\r\nat the mirror and saw a pair of faintly gleaming red eyes watching him\r\nfrom the rear of the car. Two of the things ... the second one stood\r\nbehind him out of sight, holding him. They'd been in what had seemed to\r\nbe the trunk compartment.

And they had come out.\r\n\r\nThe eyes in the mirror vanished. A moist, black roach-arm reached over\r\nthe back of the seat beside Garfield, picked up the cigarette he had\r\ndropped, extinguished it with rather horribly human motions, then took\r\nup Garfield's gun and drew back out of sight.\r\n\r\nHe expected a shot, but none came.\r\n\r\nOne doesn't fire a bullet through the suit one intends to wear....\r\n\r\nIt wasn't until that thought occurred to him that tough Phil Garfield\r\nbegan to scream. He was still screaming minutes later when, beyond the\r\nwindshield, the spaceship floated into view among the stars.\r\n\r\nEND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Note:\r\n\r\nThis etext was produced from _Worlds of If_ January 1962.
