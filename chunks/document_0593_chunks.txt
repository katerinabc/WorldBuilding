"You _will_ come this time, won\'t you, Narli?"\r\n\r\nNarli Gzann rubbed his forehead fretfully. "You know how I feel about\r\nparties, Karn." He took a frismil nut out of the tray on his desk and\r\nnibbled it in annoyance.\r\n\r\n"But this is in your honor, Narli--a farewell party. You must go. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
It\r\nwould be--it would be unthinkable if you didn\'t." Karn Slood\'s eyes were\r\npleading. He could not possibly be held responsible for his friend\'s\r\nanti-social behavior and yet, Narli knew, he would somehow feel at\r\nfault.\r\n\r\nNarli sighed. He supposed he would have to conform to public sentiment\r\nin this particular instance, but he was damned if he would give in\r\ngracefully. "After all, what\'s so special about the occasion? I\'m just\r\nleaving to take another teaching job, that\'s all." He took another nut.\r\n\r\n"That\'s _all_!" Slood\'s face swelled with emotion. "You can\'t really be\r\nthat indifferent."\r\n\r\n"Another job, that\'s all it is to me," Narli persisted. "At an\r\nexceptionally high salary, of course, or I wouldn\'t dream of accepting a\r\nposition so inconveniently located."\r\n\r\nSlood was baffled and hurt and outraged. "You have been honored by being\r\nthe first of our people to be offered an exchange professorship on\r\nanother planet," he said stiffly, "and you call it \'just another job.\'\r\nWhy, I would have given my right antenna to get it!"\r\n\r\nNarli realized that he had again overstepped the invisible boundary\r\nbetween candor and tactlessness. He poked at the nuts with a stylus.\r\n\r\n"Honored by being the first of our species to be offered a\r\nguinea-pigship," he murmured.\r\n\r\nHe had not considered this aspect of the matter before, but now that it\r\noccurred to him, he was probably right.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t mind, really." He waved away the other\'s sudden\r\ncommiseration. "You know I like being alone most of the time, so I won\'t\r\nfind that uncomfortable. Students are students, whether they\'re\r\nTerrestrials or Saturnians. I suppose they\'ll laugh at me behind my\r\nback, but then even here, my students always did that."\r\n\r\nHe gave a hollow laugh and unobtrusively put out one of his hands for a\r\nnut. "At least on Earth I\'ll know why they\'re laughing."\r\n\r\nThere was pain on Slood\'s expressive face as he firmly removed the nut\r\ntray from his friend\'s reach. "I didn\'t think of it from that angle,\r\nNarli. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Of course you\'re right. Human beings, from what I\'ve read of\r\nthem, are not noted for tolerance. It will be difficult, but I\'m sure\r\nyou\'ll be able to--" he choked on the kindly lie--"win them over."\r\n\r\nNarli repressed a bitter laugh. Anyone less likely than he to win over a\r\nhostile alien species through sheer personal charm could hardly be found\r\non Saturn. Narli Gzann had been chosen as first exchange professor\r\nbetween Saturn and Earth because of his academic reputation, not his\r\npersonality. But although the choosers had probably not had that aspect\r\nof the matter in mind, the choice, he thought, was a wise one.\r\n\r\nAs an individual of solitary habits, he was not apt to be much lonelier\r\non one planet than another.\r\n\r\nAnd he had accepted the post largely because he felt that, as an alien\r\nbeing, he would be left strictly alone. This would give him the chance\r\nto put in a lot of work on his definitive history of the Solar System, a\r\nmonumental project from which he begrudged all the time he had to spend\r\nin fulfilling even the minimum obligations expected of a professor on\r\nsociable Saturn.\r\n\r\nThe salary was a weighty factor, too--not only was it more than twice\r\nwhat he had been getting, but since there would be no necessity for\r\nspending more than enough for bare subsistence he would be able to save\r\nup a considerable amount and retire while still comparatively young. It\r\nwas pleasant to imagine a scholarly life unafflicted by students.\r\n\r\nHe could put up with a good deal for that goal.\r\n\r\nBut how could he alleviate the distress he saw on Karn\'s face? He did\r\nnot consciously want to hurt the only person who, for some strange\r\nreason, seemed to be fond of him, so he said the only thing he could\r\nthink of to please: "All right, Karn, I\'ll go to the Perzils tomorrow\r\nnight."\r\n\r\nIt would be a deadly bore--parties always were--and he would eat too\r\nmuch, but, after all, the thought that it would be a long time before\r\nhe\'d ever see any of his own kind again would make the affair almost\r\nendurable. And just this once it would be all right for him to eat as\r\nmuch as he wanted. When he was on Earth out of reach of decent food, he\r\nwould probably trim down considerably.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"I just _know_ you\'re going to love Earth, Professor Gzann," the hostess\r\non the interplanetary liner gushed.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure I shall," he lied politely. She smiled at him too much,\r\nover-doing her professional cordiality; underneath the effusiveness, he\r\nsensed the repulsion. Of course he couldn\'t blame her for trying not to\r\nshow her distaste for the strange creature--the effort at concealment\r\nwas, as a matter of fact, more than he had expected from a Terrestrial.\r\nBut he wished she would leave him alone to meditate. He had planned to\r\nget a lot of meditation done on the journey.\r\n\r\n"You speak awfully good English," she told him.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her. "I am said to have some scholarly aptitude. I\r\nunderstand that\'s why I was chosen as an exchange professor. It does\r\nseem reasonable, doesn\'t it?"\r\n\r\nShe turned pink--a sign of embarrassment with these creatures, he had\r\nlearned. "I didn\'t mean to--to question your ability, Professor. It\'s\r\njust that--well, you don\'t look like a professor."\r\n\r\n"Indeed?" he said frostily. "And what do I look like, then?"\r\n\r\nShe turned even rosier. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
"Oh--I--I don\'t know exactly. It\'s just\r\nthat--well...." And she fled.\r\n\r\nHe couldn\'t resist flicking his antennae forward to catch her _sotto\r\nvoce_ conversation with the co-pilot; it was so seldom you got the\r\nchance to learn what others were saying about you behind your back. "But\r\nI could hardly tell him he looks like a teddy bear, could I?"\r\n\r\n"He probably doesn\'t even know what a teddy bear is."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I don\'t," Narli thought resentfully, "but I can guess."\r\n\r\nWith low cunning, the Terrestrials seemed to have ferreted out the\r\nidentity of all his favorite dishes and kept serving them to him\r\nincessantly. By the time the ship made planetfall on Earth, he had\r\ngained ten grisbuts.\r\n\r\n"Oh, well," he thought, "I suppose it\'s all just part of the regular\r\ndiplomatic service. On Earth, I\'ll have to eat crude native foods, so\r\nI\'ll lose all the weight again."\r\n\r\nPresident Purrington of North America came himself to meet Narli at the\r\nairfield because Narli was the first interplanetary exchange professor\r\nin history.\r\n\r\n"Welcome to our planet, Professor Gzann," he said with warm diplomatic\r\ncordiality, wringing Narli\'s upper right hand after a moment of\r\nindecision. "We shall do everything in our power to make your stay here\r\na happy and memorable one."\r\n\r\n"I wish you would begin by doing something about the climate," Narli\r\nthought. It was stupid of him not to have realized how hot it would be\r\non Earth. He was really going to suffer in this torrid climate;\r\nespecially in the tight Terrestrial costume he wore over his fur for the\r\nsake of conformity. Of course, justice compelled him to admit to\r\nhimself, the clothes wouldn\'t have become so snug if he hadn\'t eaten\r\nquite so much on board ship.\r\n\r\nPurrington indicated the female beside him. "May I introduce my wife?"\r\n\r\n"Ohhh," the female gasped, "isn\'t he _cute_!"\r\n\r\nThe President and Narli stared at her in consternation. She looked\r\nabashed for a moment, then smiled widely at Narli and the press\r\nphotographers.\r\n\r\n"Welcome to Earth, dear Professor Gzann!" she exclaimed, mispronouncing\r\nhis name, of course. Bending down, she kissed him right upon his fuzzy\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\nKissing was not a Saturnian practice, nor did Narli approve of it;\r\nhowever, he had read enough about Earth to know that Europeans sometimes\r\ngreeted dignitaries in this peculiar way. Only this place, he had been\r\ngiven to understand, was not Europe but America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"I am having a cocktail party in your honor this afternoon!" she beamed,\r\nsmoothing her flowered print dress down over her girdle. "You\'ll be\r\nthere at five sharp, won\'t you, dear?"\r\n\r\n"Delighted," he promised dismally. He could hardly plead a previous\r\nengagement a moment after arriving.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve tried to get all the things you like to eat," she went on\r\nanxiously, "but you will tell me if there\'s anything special, won\'t\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"I am on a diet," he said. He must be strong. Probably the food would be\r\nrepulsive anyhow, so he\'d have no difficulty controlling his appetite.\r\n"Digestive disorders, you know. A glass of Vichy and a biscuit will\r\nbe...."\r\n\r\nHe stopped, for there were tears in Mrs. Purrington\'s eyes. "Your tummy\r\nhurts? Oh, you poor little darling!"\r\n\r\n"Gladys!" the President said sharply.\r\n\r\nThere were frismil nuts at Mrs. Purrington\'s cocktail party and vilbar\r\nand even slipnis broogs ... all imported at fabulous expense, Narli\r\nknew, but then this was a government affair and expense means nothing to\r\na government since, as far as it is concerned, money grows on taxpayers.\r\nSome of the native foods proved surprisingly palatable, too--p\xc3\xa2t\xc3\xa9 de\r\nfoie gras and champagne and little puff pastries full of delightful\r\nsurprises. Narli was afraid he was making a zloogle of himself. However,\r\nhe thought, trying not to catch sight of his own portly person in the\r\nmirrors that walled the room, the lean days were just ahead.\r\n\r\nBesides, what could he do when everyone insisted on pressing food on\r\nhim? "Try this, Professor Gzann." "Do try that, Professor Gzann."\r\n("Doesn\'t he look cunning in his little dress suit?") They crowded\r\naround him. The women cooed, the men beamed, and Narli ate. He would be\r\nglad when he could detach himself from all this cloying diplomacy and\r\nget back to the healthy rancor of the classroom.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt school, the odor of chalk dust, ink and rotting apple cores was\r\nenough like its Saturnian equivalent to make Narli feel at home\r\nimmediately. The students would dislike him on sight, he knew. It is in\r\nthe nature of the young to be hostile toward whatever is strange and\r\nalien. They would despise him and jeer at him, and he, in his turn,\r\nwould give them long, involved homework assignments and such difficult\r\nexaminations that they would fail....\r\n\r\nNarli waddled briskly up to his desk which had, he saw, been scaled down\r\nto Saturnian size, whereas he had envisioned himself struggling\r\ntriumphantly with ordinary Earth-sized, furniture. But the atmosphere\r\nwas as hot and sticky and intolerable as he had expected. Panting as\r\nunobtrusively as possible, he rapped with his pointer. "Attention,\r\nstudents!"\r\n\r\nNow should come the derisive babble ... but there was a respectful\r\nsilence, broken suddenly by a shrill feminine whisper of, "Oooo, he\'s so\r\nadorable!" followed by the harsh, "Shhh, Ava! You\'ll embarrass the poor\r\nlittle thing.

=== Chunk 6 ===
"\r\n\r\nNarli\'s face swelled. "I am your new professor of Saturnian Studies.\r\nSaturn, as you probably know, is a major planet. It is much larger and\r\nmore important than Earth, which is only a minor planet."\r\n\r\nThe students obediently took this down in their notebooks. They\r\ncarefully took down everything he said. Even a bout of coughing that\r\nafflicted him half-way through seemed to be getting a phonetic\r\ntranscription. From time to time, they would interrupt his lecture with\r\nquestions so pertinent, so well-thought out and so courteous that all he\r\ncould do was answer them.\r\n\r\nHis antennae lifted to catch the whispers that from time to time were\r\nexchanged between even the best-behaved of the students. "Isn\'t he\r\nprecious?" "Seems like a nice fellow--sound grasp of his subject."\r\n"Sweet little thing!" "Unusually interesting presentation." "Doesn\'t he\r\nremind you of Winnie the Pooh?" "Able chap." 

=== Chunk 7 ===
"Just darling!"\r\n\r\nAfter class, instead of rushing out of the room, they hovered around his\r\ndesk with intelligent, solicitous questions. Did he like Earth? Was his\r\ndesk too high? Too low? Didn\'t he find it hot with all that fur? Such\r\nlovely, soft, fluffy fur, though. "Do you mind if I stroke one of your\r\npaws--_hands_--Professor?" ("So cuddly-looking!")\r\n\r\nHe said yes, as a matter of fact, he was hot, and no, he didn\'t mind\r\nbeing touched in a spirit of scientific investigation.\r\n\r\nHe had a moment of uplift at the teachers\' cafeteria when he discovered\r\nlunch to be virtually inedible. The manager, however, had been\r\ndistressed to see him pick at his food, and by dinner-time a\r\ndistinguished chef with an expert knowledge of Saturnian cuisine had\r\nbeen rushed from Washington. Since the school food was inedible for all\r\nintelligent life-forms, everyone ate the Saturnian dishes and praised\r\nNarli as a public benefactor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat night, alone in the quiet confines of his small room at the Men\'s\r\nFaculty Club, Narli had spread out his notes and was about to start work\r\non his history when there was a knock at the door. He trotted over to\r\nopen it, grumbling to himself.\r\n\r\nThe head of his department smiled brightly down at him. "Some of us are\r\ngoing out for a couple of drinks and a gabfest. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
Care to come along?"\r\n\r\nNarli did not see how he could refuse and still carry the Saturnian\'s\r\nburden, so he accepted. Discovering that gin fizzes and Alexanders were\r\neven more palatable than champagne and more potent than vilbar, he told\r\nseveral Saturnine locker-room stories which were hailed with loud\r\nmerriment. But he was being laughed _at_, not _with_, he knew. All this\r\nfalse cordiality, he assured himself, would die down after a couple of\r\ndays, and then he would be able to get back to work. He must curb his\r\nintellectual impatience.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, he found that enrollment in his classes had doubled, and\r\nthe room was crowded to capacity with the bright, shining, eager faces\r\nof young Terrestrials athirst for learning. There were apples,\r\nchocolates and imported frismil nuts on his desk, as well as a pressing\r\ninvitation from Mrs. Purrington for him to spend all his weekends and\r\nholidays at the White House. The window was fitted with an\r\nair-conditioning unit which, he later discovered, his classes had\r\nchipped in to buy for him, and the temperature had been lowered to a\r\npoint where it was almost comfortable. All the students wore coats.\r\n\r\nWhen he went out on the campus, women--students, teachers, even\r\nstrangers--stopped to talk to him, to exclaim over him, to touch him,\r\neven to kiss him. Photographers were perpetually taking pictures, some\r\nof which turned up in the Student Union as full-color postcards. They\r\nsold like Lajl out of season.\r\n\r\nNarli wrote in Saturnian on the back of one: "Having miserable time; be\r\nglad you\'re not here," and sent it to Slood.\r\n\r\nThere were cocktail parties, musicales and balls in Narli\'s honor. When\r\nhe tried to refuse an invitation, he was accused of shyness and\r\nvirtually dragged to the affair by laughing members of the faculty. He\r\nput on so much weight that he had to buy a complete new Terrestrial\r\noutfit, which set him back a pretty penny. As a result, he had to\r\naugment his income by lecturing to women\'s clubs. They slobbered\r\nappallingly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNarli\'s students did all their homework assiduously and, in fact, put in\r\nmore work than had been assigned. At the end of the year, not only did\r\nall of them pass, but with flying colors.\r\n\r\n"I hope you\'ll remember, Professor Gzann," the President of the\r\nUniversity said, "that there will always be a job waiting for you\r\nhere--a non-exchange professorship. Love to have you.

=== Chunk 9 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Thank you," Narli replied politely.\r\n\r\nMrs. Purrington broke into loud sobs when he told her he was leaving\r\nEarth. "Oh, I\'ll miss you so, Narli! You will write, won\'t you?

=== Chunk 10 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Yes, of course," he said grimly. That made two hundred and eighteen\r\npeople to whom he\'d had to promise to write.\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate he was traveling as a guest of the North American\r\ngovernment, he thought as he supervised the loading of his matched\r\ninterplanetary luggage; his eight steamer baskets; his leather-bound\r\n_Encyclopedia Terrestria_, with his name imprinted in gold on each\r\nvolume; his Indian war-bonnet; his oil painting of the President; and\r\nhis six cases of champagne--all parting gifts--onto the liner. Otherwise\r\nthe fee for excess luggage would take what little remained of his bank\r\naccount. There had been so many expenses--clothes and hostess gifts and\r\nice.\r\n\r\nNot all his mementoes were in his luggage. A new rare-metal watch\r\ngleamed on each of his four furry wrists; a brand-new trobskin wallet,\r\nplatinum key-chain, and uranium fountain pen were in his pocket; and a\r\ndiamond and curium bauble clasped a tie lovingly handpainted by a female\r\nstudent. The argyles on his fuzzy ankles had been knitted by another.\r\nStill another devoted pupil had presented him with a hand-woven plastic\r\ncase full of frismil nuts to eat on the way back.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Well, Narli!" Slood said, his face swelling with joy. "Well, well!\r\nYou\'ve put on weight, I see."\r\n\r\nNarli dropped into his old chair with a sigh. Surely Slood might have\r\npicked something else to comment on first--his haggardness, for\r\ninstance, or the increased spirituality of his expression.\r\n\r\n"Nothing else to do on Earth in your leisure moments but eat, I\r\nsuppose," Slood said, pushing over the nut tray. "Even their food. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
Have\r\nsome frismils."\r\n\r\n"No, thank you," Narli replied coldly.\r\n\r\nSlood looked at him in distress. "Oh, how you must have suffered! Was it\r\nvery, very bad, Narli?"\r\n\r\nNarli hunched low in his chair. "It was just awful."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure they didn\'t mean to be unkind," Slood assured him. "Naturally,\r\nyou were a strange creature to them and they\'re only--"\r\n\r\n"_Unkind?_" Narli gave a bitter laugh. "They practically killed me with\r\nkindness! It was fuss, fuss, fuss all the time."\r\n\r\n"Now, Narli, I do wish you wouldn\'t be quite so sarcastic."\r\n\r\n"I\'m _not_ being sarcastic. And I wasn\'t a strange creature to them. It\r\nseems there\'s a sort of popular child\'s toy on Earth known as a--" he\r\nwinced--"teddy bear. I aroused pleasant childhood memories in them, so\r\nthey showered me with affection and edibles."\r\n\r\nSlood closed his eyes in anguish. "You are very brave, Narli," he said\r\nalmost reverently. "Very brave and wise and good. Certainly that would\r\nbe the best thing to tell our people. After all, the Terrestrials are\r\nour allies; we don\'t want to stir up public sentiment against them. But\r\nyou can be honest with _me_, Narli. Did they refuse to serve you in\r\nrestaurants? Were you segregated in public vehicles? Did they shrink\r\nfrom you when you came close?"\r\n\r\nNarli beat the desk with all four hands. "I was hardly ever given the\r\nchance to be alone! They crawled all over me! Restaurants begged for my\r\ntrade! I had to hire private vehicles because in public ones I was\r\nmobbed by admirers!"\r\n\r\n"Such a short time," Slood murmured, "and already suspicious of even me,\r\nyour oldest friend. But don\'t talk about it if you don\'t want to,\r\nNarli.... Tell me, though, did they sneer at you and whisper\r\nhalf-audible insults? Did they--"\r\n\r\n"You\'re right!" Narli snapped. "I _don\'t_ want to talk about it."\r\n\r\nSlood placed a comforting hand upon his shoulder. "Perhaps that\'s\r\nwisest, until the shock of your experience has worn off."\r\n\r\nNarli made an irritable noise.\r\n\r\n"The Perzils are giving a vilbar party tonight," Slood said. "But I know\r\nhow you feel about parties. I\'ve told them you\'re exhausted from your\r\ntrip and won\'t be able to make it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you did, did you?" Narli asked ironically. "What makes you think\r\nyou know how I feel about parties?"\r\n\r\n"But--"\r\n\r\n"There\'s an interesting saying on Earth: \'Travel is so broadening.\'" He\r\nlooked down at his bulges with tolerant amusement. "In more than one\r\nway, in case the meaning eludes you. 

=== Chunk 12 ===
Very sound psychologically. I\'ve\r\ndiscovered that I _like_ parties. I _like_ being _liked_. If you\'ll\r\nexcuse me, I\'m going to inform the Perzils that I shall be delighted to\r\ncome to their party. Care to join me?"\r\n\r\n"Well," Slood mumbled, "I\'d like to, but I have so much work--"\r\n\r\n"Introvert!" said Narli, and he began dialing the Perzils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
