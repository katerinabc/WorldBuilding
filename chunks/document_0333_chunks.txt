CLAIR\r\n\r\n_Being a wizard missionary to\r\nthe Free\'l needed more than\r\nmagic--it called for a miracle!_\r\n\r\n[Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\nWorlds of If Science Fiction, January 1960.\r\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe spell the Free\'l were casting ought to have drawn the moon down\r\nfrom the heavens, made water run uphill, and inverted the order of the\r\nseasons. But, since they had got broor\'s blood instead of newt\'s, were\r\nusing alganon instead of vervet juice, and were three days later than\r\nthe solstice anyhow, nothing happened.\r\n\r\nNeeshan watched their antics with a bitter smile.\r\n\r\nHe\'d tried hard with them. The Free\'l were really a challenge to\r\nevangelical wizardry. They had some natural talent for magic, as was\r\nevinced by the frequent attempts they made to perform it, and they were\r\ninterested in what he told them about its capacities. But they simply\r\nwouldn\'t take the trouble to do it right.\r\n\r\nHow long had they been stamping around in their circle, anyhow? Since\r\nearly moonset, and it was now almost dawn. No doubt they would go on\r\nstamping all next day, if not interrupted. It was time to call a halt.\r\n\r\nNeeshan strode into the middle of the circle. Rhn, the village chief,\r\nlooked up from his drumming.\r\n\r\n"Go away," he said. "You\'ll spoil the charm."\r\n\r\n"What charm? Can\'t you see by now, Rhn, that it isn\'t going to work?"\r\n\r\n"Of course it will. It just takes time."\r\n\r\n"Hell it will. Hell it does.

Watch.

"\r\n\r\nNeeshan pushed Rhn to one side and squatted down in the center of the\r\ncircle. From the pockets of his black robe he produced stylus, dragon\'s\r\nblood, oil of anointing, and salt.\r\n\r\nHe drew a design on the ground with the stylus, dropped dragon\'s blood\r\nat the corners of the parallelogram, and touched the inner cusps with\r\nthe oil. Then, sighting carefully at the double red and white sun,\r\nwhich was just coming up, he touched the _outer_ cusps with salt. An\r\nintense smoke sprang up.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the smoke died away, a small lizardlike creature was visible in\r\nthe parallelogram.\r\n\r\n"Tell the demon what you want," Neeshan ordered the Free\'l.\r\n\r\nThe Free\'l hesitated. They had few wants, after all, which was one of\r\nthe things that made teaching them magic difficult.\r\n\r\n"Two big dyla melons," one of the younger ones said at last.\r\n\r\n"A new andana necklace," said another.\r\n\r\n"A tooter like the one you have," said Rhn, who was ambitious.\r\n\r\n"Straw for a new roof on my hut," said one of the older females.\r\n\r\n"That\'s enough for now," Neeshan interrupted. "The demon can\'t bring\r\nyou a tooter, Rhn--you have to ask another sort of demon for that. The\r\nother things he can get. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Sammel, to work!"\r\n\r\nThe lizard in the parallelogram twitched its tail. It disappeared, and\r\nreturned almost immediately with melons, a handsome necklace, and an\r\nenormous heap of straw.\r\n\r\n"Can I go now?" it asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes." Neeshan turned to the Free\'l, who were sharing the dyla melons\r\nout around their circle. "You see? 

=== Chunk 5 ===
_That\'s_ how it ought to be. You\r\ncast a spell. You\'re careful with it. And it works. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Right away."\r\n\r\n"When you do it, it works," Rhn answered.\r\n\r\n"Magic works when _anybody_ does it. But you have to do it right."\r\n\r\nRhn raised his mud-plastered shoulders in a shrug. "It\'s such a lot\r\nof dreeze, doing it that way. Magic ought to be fun." He walked away,\r\nmunching on a slice of the melon the demon had brought.\r\n\r\nNeeshan stared after him, his eyes hot. "Dreeze" was a Free\'l word that\r\nreferred originally to the nasal drip that accompanied that race\'s\r\nvirulent head colds. It had been extended to mean almost anything\r\nannoying. The Free\'l, who spent much of their time sitting in the rain,\r\nhad a lot of colds in the head.\r\n\r\nWasn\'t there anything to be done with these people? Even the simplest\r\nspell was too dreezish for them to bother with.\r\n\r\nHe was getting a headache. He\'d better perform a headache-removing\r\nspell.\r\n\r\nHe retired to the hut the Free\'l had assigned to him. The spell worked,\r\nof course, but it left him feeling soggy and dispirited. He was still\r\nstanding in the hut, wondering what he should do next, when his big\r\nblack-and-gold tooter in the corner gave a faint "woof." That meant\r\nheadquarters wanted to communicate with him.\r\n\r\nNeeshan carefully aligned the tooter, which is basically a sort of lens\r\nfor focusing neural force, with the rising double suns. He moved his\r\ncouch out into a parallel position and lay down on it. In a minute or\r\ntwo he was deep in a cataleptic trance.\r\n\r\nThe message from headquarters was long, circuitous, and couched in the\r\nelaborate, ego-caressing ceremonial of high magic, but its gist was\r\nclear enough.\r\n\r\n"Your report received," it boiled down to. "We are glad to hear that\r\nyou are keeping on with the Free\'l. We do not expect you to succeed\r\nwith them--none of the other magical missionaries we have sent out ever\r\nhas. But if you _should_ succeed, by any chance, you would get your\r\nsenior warlock\'s rating immediately. It would be no exaggeration, in\r\nfact, to say that the highest offices in the Brotherhood would be open\r\nto you."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNeeshan came out of his trance. His eyes were round with wonder and\r\ncupidity. His senior warlock\'s rating--why, he wasn\'t due to get that\r\nfor nearly four more six hundred-and-five-day years. And the highest\r\noffices in the Brotherhood--that could mean anything. Anything! He\r\nhadn\'t realized the Brotherhood set such store on converting the\r\nFree\'l. Well, now, a reward like that was worth going to some trouble\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nNeeshan sat down on his couch, his elbows on his knees, his fists\r\npressed against his forehead, and tried to think.\r\n\r\nThe Free\'l liked magic, but they were lazy. Anything that involved\r\naccuracy impressed them as dreezish. And they didn\'t want anything.\r\nThat was the biggest difficulty. Magic had nothing to offer them. He\r\nhad never, Neeshan thought, heard one of the Free\'l express a want.\r\n\r\nWait, though. There was Rhn.\r\n\r\nHe had shown a definite interest in Neeshan\'s tooter. Something in its\r\nintricate, florid black-and-gold curves seemed to fascinate him. True,\r\nhe hadn\'t been interested in it for its legitimate uses, which were to\r\nextend and develop a magician\'s spiritual power. He probably thought\r\nthat having it would give him more prestige and influence among his\r\npeople. But for one of the Free\'l to say "I wish I had that" about\r\nanything whatever meant that he could be worked on. Could the tooter be\r\nused as a bribe?\r\n\r\nNeeshan sighed heavily. Getting a tooter was painful and laborious. A\r\ntooter was carefully fitted to an individual magician\'s personality; in\r\na sense, it was a part of his personality, and if Neeshan let Rhn have\r\nhis tooter, he would be letting him have a part of himself. But the\r\nstakes were enormous.\r\n\r\nNeeshan got up from his couch. It had begun to rain, but he didn\'t want\r\nto spend time performing a rain-repelling spell. He wanted to find Rhn.\r\n\r\nRhn was standing at the edge of the swamp, luxuriating in the downpour.\r\nThe mud had washed from his shoulders, and he was already sniffling.\r\nNeeshan came to the point directly.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll give you my tooter," he said, almost choking over the words, "if\r\nyou\'ll do a spell--a simple spell, mind you--exactly right."\r\n\r\nRhn hesitated. Neeshan felt an impulse to kick him. Then he said,\r\n"Well...."\r\n\r\nNeeshan began his instructions. It wouldn\'t do for him to help Rhn too\r\ndirectly, but he was willing to do everything reasonable. Rhn listened,\r\nscratching himself in the armpits and sneezing from time to time.\r\n\r\nAfter Neeshan had been through the directions twice, Rhn stopped him.\r\n"No, don\'t bother telling me again--it\'s just more dreeze. Give me the\r\nmaterials and I\'ll show you. Don\'t forget, you\'re giving me the tooter\r\nfor this."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe started off, Neeshan after him, to the latter\'s hut. While Neeshan\r\nlooked on tensely, Rhn began going through the actions Neeshan had\r\ntold him. Half-way through the first decad, he forgot. He inverted\r\nthe order of the hand-passes, sprinkled salt on the wrong point, and\r\nmispronounced the names in the invocation. When he pulled his hands\r\napart at the end, only a tiny yellow flame sprang up.\r\n\r\nNeeshan cursed bitterly. Rhn, however, was delighted. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
"Look at that,\r\nwill you!" he exclaimed, clapping his chapped, scabby little hands\r\ntogether. "It worked! I\'ll take the tooter home with me now."\r\n\r\n"The tooter? For _that_? You didn\'t do the spell right."\r\n\r\nRhn stared at him indignantly. "You mean, you\'re not going to give me\r\nthe tooter after all the trouble I went to? I only did it as a favor,\r\nreally. Neeshan, I think it\'s very mean of you."\r\n\r\n"Try the spell again."\r\n\r\n"Oh, dreeze. You\'re too impatient. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
You never give anything time to\r\nwork."\r\n\r\nHe got up and walked off.\r\n\r\nFor the next few days, everybody in the village avoided Neeshan. They\r\nall felt sorry for Rhn, who\'d worked so hard, done everything he was\r\ntold to, and been cheated out of his tooter by Neeshan. In the end\r\nthe magician, cursing his own weakness, surrendered the tooter to\r\nRhn. The accusatory atmosphere in the normally indifferent Free\'l was\r\nintolerable.\r\n\r\nBut now what was he to do? He\'d given up his tooter--he had to ask\r\nRhn to lend it to him when he wanted to contact headquarters--and the\r\nsenior rating was no nearer than before. His head ached constantly,\r\nand all the spells he performed to cure the pain left him feeling\r\nwretchedly tired out.\r\n\r\nMagic, however, is an art of many resources, not all of them savory.\r\nNeeshan, in his desperation, began to invoke demons more disreputable\r\nthan those he would ordinarily have consulted. In effect, he turned for\r\nhelp to the magical underworld.\r\n\r\nHis thuggish informants were none too consistent. One demon told him\r\none thing, another something else. The consensus, though, was that\r\nwhile there was nothing the Free\'l actually wanted enough to go to any\r\ntrouble for it (they didn\'t even want to get rid of their nasal drip,\r\nfor example--in a perverse way they were proud of it), there _was_ one\r\nthing they disliked intensely--Neeshan himself.\r\n\r\nThe Free\'l thought, the demons reported, that he was inconsiderate,\r\ntactless, officious, and a crashing bore. They regarded him as the\r\npsychological equivalent of the worst case of dreeze ever known,\r\ncarried to the nth power. They wished he\'d drop dead or hang himself.\r\n\r\nNeeshan dismissed the last of the demons. His eyes had begun to shine.\r\nThe Free\'l thought he was a nuisance, did they? They thought he was the\r\nmost annoying thing they\'d encountered in the course of their racial\r\nhistory? Good. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
Fine. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
Splendid. Then he\'d _really_ annoy them.\r\n\r\nHe\'d have to watch out for poison, of course. But in the end, they\'d\r\nturn to magic to get rid of him. They\'d have to. And then he\'d have\r\nthem. They\'d be caught.\r\n\r\nOne act of communal magic that really worked and they\'d be sold on\r\nmagic. He\'d be sure of his senior rating.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNeeshan began his campaign immediately. Where the Free\'l were, there\r\nwas he. He was always on hand with unwanted explanations, hypercritical\r\nobjections, and maddening "wouldn\'t-it-be-betters."\r\n\r\nWhereas earlier in his evangelical mission he had confined himself to\r\npointing out how much easier magic would make life for the Free\'l, he\r\nnow counciled and advised them on every phase of their daily routine,\r\nfrom mud-smearing to rain-sitting, and from the time they got up until\r\nthey went to bed. He even pursued them with advice _after_ they got\r\ninto bed, and told them how to run their sex lives--advice which the\r\nFree\'l, who set quite as much store by their sex lives as anybody does,\r\nresented passionately.\r\n\r\nBut most of all he harped on their folly in putting up with nasal drip,\r\nand instructed them over and over again in the details of a charm--a\r\nquite simple charm--for getting rid of it. The charm would, he informed\r\nthem, work equally well against anything--_or person_--that they found\r\nannoying.\r\n\r\nThe food the Free\'l brought him began to have a highly peculiar taste.\r\nNeeshan grinned and hung a theriacal charm, a first-class antidote\r\nto poison, around his neck. The Free\'l\'s distaste for him bothered\r\nhim, naturally, but he could stand it. When he had repeated the\r\nanti-annoyance charm to a group of Free\'l last night, he had noticed\r\nthat Rhn was listening eagerly. It wouldn\'t be much longer now.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the day before the equinox, Neeshan was awakened from\r\nsleep by an odd prickling sensation in his ears. It was a sensation\r\nhe\'d experienced only once before in his life, during his novitiate,\r\nand it took him a moment to identify it. Then he realized what it was.\r\nSomebody was casting a spell against him.\r\n\r\nAt last! At last! It had worked!\r\n\r\nNeeshan put on his robe and hurried to the door of the hut. The day\r\nseemed remarkably overcast, almost like night, but that was caused by\r\nthe spell. This one happened to involve the optic nerves.\r\n\r\nHe began to grope his way cautiously toward the village center. He\r\ndidn\'t want the Free\'l to see him and get suspicious, but he did want\r\nto have the pleasure of seeing them cast their first accurate spell.\r\n(He was well protected against wind-damage from it, of course.) When\r\nhe was almost at the center, he took cover behind a hut. He peered out.\r\n\r\nThey were doing it _right_. Oh, what a satisfaction! Neeshan felt his\r\nchest expand with pride. And when the spell worked, when the big wind\r\nswooped down and blew him away, the Free\'l would certainly receive a\r\nsecond magical missionary more kindly. Neeshan might even come back,\r\nwell disguised, himself.\r\n\r\nThe ritual went on. The dancers made three circles to the left,\r\nthree circles to the right. Cross over, and all sprinkle salt on the\r\ninterstices of the star Rhn had traced on the ground with the point of\r\na knife. Back to the circle. One to the left, one to right, while Rhn,\r\nin the center of the circle, dusted over the salt with--with _what_?\r\n\r\n"Hey!" Neeshan yelled in sudden alarm. "Not brimstone! Watch out!\r\nYou\'re not doing it ri--"\r\n\r\nHis chest contracted suddenly, as if a large, stony hand had seized\r\nhis thorax above the waist. He couldn\'t breathe, he couldn\'t think,\r\nhe couldn\'t even say "Ouch!" It felt as if his chest--no, his whole\r\nbody--was being compressed in on itself and turning into something as\r\nhard as stone.\r\n\r\nHe tried to wave his tiny, heavy arms in a counter-charm; he couldn\'t\r\neven inhale. The last emotion he experienced was one of bitterness. He\r\nmight have _known_ the Free\'l couldn\'t get anything right.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Free\'l take a dim view of the small stone image that now stands in\r\nthe center of their village. It is much too heavy for them to move, and\r\nwhile it is not nearly so much of a nuisance as Neeshan was when he was\r\nalive, it inconveniences them. They have to make a detour around it\r\nwhen they do their magic dances.\r\n\r\nThey still hope, though, that the spells they are casting to get rid of\r\nhim will work eventually. If he doesn\'t go away this autumn, he will\r\nthe autumn after next. They have a good deal of faith in magic, when\r\nyou come right down to it. And patience is their long suit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s The Autumn After Next, by Margaret St. Clair\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
