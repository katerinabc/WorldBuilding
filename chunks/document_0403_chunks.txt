It was an impossible fact--but then, so was\r\n    the girl who they knew couldn\'t exist!\r\n\r\n\r\nRed Brewer had plugged his electric razor into the lab circuit and he\r\nwas running it over his pink jowls while I tried to discover what was\r\nhaywire about the balance scales.\r\n\r\n"Have you noticed," Red said above the clatter of his shaver, "how much\r\nless you have to shave on an asteroid?"\r\n\r\n"I still shave every day," I said. There was something definitely wrong\r\nwith the scales. The ten-gram weight didn\'t balance two five-gram\r\nweights. Instead it weighed 7.5 grams. And then, suddenly, the cockeyed\r\nscales would get ornery and the two five-gram weights would weigh 7.5\r\ngrams and the ten-gram slug would weigh what it should.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t," said Red. "I shave once a week. Back on terra I shaved every\r\nday, but not here. And I don\'t even have a beard to show for it.

=== Chunk 2 ===
"\r\n\r\nI didn\'t answer. There were tougher problems on my mind than whiskers,\r\nbut of course Red Brewer wouldn\'t understand them. He was good at\r\nmachinery, and with a camera, and for company on a lonely asteroid which\r\nright now was 300,000,000 miles from the earth, but he certainly wasn\'t\r\na brain.\r\n\r\n"What do you make of it, Jay?" he asked. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
"Oh, Mr. Hayling, I\'m speaking\r\nto you."\r\n\r\n"Maybe it\'s your thyroid," I said. "Shut up."\r\n\r\n"I\'m twenty-seven," said Red. "Too old to have thyroids."\r\n\r\n"You mean adenoids."\r\n\r\nRed growled and shut off the razor. He ran his hand over his face. "I\'ve\r\ngot a face like a school-kid\'s," he said. "If there was only a girl on\r\nthis god-forsaken piece of rock to see it."\r\n\r\nThere were no girls on Asteroid 57GM. This place didn\'t have anything\r\nexcepting a lonely shack with paper-thin walls made of special\r\nheat-insulating material. There wasn\'t a blade of grass; not a puff of\r\nwind; no soil for violets; not even a symmetrical shape, it was lopsided\r\nlike a beaten-up baseball. Or at least that was what I thought until\r\nsomething happened to the balance scales.\r\n\r\nThe idea of sending Jay Hayling, which is me, and ruddy Red Brewer to\r\nAsteroid 57GM, was simply to check up on some figures which said that\r\nthis little 10-mile chunk of rock didn\'t have the right mass. Twice it\r\nhad been clocked on near passages to Jupiter and twice it had behaved\r\ndifferently, as if it had suddenly lost some of its mass. So Red and I\r\nhad been sentenced to fifteen months alone in space on an asteroid just\r\nto find out that somebody had made a mistake in arithmetic.\r\n\r\nThe sonar equipment showed what kind of rock it was--iron and basalt.\r\nAnd I\'d made borings which checked. We\'d tested the speed of escape\r\nwhich was a good push so we had to be careful, and its force of gravity,\r\nwhich wasn\'t much. And then I\'d discovered that the balance in the lab\r\nhad a habit of being 25 per cent wrong one way or the other every time\r\nI tried to use it.\r\n\r\nRed put away his razor and went through the little door leading to the\r\nliving quarters. The partition was crystal clear plastic so I could see\r\nhim pulling himself along by the hand rail toward the bookcase. I knew\r\nhe would presently find himself something to read while I worked.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe seldom walked in the laboratory. Our muscles, conditioned by\r\nterrestrial gravity, were too strong for walking. We\'d have bumped our\r\nheads on the ceiling at every step and possibly we might even have\r\npunched a hole in the roof, losing our air. So we sort of pulled\r\nourselves along by a system of hand rails on all of the anchored desks,\r\nfurniture and walls. It was like pulling yourself along the bottom of\r\nthe ocean by hanging onto rocks, since the air in the lab was dense\r\nenough to support our almost weightless bodies.\r\n\r\nI checked the scales every way I could and finally gave up. I\'d tackle\r\nthe problem again tomorrow. Maybe something on the asteroid, some\r\nmagnetic rock or something, threw it off. I washed my hands in the\r\nlaboratory sink and then, while I wiped them on a towel, glanced at Red,\r\nwho was lying on his bunk reading. For the first time I noticed how\r\nskinny he was getting. Lack of exercise, I presumed. We were going to\r\nhave to do something to build up our muscles again. I supposed I had\r\nlost weight just as much as he had. It would be tough to weigh ourselves\r\nhere, since we had only the balance in the laboratory. Spring scales\r\nwouldn\'t work on the asteroid--we wouldn\'t have weighed enough to\r\nregister, even though our mass was probably about the same as an average\r\nman\'s on earth.\r\n\r\nRed put the book aside, closed his eyes and smiled. My eyes fell on the\r\nbook for some reason. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Then suddenly I saw a page flip over. I didn\'t\r\nrealize at first that this couldn\'t happen.\r\n\r\nThere wasn\'t any draft in the place, I was sure of that. A draft would\r\nmean a leak in the laboratory and alarms would tell us when that\r\nhappened. There was no motion, nothing to cause a page in the book to\r\nturn.\r\n\r\nAnother page turned and I was sure I wasn\'t dreaming. I pulled myself\r\nover to the door, opened it a trifle.\r\n\r\n"Red!" I called softly.\r\n\r\n"Dollie!" He was dreaming. Dollie was one of the dozen or so girls he\r\nwas always talking about in his sleep.\r\n\r\nI pulled myself to his side and punched him gently. Red woke up. "You\'re\r\na hell of a guy," he said.\r\n\r\n"Yes," I said. "You were dreaming about Dollie. But I saw something\r\nhappen here and I wanted you to see it too." I pointed at the book. The\r\npages were still now. Suddenly one of them flipped over.\r\n\r\n"Somebody, or something is reading your book," I said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe didn\'t figure it out then and I wasn\'t even sure that I\'d made the\r\nright diagnosis, but things went on every day afterwards that left me\r\nconvinced there was something else living on this hunk of rock besides\r\nRed and me. It didn\'t have mass, apparently, because we tried our best\r\nto touch it.\r\n\r\nOnce when it got to fooling around with the laboratory balance, Red and\r\nI encircled the balance with our arms and then squeezed together without\r\nfeeling a thing.\r\n\r\nIt wasn\'t energy, because we tried every instrument to detect\r\nelectricity, heat, light, and radio. But it was alive, because it moved.\r\nIt read books and monkeyed with the lab scales.\r\n\r\nAnd at last I decided that maybe _it_ had something to do with the\r\napparent discrepancy in the asteroid\'s change in mass. After that I had\r\na great deal to work on.\r\n\r\nRed began behaving queerly too. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
He swore that he was getting too small\r\nfor his clothing. His shoes, he said, were almost a size too large. I\r\nwas too busy to check, so I put it down as a loss in weight.\r\n\r\nWe\'d spent a year on the asteroid when we were due to pass Mars. So our\r\nfirst anniversary was spent in checking our movements with a telescope,\r\na camera and a chronometer. We discovered our mass--or that of Asteroid\r\n57GM--had depreciated another 25 per cent. It now had only half the mass\r\nit was supposed to have. This was too much of an error for even a grade\r\nschool student.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll bet some astronomers back on earth will get redder than my hair\r\nwhen we get home," Red said.\r\n\r\nI shook my head. "It hasn\'t anything to do with their observations," I\r\nsaid. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
"It\'s what is happening now to you and me. We\'re losing mass\r\nsomeway."\r\n\r\nThere was only one way to check it and that was to weigh ourselves. So I\r\nrigged up a rude sort of a balance by weighing out chunks of rock until\r\nwe had a mass equal to what we should weigh, placing them on a\r\nteeter-totter arrangement I rigged up in the lab.\r\n\r\n"It\'ll be close enough to learn if we\'ve lost half our mass," I said.\r\n\r\nRed showed a weight loss equal to about 20 pounds on earth. I had gained\r\na little weight. These figures were only relative, and dependent on\r\nwhether or not the rocks we\'d used on the balance had lost mass also.\r\nBut something was wrong with Red and I decided to watch him carefully.\r\n\r\n"Your scales are cockeyed," Red said. "I feel fine. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Never felt better,\r\nin fact. Except that I\'m lonesome ... not that I don\'t enjoy your\r\ncompany, pal, ole pal, but I\'d like Dollie\'s better."\r\n\r\nSomething on the far side of the room caught my eye. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
It was along the\r\nglass partition between the lab and the living room. It might have been\r\na reflection of some sort, because the sun was up and its beams were\r\ncoming right through the transparent roof at that moment. But for a\r\nfleeting instant I thought I saw a figure there. A tall, shapely,\r\nblack-haired girl, dressed in a flowing robe of orange. The next instant\r\nshe was gone.\r\n\r\nI said I thought it might be a reflection, but I was pretty sure it\r\nwasn\'t. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
"Red," I said. "We\'ve got company."\r\n\r\n"Huh?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure of it, Red. There\'s somebody else here besides us."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no one else. You\'re crazy." Red looked around the room. Then he\r\nlooked at me. His gaze was sharp and penetrating.\r\n\r\n"You can\'t see it now," I said. "But I\'m sure I saw something. A woman.\r\nOver there." I pointed to where I\'d seen the thing that might have been\r\na reflection.\r\n\r\n"Maybe you\'d better lie down, Jay. You\'ve been working too hard. A year\r\nout on this rock could make a man see King Solomon\'s harem."\r\n\r\n"No, Red," I said. "Those funny things we saw, your book pages turning;\r\nthe cockeyed balance; maybe your loss of weight. They aren\'t natural.\r\nSomething is here and what I just saw makes me think it\'s human and it\'s\r\ntrying to get in touch with us."\r\n\r\nRed\'s stomach muscles squeezed with laughter and he held onto a guard\r\nrail to keep from being sent across the room by the exertion.\r\n\r\n"What I saw was a woman, Red," I went on.\r\n\r\nRed laughed out loud and hung on again. "I could use a babe," he said.\r\nSuddenly he jerked. "Who hit me?" 

=== Chunk 10 ===
he asked. Across his face was a red\r\nwelt, the shape of a woman\'s hand.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe called them "manifestations" after that and Red called her his ghost\r\nsweetheart, although the slap had convinced him it wasn\'t a ghost. Red\'s\r\ngetting slapped was the first indication that perhaps this thing did\r\nhave matter of some sort, but its ability to remain invisible made it\r\nappear that the matter wasn\'t the ordinary kind.\r\n\r\nFinally I came up with some sort of an answer. It was just a crazy idea\r\nand there was no way to prove that I was right. I tried to explain it to\r\nRed, who didn\'t know much about atomic physics, but he seemed to get the\r\nidea.\r\n\r\n"You see, Red, it could be _negative_ matter," I explained.\r\n\r\n"What\'s that?"\r\n\r\n"Well, you know what an electron is, I suppose, a negatively charged\r\nsub-atomic particle?"\r\n\r\nRed nodded.\r\n\r\n"And a proton, which is positively charged?"\r\n\r\nAgain he nodded.\r\n\r\n"Well, scientists have learned that there could be positive electrons,\r\nas well as negative, and negative protons. In other words each\r\nsub-atomic particle has a \'minus quantity\' counterpart."\r\n\r\n"You\'re saying it, I\'m believing it," said Red. "A guy\'s gotta believe\r\nsomething."\r\n\r\n"Well, this leads to a great deal of speculation. If these minus\r\nquantities got together they might form a minus matter."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got me in a hole, so I\'m minus too."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t have to understand it, but try to imagine that two universes\r\ncould exist side by side, one minus, one plus, and that neither could be\r\naware of the other. Every star, every planet and every speck of matter\r\ncould have its counterpart, but neither would be aware of that\r\ncounterpart\'s existence."\r\n\r\nRed grinned and shook his head. "Crazy," he said.\r\n\r\n"Yes, crazy. But dig this, supposing that some sixth sense made it\r\npossible for one of our minus counterparts to get in contact with us\r\nthrough extra-sensory perception."\r\n\r\n"How\'d they do it?" Red asked.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. We don\'t know how to do it, but it may be that our\r\nscientific progress wouldn\'t keep abreast of each other. We might know\r\nmore than our minus counterparts in some fields, and they might know\r\nmore in others. But their special knowledge enabled them to bridge the\r\ngap briefly--long enough to see us, and watch us--"\r\n\r\n"And read our books." Red nodded.\r\n\r\n"And perhaps learn our language--remember you got slapped."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll watch it," said Red.\r\n\r\n"There\'s no reason why the gap couldn\'t be bridged. Science and minds\r\nhave done a lot of things that looked impossible."\r\n\r\nWe went to bed on that and all night long I dreamed of negative\r\nuniverses, with suns like old Sol except that they shone black in bright\r\nheavens and planets of space floating in vacuums of matter. Red must\r\nhave dreamed about it too, because he had a question over the dehydrated\r\nham and eggs the next morning.\r\n\r\n"Does that explain the loss in mass for this asteroid?"\r\n\r\n"I think it does. Either the method our minus counterparts have in\r\nbridging the gap, or perhaps some sort of space warp that permits them\r\nto do it. At any rate enough of the minus world has been projected\r\nthrough to our side of the equation to displace the mass of this\r\nplanetoid. Our lab scales being haywire might be the result of a being\'s\r\nnearness to it, or something."\r\n\r\nRed didn\'t digest it all, but I could see he was thinking. "I wonder\r\nwhat all this has to do with my whiskers," he mused.\r\n\r\nWe were busy making some further checks on the planetoid\'s mass later in\r\nthe day when Red got a glimpse of the vision I\'d seen. Red didn\'t take\r\nit quietly. He yelled loud and pointed.\r\n\r\nI turned just in time to see her fade away. It was the same woman,\r\ndressed the same. But this time she had been a bit more than a vapor.\r\n\r\nRed forgot where he was and made a dive toward her. His body shot like a\r\nbullet across the room, skimming over laboratory equipment, and his head\r\ncrashed solidly against the telescope.\r\n\r\nRed literally bounced back halfway again. Then a long thin arm seemed to\r\nreach out of nowhere and seize him by the jacket and hold him long\r\nenough to stop him.\r\n\r\nRed drifted down to the floor, knocked cold.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt had happened so swiftly that I hadn\'t had time to move. Now I pulled\r\nmyself toward Red. The arm was still there in space, and it had added a\r\nshoulder, a rather pretty shoulder. Next there was a body, clothed in\r\nthe flowing orange cape, and finally a woman\'s head. It was the same\r\none--the minus woman.\r\n\r\n"It\'s true," I said.\r\n\r\nThe woman seemed to understand. "Yes," she said. "All that you told Red\r\nBrewer is true, Jay Hayling. For you, I am a minus woman. For me, you\r\nare a minus man. But we have bridged the gap. For the first time in\r\neternity, plus and minus, positive and negative, can meet on even\r\nterms."\r\n\r\n"Better not come too close," I said.\r\n\r\n"Nothing will happen," she replied. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
"We are now alike." She stooped\r\ntoward the fallen figure on the floor. "Help me with this child. He\'s\r\nunconscious."\r\n\r\n"Child!" I said. "If he\'s a child, they grow \'em big in the minus\r\nworld."\r\n\r\nBut as I lifted Jay off the floor I wondered if he was as big as I\'d\r\nalways thought. It wasn\'t his weight. Nothing weighed very much on this\r\nasteroid, but it was his frail body. He seemed to be a boy of sixteen,\r\nrather than a man stationed 300,000,000 miles in space.\r\n\r\nI carried him out of the laboratory into the living quarters and placed\r\nhim on his bunk. I loosened his clothing, noting at the time that he had\r\nbeen right about his garments not fitting him.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve made him lose weight," I said.\r\n\r\n"What makes you think so?" the woman asked.\r\n\r\n"Because every screwy thing that has happened since we came here a year\r\nago must have an explanation."\r\n\r\nThe woman smiled. "Don\'t think too harshly of me." She looked very solid\r\nnow. Her body had lost that tenuous look. She was no longer nebulous and\r\ncloud-like. "Certain things were necessary in order for me to proceed\r\nsafely through the gap between the positive and negative worlds," she\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\nI looked at Red again. His face was smooth and I knew he hadn\'t shaved\r\nin more than a week. "You\'ve made him younger," I said. "Well, he\r\nshouldn\'t kick at that."\r\n\r\nThe woman nodded. "I turned the young man inside out. In a moment the\r\ntransition will be complete. You will be our next entrance to this\r\nuniverse...."\r\n\r\nFrom Red\'s bunk came a wail. A bawl, like a tiny baby. A dying baby.\r\n\r\nSome people die of age. Red died an infant. As for the minus woman--she\r\nwas murdered on an asteroid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Imagination Stories of Science and\r\n    Fantasy_ July 1953.
