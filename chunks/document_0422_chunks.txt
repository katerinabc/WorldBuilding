Harris\r\n\r\n               It was Bailey\'s first trip into space and\r\n            things began to happen that made him wonder if\r\n            luck alone would bring him back to Earth alive!\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Imagination Stories of Science and Fantasy\r\n                              August 1957\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n... _A hand moved_ ...\r\n\r\nYoung Bailey fell. It was a terrible sensation, falling. Bailey was not\r\nsure how long he had been falling. There was no one near him. They had\r\nbeen scattered like seeds from a burst pod when the meteor hulled the\r\nship. Bailey was falling through the dark alone; he had been falling\r\nendlessly.\r\n\r\n... _Those with him now were all palefaced with fear_ ...\r\n\r\nThe voice of Krotzer was still in the headphones: "... closing in on\r\nme, I can\'t describe them, you\'ve got to get here...." Krotzer had\r\nmeant so much for so long; now his voice was less than nothing. Bailey\r\nwas falling like a stone; the sensation drove everything else out of\r\nhim. Bailey could not stand it any longer, and began to scream.\r\n\r\nIt shattered his visor and icy space rushed in. There was light and\r\nhis captain was looking at him. Captain DiCredico was shaking him.\r\n\r\nBailey\'s face was dripping. He grabbed the skipper. "I\'m falling! Hold\r\nme!"\r\n\r\n... _Thousands of eyes bulged, hands twitched_ ...\r\n\r\nDiCredico squeezed a plastic bottle, squirting water into his face.\r\nDrops spattered and drifted off slowly through the air. Bailey blinked\r\nand stared. He was aboard the Ranger. Safe. Then panic came gibbering\r\nback at him as his body told him unmistakably he was falling.\r\n\r\n"You\'re not!" snapped DiCredico. "No gravity, remember? Spin ship!" he\r\nordered over his shoulder.\r\n\r\nGently, Bailey\'s body felt the reassuring tug as centrifugal force\r\nduplicated a light gravity and the alarm bells in his nerves and\r\nglands stopped ringing. The hull of the ship became "down," and men\r\nwalked instead of floating--walked on the walls and ceiling, too, like\r\nwheel-spokes radiating from the axis of spin.\r\n\r\n"Over it?" asked DiCredico.\r\n\r\n"I guess so. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
I\'m sorry.

=== Chunk 3 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Happens to all of us. Human body is made with a built-in, full-scale\r\nemergency response to falling--and lack of gravity is what triggers\r\nit. When you\'re awake you can consciously control it. I\'m going to have\r\nto quit spinning ship now--can\'t take bearings, and this slant-standing\r\ncan be worse than no gravity."\r\n\r\nThe substitute gravity faded and Bailey\'s body tried to panic again,\r\nbut he reined it in firmly. He went forward to watch television. It was\r\nthe same canned show he\'d seen ten times already. And the canned radio\r\nshow was one he hadn\'t liked in the first place. The Service did its\r\nbest to make a ship a synthetic, miniature Earth--but it couldn\'t. Ten\r\nmonths already--maybe a year more. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Plenty of people blew their stacks.\r\nA wonder they all didn\'t. Would he?\r\n\r\nLike black, bad blood, a pulse of fear in Bailey\'s mind.\r\n\r\n... _and in those others that were his_ ...\r\n\r\nIt was time for his stint on radar. Benning handed him the headset\r\ngratefully. "Krotzer\'s still sending," he said. "Awful to listen to.\r\nWhatever they are, they\'re doing something to his bubble. He thinks\r\nthey may be in soon. I hope to Christ we get there."\r\n\r\n"What do you think they are, anyway?"\r\n\r\n"Beats me," Benning answered. "Looks like you\'ll see some grade-A\r\nmonsters your first time out, you lucky boy." An unconvincing smile\r\ncrossed his face, which like all their faces was dead white from months\r\nof being away from anything like sunlight. "A lot of lousy things can\r\nhappen in space. I hope we get less than our share of them."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBailey snugged the headset over his ears. The voice of Krotzer was\r\nweaker. Bailey pictured him crouched in his bubble, his radar broken\r\nand only fit for sending, wondering if any lonely ship at all was\r\nhearing him, and if it was, if it would arrive in time. Krotzer had a\r\nwife, and a child he had never seen.\r\n\r\nNow he was talking about the things outside the bubble. "I never saw\r\nanything like them. In fact, I can\'t see them. Can\'t exactly. You can\r\nsee them with your feelings, somehow--hooded sort--and beginning to\r\ncome through...."\r\n\r\nHe broke off, started again. "This is Captain Krotzer of the _Galileo_.\r\nWe have crashed on Katherine Two, satellite of Saturn, continental\r\narea. Something has killed five of us. Chan Lee and I are living in the\r\nbubble. Cannot receive you on disabled radar. Besieged."\r\n\r\nHe stopped. The headphones were silent except for the uncanny\r\nsnickering static of deep space. They sometimes called it "laughter."\r\nIt was not good for the nerves. It was as though space itself were\r\ncackling at them, thought Bailey. Get off that. Think about something\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nHe remembered Krotzer well, an expert on extra-terrestrial life, a\r\nman with a face mingling sensitivity and courage. He had lectured\r\nonce at Prelim. Bailey remembered some of it. Almost imperceptible,\r\nliving crystals that swarmed in the air of one planet. They got into\r\nyour system, converted your matter, and you suddenly crumbled into a\r\nheap of the same kind of crystals. And the unknown life of the planet\r\nCaliban, called the Shunned Planet because of some influence that\r\nreached out and sucked ships down by doing something to the minds of\r\nthe men. And the singing smoke droves. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
And the dissolvers. And others.\r\n\r\n... _A shudder in the mind of Bailey and the other same minds_ ...\r\n\r\nKrotzer was beginning again: "This is Captain Krotzer of the ..." when\r\nthere was a blinding white flash and the ship rang like a great bell\r\nslammed with a sledge-hammer. A spurt of white-hot blasted into the\r\ncompartment and Benning, who had been near the bulkhead, cartwheeled\r\nwith hands to his seared face.\r\n\r\nA wild horse of fright leaped inside Bailey and he wanted to tear off\r\nthe headset. Above the alarm bell DiCredico was yelling. "Pinhead\r\nmeteor. No danger. Jones, Alvarez, help Benning. Bulkhead will seal\r\nitself, men, it\'s only a pinhead meteor."\r\n\r\nBailey\'s ears rang. A tiny, immensely fast meteor had hit, been\r\nvaporized, the coagulant between the inner and outer shells had sealed\r\nthe hole. His spine itched. Did the little one mean they were near a\r\nswarm where they might catch a big one?\r\n\r\nHis answer was a modulated mechanical keening from the proximity\r\nteller, up forward.\r\n\r\nHe glanced at DiCredico for the don-space-suits order, but the captain\r\nwas floating forward fast and wordlessly. To control himself Bailey\r\ngave his attention to the radar. All he heard was the insinuating\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\nThe teller was howling like a hound in hell. DiCredico emerged from the\r\nforward compartment, his short bulk ungraceful in the air. "Don suits!"\r\nhe ordered. "We\'re in a swarm!"\r\n\r\nMatt wrenched off the headset and launched himself toward his suit\r\nrack. He scrambled into his suit, dogged down the helmet, and sound and\r\nfire burst through the ship.\r\n\r\nHe was lifted and slammed against a bulkhead. Black fire belched behind\r\nhis eyes. He had a flashing vision of the backyard of his folks\' home\r\nin Pittsburg, and a dark curtain fell over it.\r\n\r\n... _Everywhere they had a vision of their home in Pittsburg. A black\r\ncurtain fell over it_ ...\r\n\r\nWhen he opened his eyes he saw he was alone among a crew of death.\r\nThey hung in their spacesuits against the bulkheads like limp grey\r\nbats while the ship tore on through space. Two had failed to get their\r\nhelmets on. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Their faces were bruised plums, mottled. Inside their\r\nbloated chests, the lungs would be pink froth, literally having\r\nexploded with the instant drop in air pressure. A third man\'s suit had\r\nruptured up the front, the raggedy edges flayed back like skin. The man\r\nwas swollen like one long drowned.\r\n\r\nThere was no air. It had rushed through the barrel-sized hole in the\r\nhull. There was only one hole--the meteor had burst on impact and not\r\npassed clear through. Chunks of stone, ribbons of blood, scraps of\r\nmetal hung quiet or floated above the deck.\r\n\r\nMatt had never told anyone how he felt about space. It was a freezing,\r\nheart-killing loneliness that waited icily, and now it had come in\r\nthrough the hull and was with him. His jaw clenched. He had no idea\r\nwhether he could carry on alone, but he was going to.\r\n\r\nThen one of the grey bats stirred, drew up its legs, and launched\r\nitself off the bulkhead. The others began to move. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
A laugh rolled in\r\nBailey\'s throat. Like him, they had only been stunned.\r\n\r\nThey froze the encapsulated dead and patched the hole as best they\r\ncould and found a clock still running and re-set their instruments,\r\nand each man had a souvenir piece of meteor stone, and less than two\r\nweeks after this was done the boredom dropped over them again as though\r\nexcitement had never been.\r\n\r\nThe tension about their mission to Krotzer, tighter from hour to hour\r\nonly made it worse. They began to hate each other\'s mannerisms, the\r\nway a person scratched an ear or cleared a throat. It\'s getting you,\r\nBailey, Matt told himself. This way men go nuts.\r\n\r\n... _Go nuts, echoed the minds that were him without knowing. Go\r\nnuts ... go nuts ... go nuts_ ...\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was after chow that he did it. He walked over and turned off the\r\ntelevision. All kinds of emotions stood on the faces of the others.\r\nRage was the one on the face of a hulking man named Regan.\r\n\r\n"It was right at the best place!" growled the big spaceman. "Turn it\r\non!"\r\n\r\nMatt placed himself directly before the screen. "Turn it on yourself!"\r\nhe baited, with a twisted smile he meant to be lightly humorous.\r\n\r\nRegan shoved from the wall and floated slowly toward him.\r\n\r\n"There\'s a reason for watching this stuff," one of the crewmen put in,\r\n"I tell you we\'ve got to watch it! Turn it back on, son.

=== Chunk 8 ===
"\r\n\r\nMatt laughed. "What a stinker. The Space Service! Glamour! Commentators\r\nand books and slogans and kids and girls all talk about it like a hero\r\ncarnival but it stinks, it\'s a bunch of guys going nuts on the other\r\nside of nowhere and--"\r\n\r\nRegan hit him. He flew backward, seeing stars, rolling in the air.\r\nDiCredico\'s voice gonged from the captain\'s cabin.\r\n\r\n"Knock it off! Regan, turn the set on, get back to the entertainment.\r\nBailey, want to see you in here."\r\n\r\nIt all went out of Bailey and he felt foolish and frightened. He swung\r\ninto the cabin and floated at attention.\r\n\r\n... _They were all a recruit, frightened before DiCredico_ ...\r\n\r\nIt took DiCredico ten minutes to get through his talk with Bailey,\r\nspeaking in tough, slicing sentences. The service was no bed of roses,\r\nsaid the skipper, and nobody in the service had ever claimed it was.\r\nIt was a damned mean racket and nobody asked you to get into it. You\r\nvolunteered. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
And you didn\'t have to stay. Before each voyage you could\r\nask for honorable discharge, or earth duty if available. But once you\r\nblasted off, you had to stand the gaff. You had to.\r\n\r\nThere were men who cracked. There were whole crews. If one man lost\r\ncontrol, another might, and finally all of them. Nobody knew how many\r\nflights were lost through "mental hazard." There were shrewd guesses.\r\n\r\nBailey could make the Ranger another missing ship. And they weren\'t on\r\nfreight nor patrol--they were on a rescue mission. He should think\r\nabout that.\r\n\r\nYou had to learn to use the television and the other corny\r\n"entertainment"--let it soak you up, take you away for awhile.\r\n\r\nHe could have Bailey put under dormisol, so he\'d sleep through the rest\r\nof the trip. But he was needed. But he could request it, and DiCredico\r\nwould do it.\r\n\r\nBailey did not request it. He went back and shook hands with Regan,\r\nwho was very decent about it all, and sat down to learn to use the\r\ntelevision.\r\n\r\nThings were a little better after that.\r\n\r\n... _And they relaxed a little, the many that were one_ ...\r\n\r\nKrotzer\'s reports kept coming in, and they were nearing the unknown\r\nsatellite. Everyone felt a little numble-witted because the meteor\r\npatch was leaking and pressure was low. DiCredico kept a tight routine\r\nand they leaned into it for support.\r\n\r\nFinally a little red globe appeared on the viewer, and they were\r\napproaching Katherine Two.\r\n\r\nThey followed Krotzer\'s bearings and they saw his ship and near it the\r\nbubble. Nobody responded when they fired flares.\r\n\r\nThe Ranger touched down. DiCredico took Bailey, Regan, and the medic\r\nFry out with him. Conditions were similar to earth, and they wore no\r\nspace suits.\r\n\r\nThey swished through red waist-high growths like spongy fern.\r\n\r\n"There\'s his ship," said Fry. "It doesn\'t look in bad shape."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t tell," said DiCredico. "Funny things happen."\r\n\r\nThey reached the ship and paused by it. It appeared unharmed. A body\r\nlay near it, burned in two.\r\n\r\nMatt turned to the skipper. "It looks like--like a heater did it. Do\r\nyou suppose these things have something like that?"\r\n\r\n"Funny things happen," said DiCredico. "Anyway, he\'s dead. Let\'s get on\r\nto Krotzer."\r\n\r\nThey saw that Krotzer had half-opaqued his bubble. They would have to\r\ncome in close enough to see and be seen through it for him to know they\r\nwere there. Nobody saw any indication of life or motion outside it.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll give it a wide circle," said DiCredico. "See if there\'s any\r\nvisible danger."\r\n\r\nIt took twenty minutes to make the circle. Nobody saw anything.\r\n\r\n"Something\'s damned queer," said Regan.\r\n\r\n"Something\'s always queer," said DiCredico. "Now, here\'s the plan.\r\nGet your suits on. From Krotzer\'s reports, whatever is after him is\r\nstopped or impeded by material substance. Then we go in one at a time.\r\nI go first. If nothing happens to me, Regan comes in. If he makes it,\r\nBailey. Then Fry. If anything goes wrong, I want the man with next turn\r\nto try the other side of the bubble. Except you, Fry. If you\'re the\r\nonly one left, get back to the ship. You\'ll have to make a report, and\r\nyou and the men can decide the next step. Dig?

=== Chunk 10 ===
"\r\n\r\nThey nodded. DiCredico sauntered off through the spongy feathers. He\r\nreached the bubble, looked in, waved on Regan. Regan reached it, peered\r\ninto it, turned and waved to Bailey, an odd expression on his face.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBailey started across the red field. Aloneness, menace, strangeness\r\nsettled on him as he walked. Maybe you got used to these feelings.\r\nMaybe you got over them. Maybe they got you. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
Or maybe something else\r\ngot you. So this was the service.\r\n\r\nHe was at the bubble. Fry and DiCredico were looking at him so\r\nstrangely ... partly expectant, appraising, ironic--indefinable. Matt\r\nturned to wave Fry on, then went up and peered into the bubble.\r\n\r\nThen he knew what had happened to Captain Krotzer.\r\n\r\nThe captain sat with his shirt undone and dirty, his eyes fixed\r\nglassily to a place on the dome some twenty feet from where Bailey\r\nstood. Unkempt beard was on his face. A blaster lay on the table. The\r\nbodies of his crew lay about him.\r\n\r\nKrotzer held the radar mike, his lips moving monotonously.\r\n\r\nIt must have smelled terrible in there.\r\n\r\nSpace was the monster that had got Krotzer and the crew of the Galileo,\r\nmoving in on them with icy probings until one of them had cracked.\r\n\r\nBailey felt a hand on his shoulder. Fry had arrived. The medic gazed\r\ninto the dome. They went over and sat near DiCredico.\r\n\r\n"We may as well go in and get him," said their skipper. "Try to be easy\r\non him."\r\n\r\nMatt Bailey felt something breaking inside his chest. Maybe it would\r\ngrow back, maybe it wouldn\'t.\r\n\r\n... _They felt something breaking inside his chest in all the rooms in\r\nMinnesota and Bloomsbury and Hong Kong, and then there was a separation\r\nand they were no longer Bailey but themselves, watching a thin man\r\nstand up beside a desk._\r\n\r\n_"I am Wilson Bonner of World Tele," he said. "You have just witnessed\r\nthe world\'s first kinevision broadcast, and you may have your brains\r\nback. Practically everybody on earth tonight was Matt Bailey--although\r\nthere is really no Matt Bailey at all._\r\n\r\n_"Perhaps you expected something more pleasant from your first\r\nkinevision, and your government owes you an explanation. You are aware\r\nof the progress of space flight research. 

=== Chunk 12 ===
We have achieved planetary\r\nescape. There is wild optimism. The space ministry has been swamped,\r\nclogged, with space-ship volunteers._\r\n\r\n_"It was time for realism._\r\n\r\n_"Matt Bailey was a synthetic personality. We invented him. We fed\r\npersonality factors into a calculator, and we also fed into the\r\ncalculator some highly informed guesses about just a few of the\r\nconditions likely to be encountered in space flight._\r\n\r\n_"We used the calculator to project the neural reactions of the\r\nsynthetic person, Bailey, under the assumed conditions._\r\n\r\n_"Through kinevision, these sensations were reproduced in you._\r\n\r\n_"I need not labor the point. Space flight will be no Sunday outing.\r\nYou deserve to know that--to know it with your feelings as well as\r\nyour brains. And especially you young men should know it--you who are\r\nthinking about joining the volunteers. Frankly, we hope some of you\r\nwill not volunteer. For though there is no Matt Bailey, there will be,\r\nsomeday, soon."_\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
