His wife, a short thin woman with worried\r\neyes, watched him while he sat before the kitchen table. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
He was thin,\r\ntoo, like his wife, but tall and tough-skinned. His face, with its\r\nleather look was immobile.\r\n\r\n"Why?" asked his wife.\r\n\r\n"Good reasons," the farmer said.\r\n\r\nHe poured yellow cream into a cup of coffee. He let the cup sit on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n"Henry?" said the woman, as though she were really speaking to someone\r\nelse. She walked around the kitchen in quick aimless bird steps.\r\n\r\n"My right," said Henry. He lifted his cup, finally, tasting.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll starve."\r\n\r\n"Not likely. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Not until everybody else does, anyway."\r\n\r\nThe woman circled the room and came back to her husband. Her eyes\r\nwinked, and there were lines between them. Her fingers clutched the edge\r\nof the table. "You\'ve gone crazy," she said, as though it were a\r\nhalf-question, a half-pronouncement.\r\n\r\nThe farmer was relaxing now, leaning back in his chair. "Might have.\r\nMight have, at that."\r\n\r\n"_Why?_" she asked.\r\n\r\nThe farmer turned his coffee cup carefully. "Thing to do, is all. Each\r\nman in his own turn. This is my turn."\r\n\r\nThe woman watched him for a long time, then she sat down on a chair\r\nbeside the table. The quick, nervous movement was gone out of her, and\r\nshe sat like a frozen sparrow.\r\n\r\nThe farmer looked up and grinned. "Feels good. Just to sit here. Does\r\nwell for the back and the arms. Been working too hard."\r\n\r\n"Henry," the woman said.\r\n\r\nThe farmer tasted his coffee again. He put the cup on the table and\r\nleaned back, tapping his browned fingers. "Just in time, I\'d say. Waited\r\nany longer, it wouldn\'t have done any good. Another few years, a farmer\r\nwouldn\'t mean anything."\r\n\r\nThe woman watched him, her eyes frightened as though he might suddenly\r\ngnash his teeth or leap in the air.\r\n\r\n"Pretty soon," the farmer said, "they\'d have it all mechanical. Couldn\'t\r\nstop anything. Now," he said, smiling at his wife, "we can stop it all."\r\n\r\n"Henry, go out to the fields," the woman said.\r\n\r\n"No," Henry said, standing, stretching his thin, hard body. "I won\'t go\r\nout to the fields. Neither will August Brown nor Clyde Briggs nor Alfred\r\nSwanson. None of us. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Anywhere. Not until the food\'s been stopped long\r\nenough for people to wake up."\r\n\r\nThe farmer looked out of the kitchen window, beyond his tractor and the\r\ncow barn and the windmill. He looked at rows of strong corn, shivering\r\ntheir soft silk in the morning breeze. "We\'ll stop the corn. Stop the\r\nwheat. Stop the cattle, the hogs, the chickens."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t."\r\n\r\n"_I_ can\'t. But all of us together can."\r\n\r\n"No sense," the woman said, wagging her head. "No sense."\r\n\r\n"It\'s sense, all right. Best sense we\'ve ever had. Can\'t use an army\r\nwith no stomach. Old as the earth. Can\'t fight without food. Takes food\r\nto run a war."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll starve the two of us, that\'s all you\'ll do. Nobody else will\r\nstop work."\r\n\r\nThe farmer turned to his wife. "Yes, they will. Everywhere a farmer is\r\nthe same. He works the land. He reads the papers. He votes. He listens\r\nto the radio. He watches the television. Mostly, he works the land.\r\nAlone, with his own thoughts and ideas. He isn\'t any different in Maine\r\nthan he is in Oregon. We\'ve all stopped work. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Now. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
This morning."\r\n\r\n"How about those across the ocean? Are they stopping, too? They\'re not\r\ngoing to feed up their soldiers? To kill us if we don\'t starve first?\r\nTo--"\r\n\r\n"They stopped, too. A farmer is a farmer. Like a leaf on a tree. No\r\nmatter on what tree in what country on whose land. A leaf is a leaf. A\r\nfarmer\'s the same. A farmer is a farmer."\r\n\r\n"It won\'t work," the woman said dully.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it will."\r\n\r\n"They\'ll _make_ you work."\r\n\r\n"How? It\'s our own property."\r\n\r\n"They\'ll take it away from you."\r\n\r\n"Who\'ll work it then?"\r\n\r\nThe woman rocked in her chair, her mouth quivering. "They\'ll get\r\nsomebody."\r\n\r\nThe farmer shook his head. "Too many people doing other things, like\r\nmaking shells and guns, like sitting in fox-holes or flying planes."\r\n\r\nThe woman sat rocking, her hands together in her lap. "It won\'t work,"\r\nshe repeated.\r\n\r\n"It\'ll work," said the farmer. "Right _now_, it\'ll work. Yes, we\'ve got\r\nmilkers and shuckers, and we\'ve got hatchers for the chickens. We\'ve got\r\ntractors and combines and threshing machines. They\'re all mechanical,\r\nall right. But we don\'t have mechanical farmers, yet. The pumps, the\r\ntractors, the milkers don\'t work by themselves. In time, maybe. Not now.\r\nWe\'re still ahead of them on that. It\'ll work."\r\n\r\n"Go out to the fields, Henry," his wife said, her voice like the sound\r\nof a worn phonograph record.\r\n\r\n"No," the farmer said, taking a pipe from his overalls. "I think\r\ninstead, I\'ll just sit in the sun and watch the corn. Watch the birds on\r\ntop of the barn, maybe. I\'ll fill my pipe and sit there and smoke and\r\nwatch. And when I get sleepy, I\'ll sleep. After a while I might go see\r\nAugust Brown or Clyde Briggs or maybe Alfred Swanson. We\'ll sit and\r\ntalk, about pleasant things, peaceful things. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
We\'ll wait."\r\n\r\nThe farmer put the pipe between his teeth and walked to the door. He put\r\non his straw hat, buttoned the sleeves of his blue shirt and stepped\r\noutside.\r\n\r\nHis wife sat at the table, staring at nothing in the room.\r\n\r\nThe farmer walked across the barnyard, listening to the sound of the\r\nchickens and the sound of the breeze going through the corn. Near the\r\nbarn, he sat upon an old tree stump and filled his pipe with tobacco. He\r\nlit the pipe, cupping his hands, and sat there, smoking, the smoke\r\nspiraling up into the bright warm air.\r\n\r\nHe took his pipe from his teeth and looked at it. "Pipe of peace," he\r\nsaid, laughing inside himself.\r\n\r\nThe breeze was soft and the sun warm on his back. He sat there, smoking,\r\nfeeling the quiet of the morning, the peace of the great sky above.\r\n\r\nHe had no time to stand or to take his pipe from his mouth, when the two\r\nmen crossed the yard and lifted him up by the arms. He dropped the pipe,\r\nwhile he was dragged past the house, to the road beyond. He had no time\r\nto yell or scream, before his hat was swept from his head, the overalls\r\nand the blue shirt stripped from his body.\r\n\r\nHe had not even thought about what it was that had happened, before he\r\nwas thrust inside a white truck, with strong steel sides and with\r\ngrilled windows like those of a cell.\r\n\r\nHe was just sitting there, in the truck, without his clothes, speeding\r\naway with August Brown and Clyde Briggs and Alfred Swanson.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOutside, the sun was warm upon the earth. Chickens clucked in their\r\npens, while birds fluttered about the top of the barn. A pig squealed.\r\nThe corn rustled. And beside the farmhouse, on the ground, lay a pipe,\r\nits tobacco spilled, the last of its smoke swirling out of its bowl into\r\nthe air, disappearing.\r\n\r\nThe woman sat in the kitchen of the farmhouse and turned her head when\r\nthe door opened. She widened her eyes and caught at her throat with her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nThe sun through the doorway shone down on metallic hands and a metallic\r\nface, gleaming on the surface which the straw hat and the overalls and\r\nthe blue shirt didn\'t hide. The door snapped shut, and there was a sound\r\nof heavy metal footsteps against the kitchen floor.\r\n\r\nThe woman pressed against her chair. "Who are you?" she screamed.\r\n\r\n"Henry," said the mechanical thing.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _If Worlds of Science Fiction_ May\r\n    1953.
