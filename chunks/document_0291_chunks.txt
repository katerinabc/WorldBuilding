Fritch\r\n\r\n               Pity the poor science-fiction writer who\r\n             creates bug-eyed monsters. You only see them\r\n             in print--he may have to live with a few!...\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Imagination Stories of Science and Fantasy\r\n                              March 1952\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThat\'s not my real name up there, and in a little while you\'ll discover\r\nthe reason why. If you read my real name attached to this, you\'d think\r\nit was just another fantastic yarn I batted out and then you\'d forget\r\nit. And you\'d laugh. You\'ll probably laugh anyway--for awhile--but I\'ve\r\ngot to get this thing off my chest once and for all.\r\n\r\nI was a struggling science-fiction author at the time it began--or\r\nrather, just before it began. Nope, that\'s not right--struggling isn\'t\r\nthe word; it doesn\'t express the blood, sweat and postage stamps that\r\nwent into a creation, the hope and the futility that ran hot and cold\r\nwith each morning\'s mail, the psychological and financial insecurity\r\nthat comes to a beginner crazy enough to tackle such a field. And then,\r\nto top it off, I got a letter from Donald MacDonald.\r\n\r\nThat\'s not _his_ real name either, and in a little while you\'ll find\r\nout the reason why. He\'s one of the all-time greats in science-fiction\r\nand still is, and a fan not knowing his work would be suspected of\r\nhaving lost his marbles. So a "name" author writes me a letter. Great,\r\nhuh?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nI\'d sent MacDonald a batch of my manuscripts, humbly asking the great\r\nman to favor them with a glance if a moment ever came while he was\r\nresting a bit between dashing off novelettes. And would he kindly\r\nlet me know--frankly, honestly, without fear of injuring my delicate\r\nfeelings--what he thought of the work?\r\n\r\nHe would. And did. The letter read:\r\n\r\n    Dear Mr. ....:\r\n\r\n    I appreciate your efforts at trying to crack the stf field, but I\'m\r\n    afraid I\'ll have to disillusion you. I have read your manuscripts\r\n    with considerable care and am sorry to report that you seem to have\r\n    no talent for writing and especially none for science-fiction.\r\n\r\n    I would suggest you turn your energies to something else--saxophone\r\n    playing, stamp collecting--anything else. If you insist upon\r\n    writing, however, have you considered fillers?\r\n\r\n                                                           Best wishes,\r\n                                                      Donald MacDonald.\r\n\r\nWhat I should have done was go out into the country, and let the\r\ngathering steam blow its lid. But I didn\'t. If I\'d gotten an automobile\r\nin motion, I would have run down the nearest boy scout just to see his\r\nblood spatter. Instead, I sat down and wrote a letter to Mr. Donald\r\nMacDonald.\r\n\r\nIt was a fine letter, full of colorful phrases and split infinitives.\r\nTo hell with grammar at a time like that, I rationalized. I told him in\r\nno uncertain terms just what I thought of him and his criticisms. I\'d\r\nbe a science-fiction writer just to show him up for the incompetent he\r\nwas, I said. I guess I said a lot of things. It was a letter full of\r\nmore than fire and brimstone. It was radioactive.\r\n\r\nI mailed it. Then I had a beer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwo days later, while I was bravely punching typewriter keys in a\r\ndesperate effort to make good my boast, a small, haggard-looking fellow\r\ncame to the door and rang the bell.\r\n\r\n"We don\'t want any," I said.\r\n\r\nHe peered through the screen door and said, "I\'m MacDonald," in a\r\nnervous, uncertain voice.\r\n\r\n"MacDonald who?"\r\n\r\n"Donald MacDonald. May I come in?"\r\n\r\n"You\'re kidding. No, by God, you\'re not. You _are_ Donald MacDonald."\r\n\r\nHe smiled wanly. "May I come in? I flew all the way--"\r\n\r\n"Just to see me?"\r\n\r\n"I--er--it was no trouble. I took a _skyorie_."\r\n\r\n"A what?"\r\n\r\n"May I come in?"\r\n\r\n"Sure, sure, c\'mon in. Have a chair. Drink?"\r\n\r\n"No, thanks," he said, seating himself. "I\'m afraid I\'ve been--that\r\nis--er--No, I don\'t believe so."\r\n\r\n"I got your letter," I said, suddenly remembering. My awe at the\r\npresence of the great man was suddenly overwhelmed by a feeling of\r\n"Now, what the hell does he want?"\r\n\r\n"And I got yours," MacDonald said. "That\'s why I\'m here." He gazed at\r\nmy typewriter as though it were ready to bite him. "You didn\'t take my\r\nadvice?"\r\n\r\n"Hardly," I said, rather flippantly. "Once the bug has bitten you--"\r\n\r\n"Have you had anything accepted?"\r\n\r\nI stared at the rug, hating the man for asking. "No, not yet," I\r\nadmitted grudgingly, "but--"\r\n\r\n"Then the bug hasn\'t _really_ bitten you yet," he said. "You\'ll know it\r\nwhen he does."\r\n\r\n"I--uh--guess my letter was a bit--er--abrupt," I said, not knowing how\r\nelse to fill the silence.\r\n\r\n"You were pretty mad," he admitted, "and I don\'t blame you; I should\r\nhave known better than to tell you that way. But in this game,\r\nyou\'ve--well, you\'ve got to learn to take criticism. If your work\'s\r\nbad, admit it and throw in the towel."\r\n\r\n"And mine\'s bad?"\r\n\r\nHe shrugged, avoiding my eyes. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
"I\'m afraid so."\r\n\r\nBut the steam had been released and the period of mourning had ended,\r\nso "I\'ll improve," I told him.\r\n\r\n"You\'re wasting your time."\r\n\r\n"Possibly. What I can\'t understand, though, is why a big name in\r\nscience-fiction comes way the devil out here just to advise me to stop\r\nknocking my head against a wall."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps more than your head is at stake," he said.\r\n\r\n"What?

=== Chunk 3 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Nothing," he said hastily. For a moment his pale face held a haunted\r\nlook, and he rose, looking like a man unsure of himself. "I can\'t talk\r\nyou out of it, so I\'d better go.

=== Chunk 4 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Wait a minute. Just what did you mean by that other remark?"\r\n\r\nDonald MacDonald glanced around him as though he were afraid invisible\r\nbeings might be eavesdropping. "You really want to know the reason why?"\r\n\r\nI nodded.\r\n\r\n"Your work is good," he said seriously. "Too good. Not up to par on\r\nsome points, but in a few years you\'ll be going places. That\'s why I\r\nsneaked away from them and came here--to beg you to reconsider, to stop\r\nthis writing now, before it\'s too late."\r\n\r\n"You mean--you _can\'t_ mean--you\'re not--afraid of competition?"\r\n\r\nHe waved an annoyed hand. "Competition, hell! There\'s always room for\r\nmore. You don\'t understand," he went on, screwing his face into a look\r\nof determination. "I\'m trying to save your peace of mind, your sanity\r\nperhaps. The mind is a great and powerful thing, sometimes dangerous.\r\nAll these things--these alien creatures that a science-fiction author\r\ncreates--"\r\n\r\n"Yes?"\r\n\r\nBut he had straightened suddenly, a look of terror on a face gone\r\nashen. He went to the door like a man being pushed, fumbled for the\r\nknob. "I beg of you, for your sake, forget it," he called back. Then he\r\nwas gone.\r\n\r\nI went out on the porch but MacDonald was not in sight. I heard a\r\nstrange noise as of the flapping of great leathery wings. A shadow\r\npassed across the lawn. I looked up.\r\n\r\nNothing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next morning I got a small envelope in the mail. The letter inside\r\nread, "Enclosed is a check for your story THE MONBEAST...." I sank into\r\nthe softest chair in the world and read those wonderful, wonderful\r\nwords, and held the check in my hand and read those wonderful,\r\nwonderful figures. I was so in a trance I hardly noticed the tiny\r\ndecimal point that scampered on tiny legs across the check. I hardly\r\nfelt the small, sharp bite--but....\r\n\r\nMy first acceptance! It was incredible the exhilaration that flowed\r\nthrough me in that instant. It was like a much-needed shot of\r\nadrenaline, like cool springwater to a thirsty man. I had a check for\r\na story someone thought enough of to publish. I was an author. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
A real,\r\nlive, honest-to-goodness author with a check in my hand to prove to a\r\ncritical world that I wasn\'t a bum after all. Suddenly the world was a\r\nbig, wide, wonderful place to live in, and I loved everyone in it--even\r\nthe poor, disillusioned Donald MacDonald.\r\n\r\nBut why stop here? I thought. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
There were more checks where that came\r\nfrom. If I could sell one story, I could sell two, and then three, and\r\nfour. So I did. In a way, it was something like digging my own grave.\r\nYou don\'t understand that now, but in a little while you\'ll see the\r\nreason why.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter I had haunted the newsstand for about three months, the great day\r\ncame. THE MONBEAST was the last story in the magazine (at the time I\r\nthought they really should have featured it) and my name was misspelled\r\non the contents page, but it was a great day just the same. A day of\r\ntriumph. A day for rejoicing. I\'d had several stories accepted during\r\nthe several months\' interval, but this was the day that the fruits of\r\nmy labor became evident to the world.\r\n\r\nI walked home with a proud, firm step, casually displaying the magazine\r\nto the vast public eye, to friend and foe alike. I tried to act\r\nnonchalant, as though this were old stuff to an established writer like\r\nme. It was a day of glory, of triumph, rivaling Caesar\'s victorious\r\nmarch into Rome.\r\n\r\nThat evening I read the story over and over again, marveling at the\r\nperfection of its form, savoring the exquisite flavor of each delicate,\r\nrichly-hued, word, the uniqueness of each choice, well-turned phrase. I\r\nfell asleep with the magazine in my hand.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next morning the monbeast was sitting at the foot of my bed.\r\n\r\n"Okay, okay," it said, blinking its bug-eyes at me, "don\'t act so\r\nsurprised. MacDonald warned you, didn\'t he?"\r\n\r\n"But--but--"\r\n\r\n"Sure, I\'m real," the monbeast volunteered, scratching its scaly head\r\nwith a long-nailed finger. "That\'s the trouble with you guys. You\'re\r\nfull of imagination, but you can\'t face reality."\r\n\r\n"Where--where\'d you come from?"\r\n\r\nThe monbeast shrugged massive green shoulders. "The whole thing\'s much\r\ntoo technical for me to worry about. All I know is us BEMs exist, and\r\nwe get to your dimension via science-fiction."\r\n\r\n"That \'power of mind\' MacDonald was talking about?" I said, shuddering\r\na bit.\r\n\r\n"Something like that. Other forms of fiction deal with things native to\r\nyour world. Science-fiction regards us BEMs as real, so while we don\'t\r\nordinarily exist here, there\'s a stress created in the barrier between\r\nus, and we come through."\r\n\r\n"Then you\'re really real?"\r\n\r\n"Practically. Right now, though, you\'re the only one who can see and\r\nhear me. You haven\'t characterized me sufficiently so that the readers\r\nwill be convinced that I\'m real. But that\'s okay. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
You\'ll improve."\r\n\r\n"Thanks. But now what about you?" 

=== Chunk 8 ===
I said, trying to not appear\r\noveranxious. "Are you returning to your own dimension or are you\r\nstaying here for awhile?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe monbeast grinned, showing the eighty sharp-pointed teeth I knew it\r\npossessed. "Sorry, I\'m here to stay. I\'m your brainchild, you know, so\r\nI\'ll have to stick to you."\r\n\r\nI gulped. "Stick to me?"\r\n\r\n"Only figuratively," the monbeast said. "But I\'ll be around." He\r\ncocked a bug-eye at me and said gravely, "We\'d better get a few things\r\nstraight right from the start. One of them is that as far as you\'re\r\nconcerned, I\'m as real as that bedpost."\r\n\r\n"Real?" I tried to laugh that off, but the sound came out a little\r\nweakly. "That\'s silly. You\'re just a product of my imagination."\r\n\r\n"Am I?" the monbeast said.\r\n\r\nHe thrust the scaly face close to mine and yawned. Suddenly the room\r\nbecame a turkish bath.\r\n\r\n"Okay, okay," I said hastily, "turn it off."\r\n\r\nCoolness came, and I breathed easier as the steam dissipated.\r\n\r\n"Secondly, you\'re going to create bigger and better BEMs and make them\r\nmore convincing," the monbeast continued. "With all you writers turning\r\nus loose, we can have a swell time in this world.

=== Chunk 9 ===
"\r\n\r\n"But how can you?" I protested. "You said the readers wouldn\'t believe\r\nin you, so you don\'t exist for them."\r\n\r\n"Science-fiction is growing," the monbeast said. "Everyday more people\r\nare getting to realize that there is more to the world than those\r\nthings they see around them. They believe what they read in love\r\nstories and detective stories. Science-fiction is next."\r\n\r\n"Suppose I don\'t want to create more BEMs?" I said. "Suppose I take up\r\nsaxophone playing or something and leave science-fiction alone."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t stop writing it now, any more than a true fan can stop\r\nreading it. The bug has bitten you." He smiled a piano keyboard of\r\nteeth and continued, "Besides, I could be obliged to--er--inspire you\r\njust a bit. But you just work along with me, and we\'ll both do fine."\r\n\r\nSo we did.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe monbeast isn\'t such a bad fellow after all, once you get to know\r\nhim. Neither are the other BEMs hanging around my house. Oh, yes, there\r\nare others, lots of them. Hanging from the rafters. Under chairs. In\r\ncoffee cups. Everywhere. It\'s an occupational hazard, you know.\r\n\r\nChances are, though, you wouldn\'t be able to see them--unless you\'re a\r\nreal gone science-fiction fan, and even then maybe not. But someday you\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nSomeday you\'ll be sitting in your favorite chair reading your favorite\r\nscience-fiction magazine, and you\'ll look up....\r\n\r\nMaybe it\'ll be sitting on the desk beside you, running one of four\r\nhands through a nest of snakes on its scaly head. Maybe it\'ll be only\r\nan inch tall and perched on the piano watching you. Maybe at first\r\nit\'ll be just a warm, dank breath on the back of your neck.\r\n\r\nNo telling _when_ it\'ll be either. Maybe next year, next month;\r\ntomorrow. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
Who knows--perhaps even now.\r\n\r\nHere\'s a little tip. When you lay down this magazine, turn around\r\nslowly. Have you ever had the feeling that something was going on\r\nbehind your back but when you turned around you saw nothing? What\'s\r\nthat? You think maybe you\'ve got that feeling right now?\r\n\r\nListen, on second thought, now that you know, maybe you better not turn\r\naround. Take this as a gag. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
A nice big laugh. You\'ll be a lot better\r\noff that way.\r\n\r\nWhat you don\'t know can\'t hurt you....\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
