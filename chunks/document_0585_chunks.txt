The\r\nfifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take\r\nto get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright\r\nsearched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This\r\nprojected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value\r\nper text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2\r\nmillion dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text\r\nfiles per month, or 384 more Etexts in 1998 for a total of 1500+\r\nIf these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the\r\ntotal should reach over 150 billion Etexts given away.\r\n\r\nThe Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext\r\nFiles by the December 31, 2001.

Hers had broken down, and unless she\r\ncould borrow another, she would fail her midterm project.  

=== Chunk 4 ===
There was\r\nno one she dared ask, except Dan.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis put Dan in a dilemma.  He had to help her--but if he lent her his\r\ncomputer, she might read his books.  Aside from the fact that you\r\ncould go to prison for many years for letting someone else read your\r\nbooks, the very idea shocked him at first.  Like everyone, he had been\r\ntaught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and\r\nwrong--something that only pirates would do.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd there wasn\'t much chance that the SPA--the Software Protection\r\nAuthority--would fail to catch him.  In his software class, Dan had\r\nlearned that each book had a copyright monitor that reported when and\r\nwhere it was read, and by whom, to Central Licensing.  (They used this\r\ninformation to catch reading pirates, but also to sell personal\r\ninterest profiles to retailers.)  The next time his computer was\r\nnetworked, Central Licensing would find out.  He, as computer owner,\r\nwould receive the harshest punishment--for not taking pains to prevent\r\nthe crime.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, Lissa did not necessarily intend to read his books.  She\r\nmight want the computer only to write her midterm.  But Dan knew she\r\ncame from a middle-class family and could hardly afford the tuition,\r\nlet alone her reading fees.  Reading his books might be the only way\r\nshe could graduate.  He understood this situation; he himself had had\r\nto borrow to pay for all the research papers he read.  (10% of those\r\nfees went to the researchers who wrote the papers; since Dan aimed for\r\nan academic career, he could hope that his own research papers, if\r\nfrequently referenced, would bring in enough to repay this loan.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLater on, Dan would learn there was a time when anyone could go to the\r\nlibrary and read journal articles, and even books, without having to\r\npay.  There were independent scholars who read thousands of pages\r\nwithout government library grants.  But in the 1990s, both commercial\r\nand nonprofit journal publishers had begun charging fees for access.\r\nBy 2047, libraries offering free public access to scholarly literature\r\nwere a dim memory.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were ways, of course, to get around the SPA and Central\r\nLicensing.  They were themselves illegal.  Dan had had a classmate in\r\nsoftware, Frank Martucci, who had obtained an illicit debugging tool,\r\nand used it to skip over the copyright monitor code when reading\r\nbooks.  But he had told too many friends about it, and one of them\r\nturned him in to the SPA for a reward (students deep in debt were\r\neasily tempted into betrayal).  In 2047, Frank was in prison, not for\r\npirate reading, but for possessing a debugger.\r\n\r\n\r\nDan would later learn that there was a time when anyone could have\r\ndebugging tools.  There were even free debugging tools available on CD\r\nor downloadable over the net.  But ordinary users started using them\r\nto bypass copyright monitors, and eventually a judge ruled that this\r\nhad become their principal use in actual practice.  This meant they\r\nwere illegal; the debuggers\' developers were sent to prison.\r\n\r\n\r\nProgrammers still needed debugging tools, of course, but debugger\r\nvendors in 2047 distributed numbered copies only, and only to\r\nofficially licensed and bonded programmers.  The debugger Dan used in\r\nsoftware class was kept behind a special firewall so that it could be\r\nused only for class exercises.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was also possible to bypass the copyright monitors by installing a\r\nmodified system kernel.  Dan would eventually find out about the free\r\nkernels, even entire free operating systems, that had existed around\r\nthe turn of the century.  But not only were they illegal, like\r\ndebuggers--you could not install one if you had one, without knowing\r\nyour computer\'s root password.  And neither the FBI nor Microsoft\r\nSupport would tell you that.\r\n\r\n\r\nDan concluded that he couldn\'t simply lend Lissa his computer.  But he\r\ncouldn\'t refuse to help her, because he loved her.  Every chance to\r\nspeak with her filled him with delight.  And that she chose him to ask\r\nfor help, that could mean she loved him too.\r\n\r\n\r\nDan resolved the dilemma by doing something even more unthinkable--he\r\nlent her the computer, and told her his password.  This way, if Lissa\r\nread his books, Central Licensing would think he was reading them.  It\r\nwas still a crime, but the SPA would not automatically find out about\r\nit.  They would only find out if Lissa reported him.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, if the school ever found out that he had given Lissa his\r\nown password, it would be curtains for both of them as students,\r\nregardless of what she had used it for.  School policy was that any\r\ninterference with their means of monitoring students\' computer use was\r\ngrounds for disciplinary action.  It didn\'t matter whether you did\r\nanything harmful--the offense was making it hard for the\r\nadministrators to check on you.  They assumed this meant you were\r\ndoing something else forbidden, and they did not need to know what it\r\nwas.\r\n\r\n\r\nStudents were not usually expelled for this--not directly.  Instead\r\nthey were banned from the school computer systems, and would\r\ninevitably fail all their classes.\r\n\r\n\r\nLater, Dan would learn that this kind of university policy started\r\nonly in the 1980s, when university students in large numbers began\r\nusing computers.  Previously, universities maintained a different\r\napproach to student discipline; they punished activities that were\r\nharmful, not those that merely raised suspicion.\r\n\r\n\r\nLissa did not report Dan to the SPA.  His decision to help her led to\r\ntheir marriage, and also led them to question what they had been\r\ntaught about piracy as children.  The couple began reading about the\r\nhistory of copyright, about the Soviet Union and its restrictions on\r\ncopying, and even the original United States Constitution.  They moved\r\nto Luna, where they found others who had likewise gravitated away from\r\nthe long arm of the SPA.  When the Tycho Uprising began in 2062, the\r\nuniversal right to read soon became one of its central aims.\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthor\'s Note\r\n\r\n\r\nThe right to read is a battle being fought today.  Although it may\r\ntake 50 years for our present way of life to fade into obscurity, most\r\nof the specific laws and practices described above have already been\r\nproposed--either by the Clinton Administration or by publishers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is one exception: the idea that the FBI and Microsoft will keep\r\nthe root passwords for personal computers.  This is an extrapolation\r\nfrom the Clipper chip and similar Clinton Administration key-escrow\r\nproposals, together with a long-term trend: computer systems are\r\nincreasingly set up to give absentee operators control over the people\r\nactually using the computer system.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe SPA, which actually stands for Software Publisher\'s Association,\r\nis not today an official police force.  Unofficially, it acts like\r\none.  It invites people to inform on their coworkers and friends; like\r\nthe Clinton Administration, it advocates a policy of collective\r\nresponsibility whereby computer owners must actively enforce copyright\r\nor be punished.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe SPA is currently threatening small Internet service providers,\r\ndemanding they permit the SPA to monitor all users.  Most ISPs\r\nsurrender when threatened, because they cannot afford to fight back in\r\ncourt.

At least one\r\nISP, Community ConneXion in Oakland CA, refused the demand and was\r\nactually sued.  The SPA is said to have\r\ndropped this suit recently, but they are sure to continue the campaign\r\nin various other ways.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe university security policies described above are not imaginary.\r\nFor example, a computer at one Chicago-area university prints this\r\nmessage when you log in (quotation marks are in the original):\r\n\r\n\r\n"This system is for the use of authorized users only.  Individuals using\r\nthis computer system without authority or in the excess of their authority\r\nare subject to having all their activities on this system monitored and\r\nrecorded by system personnel.  In the course of monitoring individuals\r\nimproperly using this system or in the course of system maintenance, the\r\nactivities of authorized user may also be monitored.  Anyone using this\r\nsystem expressly consents to such monitoring and is advised that if such\r\nmonitoring reveals possible evidence of illegal activity or violation of\r\nUniversity regulations system personnel may provide the evidence of such\r\nmonitoring to University authorities and/or law enforcement officials."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is an interesting approach to the Fourth Amendment: pressure most\r\neveryone to agree, in advance, to waive their rights under it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The administration\'s "White Paper": Information Infrastructure Task\r\n       Force, Intellectual Property and the National Information\r\n       Infrastructure: The Report of the Working Group on Intellectual\r\n       Property Rights (1995).\r\n\r\n  An explanation of the White Paper:\r\n       The Copyright Grab, Pamela Samuelson, Wired, Jan. 1996\r\n\r\n  Sold Out,\r\n       James Boyle, New York Times, 31 March 1996\r\n\r\n  Public Data or Private Data, Washington Post, 4 Nov 1996\r\n  Union for the Public Domain--a new organization which aims to resist\r\n  and reverse the overextension of intellectual property powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Other Texts to Read\r\nReturn to GNU\'s home page [www.gnu.org]\r\n\r\nFSF &amp; GNU inquiries &amp; questions to\r\ngnu@gnu.org.\r\nOther ways to contact the FSF.\r\n\r\nComments on these web pages to\r\nwebmasters@www.gnu.org,\r\nsend other questions to\r\ngnu@gnu.org.\r\n\r\nCopyright 1996 Richard Stallman\r\n\r\nVerbatim copying and distribution of this entire article is\r\npermitted in any medium, provided this notice is preserved.\r\n\r\nUpdated:\r\n\r\n12 Feb markg\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Right to Read - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation (FSF)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
