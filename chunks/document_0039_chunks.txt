Perhaps they will carry folks\r\n    down the highways at ninety miles an hour in perfect safety. But\r\n    picking up a hitch-hiker will still be as dangerous as it is today._\r\n\r\n HARD\r\n GUY\r\n\r\n By H. B. CARLETON\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was standing at the side of the glassite super-highway, his arm\r\nhalf-raised, thumb pointed in the same direction as that of the\r\napproaching rocket car. Ordinarily Frederick Marden would have passed a\r\nhitch-hiker without stopping, but there was something in the bearing and\r\nappearance of this one that caused him to apply his brakes.\r\n\r\nMarden opened the door next to the vacant seat beside him.\r\n\r\n"Going my way?" he asked.\r\n\r\nA pair of steady, unsmiling blue eyes looked him over. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
"Yeah.

=== Chunk 4 ===
"\r\n\r\n"All right, then. Hop in."\r\n\r\nThe hitch-hiker took his time. He slid into the seat with casual\r\ndeliberateness and slammed the car door shut. The rocket car got under\r\nway once more.\r\n\r\nThey rode in silence for half a mile or so. Finally Marden glanced\r\nquestioningly at his companion\'s expressionless profile.\r\n\r\n"Where are you headed for?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Dentonville." He spoke from the corner of his mouth, without turning\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. That\'s the next town, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Yeah."\r\n\r\nNot very communicative, reflected Marden, noticing the rather ragged\r\ncondition of the other\'s celo-lex clothing.\r\n\r\n"Have much trouble getting rides?"\r\n\r\nThe passenger turned his head, his blue eyes without emotion.\r\n\r\n"Yeah. Most guys are leery about pickin\' up hitch-hikers. Scared they\'ll\r\nget robbed."\r\n\r\nMarden pursed his lips, nodded.\r\n\r\n"Something to that, all right. I\'m usually pretty careful myself; but I\r\nfigured you looked okay."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t always tell by looks," was the calm reply. "\'Course us guys\r\nmostly pick out some guy with a swell atomic-mobile if we\'re goin\' to\r\npull a stick-up. When we see a old heap like this one there\'s usually\r\nnot enough dough to make it pay."\r\n\r\nMarden felt his jaw drop.\r\n\r\n"Say, you sound, like you go in for that sort of thing! I\'m telling you\r\nright now, I haven\'t enough cash on me to make it worth your while. I\'m\r\njust a salesman, trying to get along."\r\n\r\n"You got nothin\' to worry about," his passenger assured him. "Stick-ups\r\nain\'t my racket."\r\n\r\nAn audible sigh of relief escaped Marden.\r\n\r\n"I\'m certainly glad to hear that! What is your--er--racket, anyway?"\r\n\r\nThe blue eyes frosted over.\r\n\r\n"Look, chum, sometimes it ain\'t exactly healthy to ask questions like\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"Pardon me," Marden said hastily. "I didn\'t mean anything. It\'s none of\r\nmy business, of course."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe calm eyes flicked over his contrite expression.\r\n\r\n"Skip it, pal. You look like a right guy. I\'ll put you next to\r\nsomethin\'. Only keep your lip buttoned, see?

=== Chunk 5 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Oh, absolutely."\r\n\r\n"I\'m Mike Eagen--head of the Strato Rovers."\r\n\r\n"No!" Marden was plainly awed. "The Strato Rovers, eh? I\'ve heard of\r\nthem, all right.

=== Chunk 6 ===
"\r\n\r\nThe other nodded complacently.\r\n\r\n"Yeah. We\'re about the toughest mob this side of Mars. We don\'t bother\r\nhonest people, though. We get ours from the crooks and racketeers. They\r\ncan\'t squeal to the Interplanetary Police."\r\n\r\n"There\'s a lot in what you say," agreed Marden. "And of course that puts\r\nyour ... mob in the Robin Hood class."\r\n\r\n"Robin Hood--nuts! That guy was a dope! Runnin\' around with bows and\r\narrows. Why, we got a mystery ray that paralyzes anybody that starts up\r\nwith us. They\'re all right when it wears off, but by that time we get\r\naway."\r\n\r\nMarden was properly impressed.\r\n\r\n"A mystery ray! With a weapon like that, you should be able to walk into\r\na bank and clean it out without any trouble."\r\n\r\nHis passenger\'s lips curled.\r\n\r\n"I told you, we don\'t bother honest people. We even help the S.P.\r\nsometimes. Right now we\'re workin\' with the Earth-Mars G-men in roundin\'\r\nup a gang of fifth-columnists that are plannin\' on takin\' over the\r\ngov\'ment. They\'re led by the Black Hornet. This Black Hornet goes around\r\npretendin\' like he\'s a big business man, but he\'s really a internatural\r\nspy."\r\n\r\n"A--what?"\r\n\r\n"A internatural spy," repeated Marden\'s companion, shortly. "The E-M\r\nG-men say he\'s the most dangerous man in the country. But he won\'t last\r\nlong with the Strato Rovers on his trail."\r\n\r\nMarden nodded.\r\n\r\n"I can believe that. Tell me, Eagen, what are you doing out here around\r\na small Earth town like Dentonville?"\r\n\r\n"The gov\'ment\'s buildin\' some kind of a ammunition place near here, and\r\nI understand the Black Hornet\'s figurin\' on wreckin\' everything. \'Course\r\nhe won\'t get away with it."\r\n\r\nScattered plasticade houses on either side of the road indicated they\r\nhad reached the outskirts of Dentonville. Mike Eagen pointed ahead to a\r\nsmall white house set back among a cluster of trees.\r\n\r\n"There\'s where I\'m holed up. Drop me off in front."\r\n\r\nA young woman in a faded blue satin-glass house-dress was standing at\r\nthe gate of the white picket fence. She watched in silence as the\r\npassenger stepped from the rocket car and lifted his hand to the driver\r\nin careless farewell.\r\n\r\n"Thanks for the lift, chum," said Mike Eagen.\r\n\r\n"Not at all," replied Marden. "Glad to have been of service to Mike\r\nEagen."\r\n\r\nThe woman smiled to him.\r\n\r\n"He\'s told you his name, I see."\r\n\r\nMarden lifted his hat.\r\n\r\n"Indeed he has."\r\n\r\n"Michael is all right," she said. "I do think, though, that he reads too\r\nmany Buck Gordon Interplanetary comic books for a boy of eleven."\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ April 1956 and was\r\n    first published in _Amazing Stories_ November 1942.
