Blackness engulfed him in a wave of agony.\r\n\r\nHe was not sure exactly when the possibility of opening his eyes\r\noccurred to him. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
Vaguely, he could sense--"remember" was too\r\ndefinite--much tugging and hauling upon his supine body. It doubtless\r\nseemed justifiable, but he flinched from recalling more clearly that\r\nwhich must have been so extremely unpleasant.\r\n\r\nGently, now, he tried rolling his head a few inches right, then left.\r\nWhen it hurt only one-tenth as much as he feared, he let his eyes\r\nopen.\r\n\r\n"Hel-lo!" rasped the bulbous creature squatting beside his pallet.\r\n\r\nCharlie shut his eyes quickly, and very tightly.\r\n\r\nSomething with a dampish, spongy tip, probably one of the grape-red\r\ntentacles he had glimpsed, prodded his shoulder.\r\n\r\n"_Hel-lo!_" insisted the scratchy voice.\r\n\r\nCharlie peeped warily, was trapped at it, and opened his eyes\r\nresignedly.\r\n\r\n"Where\'n\'ell am I?" he inquired.\r\n\r\nIt sounded very trite, even in his confused condition. Sections of the\r\ndark red skin before him, especially on the barrel-shaped belly,\r\nquivered as he spoke.\r\n\r\n"Surely," grated the remarkable voice, "you remember something?"\r\n\r\n"The crash!" gasped Charlie, sitting up abruptly.\r\n\r\nHe held his breath, awaiting the knifing pain it seemed natural to\r\nexpect. When he felt none, he cautiously fingered his ribs, and then a\r\nhorrid thought prompted him to wiggle his bare toes. Everything seemed\r\nto be in place.\r\n\r\nHe lay in a small room, on a thin pallet of furs. Floor and walls of\r\nslick, ocher clay reflected the bright outside light pouring through a\r\nwide doorway.\r\n\r\n"What\'s all the sand?" he demanded, squinting at the heatwaves\r\noutside.\r\n\r\n"You do not recognize it? Look again, Earthman!"\r\n\r\n_Earthman!_ thought Charlie. _It must be real: I can still see him.\r\nWhat a whack on the head I must have got!_\r\n\r\n"You are in pain?" asked the creature solicitously.\r\n\r\n"Oh ... no. Just ... I can\'t remember. The crash ... and then--"\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes. You have not been conscious for some time." His reddish host\r\nrippled upward to stand more or less erect upon three thick tentacles.\r\n"Even with us, memory is slow after shock. And you may be uneasy in\r\nthe lighter gravity."\r\n\r\n_Light gravity!_ reflected Charlie. _This can only mean--MARS! Sure!\r\nThat must be it--I was piloting a rocket and cracked up somewhere on\r\nMars._\r\n\r\nIt felt right to him. He decided that the rest of his memory would\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\n"Are you able to rise?" asked the other, extending a helpful\r\ntentacle.\r\n\r\nThe Earthman managed to haul himself stiffly to his feet.\r\n\r\n"Say, my name is Holmes," he introduced himself dizzily.\r\n\r\n"I am Kho Theki. In your language, learned years since from other\r\nspacemen, I might say \'Fiery Canalman.\'"\r\n\r\n"_Has_ to be Mars," muttered Charlie under his breath. "What a bump!\r\nWhen can you show me what\'s left of the ship?"\r\n\r\n"There will be no time," answered the Martian.\r\n\r\nBunches of small muscles twitched here and there across the front of\r\nhis round, pudgy head. Charlie was getting used to the single eye,\r\nhalf the size of an orange and not much duller. With imagination, the\r\nvarious lumps and organs surrounding it might be considered a face.\r\n\r\n"The priestesses will lead the crowd here," predicted Kho. "They know\r\nI took an Earthman, and I fear they have finished with the others.

=== Chunk 3 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Finished with--_What_?" demanded the Earthman, shaking his head in\r\nhopes of clearing it enough to figure out what was wrong.\r\n\r\n"It has been an extremely dry season." Kho rippled his tentacles and\r\nmoved lissomely to the doorway, assuming a grotesquely furtive posture\r\nas he peered out. "The people are maddened by the drought. The will be\r\naroused to sacrifice you to the Canal Gods, like the others who\r\nsurvived."\r\n\r\n"Canal gods!" croaked Charlie. "This can\'t be right! 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Aren\'t you\r\ncivilized here? I can\'t be the only Earthman they\'ve seen!"\r\n\r\n"It is true that Earthmen are perfectly safe at most times."\r\n\r\n"But the laws! The earth consul--"\r\n\r\nKho snapped the tip of a tentacle at him.\r\n\r\n"The canals are low. You can feel the heat and dryness for yourself.\r\nThe crowds are inflamed by temple prophecies. And then, your ship,\r\nflaming down from the skies--"\r\n\r\nHe snapped all this tentacle tips at once.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom somewhere outside, a threatening murmur became audible. It was an\r\nunholy blend of rasping shouts and shriller chanting, punctuated by\r\nnotes of a brassy gong. As Charlie listened, the volume rose\r\nnoticeably.\r\n\r\nKho reached out with one tentacle and wrapped six inches about the\r\nEarthman\'s wrist. When he plunged through the doorway, Charlie\r\nperforce went right with him.\r\n\r\nWhipping around a corner of the hut, he had time for a quick squint at\r\nthe chanters. Kho alone had looked weirdly alien. Two hundred like\r\nhim--!\r\n\r\nLed by a dozen bulgy figures in streaming robes, masked and decorated\r\nin brass, the natives were swarming over the sand toward the\r\nfugitives. They had evidently been busy. Above a distant cluster of\r\nlow buildings, a column of smoke spiraled upward suggestively.\r\n\r\nKho led the way at a flowing gallop over a sandstone ridge and down a\r\nlong slope toward what looked like the junction of two gullies.\r\n\r\n"The canal," he wheezed. "With luck, we may find a boat."\r\n\r\nA frenzied screech went up as the mob topped the ridge and regained\r\nsight of them. Charlie, having all he could do to breathe in the thin\r\nair, tried to shake his wrist loose. Now that they were descending the\r\nslope, he saw where the water was. They slid down a four-foot drop in\r\na cloud of fine, choking dust, and were faced by several puntlike\r\ncraft stranded on the mudflat beyond. The water was fifty feet\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\n"We should have gone down-stream," said Kho, "but we can wade."\r\n\r\nTheir momentum carried them several steps into the mud before Charlie\r\nrealized how wrong that was. Then, as they floundered about to regain\r\nthe solid bank, it became apparent that they would never reach it in\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n"They are catching us," rasped Kho.\r\n\r\nThe howling crowd was scarcely a hundred yards away. The heat waves\r\nshimmered above the reddish desert sand until the Martians were\r\nblurred before Charlie\'s burning eyes. His feet churned the clinging\r\nmud, and he felt as if he were running in a dream.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry you\'re in it, too," he panted.\r\n\r\n"It does not matter. I act as I must."\r\n\r\nThe Earthman rubbed sweat from his eyes with the back of a muddy\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n"Everything is wrong," he mumbled. "I still can\'t remember cracking up\r\nthe ship. Why did I always want to be a rocket pilot? Well ... I made\r\nmy bed!"\r\n\r\nThe oncoming figures wavered and blurred in the heat. Kho emitted a\r\ngrating sound reminiscent of an Earthly chuckle.\r\n\r\n"As do all you mortals--who finally have to lie in them," he rasped.\r\n"I will tell you now, since I can carry this episode little farther.\r\nYou have never piloted a spaceship."\r\n\r\nCharlie gaped at him incredulously.\r\n\r\n"You ... you ... what about the wreck?"\r\n\r\n"It was a truck that hit you, Charles Holmes. You have no more sense\r\nthan to be crossing the street with your nose in a magazine just\r\npurchased on the corner."\r\n\r\nWith some dulled, creeping, semi-detached facet of his mind, Charlie\r\nnoted that the running figures still floated above the sand without\r\nactually drawing near.\r\n\r\n"Are you--Do you mean I\'m ... d-d-d--?

=== Chunk 5 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Of course you are," grated Kho amiably. "And in view of certain\r\nactions during your life, there will be quite a period of--shall we\r\nsay--probation. When I was assigned to you, your reading habits\r\nsuggested an amusing series of variations. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
You cannot know how dull it\r\nis to keep frustrating the same old dreams!"\r\n\r\n"Amusing?" repeated Charlie, beyond caring about the whimper in his\r\ntone.\r\n\r\nThe mob was dissolving into thin smoke, and the horizon was shrinking.\r\n\r\nKbo himself was altering into something redder of skin but equipped\r\nwith a normal number of limbs, discounting the barbed tail. The\r\nconstant heat of the "desert" began, at last, to seem explicable.\r\n\r\n"For me a great amusement," grinned Kho, displaying hideous tusks.\r\n"Next time, I\'ll be a Venusian. You will lose again. Then we can visit\r\nother planets, and stars ... oh, we shall see a lot of each other!"\r\n\r\nHe cheerfully polished one horn with a clawed finger.\r\n\r\n"_You_ won\'t enjoy it!" he promised.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
