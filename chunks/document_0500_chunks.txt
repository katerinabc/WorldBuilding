But when he finally emerged the world he\r\n          knew was gone. And it had left him with a strange--\r\n\r\n                              INHERITANCE\r\n\r\n                          By Edward W.

It shone as a tiny island of life in a sea of death. It shone\r\nas a symbol of His mercy.\r\n\r\nMartin stood swaying, staring wide-eyed at that wonderful light and\r\nletting its image sink deep into his vision. His eyes lidded as\r\nconsciousness faded for an instant, then opened.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve almost made it," he gasped. "We\'ve almost made it, Sandy, you\r\nand me and the pup!"\r\n\r\nHis hand passed tenderly over the puppy, a soft, hairy ball of living\r\nwarmth cradled in his arm. And from out of the darkness at his feet\r\ncame a feeble bark.\r\n\r\nMartin choked on the ancient, tomb-stale air. "We can\'t stop now,\r\nSandy," he wheezed. "We\'re almost there, almost at the entrance!"\r\n\r\nHe shuffled forward over the cold stone floor of the little cave, the\r\nthick, dead air a solid thing, a wall that pressed him back, back, back.\r\n\r\nBut the light grew larger, expanding like a balloon, and suddenly\r\nthere was a skittering of dog-paws over stone and a joyous, frantic\r\nbarking.\r\n\r\n"That\'s right, Sandy, go ahead. Breathe that air, that fresh air!"\r\n\r\nMartin staggered once, his lean, tall body thudding against sharp rock\r\nin the side of the cave. Then a draft of air blew cool and fresh into\r\nhis face, and a strength returned to him.\r\n\r\nAbruptly, he was at the source of the light, at the cave\'s entrance, a\r\nhole barely large enough for him to squeeze through. The blinding light\r\nof day fell upon him like a gigantic, crashing sea wave. He closed his\r\naching eyes and fell to the side of the rock-strewn hill, sucking the\r\nclean sweet air deep into his lungs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt length he sat up, holding the pup in his arms. "Two days in that\r\nhole of hell," he murmured, "and it\'s all your fault. A month old, and\r\nyou have to start exploring caves."\r\n\r\nHe cocked his head. "Still, I guess it\'s partly my fault. After all, I\r\ngot lost, too."\r\n\r\nSandy, a black and white fox terrier, barked impatiently.\r\n\r\n"Okay, Sandy, okay. We\'ll go home.

=== Chunk 2 ===
"\r\n\r\nShakily, Martin rose. His mind was clear now, the fogginess washed away\r\nby the cool morning air. There was only hunger, that great gnawing\r\nhunger, and thirst that made his throat and mouth seem as dry as\r\nancient parchment.\r\n\r\nAs he stood overlooking the valley below with its green fields and\r\nlittle groves of trees, a realization came to him. The world wasn\'t\r\nso bad after all! Up to this moment, he\'d almost hated the world\r\nwith its wars, its threats of mass destruction, its warnings of\r\natomic dusts and plagues that could wipe out humanity within an hour.\r\nHe\'d most certainly hated the cities with their blaring, rumbling\r\nautomobile-monsters, with their mad rushing, their greedy, frantic,\r\nsenseless, superficial living that was really not living at all.\r\n\r\nThat was why he had chosen to live in the hill country, on the\r\noutskirts of the village, raising his few vegetables and making a trip\r\nevery few days to the village store to purchase other necessities with\r\nhis pension check from World War II.\r\n\r\nBut now, he realized, it was good to be alive and to be a part of the\r\ngreen, growing things of Earth.\r\n\r\nSandy barked again.\r\n\r\n"Okay, okay, Sandy. We\'ll go.

=== Chunk 3 ===
"\r\n\r\nBut Sandy came sidling up to him now, tail between his legs. His\r\nbarking faded to a low, shrill whimper.\r\n\r\n"Sandy! What\'s the matter? What\'s wrong?"\r\n\r\nEven the whimpering ceased, and there was silence. Martin stared at\r\nthe dog, not understanding. To him came a _feeling_. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Something _was_\r\nwrong. A nameless fear rose within him, but the cause of that fear was\r\nintangible, locked just below the surface of consciousness.\r\n\r\nHe took the fear, crushed it, pushed it back into the caverns of his\r\nmind that held only forgotten things. "Nothing\'s wrong," he declared\r\nboldly. "We\'re just tired and hungry, that\'s all."\r\n\r\nHe strode down the quiet hillside toward the broad highway that\r\nstretched across the valley. He sang:\r\n\r\n    "We\'re happy, so happy,\r\n    Don\'t want to reach a star;\r\n    We\'re happy, always happy,\r\n    Just the way we are."\r\n\r\nStrange about that tune, he thought. He hated popular music, but in\r\na regrettable moment of optimism he\'d once purchased a second-hand\r\nbattery video. After a three-day saturation with tooth paste and soap\r\ncommercials he\'d consigned the monstrosity to a remote corner of the\r\nwoods, but that tune--of all the dubious products of civilization--had\r\nsomehow stuck in his memory.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he stopped singing, as if some inexplicable pressure had\r\nseized his throat, stopping the flow of words. It was quiet--so\r\nincredibly, alarmingly, terrifyingly quiet. Just ahead of him was the\r\nhighway, its gray smooth ribbon clearly visible through a thin wall of\r\nelms. But there was no swish-swish of speeding cars.\r\n\r\nAnd there were no bird twitterings and no insect hummings and no\r\nskitterings of squirrels at the bases of trees and no droning of\r\ngyro-planes. There was only silence.\r\n\r\nHe broke out onto the highway which was dotted with cars, and the cars\r\nwere motionless. Some of them were crushed, charred wrecks on the side\r\nof the road; some had collided in the center of the road to become ugly\r\nlittle mountains of twisted metal, and others were simply parked. But\r\nall were motionless.\r\n\r\n"Come on, Sandy. Something\'s happened!"\r\n\r\nSandy wouldn\'t come. He arched his trembling body across Martin\'s legs,\r\nwhimpering. Martin picked him up. Sandy in one arm, the drowsy-eyed pup\r\nin the other, he walked to the nearest car, which appeared undamaged.\r\n\r\nThere were three occupants. A man, a woman, a girl-child, and they were\r\nas if sleeping. No wounds, no discolorations were on their flesh. But\r\ntheir flesh was cold, cold, and there were no heart beats. They were\r\ndead.\r\n\r\n"We--We won\'t go home yet," Martin said softly. "We\'ll go to the\r\nvillage."\r\n\r\nHe walked. He walked past a hundred, a thousand silent cars with silent\r\noccupants, past green meadows that were dotted with silent, fallen\r\ncattle and sheep and horses.\r\n\r\nThere was a new fear within him now, but even greater than the fear was\r\na numbness that like a sleep-producing drug had dulled mind and vision\r\nand hearing. He walked stiffly, automatically. He was afraid to think\r\nand reason, for thought and reason could bring only--madness.\r\n\r\n"At the village we\'ll find out what happened," he mumbled.\r\n\r\nAt the village he found out--nothing. Because there, too, was only a\r\nsilence and the white, still people.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps in the city--" he murmured. "Yes, the city."\r\n\r\nThe City was 20 miles away, and he selected an automobile, one in which\r\nthere were no still people. It had been a long time since he\'d driven,\r\nnearly ten years, but after a few moments of fumbling, remembrance\r\ncame easily. With Sandy and the pup on the front seat beside him, he\r\ndrove....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe City was as empty as an ancient skull. There was no life and no\r\nreminder of life. There were no still people and no automobiles and no\r\nmovement and no sound. The towering white office buildings, the broad\r\navenues, the theatres, the parks--all seemed hollow and unreal, like a\r\ndesert mirage that would dissolve into nothingness at the whispering\r\ntouch of a breeze.\r\n\r\nMartin mumbled, "I reckon, Sandy, that everybody left the City. They\r\nheaded for the country. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
That\'s why we passed so many cars."\r\n\r\nHe spied the office of _The Times_. "Maybe we can find out something in\r\nthere," he said. "Come on, Sandy. Pup, you stay here."\r\n\r\nHe parked the car and strode into the building, past desks, cabinets,\r\ntypewriters, stacked bundles of newspapers.\r\n\r\nThen he saw the man. He was one of the silent men, sprawled back in a\r\nchair, a typewriter before him. He had been writing, evidently, for one\r\nstiff, white hand was still poised over the keys.\r\n\r\nMartin read the typewritten words aloud:\r\n\r\n"The enemy had apparently underestimated the power of the odorless,\r\ntasteless gas. A Nitrogen compound of extreme volutility, it has\r\nreached virtually every inch of the Earth. The enemy is destroyed as we\r\nare destroyed. Gas masks and air filters have proved useless. The gas\r\nis highly unstable and should disintegrate within 48 hours, yet because\r\nof the suddenness of the attack, we can conclude only that humanity\r\nis--" The message broke off.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the newsroom was like a tomb, a burial of all mankind\'s\r\naccomplishments and frustrations, his good-doings and evil-doings. Here\r\ninto this room had flowed, ceaseless as a river, the stories of man\'s\r\nlove, hate, struggle, fear, grasping, success, and disappointment. Side\r\nby side they lay in the labyrinth of files, the stories of Mrs. Smith\'s\r\ndivorce and a dictator\'s defeat, the sagas of a child losing a pet and\r\na scientist discovering a star. All equal now, as skeletons of great\r\nmen and little men are equal, all buried in steel drawers and sealed by\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nMartin looked at the stiffened figure of the reporter. "I wonder\r\nwhy you stayed," he mused. "I wonder why you didn\'t flee like the\r\nothers. Maybe, maybe you wanted to write the _last_ news story ever\r\nwritten--and the most important one. Yes, I reckon that was it.

=== Chunk 6 ===
"\r\n\r\nSlowly, Martin walked out of the building and slid into the car. Sandy\r\nwelcomed him with a joy-filled barking and tail-wagging and tried to\r\nlick his face, and the pup attempted to waddle across his legs.\r\n\r\n"No, Sandy, don\'t." He stared unseeingly through the windshield.\r\n"Everybody\'s gone, Sandy, everybody on Earth, except me." His eyes\r\nwidened slightly. "Course, there _might_ be somebody else, somewhere.\r\nThe gas never got to us in the cave. Maybe somebody else escaped,\r\nsomehow."\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. "Nope, no use hoping for that. Odds\'d be a thousand\r\nto one \'gainst my finding \'em. No, we just got to make up our minds\r\nthat we\'re the last ones alive."\r\n\r\n_The last ones alive._ The thought was like flame in his mind. The\r\nnumbness was gone now, as coldness thaws from a warmed body, but there\r\ncame to him a second thought, a horrible, fear-born thought which he\r\ndared not say aloud, even to Sandy.\r\n\r\n_A man can\'t live alone, without hearing another human voice, without\r\nseeing another human form. A man isn\'t made that way. You\'ve got two\r\nchoices now, just two: Suicide or madness. Which will it be? Suicide or\r\nmadness, suicide or madness...._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe sat for a long, long time, his mind a jumble of indecision. Then at\r\nlast he thought, _I don\'t want to go mad, the other way is best. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
We\'ll\r\nmake it easy. Carbon monoxide would be the easiest way._\r\n\r\nBut suddenly there was a churning and a twisting in his stomach, as\r\nthough it were being squeezed by a giant hand.\r\n\r\n"Golly, Sandy, we forgot to eat. And we haven\'t eaten for two days."\r\nAnd to himself he said, _This\'ll be our last meal, the last we\'ll ever\r\nhave._\r\n\r\nHe took the pup in his arms and Sandy followed. He spied a huge sign\r\nnot far away--_Cafe Royale_. It was a magnificent restaurant, the\r\ncarpeted, canopied entrance reminding him of the front of a sultan\'s\r\npalace. Three days ago--if he\'d been foolish enough to come to the City\r\nthen--he\'d have rushed past it with his hand protecting his pocketbook,\r\nhardly daring to look within lest the stiff-shirted, high-chinned\r\nwaiters and patrons think him a country bumpkin.\r\n\r\nBut now--well, why not?\r\n\r\nHe ambled through the vast dining hall with its multitude of\r\nwhite-clothed tables, its potted palms, its modernistic, chromium bar.\r\nThe high walls were decorated with soft-hued, multi-colored murals\r\ndepicting the rise of Western Civilization--first, the pioneers, the\r\ncowboys, then a factory scene and a war scene, and finally a group of\r\nspacemen entering a moon-bound rocket.\r\n\r\nMartin made a wheezing sound of admiration. "What a place, eh, Sandy?\r\nWe should have come here a long time ago."\r\n\r\nThen he spied the juke box. "There\'s one of them music machines--and\r\nit\'s lit up. Reckon the power\'s still on."\r\n\r\nMartin had always wanted to play a juke box, but nickels, back home,\r\nwere scarce. He pursed his lips. "Why not, Sandy? Nickels don\'t mean\r\nmuch now, and if this is going to be our last meal, we might as well\r\nenjoy it."\r\n\r\nHe inserted a quarter, and after a few moments of pushing this and\r\nthat button, music played. It was "Song of The Stars," the latest\r\nhit, vibrant, full, rhythmic--not at all like the screeching from the\r\nsecond-hand video he\'d owned once.\r\n\r\nWhile he listened, he strode to the bar. Not that he was a drinking\r\nman. He occasionally had a cold beer on Saturday evening; that was\r\nall. But now, with that dazzling array of bottles glittering before\r\nhim--"Nobody\'ll miss it now," he told Sandy.\r\n\r\nHe poured himself three fingers of Scotch and downed it thirstily.\r\n"Ahhhh! Been a long time since I had anything like that. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
Now let\'s see\r\nwhat\'s in that kitchen.

=== Chunk 9 ===
"\r\n\r\nElectricity was still on. Refrigerators were humming, and Martin\'s gaze\r\nwandered appraisingly over red, juicy T-bones, over dressed chickens,\r\nturkeys, rabbits, hams.\r\n\r\n"Reckon we\'re too hungry to wait for chicken," he drawled. "Guess\r\nT-bones\'d be nice for a last meal. How about it, Sandy?"\r\n\r\nSandy barked.\r\n\r\nDinner was soon ready. Fried T-bone, mashed potatoes and dark\r\ngravy, caviar, some kind of soup with a fishy taste, apple pie with\r\nstrawberry ice cream, chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream, maple nut,\r\ntuiti-fruiti and pineapple ice cream, and coffee.\r\n\r\nMartin settled back and puffed on a 50c cigar. "You know, Sandy, it\r\nwouldn\'t always be like this. In a couple of weeks there won\'t be any\r\nmore power. Food will spoil, there\'ll be only canned stuff."\r\n\r\nHe frowned thoughtfully. Perhaps he\'d been wrong. Perhaps suicide was\r\nnot the best way. He could have a few pleasures in the next day or\r\ntwo--if madness didn\'t come. And if madness did start to come, well....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was a sleek, streamlined jet job, the automobile of automobiles. Not\r\nan antiquated monstrosity like the \'51 coupe he\'d been driving.\r\n\r\nHe stared through the window at its tear-drop lines, at its broad,\r\ntransparent top, at the shiny chrome and gold.\r\n\r\n"We shouldn\'t be thinking about such things, Sandy. We should be\r\nthinking about all those people, those poor people who died. All the\r\nmen and women and children--"\r\n\r\nFor an instant, grief welled up within him, a cold, almost sickening\r\ngrief. But abruptly, it became an impersonal, remote kind of grief.\r\nIt was like a Fourth of July rocket shooting out a blinding tail of\r\ncrimson and then bursting, its body crumbling into a thousand pieces, a\r\nthousand tiny sparks falling and fading and dying.\r\n\r\n"Still, they knew it was coming, didn\'t they, Sandy? And they didn\'t\r\ntry very hard to stop it."\r\n\r\nHe looked again at the car. "Reckon it won\'t do any harm to see how it\r\nruns. After all, if we\'re goin\' mad, we might as well enjoy ourselves\r\nfirst."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe window display in the sport shop fascinated him. There were guns\r\nand fishing rods and fur-lined jackets and shiny boots and bright\r\nwoolen shirts and sun goggles and camp stoves and--\r\n\r\n"Don\'t reckon the guns\'d do us much good," Martin murmured, "seein\' as\r\nhow there\'s nothing left alive--\'cept us. Might be fun to shoot \'em\r\nthough. I remember when I was a kid, how I used to shoot windows out of\r\nold houses." He chuckled softly.\r\n\r\nHis gaze traveled to the fishing equipment. "Golly, Sandy, I\'ll bet\r\nthere\'s fish left in the oceans! The gas never touched us there in the\r\ncave. I\'ll bet the fish--or a lot of \'em--escaped, too!"\r\n\r\nHe glanced disapprovingly at his thin, faded shirt, dirty khaki\r\ntrousers, and worn, scuffed shoes. Those clean, bright, woolen clothes\r\nin the window would be nice, very nice, on cool nights.\r\n\r\n"Might even have dog clothes in there," he said. "Maybe a dog sweater.\r\nHow\'d you like that, Sandy?"\r\n\r\nSandy barked eagerly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe squatted on the floor of the travel office, surrounded by a sea\r\nof crisp, gaudy-colored posters and pamphlets. What a place this old\r\nEarth was! The pyramids of Egypt, the Tower of London, the Washington\r\nMonument, the Florida Everglades, the Arch of Triumph, the Eiffel\r\nTower, Yosemite Valley, Boulder Dam, the Wall of China, Yellowstone\r\nPark, Suez Canal, Panama Canal, Niagara. Why, it would take a lifetime\r\nto see them all!\r\n\r\n"You know, Sandy, if a man _didn\'t_ go mad from being alone, he could\r\nsee a lot of things. He could travel anywhere on this continent in a\r\ncar. If something went wrong, he could get parts out of other cars,\r\nget gas out of other tanks. There\'s plenty of canned food everywhere,\r\n\'nough to last a lifetime--a dozen lifetimes. Why, he could walk right\r\ninto Washington, right into the White House and see how the President\r\nlived, or go to Hollywood and see how they used to make pictures, or\r\ngo to them telescope places and look at the stars. Course, there\'d be\r\nbodies almost everywhere, but in a year or so they\'d be gone, all \'cept\r\nthe bones which never hurt nobody."\r\n\r\nHe scratched his neck thoughtfully. "Why, you wouldn\'t have to stay on\r\nthis continent even. You could find a little boat and sail up the coast\r\nto Alaska and then cut across to Asia. It\'s only fifty miles, they say.\r\nAnd then you could go down to China and India and Africa and Europe.\r\nWhy, a man could go any place in the world alone!"\r\n\r\nSandy began to lick his face and the pup released a nervous, eager bark\r\nthat was more like "Yip! 

=== Chunk 10 ===
Yip!" than a bark.\r\n\r\n"That\'s right, Sandy. I\'m not alone, am I? No more than I ever was,\r\nreally. Never liked to talk to people anyway. You\'re only two years\r\nold, you\'ll live for ten, maybe twelve years yet, you and the pup.\r\nMaybe longer than I will."\r\n\r\nHe rose, frowning. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
It was strange. There was a grief and a loneliness\r\nwithin him and he knew they would be within him forever. But, too,\r\nthere was an ever-growing peace and contentment and a satisfaction, and\r\na sense of still belonging to Earth and being a part of it. Strangest\r\nof all, he realized that there was no madness in his mind and no seed\r\nof madness. He felt like a boy again, about to begin a wondrous journey\r\nthrough unexplored and enchanted lands to discover new marvels.\r\n\r\nHe left the travel office, Sandy and the pup barking and clammering at\r\nhis heels, and he was singing:\r\n\r\n    "We\'re happy, so happy,\r\n    Don\'t want to reach a star;\r\n    We\'re happy, always happy,\r\n    Just the way we are...."\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
