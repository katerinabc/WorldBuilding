]\r\n\r\n\r\nHer fingers lightly caressed a button on the long table as she\r\nhalf-turned toward him. At this moment, she was glad they still wore\r\nthe semi-barbaric accoutrements donned for last night\'s festivities,\r\ncommemorating the conclusion of the final war--weird, fantastic\r\ntrappings, selected more for adornment than for approximations of\r\nancient military dress--for he would not notice that she was trembling.\r\nWhen at last she spoke, her voice was steady.\r\n\r\n"Please go now, quickly."\r\n\r\nHis hand made as if to clasp her arm, then dropped to his side. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
For an\r\ninstant he stood there, words welling to his lips, then, with a half\r\nshrug he turned away. She did not move as he strode toward the doorway,\r\nglanced out the window; her back was a picture of composure.\r\n\r\n"Natalla!" It was not a command, or yet a call, but a cry of\r\nastonishment blended with horror. Gone was her carefully built-up\r\npoise as she whirled, then gasped as she saw the look in his eyes.\r\nSwiftly she hurried toward the window, but he stood in front of her,\r\nblocking her view.\r\n\r\n"What is it, Eric?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t look," he gasped. For a moment she felt fear coursing through\r\nher, fear that at this moment he would wilt, give way to terror.\r\nShe bit her lips, telling herself she couldn\'t endure the sight of\r\nit. But, an instant later, the panic had left him; she could see\r\nrugged determination flowing back into his being. Almost faint with\r\nthankfulness for the strength of him, she relaxed against his body,\r\npermitted him to lead her across the room to a sofa.\r\n\r\n"Do you remember Greer?" His voice was analytically thoughtful. "He was\r\nthe little astronomer who made those startlingly radical predictions\r\nabout a year ago. Remember how we all checked his data? No one could\r\nfind anything of the sort, even though we checked and re-checked a\r\ndozen times. The conclusion was the only one that could be drawn under\r\nsuch circumstances; Greer was suffering from delusions. So he was cured\r\nby the psychiatry department."\r\n\r\nHer nose wrinkled in concentration. "Greer? Wasn\'t he the one who\r\nclaimed to have discovered a sort of gaseous cloud in space? Our system\r\nwas supposed to be approaching it; when it reached our atmosphere, it\r\nwould prove a deadly poison to all life-forms on this planet."\r\n\r\n"Yes--that\'s it. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Well, it seems he was right. It\'s come--the green\r\ncloud. All I could see out that window was the nauseous swirls of it,\r\nand the people where they\'d fallen in the streets. Neither of us can\r\nleave this building." He snapped on the tele-screen. It lit up; he\r\ncould hear the faint hum of the machinery, but no images appeared.\r\n"Dead!"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _All I could see out the window was green whirls of\r\nit--and people where they had fallen!_]\r\n\r\n"Eric, it couldn\'t be."\r\n\r\nHe paced up and down the floor, clasping and unclasping his hands. "I\r\ndon\'t know. It came without warning on a night when nearly everyone\r\nwas out celebrating. No one in the streets or parks could have been\r\nprepared for it. Most of the dwellings were probably left with windows\r\nopened. It\'s only sheer luck that it wasn\'t the case here. And luck\r\nagain that we came back early."\r\n\r\n"Please sit down," she begged. He looked at her a moment, then\r\nshrugged, came over to the sofa, and sat beside her. "There must have\r\nbeen some, Eric," she said.\r\n\r\n"The law of averages would seem to indicate that. There might be some\r\nwho are naturally immune to whatever brand of poison this is; some who\r\nescaped as did we; some who were underground, or in forests. But until\r\nwe learn differently, we must assume that we are the only humans alive."\r\n\r\nHis eyes were haunted. "How could we have missed it?" he whispered. "We\r\nchecked and re-checked all the data, and put it to the calculating\r\nmachines. The answer was the same each time: no such cloud existed."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps there were some factors that only Greer himself knew. Some\r\nsmall items concerning his calculations which he overlooked in\r\npresenting data, not realizing that it had influenced him. If one\r\nfactor were missing, known only to Greer, then all the machines in the\r\nworld might well give a negative result."\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. "It\'s fantastic--yet, what can we think? If your\r\nidea of a missing factor is correct, we\'ll never know. Even if Greer is\r\nstill alive. He was cured of his delusion."\r\n\r\nShe was silent for a moment, then she slipped off her gloves, laid a\r\nhand on his arm. "Eric," she whispered. "I\'m sorry it had to happen at\r\na time like this. It may be that Sandra escaped, too. I know what she\r\nmeans to you. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
If we find her, later, I shan\'t stand in the way."\r\n\r\nHe chewed his lips. "That\'s all over, now. The first thing we must do\r\nis to check up on the food, water, and sanitation system. Just how long\r\nthe machines will run without human supervision is questionable--not\r\nlong, at any rate. The robots cannot do everything alone, either."\r\n\r\nHer eyes were calm and clear, her voice a breath of cool air in the\r\nheat of his anguish. "Then let\'s do it the same way, Eric. Nothing\r\nis going to happen for awhile. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Let\'s tackle the problem after we\'re\r\nrefreshed." She moved to free herself from him; he had, automatically,\r\nslipped his arm around her waist, drawn her to him. "You--you can use\r\nthe lab for your quarters. Good night, Eric."\r\n\r\nHe held her back. "Natalla."\r\n\r\n"Let me go," she murmured.\r\n\r\n"Natalla, wait. I didn\'t tell you all I saw. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
It was more than--the\r\ncloud." He fell silent, breathing rapidly.\r\n\r\n"Well?" she said.\r\n\r\n"I was reading some of the old books yesterday. Some of them centuries\r\nold. The people then, most of them, didn\'t live as well as we do but\r\nthey were very much like us in some other ways.\r\n\r\n"They--well, sometimes a man would think he had fallen out of harmony\r\nwith his mate. In this book, the man thought he\'d found another woman\r\nmore suitable to his psyche. He was about to obtain a release--divorce\r\nI think they used to call it--when she was injured in an accident. His\r\nmate, I mean. The medical experts did not think she could live.\r\n\r\n"He realized then, when it seemed to be too late, that there could\r\nnever be any other mate for him. They didn\'t have psychoadjusters in\r\nthose days, so, if she died, he would be affected for many years. The\r\nonly way emotional upsets could wear off was through the primitive\r\nprocess of letting time wear them down, little by little. It all ended\r\nwell, however, because medical experts discovered that it was only her\r\npsyche that made the injury seem fatal; when she found that he still\r\nwanted her to be his mate, she recovered."\r\n\r\n"Eric, what are you trying to tell me?"\r\n\r\n"That I don\'t want to be released from you ever. Even if this had never\r\nhappened, if what I saw out there was only my imagination.\r\n\r\n"I know now that I was only deceiving myself when I sought release\r\nfrom you. Sandra? Well, I rather like her, but she could never take\r\nyour place. I still wish to be your mate, Natalla."\r\n\r\nHer eyes answered him, he thought.\r\n\r\n"You\'re tired, Eric. But perhaps you\'d better not spend the night in\r\nthe lab after all."\r\n\r\nHe reached down, picked her up in his arms. "In the old days," he said,\r\n"it was considered particularly fine form for a man to carry his mate\r\nto their sleeping quarters."\r\n\r\nShe smiled and buried her face against his shoulder. No need to tell\r\nhim that she, too, had read the old books. Or that she\'d rigged up a\r\nz-special screen outside that window, projected a carefully-made film\r\non it. After all, _she_ hadn\'t seen the green cloud. He\'d held her\r\nback. And hadn\'t he mentioned something about it being his imagination.\r\n\r\nShe wouldn\'t be too harsh on him, of course, tomorrow morning when all\r\nwas discovered to be well. And she was positive that he hadn\'t noticed\r\nher fingers slide over the button as she leaned against the table a\r\nmoment ago, the button summoning a robot, pre-instructed to dismantle\r\nthe apparatus.\r\n\r\n24th Century or no 24th Century, men were still such dear fools.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
