If a man wasn\'t careful a thing\r\n             like that could linger on--after the wedding!\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Imagination Stories of Science and Fantasy\r\n                               May 1955\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThad Morgan looked around his little room. The two deactivated robots\r\nand the framework that suspended the limp suit hardly left room for him\r\nto move around. At the moment he felt mildly disgusted with this whole\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\nHe asked himself why engagements and marriages had to be surrounded\r\nwith tradition and ridiculous games. But, of course, he had to go\r\nthrough with it. Myrna seemed to have been filled with excitement when\r\nthey were discussing the final plans for the ceremony. He might as well\r\nget started. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
He glanced at the clock; it was almost eight. He picked up\r\nthe book of rules and looked at it again.\r\n\r\nHe re-read the instructions for operating the mechanism. First,\r\nit said, inspect the facsimile and see that it is well-groomed and\r\nentirely in order. He looked at the two lifeless twins of himself.\r\nYes, they looked all right. He decided which one he would use tonight.\r\nThen, he read, he was to get into the suit (the book called it a\r\nharness), activate the selected facsimile, and set the controls. It\r\nwent on to say that every movement he made would be duplicated by the\r\nrobot. Everything the facsimile experienced would be transmitted to the\r\nharness becoming his experiences. Well, he had practiced all that since\r\nrenting the thing three days ago. He turned towards the marriage game\r\nrules.\r\n\r\nThe rules dictated seven situations. That would mean, in his case,\r\nseven evenings for Myrna and him to decide whether they were meeting\r\neach other\'s robots or their real selves.\r\n\r\nThe book pointed out that the primary or real body had to be used\r\nat least once in the first five situations. The first contestant to\r\ncorrectly identify the other\'s real body won the game and the contest\r\nwas over. The winner received commendation and was supposed to be the\r\ndominant spouse. Of course, the last was mere convention. However,\r\nthe most important, the most rigid, and to Thad the most fantastic,\r\nrule in the whole contest was that if the girl won, the couple was\r\nrequired to wait a year before completing the marriage ceremony. That\r\nseemed a weightier matter to Morgan. He read on. The first contestant\r\nwho correctly identified the other as a facsimile won a point. If\r\nhe failed, the other contestant had the opportunity to make an\r\nidentification. The situation ended when one contestant made a correct\r\nidentification or when both failed. Laying the book down, he decided\r\nhe\'d better get started because it was getting late.\r\n\r\nHe climbed into the harness and hung in mid-air suspended by his belt.\r\nHe activated one of his facsimiles and turned his head so he could see\r\nhimself through the robot\'s eyes. Thumbing his nose, he watched the\r\ncreature hanging in the harness do likewise. It gave him an eerie\r\nfeeling. Even though he knew he was walking in thin air and getting\r\nnowhere, it really seemed as if he could feel the floor under his feet\r\nand see the room move around him in a very ordinary fashion. As soon as\r\nhis facsimile left the room, his mind made the adjustment and it was as\r\nif it were really he strolling nonchalantly down the corridor.\r\n\r\nHe drove to a florist\'s shop and started to purchase a corsage.\r\nAbashed, he caught himself. He rushed out of the shop and went home to\r\nput a wallet and handkerchief into his pockets. He would have to be\r\nmore careful, he realized. Slips like that might cost him the contest.\r\n\r\nWith corsage box in hand, he pressed the door bell and waited. He hoped\r\nhis plastic flesh was moulded perfectly. It looked all right to him,\r\nbut you never could tell what someone else might notice. Myrna opened\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShe was lovely and he took her in his arms. Drawing back, he looked at\r\nher dubiously. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
At least, he thought it was she. His family, her family,\r\nand two or three others, acting as judges and referees in the contest,\r\nstood in the living room watching them. They began to laugh as they saw\r\nhis questioning look. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
It really was rather funny, he decided. Myrna\r\nled him into the room and introduced him to the few he didn\'t know.\r\n\r\nHe watched her closely as she opened the box. He thought her fingers\r\nwere fumbling a bit. Everyone in the room watched the two of them\r\nintently. They didn\'t know whether the couple were real or robot\r\neither. At any moment, she might suddenly try to identify him. Maybe he\r\nshould take the first chance. She might be fumbling from nervousness,\r\nhe realized. If it were really she and he called her a robot, she might\r\nbe offended. Girls were like that, but of course, he would have to take\r\nthat chance.\r\n\r\n"You\'re a robot," he announced suddenly.\r\n\r\nMyrna looked surprised. "Oh, how did you know?" She was crestfallen.\r\nHe was congratulated as they all trooped upstairs to help Myrna out of\r\nher harness. Later it was nice to know for sure that it was really her\r\nliving flesh in his arms. Then he felt guilty as he realized she was\r\nnot in his living arms. He excused himself hurriedly and returned home.\r\n\r\nThe next evening he was invited to Myrna\'s home for dinner. He thought\r\nof actually going himself because he knew the food would be good. The\r\napparatus could transmit heat, cold, and pressure, but it didn\'t do\r\nmuch when it came to taste and it couldn\'t make any sensation in one\'s\r\ninterior.\r\n\r\nBut he decided it would be too risky. If she identified his facsimile\r\nshe would win a point to be sure, but if she identified his real self,\r\nwell, that would end the contest and he would have to wait a year to\r\nget married.\r\n\r\nHe would have to be careful of the food though. She might try to trick\r\nhim with something that looked good but tasted terrible, and his\r\nfacsimile would eat it just the same.\r\n\r\nThat night before sending his proxy to Myrna\'s dinner party, he had his\r\nfacsimile stick himself with a pin. The sharp pain made him wince. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
He\r\nwondered about the mechanics of the machine. He supposed that his pain\r\nwas caused by a tiny electrical shock that stimulated a pain nerve. He\r\nrealized that the more he could find out about his equipment the better\r\nhis chances were of winning.\r\n\r\nThat evening Myrna was very watchful and very cool. He wondered if she\r\nsuspected that she had been loved by a robot the evening before. He had\r\nhardly seated himself at the table when she called him a robot. The\r\nfamilies seemed uproariously amused. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
He wondered how she had known. He\r\ncongratulated her politely and she was allowed to go unidentified since\r\nit was her round.\r\n\r\nWhen his facsimile was brought back to the room, Thad climbed wearily\r\nout of his harness and made himself a cold, uninteresting supper. He\r\nfelt lonely. Was Myrna really sore at him? Damn this whole business! He\r\nwished he didn\'t have to go through all of this.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next evening he had a plan worked out. He went himself and greeted\r\nher at the door, slammed it shut, and bent towards her to listen. It\r\nwould take a moment for the reverberation to reach her room. If she\r\nwere a robot, the sound would come through the primary microphone\r\nin the sender and he might be able to hear the faint echo from her\r\nlips. He did, and he immediately announced her as a facsimile. Her\r\ncongratulations were hardly more than civil.\r\n\r\nHe left with no great feeling of triumph.\r\n\r\nThe next three evenings, she was very distant. He understood why she\r\ndidn\'t meet him at the door anymore, but he couldn\'t tell why the rest\r\nof her behavior was so cold. She was very lucky, too. She identified\r\nhim correctly as a robot each time before he even had time to greet\r\nthe rest of the family. The day went very slowly. Thad left the office\r\nearly in his uneasiness. Tonight was the seventh and last situation.\r\nHe hoped it also wouldn\'t be their last evening together. At this\r\npoint, he hardly knew what to do. If she won the contest, it would be a\r\nwhole long year before they could marry. He knew that quite often that\r\nspelled the finish to a romance. On the other hand, if he won, it might\r\nestrange them immediately. She had such pride. What to do?\r\n\r\nHe decided to forget the robots and go as his real self again. Points\r\nwere in her favor anyway. He realized that if she were present by\r\nfacsimile, he couldn\'t possibly win. He might as well be the first\r\none to guess and be done with it. It wasn\'t the contest that mattered\r\nanyhow; it was Myrna and what she was feeling.\r\n\r\nWhen he rang the doorbell that evening, the corsage box under his arm\r\ncontained orchids. Unexpectedly, it was Myrna that opened the door.\r\n\r\n"Hello, _real_ Myrna."\r\n\r\nShe hesitated for a moment. "Good evening, Thad. Please come in."\r\n\r\nHe followed her in and greeted the family. She opened the box and for\r\na moment she seemed impressed. Then she regained her composure. He\r\naccepted her formal thanks as the families milled around admiring the\r\ngift. Everyone seemed slightly restrained. Thad finally phrased the\r\nquestion that they were all thinking.\r\n\r\n"Are you real?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you could tell if you kissed me," she said with mocking\r\nsweetness.\r\n\r\n"Myrna, I\'m sorry about that first evening, but I forgot that I wasn\'t\r\nreally there." He wished the family wasn\'t there so close. All of them\r\nwatching and listening made him feel an even greater uneasiness. Oh, he\r\nthought, the hell with this contest!\r\n\r\n"Myrna, honey, look, I don\'t care if it\'s really you or not. Well, that\r\nis, I mean--"\r\n\r\nHis voice faded out. He realized he was getting more confused. Someone\r\nsnickered. Myrna was watching him with a contemptuous smile curving her\r\nlips. The whole thing suddenly made him mad.\r\n\r\n"O.K.! I don\'t care who wins the contest! I don\'t care if we do have to\r\nwait a year. I don\'t even care at the moment if there\'s going to be a\r\nwedding or not."\r\n\r\nHe started out of the room dimly aware that he was angrier than he\r\nrealized. Myrna caught him in the vestibule.\r\n\r\n"Thad! Thad! 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Wait! Please, I know I was being spiteful. You won the\r\ncontest, I\'m really me. Please don\'t go like this. I\'d never forgive\r\nmyself."\r\n\r\nShe looked up at him tearfully. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
He felt himself relenting finally and\r\nsmiled. She threw her arms around his neck and he drew her close.\r\n\r\nAfter a very long kiss, she looked up at him and said softly, "Thad,\r\nlet\'s be sure the robots are all sent back to the agency before our\r\nhoneymoon."\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
