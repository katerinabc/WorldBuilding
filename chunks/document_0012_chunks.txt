I remember\r\nthe hot, cling-film-in-a-microwave smell of it, and Da\'s look of\r\nferocious concentration as he filled it with fresh goop, and the warm,\r\nfresh-baked feel of the objects that came out of it.\r\n\r\nThe coppers came through the door with truncheons swinging, one of them\r\nreciting the terms of the warrant through a bullhorn.  One of Da\'s\r\ncustomers had shopped him.  The ipolice paid in high-grade\r\npharmaceuticals -- performance enhancers, memory supplements, metabolic\r\nboosters.  The kind of things that cost a fortune over the counter; the\r\nkind of things you could print at home, if you didn\'t mind the risk of\r\nhaving your kitchen filled with a sudden crush of big, beefy bodies,\r\nhard truncheons whistling through the air, smashing anyone and anything\r\nthat got in the way.\r\n\r\nThey destroyed grandma\'s trunk, the one she\'d brought from the old\r\ncountry.  They smashed our little refrigerator and the purifier unit\r\nover the window.  My tweetybird escaped death by hiding in a corner of\r\nhis cage as a big, booted foot crushed most of it into a sad tangle of\r\nprinter-wire.\r\n\r\nDa.  What they did to him.  

=== Chunk 3 ===
When he was done, he looked like he\'d been\r\nbrawling with an entire rugby side.  They brought him out the door and\r\nlet the newsies get a good look at him as they tossed him in the car.\r\nAll the while a spokesman told the world that my Da\'s organized-crime\r\nbootlegging operation had been responsible for at least 20 million in\r\ncontraband, and that my Da, the desperate villain, had resisted arrest.\r\n\r\nI saw it all from my phone, in the remains of the sitting room, watching\r\nit on the screen and wondering how, just how anyone could look at our\r\nlittle flat and our terrible, manky estate and mistake it for the home\r\nof an organized crime kingpin.  They took the printer away, of course,\r\nand displayed it like a trophy for the newsies.  Its little shrine in\r\nthe kitchenette seemed horribly empty.  When I roused myself and picked\r\nup the flat and rescued my poor peeping tweetybird, I put a blender\r\nthere.  It was made out of printed parts, so it would only last a month\r\nbefore I\'d need to print new bearings and other moving parts.  Back\r\nthen, I could take apart and reassemble anything that could be printed.\r\n\r\nBy the time I turned 18, they were ready to let Da out of prison.  I\'d\r\nvisited him three times -- on my tenth birthday, on his fiftieth, and\r\nwhen Ma died.  It had been two years since I\'d last seen him and he was\r\nin bad shape.  A prison fight had left him with a limp, and he looked\r\nover his shoulder so often it was like he had a tic.  I was embarrassed\r\nwhen the minicab dropped us off in front of the estate, and tried to\r\nkeep my distance from this ruined, limping skeleton as we went inside\r\nand up the stairs.\r\n\r\n"Lanie," he said, as he sat me down.  "You\'re a smart girl, I know that.\r\nYou wouldn\'t know where your old Da could get a printer and some goop?"\r\n\r\nI squeezed my hands into fists so tight my fingernails cut into my\r\npalms.  I closed my eyes.  "You\'ve been in prison for ten years, Da.\r\nTen.  Years.  You\'re going to risk another ten years to print out more\r\nblenders and pharma, more laptops and designer hats?"\r\n\r\nHe grinned.  "I\'m not stupid, Lanie.  I\'ve learned my lesson.  There\'s\r\nno hat or laptop that\'s worth going to jail for.  I\'m not going to print\r\nnone of that rubbish, never again." He had a cup of tea, and he drank it\r\nnow like it was whisky, a sip and then a long, satisfied exhalation.  He\r\nclosed his eyes and leaned back in his chair.\r\n\r\n"Come here, Lanie, let me whisper in your ear.  Let me tell you the\r\nthing that I decided while I spent ten years in lockup.  Come here and\r\nlisten to your stupid Da."\r\n\r\nI felt a guilty pang about ticking him off.  He was off his rocker, that\r\nmuch was clear.  God knew what he went through in prison.  "What, Da?" I\r\nsaid, leaning in close.\r\n\r\n"Lanie, I\'m going to print more printers.  Lots more printers.  One for\r\neveryone.  That\'s worth going to jail for.
