But\r\n            this was a new twist, a fish that really wasn\'t\r\n           a fish at all. So the question, who hooked what?\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Imagination Stories of Science and Fantasy\r\n                             December 1954\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOff Key West in the Florida Strait, with the bucking of the motor\r\nlaunch under the seat of my pants, and a rod and reel in my hands, I\r\ncould relax. I mean really relax. Sometimes a cool current from the\r\nGulf of Mexico would engulf me and it would be like something a man\r\ndreams about. Alone, under a blue sky, with one\'s thoughts. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
And then\r\nthe thoughts would vanish as that familiar tug on the line meant a\r\nstruggle was coming up. A battle between man and fish.\r\n\r\nI love deep sea fishing. I was on a vacation with nothing to do but\r\nrelax. Oh, there were women, all right. But one gets tired of women.\r\nBut not fishing.\r\n\r\nSo here I was, this bright sunny afternoon, in my motor launch, when\r\nthat tug on my line made me sit erect, and my brain became alert. You\r\nhave to think clearly. You have to know when to let out line and when\r\nto pull in line. When the fish got tired you could tell. It all comes\r\nthrough experience.\r\n\r\nFrom the pull of the line I thought I\'d hooked a sailfish.\r\n\r\nI reeled in fast, then started letting out line. But the line didn\'t\r\nget taut. It was loose. At first I thought I\'d lost it.\r\n\r\nAnd then it climbed into the launch.\r\n\r\nI got up fast and made ready to dive overboard.\r\n\r\n"Hold on, fella," it said. "Don\'t get into a panic."\r\n\r\nI stared at it. It was about four feet tall, with scales and two thick\r\nstubs that was supposed to be tails. It stood on its tails and blinked\r\nenormous eyes at me.\r\n\r\n"The creature from the black lagoon," I said.\r\n\r\n"To you I\'m a creature," he said. "To me you\'re a creature."\r\n\r\n"What kind of a fish are you?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not a fish. I\'m a Grenarian."\r\n\r\n"You mean you eat vegetables?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m from the planet Grenaria."\r\n\r\n"Look," I said. "You want this boat? Keep it. I\'m off for Tampa. It\'s\r\nabout time I took up drinking."\r\n\r\n"You hate me."\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t. Honest. I\'m just not used to these things."\r\n\r\n"It happens all the time. What you don\'t understand you hate."\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t. Honest. And where did you learn to talk?"\r\n\r\n"I learned English from a professor. He understood my plight and tried\r\nto help. He was fishing the same as you when I caught hold of his line\r\nand we met."\r\n\r\n"What happened to him?"\r\n\r\n"He went back to tell his colleagues. I never saw him again."\r\n\r\n"He\'s probably in the booby hatch," I said.\r\n\r\n"What\'s that?"\r\n\r\n"Where I\'ll be if I ever tell anyone this."\r\n\r\n"This is a cruel world," he said. "By the way my name is Hrodes."\r\n\r\n"And mine is Carol Engelholtz. Now that the formalities are over, what\r\nthe hell are you doing here?"\r\n\r\n"My orders were to make contact with this solar system. My ship is at\r\nthe bottom of the sea. I have to be near water or die. And every time I\r\ntry to make contact I\'m left alone on a craft of this sort."\r\n\r\n"You mean they jump overboard?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s exactly what I mean."\r\n\r\n"You\'re from another galaxy?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. My planet is covered with water. Your planet is the best one in\r\nthis system which has water on it. That\'s why I\'m here."\r\n\r\n"But you\'re not in water now."\r\n\r\n"My gills can still absorb it. As long as I\'m near it.

=== Chunk 3 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Well, what do you want me to do?"\r\n\r\n"I want to meet someone with responsibility."\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t be able to get anyone to come out here with a story like\r\nthat. They wouldn\'t believe me. I\'d end up with the professor."\r\n\r\n"Then take me with you."\r\n\r\n"But you wouldn\'t be near water. Wait a minute. I can leave you in the\r\ntub."\r\n\r\n"Anything. I just want to get this mission over with."\r\n\r\n"I can wrap you up in wet towels. I can drive you to my place and go\r\nbring someone back with me."\r\n\r\n"Anything. Anything. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Just let\'s get on with it."\r\n\r\n"Why, I might be making history. I may become famous."\r\n\r\n"Will you please start this craft back to land?"\r\n\r\n"Sure thing. Just a second," I started the motor and headed for land.\r\n\r\nMe. Carol Engelholtz. A liaison between two planets. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
I never felt so\r\nexcited in my life. Why, it was more exciting than hooking a sailfish.\r\n\r\n"There\'s my lodge," I shouted, pointing at the bluff just over a rise.\r\n\r\n"You stay there alone?" Hrodes asked.\r\n\r\n"I have a cook and a housekeeper. But they won\'t bother you. You\'ll\r\nstay in the tub in my bathroom while I go fetch somebody. But who do I\r\ngo fetch?"\r\n\r\n"Anyone with responsibility. I want to get this over with."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, I know. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Your mission." I docked the launch, soaked towels,\r\nwrapped them around Hrodes, carried him--or she--to my car, and in\r\nfifteen minutes I was home.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI left Hrodes in the tub and went back to the car. Miami was too far\r\noff. There was a small town called Chesterville a few miles away. It\r\nseemed the only place to go.\r\n\r\n"There ain\'t no F.B.I. branch here," a deputy behind a battered desk\r\nsaid. He was about sixty, with a skinny neck that was covered with\r\nhalf dollar size blotches. "Better try Miami. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Why? What\'s the matter?\r\nFind some subversives? A lot of subversives in Florida."\r\n\r\n"No, no, nothing like that. Look, there must be a school or some kind\r\nof place for learning here."\r\n\r\n"Shore thing. We gotta school."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t there a professor teaching there, maybe?"\r\n\r\n"Nope. But we got old Mrs. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
Henshaw. Husband died about six years ago.\r\nOld bag. I think she\'s been running around lately with some tourist\r\nfrom Iowa. Now if you\'re just lookin\' for any old professor, then--"\r\n\r\n"That\'s right," I said, grasping at a straw. "Any old professor. Is\r\nthere one in town?"\r\n\r\n"Professor Klugelmeyer. Used to teach at some eastern college. Kind of\r\ndopey, though, I think. Funny old gaffer. Believes in flyin\' saucers.\r\nCan you imagine?"\r\n\r\n"Where do I reach him?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s stayin\' at Mrs. Kirpatrick\'s roomin\' house. Poor Mrs. Kirpatrick.\r\nGot a bad case of food poisoning. She ate--"\r\n\r\nI ran out of the building and inquired for the rooming house. I found\r\nit and Professor Klugelmeyer.\r\n\r\n"What? What? Hard to believe--Hard to believe. Once heard the same\r\nstory from Professor Dickson. The poor fellow was put away. You must be\r\nmistaken, old man. You must be. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
Take my advice. Give up drinking. Bad\r\nfor the liver, too, you know."\r\n\r\n"That old deputy told me you believe in flying saucers," I said.\r\n\r\n"I do. I really do. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
From Mars, probably. But they certainly won\'t turn\r\nout to be fish. Fish talking? Come now."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t believe it at first myself. Listen, Professor, come with me.\r\nSee and hear for yourself."\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know."\r\n\r\nIt took me an hour before I had him half convinced. I almost dragged\r\nhim to my car.\r\n\r\n"This had better not turn out to be a practical joke," he said. The\r\nprofessor was somewhere between sixty and seventy. He was kind of thin\r\nand he sported a long white mustache.\r\n\r\nIt was getting toward evening when we got to the lodge.\r\n\r\nI ushered him in to my room. "There," I said, flinging open the\r\nbathroom door.\r\n\r\n"Where?" he said.\r\n\r\n"There."\r\n\r\n"Where?"\r\n\r\nI looked. I blinked. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
I looked again. The tub was empty.\r\n\r\nI raced through the house.\r\n\r\nIn the front room I saw Mrs. O\'Brien, my housekeeper.\r\n\r\n"Where\'s Hrodes?" I asked her.\r\n\r\n"Who?"\r\n\r\n"He was in the tub. I left him there."\r\n\r\n"You mean that big fish?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes. Where is he?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s in the kitchen. We\'re having him for dinner."\r\n\r\n"What!"\r\n\r\n"Sure. Yat has it in the oven now."\r\n\r\n"You murderer!"\r\n\r\n"What are you talking about? It\'s only a fish. Didn\'t you catch him so\r\nwe\'d have fish for dinner?"\r\n\r\n"No. Didn\'t he tell you who he was?"\r\n\r\n"Are you crazy? He didn\'t tell me nothin\'. Besides, I didn\'t see it\r\ntill Sun Yat had it all cut up and laid out for cookin\'."\r\n\r\nSun Yat, my Chinese cook. Hrodes had met someone who couldn\'t\r\nunderstand his plight or be scared out of his wits. Sun Yat was a deaf\r\nmute!\r\n\r\nThe professor was clucking sadly at me as he stomped out of the house.\r\n\r\nMe? There was nothing to do but eat my dinner....\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
