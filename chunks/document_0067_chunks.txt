"I mean, with\r\nall due respect, of course."\r\n\r\nNo man enjoys coming into his dining room and having to sit at meals and\r\nlook at a full-sized picture of his wife\'s first husband arriving on\r\nVenus. Fair\'s fair, but such a set-up is ridiculous.\r\n\r\n"No," Phoebe shook her blonde head. "Don Manton loved me and he was\r\nfamous. I like to be reminded of the days when my picture was in all the\r\ntelepapers and my face on so many telescreens."\r\n\r\nShe might just as well have called him a tattered nonentity, though\r\nHenry was doing pretty well as a foreman in the local humandroid\r\nfactory. He was stopped from reminding her by Phoebe\'s saying that she\'d\r\nleave for a bit of shopping. She left abruptly.\r\n\r\nHenry watched her takeoff from the roof of their two-story fibroid house\r\nand went back to the dining room. Now, even his warmest admirers would\r\ngive in that he had a streak of stubbornness in him a mile wide and six\r\nmiles deep. Henry took the three-dimensional monstrosity off the wall,\r\nholding it hard by thumb and forefinger on its luminex frame, and\r\nprepared to say good-by to the picture of Don Manton.\r\n\r\nA foreman at one of the humandroid shops has to be able to consider\r\nalternatives and Henry had done this. If he only hid the picture there\'d\r\nbe a domestic crisis and the picture would sooner or later be back on\r\nthe wall; if he destroyed it there\'d also be a crisis, but one that\r\nwould eventually blow over.\r\n\r\nUnluckily for him, these three-dimensional wall pictures were made out\r\nof glaseine, and when he tried setting fire to it he nearly burned down\r\nthe house. Upon feeding it to the old-fashioned fireplace nothing grew\r\nhot except his temper. Ripping the picture to shreds would have been the\r\nnext step, but you can\'t rip glaseine.\r\n\r\nFor maybe the six millionth time he cursed out Don Manton, the\r\nwell-known explorer in the realm of outer space. Henry understood in a\r\ngeneral way that Don Manton had been among the first to chart the cities\r\nof Mars and Venus, and had accidentally died on a planet named Immel;\r\nbut Henry had no intention of living in Don Manton\'s shadow.\r\n\r\nThe picture, which showed the late explorer talking with three\r\nVenusians, had been hung up again when Phoebe came through the ceiling\r\ndoor along the extension stairway which flicked up to meet her.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve been trying to get rid of Don\'s picture!"\r\n\r\nHe\'d hung it crookedly, and a diagonal slash of white wallpaper had\r\ngiven him away.\r\n\r\n"Just this one.

You\'ve got cans of telefilm in the cellar, but them I\r\ndon\'t mind. This," he flicked it with a thumbnail, "I do mind."\r\n\r\n"As long as I stay," Phoebe said quietly, "my darling Don\'s picture\r\nstays."\r\n\r\n"But what about your darling Henry? Am I just a humandroid who looks and\r\nbehaves and talks like a human being? Haven\'t I got feelings?" Henry\r\nstrode around the room, hitting the fibroid floor like a prehistoric\r\nmonster on a sandpaper bridge. "Either that picture goes," he said\r\nfinally, definitely, "or I go!"\r\n\r\nPhoebe shook out her blonde hair, letting it fall about her shoulders.\r\n"Too bad."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nInside of an hour he had packed his suitcases. Phoebe cried bitterly,\r\nbut wouldn\'t budge about the picture. Henry took the plane. He put up at\r\nhis club, went to the bar, and was gobbling down something called\r\npressurized scotch, when he heard a noise back of him.\r\n\r\n"Get away from me!" said Henry, who was quite a few over the traditional\r\neight by this time. "I\'ve had enough of Don Manton, let alone his\r\nhelpers."\r\n\r\nSpeed Roggs, who had taken a couple of trips with Manton, was tall and\r\nthin as the barstool, and with a spaceman\'s ability to think fast when\r\nhe had to. Loudly he ordered a Venuswiz, explaining to a disgusted\r\nHenry, "After the barkeep mixes the drink he melts the swizzle stick and\r\npours that in, too." He gulped the stuff down gratefully, then said,\r\n"Tell me your troubles, Hank."\r\n\r\nHenry did. Speed Roggs looked disgusted. "Are you serious?" he asked,\r\nand when Henry swore to cut Speed\'s throat on asking that again, went\r\non, "Women are space-mad!"\r\n\r\nAs Henry agreed, Roggs said, "The one thing you don\'t understand about\r\nDon Manton is that he was maladjusted. He couldn\'t stay still, he always\r\nwanted what he couldn\'t have. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
That goes for his feelings for women,\r\ntoo."\r\n\r\nHenry looked up with bloodshot eyes nearly popping out of his head.\r\n\r\nRoggs kept going. "Don and Phoebe never got along once they were\r\nmarried. It was Manton\'s fault. Like all explorers he was unhappy over\r\nhis lot and looked beyond the rainbow. In fact, he told me once that the\r\nonly reason he went in for exploring space was to get away from his\r\nwife."\r\n\r\nHenry Weller suddenly rocked with laughter. He got to his feet, took\r\nRoggs, and went to his room, still laughing. He lay on the bed for half\r\nan hour. At the end of that time he sat up.\r\n\r\n"Tell the manager I won\'t be here for supper," he said to Speed. "I\'ve\r\ngot a little trip to make.

"\r\n\r\n"Where are you going?"\r\n\r\n"Home, to give the good tidings to my wife."\r\n\r\nHenry\'s fibroid house looked about the same. He parked the plane and let\r\nhimself in by the roof door and down the extension staircase. He found\r\nPhoebe in the kitchen bent over a pot, and at sound of him she turned. A\r\nnear-smile flickered in her blue eyes.\r\n\r\n"Phoebe ..."\r\n\r\n"Henry ..."\r\n\r\nThey laughed together. Henry wanted to tell her what he knew as bitterly\r\nand maliciously as possible, but he simply opened his mouth a few times.\r\nHe couldn\'t say it. Everyone is entitled to an illusion and this was\r\nPhoebe, his blonde wench, his wife, his woman. He looked a bit sick.\r\n\r\nShe smiled. "Come into the dining room."\r\n\r\nThe three-dimensional picture had been rolled up into the corner. Henry\r\npromised to put it away in the cellar and clean up the cellar as soon as\r\nhe could. Phoebe said that her first husband had never liked to stay\r\nhome, he\'d always been afraid to live normally.\r\n\r\n"I was wrong about the picture," she told him, "and I didn\'t know till I\r\nsaw you leave the house."\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that Henry and his Phoebe lived happily ever\r\nafter, but it is perhaps not so well known that Phoebe was left with a\r\nlittle disposal problem, too. She had a rough time finding a buyer (in\r\nsecret, of course) for her brand-new humandroid, who looked and behaved\r\nand talked so exactly like that well-known flyer, Speed Roggs....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Imagination Stories of Science and\r\n    Fantasy_ August 1953.
