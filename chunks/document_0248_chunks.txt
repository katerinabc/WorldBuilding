All they had to do was ban sex and\r\n                tobacco to those over thirty-five...._\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Worlds of If Science Fiction, August 1958.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nChuck Dane patted shaving lotion on his face, enjoying the second of\r\nvicious sting. He closed the medicine cabinet and stood for a minute\r\nexamining himself in the fluorescent lighted mirror. He was lean and\r\nhard and, of course, tanned. A few grey hairs flecked the sideburns,\r\nbut he didn\'t think that he looked thirty-five. And, damn it all to\r\nhell! he didn\'t feel thirty-five!\r\n\r\nHe opened the bathroom door, and hesitated. He dreaded to walk through\r\nthe photoelectric beam and set off that odious disc! Sometimes he got\r\ndown on hands and knees and crawled under. But he felt so damn silly!\r\n\r\nWell, he couldn\'t stand there all day. It was Monday and they would\r\nexpect him at the office.\r\n\r\nHe squared his shoulders and walked into the hall.\r\n\r\n    "Lung Cancer, Heart Attacks!\r\n    Heart Attacks, Lung Cancer!\r\n    Beware, old man, Be ... ware!

=== Chunk 2 ===
"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe tinkly message followed him up the hall. "I could jam the damn\r\nthing!" he thought, "but they\'d only repair it at daily Gov-Apts\r\nInspection and report me again!"\r\n\r\nHe pushed his hands into his pants pockets and walked into the dining\r\nell. He slouched in his chair, and watched Sally swish back and forth\r\nfrom the kitchen as she set the table. She was in blue nylon pajamas\r\nand fuzzy blue mules. Her red hair was tied up in a provocative pony\r\ntail.\r\n\r\nShe felt him watching her, gave him a devilish grin. "Sleep well last\r\nnight, dear? 

=== Chunk 3 ===
In your own little bed?"\r\n\r\n"You know damn well I didn\'t!" God, he wanted a cigarette. After two\r\nyears he still wanted one! When would the hunger for them ever stop?\r\n\r\n"You knew where I was sleeping. The door was unlocked!"\r\n\r\nShe came to him, suddenly compassionate, and sat on his lap. She pulled\r\nhis head against her. He felt, on his face, the slickness of the nylon,\r\nand underneath her firm body. She whispered, "You know honey, no matter\r\nwhat the government says, I\'m not made for sleeping alone!"\r\n\r\n"And I\'m thirty-five and not \'spose to!"\r\n\r\n"Thirty-five and eighty-nine days! How well I know! 

=== Chunk 4 ===
The toast!"\r\n\r\nShe scooted off his lap and ran into the kitchen. How she managed to\r\nburn toast in an electronic toaster beat him. By sending it down twice,\r\nhe suspected.\r\n\r\nHe picked up the paper by his plate and unfolded it. The first page, as\r\nusual, was devoted to the Propagandists. Headlines proclaimed: "375\r\ndied this weekend doing _you know what_." The second line asked: "Will\r\nyou be next?"\r\n\r\nIt made a good story because only three hundred deaths had been\r\npredicted. The bottom half of the page was filled with pictures of\r\nthe victims and the spouses who "lead them on, knowing at the time\r\nthat over forty percent of the heart attacks in men and women over\r\nthirty-five are brought on by sexual relations."\r\n\r\nSally was leaning over him, serving his plate with scrambled eggs and\r\nham, but he tried to ignore her and turned to the next page. Here was\r\nan editorial by the Department of Health. He scanned it. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Same old\r\nthing. Sex to be avoided like poison by all persons, male and female,\r\nover thirty-five years.\r\n\r\nChuck forked a piece of soya bread, and swabbed the last of ham grease\r\nand egg from his plate. He sat drinking his soya hot chocolate, and\r\nwanting a cigarette.\r\n\r\nSally finished eating, stretched, and the nylon threatened to rip. She\r\nwent and got his suit coat and hat. At the door he tried to kiss her\r\ngoodbye in his best "big brother" manner. But she clinched in close,\r\nand suddenly he didn\'t feel like a brother.\r\n\r\nShe whispered in his ear, "Come on back. I\'ll call and tell them you\r\ncaught a virus!"\r\n\r\nHe almost took off his hat. Then he said, "You know it would show up\r\nin my weekly S-Count!" He shuddered just saying the words. God! how he\r\nhated that! He continued, "And if I slip once or twice on that, you\r\nknow what they do."\r\n\r\nFeeling sorry for her, he added half-heartedly, "But you\'re only\r\nthirty. And I wouldn\'t blame you.... Lot of people do, you know."\r\n\r\nShe leaned back, still in his arms, and laughed up at him. "No, I\'ll\r\nwait and break you down!"\r\n\r\n"Even knowing what they\'re likely to do?"\r\n\r\n"But surely! Then at least the temptation wouldn\'t be so handy!"\r\n\r\nHe walked rapidly toward the office. Other groups walked along talking\r\nand laughing. Here and there someone called to him.\r\n\r\nHe came to U.S. 75, a deserted graying eight lane strip. As he started\r\nacross, a bike came over the rise and he dived into the ditch. But\r\nit was only a Catholic priest pedalling furiously along on a girl\'s\r\nbicycle. Then there had been another clash! He climbed out of the\r\nditch, and walked a ways down the highway. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
There it was. The priest was\r\njust climbing off the bike, and there was a motorcycle cop.\r\n\r\nChuck Dane walked up the highway to the scene and stood watching. The\r\npriest was kneeling, his black bag open, administering last rites to\r\nthe two youths.\r\n\r\nThe cop, fat and redfaced, came over and stood beside Chuck. "Two less\r\nTeenagers!" he grinned.\r\n\r\n"Dying, eh?" Chuck asked.\r\n\r\n"Dying or dead! These damn kids!" He said it with just a tinge of envy.\r\n\r\nThe Father snapped his bag shut, and pedalled away. Chuck went over\r\nfor a closer look. Both of the kids were on roller skates, the powered\r\nkind. Chuck Dane noted with satisfaction that they were Airex skates.\r\n\r\nBoth of the kids had on the regular uniform, black leather jackets,\r\nand leather belts eight inches wide. Mounted on the center front of\r\nthe belts were the regulation three foot razor sharp spears. Only now\r\nthere was not much of the spears to be seen. Because neither kid had\r\nchickened. The shorter boy had caught a spear in the lower chest, and\r\nthe taller one caught it in the guts.\r\n\r\nFunny, Chuck Dane thought, staring down at them. Even in this cotton\r\nbatting, vacuum world of 1990 the Teenagers could find ways to kill\r\neach other off! He envied them their spirit!\r\n\r\nHe waved at the cop, who was calling in a report, and walked back up\r\nthe highway. When he got to his usual place, he started to cross.\r\n\r\n"Ol\xc3\xa1!"\r\n\r\nIn that frantic second, he saw only the black leather jacket bearing\r\ndown upon him. And the bike with the spear mounted on the handlebars,\r\nthe tip sparkling like a diamond in the sun. It swerved, and came\r\nstraight for him. Chuck dived into the ditch, even as he felt it prick\r\nhis coat.\r\n\r\nThe kid yelled, "Cock-a-doodle-do!" and pedalled on.\r\n\r\nChuck climbed up out of the ditch and ran across the highway. Then\r\nhe straightened his clothing, dusted himself off. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
This was damn\r\nundignified! He hated the kid, wanted to kill him with his bare hands.\r\n\r\nHe walked along, thinking how it had all come about. First it had been\r\nthe highway death toll. When it had reached over two thousand on week\r\ndays, and ten thousand on weekends, the government had stepped in.\r\nTheir solution had been simple and foolproof. They simply taxed gas out\r\nof sight. Now the oil companies exported their total output, and were\r\nmaking more money than ever.\r\n\r\nThen some fool in the A.M.A. had pointed out that almost as many people\r\nwere dying of lung cancer as had previously fallen on the ribbons of\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nAt first Congress had passed a bill to ban the manufacture of all\r\ncigarettes. But the black market flourished and the psychiatrists\r\nyelped. They yelped that the approach to the problem was all wrong,\r\ndue to the fact that they hadn\'t been consulted. This was warping\r\npersonalities and making martyrs out of cigarette users. The way to do\r\nit, they said, was to have tobacco products available, but to shame\r\npeople into giving them up of their own free wills.\r\n\r\nThey theorized that a cigarette smoker is really a frustrated person\r\nunable to cope with the adult world. When he puts a cig between his\r\nlips he is really searching for his mother\'s nipple. Therefore, the\r\nthing to do is to force him to out-grow this, rather than take it\r\nforcibly away from him. Same way with a cigar smoker or pipe smoker.\r\n\r\nThe psychiatric lobby prevailed and the government repealed the\r\ntobacco bill. And replaced it with another. Now it was the law for all\r\ncigarettes, cigars and pipe tobacco to have an hallucination inducing\r\ndrug, Xlene 91, in them. Also, as was compulsory, all cigars, pipes and\r\ncigarettes sported rubber filters shaped like nipples.\r\n\r\nThen, Chuck Dane reminisced, with lung cancer dropping off steadily,\r\nthey had started in to curb heart attacks. And taken away the only\r\npleasure a guy had left!\r\n\r\nHe was in sight of his place of work now. A huge half-circle of\r\nplexiglass that was Airex Roller Skating Factory. Chuck thought as he\r\nentered the building, that four hours was a hell of a long working day,\r\nespecially doing material control posting all that time. He hoped the\r\nbill to change working hours to three hours would pass soon....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt two o\'clock in the afternoon, Chuck lined up with the rest of the\r\noffice force to walk single file past the hidden electronic camera. Out\r\nof habit, he held his right hand in salute position, palm toward the\r\ncamera. These deals had been interesting when they first replaced the\r\nold style time clocks, now they were routine.\r\n\r\nAs the queue neared the door where the company\'s three psychiatrists\r\nstood, Chuck got more and more nervous. Suppose they could read his\r\nmind, or something!\r\n\r\nSure enough, Doctor Benton wiggled a finger for him to step out of\r\nline. He took him to one side, and peered into his face. Chuck tried to\r\nlook into the green eyes, so calm and assured, but he had to look away.\r\n\r\n"You okay, Dane?"\r\n\r\n"Sure! Tired, that\'s all. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
Helluva long day!"\r\n\r\n"Yes. Well, you come in and see me tomorrow. We\'ll have us a little\r\ntalk."\r\n\r\nRapidly, Chuck left the building. He muttered, "Like hell we will,\r\nHeadshrinker!"\r\n\r\nFurtively, he left the usual road home, and walked into a corner\r\ndrugstore. He stood around with his hands in his pockets, until all the\r\nother customers cleared out.\r\n\r\n"Puffies," he said.\r\n\r\nThe big man behind the counter tried to hitch his belt over his paunch.\r\n"Sure you know what you\'re doin\', Bud? Have to take your number you\r\nknow."\r\n\r\nChuck didn\'t answer. He pulled his right hand out of his pocket and\r\nlaid it palm up on the glass counter top. The man wrote down the id\r\nnumber and handed over the cigarettes.\r\n\r\nChuck walked on home, with the Puffies a guilty lump in his jacket\r\npocket. He felt sure everybody he met knew what he was up to.\r\n\r\nAt home, Chuck stuck his head in the kitchen and said "Hi" to Sally.\r\nHe resisted patting her. He went to the den and locked the door with\r\ntrembling fingers, then sat at the desk and took out his knife. He cut\r\noff the realistic red nipples from all twenty cigarettes, and made a\r\npyre of them in the middle of the glass top. Then he set fire to them,\r\nnot minding the acrid smoke.\r\n\r\nHe put a cigarette to his lips. Still he hesitated, fearing the\r\nhallucinations, about which he had heard but never experienced.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he grinned and leaned back, lit up and closed his eyes. The\r\nparade of pictures began in front of his eyeballs. First a picture of\r\nhuman lungs, and slowly the cancer virus invades them and eats them\r\naway. Then the parade of men and women clutching their chests, writhing\r\nin death throes. Chuck Dane smiled, enjoying each hallucination.\r\nPretending that the unlucky victims were the Propagandists.\r\n\r\nHe lit another cigarette from the butt of the first one, and leaned\r\nback, feeling his lungs pleasantly saturated with smoke.\r\n\r\nWhen ten cigarettes were snubbed in a row on the glass top of the desk,\r\nhe stopped and mused. Now, he guessed he would die of cancer for sure.\r\nHe wondered how long....\r\n\r\nThen another thought hit him. With two temptations, he wondered why he\r\nhad given in to the cigarette first.\r\n\r\nHe lit another Puffie and leaned back in the chair and closed his eyes.\r\nA perfect technicolor picture of Sally crossed his mind, swishing the\r\npony tail provocatively. He got up. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
Left the den. Went to the kitchen\r\nand leaned in the door watching her.\r\n\r\nTomorrow was Tuesday. His day for S-Count. But he wouldn\'t submit to\r\nthat again. Or have that little talk with Doctor Benton. Tomorrow,\r\ngoing to work, when he crossed U.S. 75 he would give some Teenager a\r\nhell of a thrill! But tonight ... tonight....\r\n\r\n"Come here, baby!" he whispered harshly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s The Downhill Side of Thirty, by Virgil F.
