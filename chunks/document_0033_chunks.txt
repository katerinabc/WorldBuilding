From outside the door he\r\ncaught a thought wave equivalent to a knock, and, glancing at the door,\r\nhe willed it to slide open.\r\n\r\nIt opened. "Enter, my friend," he said. He could have projected the idea\r\ntelepathically; but with only two persons present, speech was more\r\npolite.\r\n\r\nEjon Khee entered. "You are up late tonight, my leader," he said.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Khee. Within an hour the Earth rocket is due to land, and I wish\r\nto see it. Yes, I know, it will land a thousand miles away, if their\r\ncalculations are correct. Beyond the horizon. But if it lands even twice\r\nthat far the flash of the atomic explosion should be visible. And I have\r\nwaited long for first contact. For even though no Earthman will be on\r\nthat rocket, it will still be first contact--for them. Of course our\r\ntelepath teams have been reading their thoughts for many centuries,\r\nbut--this will be the first _physical_ contact between Mars and Earth."\r\n\r\nKhee made himself comfortable on one of the low chairs.

"True," he said.\r\n"I have not followed recent reports too closely, though. Why are they\r\nusing an atomic warhead? I know they suppose our planet is uninhabited,\r\nbut still--"\r\n\r\n"They will watch the flash through their lunar telescopes and get\r\na--what do they call it?--a spectroscopic analysis. That will tell them\r\nmore than they know now (or think they know; much of it is erroneous)\r\nabout the atmosphere of our planet and the composition of its surface.\r\nIt is--call it a sighting shot, Khee. They\'ll be here in person within a\r\nfew oppositions. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
And then--"\r\n\r\nMars was holding out, waiting for Earth to come. What was left of Mars,\r\nthat is; this one small city of about nine hundred beings. The\r\ncivilization of Mars was older than that of Earth, but it was a dying\r\none. This was what remained of it: one city, nine hundred people. They\r\nwere waiting for Earth to make contact, for a selfish reason and for an\r\nunselfish one.\r\n\r\n\r\nMartian civilization had developed in a quite different direction from\r\nthat of Earth. It had developed no important knowledge of the physical\r\nsciences, no technology. But it had developed social sciences to the\r\npoint where there had not been a single crime, let alone a war, on\r\nMars for fifty thousand years. And it had developed fully the\r\nparapsychological sciences of the mind, which Earth was just beginning\r\nto discover.\r\n\r\nMars could teach Earth much. How to avoid crime and war to begin with.\r\nBeyond those simple things lay telepathy, telekinesis, empathy....\r\n\r\nAnd Earth would, Mars hoped, teach them something even more valuable to\r\nMars: how, by science and technology--which it was too late for Mars to\r\ndevelop now, even if they had the type of minds which would enable them\r\nto develop these things--to restore and rehabilitate a dying planet, so\r\nthat an otherwise dying race might live and multiply again.\r\n\r\nEach planet would gain greatly, and neither would lose.\r\n\r\nAnd tonight was the night when Earth would make its first sighting shot.\r\nIts next shot, a rocket containing Earthmen, or at least an Earthman,\r\nwould be at the next opposition, two Earth years, or roughly four\r\nMartian years, hence. The Martians knew this, because their teams of\r\ntelepaths were able to catch at least some of the thoughts of Earthmen,\r\nenough to know their plans. Unfortunately, at that distance, the\r\nconnection was one-way. Mars could not ask Earth to hurry its program.\r\nOr tell Earth scientists the facts about Mars\' composition and\r\natmosphere which would have made this preliminary shot unnecessary.\r\n\r\nTonight Ry, the leader (as nearly as the Martian word can be\r\ntranslated), and Khee, his administrative assistant and closest friend,\r\nsat and meditated together until the time was near. Then they drank a\r\ntoast to the future--in a beverage based on menthol, which had the same\r\neffect on Martians as alcohol on Earthmen--and climbed to the roof of\r\nthe building in which they had been sitting. They watched toward the\r\nnorth, where the rocket should land. The stars shone brilliantly and\r\nunwinkingly through the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Observatory No. 1 on Earth\'s moon, Rog Everett, his eye at the\r\neyepiece of the spotter scope, said triumphantly, "Thar she blew,\r\nWillie. And now, as soon as the films are developed, we\'ll know the\r\nscore on that old planet Mars." He straightened up--there\'d be no more\r\nto see now--and he and Willie Sanger shook hands solemnly. It was an\r\nhistorical occasion.\r\n\r\n"Hope it didn\'t kill anybody. Any Martians, that is. Rog, did it hit\r\ndead center in Syrtis Major?"\r\n\r\n"Near as matters. I\'d say it was maybe a thousand miles off, to the\r\nsouth. And that\'s damn close on a fifty-million-mile shot. Willie, do\r\nyou really think there are any Martians?"\r\n\r\nWillie thought a second and then said, "No."\r\n\r\nHe was right.\r\n\r\n\r\n  --FREDRIC BROWN\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
