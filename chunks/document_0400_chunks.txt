His thoughts\r\n          were of his wife and son, but duty demanded that--\r\n\r\n                      A Soldier\'s Home Is Battle\r\n\r\n                            By Lowell Stone\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Imagination Stories of Science and Fantasy\r\n                              March 1954\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the time the radar signal caught their eye it was too late to do\r\nanything. Planes traveling faster than sound were already inside the\r\ndefense zone of the city.\r\n\r\nPrivate First Class Jerry Conlon glanced from the radar screen to\r\nthe other five members of his Atomic Gun Post team on the outer\r\nperimeter of the city. The look in their eyes was one of dazed alarm.\r\nAutomatically he joined them in zipping shut radiation suits, and then\r\nthey went for the gun controls, knowing it was too late.\r\n\r\nA flash of intolerable brightness faded out the sun. One of the\r\nboys--Conlon saw him still struggling with his radiation suit--didn\'t\r\nmake it in time. He paid for his slowness with his life.\r\n\r\nIn that instant of death before his eyes, Jerry thought of his wife\r\nand baby son. It was all he had time for. Just the image in his mind.\r\nAn image of fear, because he wondered about them--were they dying even\r\nnow?\r\n\r\nWith the great flash Jerry dropped into the prone position that he\'d\r\nbeen taught. He was protected because the Gun Post had been holed into\r\nthe ground and re-enforced with steel-mesh concrete all around. If you\r\nsee the flash, it\'s too late, he\'d been told. Well, he\'d seen the flash\r\nall right. When he dropped to the concrete base, the floor rose to meet\r\nhim halfway. A few seconds later, the suction raised him off the floor\r\nand set him down next to the big gun.\r\n\r\nJerry crawled back to the protection of the bulwark. He had a hazy\r\nglimpse of movement around him, but he couldn\'t see well enough out of\r\nhis blinded eyes to make out what the others were doing. Things were\r\nbeginning to rain down out of the sky now, and it continued to rain for\r\nwhat seemed to Jerry like five or ten minutes. It was fantastic how\r\nhigh some of the debris must have been blasted into the air, and he\r\nwas afraid to move for a long time lest a rock or bit of metal should\r\nsuddenly streak down.\r\n\r\nIt was mostly just the smaller pieces that got as far as the Post. The\r\nbiggest chunks had either been completely disintegrated or splattered\r\nalong the ground in all directions from the target area. It had been\r\na direct hit. It only took one blast, but that didn\'t mean it was the\r\nonly one in the country. When the attack came, every big city had\r\nprobably been marked for destruction.\r\n\r\nEvery big city! The thought struck him with sickening force. His wife\r\nand little boy--Mildred and Billy! How about them? Had the blasts gone\r\ninland?\r\n\r\n"Conlon, are you all right?"\r\n\r\nThe sound of the voice stabbed at Jerry. He studied the wavering dark\r\nform in front of his eyes, and recognition of the voice came slowly.\r\nThe white blob of the face must belong to Lieutenant Blake. Ordinarily\r\nJerry would have snapped to attention and saluted, but at the moment\r\nthe formality seemed ridiculous.\r\n\r\n"I guess I\'m all right, sir."\r\n\r\n"Good!" That was all Blake said as he passed from Jerry\'s view.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Jerry\'s earphones it sounded like a strong wind was blowing. It\r\ncould be the roar of a fleet of rocket planes. Was this the follow-up\r\nattack? Why wasn\'t the order given to man the gun? He groped forward\r\nand sprawled over a pile of debris. Where was everybody? Where was\r\nBlake? He called out.\r\n\r\n"Take it easy, Conlon," a voice said beside him.\r\n\r\n"Who--who is it?" Jerry asked, trying to determine the source of the\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n"It\'s me--Adam Peterman. You\'ll be all right after awhile. What\'d you\r\ndo--look into the flash?"\r\n\r\n"I saw the flash. Good God! Am I going blind?"\r\n\r\n"I once looked at a test blast with a radiation suit on. They still\r\nhaven\'t perfected these lenses to shut out all the glare. You\'ll be\r\nlike that for a couple of hours.

=== Chunk 2 ===
"\r\n\r\n"How many of the boys did the blast get?"\r\n\r\nHere he was, Jerry thought, asking about the six men in the gun crew\r\nwhen there must have been thousands--maybe millions--dead in the city,\r\nor what must be left of it.\r\n\r\n"There\'s just three of us alive so far," Peterman said. "The\r\nLieutenant found Kroger, but he\'d been crushed. The rest are either\r\nburied or blown away.

=== Chunk 3 ===
"\r\n\r\n"How about you? I still can\'t see where you are," Jerry said. "Are you\r\nhurt?"\r\n\r\n"My legs got messed up. I\'m sitting on the ground. That\'s why you can\'t\r\nsee me."\r\n\r\n"What about the city? What\'s left of it?"\r\n\r\n"From where I\'m sitting I should be able to see the tops of some of the\r\ntaller buildings over the concrete, but there\'s nothing there. I hate\r\nto think about it."\r\n\r\n"If there is anything left, the rocket planes will bring \'em down."\r\n\r\n"What rocket planes?"\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you hear \'em? That roar in the air. It almost drowns out the\r\ngeiger meter on my suit."\r\n\r\n"Naw, Conlon, that isn\'t what you think! You\'re still hearing the sound\r\nof the blast."\r\n\r\n"After this long?"\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t die out for a long time."\r\n\r\nJerry thought about Mildred and Billy. It was this bad even in a\r\nradiation suit with special lenses to protect the eyes; special braces\r\nto minimize the shock wave effects; special material perfected during\r\nthe latter part of the century to deflect ultra-radiation. How would\r\nMildred and Billy fare back home where they were unprotected? They\r\nmight even be dead. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
But no! 

=== Chunk 5 ===
They couldn\'t be! They were all he had\r\nleft in life. They just had to be alive!\r\n\r\nThe shadowy blob which was Lieutenant Blake, moved into Jerry\'s line\r\nof vision. Blake\'s form seemed to be getting smaller now; the haziness\r\naround the edges seemed to be dwindling.\r\n\r\n"How are you Peterman?" Blake asked the man with the wounded legs.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll make it all right, Lieutenant. I might even be able to sight the\r\ngun if you lift me into the seat."\r\n\r\n"Good man, Peterman!" Blake turned to Jerry, "Well, Conlon, it looks\r\nlike you and I are the only ones on our feet. That means we\'ve got work\r\nto do."\r\n\r\n"My eyes are bad, but I think they\'re clearing up now," Jerry said.\r\n\r\n"Things are pretty rough," Blake said. "From what I\'ve been able to\r\ndetermine, the whole nation\'s been blasted."\r\n\r\n"Lieutenant--no!" Jerry cried. He moved forward toward the Lieutenant\r\nand clutched Blake by the shoulders. "I\'ve got a wife and kid back\r\nhome!"\r\n\r\n"We all have relatives back home, Conlon. You\'re no different than\r\nanybody else. And it\'s just as bad for us as it is for you. You\'ve got\r\nto get a grip on yourself. There\'s nothing you can do for them one way\r\nor the other."\r\n\r\n"The hell there isn\'t! 

=== Chunk 6 ===
I\'m going back to \'em!"\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant\'s covered hand whipped out and slapped the front of\r\nJerry\'s helmet below the vision lens. Jerry went backwards and dropped\r\nto the concrete floor.\r\n\r\n"Sorry, Conlon," Blake clipped. "I didn\'t do that in anger. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
I merely\r\nwanted to snap you back to your senses! You\'re still in the Army, and\r\nI\'m still your commanding officer. As far as the Army is concerned,\r\nnone of us have any relatives."\r\n\r\nJerry got to his feet. There was no question that the Lieutenant was\r\nright. The Army was the big boss, and soldiers were not supposed to\r\nhave personal feelings. There were several million soldiers protecting\r\nmany millions of people and the only way that Mildred and Billy could\r\nbe protected was through the combined and strategic effort of these\r\nsoldiers. There were soldiers in the interior risking their lives to\r\nprotect people like Mildred and Billy--soldiers with relatives in the\r\ncity that Jerry was supposed to protect. It would be a sorry plight if,\r\nat the first sign of trouble, all the men would run home to their own\r\nlittle families.\r\n\r\nIt all seemed like a crazy nightmare to Jerry. No matter how big the\r\ncatastrophe, human beings still worried about the little problems\r\nalong with the big. It was a strange feeling to look over the top of\r\nthe bulwark and see nothing but the dirty gray sky where the forms of\r\nbig buildings should be. The shock was less horrible to him because\r\nby the time his sight returned, he was accepting the awful scene of\r\ndestruction as an unchangeable fact.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was several hours later before a small contingent of radiation\r\nclothed soldiers arrived in several jeeps. A Colonel of the Army\r\nstepped out. Blake and Conlon stood at attention as the officers\r\nintroduced themselves. The Colonel\'s name was Harrison.\r\n\r\n"I\'m trying to find out what we have to work with. Not much, I\'m\r\nafraid," the Colonel said. "The Government\'s gone. Communication is\r\ndisrupted."\r\n\r\n"Did you say there was no more government, Colonel?" Jerry asked.\r\n\r\nThe Colonel nodded. "That\'s what I said."\r\n\r\n"Then there\'s no hope--nothing left to fight for any more?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing to fight for?" the Colonel snorted. "Soldier, as long as we\r\nhave our hills and valleys we\'ll have something to fight for!"\r\n\r\nLieutenant Blake said, "Private Conlon, no more of that defeatist talk!\r\nPlease excuse him, Colonel."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all right," the Colonel shrugged. "It\'s been a shock to all of\r\nus. Now, tell me, how are you fixed?"\r\n\r\n"Two able, counting myself. One bad casualty. One dead. Three missing,"\r\nBlake said.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll have one man replacement."\r\n\r\n"But, Colonel, that isn\'t enough to man the gun!"\r\n\r\n"Apparently you don\'t realize what\'s happened to the country,\r\nLieutenant! We\'re not attempting to hold back the enemy. When they come\r\nthey\'re going to flow right over us as though we aren\'t here."\r\n\r\n"Then what\'s the point of--"\r\n\r\n"The point is this. We have not received an order to surrender. We\r\nprobably never will."\r\n\r\nBlake said, "We\'ll do the best we can, Colonel."\r\n\r\nThe Colonel gave an order and one man crawled out of a jeep and strode\r\ntoward them. The soldier saluted.\r\n\r\n"He is your replacement, Lieutenant," the Colonel said. Then he shook\r\nhands with Blake. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
"Goodbye, and good luck!"\r\n\r\nThe jeeps growled into life. It was strange hearing them, Jerry\r\nthought. Usually there was the hum of the city in the background, a\r\nsort of whispering that made you realize a throbbing community was\r\nnearby. Now it was only the silence broken by the raucous sound of jeep\r\nmotors. Eventually even this sound disappeared.\r\n\r\n"All right, men, start clearing up this mess," Blake snapped. "The\r\ngun has to have free traverse. After that, stay at your posts. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
It\'s\r\ngoing to be tough to handle this assignment short-handed, and when the\r\nsecondary attack comes it\'s going to roll in like a tidal wave."\r\n\r\nThe replacement was hardly more than a kid. Jerry thought he looked\r\nas though he could be pushed over with a heavy breath. Not much of a\r\nreplacement, but he pitched into work earnestly.\r\n\r\nJerry edged close to Peterman as he worked. The wounded man sat propped\r\nagainst a pile with his legs stretched out uselessly in front.\r\n\r\n"They didn\'t even offer to give you medical aid, Peterman," Jerry said.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t expect it at a time like this," Peterman said. "The men that\r\nare left have their hands full.

=== Chunk 10 ===
"\r\n\r\n"For what? You heard what the Colonel said, the Government is\r\ngone--possibly the whole country! What we\'re doing isn\'t even a\r\ndelaying action. We\'re hardly going to harass the Enemy! What\'s the\r\ngood of hanging on? Why doesn\'t the Army turn us loose? I\'ve got to\r\nfind out how my wife and kid are doing! Staying here only means one\r\nthing--one foolish, stupid thing!"\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got a point, Conlon," Peterman said through his pain. "I\'ve got\r\na family too. I\'d be tempted to take off myself, if I had legs."\r\n\r\n"Duty! Allegiance! 

=== Chunk 11 ===
What does it all mean now?" Jerry said bitterly.\r\n\r\n"Not much I suppose, when they pull the curtain in front of you."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJerry was breathing hard inside his radiation suit. "Peterman, I\'ve got\r\na notion to make a break!"\r\n\r\n"That decision you\'ve got to make yourself, Conlon. Only remember, that\r\nleaving your post gives the Lieutenant the right to shoot you in the\r\nback!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll take that chance. 

=== Chunk 12 ===
I\'ve got to see Mildred and Billy. You think\r\nyou\'d do the same thing, Peterman, if you had legs? Would you?"\r\n\r\n"I might. I don\'t know. I\'m in no position to give it much thought."\r\n\r\n"But don\'t you think this is stupid to wait for certain death when\r\nthere\'s no hope--when I\'ve got the chance to see the ones I love, maybe\r\nfor the last time?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s stupid all right I guess."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got loved ones, haven\'t you, Peterman? You know how much it\r\nmeans?" Peterman clammed and refused to talk.\r\n\r\nJerry went to the storage which was built into the side of the\r\nconcrete wall, opened the door, and brought out his rifle. He examined\r\nthe automatic weapon and found it undamaged. He looked around.\r\nLieutenant Blake was out of sight inside the dugout where he was still\r\ntrying to pick up messages. The replacement was mechanically heaving\r\ndebris away from the traverse frame of the big gun.\r\n\r\n"Conlon." It was Peterman calling.\r\n\r\n"What do you want?"\r\n\r\n"There\'s only one thing I\'d like you to do before you leave. You and\r\nthe replacement lift me to the gunner\'s seat, will you? I have a bad\r\ndose of radiation on top of everything else. I don\'t know how long I\r\ncan hold out, but I might as well be doing some good for the time I\r\nhave left."\r\n\r\nJerry put the rifle down, called to the replacement. Together they\r\nhoisted Peterman into the seat. Lieutenant Blake came out just as they\r\nfinished the job.\r\n\r\n"That\'s what he wanted, sir," Jerry said. "You\'re so short-handed we\r\ndidn\'t think you\'d object."\r\n\r\nBlake said, "Peterman, you should be keeping yourself quiet."\r\n\r\nPeterman failed to answer for a long moment. Finally he said, "Damn the\r\nEnemy! Why don\'t they hurry up and get it over with?"\r\n\r\nJerry walked over to where he had stacked his automatic rifle. He swung\r\nit under his arm and turned to face the Lieutenant.\r\n\r\n"I\'m leaving, sir. Don\'t try to stop me! 

=== Chunk 13 ===
What we\'re doing here is plain\r\nstupid. I\'ve got a wife and kid that I\'ve got to see before I die! I\'m\r\nleaving, and I\'ll shoot to kill if anybody tries to stop me! Got that,\r\nLieutenant?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not going to stop you, Conlon," Blake said quietly.\r\n\r\n"I hope the rest of you can manage the gun while I\'m gone!" Jerry cried.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll manage all right until you get back."\r\n\r\nA faint far-away roar sounded in Jerry\'s earphones. The sound became\r\nrapidly louder. "No sense in me coming back, Lieutenant, because from\r\nthe sound of things, you won\'t be around much longer."\r\n\r\nJerry backed toward the concrete steps that would take him to ground\r\nlevel. He climbed up, kicking away litter so that he would have places\r\nfor his feet. He kept the rifle pointed at the motionless, watching\r\nmen. The roar became louder.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Blake called up to him. "You\'re from the inland area, aren\'t\r\nyou, Conlon? I think the chances for your family were pretty good.\r\nEmergency stations are starting to come through from the interior. The\r\nguided missiles had a lot of near-misses."\r\n\r\nOut of the corners of Jerry\'s eyes he detected a strange looking dark\r\ncloud appearing along the horizon. From the west, not the east! That\r\nwas odd. The dark cloud spread across the horizon, coming closer.\r\nRocket planes! Hundreds of them!\r\n\r\nJerry was at ground level now. Up here there would be no protection. A\r\nblast and shock wave could sweep across the flat ground unhindered. The\r\nroar became deafening. Now he could recognize the ships. They were Army\r\nComets!\r\n\r\nHe wanted to leap with joy. His spine tingled with excitement. The\r\ncloud was roaring overhead now. The Comets flashed onward, bent on a\r\npurpose, a death-dealing, earth-shaking purpose! That\'s the way the\r\nEnemy had wanted it. The Enemy had chosen its weapon, and the Army was\r\non its way to blow the Enemy so sky-high that its own attack on Jerry\'s\r\nhomeland would seem insignificant by comparison.\r\n\r\nJerry tossed his rifle over the edge of the bulwark. The thunder\r\noverhead snuffed out the clatter of the rifle when it struck the\r\nconcrete below. Jerry went down the steps holding his hands over\r\nhis head. 

=== Chunk 14 ===
It was a full minute before he stumbled back to where he\r\nhad started. "I changed my mind about leaving, Lieutenant!" Jerry\r\nshouted. He might as well have been trying to shout above the roar of a\r\nhurricane.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant waved Jerry\'s arms down, and Jerry was close enough to\r\ndetect a smile inside the Lieutenant\'s helmet. Blake turned and walked\r\naway in the direction of the dugout as though nothing had happened.\r\n\r\nJerry pointed skyward, and the men wagged their heads understandingly.\r\n\r\n"Hell," Jerry cried, "this war isn\'t over yet!"\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
