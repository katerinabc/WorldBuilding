When he disappeared three years ago, somewhere in the\r\nunexplored wilderness of southern Mars, his loss was mourned not only\r\nby the Terran Museum of Natural History, for whom he worked, but by a\r\nmultitude of lovers of adventure by proxy, as well, who kept up with\r\nhis astounding fortunes through their daily papers.\r\n\r\nFor George Seeling, who feared nothing that walked, crawled, flew, or\r\npulsed, and who owned, moreover, a shining pair of seven league boots,\r\nin the form of an inexhaustible expense account, believed in sharing\r\nhimself with the public. He adored publicity.\r\n\r\nThere was the time, for instance, that he made off with the crown\r\njewels of the Tsarn Princess of Ganymede. The people loved it. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
All of\r\nthem excepting, of course, the Ganymedians. They were considerably\r\nupset, but being a minority group, there was not much that they could\r\ndo, once Seeling had escaped with the jewels.\r\n\r\nThen there was the celebrated occasion of his robbing the crypts of\r\nNakor, the Moon Goddess of Io. From Io he swiped several golden idols\r\nof inestimable value, which was just as well, for they were not doing\r\nthe natives the least bit of good, despite their complaints. It almost\r\ncaused an international incident, but the Museum kept the treasure, and\r\ntheir procurer collected a fat commission.\r\n\r\nThis, as one can readily see, demonstrates graphically that George\r\nSeeling felt almost as much at home in tombs as he did in the public\r\neye.\r\n\r\nThe south of Mars is a rugged land of naked, red peaks and deep,\r\nimpassable canyons; of reed-filled swamp lands and barren plateaus. The\r\npeople who live there are primitive, and thin as greyhounds, but of a\r\nshy, gentle nature, with huge, dark, melting eyes set deep in leathery,\r\npurplish skin, and nervous, splayed bare feet that can pad the sands\r\nof the uplands at incredible speed.\r\n\r\nTo George Seeling the ghels were merely an incidental impression to\r\nadd to the menagerie of weird people from many worlds that already\r\nstuffed his brain and made him rather a cosmopolitan with regard to\r\nalien cultures. He had already spent several weeks on Mars; most of it\r\nin Parthena, the chief spaceport of southern Mars, where he haunted the\r\nbars of the native district, asking, seeking, wheedling, bribing, until\r\nhe found what he sought--a man who could lead him to one of the old\r\ncities that lay hidden back in the hills.\r\n\r\nSo it came about that he landed himself and his guide in a rented\r\n\'copter on a certain, uncharted mountainside to the south and west of\r\nParthena.\r\n\r\nThrough the field glasses, the minarets of the city were just visible,\r\nbut it was impossible to get any closer for there was no place to land.\r\nThe old Martians had been averse to flat roofs, a circumstance which\r\nled Seeling to doubt, audibly, that they could have had the sense of an\r\naddled eel.\r\n\r\nAfter loading himself down with the paraphernalia that explorers are\r\nsupposed to carry, he went on alone, the guide declining an invitation\r\nto accompany him.\r\n\r\nIt was almost dark when he stumbled over the first bit of masonry--some\r\nprehistoric curbstone, perhaps. He had walked for hours in a tangled\r\nforest of giant reeds, and the suddenness of his discovery startled him.\r\n\r\nHe had wandered right into the midst of the abandoned city without even\r\nknowing it. Such was the customary luck of George Seeling. He could see\r\nshadowy outlines of some of the eroding old towers from where he stood,\r\nbut he knew it was too late in the evening to explore them safely. He\r\nhad waited this long; it wouldn\'t hurt to wait through one more short,\r\nMartian night.\r\n\r\nHe found a clearing near a roofless columnar tower and spread his\r\nsleeping bag beneath its wall. He went to sleep elated with his good\r\nfortune, and slept dreamlessly, and without disturbance.\r\n\r\nBut then, it took a great deal to disturb George Seeling when he slept.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the morning the ghels were there. There were about a dozen of them,\r\nsilently squatting in a semi-circle about his camp, contemplating him\r\nat a respectful distance with their soulful, gazelle eyes.\r\n\r\nThere is something disconcerting about waking up and finding that one\r\nhas acquired uninvited guests, but Seeling never turned a hair. He\r\nreached over and grabbed his rifle, but the ghels never moved. They\r\nlooked, for all the world, like purple-brown graven images squatting\r\nthere, except that the round, black eyes blinked once in a while.\r\n\r\nThe ghel tongue was a very rudimentary one, and Seeling, who was\r\nnaturally adept at such things, had studied it at some length during\r\nthe weeks in Parthena. He felt that he could get along.\r\n\r\n"I greet you," he said, still fondling his rifle. "I am an Earthman."\r\n\r\n"We know," one of the ghels said in a curious, whistling voice. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
"What\r\ndo you want here?"\r\n\r\n"I come to see the city," George said.\r\n\r\n"This is the sacred dead city of Solon Regh, the wisest of the ancient\r\nones. We do not welcome visitors here."\r\n\r\n"It\'s not your city, dammit," George said.\r\n\r\n"What did you say?"\r\n\r\n"Sorry, I said, this is not the work of your race. Why do you care if I\r\nlook around?"\r\n\r\n"It is a shrine. The old ones took care of us before they went away. We\r\nloved them, and do not want their dead disturbed."\r\n\r\nGeorge Seeling grinned with delight. He never enjoyed himself so much\r\nas when he was where he wasn\'t supposed to be.\r\n\r\n"We would be very sad if the dead were desecrated," the ghel said.\r\n\r\n"Umm," said Seeling impudently, "but what would you do if I went ahead\r\nand desecrated them anyway?"\r\n\r\nThe head ghel looked shocked. He turned his saucer eyes on his\r\ncompanions, and they all squirmed on their haunches and looked shocked\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\n"We would be very sad," the ghel answered.\r\n\r\n"No hard feelings," George Seeling said, "but if the advancement of\r\nscience and the dispersal of knowledge were left up to you fellows, the\r\nworld would be in a hell of a fix." He aimed his rifle suggestively at\r\nthe ghel\'s chest. "Do you know what this is that I am pointing at you?"\r\n\r\n"It is a death stick. We have seen them before."\r\n\r\n"Right. Now, there\'s something you can do for me, and I\'ll take it very\r\nkindly if you cooperate."\r\n\r\n"Kindness is something we understand."\r\n\r\n"That\'s fine. Somewhere about here are the tombs of the old race. All\r\nthe legends of Mars tell about the wealth of the ancients, and I hear\r\nthis Solon Regh was sort of a Martian King Tut. Lead me there, and I\'ll\r\nbe kind enough to spare your life.

=== Chunk 4 ===
"\r\n\r\nThe ghels all blinked their eyes rapidly. Seeling fancied that there\r\nwould have been tears in their eyes, except that ghels have no tear\r\nglands. He felt a little sorry for them.\r\n\r\n"Come with us," the leader of the ghels said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSeeling was properly impressed. He had seen enough of the old cultures\r\nof the planets to realize that here, indeed, was something special. The\r\nwalls loomed high above his head, shutting out the light of the morning\r\nsun as he walked down the street canyons where the vegetation had not\r\nyet penetrated. The ghels padded on ahead of him.\r\n\r\nThere was a musty smell about the place. Most appropriate. And the old\r\ntimers had quite a flair for architecture, he thought. The masonry was\r\na kind of cemented substance that was nearly as hard as granite. The\r\nweather had eroded it into a lovely, pearly grayness that was satiny\r\nsmooth to the touch. He stroked the walls lovingly, and wished that he\r\ncould transport the whole place back to Earth.\r\n\r\nAt the end of one street a bright yellow kral snake struck at him and\r\nhe killed it with the butt of his rifle. They encountered no other\r\nlife. Everywhere there was silence.\r\n\r\nThe ghels made several turns through narrow passageways, and all at\r\nonce Seeling was face to face with the most breathtaking sight he had\r\never beheld.\r\n\r\nIn a great, hidden courtyard the palace lay. It was at least six\r\nhundred feet high, from massive base to delicate multiple pinnacles\r\nthat festooned the arched roof. The facade was inscribed with countless\r\nlacy designs, set into the mother masonry with snowy white stones.\r\n\r\nThe great arched doorway gaped open invitingly to the kind of darkness\r\nthat Seeling found most exciting.\r\n\r\nThe ghels stopped. "You are certain that you will not change your mind?"\r\n\r\n"Look here," Seeling said. "I\'ve come here to collect artifacts, or\r\nanything I can lay my hands on for my people on Earth. If I don\'t bring\r\nsomething good back, they\'ll send others who won\'t be as patient with\r\nyou as I am."\r\n\r\n"That is sad, indeed, for the Radiance that made us still lingers in\r\nthe castle," said the ghel.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not going to hurt His Radiant Majesty, whoever he is," Seeling\r\nsaid. "What I want is junk--stuff that you never use anyhow. So let\'s\r\nget on with it."\r\n\r\nGeorge Seeling was panting by the time he had climbed to the top of the\r\ncentral tower. He had always thought of a tomb as some damp, dark hole\r\nbeneath the surface of the ground, for such had been his experience\r\nmany times before. But the resting place of Solon Regh the Wise was a\r\nlarge, light room, not half so eerie as the big throne room below, for\r\ninstance.\r\n\r\nIt took him five minutes to work the mechanism of the outer door. When\r\nhe got it open he went in and found a convenient coffin to sit on,\r\nwiped the sweat from his forehead, and indulged in a cigarette before\r\ncontinuing.\r\n\r\nThe room had no windows, but there was light coming in from the\r\ngreat transparent dome of roof. A cheerful place, he thought, for a\r\ncrypt. There were six coffins in the room, neatly arranged around its\r\nperiphery. He wondered which one was Solon Regh\'s.\r\n\r\nAll of the biers were plain, untarnished metal--a silvery alloy he\r\ncouldn\'t quite identify. Upon one of them there was a modest crest, or\r\nsymbol. That one, he decided, must be the coffin of Solon Regh.\r\n\r\nHe was feeling a little ill. A headache from the altitude, he thought.\r\nOr perhaps he\'d caught a touch of the fever. Better to get it over with\r\nand get out of here. All the pleasure of discovery was gone now.\r\n\r\nHe took out his array of chisels and went to work on the coffin, which\r\nyielded easily to his professional looter\'s touch. The lid was light\r\nand slid aside soundlessly.\r\n\r\nGeorge Seeling came face to face with Solon Regh. The relics of\r\nRegh the Wise seemed to be in perfect condition. Over all lay a\r\nsemi-transparent coating of a waxy substance--the preservative, he\r\nsupposed. The figure was as large as his own. The old race must have\r\nbeen much closer, genetically, to his own than the ghels.\r\n\r\nBut Seeling was not concerned with any of this. He flopped Solon\r\nRegh over on his belly without ceremony and examined the bottom of\r\nthe coffin. It was no use. No treasure here. He did find something,\r\nhowever. The ring on Solon Regh\'s finger. He chipped off the\r\npreservative, slid the ring off and put it in his pocket. Then he\r\nexamined the other coffins. Wives, perhaps, and dignitaries of court,\r\nthese had been. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
There were both male and female. But no jewelry.\r\n\r\nHe searched the room carefully, but there was nothing to be found.\r\nIt had not been their custom, then, to bury their treasures with\r\nthe dead--or perhaps the ghels had taken it. No matter, he knew the\r\nfutility of looking further.\r\n\r\nWhen a race chose to hide its treasures, rather than try to take them\r\nalong to the happy hunting grounds, they usually did a good job. He\r\nremembered searching in vain for a solid year in the catacombs of\r\nNeptune once.\r\n\r\nHis face was burning with some inner fire now; he knew that he must\r\nhave a high fever. He felt much worse. But to go back empty handed!\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly he knew that he would not.\r\n\r\nHe took the steps back down to the throne room three at a time, for he\r\nfelt, strangely, that he must hurry. The ghels were still waiting for\r\nhim there in the gloom. There seemed to be more of them now, but he\r\ndidn\'t bother to count.\r\n\r\n"I want eight of you," he said. "You are to come with me up to the\r\ncrypts. I\'m taking the coffin of Solon Regh back with me, and you are\r\ngoing to carry it. I don\'t want any arguments. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
I\'ll pay you whatever\r\nyou want, but it\'s got to be done right away."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey were not a strong race, the ghels, and the box was without\r\nhandles, but they finally got it to their shoulders. Twice coming down\r\nthe spiraling staircases they slipped, and he cursed them furiously,\r\nthen was amazed that he could be so distraught.\r\n\r\nThey carried it down to the throneroom and set it down. The big rotunda\r\nwas full of ghels by this time; hundreds of them.\r\n\r\n"What the hell is this?" George Seeling said, and his voice sounded\r\nthick to him. "If you\'re going to start trouble--I\'ll kill the first\r\nghel that lays a hand on me or the coffin."\r\n\r\nHe waited for an answer. There was not a sound among the dark multitude\r\nof ghels. They watched him, sorrowfully.\r\n\r\n"Well?" Seeling bellowed.\r\n\r\nThe ghel who had talked with him before said, "We are gathered here for\r\na telling. Will you crouch there and hear us?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what you\'re talking about!"\r\n\r\n"Please hear us.

=== Chunk 7 ===
"\r\n\r\nSeeling looked around him. Better not to antagonize them at that, he\r\nsupposed, since it seemed that they had no intentions, at present, of\r\ndoing anything drastic.\r\n\r\nHe waited.\r\n\r\n"Long ago," the ghel said, "there were the old ones. They were as gods,\r\nand knew great magic. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
All was happiness. But the magic was not great\r\nenough, for one day there came invaders from beyond the stars, and\r\nsprayed the cities with green fire that was so light that its touch\r\ncould not be felt, and yet it killed in great numbers--and the rest it\r\nchanged.\r\n\r\n"Solon Regh, who was wise, took his family about him and hid in the\r\ntower behind air-tight doors where the green fire could not come. Many\r\nweeks he stayed there, with an air purifier to keep out the radiance,\r\nand let in fresh air, and at last the enemy left. The ones who were\r\nleft had changed more and more, so that even in their heads they were\r\naffected, and could scarcely take care of themselves.\r\n\r\n"Solon Regh, from behind his steel door, where the pure air was,\r\nsorrowed for us, and counseled us to pick up our lives as best we\r\ncould. He did not dare come out because the radiance did not leave, but\r\nhung about the palace. We did not care any more. We knew the radiance\r\nwould always be there, but it could not hurt us now. Solon Regh and\r\nhis family did all they could for us, and remembered all the wonderful\r\nknowledge that we had forgotten. They tried to teach us, but we had\r\nforgotten how to learn, too."\r\n\r\n"We? We?" George Seeling screamed. "What are you talking about?"\r\n\r\n"We ghels. Do you not understand? _We_ were the old ones."\r\n\r\n"Oh, God!" George said.\r\n\r\n"The Radiance is still in the buildings. That is what we tried to tell\r\nyou before. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
But it is too late now. It has touched you."\r\n\r\n"Let me out of here!" Seeling sobbed. "I won\'t be changed by any damned\r\nradiation. I\'ll go back to Earth. They\'ll help me. They\'ll know what to\r\ndo. He-help me, dammit!"\r\n\r\n"You will not go back," the ghel said. "I am sorry, but you really\r\ncannot go back like this; you will be more at home here from now on."\r\n\r\nAll the ghels looked at George Seeling with sad, limpid stares. They\r\nwere silent. There wasn\'t any more to be said. Nothing that they could\r\nthink of.\r\n\r\nAnd George Seeling, squatting there, gazed back at them with big,\r\nsaucer eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
