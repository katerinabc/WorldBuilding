]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of man becomes fearfully and wonderfully confusing with\r\nthe advent of interstellar travel. Of special interest to the legally\r\ninclined student is the famous Skrrgck Affair, which began before the\r\nGalactic Tribunal with the case of _Citizens vs. Skrrgck_.\r\n\r\nThe case, and the opinion of the Court, may be summarized as follows:\r\n\r\nSkrrgck, a native of Sknnbt (Altair IV), where theft is honorable,\r\nsanctioned by law and custom, immigrated to Earth (Sol III) where\r\ntheft is contrary to both law and custom.\r\n\r\nWhile residing in Chicago, a city in a political subdivision known as\r\nthe State of Illinois, part of the United States of America, one of\r\nthe ancient nation-states of Earth, he overheard his landlady use the\r\nphrase "A license to steal," a common colloquialism in the area, which\r\nrefers to any special privilege.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1: Actual scene of license issue (Skrrgck\r\nsuperimposed)]\r\n\r\nSkrrgck then went to a police station in Chicago and requested a\r\nlicense to steal. The desk sergeant, as a joke, wrote out a document\r\npurporting to be a license to steal, and Skrrgck, relying on said\r\ndocument, committed theft, was apprehended, tried and convicted. On\r\ndirect appeal allowed to the Galactic Tribunal, the Court held:\r\n\r\n(1) All persons are required to know and obey the law of the\r\njurisdiction in which they reside.\r\n\r\n(2) Public officials must refrain from misrepresenting to strangers the\r\nlaw of the jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n(3) Where, as here, a public official is guilty of such\r\nmisrepresentation, the requirement of knowledge no longer applies.\r\n\r\n(4) Where, as here, it is shown by uncontradicted evidence that a\r\ndefendant is law-abiding and willing to comply with the standards of\r\nhis place of residence, misrepresentation of law by public officials\r\nmay amount to entrapment.\r\n\r\n(5) The Doctrine of Entrapment bars the State of Illinois from\r\nprosecuting this defendant.\r\n\r\n(6) The magnitude of the crime is unimportant compared with the\r\nprinciple involved, and the fact that the defendant\'s unusual training\r\non Sknnbt enabled him to steal a large building in Chicago, known as\r\nthe Merchandise Mart, is of no significance.\r\n\r\n(7) The defendant, however, was civilly liable for the return of the\r\nbuilding, and its occupants, or their value, even if he had to steal\r\nto get it, provided, however, that he stole only on and from a planet\r\nwhere theft was legal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2: The moment of decision, case of _Citizens vs.\r\nSkrrgck_]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Skrrgck case was by no means concluded by the decision of the\r\nGalactic Tribunal, but continued to reverberate down the years, a field\r\nday for lawyers, and "a lesson to all in the complexities of modern\r\nintergalactic law and society," said Winston, Harold C, Herman Prof, of\r\nLegal History, Harvard.\r\n\r\nThough freed on the criminal charge of theft, Skrrgck still faced some\r\n20,000 charges of kidnapping, plus the civil liability imposed upon him\r\nby the ruling of the Court.\r\n\r\nThe kidnapping charges were temporarily held in abeyance. Not that the\r\nabductions were not considered outrageous, but it was quickly realized\r\nby all concerned that if Skrrgck were constantly involved in lengthy\r\nand expensive defenses to criminal prosecutions, there would be no\r\nchance at all of obtaining any restitution from him. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
First things\r\nfirst, and with Terrans that rarely means justice.\r\n\r\nSkrrgck offered to pay over the money he had received for the building\r\nand its occupants, but that was unacceptable to the Terrans, for what\r\nthey really wanted, with that exaggerated fervor typical of them,\r\nprovided it agrees with their financial interests, was the return of\r\nthe original articles. Not only were the people wanted back, but the\r\nbuilding itself had a special significance.\r\n\r\nIts full title was "The New Merchandise Mart" and it had been built\r\nin the exact style of the original and on the exact spot on the south\r\nside of the Chicago River where the original had stood prior to its\r\ndestruction in the Sack of Chicago. It was more than just a large\r\ncommercial structure to the Terrans. It was also a symbol of Terra\'s\r\nunusually quick recovery from its Empire Chaos into its present\r\nposition of leadership within the Galactic Union. The Terrans wanted\r\nthat building back.\r\n\r\nSo Skrrgck, an obliging fellow at heart, tried first to get it back,\r\nbut this proved impossible, for he had sold the building to the\r\nAldebaranian Confederacy for use in its annual "prosperity fiesta."\r\n\r\nThe dominant culture of the Aldebaranian system is a descendant of the\r\n"conspicuous destruction" or "potlatch" type, in which articles of\r\nvalue are destroyed to prove the wealth and power of the destroyers.\r\nIt was customary once every Aldebaranian year--about six Terran--for\r\nthe Aldebaranian government to sponsor a token celebration of this\r\ndestructive sort, and it had purchased the Merchandise Mart from\r\nSkrrgck as part of its special celebration marking the first thousand\r\nyears of the Confederacy.\r\n\r\nConsequently, the building, along with everything else, was totally\r\ndestroyed in the "bonfire" that consumed the entire fourth planet from\r\nthe main Aldebaranian sun.\r\n\r\nNor was Skrrgck able to arrange the return to Terra of the occupants of\r\nthe building, some 20,000 in number, because he had sold them as slaves\r\nto the Bo\xc3\xb6tean League.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is commonly thought slavery is forbidden throughout the Galaxy by\r\nthe terms of Article 19 of the Galactic Compact, but such is not the\r\ncase. What is actually forbidden is "involuntary servitude" and this\r\nsituation proved the significance of that distinction. In the case of\r\n_Sol v. Bo\xc3\xb6tes_, the Galactic Tribunal held that Terra had no right to\r\nforce the "slaves" to give up their slavery and return to Terra if they\r\ndid not wish to. And, quite naturally, none of them wished to.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that the Bo\xc3\xb6teans, a singularly handsome and\r\ngood-natured people, were in imminent danger of racial extinction due\r\nto the disastrous effects of a strange nucleonic storm which had passed\r\nthrough their system in 1622. The physiological details of the "Bo\xc3\xb6tean\r\nEffect," as it has been called, was to render every Bo\xc3\xb6tean sterile in\r\nrelation to every other Bo\xc3\xb6tean, while leaving each Bo\xc3\xb6tean normally\r\ncapable of reproduction, provided one of the partners in the union had\r\nnot been subjected to the nucleonic storm.\r\n\r\nFaced with this situation, the Bo\xc3\xb6teans immediately took steps to\r\nencourage widespread immigration by other humanoid races, chiefly\r\nTerrans, for it was Terrans who had originally colonized Bo\xc3\xb6tes and it\r\nwas therefore known that interbreeding was possible.\r\n\r\nBut the Bo\xc3\xb6teans were largely unsuccessful in their immigration\r\npolicy. Terra was peaceful and prosperous, and the Bo\xc3\xb6teans, being\r\npoor advertisers, were unable to convince more than a handful to leave\r\nthe relative comforts of home for the far-off Bo\xc3\xb6tean system where,\r\nalmost all were sure, some horrible fate lay behind the Bo\xc3\xb6teans\'\r\nhoneyed words. So when Skrrgck showed up with some 20,000 Terrans,\r\nthe Bo\xc3\xb6teans, in desperation, agreed to purchase them in the hope of\r\navoiding the "involuntary servitude" prohibition of Article 19 by\r\nmaking them like it.\r\n\r\nIn this, they were spectacularly successful. The "slaves" were\r\ntreated to the utmost luxury and every effort was made to satisfy any\r\nreasonable wish. Their "duties" consisted entirely of "keeping company"\r\nwith the singularly attractive Bo\xc3\xb6teans.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances it is, perhaps, hardly surprising that out of\r\nthe 20,101 occupants, all but 332 flatly refused to return to Terra.\r\n\r\nThe 332 who did wish to return, most of whom were borderline\r\npsychotics, were shipped home, and Bo\xc3\xb6tes sued Skrrgck for their\r\npurchase price, but was turned down by the Galactic Quadrant Court on\r\nthe theory of, basically, Caveat Emptor--let the buyer beware.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Court in _Sol v. Bo\xc3\xb6tes_ had held that although adults could not be\r\nrequired to return to Terra, minors under the age of 31 could be, and\r\nan additional 569 were returned under this ruling, to the vociferous\r\ndisgust of the post-puberty members of that group. Since there was\r\napparently some question of certain misrepresentations by Skrrgck\r\nas to the ages or family affiliations of some members of this minor\r\ngroup, he agreed to an out-of-court settlement of Bo\xc3\xb6tes\' claim for\r\ntheir purchase price, thus depriving the legal profession of further\r\nclarification of the rights of two "good faith" dealers in this\r\npeculiar sort of transaction.\r\n\r\nThe Terran people, of course, were totally unsatisfied with this\r\nresult. Led by some demagogues and, to a milder degree, by most of the\r\npolitical opposition to the existing Terran government, and reminded of\r\ncertain actual examples from Terra\'s own history, many became convinced\r\nthat some form of nefarious "brainwashing" had been exercised upon the\r\n"unfortunate" Terran expatriates. Excitement ran high, and there was\r\neven some agitation for withdrawal from the Galactic Union.\r\n\r\nConfronted with such unrest, the Terran government made efforts to\r\nreach some settlement with Bo\xc3\xb6tes despite the decision of the Court\r\nin _Sol v. Bo\xc3\xb6tes_, and was finally able to gain in the Centaurian\r\nAgreement a substantial reparation, it being specifically stipulated\r\nin the Agreement that the money was to be paid to the dependents who\r\nsuffered actual financial loss.\r\n\r\nIn a suit against the Terran government by one of the excluded\r\nfamilies, to obtain for that family a share of the reparation, the\r\nvalidity of the treaty, as it applied to exclude the suing family and\r\nothers in like position, was upheld by the United States Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nThe suit was begun before the Agreement had been ratified by the\r\nGeneral Assembly, and the Court indicated that the plaintiff would\r\nhave lost on the strength of a long line of cases giving the World\r\nPresident certain inherent powers over the conduct of foreign affairs.\r\nSince, however, the matter came up for decision after ratification,\r\nthe Court said that the "inherent powers" question was moot, and that\r\nthe Agreement, having been elevated to the status of a treaty by\r\nratification, must be held valid under the "Supremacy of Treaties"\r\nsection of Article 102 of the United Terran Charter.\r\n\r\nAlthough this failed to satisfy the Terran people--and their anger may\r\nhave contributed to the fall of the Solarian Party administration in\r\nthe following election--the Treaty is generally considered by students\r\nof the subject as a triumph of Solarian diplomacy, and an outstanding\r\nexample of intergalactic good faith on the part of Bo\xc3\xb6tes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf course, neither the demagogy nor the anger could hide forever the\r\ntrue facts about how the Bo\xc3\xb6teans were treating their "slaves," and\r\nwhen the true facts became known, there was a sudden flood of migration\r\nfrom Terra to Bo\xc3\xb6tes, which threatened to depopulate the Solarian\r\nEmpire and drown Bo\xc3\xb6tes. The flood was quickly dammed by the Treaty\r\nof Deneb restricting migration between the two systems. This treaty\r\nwas held to be a valid police-powers exception to the "Free Migration"\r\nprinciple of Article 17 of the Galactic Compact in _Boleslaw v. Sol and\r\nBo\xc3\xb6tes_.\r\n\r\nAll this left Skrrgck with liabilities of some forty million credits\r\nand practically no assets. Like most Altairians, he was a superb thief\r\nbut a poor trader. The price he had received for the Merchandise Mart\r\nand the "slaves," while amounting to a tidy personal fortune, was\r\nless than half the amount of the claims against him, and due to an\r\nunfortunate predilection for slow _Aedrils_ and fast _Flowezies_, he\r\nonly had about half of that left.\r\n\r\nSkrrgck, who had by this time apparently developed a love of litigation\r\nequal to his love of thievery, used part of what he did have left in a\r\nlast effort to evade liability by going into bankruptcy, a move which\r\nwas naturally met with howls of outrage by his creditors and a flood\r\nof objections to his petition, a flood which very nearly drowned the\r\nFederal District Court in Chicago.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to imagine a more complex legal battle than might\r\nhave taken place, nor one more instructive to the legal profession, had\r\nthe situation been carried to its logical conclusion.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand was the age-old policy of both Terran and Galactic\r\nbankruptcy law. A man becomes unable to pay his debts. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
He goes into\r\nbankruptcy. Whatever he does have is distributed to his creditors, who\r\nmust be satisfied with what they can get out of his present assets.\r\nThey cannot require him to go to work to earn additional funds with\r\nwhich to pay them more. It is precisely to escape this form of mortgage\r\non one\'s future that bankruptcy exists.\r\n\r\nYet here were over seven thousand creditors claiming that Skrrgck\'s\r\ndebts should not be discharged in bankruptcy, because Skrrgck could be\r\nrequired to steal enough to satisfy them fully.\r\n\r\nCould the creditors require Skrrgck to exert such personal efforts to\r\nsatisfy their claims? A lawyer would almost certainly say "no," citing\r\nthe Bankruptcy Act as sufficient grounds alone, not to mention the\r\nanomaly of having Terrans, in a Terran court, ask that Skrrgck, for\r\ntheir benefit, commit an act illegal on Terra and punishable by that\r\nTerran court.\r\n\r\nThe idea of a Terran court giving judicial sanction to theft is novel,\r\nto say the least. Indeed, Judge Griffin, who was presiding, was\r\noverheard to remark to a friend on the golf course that he "would throw\r\nthe whole d--n thing out" for that reason alone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYet, in spite of this undeniable weight of opinion, it is difficult to\r\nsay just what the final decision would have been had the matter been\r\ncarried to the Galactic Tribunal, for in the original case of _Skrrgck\r\nv. Illinois_, that august body, it will be remembered, had specifically\r\nstated that Skrrgck was liable for the value of the building and its\r\noccupants, "even if he must steal to obtain it."\r\n\r\nNow that hasty and ill-advised phrase was certainly dicta, and was\r\nprobably intended only as a joke, the opinion having been written by\r\nMaster Adjudicator Stsssts, a member of that irrepressible race of\r\nsaurian humorists, the Sirians. But if the case had actually come\r\nbefore them, the Court might have been hoist on its own petard, so to\r\nspeak, and been forced to rule in accord with its earlier "joke."\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for the curiosity of the legal profession, the question\r\nwas never to be answered, for Skrrgck did a remarkable thing which\r\nmade the whole controversy irrelevant. What his motives were will\r\nprobably never be known. His character makes it unlikely that he began\r\nthe bankruptcy proceedings in good faith and was later moved by\r\nconscience. It is possible that the bankruptcy was merely an elaborate\r\npiece of misdirection. More probably, however, he simply seized on the\r\nunusual opportunity the publicity gave him.\r\n\r\nWhatever the motives, the facts are that Skrrgck used the last of\r\nhis waning resources to purchase one of the newly developed Terran\r\nMotors\' "Timebirds" in which he traveled secretly to Altair. Even\r\nthis first model of the Timebird, with its primitive meson exchange\r\ndiscoordinator, cut the trip from Sol to Altair from weeks to days,\r\nand Skrrgck, landing secretly on his home planet while his bankruptcy\r\naction was still in the turmoil stage, was able to accomplish the\r\ngreatest "coup" in Altairian history. He never could have done it\r\nwithout the publicity of the legal proceedings. In a culture where\r\ntheft is honorable, the most stringent precautions are taken against\r\nits accomplishment, but who could have expected Skrrgck? He was\r\nlight-years away, trying to go into bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nAnd so, while all eyes on Altair, as well as throughout the rest of the\r\nGalaxy, were amusedly fixed on the legal circus shaping up on Terra,\r\nSkrrgck was able to steal the Altairian Crown Jewels, and the Altairian\r\nCrown Prince as well, and flee with them to Sol.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe reaction was violent. The Galaxy was gripped by an almost\r\nhysterical amusement. Skrrgck\'s creditors on Terra were overjoyed. The\r\nAltairians made one effort to regain their valuables in the courts, but\r\nwere promptly turned down by the Galactic Tribunal which held, wisely,\r\nthat a society which made a virtue of theft would have to take the\r\nconsequences of its own culture.\r\n\r\nSo Skrrgck\'s creditors were paid in full. The jewels alone were more\r\nthan sufficient for that, containing as they did no less than seven\r\npriceless "Wanderstones," those strange bits of frozen fire found ever\r\nso rarely floating in the interstellar voids, utterly impervious to\r\nany of the effects of gravitation. Altair paid a fantastic price for\r\nthe return of the collection, and Skrrgck also demanded, and got, a\r\nsizable ransom for the Prince, after threatening to sell him to Bo\xc3\xb6tes,\r\nfrom whence, of course, he would never return. Being a prince in a\r\ndemocratic, constitutional monarchy is not as glamorous as you might\r\nthink.\r\n\r\nHis creditors satisfied, Skrrgck returned to Sknnbt, dragging with\r\nhim an angry Crown Prince--angry at having lost the chance to go to\r\nBo\xc3\xb6tes, that is. At Altair, Skrrgck was received as a popular hero.\r\nHe had accomplished something of which every Altairian had dreamed,\r\nalmost from the moment of his birth, and he was widely and joyously\r\nacclaimed. Riding on this wave of popular adulation, he entered\r\npolitics, ran for the office of Premier, and was elected by an\r\noverwhelming majority.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he took office, he took steps, in accordance with Altairian\r\ncustom, to wipe out the "stain" on his honor incurred by allowing the\r\nChicago police sergeant to fool him with the now famous License to\r\nSteal.\r\n\r\nHe instituted suit against the sergeant for the expenses of his defense\r\nto the original theft charge.\r\n\r\nThe case was carried all the way to the Galactic Tribunal, which by\r\nthis time was heartily sick of the whole mess. Feeling apparently that\r\nthe sergeant was the original cause of said mess, the Court overruled\r\nhis plea that he had merely been joking.\r\n\r\nThe Court cited an ancient case from West Virginia, U.S.A.--_Plate v.\r\nDurst_, 42 W. Va. 63, 24 SE 580, 32 L.R.A. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
404. (Note: The date of this\r\ncase is invariably given as 1896, which is most confusing, since the\r\npresent date is only 1691. The 1896, however, refers to the eighteen\r\nhundred and ninety-sixth year of the pre-atomic era, which we, of\r\ncourse, style A.A.--Ante Atomica. Since the present era begins with the\r\nfirst atomic explosion, the case actually occurred in approximately the\r\nyear 54 A.A.)\r\n\r\nThe Court quoted the opinion in this ancient case as follows: "Jokes\r\nare sometimes taken seriously by ... the inexperienced ... and if such\r\nis the case, and the person thereby deceived is led to (incur expenses)\r\nin the full belief and expectation that the joker is in earnest, the\r\nlaw will also take the joker at his word, and give him good reason to\r\nsmile."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the sergeant was charged with a very large judgment.\r\nAlthough the City of Chicago paid this judgment, the sergeant had\r\nbecome the laughing-stock of the planet, so he applied for, and was\r\ngranted, a hardship exception to the Treaty of Deneb and migrated to\r\nBo\xc3\xb6tes.\r\n\r\nThere, regarded as the real savior of the Bo\xc3\xb6tean race, and a chosen\r\ninstrument of the God of Bo\xc3\xb6tes, he was received as a saint. He died in\r\n1689, surrounded by his 22 children and 47 grandchildren, having made\r\nhimself wealthy by becoming the leader of a most excessive fertility\r\ncult, which is only now being forcibly suppressed by the Bo\xc3\xb6tean\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nIn 1635 P.A., someone on Earth remembered the kidnapping indictments\r\nstill outstanding against Skrrgck and attempted to prosecute them. By\r\nthis time, however, Skrrgck was Premier, the chief executive officer of\r\nAltair, and all extradition matters were within his sole discretion. In\r\nthe exercise of this power, he refused to extradite himself, and the\r\nprosecutor on Earth, whose constituents were beginning to laugh at him,\r\nhad the indictments quashed "in the interest of interstellar harmony."\r\n\r\nThe story has an interesting sequel. During Skrrgck\'s unprecedented six\r\nconsecutive terms as Premier (no one else had ever served less than\r\nseven), he was able, by dint of unremitting political maneuvering,\r\nto have theft outlawed in the Altairian system. It was, he said, "a\r\ncultural trait that is more trouble than it is worth."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
