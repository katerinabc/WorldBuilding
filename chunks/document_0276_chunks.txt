Thanks a lot but--no thanks.\r\nI wasn\'t panhandling, my hat fell off and I was trying to find it on\r\nthe sidewalk. Thanks again for finding it for me but I think I could\r\nhave managed. And, no offense, but I can find my way all right without\r\nbeing led._\r\n\r\n_You\'re surprised that I\'m rather young, huh? Well, youth isn\'t a\r\ncrime and anyways, twenty-four can be either young or old, depending on\r\nwho you\'re talking to. But I know what you mean. I\'m rather young for\r\nbeing blind, isn\'t that it? Most blind people you see on the streets\r\nare the old ones, the shabby ones with the pleading faces and the hat\r\nwith the lead pencils in it or maybe a tin cup and a violin. Sorry to\r\ndisappoint you but I guess I\'m not the type._\r\n\r\n_Sure, I know--you were only trying to help. You probably think I\'m\r\nbitter because I can\'t see your world and all the wonderful things in\r\nit. Well, it\'s a long story but that\'s not the punch line. I might be\r\nbitter but not for the reasons you might think. Up until two weeks\r\nago I could see as well as you. And you couldn\'t call what happened\r\n"losing" my sight. Not exactly._\r\n\r\n_So you\'re curious.

You want to hear the rest of it. And you\'re sure\r\nit\'s not just out of sympathy. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Well, all right. There\'s a bar in the\r\nnext block where we can get a booth and a couple of beers._\r\n\r\n_Now look, I don\'t need to be led! You don\'t need eyes to find your\r\nway to a bar on a hot summer day like this. It\'s toward the end of the\r\nblock, just a few steps further.... Right here. There\'s a booth in the\r\nback where nobody will bother us for a while._\r\n\r\n_Okay, make mine the same and here\'s half a dollar to pay for them.\r\nDon\'t worry, I\'ve got money enough to keep me in beer and pretzels for\r\na long time. Nobody could accuse the professor of being stingy with the\r\nuniversity funds when he paid me off._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt began about six months ago. I was in my third year at college,\r\nstudying physics under Professor Martin. Maybe you\'ve seen Martin\r\naround the campus--a rather thin guy with a face like the Rock of\r\nGibraltar. One of the few profs who can still sound enthusiastic about\r\ntheir subject after twenty years of teaching it.\r\n\r\nThe unit we were studying at the time was the one on light and physical\r\noptics, primarily a study of the spectrum stretching from x-rays beyond\r\nthe ultra-violet to the visible spectrum, down to the infra-red and\r\nradio waves and the short waves used in television and radar. I had\r\nbeen absent from class a week and on my return the professor invited me\r\nto dinner. After the dishes had been cleared away he leaned back in his\r\nchair and lit what I took to be his usual after dinner cigar.\r\n\r\n"I like to meet my students informally, Charles," he began. "Sorry that\r\nyour wife couldn\'t come but I understand she\'s ... well...." He let the\r\nsentence trail off.\r\n\r\nI sat there feeling rather sick. It\'s one of those things you hope\r\neverybody has heard about so you don\'t have to explain, to sit and\r\ntake their looks of pity and sympathy. Apparently the professor hadn\'t\r\nheard. "I\'m sorry," I said. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
"I thought you knew. Both Alice and the\r\nbaby died."\r\n\r\nThe hand he held his cigar in quivered a little. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
"I\'m sorry," he said,\r\nand mercifully dropped it there. Then he changed the subject to the one\r\nhe had in mind when he had asked me to dinner.\r\n\r\n"Light, Charles, is such a large subject--and, comparatively speaking,\r\nso little is known about it. But perhaps--perhaps I know more than\r\nmost. And if you wish, you can too. Would you like to see the world you\r\nlive in, Charles? Not just the one tenth of one percent that they call\r\nthe visible spectrum, but all of it, the whole glorious universe of\r\nlight?"\r\n\r\nHe took me into his confidence on his favorite research project, an\r\nattempt to see wavelengths other than those in the visible spectrum.\r\nHis enthusiasm was catching and there wasn\'t much hesitation. I signed\r\nthe paper releasing the university from all responsibility in case\r\nof an "accident." So easy to sign one\'s life away--though it wasn\'t\r\nactually my life, only my eyesight.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe treatments began immediately. First, adaptation of vision to a\r\ndark room, like those used for flyers during the war. Then the drops\r\nof black liquid that the professor had invented, slowly spreading over\r\nthe eyes, subtly altering the rods and cones of the retina, the nerve\r\nendings sensitive to light.\r\n\r\nAnd I began to live in a gradually fading world. Have you ever wondered\r\nwhat it\'s like to go blind? The increasing dusk and darkness around the\r\nedges of your vision, the little errors and mistakes that begin to crop\r\nup in everyday life. Your blunder over a stool that you didn\'t quite\r\nsee, your snubbing someone on the street whom you didn\'t recognize in\r\ntime, the gradual awareness among your friends that something was\r\nwrong with your eyes and their crude attempts to make it "easier" for\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nFor to all intents and purposes I was going blind. My "range" of vision\r\nremained the same but it was shifting down the scale. The first colors\r\nto fade out of my vision were violet and blue and their tints. The sky\r\noverhead gradually became colorless, magazine covers began to lose\r\ntheir appeal and slip into a bleak blending of yellows and reds. Then\r\nslowly, the other colors began to grow dim and less distinct until\r\nfinally even red had faded from my sight.\r\n\r\nBut there were other colors that replaced them. Brilliant,\r\nscintillating colors that made seeing an adventure.\r\n\r\nDescribe them to you? How could you describe "red" and "green" to a\r\nperson who was blind from birth? How can I describe iridescent and\r\nvliosheen to you? Do you think you could understand? Do you think you\r\ncould "see" what I mean?\r\n\r\nOh, I could still get around in your world. I could still "see" people.\r\nAll objects radiate heat, even ice. As an object\'s temperature goes up,\r\nthe wavelength of the radiation given off goes up to the infra-red,\r\nthen into the visible. I could tell how hot water was by looking at it.\r\nI could see people by the heat they gave off, glowing figures moving\r\ndown the street and around the lab!\r\n\r\nAnd still my range of vision shifted. Down to short waves and radio\r\nwaves, the language of international communication, the wavelengths\r\nthat continents and countries speak to each other in. Do you know how\r\nbeautiful the aerial of your radio is, the different waves running down\r\nit like ripples across a pond? Have you ever seen the glorious pool\r\nof light around a radio broadcasting station? Have you ever marveled\r\nat the thin, trailing filaments of color tangling in the nest of\r\ntelevision antennas that the city carries on its rooftops?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe professor was worried, for along with losing my sight of this\r\nworld, I began to lose interest in it. A truly blind man wouldn\'t\r\nfor he has nothing to replace vision with, he\'s still bound to the\r\ncommonplace globe. He can improve his hearing or his sense of touch,\r\nbut nothing replaces his sight. It was different with me. I was seeing\r\nsomething far more interesting than the dull, mundane world.\r\n\r\nThey fixed a cot up for me in the laboratory; an experiment like myself\r\nwas far too important to risk on the streets. Even then, I\'d bump into\r\ntables or smash lab apparatus. I suppose an important experiment like I\r\nwas should have taken care of itself, sort of like a self-lubricating\r\nmotor. I\'d cost the university lots of money and I suppose I should\r\nhave watched out for their investment--though I was probably the only\r\none who _didn\'t_ care what happened to me.\r\n\r\nThere finally came a day when my eyes didn\'t change. I had reached a\r\nsticking point. The end of the spectrum? The professor said he didn\'t\r\nthink so.\r\n\r\nI didn\'t think so either for just beyond my range of vision seemed a\r\nhint of something else. I caught "glimpses" of something--I couldn\'t\r\nmake out exactly what. There seemed to be vague suggestions of form\r\nand color and life, indistinct figures that capered and grimaced just\r\nbeyond my view. There was nothing definite, nothing that I could draw\r\na picture of and describe like you could an automobile or a building.\r\nThere were just suggestions, a feeling of something more. There was a\r\nhint of life in the masses of winking light that beckoned and burned.\r\n\r\nThe next day the professor brought my eyes back to normal. Familiar\r\nobjects had a sudden fascination that quickly faded when I had regained\r\nnormal vision for an hour or so. It was a prosaic world once again.\r\nRadios and aerials were just--cabinets of wood and plastic and glass\r\ntubes and strips of rusty wire and metal.\r\n\r\nI wasn\'t sure the experiment was over. I asked the professor if there\r\nwas anything that would take me further along the scale, beyond,\r\nperhaps, even the spectrum as we knew it.\r\n\r\nHe twisted his hands nervously behind his back and walked over and\r\nlooked out the laboratory window. "I could do it for you, Charles, but\r\nI\'m not sure that I could bring you back. Your eyes would be stranded\r\nin that world of yours. You could never look at ours again."\r\n\r\nHe turned from the window and faced me.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you forget it for a few weeks and then come back here and if\r\nyou still want to, we\'ll continue the experiment."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI agreed and left. I spent the next two weeks doing nothing but looking\r\nat our world. Do you think you really appreciate your sight? If you\r\nknew you had but a few weeks of sight left, what would you do with it?\r\nVisit famous landmarks? See the country? If you thought about it, I\r\nthink you\'d do the same as I did. I began to enjoy what was close at\r\nhand, the surroundings I had lived in. Everyday sights held a certain\r\nfascination for me. The stark black and white mosaic of a city at the\r\ntag end of winter; the sheer, raucous color of the magazines at your\r\nlocal newsstand; the smooth patterns of hues and tints in a department\r\nstore window display.\r\n\r\nAnd how much do you appreciate springtime? The few weeks of the year\r\nwhen the city loses its look of drabness and little plots of grass and\r\nflowers add color to it--like brilliant strips of cloth in a dirty\r\npatchwork quilt. Then there were the kids roller skating down the\r\nsidewalks, the girls\' pigtails flying and the boys\' knickers flapping\r\nin the breeze. And later on, in the business blocks, the soft glow of\r\nneon against the swirling fog of a warm spring night.\r\n\r\nThat was the last spring I\'ll ever see. I\'ll be able to smell the\r\nflowers and feel the warmth of the sun and run my fingers through the\r\ngreen grass. But I\'ll never see it again.\r\n\r\nAfter the few weeks were up I returned to the professor--still curious\r\nabout what lay beyond the spectrum limits. There were the eye washes\r\nand the drops and then the heavy strips of white cloth wrapped around\r\nmy head, keeping your world out and bounding mine with a rim of black.\r\nMy last look at the world was of some kids playing in the city streets,\r\nand some bread crumbs spread out on the window sill for the birds.\r\nAfter that a quick view of the lab--a jungle of glass retorts and vats\r\nfilled with oily chemicals--and a closeup of Professor Martin\'s gnarled\r\nhands holding the bandages for my eyes.\r\n\r\nI lay on the cot in the lab for the next few days, listening to your\r\nworld and feeling it and remembering it; the good and the bad, the\r\nadventuresome and the dull. I could hear the newsboy hawking his papers\r\nand the shouts of the kids and the clatter of the main street trolley.\r\nI could smell the factory smoke and the heavy, animal odor drifting up\r\nfrom the stockyards. I could hear the people in the lab and Professor\r\nMartin scurrying about, asking me how I felt, and toward the end,\r\ntelling me that in a few hours the bandages would come off.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks ago the professor came into the lab and started tearing at\r\nthe adhesive, stripping away the layers of white cloth. Even when he\r\nhad the bandages all the way off, I kept my eyes closed, almost afraid\r\nto open them.\r\n\r\nMy eyes had to focus first. Everything was so damned brilliant and\r\nindistinct. Then my sight cleared and suddenly everything was very\r\nplain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Well, that\'s about it. There isn\'t much more to tell. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
It hasn\'t been\r\ntoo boring to listen to me for fifteen minutes, has it? I can tell you\r\nhaven\'t been too bored because you haven\'t touched your beer, have you?\r\nIt\'s getting warm--and you know what they say about warm beer...._\r\n\r\n_What did I see? You really want to know, don\'t you?_\r\n\r\n_Well, I\'ve tried to rationalize it and explain it and I suppose I\r\ncan, in a dim way. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Put it this way: I\'m totally blind now. What\'s\r\nbright to you is black to me. But I\'m not bitter because I can\'t see_\r\nyour _world. And I can\'t describe to you what I saw because, you see, I\r\ndon\'t remember. Perhaps it\'s merciful, I don\'t know. I can only guess\r\nfrom what the professor told me._\r\n\r\n_Professor Martin had stripped the bandages from my eyes and he and a\r\nfew assistants saw my eyes blur and finally focus on something in a\r\ndifferent world from theirs. And then, before I fainted, I screamed the\r\none word that none of them would ever forget._\r\n\r\n"_ALICE!_"\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
