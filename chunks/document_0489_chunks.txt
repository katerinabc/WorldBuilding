"And\r\n_Win-a-Mint_ always keeps its promises, don\'t we? So, folks, tonight\r\nwe\'re putting up the biggest mint offered yet on this program ... _one\r\nhundred thousand dollars_!"\r\n\r\nThe applause was deafening.\r\n\r\n"Now, then, here\'s the young man you all remember, the boy who hit the\r\ntop money on our little group quiz last week, and earned the right to\r\n_Win-a-Mint_! Here he is, Mr. Don Gerson! Come on out, Don!"\r\n\r\nDon Gerson was a tall, thin young man with a serious look. He did not\r\nwear glasses, but somehow he looked as if he ought to. He walked onto\r\nthe stage with a kind of forced confidence and shook hands with Lonigan.\r\n\r\n"Now, then, Don, we haven\'t told you very much about what we\'re going\r\nto do for you, have we?" Lonigan asked.\r\n\r\n"No, sir."\r\n\r\n"So I think it\'ll be as big a surprise to you as it will to our\r\naudience." Lonigan laughed, and looked archly into the cameras. "But\r\nfirst, we\'ll have to introduce you all over again, for anybody who\r\ndidn\'t see the fine show you put up for us last week. How old are you,\r\nDon?"\r\n\r\n"Twenty-eight."\r\n\r\n"And you\'re not married, are you? Engaged? Do you trust your girl\r\nfriend not to go out with other fellows if you aren\'t handy?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know ..." Gerson grinned shyly.\r\n\r\n"Did you tell her you\'d be going away for a little while?" Lonigan\r\nasked, winking at the cameras.\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I\'ve been told," Gerson said.\r\n\r\n"Uh huh. But we didn\'t tell you anything else, did we? Did your boss\r\ngive you a leave of absence?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes."\r\n\r\n"Tell us, Don, what do you do for a living?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m an accountant."\r\n\r\nLonigan\'s grin grew wider. "Yes, folks, Don works for the great\r\nNational American Insurance Company, of which you\'ve all heard. We\r\nasked them to let us borrow Don here for two months, and they\'ve been\r\nkind enough to agree. Now, working in insurance, Don, I guess you\'ve\r\ngotten pretty good at logical predictions, eh? I mean, isn\'t it part of\r\nthe insurance business to guess what\'s likely to happen?"\r\n\r\n"I\'d say it was." Don Gerson was looking mildly puzzled.\r\n\r\n"Well, Don, we\'ve set up a situation where you\'ll get a chance to guess\r\nwhat\'s happening next, and if you guess right, even halfway, you\'ll\r\n_Win-a-Mint_!" Lonigan boomed the last words impressively, and the\r\norchestra blasted the theme chords into his words.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s what we\'re going to do, Don," Lonigan went on. "You\'re going to\r\ngo down to the airport, where we\'ve got a special helicopter waiting.\r\nOur copter will take you to the island of Santa Antonia, two hundred\r\nmiles off the coast. It\'s a lovely island, Don ... you\'ll really like\r\nit. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
There\'s a comfortable little house there, and we\'ve had the place\r\nall stocked up for you. There\'s even a nice big deep-freeze from the\r\nHandi-Freezo people, filled right up to the top."\r\n\r\nLonigan paused, to get the effect.\r\n\r\n"Of course," he continued, "There isn\'t anyone else on the island.\r\nNobody at all! And no radio, no newspapers, no way at all to hear from\r\nthe outside world. Yes sir, Don, you\'ll be a real Robinson Crusoe. But\r\njust think, for two months, you\'ll get paid your regular salary; we\'re\r\ntaking care of that. You can read, fish, think, maybe even write a book\r\nif you feel like it. Ever think about writing a book, Don?"\r\n\r\nGerson opened his mouth, but he was apparently too surprised to answer\r\nfor a moment. Then he shook his head.\r\n\r\n"No-o, but maybe, with all that time...."\r\n\r\n"Well, Don, you can certainly read, if you feel like it," Lonigan\r\nwent on. "Because we\'ve put plenty of good, solid books on the island\r\nfor you. There\'s fiction, of course, and textbooks on history, and\r\nencyclopedias.... Now, what do you think you could do with all that\r\ninformation in those books?"\r\n\r\n"Well...."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you what you\'d better do, Don." Lonigan\'s eyes flicked to\r\nthe studio clock, and his voice speeded up imperceptibly. "Read up, Don\r\nboy. Because we\'re going to bring you into this studio two months from\r\nnow, when our program resumes in the fall season. And we\'re going to\r\nask you a dozen questions about things that have been happening in the\r\nmeantime--people, places, and current events. If you can\'t answer at\r\nleast six of those questions right, we\'ll be awfully _sorry_!"\r\n\r\nThe audience roared again.\r\n\r\n"But if you _can_ answer them, just six out of the dozen, you\'ll\r\n_Win-a-Mint_!" Again the theme music. "Now, Don, how about it? 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Think\r\nyou can do it?

=== Chunk 5 ===
"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll try, sir." Gerson looked a little pale, but resolute.\r\n\r\n"All right, folks, give our new Robinson Crusoe a big hand, and be sure\r\nyou\'re watching when we bring him back to try to _Win-a-Mint_!" And the\r\nclock blinked a red light. Right on the button, Lonigan thought.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe helicopter droned out over the open sea in the afternoon sun. It\r\nwas much noisier than the airliner that had been Gerson\'s only other\r\ntrip into the upper air, he thought, looking ahead. The island was not\r\nyet visible.\r\n\r\n"Think you\'ll win the hundred thousand?" the pilot asked, speaking\r\nloudly. He was a young man of Gerson\'s own age, with a cheerful round\r\nface.\r\n\r\n"What? Oh ... I certainly hope so." 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Gerson peered out over the smooth\r\nwater. "How long a trip is it?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, not so long now," the pilot assured him. "Nice little island,\r\ntoo. I wouldn\'t mind this deal even if I didn\'t get the money. It\'s a\r\nfirst class vacation, hey?"\r\n\r\n"I guess it is," Gerson said. "Kind of lonesome, though."\r\n\r\n"Well, if they\'d sent a girl too, you might not want to come back," the\r\npilot grinned. "Anyway, think about all that money. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
That\'ll keep you\r\nfrom feeling too lonesome."\r\n\r\nGerson smiled back at him.\r\n\r\n"I sure could do a lot with it," he said.\r\n\r\n"I remember getting stuck up at Thule Two, up in the Arctic, when I was\r\nflying commercial last year," the pilot said. "Nobody there but a radio\r\nman and another pilot. Too cold to go outside, even. _That\'s_ what I\'d\r\ncall lonesome."\r\n\r\nOn the horizon, a blue-green ridge began to lift above the water line.\r\n\r\n"There it is," said the pilot. "Be there in another five minutes."\r\n\r\nThe copter landed on a long, smooth beach, with a picture postcard\r\nocean lapping at the white sand. The pilot showed Don around the\r\nplace with an almost proprietorial pride, pointing out the various\r\nconveniences, and giving advice.\r\n\r\n"The house is a real doll," he told Don. "Never lived in. A rich fella\r\nowned the place, and was going to use it for vacations, but he never\r\ngot around to it. Incidentally, it\'ll be for sale when the stunt\'s\r\nover. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
Whopping price, too, I\'ll bet."\r\n\r\nThere was hot and cold running water, an electrical system powered by\r\na gas engine, furniture, even a pair of swimming trunks hanging in a\r\ncloset with other clothes.\r\n\r\n"There\'s a laugh," the pilot observed, pointing to the trunks. "You\r\nwon\'t need _them_."\r\n\r\n"Well, if I go swimming ..." Don said.\r\n\r\n"The swimming\'s fine, but you won\'t have any company to worry about\r\nwhat you wear," the pilot said. Don had never been entirely alone\r\nin his life; it took him a moment to grasp this small detail in the\r\npicture of his immediate future.\r\n\r\n"Oh," he said, doubtfully. "Well, you know there\'s seaweed and all\r\nthat...."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, there was very little seaweed. The water was warm,\r\nand the days that followed were cloudless perfection; the nights were\r\ncool, and there was always a steady sea-breeze.\r\n\r\nAt first, for a few days, Don Gerson found himself moving in a pattern\r\nwhich resembled his normal life very closely. He awoke at seven; in\r\nfact, on the first morning, he found himself compelled to rise at once\r\nand dress. That first morning, he had an odd, lost feeling; there was\r\nno office to go to, no schedule of work to follow, no fixed orbit.\r\n\r\nHe began the first day by shaving and cooking himself what, for\r\nhim, was a large breakfast. He thought about going for a swim, but\r\nremembered the rule he had been given once, about not swimming for two\r\nhours after eating.\r\n\r\nThe clothes that hung in the closets were not what he would have\r\nselected himself, but they were comfortable, and they fitted. He\r\ndressed in slacks and an open-necked shirt; then proceeded to\r\ninvestigate the library.\r\n\r\nFor a few days his pattern was like that of this first day. He read\r\nthe back-number piles of news magazines, the books analyzing current\r\npolitics and history; he ate at regular intervals, and twice he went\r\nswimming for short periods. On both occasions he wore the trunks, and\r\nthe second swim was very short. He came out of the water feeling as if,\r\nas he said to himself, "there wasn\'t anything _to_ it." In his life,\r\nswimming alone had never seemed to happen.\r\n\r\nDon hardly noticed the pattern beginning to fray apart. On the fifth\r\nday he overslept, and did not get up until nearly eleven. That night he\r\nfelt wakeful, and at midnight, he ate sardines and beans. He left the\r\ncans on the kitchen table, and did not drop them into the pit behind\r\nthe house as he had been doing.\r\n\r\nThe next morning he did not rise till noon. In fact, he did not even\r\nwind the alarm clock. It ran down the same day, and he tried to guess\r\nat the time when he set it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was a typewriter, and a stack of paper. Don began to set down his\r\ngeneral view of the way that events would be happening in the outside\r\nworld, trying to anticipate every possible question. He assumed, to\r\nbegin with, that the questions would not be too obscure; but that left\r\na large area of possibilities, anyway.\r\n\r\nEach day he wrote for several hours, and read for several more.\r\nSometimes he would get too interested in some line of reading that\r\nwould take him into areas which, he felt, would not be likely to enter\r\nthe questions. At first he pulled himself out of those lines with an\r\nabrupt snapping shut of the offending book. But for three days he got\r\nfarther and farther afield on a line that began with a book on a recent\r\narchaeological expedition and led him through a file of _National\r\nGeographics_, clear back to the article on Ancient Egypt in the\r\nencyclopedia. From that point he found it harder and harder to guess\r\nat the possible line that the questions might take, and he wrote on in\r\nany direction his fancy took.\r\n\r\n_If the questions dealt with the elections_, he wrote, _the first\r\npossible ones might be on the names of the candidates. Also, the\r\nplatforms and general tendencies. Now, the possible Democratic party\r\ncandidates are...._\r\n\r\nAnd again, _There might be another change in Soviet politics, but in\r\nthe articles in_ Time _and in_ The Reporter _the writers say that the\r\npresent group is likely to continue in power for at least a while.\r\nHowever, if he should ask about something which sounds as if it went in\r\nthat direction, I could assume that the present premier might die; he\'s\r\nold, and can\'t live much longer._\r\n\r\nDon had always been a baseball fan, and his opinions in that area were\r\nfirmly rooted in both his own past and in the thick file of sports\r\npages of newspapers. _The Dodgers will probably win the pennant, and\r\nthe Giants will probably sell their pitcher Joe Kenner. In boxing...._\r\n\r\nHe was fairly certain about the outcome of various sports events. But\r\nwhen it came to science, he discovered whole worlds of which he had\r\nonly heard vaguely before. There were things which he understood only\r\nwith difficulty, and he began to realize, with a sense of shock, how\r\ninadequate his school "science" classes had been. But he didn\'t worry;\r\nhe could easily predict that this class of question would have to do\r\neither with something medical or something about atomics. He found a\r\ngreat deal of already predicted material in both those fields; every\r\nmagazine had a doctor writing about which disease would be conquered\r\nnext, and how soon; and a number of articles gave details on how soon\r\natomic power plants would be running, and what kinds of bombs would be\r\ntested next.\r\n\r\nDon\'s choice of accountancy had been motivated by a liking for logic\r\nand orderliness; he began to find a fascination in the logic and\r\norderliness of science. His picture of a scientist had been vague at\r\nbest, a picture formed from newspaper photos of Einstein, with his\r\nwhite hair blowing, and of movie scientists, bending over strange\r\nmachines and creating monsters.\r\n\r\nAt one point Don found the history and viewpoints of science drawing\r\nhim into reading that could not possibly be used in the questioning.\r\nReluctantly, and resolving to go back to that area, he moved on.\r\n\r\n_The oil workers union has a contract which runs out next month_, he\r\nwrote, _and they have always had a strike at this point in their last\r\nfew years. If they do strike, there will probably be a temporary\r\nshortage of fuel and gasoline. This might be the right answer if the\r\nquestion is, What strike is affecting the country most now?_\r\n\r\nBack into politics once more, Don began to extend his guessing, as he\r\nread further.\r\n\r\n_The UN investigation of the situation in South Africa will be resumed,\r\nand the South African delegation will withdraw again. It looks as\r\nif there is a very good chance of native rebellions in French North\r\nAfrica, so that a question which pointed to Africa might deal with\r\neither situation._\r\n\r\nAfter a while, Don had worked around to the Far East, and became more\r\nand more interested. His orderly habits led him into a pattern in\r\nwhich he organized the most likely events into a future history which\r\ncovered, in detail, the things that would happen in the whole world,\r\nto a point that went into the next few years. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
In fact, he noticed\r\nabruptly, the vista ahead had grown brightly clear, and was still\r\nextending. He told himself that when he returned, he would continue to\r\nwrite his history of the future.\r\n\r\nJust for fun, though, he said to himself. Nobody would be really\r\ninterested in such a thing except himself, and he was no writer. But it\r\nlooked as if he might have found a real hobby, Don told himself. Why,\r\nhe didn\'t even miss television.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe thought of television reminded him of the money, and the questions.\r\nThe air and an occasional swim, and the food, had all combined to give\r\nhim a feeling of health and relaxation. He felt supremely confident;\r\nhe knew he could cope with the questions. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
And the time must be growing\r\nshort. The plane should be arriving any day.\r\n\r\nDon suddenly realized that he had stopped shaving some time before,\r\nand that he had fallen into the habit of not wearing a shirt. He\r\nshaved, and discovered that he had only two clean shirts left. He also\r\ndiscovered that the freezer was nearly empty, but he remembered seeing\r\na number of plants growing near the house; if the freezer should run\r\nout before the plane arrived, he could grow something, he thought.\r\n\r\nBut the freezer did not run out of supplies. Instead, the generator\r\nstopped. It was out of gas.\r\n\r\nDraining the last of the melted ice from the box, Don suddenly became\r\naware of a simple fact. There should have been enough gas. The tank had\r\nbeen quite full enough to last more than the two months. He suddenly\r\nrealized that he had completely lost count of days, and that the plane\r\nmight be overdue by as much as a week or two.\r\n\r\nFeeling a slight panic, he began to check back through his daily stacks\r\nof writing. He found that he had done an average of eight pages every\r\nday, which gave him a means of counting back. But it was only a rough\r\nestimate, since there had been off days.\r\n\r\nStill, the count came out to at least three months. The plane was very\r\ndefinitely overdue.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the third year, he completed a radio receiver, made\r\nfrom wire stripped from the useless generator and using the crystal\r\nreceiver principle. It had a pinpoint balanced on an old razor blade.\r\nThere had been a description of the method of making such a receiver\r\nin a mechanics magazine, and Don had done it carefully. It took him a\r\nlong time, because he did not find the job very interesting except when\r\nhe was tired of reading and writing. Also, he had spent a long time\r\nextracting the blank leaves from all of the books so that he would have\r\nplenty of writing paper.\r\n\r\nThe receiver seemed to be a workable design. However, all he could hear\r\nwas a steady crackle and hiss, and, during storms, the sounds made by\r\ndistant lightning.\r\n\r\nThings went well, otherwise. His garden grew with a minimum of\r\nattention; he had learned the easiest methods of fishing, and he could\r\nnot have named a single thing that he did not have that he would want.\r\n\r\nThe history grew longer. It was bound, volume by volume, in covers\r\nremoved from books that were then piled carefully away. Don had found\r\na way to bleach out the pages of printed matter, but there were only\r\na few books that he could bring himself to turn into writing paper in\r\nthis manner. In his notes, he used the term "palimpsest"; he knew what\r\nit meant by now.\r\n\r\n_2234. The last queen of England, not possessing any political power,\r\nwas nevertheless regarded with great respect by the people of Britain,\r\nand her death at an advanced age was the occasion for great public\r\nmourning. However, since she had left no direct descendant, her\r\nentombment in the rebuilt Westminster Abbey marked the final end of the\r\nmonarchy, even as a symbol._\r\n\r\n_The year 2234 also marked the first serious attempt to cross\r\ninterstellar space, in a giant ship which was built to house a large\r\ncolony of travelers for a long time._\r\n\r\n_Among the books published in 2234 were new works by the famous\r\nhistorian and scholar Nosreg, and his contemporary Songre. "The Tragedy\r\nof Man" by the playwright Gresno played to great audiences over the\r\nSolar Television Network...._\r\n\r\nThoughtfully, Don pulled at his graying beard. He was considering the\r\nplays of Gresno, and feeling, very mildly, a longing to see them. But,\r\nhe reminded himself, it would be a long time before Gresno would even\r\nbe born. Meanwhile, the afternoon sun was warm against his back, here\r\non the porch, and he still had a great deal of white paper. He took up\r\nthe sea-gull quill and began to write once more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
