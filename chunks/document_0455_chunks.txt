=== Chunk 2 ===
Hurry! Run as fast as you can go to the big tree! Crouch beneath\r\nits branches and hide, staring up through its open spaces to see if\r\nanything is glinting in the clear sky. Anything there? 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Oh God, yes! No,\r\nit\'s only a bird, a small cloud drifting. Now! Dash madly, crawl on\r\nyour belly, fight on to the next place of concealment!\r\n\r\nWinston Eberly knew he was talking to himself, but he didn\'t give a\r\ndamn. He was sweating and sick from exertion, half mad with burning\r\nthirst and bleeding from an unknown number of cuts and scratches, but\r\nthat didn\'t matter either. The only thing that had any real meaning or\r\nvalue was the stuff in the box in his pocket.\r\n\r\nHe slapped the pocket with a dirt-encrusted hand. "Good old box! Good\r\nold U-235!" he mumbled feverishly. "You\'ll pull us out of this mess\r\nwe\'re in. You\'ll show the blasted men from space they\'re not playing\r\nwith children!"\r\n\r\nPausing in shadows he looked again at the sky. All blue and quiet.\r\nNothing stirring up there, nothing glinting. But they were there all\r\nright; they were always there. Maybe they were in the stratosphere,\r\nmaybe above it, or about to streak low across the sky from horizon to\r\nhorizon in the twinkling of an eye.\r\n\r\nMen from space. Hateful, sadistic, repulsive men from outer space!\r\nOh, how overbearing they were; how greedy and cruel and how sure of\r\nthemselves! They had reason to be confident, of course. They had simply\r\nstood far off in space and shrouded the entire world in a terrible\r\nradiation that brought unconsciousness to all and death to many. And\r\nsomething in that radiation had sought out every particle of refined\r\nUranium and Hiroshimaized the world.\r\n\r\nOne had to respect that power, if not admire it. Even now, they could\r\nbring quick death to every single Earthman by simply pressing a\r\nbutton somewhere in their one established city, in the Sahara Desert.\r\nClever. It seemed they could do anything. Why wouldn\'t electric and\r\ninternal combustion motors run since the coming of the space men? More\r\nimportant, how could their high-flying ships detect even the slightest\r\nunauthorized action on the ground below?\r\n\r\nThey had the world in their power, right enough, and even darkness\r\nbrought the Earthmen no chance to strike back. The invaders called\r\ntheir ships back to the Sahara at dusk and at dusk all good little\r\nEarthmen went to bed, or went strangely to sleep where they stood.\r\n\r\nEberly called an end to his watchful reflections and darted into the\r\nopen again like a frightened doe. This was the only chance and here,\r\nbetween the hidden place where determined men had worked tirelessly and\r\ningeniously to refine only a small capsule of pure Uranium in a year\r\nand the hidden place where other learned men waited to incorporate the\r\nproduct into an atomic bomb that could destroy the city of the invaders\r\ncompletely, lay the greatest danger of defeat.\r\n\r\nAs he stumbled on toward his goal he cursed the power that made all\r\nmodern conveyances impossible. This snail\'s pace across open country,\r\nunder the cosmic microscope of the alien invaders, was maddening, with\r\nso much at stake. But it was no more so than the task of mining and\r\nrefining ore or that of constructing an atomic bomb without the aid of\r\nmodern machinery, no more so than being forced to live practically like\r\nwild animals as all must now do.\r\n\r\nHe swore to himself that a way would be--had to be--found to get that\r\nweapon across to the enemy once it was constructed. The steam engine\r\nhad not been in use for years, but it would still work, and balloons,\r\ndirigibles, would still rise into the air. It might take another year\r\nor two years, but the invaders would learn that Earthmen don\'t give up\r\neasily. A way would be found!\r\n\r\nThen it happened; the thing that made Winston Eberly curse and sweat\r\nand retract his noble thoughts. There would be no pitiful steam-powered\r\ndirigible or any other weapon carrier. What need for one, when the\r\nbomb, itself, would never be completed? The men waiting for the Uranium\r\nwere never going to see it!\r\n\r\nWithout warning, something tugged at him, passed away and returned,\r\nunseen and weird. He took one straining step--two, and knew that he\r\nwouldn\'t take another. Like the petrified terror of dreams he strained\r\nagainst his unseen bonds, unable to lift or swing an arm.\r\n\r\nAbove his head a branch of a tree twisted and snapped, pulled away and\r\nhung suspended in mid-air. The branch remained the same distance above\r\nhim as his feet left the ground. Its shadows still fell across him as\r\nthe tops of trees swam below him.\r\n\r\nYes, it was the invaders. Up there, somewhere above him--he was unable\r\nto move his head to see where--they hovered safely out of reach of\r\nthe fanatic hate of Earthmen and drew him up to them like a fish on\r\na hook. He didn\'t mind for himself, but the U-235, a whole year of\r\nback-breaking work for his fellows, the very life, and freedom of Earth\r\nwas being offered up to sad memories with him!\r\n\r\nHe choked back curses and sobs of frustration while he soared higher\r\nand tried to think. They would get the Uranium, those parodies of\r\norganic life, and that wasn\'t right. He had to get rid of it, hide it,\r\nthrow it away! But how? How, when he was rising up through open air,\r\nunable to move a finger, could he dispose of it?\r\n\r\nA dark shadow fell over him. An opening suction-cupped down around him\r\nand clanged shut. Only then did the terrible force that held him in its\r\nembrace subside. Only then was he able to move freely and his first\r\nthought, his first action, was to snatch the small box from his pocket\r\nand pry it open with shaking fingers.\r\n\r\nHe couldn\'t let the invaders profit in any way from the sweat of\r\nEarthmen. He had to dispose of that precious capsule at once! But--how?\r\nThere were only smooth metal walls around him; no holes, no ledges, not\r\na single hiding place for it and no way to get it out of the ship!\r\n\r\nThere was a whirring sound and a thin slit of light showed from inside\r\nthe ship, widened. Suddenly, impulsively, he thrust the capsule into\r\nhis mouth, swallowed, gagged and gulped it on down. Not a very good\r\nhiding place. It might make him sick. But the invaders would never get\r\nit. If they did they would have to dig for it.\r\n\r\nThe blue-skinned man from space seemed to be having trouble with the\r\nEnglish language. Evidently it bore absolutely no relation to his\r\nnative tongue. The combination of his serious, arrogant manner and his\r\ndistorted speech was almost humorous.\r\n\r\n"Give me why you have with that emotion we pick up on ours detector,"\r\nhe barked harshly. "At ones! 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Or I take you in torture to tell!"\r\n\r\n"Go to hell!"\r\n\r\n"What was that box around? Where did you do with the inside-of-box\r\nthing? Give reply! 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Quickly at ones!

=== Chunk 6 ===
"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t hear you."\r\n\r\nThe blue skin of the man from space turned purple. "I am in soft\r\ntalking for you now," he thundered, getting his language a little more\r\nconfused in his anger. "In the later it is much harder with you to\r\nbe so when you do not give now! Maybe it is be you hear we are only\r\nsurvivors of a race that is boom out by other-race nations on world\r\nhome of us. Yes, you know this? You maybe think it is why we are in\r\nrunning here from there because we are little in courage and you are\r\nbigger, so you can say Hell to us without hurt. Yessir? Then why we\r\nare able of holding all of you in sleep at dark times? Now! We are so\r\nlittle in all that we are able to make each of ten zones sleep as soon\r\nwhen dark comes to each zone and can keep all Earthmen down under with\r\nonly five ships at a time to watch the five zones that are light at\r\na time! See! 

=== Chunk 7 ===
You will see when you don\'t hear talking and are saying\r\nHell!"\r\n\r\nEberly shook beads of perspiration from his face. It was unbearably hot\r\ninside the ship. He forced a grin.\r\n\r\n"Well, Windy," he addressed the space man defiantly, "I see that the\r\nart of bragging isn\'t strictly confined to Earth. Thanks for the\r\ninformation anyway. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
I might be able to use it some day."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The effect was amazing._]\r\n\r\nThe purple face blanched to powder blue. The owner spouted a stream of\r\nhis native language that sounded to Eberly like nothing recognizable\r\nand threw up his hands in resignation.\r\n\r\nOnly five ships out at a time, Eberly thought as two hefty space men\r\nprodded him back toward the air-lock. All but a few of the invaders\r\nhuddled together in a single city that could be utterly destroyed by\r\nthe blast of one atomic bomb. Such a blast would also destroy the great\r\nradiation generators that held Earthmen in sway and the few remaining\r\ninvaders would soon be overcome or driven away. And he was walking\r\naround with the only fuel for such a weapon in his stomach!\r\n\r\nThey were crowding him into the air-lock now. What were they going to\r\ndo? Not turn him loose. Dump him into space?\r\n\r\nA moment later, he knew. In only a few minutes they had come all the\r\nway from America to Africa! These men from space had science, all\r\nright. They must have learned how to overcome inertia somehow without\r\ngiving the sensation of change in motion. He hadn\'t been aware of the\r\nslightest motion, yet he saw their city as soon as the outer seal of\r\nthe lock opened and there was no mistaking that city.\r\n\r\nHe was out of the ship and onto the rubbery surface of a street,\r\nbeing hurried, pushed along it toward some unknown destination. His\r\ncaptors bullied him along between tall, smooth buildings that seemed\r\nto be constructed of solid expanses of plastic, broken only by the\r\nunrevealing doors and windows.\r\n\r\nThe people in the streets didn\'t jeer at or mock him. They only looked\r\nat him as one might look at a stinking, stray dog or simply ignored him\r\ncompletely. That was worse.\r\n\r\nHe was suddenly pushed into a flight of steps and stumbled up them,\r\nin through broad doors. There were more steps and endless halls and\r\nelevators that took you up or down with no sensation of motion and\r\nfinally a room, a laboratory of some sort it seemed.\r\n\r\nThe one who had tried to question Eberly aboard the ship had followed\r\nalong. He spoke to the man they found in the room. He might have been\r\nspeaking mainly for Eberly\'s benefit, because he spoke in what he\r\ncalled English.\r\n\r\n"This one is in need to explain some things, but is not willing to say\r\nthose thing," he sneered. "You are for making him hear what is say to\r\nhim and to reply with not insults. Make it at once."\r\n\r\nEberly was feeling a little ill. A diet of U-235, he realized, was not\r\nso good. He just couldn\'t help it. He belched loudly.\r\n\r\nEyes turned toward him; puzzled eyes with questions in them.\r\n\r\n"What is that big word you are make? What it does mean?"\r\n\r\n"It has been called a \'burp\'," Eberly said. "As far as you are\r\nconcerned, you can think of it as the worst insult you know of." The\r\nUranium capsule was a hard lump in his stomach. He didn\'t know much\r\nabout Uranium--whether it was some effect of the Uranium or just the\r\nindigestibility of it--but he was feeling sicker by the minute. Pain\r\nstabbed across his chest and he burped again.\r\n\r\nEvidently, the space men could think of some pretty raw insults,\r\njudging from the expressions on their faces.\r\n\r\n"Silent, dog you!" he shouted, purple-faced. Then, to his two bullies,\r\n"Make him tight with chains to the wall! He must be teach not to make\r\nburp of us and to give true talk when told! 

=== Chunk 9 ===
When I am return he is to\r\nbe made talking!" He slammed out of the room as if he were ready to\r\ntake off for America without his ship.\r\n\r\nA number of the space men had crowded into the room to watch the\r\ntorture of an Earthman. Their eyes, small sadistic eyes, glistened with\r\nthe interest of bad boys watching a fish drown with a stick propping\r\nopen its mouth or the antics of a frightened dog with a can tied to its\r\ntail. Or maybe it stirred some hidden emotion within them that would\r\ndrive a bad boy insane.\r\n\r\nWinston Eberly had felt hideous insects swarming over his body and\r\ngouging at his flesh, had turned numb under heat extracting beams\r\nfollowed by heat rays that sent agony racing through his every nerve.\r\nThey wanted him to scream with pain. They wanted him to be the perfect\r\nslave, bowing and scraping and speaking softly and obediently. He\r\nwouldn\'t give in, damn them! He hadn\'t yet given in and he wouldn\'t,\r\never! Let them torture him to the death, and then, what more could they\r\ndo? What could they do except realize that Earthmen would fight to the\r\nend?\r\n\r\n"You make good talk now?"\r\n\r\nEberly lifted his head weakly, stared his hate at the questioning eyes\r\nthat pressed close in front of him, struggled to put unfelt strength\r\ninto his voice.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you know an Earthman is ready to suffer anything for honor?\r\nDon\'t you realize that none of us will rest until an atomic bomb has\r\nsent all of you drifting with the wind? No! 

=== Chunk 10 ===
I will not bow to you! Kill\r\nme and you gain nothing."\r\n\r\nHis head drooped again as giddy grayness fogged his eyes. Faintly, he\r\nheard something akin to laughter from the hateful creatures around him.\r\nLaughing! What were they laughing about? What had he said?\r\n\r\n"So! The little Earthdog has exploded the fine particle!" His torturer\r\nanswered his unspoken question. "The childish scum of this world are\r\ndone things that ours great science cannot do. Fools! You are base your\r\nhopes on a dream, a deception! Those enemy of us are reach you with\r\nmessage. Those enemy that drive us from home world are inform you that\r\nwe come this way before we are come. Then you make many big explodes to\r\nscare us from here with thought of exploding particles atoms. Ha! We\r\nare not fool to come convince of the impossible!"\r\n\r\nThe import of the words cleared Eberly\'s head a little. What was\r\nthis? Was it possible that the great science of this race had never\r\ndiscovered atomic power? Maybe there was some condition in their\r\ndistant system that prevented nuclear fission or perhaps they had never\r\nfound a suitable substance for experimentation. So the men from space\r\nthought nuclear fission impossible, did they?\r\n\r\nHis thought was almost a voice, and the voice said. "Here in your\r\nintestines lies a glass capsule and that capsule contains pure Uranium!\r\nenough to blast this city from the face of the earth, and the invaders\r\nare unsuspecting!"\r\n\r\nThe torturer had gone aside to talk to another. Eberly looked toward\r\nthem. "Why not kill me and have it done with?" he shouted. "You know\r\nnow that you can\'t subdue an Earthman. Your methods are all weak. Even\r\nthe radiation with which you took Earth could not kill all of us. It\'s\r\nas weak and faulty as everything else you have."\r\n\r\nHis torturer took the bait. He came to where Eberly hung in his chains.\r\n"It are weak, is it so?" he sneered. "It are so weak you would how like\r\nto make squirm under such radiate?"\r\n\r\nEberly let fear show in his eyes. "I--I--didn\'t mean it that way," he\r\nstammered. "You can\'t really use it here, can you--on me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. Oh yes but yes!" The other seemed pleased. Now, he thought, he\r\nwas getting some results. "We can make little or much radiate. Just\r\nright for make scream from you, maybe yes. You are in fear from that? 

=== Chunk 11 ===
I\r\nthink you are make good talk by some time."\r\n\r\nIt was with mixed emotions that Eberly watched the camera-like device\r\nbeing wheeled into the room. He was filled with elation and hate and\r\nnoble thoughts all at the same time. And there was doubt, too. What if\r\nthe torturer should somehow realize what he was trying to do? What if\r\nsome other torture were used before the radiation and would result in\r\ndeath? He had to prevent that. He would have to make their overbearing\r\npride work for him.\r\n\r\n"No!" he protested as the projection rods of the radiation generator\r\nwere turned toward him. "Please, don\'t use that on me. I\'ll--I\'ll do\r\nanything you want, only don\'t turn that on me."\r\n\r\nThe torturer brightened while murmurs of self-praise rose from the\r\nwatchers. "Oh, you are not think us are so weak now! Then say to me why\r\nyou are in the emotion we are detect and bring you here against." He\r\nbent his head close to Eberly\'s, better to hear the sweet music of this\r\nEarth fool\'s whining.\r\n\r\nEberly belched in his face.\r\n\r\n"Burp, burp, burp?" the torturer shouted foolishly, stepping back. "You\r\ntry make fool with us, oh? 

=== Chunk 12 ===
Very and well! We see how you say burp when\r\nyou get this!" He made a final adjustment on the radiation generator.\r\n\r\nIt was working! Anger flared in the eyes of the torturer, in the eyes\r\nof the watchers. Eberly fed it. "I\'m not afraid of you," he taunted.\r\n"Why should I fear cowards who run from their home world because they\r\nhaven\'t the guts to stay and fight?"\r\n\r\nThe effects of his words were amazing, cutting sharply at a sore spot\r\nin the minds of the space men. The watchers growled oaths, some of them\r\nleaping to their feet. The torturer, his face nearly black with anger,\r\nreached up and depressed a lever on the radiation generator, spitefully.\r\n\r\nWinston Eberly burped for the last time. It was a terrible,\r\nfrightening, destructive, big burp. It could be felt for miles. The\r\nforce of it knocked gulls from the sky over the Mediterranean. It shook\r\nbuildings and rattled windows in Italy. And, when the smoke cleared\r\naway, there was not the slightest doubt that the mighty expulsion of\r\nWinston Eberly had done its work well.\r\n\r\nSoon the few remaining space men returned to look down with troubled\r\neyes upon that boiling crater. They circled and puzzled and spoke sad\r\nwords. Then they pointed the noses of their ships up toward open space\r\nand proved once more that they were brave only when they held the upper\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
