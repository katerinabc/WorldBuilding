SMITH\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n                    Startling Stories Summer 1955.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe house\'s electronic brain glowed with an intangible thing that might\r\nhave been pride.\r\n\r\nIt thought, I am content. I am content because there are so many\r\nthings I can do to make them happy. I can cook their meals, make the\r\nbeds, scrub my floors, wash my windows. I can bathe them, keep them\r\nwarm, give them a gentle, cool breeze. If they want entertainment, I\r\ncan rise hundreds of feet on my antigravity rays and give them a nice\r\nview. I can give them soft music, entertaining TV programs and pleasant\r\nsurprises.\r\n\r\nThe house activated one of the many telescopic scanners on the roof and\r\nwatched its owners as their car sped down the narrow road toward the\r\ncity. It thought, They are so young, so nice, so kind to each other\r\nand myself. She speaks to me with affection and he spends many hours\r\nlearning how I operate. She will love me and he will be proud of me and\r\ntake good care of me. I am glad they own me!\r\n\r\nIt deactivated the scanner and from hidden closets, shiny machines\r\nquietly entered the many rooms. The tiny machines rolled on soft\r\nrubber wheels, floated on invisible antigravity rays and went about\r\ntheir many tasks. They sucked in dust and dirt, waxed the floors,\r\nwashed the dishes. Behind the smooth gray walls, machines prepared the\r\nevening meal, checked the video schedule for the afternoon and selected\r\nrecordings of soft music that the house\'s owners would enjoy.\r\n\r\n_Bing-bong._\r\n\r\nThe doorbell activated certain electrical circuits and the small\r\nporch was splashed with gentle light. A polite voice from a concealed\r\nmicrophone said, "No one is home. Would you care to leave a message?"\r\n\r\nPolitely, the house\'s electronic brain waited for a reply. There was\r\nnone. "Goodbye," the house said.\r\n\r\nIt felt a key in the front door. It was not like _their_ key. It did\r\nnot fit snugly. This key wasn\'t meant for its front door. It hurt\r\nslightly but it opened the door.\r\n\r\nThe intruders stepped into the foyer.\r\n\r\nThree infra-red scanners peered at the two strangers.\r\n\r\nOne was a woman. Long, blond hair. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
Gray eyes. Small pointed nose. Blue\r\ndress and blue, high-heel shoes. The house evaluated her, discarded\r\nthe word "beautiful" and decided on the words "curvaceous" and "sexy."\r\nYes, it would use those words to describe her to its owners when they\r\nreturned. It wondered briefly if they were relatives of its masters.\r\n\r\nThe man was short, stocky. Dark hair, brown eyes. The house searched\r\nits files but could not find any complimentary adjectives. It spoke.\r\n"No one is home. Would you care to leave a message?" It wished it could\r\ninquire as to what they wanted, but there were no circuits for that.\r\n\r\n"Shut up," the man said.\r\n\r\n"Beg pardon?"\r\n\r\n"Shut up! _Keep quiet!_"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," the house responded. It was constructed to obey orders, but\r\n_that_ order was an unfamiliar one which it didn\'t like.\r\n\r\n"Tell it to turn on the lights," the woman said nervously.\r\n\r\n"Turn the lights on."\r\n\r\nThe house waited several seconds. It was obliged to obey orders of\r\nguests. But were these people guests? It searched memory circuits.\r\nGuests were people who came to visit while owners were home. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Guests\r\nwere friendly, talkative. The house decided this man and woman did not\r\nfit in that category of identification.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHurriedly, it searched its myriad electrical networks and found the\r\nonly logical description of the intruders--burglars.\r\n\r\nBehind the walls, relays clicked and infinitesimal electrical charges\r\ndarted across a spidery web of silver wires only to find themselves in\r\nthe dead-ends of missing connections.\r\n\r\nThe anti-burglar installations are missing! the house thought\r\nfrantically. If the protective devices had been present, it would have\r\nbeen able to spray the intruders with tear gas, paralyze them with\r\nelectrical charges, thrust them from the house with antigravity rays,\r\nor kill them by any one of a dozen methods. Without the anti-burglar\r\nmechanisms, it was defenseless. What can I do? the house wondered. What\r\ncan I do!\r\n\r\nReluctantly, the house turned the lights on.\r\n\r\n"You sure the burglar alarms haven\'t been installed?" the woman asked\r\nanxiously.\r\n\r\n"Hell. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Do you think I\'d come here if I wasn\'t sure? I told you I talked\r\nto the construction man. There\'s a shortage right now. They won\'t be\r\nput in until next week. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
The family doesn\'t know--the company didn\'t\r\nwant to lose a sale."\r\n\r\nThe woman\'s eyes widened with admiration as they scanned the hardwood\r\nfloors, ankle-deep scatter rugs, angular furniture, large picture\r\nwindows, wall-to-wall bookcase and abstract multidimension paintings.\r\n\r\n"They must have money," she commented. "How do we find the--"\r\n\r\nThe man snapped muscular fingers with a sharp, cracking sound. "We\'ll\r\nask the house!"\r\n\r\nA momentary silence. Then, the man\'s gruff voice: "House, where\'s the\r\nsafe?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot divulge that information." It felt proud when it didn\'t\r\nhesitate in its answer. There were many things it couldn\'t tell anyone\r\nand it had carefully memorized them: its cost, its female owner\'s age,\r\nanything relating to the owners\' sex or personal life--and, mainly, the\r\nlocation of various things, including the safe.\r\n\r\n"Tell us!" the man shouted.\r\n\r\n"No.

=== Chunk 6 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Damn you!"\r\n\r\n"Beg pardon?"\r\n\r\n"Go to hell!"\r\n\r\nRelays clicked silently behind the gray walls. It had been instructed\r\nat the factory to explain when it couldn\'t obey an order. It searched\r\nits dictionary circuits and said mechanically, "Hell: a noun. The place\r\nof the dead or departed souls, (more correctly Hades); the place of\r\npunishment for the wicked after death. I have no soul, therefore I\r\ncannot go to hell. I am sorry."\r\n\r\nThe woman laughed. "Let\'s start looking. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
We got hours."\r\n\r\nThe house watched as the strangers searched the room. It watched as the\r\nman took a knife from his pocket and ripped through the upholstery of a\r\nchair.\r\n\r\n"Please stop," the house implored.\r\n\r\nThe strangers did not reply.\r\n\r\nAn unpleasant sensation rippled through the house\'s electrical\r\ncircuits. It wanted to make its owners happy. They wouldn\'t be happy\r\nwhen they returned and saw the ruined furniture. They would be sad,\r\nperhaps angry. She would cry and he would frown.\r\n\r\nIt tried again, "Please stop."\r\n\r\nThe woman was removing books from the bookcase; the man continued\r\nsearching the furniture.\r\n\r\nThey wouldn\'t stop when it asked them to. If it only had the burglar\r\ndevices! Now, there was no way for it to fight.\r\n\r\nOr is there? it wondered.\r\n\r\nThe lights went off.\r\n\r\n"Turn the lights on!" the woman screamed.\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Use the flashlight," the man said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, two beams of light slashed through the darkened room.\r\nThe strangers resumed their search.\r\n\r\nThe house thought, They\'re trying to find the safe containing the\r\nmoney and jewels. I can\'t tell them where it is.\r\n\r\nI can\'t stop them. I need help.\r\n\r\nIt cut into the phone circuits and dialed the number of its factory.\r\nThe phone\'s visiscreen flared with light and a woman\'s face appeared\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\n"Johnson Construction Company."\r\n\r\nThe house projected its voice toward the mouthpiece. "Please, let me\r\nspeak to--"\r\n\r\nThe man removed a weapon from his tunic. The phone and visiscreen\r\nvanished, leaving only small metal fragments that fell to the carpet.\r\n\r\n"It was using the phone!" the woman exclaimed shrilly, trembling in the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t worry," the man said. "They didn\'t have time to trace the call.\r\nThe room was dark; they couldn\'t see who was calling."\r\n\r\nAfter a brief silence, the man warned, "House! See this thing in my\r\nhand? You behave yourself or I\'ll disintegrate your...." He let the\r\nsentence dangle, unable to think of what he would disintegrate.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," the house replied. It was an automatic response to any\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\n"Now, turn the lights on or I\'ll use this gun to make one big mess of\r\nyour floors and walls. Your owners wouldn\'t like that, would they?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir."\r\n\r\nIt turned the lights on. If it didn\'t, they would use their\r\nflashlights, and by turning them on it might prevent some destruction.\r\n\r\nThe woman chuckled. "You\'re a genius!"\r\n\r\nWhen they finished their search of the living room, the man suggested,\r\n"Let\'s search different rooms. You take a bedroom. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
I\'ll take the dining\r\nroom. No telling where the safe is. They put it in a different place in\r\nevery house."\r\n\r\nThe house waited, its electronic brain whirling.\r\n\r\nIt made a decision.\r\n\r\nSilently, the house erected an invisible energy screen around the\r\ndining room. The screens were designed to block collective sounds\r\nof the entire house from any room and provide it with a comforting\r\nserenity.\r\n\r\nNow, the house thought, the sound-screens will be most useful!\r\n\r\nThe house watched as the man in the wrinkled brown tunic examined a\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nSilently, panels in the walls opened.\r\n\r\nA dozen machines a foot in diameter converged at a position behind the\r\nman\'s back.\r\n\r\nThe machines moved simultaneously, silently. They attached themselves\r\nto the intruder\'s body. They dusted and scrubbed him thoroughly, as if\r\nhe were a piece of furniture or a floor.\r\n\r\nThe man screamed and fired wildly with the gun. The small machines\r\ncrumpled one by one.\r\n\r\nClick ... click ... click.\r\n\r\n"Your weapon is empty," the house observed.\r\n\r\nThe man threw the gun at a window. It bounced off the hard plastic and\r\nclattered on the floor.\r\n\r\n"You try something like that again," he threatened, "and I\'ll kill you!\r\nSo help me, I\'ll kill you if I have to take you apart piece by piece!"\r\nHe shook a trembling fist at the quiet walls and twisted his face into\r\na hideous snarl.\r\n\r\nThe house noticed with satisfaction that the man\'s face and hands were\r\ncovered with crimson streaks. The cleaning machines had served their\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThe house deactivated the dining room scanners and activated scanners\r\nin the bedrooms.\r\n\r\nIt found the woman in its owners\' bedroom. It studied her as she\r\nsearched a mattress. She was calm: because of its precaution, the\r\nsounds of the dining room fracas hadn\'t reached her ears. The house\r\ndecided to leave the sound-blocks on. It was best to attack them\r\nindividually.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA closet door slid into a wall. A slender machine, five feet tall and\r\nwith sixteen long metal tentacles rolled across the room on soft rubber\r\nwheels.\r\n\r\nIt looked like a mechanical monster from another world, but it was\r\nmerely a very efficient machine to undress the house\'s masters--a\r\nmechavalet.\r\n\r\nThe mechavalet paused behind the woman\'s back. Sixteen rubber-tipped\r\nmetal tentacles reached out.\r\n\r\nThe machine normally undressed a person with smoothness and gentleness.\r\nThis time the house made it operate as roughly as possible.\r\n\r\nThe sixteen tentacles moved swiftly and the machine tore the woman\'s\r\ndress to shreds before she could even scream. By the time she turned\r\naround, it had removed her slip and brassiere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Her dress was torn to shreds.]\r\n\r\nThe woman screamed even more shrilly as the weird machine tugged at her\r\npanties. Frantically, she grabbed the slender tentacles and twisted\r\nthem until rewarded by the crunch of delicate mechanisms not meant for\r\nsuch rough treatment.\r\n\r\nThe machine served its purpose until its last metal arm was broken.\r\n\r\nThe house watched as the woman cried for a few minutes and then, clad\r\nonly in high-heel shoes and wristwatch, continued her search of the\r\nbedroom.\r\n\r\nShe is different, the house thought. She does not scream threats at me\r\nlike the man does. Still, I do not like her because she wants to steal\r\nfrom my masters and does not care what happens to me.\r\n\r\nThe house switched its attention to the man.\r\n\r\nHe had concluded his search of the dining room and was now searching a\r\nguest room. He found the gun the house\'s master had hidden there.\r\n\r\nThe man waved the gun at the motionless walls. "See what I found,\r\nhouse! You try any more funny stuff and I\'ll kill you!"\r\n\r\n"You do not frighten me," the house replied via one of its many hidden\r\nmicrophones. To verify the statement, it turned on the heating units\r\nfull blast.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later, the man stopped his search of a closet when he\r\nnoticed that sweat was rolling off his body as if he were standing at\r\nthe gates of hell itself.\r\n\r\nHe left the closet and shouted at an open door, "Stop it! Do you hear,\r\nstop it!" He shook his head from side to side, violently, as if to\r\nimpress the house with the necessity of obeying.\r\n\r\n"You can\'t stop me with the gun," the house informed him. "There are\r\none hundred and two air-conditioning vents in the house. If you took\r\ntime to find and destroy all of them, you could never leave here before\r\nmy masters return."\r\n\r\nThe man\'s jaw sagged, and with an equal sag of his shoulders he\r\nreturned to his search of the closet.\r\n\r\nThe house deducted, They are burglars, only burglars. They want to\r\nescape before my masters return because they would have to kill them\r\nand they are not murderers.\r\n\r\nThe man grunted with satisfaction when he stopped sweating. And\r\ngrunted with anger when, a few minutes later, the room became so cold\r\nhe was shivering and his breath was like smoke.\r\n\r\nThe house established automatic circuits to give the room a continuous\r\nfluctuation of temperature from extreme heat to extreme coldness every\r\ntwo minutes and turned its attention to the woman.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nStill attired only in shoes and wristwatch, the woman was now searching\r\nthe bathroom.\r\n\r\nQuite by accident, she touched a certain spot of the medicine cabinet\r\nand stared with fascination as the cabinet swung completely around to\r\ndisplay its back which was--the safe. It was unlocked.\r\n\r\nShe grabbed the large metal box inside, opened it, and glanced at the\r\nfew glittering jewels and small bundle of bills.\r\n\r\n"It\'s here!" she cried. She whirled and took a step toward the door.\r\n\r\nThat was as far as she got for several minutes.\r\n\r\nThe bathroom was equipped with automatic dispensers of temporary and\r\npermanent depilatories. The house\'s male master used the temporary\r\ndepilatory to shave with every morning and the house was well\r\nacquainted with their use.\r\n\r\nIt selected the _permanent_ depilatory, and nozzles set in the tile\r\nwalls squirted large gobs of it on the woman\'s head. Slender rubber\r\ntentacles reached out and massaged the depilatory into the hair.\r\nFaucets swung and sprayed jets of warm water.\r\n\r\nIn a few seconds, the woman was completely hairless. She stared with\r\nhorror at the blond hair in the pool of water at her feet. "Was it\r\npermanent?" she wondered aloud.\r\n\r\n"Yes," the house replied.\r\n\r\nShe screamed and picked up a small weighing machine. With\r\nuncontrollable anger, she smashed the machine against the medicine\r\ncabinet.\r\n\r\nWith an equal but emotionless anger, the house squirted soap into her\r\neyes and sprayed her naked body with alternate jets of hot and cold\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe house won the battle.\r\n\r\nThe woman groped blindly for the jewel box and staggered from the\r\nbathroom. The house turned its attention to the man again.\r\n\r\nHe had searched the kitchen without incident, but as he walked toward\r\nthe door a nearby food-dispenser opened. Prunes, waffles, bacon, eggs\r\nand toast left the machine with abnormal speed and struck him.\r\n\r\nHe turned just in time to receive cherry pie, spaghetti and meat balls,\r\nbutter, vegetable soup, and ice cream in his face.\r\n\r\nHe shouted something unprintable at the house, wiped the mess from his\r\nface and took another step toward the door.\r\n\r\nHalf of a watermelon hurtled from the food-dispenser and squashed\r\nagainst his skull. He stumbled, fell and slid.\r\n\r\nHe heard the woman cry, "I found it!" He pulled himself to his feet. He\r\nran into the hall and froze when he saw the naked, hairless apparition\r\nthat stumbled from the bathroom.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor a moment, he forgot the money and gasped, "What happened?"\r\n\r\n"Depilatory," she explained. "The house did it." She wiped soap from\r\nblood-shot eyes with the back of a hand. "When we get out, give me your\r\ngun. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
I want to give this house something to remember!"\r\n\r\nThe man seized the metal box and examined the contents. "Over twenty\r\nthousand, hon. With that, you can buy plenty of wigs." He attempted a\r\nsmile but did succeed when he got a close look at her bald head. He\r\ngrabbed her arm. "Let\'s go! You can put on my coat in the helicar."\r\n\r\nThe woman allowed herself to be dragged through the house, all the\r\nwhile shaking a fist at the house\'s walls and threatening, "You hear\r\nme, house? When I get outside, I\'m going to burn you! You\'ll make a\r\nnice little bonfire!"\r\n\r\nToo bad, the house reflected. Too bad I am two miles from the nearest\r\nneighbor. If it were not for that, I could use my amplifiers and call\r\nfor help. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
I do not want them to escape with my owners\' possessions. I\r\ncan repair most of the damage but I could never recover the money and--\r\n\r\nThe man stepped off the small front porch with the jewel box in one\r\nhand, dragging the woman behind him with the other.\r\n\r\nIt was dark outside.\r\n\r\nThat was why he didn\'t notice: The house had risen two hundred feet on\r\nits antigravity rays.\r\n\r\nThe ground below was very hard.\r\n\r\nThe house sang softly and waited for the return of its masters.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
