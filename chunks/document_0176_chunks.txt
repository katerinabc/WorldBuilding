The rocket nozzles were a fused lump of slag; the fire-darkened\r\nhull crumpled and warped by the impact of landing. And there was\r\nsilence ... complete and utter silence.\r\n\r\nThere could be no return. Thurmon realized this. At first the thought\r\nhad brought panic, but, as the scope of his achievement dawned\r\non him, the fear retreated. Bruised, giddy, half-crazed ... the\r\ncertainty of death held no terrors. Not yet. And it was worth it!\r\nFame ... _immortality_! Glory ... in return for the last few years of a\r\nblighted, embittered, over-shadowed life. Yes, it was _well_ worth it.\r\nAnd, except for the crash-landing and the certainty of no return, it\r\nhad all come to pass just as he had planned it for so long.\r\n\r\nOn his knees he caressed the gritty soil. He lifted his arms toward the\r\nDay Star flaming in the day-night of space and knew completion. Tears\r\nstreaked his stubbled face, and strange noises came from his slack\r\nmouth. The ecstasy of success was almost unbearable. For this, he had\r\nlabored a lifetime. For this, he had murdered a friend....\r\n\r\nAcross the abyss, the whole world waited for word. The transmitter\r\nin the rocket had survived the crash. The word would come, thought\r\nThurmon ... when he was ready to send it. And sending it, he would\r\nplace the official seal of immortality on his brow. The book would\r\nclose. But wonderfully, satisfyingly. There would be no other to steal\r\nhis rightful glory. Only Wayne could have done that ... and Wayne was\r\ndead. He laughed weirdly within his helmet. So simply done!\r\n\r\nThe Sea of Serenity stretched out before him in weird magnificence.\r\nIn the far distance a mountain range rose precipitously from the\r\nwilderness of pumice to hump its spiny backbone at the brilliant stars.\r\nA limbo of black shadows and stark white talus slopes. Moonscape!\r\nThurmon stumbled to his feet and fought the wave of nausea that surged\r\nover him as his equilibrium teetered from the low gravity. Then in an\r\ninstant his discomfort was forgotten. Standing on the brink of the\r\ncosmos, his ego drank of grandeur. All the splendor of Creation lay\r\nbefore him like a jeweled carpet. All his! All for John Thurmon,\r\ngenius ... explorer ... murderer! For John Thurmon ... first man on\r\nthe Moon!\r\n\r\nWith an effort he dragged his eyes from the sky. Slowly, his reason\r\nwas returning. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
There was work to do. Wayne must be hidden. The next to\r\ncome must never know. And it should be done quickly. Time would fly and\r\nin the last hours the fear would return. He knew that. Right now his\r\ntriumph sustained him.\r\n\r\nThere was the broadcast to look forward to. A billion people waited for\r\nhis words. It was a sop to his ego, but it could not make him forget\r\nthat this was costing him his life. On occasion, Thurmon could be\r\nrealistic, and he knew that, when there was nothing left to do but sit\r\nand wait for the end, he would be afraid. Terribly, hideously afraid\r\nand alone. It was the only flaw in his plan for immortality. Yet, his\r\nlife had been a barren thing, devoid of love or any real success. It\r\nwas little enough to trade. And this was his only chance for lasting\r\nfame. He could not let it go.\r\n\r\nThe plan was working ... almost of its own inertia. He was alone.\r\nHe was on the Moon, where no man had ever been before him. Not even\r\nWayne. Wayne, who designed the rocket and guided it. Wayne, who had\r\nstolen every chance Thurmon had ever had for recognition! Well, Wayne\r\nwas dead now. He had never put a living foot on the soil of the Moon.\r\nOnly Thurmon had done that. And it was his passport to eternal glory!\r\nNo one, _no one_ could take that away from him! Weighed in the loaded\r\nbalance of his mind, it more than compensated for dying alone and on\r\nan alien world. In fact, even the dying would add to the legends, and\r\nThurmon would live forever. The first man on the Moon!\r\n\r\nHe ran his tongue over dry lips and stooped to pick up the thing at his\r\nfeet. Wayne\'s corpse was still bloated from internal pressures, and the\r\nnaked flesh was drying fast to a parchment-like consistency. Moisture\r\nwas still seeping in awful little globules from the shattered skull\r\nwhere Thurmon\'s unseen blow had landed.\r\n\r\nThurmon found himself shuddering. The murder had been the hardest\r\npart ... but now it was done ... and all that remained was to give his\r\ndead companion a secret resting-place somewhere in the vast expanse of\r\npumice that lay out there under the blistering sun....\r\n\r\nThurmon\'s unsteady mind swerved from high elation to sadness. Poor\r\nWayne! He felt he could afford to be generous now. So many years of\r\nwork so soon to be forgotten. Just one quick blow, and poor, poor Wayne\r\nslipped into the limbo of the Earth\'s forgotten....\r\n\r\nUnder the light gravity, he carried the naked, grisly bundle easily.\r\nAnd, as he walked out into the Mare Tranquilitatis, his spirits rose\r\nagain. How wonderful it was to be certain that no one could steal his\r\ntriumph! Not even Wayne. Particularly not Wayne. He looked down at the\r\nthing in his arms and chuckled. The sound was uncanny within the pyrex\r\nbubble of his helmet.\r\n\r\nAfter what seemed a long time, Thurmon stopped and set down his burden.\r\nWith his pack-spade he set to work digging a trench in the pumice. As\r\nhe dug, he found himself crooning happily to the corpse. His voice was\r\nhigh-pitched and hysterical, but of course he did not notice it.\r\n\r\n"There, there ... Wayne, old friend ... see? I am making a grave for\r\nyou. The very first grave, Wayne ... and you shall have it, old friend!\r\nYours the grave and mine the glory!" He laughed hilariously at the\r\nthought. "I\'ll say you didn\'t make it alive. You didn\'t, did you? But\r\n_I_ made it, Wayne. _Me!_ Alone ... all alone! With no help from you,\r\ndo you hear?"\r\n\r\nThurmon chattered on, the sound of his crazed voice dying within the\r\nconfines of his helmet, while all around him the eternal silence of the\r\nSea of Serenity continued unbroken. The stars shown steadily in the\r\nairless sky, and the sun flamed in impotent splendor, furiously silent.\r\n\r\nAt last the pit was done, and Thurmon lowered the nude corpse into\r\nthe shadows. "Goodbye, Wayne. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
You see, you shouldn\'t have come here\r\nwith me. You shouldn\'t have tried to steal my success. That was a\r\nwrong thing. But you\'re sorry now, aren\'t you, old friend? Don\'t feel\r\ntoo badly, Wayne. I\'ll join you soon. Goodbye, Wayne. Goodbye...."\r\nLaboriously, he shoveled pumice into the pit and tamped it down with\r\nhis leaded boots. Then he smoothed the surface of the dig until it was\r\nas smooth as the rest of the surrounding plain. Satisfied, he turned\r\nhis back on the grave and started for the rocket.\r\n\r\nHe sang on the way back, so happy was he to have done with his ghastly\r\ncompanion. Recklessly prodigal of his oxygen supply, he ran toward the\r\nopen valve of the ship. Breath coming hard, he stumbled into the rocket\r\nand across the buckled deck-plates to the radarphone. The tiny atomic\r\nbatteries hummed as he removed the cadmium dampers. Power flickered the\r\nneedles of the main set. Thurmon adjusted the selector to "relay" and\r\ntuned in his suit radio. Then he returned to sit in the open valve and\r\ncall the monitoring station.\r\n\r\nHe smiled with satisfaction as the response cut through the blanket of\r\nhissing solar static.\r\n\r\n"Hello! Hello, ES-1! 

=== Chunk 4 ===
This is White Sands! My Lord, we\'d given you up\r\nfor lost! 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Where are you?"\r\n\r\nThurmon took a steadier grip on his dancing mind and replied:\r\n\r\n"Listen carefully. Carefully, you understand? This is John Thurmon. I\r\nam on the westernmost edge of the Sea of Serenity on the Moon. Wayne\r\nis dead ... he didn\'t make it. Died during acceleration and I had to\r\ndispose of his body in space. Did you get that? 

=== Chunk 6 ===
I am alone here. The\r\nship crashed on landing. I can\'t get back ... but it\'s worth it! I\r\nhaven\'t much time left ... but I want everyone to know that I made it.\r\nIt will be easier now for others ... after I\'ve pointed the way. I\'m\r\nthe _first_ and it\'s worth it! Did you get that?

=== Chunk 7 ===
"\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence. Finally, the radarman spoke respectfully.\r\n"Yes, Thurmon, we got that. Your transmission is being shunted onto the\r\ncommercial bands. Can you tell us what you see up there? And ... and\r\nThurmon, we all want you to know that our prayers are with you." Tears\r\nwere flowing on Earth now, Thurmon knew. Tears for a martyr to science\r\ndoomed to death alone on an alien world. He smiled thinly. Even this\r\ntiny taste of deference and respect was heady wine to his frustrated\r\npsyche.\r\n\r\nThurmon stepped through the valve and lowered himself to the plain. His\r\nheart was pounding triumphantly. Carefully, painstakingly, he began\r\nto describe his surroundings, interspersing his words with scientific\r\ndata. He played the hero well. There was no hysteria recognizable in\r\nhis voice ... and, if it trembled slightly, there was reason enough for\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nHe rounded the bulge of the rocket\'s nose and looked for the first\r\ntime at the western edge of the Mare. In the near distance an\r\nirregularly-shaped outcropping of rock caught his eye. Transmitting as\r\nhe went, he made his way toward it.... He drew nearer. And as he did,\r\nfear began to stir within him. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
His steps faltered, but some awful\r\npower drew him on. His voice became a shrill rasp in his ears, and on\r\nEarth a billion people gasped with horror....\r\n\r\n"_Wayne!_"\r\n\r\nThurmon shouted the name in fear and threw his arm over his face. But\r\nthe thing remained. It was _real_!\r\n\r\n"_Wayne ... no!_ IT CAN\'T BE! NO...."\r\n\r\nBut the figure did not move. The vast colossus loomed stark white and\r\nnaked in the brilliant sunlight. Legs apart, arms folded on its breast,\r\nit stared with brooding eyes at the vast emptiness of the lunar plain.\r\n\r\nThurmon howled with terror and fury.\r\n\r\n"Damn you! _Damn you!_ Why don\'t you answer me? I killed you once ...\r\nI\'ll kill you again! I\'m the first one here! Do you hear me? I\'ll kill\r\nyou again!"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "_Why don\'t you answer me? 

=== Chunk 9 ===
I killed you once!_"]\r\n\r\nHe lowered his head and charged. The last thing he remembered was the\r\nsoundless tinkle of his shattering helmet, and the terrible pain as his\r\nskull cracked under the suddenly shifting pressures....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"... _And strangely enough, the story of the race\'s first conquest\r\nof space is the story of one man, Sargon, the Lemurian Immortal, who\r\nled his people to the Moon in the misty past of Earth\'s youth. The\r\nLemurians are gone now, but on the westernmost edge of the Sea of\r\nSerenity there stands a statue of Sargon. It stands in magnificent\r\nisolation, a monument to the first man on the Moon._"\r\n\r\n                     Essays on Tellurian History,\r\n                      Quintus Bland, Geneva Keep\r\n                           Press, 12.50 Cr.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
