Idle\r\n             talk now, but it was ghastly reality to Kent!\r\n\r\n\r\nHoward Kent looked at his young and beautiful wife and felt the weight\r\nof the years rest on his shoulders. In her eyes he saw his heavily\r\nlined face and sagging, stooped shoulders.\r\n\r\nThey stood just inside the long, narrow reception room of the Human\r\nRejuvenation Plant. Potted palms and formal chairs reminded one of a\r\nHuman Disposal unit.\r\n\r\n"I have a confession to make, darling," he said.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, Howard. Not now. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
I take for granted you\'ve done the usual\r\nthings in your youth."\r\n\r\n"But...."\r\n\r\n"And we needn\'t have hurried so, as you can see. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Now we\'ll probably\r\nhave to wait hours in this perfectly dismal place."\r\n\r\nShe looked as young and fresh as he looked old and dusty, he thought,\r\nso out of place in this kind of establishment.\r\n\r\nHe had always loved small women. Leah was small and vivacious and\r\ndressed a year ahead of styles. No matter what happened, he\'d never\r\nregret having married her.\r\n\r\n"But this is something I should have told you before," he said.\r\n\r\nShe put her hand on his arm. "I\'ve been perfectly happy these past six\r\nmonths. Whatever it was, I forgive you."\r\n\r\n"It\'s not that. I\'m talking about my age. I didn\'t think you\'d marry\r\nme if you knew how old I really was. I put off telling you and figured\r\nyou\'d see my birth certificate at the wedding ceremony."\r\n\r\n"I never even looked at the silly old thing."\r\n\r\n"Well, darling, I looked at yours and felt a little guilty in marrying\r\na young girl of twenty-three. But the fact is I\'m sixty-five. I\'ve been\r\nrejuvenated before."\r\n\r\n"I rather suspected it when you started aging so suddenly last week,"\r\nshe said. "Before that you didn\'t look a day over thirty. But it\r\ndoesn\'t matter."\r\n\r\n"It\'s worse than that, Leah." His face worked convulsively. "I\'ve been\r\nhere twice before. This is my third trip."\r\n\r\n"I\'m too modern to act shocked, Howard. If you didn\'t want to tell me\r\nbefore, dear, it\'s perfectly all right."\r\n\r\n"Look, darling!" Perspiration stood on his forehead. "You don\'t seem\r\nto understand. But then you never could add or subtract. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Now listen\r\ncarefully. Each trip clips five years off your life span."\r\n\r\n"Everyone knows that, of course. But it\'s better to be young...."\r\n\r\n"It\'s better to be alive than dead," he said harshly.\r\n\r\n"But your doctors have given you a longevity span to the age of\r\nninety."\r\n\r\n"Suppose it was eighty, instead of ninety?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear, you worry too much," she said. "Doctors don\'t make such\r\nmistakes."\r\n\r\n"They can\'t give me a guarantee. You see, three of my ancestors\r\ndied from accidents. The prediction of ninety years is based on the\r\nassumption that they would have lived a normal life-time."\r\n\r\n"They make few guarantees. You know, all of you men are such babies at\r\na time like this."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but if it _is_ eighty--then, I\'ll come out not a rejuvenated man,\r\nbut just a handful of dust."\r\n\r\n"Oh, that can\'t happen."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Look at it this way." He paused a moment while taking in her youthful\r\nappearance. "From now on I wouldn\'t look much older. Just a little\r\ngrayer and perhaps more stooped. Then, I\'ll have what\'s left of my\r\nlongevity plus the five years this rejuvenation would clip off."\r\n\r\n"Why, Howard, dear." Leah sounded shocked. "You don\'t know what you\'re\r\ntalking about. An aunt of mine elected that choice and it was perfectly\r\nhorrible. She drooled the last few years of her life and was helpless\r\nas a baby."\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t they use Euthanasia?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"The courts decided she wasn\'t capable of making a rational decision."\r\n\r\nHe wiped his forehead. "That would be a long time off, darling. We\'d\r\nhave so much time together in the next fifteen years."\r\n\r\n"But what would it be like if you were crippled with arthritis or some\r\nother disease?"\r\n\r\n"You could divorce me if that happens."\r\n\r\n"I can also divorce you if you don\'t go through with rejuvenation. You\r\nknow it\'s the law."\r\n\r\n"You wouldn\'t do that." His face was more lined than ever.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be silly, dear. Nobody gets old these days. Who would remain our\r\nfriends? Why, everywhere we\'d go, people would point us out. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Oh, no,\r\nlife wouldn\'t be livable."\r\n\r\n"That sounds like a cruel and calculating decision to me," Howard said.\r\n"Either I take a chance on dying or you\'ll divorce me."\r\n\r\n"You have no right to make such an accusation. I married a young man\r\nwho said he was thirty years old. Six months later I discover he\'s\r\nsixty-five. Now who\'s cruel and calculating?"\r\n\r\n"Please, darling, I didn\'t mean it. Look," he pleaded, "I\'ll even sign\r\npermission for you to have a lover. There\'s that young fellow that\'s\r\nalways around. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Maybe it\'s happened already."\r\n\r\nShe stood back from him. "Howard, you\'re being perfectly nasty. Just\r\nlike an aged person you read about."\r\n\r\n"Five million dollars, and all of it yours when I die a natural death."\r\nHe put his hands in his pockets.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe street door opened just then and a young man came toward them with\r\na light springy step.\r\n\r\nHe offered his hand to Howard who took it slowly. "How are you,\r\nskipper? 

=== Chunk 7 ===
And you, Leah? I came as soon as I got your message."\r\n\r\n"He\'s worried, Mike." Leah\'s face had brightened. "And now he\'s\r\ninsisting on growing old."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been through the wringer twice before, you see," Howard said in a\r\nlow voice.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think you have much to worry about," Mike said. "Those medics\r\nknow their business."\r\n\r\n"Aging is a nasty process." Leah wrinkled her nose as if she smelled\r\nsomething offensive. "Maybe you can convince him, Mike."\r\n\r\n"Leah is right, you know," Mike said. "A few years ago I visited the\r\nold age home. There\'s only one left. You\'d be surprised at the amount\r\nof suffering old people go through before they die; cancer, angina,\r\nbroken bones, strokes, arthritis. Rejuvenation won\'t work on extremely\r\nold bodies. Longevity has run out."\r\n\r\n"Why does it have to clip off five years?" worried Howard.\r\n\r\n"It\'s the old-age governor they found in the pituitary gland. They can\r\nturn it back, but the shock takes off about five years."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I know what\'s in the medical articles," Howard growled. "Remember,\r\nI\'ve been through here twice before. But the Sun was so warm this\r\nmorning. It was like seeing everything for the last time. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
I felt like\r\nsitting down and letting everything drift."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a sure sign that you really need rejuvenating," said Leah.\r\n"After it\'s over you\'ll be making me a golf widow again. Won\'t he,\r\nMike?

=== Chunk 9 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Of course. He\'ll come out raring to go."\r\n\r\nHoward looked from Mike to Leah and back at Mike. Age was no match for\r\nyouth. If love hadn\'t started between them already, it would soon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the end of the long room, a door opened and two nurses entered,\r\nstarched and antiseptic.\r\n\r\n"Your room is ready, Mr. Kent," one nurse said.\r\n\r\nHoward shuddered. "Everything is so horribly familiar. The pill to\r\nerase the worry, which doesn\'t work. The cart you ride on which makes\r\nyou feel like a carcass. The little bump as you enter the regeneration\r\nroom. Then you get a hypodermic and crawl into a long boiler tank."\r\n\r\n"You\'re just nervous, dear," said Leah.\r\n\r\n"A dismal, miasmic cloud settles on your mind and you decide you\r\nwouldn\'t go through it again for anything in the world."\r\n\r\nMike put his arm around Leah as if it were the most natural thing in\r\nthe world. "He\'ll be all right, my darling."\r\n\r\nHoward looked at them and then turned wearily to the nurse. "I\'m ready."\r\n\r\nThe nurse walked down the long room with the stooped man and\r\ndisappeared beyond the door.\r\n\r\n"Did you tell him about us?" asked Mike.\r\n\r\n"Of course not. What a man doesn\'t know won\'t hurt him."\r\n\r\n"Are you Mrs. Kent?" asked the other nurse who had remained behind.\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"The doctor said to remind you that the fourth time is very dangerous,"\r\nthe nurse said. "You\'ll have five years and six months without it. But\r\npossibly only six months if it should be successful."\r\n\r\n"Better take the first offer, Leah," said Mike.\r\n\r\nLeah smiled. "I found a gray hair and a wrinkle this morning, love.\r\nBetter six months of youth than a thousand years of old age."\r\n\r\nShe went into his arms. "Don\'t worry about what happens, love. You\'ll\r\nhave a lot of fun in the next seventy years."\r\n\r\nHe kissed her and held her closely.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got to go now," she said. "I\'m so grateful you were able to get\r\nthe forged birth certificate."\r\n\r\nHer high heels tapped rapidly on the tile floor as she walked down the\r\nlong room with the other nurse.\r\n\r\n"Good luck, Mother," he called after her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
