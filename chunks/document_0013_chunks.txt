Ackerman, prominent Los Angeles agent and Science\r\n    Fiction enthusiast, reports on the recent World Convention in New\r\n    York. Mr. Ackerman, who attended the first World Convention\r\n    seventeen years ago, has been prominent in SF circles since the\r\n    early thirties._\r\n\r\n\r\n        out\r\n         of\r\n       this\r\n      world\r\n convention\r\n\r\n _by FORREST J. ACKERMAN_\r\n\r\n\r\n An eye-witness account of the 14th World\r\n Science Fiction Convention in session.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was a spy for the FBI--the Fantasy Bureau of Investigation! Learning\r\nof a monster meeting of science fiction "fen" in New York, I teleported\r\nmyself 3,000 miles from the Pacificoast to check the facts on the\r\nmonsters. And it was true--the 14th World SciFi Con was tremonstrous.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn all seriousness, the _Newyorcon_ was one of the greatest aggregations\r\nof s.f. enthusiasts I have ever seen. A far cry from the _Nycon_, the\r\n_first_ "world" s.f. con of 17 years before, when the turnout of 125 was\r\nconsidered colossal. Now more than twelve hundred fans, authors,\r\neditors, artists, publishers, agents, anthologists, reviewers and\r\nreaders of science fiction and fantasy registered for the Labor Day\r\nWeekend gathering of the clans, a conclave of the slans.\r\n\r\nFrom 37 of the 48 states they came. And from Canada, Cuba, England,\r\nGermany, India, Israel and the West Indies.

The roll call of celebrities\r\nread like the Who\'s Who of S.F. Prodom: Theodore Sturgeon, Isaac Asimov,\r\nFritz Leiber, Willy Ley, Nelson Bond, John W. Campbell Jr., L. Sprague\r\nde Camp, James Blish, Judith Merril, "Ted" Carnell (Editor of New\r\nWorlds), Kelly Freas, Edmond Hamilton, Leigh Brackett, Anthony Boucher,\r\nWilliam Tenn, James E. Gunn, Frank Belknap Long Jr., and numerous\r\nothers, including Guest of Honor Arthur C. Clarke.\r\n\r\nA standing ovation was given Arthur Clarke before and after his speech\r\nat the Banquet, a serious address that lasted forty-five minutes and\r\ncovered many philosophical facets of the s.f. field. Especially rousing\r\nhands were given two of the real old-timers present, artist Frank R.\r\nPaul (Guest of Honor of the first Convention), and--out of the Ark--the\r\nman who once was an assistant to Thomas Alva Edison, the pioneer\r\nnovelist of scientific romances and the man who discovered the Golden\r\nAtom--Ray Cummings. World famous cartoonist Al Capp gave a hilarious\r\nspeech at the Banquet Sunday night, other large laughs being garnered on\r\nthe occasion by Isaac Asimov and Anthony Boucher, Robert Bloch again\r\nproving that he has no peer as a Master of Ceremonies.\r\n\r\nThe Masquerade Ball was filmed for televising, and was a sight for\r\nbugging eyes. Extraterrestrial glamour girls came in spectrumatic\r\ncolors: one, Ruth Landis of Venus (formerly Nuyok), was a verdant\r\nbeauty, fresh as a breath of chlorophyll; while tall Tam Otteson, a\r\nrecent import from England, had the judges agreeing that just looking at\r\nher was an education. Olga Ley won for the Most Beautiful costume, and\r\nJos Christoff--a survivor from the first convention of them all--was\r\nanother prize winner. Monsters, mutants, scientists, spacemen, aliens,\r\nand assorted "Things" thronged the ballroom floor as the flashbulbs\r\npopped.\r\n\r\nJohn Campbell lectured on and demonstrated his controversial psionic\r\nHieronymus machine, and famous fans sprang from der vood-work out--Sam\r\nMoskowitz, James Taurasi, Bob Tucker, Julius Unger, Raymond Van Houten,\r\nAllen Glasser ...\r\n\r\nDavid Kyle, E. E. Evans, James Taurasi, myself and 2 others were elected\r\nDirectors of the World Science Fiction Society.\r\n\r\nNo account of the Newyorcon could be complete without a deep bow of\r\nappreciation to the altruistic trio of committeemen (including one\r\ncomely woman) who all but destroyed themselves engineering the\r\nConvention: David A. Kyle, Ruth Landis and Dick Ellington.\r\n\r\nBy a vote of 3 to 1, London was selected as the site of the 15th Con, to\r\nbe held in \'57. For an unforgettable experience in the fantastic\r\nuniverse of science fiction enthusiasts, plan _now_ to attend the\r\nLONCON!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ January 1957.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.
