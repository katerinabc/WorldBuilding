=== Chunk 2 ===
That had been the last wish of each as he had\r\npassed away, dying from sheer old age. True they had fought on as long\r\nas they could to save their kind from utter extinction but the comet\r\nthat had trailed its poisoning wake across space to leave behind it,\r\nupon Earth, a noxious, lethal gas vapor, had done its work too well."\r\n\r\nNo living soul breathed upon the Earth. No one lived here now, but Kiron\r\nand his kind.\r\n\r\n"And," so thought Kiron to himself, "he might as well be a great\r\nunthinking robot able to do only one thing instead of the mental giant\r\nhe was, so obsessed had he become with the task he had set himself to\r\ndo."\r\n\r\nYet, in spite of a great loneliness and a strong fear of a final\r\nfrustration, he worked on with the others of his people, hardly stopping\r\nfor anything except the very necessities needed to keep his big body\r\nworking in perfect coordination.\r\n\r\nTirelessly he worked, for The Masters had bred, if that is the word to\r\nuse, fatigue and the need for restoration out of his race long decades\r\nago.\r\n\r\nSometimes, though, he would stop his work when the great red dying sun\r\nbegan to fade into the west and his round eyes would grow wistful as he\r\nlooked out over the great city that stretched in towering minarets and\r\nlofty spires of purest crystal blue for miles on every side. A fairy\r\ncity of rarest hue and beauty. A city for the Gods and the Gods were\r\ndead. Kiron felt, at such times, the great loneliness that the last\r\nMaster must have known.\r\n\r\nThey had been kind, The Masters, and Kiron knew that his people, as they\r\nwent about their eternal tasks of keeping the great city in perfect\r\nshape for The Masters who no longer needed it, must miss them as he did.\r\n\r\nNever to hear their voices ringing, never to see them again gathered in\r\ngroups to witness some game or to play amid the silver fountains and\r\nflowery gardens of the wondrous city, made him infinitely saddened. It\r\nwould always be like this, unless....\r\n\r\nBut thinking, dreaming, reminiscing would not bring it all back for\r\nthere was only one answer to still the longing: work. The others worked\r\nand did not dream, but instead kept busy tending to the thousand and one\r\ntasks The Masters had set them to do--had left them doing when the last\r\nMaster perished. He too must remember the trust they had placed in his\r\nhands and fulfill it as best he could.\r\n\r\nFrom the time the great red eye of the sun opened itself in the East\r\nuntil it disappeared in the blue haze beyond the crysolite city, Kiron\r\nlabored with his fellows. Then, at the appointed hour, the musical\r\nsignals would peal forth their sweet, sad chimes, whispering goodnight\r\nto ears that would hear them no more and all operations would halt for\r\nthe night, just as it had done when The Masters were here to supervise\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThen when morning came he would start once more trying, testing,\r\nexperimenting with his chemicals and plastics, forever following\r\nlabyrinth of knowledge, seeking for the great triumph that would make\r\nthe work of the others of some real use.\r\n\r\nHis hands molded the materials carefully, lovingly to a pattern that was\r\nset in his mind as a thing to cherish. Day by day his experiments in\r\ntheir liquid baths took form under his careful modeling. He mixed his\r\nchemicals with the same loving touch, the same careful concentration and\r\npainstaking thoroughness, studying often his notes and analysis charts.\r\n\r\nEverything must be just so lest his experiment not turn out perfectly.\r\nHe never became exasperated at a failure or a defect that proved to be\r\nthe only reward for his faithful endeavors but worked patiently on\r\ntoward a goal that he knew would ultimately be his.\r\n\r\nThen one day, as the great red sun glowed like an immense red eye\r\noverhead, Kiron stepped back to admire his handiwork. In that instant\r\nthe entire wondrous city seemed to breathe a silent prayer as he stood\r\ntransfixed by the sight before him.

Then it went on as usual, hurrying\r\nnoiselessly about its business. The surface cars, empty though they\r\nwere, fled swiftly about supported only by the rings of magnetic force\r\nthat held them to their designated paths. The gravoships raised from the\r\ntower-dromes to speed silently into the eye of the red sun that was\r\ndying.\r\n\r\n"No one now," Kiron thought to himself as he studied his handiwork. Then\r\nhe walked unhurriedly to the cabinet in the laboratory corner and took\r\nfrom it a pair of earphones resembling those of a long forgotten radio\r\nset. Just as unhurriedly, though his mind was filled with turmoil and\r\nhis being with excitement, he walked back and connected the earphones to\r\nthe box upon his bench. The phones dangled into the liquid bath before\r\nhim as he adjusted them to suit his requirements.\r\n\r\nSlowly he checked over every step of his experiments before he went\r\nfarther. Then, as he proved them for the last time, his hand went slowly\r\nto the small knife switch upon the box at his elbow. Next he threw into\r\nconnection the larger switch upon his laboratory wall bringing into his\r\nlaboratory the broadcast power of the crysolite city.\r\n\r\nThe laboratory generators hummed softly, drowning out the quiet hum of\r\nthe city outside. As they built up, sending tiny living electrical\r\nimpulses over the wires like minute currents that come from the brain,\r\nKiron sat breathless; his eyes intent.\r\n\r\nCloser to his work he bent, watching lovingly, fearful least all might\r\nnot be quite right. Then his eyes took on a brighter light as he began\r\nto see the reaction. He knew the messages that he had sent out were\r\nbeing received and coordinated into a unit that would stir and grow into\r\nintellect.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the machine flashed its little warning red light and\r\nautomatically snapped off. Kiron twisted quickly in his seat and threw\r\nhome the final switch. This, he knew, was the ultimate test. On the\r\nresults of the flood of energy impulses that he had set in motion rested\r\nthe fulfillment of his success--_or failure_.\r\n\r\nHe watched with slight misgivings. This had never been accomplished\r\nbefore. How could it possibly be a success now? Even The Masters had\r\nnever quite succeeded at this final test, how could he, only a servant?\r\nYet it must work for he had no desire in life but to make it work.\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, he was on his feet, eyes wide. From the two long,\r\ncoffin-like liquid baths, there arose two perfect specimens of the _Homo\r\nsapiens_. Man and woman, they were, and they blinked their eyes in the\r\nlight of the noonday sun, raised themselves dripping from the baths of\r\ntheir creation and stepped to the floor before Kiron.\r\n\r\nThe man spoke, the woman remained silent.\r\n\r\n"I am Adam Two," he said. "Created, by you Kiron from a formula they\r\nleft, in their image. I was created to be a Master and she whom you also\r\nhave created is to be my wife. We shall mate and the race of Man shall\r\nbe reborn through us and others whom I shall help you create."\r\n\r\nThe Man halted at the last declaration he intoned and walked smilingly\r\ntoward the woman who stepped into his open arms returning his smile.\r\n\r\nKiron smiled too within his pumping heart. The words the Man had intoned\r\nhad been placed in his still pregnable mind by the tele-teach phones and\r\nrecord that the last Master had prepared before death had halted his\r\nexperiments. The actions of the Man toward the Woman, Kiron knew, was\r\ncaused by the natural constituents that went to form his chemical body\r\nand govern his humanness.\r\n\r\nHe, Kiron, had created a living man and woman. The Masters lived again\r\nbecause of him. They would sing and play and again people the\r\nmagnificent crysolite city because he loved them and had kept on until\r\nsuccess had been his. But then why not such a turnabout? Hadn\'t they,\r\nThe Masters, created him a superb, thinking _robot_?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\nThis etext was produced from _Comet_ July 1941.
