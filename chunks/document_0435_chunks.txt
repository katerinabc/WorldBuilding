After all his wire-pulling to get\r\ninto the First Group, and his slaving to make a farm on this alien\r\nplanet, dead in bed!\r\n\r\nNaomi\'s mind circled frantically, contrasting her happy anticipations\r\nwith this shocking actuality. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
She\'d come to call on a friend, she\r\nreminded herself, a beloved friend--round, white-haired, rosy-cheeked;\r\nlonely because he\'d recently become a widower. To her little boy, Cappy\r\nwas a combination Grandpa and Santa Claus; to herself, a sort of newly\r\nmet Old Beau.\r\n\r\nHer mouth had been set for a sip of his home brew, her eyes had pictured\r\nthe delight he\'d take in and give to her little boy.\r\n\r\nShe\'d walked over with son and husband, expecting nothing more shocking\r\nthan an ostentatiously stolen kiss. She\'d found a corpse. And to have\r\nlet Cappy die alone, in this strange world ...\r\n\r\nShe and Ted could at least have been with him, if they\'d known.\r\n\r\nBut they\'d been laughing and singing in their own cabin only a mile\r\naway, celebrating Richard\'s fifth birthday. She\'d been annoyed when\r\nCappy failed to show up with the present he\'d promised Richard.\r\nAnnoyed--while the old man pulled a blanket over his head, turned his\r\nround face to the wall, and died.\r\n\r\nWatching compassionately, Naomi was suddenly struck by the\r\nmatter-of-fact way Ted examined the body. Ted wasn\'t surprised.\r\n\r\n"Why did you tell Richard to stay outside, just now?" she demanded. "How\r\ndid you know what we\'d find here? And why didn\'t you tell me, so I could\r\nkeep Richard at home?"\r\n\r\nShe saw Ted start, scalded by the splash of her self-directed anger, saw\r\nhim try to convert his wince into a shrug.\r\n\r\n"You insisted on coming," he reminded her gently. "I couldn\'t have kept\r\nyou home without--without saying too much, worrying you--with the\r\nEarth-ship still a year away. Besides, I didn\'t know for sure, till we\r\nsaw the tree-things around the cabin."\r\n\r\nThe tree-things. The trees-that-were-not. Gnarled blue trunks,\r\nhalf-hidden by yellow leaf-needles stretching twenty feet into the sky.\r\nSomething like the hoary mountain hemlocks she and Ted had been forever\r\nphotographing on their Sierra honeymoon, seven life-long years ago.\r\n\r\nThree of those tree-things had swayed over Cappy\'s spring for a far\r\nlonger time than Man had occupied this dreadful planet. Until just\r\nnow ...\r\n\r\nThe three of them had topped the rise that hid Cappy\'s farm from their\r\nown. Richard was running ahead like a happily inquisitive puppy.\r\nSuddenly he\'d stopped, pointing with a finger she distinctly recalled as\r\nneeding thorough soapy scrubbing.\r\n\r\n"Look, Mommie!" he\'d said. "Cappy\'s trees have moved. They\'re around the\r\ncabin, now.

=== Chunk 3 ===
"\r\n\r\nHe\'d been interested, not surprised. In the past year, Mazda had become\r\nRichard\'s home; only Earth could surprise him.\r\n\r\nBut, Ted, come to think of it, had seemed withdrawn, his face a careful\r\nblank. And she?\r\n\r\n"Very pretty," she\'d said, and stuffed the tag-end of fear back into the\r\njammed, untidy mental pigeon-hole she used for all unpleasant thoughts.\r\n"Don\'t run too far ahead, dear."\r\n\r\nBut now she had to know what Ted knew.\r\n\r\n"Tell me!" she said.\r\n\r\n"These tree-things--"\r\n\r\n"There\'ve been _other_ deaths! How many?"\r\n\r\n"Sixteen. But I didn\'t want to tell you. Orders were to leave women and\r\nchildren home when we had that last Meeting, remember."\r\n\r\n"What did they say at the Meeting? Out with it, Ted!"\r\n\r\n"That--that the tree-things think!"\r\n\r\n"But that\'s ridiculous!"\r\n\r\n"Well, unfortunately, no. Look, I\'m not trying to tell you that\r\nterrestrial trees think, too, nor even that they have a nervous system.\r\nThey don\'t. But--well, on Earth, if you\'ve ever touched a lighted match\r\nto the leaf of a sensitive plant like the mimosa, say--and I\r\nhave--you\'ve been struck by the speed with which _other_ leaves close up\r\nand droop. I mean, sure, we know that the leaves droop because certain\r\ncells exude water and nearby leaves feel the heat of the match. But the\r\nothers don\'t, yet they droop, too. Nobody knows how it works ..."\r\n\r\n"But _that\'s_ just defensive!"\r\n\r\n"Sure. But _that\'s_ just on Earth!"\r\n\r\n"All right, dear. I won\'t argue any more. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
But I still don\'t understand.\r\nGo on about the Meeting."\r\n\r\n"Well, they said these tree-things both create and respond to the\r\npatterned electrical impulses of the mind. It\'s something like the way a\r\ndoctor creates fantasies by applying a mild electric current to the\r\nright places on a patient\'s brain. In the year we\'ve been here, the\r\ntrees--or some of them--have learned to read from and transmit to our\r\nminds. The range, they say, is around fifty feet. But you have to be\r\nreceptive--"\r\n\r\n"Receptive?"\r\n\r\n"Fearful. That\'s the condition. So I didn\'t want to tell you because you\r\n_must not_ let yourself become afraid, Naomi. We\'re clearing trees from\r\nthe land, in certain areas. And it\'s their planet, after all. Fear is\r\ntheir weapon and fear can kill!"\r\n\r\n"You still--all you men--should have let us women know! What do you\r\nthink we are? 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Besides, I don\'t really believe you. How can fear kill?"\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t you ever heard of a savage who gets in bad with his\r\nwitch-doctor and is killed by magic? The savage is convinced, having\r\nseen or heard of other cases, that he _can_ be killed. The witch-doctor\r\nsees to it he\'s told he _will_ be killed. And sometimes the savage\r\nactually dies--"\r\n\r\n"From poison, I\'ve always thought."\r\n\r\n"The poison of fear. The physical changes that accompany fear, magnified\r\nbeyond belief by belief itself."\r\n\r\n"But how in the world could all this have affected Cappy? He wasn\'t a\r\nsavage. And he was elderly, Ted. A bad heart, maybe. A stroke.\r\nAnything."\r\n\r\n"He passed his pre-flight physical only a year ago. And--well, he lived\r\nall alone. He was careful not to let you see it, but I know he worried\r\nabout these three trees on his place. And I know he got back from the\r\nMeeting in a worried state of mind. Then, obviously, the trees\r\nmoved--grouped themselves around his cabin within easy range. But don\'t\r\nbe afraid of them, Naomi. So long as you\'re not, they can\'t hurt you.\r\nThey\'re not bothering us now."\r\n\r\n"No. But where\'s Richard?"\r\n\r\nNaomi\'s eyes swept past Ted, encompassing the cabin. No Richard! He\'d\r\nbeen left outside ...\r\n\r\nGlass tinkled and crashed as she flung back the cabin door. "Richard!\r\nRichard!"\r\n\r\nHer child was not in sight. Nor within earshot, it seemed.\r\n\r\n"Richard Heckscher! Where are you?" 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Sanity returned with the\r\nconventional primness. And it brought her answer.\r\n\r\n"Here I am, Mommie! Look-at!

=== Chunk 7 ===
"\r\n\r\nHe was in a tree! He was fifteen feet off the ground, high in the\r\nbranches of a tree-thing, swaying--\r\n\r\nFor an instant, dread flowed through Naomi as if in her bloodstream and\r\nsomething was cutting off her breath. Then, as the hands over mouth and\r\nthroat withdrew, she saw they were Ted\'s. She let him drag her into the\r\ncabin and close the broken door.\r\n\r\n"Better not scare Richard," he said quietly, shoving her gently into a\r\nchair. "He might fall."\r\n\r\nDumbly she caught her breath, waiting for the bawling out she\'d earned.\r\n\r\nBut Ted said, "Richard keeps us safe. So long as we fear for him, and\r\nnot ourselves--"\r\n\r\nThat was easy to do. Outside, she heard a piping call: "Look at me now,\r\nMommie!"\r\n\r\n"Showing off!" 

=== Chunk 8 ===
she gasped. In a flashing vision, Richard was half boy,\r\nhalf vulture, flapping to the ground with a broken wing.\r\n\r\n"Here," said Ted, picking up a notebook that had been on the table.\r\n"Here\'s Cappy\'s present. A homemade picture book. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
Bait."\r\n\r\n"Let _me_ use it!" she said. "Richard may have seen I was scared just\r\nnow."\r\n\r\nOutside again, under the tree, she called, "Here\'s Cappy\'s present,\r\nRichard. He\'s gone away and left it for you."\r\n\r\nWould he notice how her voice had gone up half an octave, become flat\r\nand shrill?\r\n\r\n"I\'m coming down," Richard said. "Let me down, tree."\r\n\r\nHe seemed to be struggling. The branches were cagelike. He was caught!\r\n\r\nNaomi\'s struggle was with her voice. "How did you _ever_ get up there?"\r\nshe called.\r\n\r\n"The tree let me up, Mommie," Richard explained solemnly, "but he won\'t\r\nlet me down!" He whimpered a little.\r\n\r\nHe must _not_ become frightened! "You tell that tree you\'ve got to come\r\nright down this instant!" she ordered.\r\n\r\nShe leaned against the cabin for support. Ted came out and slipped his\r\narm around her.\r\n\r\n"Break off a few leaves, Richard," he suggested. "That\'ll show your tree\r\nwho\'s boss!"\r\n\r\nStanding close against her husband, Naomi tried to stop shaking. But she\r\nlacked firm support, for Ted shook, too.\r\n\r\nHis advice to Richard was sound, though. What had been a trap became,\r\nthrough grudging movement of the branches, a ladder. Richard climbed\r\ndown, scolding at the tree like an angry squirrel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNaomi thought she\'d succeeded in shutting her mind. But when her little\r\nboy slid down the final bit of trunk and came for his present, Naomi\r\nbroke. Like a startled animal, she thrust the book into his hands,\r\npicked him up and ran. Her mind was a jelly, red and quaking.\r\n\r\nShe stopped momentarily after running fifty yards. "Burn the trees!" she\r\nscreamed over her shoulder. "Burn the cabin! Burn it all!" She ran on,\r\nTed\'s answering shouts beyond her comprehension.\r\n\r\nFatigue halted her. At the top of the rise between Cappy\'s farm and\r\ntheir own, pain and dizziness began flowing over her in waves. She set\r\nRichard down on the mauve soil and collapsed beside him.\r\n\r\nWhen she sat up, Richard squatted just out of reach, watching curiously.\r\nShe made an effort at casualness: "Let\'s see what Daddy\'s doing back\r\nthere."\r\n\r\n"He\'s doing just what you said to, Mommie!" Richard answered\r\nindignantly.\r\n\r\nHer men were standing together, Naomi realized. She laughed. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
After a\r\nmoment, Richard joined her. Then he looked for his book, found it a few\r\npaces away, and brought it to her.\r\n\r\n"Read to me, Mommie."\r\n\r\n"At home," she said.\r\n\r\nActivity at Cappy\'s interested her now. Wisps of smoke were licking\r\naround the trees. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
A tongue of flame lapped at one while she watched.\r\nBranches writhed. The trees were too slow-moving to escape ...\r\n\r\nBut where was Ted? What had she exposed him to, with her hysterical\r\norders? She held her breath till he moved within sight, standing quietly\r\nby a pile of salvaged tools. Behind him the cabin began to smoke.\r\n\r\nTed wasn\'t afraid, then. He understood what he faced. And Richard wasn\'t\r\nafraid, either, because he didn\'t understand.\r\n\r\nBut she? Surreptitiously Naomi pinched her hip till it felt black and\r\nblue. That was for being such a fool. She must _not_ be afraid!\r\n\r\n"Daddy seems to be staying there," she said. "Let\'s wait for him at\r\nhome, Richard."\r\n\r\n"Are you going to make Daddy burn _our_ tree?"\r\n\r\nShe jumped as if stung. Then, consciously womanlike, she sought relief\r\nin talk.\r\n\r\n"What do _you_ think we should do, dear?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I _like_ the tree, Mommie. It\'s cool under there. And the tree\r\nplays with me."\r\n\r\n"How, Richard?"\r\n\r\n"If I\'m pilot, he\'s navigator. Or ship, maybe. But he\'s so dumb, Mommie!\r\nI always have to tell him everything. Doesn\'t know what a fairy is, or\r\nGoldilocks, or anything!"\r\n\r\nHe clutched his book affectionately, rubbing his face on it. "Hurry up,\r\nMommie. It\'ll be bedtime before you ever read to me!"\r\n\r\nShe touched his head briefly. 

=== Chunk 12 ===
"You can look at the book while I fix your\r\nsupper."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut to explain Cappy\'s pictures--crudely crayoned cartoons, really--she\r\nhad to fill in the story they illustrated. She told it while Richard\r\nate: how the intrepid Spaceman gallantly used his ray gun against the\r\nvillainous Martians to aid the green-haired Princess. Richard spooned up\r\nthe thrills with his mush, gazing fascinated at Cappy\'s colorful and\r\nfantastic pictures, propped before him on the table. Had Ted been home,\r\nthe scene might almost have been blissful.\r\n\r\nIt might have been ... if their own tree hadn\'t reminded her of\r\nCappy\'s. Still, she\'d almost managed to stuff her fear back into that\r\nmental pigeon-hole before their own tree. It was unbelievable, but she\'d\r\nbeen glancing out the window every few minutes, so she saw it start.\r\nTheir own tree began to walk.\r\n\r\nDown the hill it came--right there!--framed in the window behind\r\nRichard\'s head, moving slowly but inexorably on a root system that\r\nwrithed along the surface. Like some ancient sculpture of Serpents\r\nSupporting the Tree of Life. Except that it brought death ...\r\n\r\n"Are you sick, Mommie?"\r\n\r\nNo, not sick. Just something the matter with her throat, preventing a\r\nquick answer, leaving no way to keep Richard from turning to look out\r\nthe window.\r\n\r\n"I think our tree is coming to play with me, Mommie."\r\n\r\nNo, no! Not Richard!\r\n\r\n"Remember how you used to say that about Cappy? When he was really\r\ncoming to see your daddy?"\r\n\r\n"But Daddy isn\'t home!"\r\n\r\n"He\'ll get here, dear. Now eat your supper."\r\n\r\nA lot to ask of an excited little boy. And the tree _was_ his friend, it\r\nseemed. Cappy\'s tree had even followed the child\'s orders. Richard might\r\nintercede--\r\n\r\nNo! Expose him to such danger? How could she think of it?\r\n\r\n"Had enough to eat, dear? Wash your hands and face at the pump, and you\r\ncan stay out and play till Daddy gets home. I--I want----I may have to\r\nsee your friend, the tree, by myself ..."\r\n\r\n"But you haven\'t finished my story!"\r\n\r\n"I will when Daddy gets home. And if I\'m not here, you tell Daddy to do\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Where are you going, Mommie?"\r\n\r\n"I might see Cappy, dear. Now go and wash, please!"\r\n\r\n"Sure, Mommie. Don\'t cry."\r\n\r\nAccept his kiss, even if it _is_ from a mouth rimmed with supper. And\r\ndon\'t rub it off till he\'s gone out, you damned fool. You frightened\r\nfool. You shaking, sweating, terror-stricken fool.\r\n\r\nWho\'s he going to kiss when you\'re not here?\r\n\r\nThe tree has stopped. Our little tree is having its supper. How nice.\r\nSucking sustenance direct from soil with aid of sun and air in true\r\nplant fashion--but exhausting our mineral resources.\r\n\r\n(How wise of Ted to make you go to those lectures! You wouldn\'t want to\r\ndie in ignorance, would you?)\r\n\r\nThe lecture--come on, let\'s go back to the lecture! Let\'s free our soil\r\nfrom every tree or we\'ll not hold the joint in fee. No, not joint. A\r\nvulgarism, teacher would say. Methinks the times are out of joint.\r\nAroint thee, tree!\r\n\r\nNow a pinch. Pinch yourself hard in the same old place so it\'ll hurt\r\nreal bad. Then straighten your face and go stick your head out the\r\nwindow. Your son is talking--your son, your sun.\r\n\r\nCan your son be eclipsed by a tree? A matter of special spatial\r\nrelationships, and the space is shrinking, friend. The tree is only a\r\nfew hundred feet from the house. It has finished its little supper and\r\nis now running around. Like Richard. 

=== Chunk 13 ===
_With_ Richard! Congenial, what?\r\n\r\nSmile, stupid. Your son speaks. Answer him.\r\n\r\n"What, dear?"\r\n\r\n"I see Daddy! He just came over the hill. He\'s running! Can I go meet\r\nhim, Mommie?"\r\n\r\n"No, dear. It\'s too far."\r\n\r\nToo far. Far too far.\r\n\r\n"Did you say something to me, Richard?"\r\n\r\n"No. I was talking to the tree. I\'m the Spaceman and he\'s the Martian.\r\nBut he doesn\'t want to be the Martian!"\r\n\r\nRichard plays. Let us play. Let us play.\r\n\r\nYou\'re close enough to get into the game, surely. A hundred and fifty\r\nfeet, maybe. Effective range, fifty feet. Rate of motion? Projected\r\ntime-interval? Depends on which system you observe it from. Richard has\r\na system.\r\n\r\n"He doesn\'t want to play, Mommie. He wants to see you!"\r\n\r\n"You tell that tree your Mommie _never_ sees strangers when Daddy isn\'t\r\nhome!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll _make_ him wait!"\r\n\r\nStoutly your pot-bellied little protector prevents his protective mother\r\nfrom going to pot.\r\n\r\n"If he won\'t play, I\'ll use my ray gun on him!"\r\n\r\nObviously, the tree won\'t play. Watch your son lift empty hands, arm\r\nhimself with a weapon yet to be invented, and open fire on the advancing\r\nfoe.\r\n\r\n"Aa-aa-aa!"\r\n\r\nSo _that\'s_ how a ray gun sounds!\r\n\r\n"You\'re dead, tree! You\'re dead! 

=== Chunk 14 ===
Now you _can\'t_ play with me any more.\r\nYou\'re dead!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSeeing it happen, then, watching the tree accept the little boy\'s\r\nfantasy as fact, Naomi wondered why she\'d never thought of that herself.\r\n\r\nSo the tree was a treacherous medicine-man, was it? A true-believing\r\nwitch-doctor? And who could be more susceptible to the poisoning of fear\r\nthan a witch-doctor who has made fear work--and believes it\'s being used\r\nagainst him?\r\n\r\nIt was all over. She and the tree bit the dust together. But the tree\r\nwas dead, and Naomi merely fainting, and Ted would soon be home ...\r\n\r\n                                                        --DAVE DRYFOOS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Galaxy Science Fiction_ October 1952.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.
