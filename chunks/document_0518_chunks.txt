Under our employee policy, this is\r\nallowable, effective upon completion of your current assignment. Under\r\nprecedent set as long ago as 2347 A. D. the company will even pay the\r\ncost of your message of resignation.\r\n\r\nHowever, the words "you balloon brain" do not seem a necessary part of\r\nthat message and will be deducted from your salary.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I have a few words of my own to say. You march straight\r\ninto my office, Michaels, just as soon as you get back from Eros. Eros?\r\nWHAT IN HELL ARE YOU DOING ON EROS?\r\n\r\nHorrocks\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nROCKET MAIL (First Class)\r\n\r\nMr. H. E. Horrocks\r\n\r\nDear Balloon Brain:\r\n\r\nIf you paid a little more attention to your office and less to that\r\ngolf course on Venus, you\'d know what I am doing on Eros. I got here\r\ntwo days ago via Mars with a herd of six wrestlers, in accordance with\r\nyour own written memorandum. We were to appear at an Auruchs club\r\nsmoker.\r\n\r\nUpon arrival, I found that no preparations had been made for us and\r\nnobody knows anything about an Auruchs club.\r\n\r\nThe people here are nuts. They talk in six syllable words and their\r\nidea of a good time is to sniff flowers and do five dimensional\r\ncalculus. They have less use for wrestlers than I have for you.\r\n\r\nMichaels\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nROCKET MAIL (Second Class)\r\n\r\nMichaels, you nitwit:\r\n\r\nThat wasn\'t _Eros_, you idiot! You were supposed to go to _Erie_--Erie,\r\nPa., right here on Earth!\r\n\r\nIf you remembered even your sixth grade Solar System history, you\r\nwould know that the planetoid Eros was settled in 2141 by a group of\r\nlonghairs headed by Prof. M. R. Snock, a philosopher with a dozen\r\nuniversity degrees.\r\n\r\nHe wanted to show that war, crime and all forms of violence would\r\ndisappear if people thought only beautiful thoughts.\r\n\r\nThe planetoid is lousy rich with erydnium ore and the people keep in\r\nluxury selling it to space freighters. They spend their time being\r\ngentle and thinking beautiful.

There hasn\'t even been a spitball thrown\r\nthere in eight generations.\r\n\r\nA _fine_ place for you to show up mahouting six wrestlers with no\r\nforeheads. You\'re lucky they haven\'t thrown you in jail.\r\n\r\nHorrocks\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nROCKET MAIL (Postage Due)\r\n\r\nMr. H. E. Horrocks\r\n\r\nDear Jellyhead:\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean lucky? We _are_ in jail.\r\n\r\nRight after we got here, the boys decided they had been cramped in that\r\nlocal spaceship and needed a workout to limber up. As soon as they got\r\nstarted, they were surrounded by a bunch of scrawny males, all sniffing\r\nhollyhocks.\r\n\r\nTheir spokesman, a bald bird with rosebuds in his whiskers, touched\r\nme with a gold-headed cane and said that apparently we were not yet\r\nattuned to the high mental plane of the planetoid, and would we mind\r\ngoing into protective custody while they worked over our egos and cured\r\nour kineticism.\r\n\r\nI said suppose we wouldn\'t. He looked shocked and waved his flower and\r\nsaid that then, although it had never happened before, he supposed\r\nhe would have to call the space patrol and have us thrown into the\r\nhoosegow on Ganymede.\r\n\r\nI translated that into basic wrestler for the boys and we agreed we\'d\r\nbetter go along. We\'d heard about the jail those tough space patrol\r\nbabies operate on Ganymede.\r\n\r\nThe flower lovers took us to an old erydnium pit and asked us to\r\nplease go down. Now they\'re perfuming us every hour and feeding us\r\nflower bulbs to make us gentle.\r\n\r\nWe could climb out of this rat-hole whenever we wanted, but that would\r\nbe climbing straight into a striped spacesuit.\r\n\r\nI think about you all the time. And if you think they\'re beautiful\r\nthoughts, you\'re as crazy as I\'ve always suspected.\r\n\r\nMichaels\r\n\r\nP.S. The boys asked that I enclose this note from them:\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Horox:\r\n\r\nWe do not like it here Mr.

YOU ARE BEST OF ALL\r\nPOSSIBLE BOSSES. IMPROBABLE AS IT SEEMS, I LOVE YOU.\r\n\r\nJED\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSPACEGRAM\r\n\r\nMr. Jed Michaels,\r\n\r\nRyttuk, Eros\r\n\r\nONLY ONE POSSIBLE CAUSE FOR YOUR LAST SPACEGRAM.

Horrocks\r\n\r\nMy dear employer and pal:\r\n\r\nEros is a _wonderful_ asteroid!\r\n\r\nToward the end of the second day in the pit, the wrestlers limbered\r\nup. Zbich and the Gorilla Man worked out on headlocks, Gorgeous Gordon\r\ndid calisthenics, and Barefoot Charley, Choker Jonas and the Faceless\r\nWonder got themselves into a grunting free-for-all.\r\n\r\nAfter that got under way, I heard a squeal and a girl came bounding\r\ndown the pit side. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
She was young and dark-haired and pretty. She\r\nmight have been as intellectual as the president of Harvard above the\r\nshoulders, but what a framework she had to hold up that brain!\r\n\r\nShe went over to Gorgeous Gordon and she said, "Ooh!" With all the\r\nflower lovers around here, it was probably the first man with muscles\r\nshe had ever seen.\r\n\r\nThe big ham swelled up. He flexed his arms and stuck out his chest.\r\n"OOH!" said the girl, and went bounding back up the side of the pit.\r\n\r\nI stopped the exercise and the wrestlers sat and mused blankly at each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes, our little visitor was back again. With her were\r\nabout a dozen pals, differing in details, but resembling her in the\r\nimportant points.\r\n\r\nThe leader was a tall, brown-haired, gray-eyed girl, with a face where\r\nintellect fought a losing battle with a dimple. The others helped her\r\ndown the pit side as if she were something fragile and precious, like\r\nmaybe a new bottle of perfume.\r\n\r\nThen our pal went back to Gorgeous Gordon. "More ooh!" said the girl\r\nguide.\r\n\r\nYou know how wrestlers are. They\'ll slap each other silly to get the\r\ncheers of four kids on a street corner, or commit mayhem for a purse\r\nbig enough to buy a ham hock. In five seconds, we had going one of the\r\nfinest wrestling matches in the history of good, clean sportsmanship.\r\nAnd over the cracking of wrestler\'s bones rose the shrieks of the\r\ngirls, showing that their throats were in the right place, even if\r\ntheir brains weren\'t.\r\n\r\nThe gray-eyed girl sat with me on a flange of unmined ore. She was\r\nAliana, a direct descendant of the leader of the Eros pioneers. As\r\nsuch, she was princess of the planetoid, although she left most of the\r\ngoverning to a council of elders, apparently as outstanding an array of\r\nmossbacks as ever smelled a gardenia or just plain smelled.\r\n\r\n"I sometimes think, Mr. Michaels," Aliana told me, "that we of Eros\r\nhave laid too much stress upon the cerebral. I wonder if our lives\r\nwould not be fuller if we also included some of the more vigorous\r\nactivities, such as the one in which those men are now engaged."\r\n\r\n"If it\'s a vacation for your mind that you want, Princess," I agreed,\r\n"those boys are your meat."\r\n\r\nJust then the Gorilla Man got a leg split on Barefoot Charley and began\r\nto braid his toes.\r\n\r\n"How stimulating," breathed Aliana. "What is proper for the onlooker to\r\nremark in such a situation?"\r\n\r\n"A satisfactory outcry, Princess," I explained, "is, \'Break it off!\'"\r\n\r\n"Break it off!" encouraged Aliana.\r\n\r\nI had to wind it up, finally, before the wrestlers reduced themselves\r\nto blubber, thereby forcing the Interplanetary Amusement Corp. to go\r\nout and lasso itself another herd.\r\n\r\nThe girls went giggling up the side of the pit. At the top, Aliana\r\nwaved at me. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
The others blew kisses, not caring much where they landed,\r\nas long as the receiver had muscles.\r\n\r\nNext morning, a young man came into the pit. He announced that, upon\r\nPrinces Aliana\'s orders, we were to have the freedom of Eros, so that\r\ncontact with the planetoid culture could win us from our uncouth ways.\r\n\r\nHe was too young to be wholly gentled by the flowers and the council\r\nof elders. So the Choker showed him a wristlock. And when the Choker\r\ntossed him on his ear in the erydnium ore, he said words that were not\r\nbeautiful. Maybe there\'s something to the people of this asteroid.\r\n\r\nAnyway, everything is great now. We wander wherever we please, as long\r\nas we return to the pit to sleep. When nobody is looking, we sneak into\r\nthe royal palace courtyard and put on a wrestling show for the girls.\r\n\r\nAnd the nights! Ah, the nights!\r\n\r\nDon\'t turn entirely green with envy, Hankus. At least leave your nose\r\nthe familiar red.\r\n\r\nJed\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSPACEGRAM\r\n\r\nTo: Jed Michaels, Ryttuk, Eros\r\n\r\nFINE WORK. RETURN IMMEDIATELY.

The elders caught us\r\ngiving a rassle when Aliana was away and we\'re in again.\r\n\r\nThese flower roots taste terrible.\r\n\r\nJed\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSPACEGRAM\r\n\r\nTo: Jed Michaels,\r\n\r\nRyttuk, Eros\r\n\r\nYOU BLUNDERING BABOON, YOU\'RE FIRED.\r\n\r\nHORROCKS\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nROCKET MAIL\r\n\r\n(Free, Royal Frank)\r\n\r\nRoyal Palace, Eros\r\n\r\nTo: H. E. Horrocks,\r\n\r\nCosmopolis, Earth\r\n\r\nDear melon brain:\r\n\r\nI gather from your last message that you wish to discharge me. I accept\r\nthe offer, fat boy. In fact, under royal Eros precedent, which I made\r\nup three minutes ago, we will even pay for your message. However,\r\nthe words "you blundering baboon" do not seem a necessary part of\r\nthat message, and their cost will be taken out of the first bit of\r\nbusiness that the royal house of Eros decides to honor your puny little\r\ncorporation with.\r\n\r\nIf any.\r\n\r\nTimes are changed, Hankus. I\'m a big shot now.\r\n\r\nA few hours after we got back in the pit, Aliana came back and sneaked\r\ndown to see us. She said she thought it was about time to end this\r\ncouncil of elders\' nonsense and she asked our help.\r\n\r\nI told her plan to the wrestlers in words of one syllable or less. They\r\nall agreed except the Faceless Wonder.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see why I should have nothing to do with no book," he said. It\r\nseems he had had a book once and chewed up the first three chapters\r\nbefore he found put it wasn\'t something to eat.\r\n\r\nI signaled to the boys. Zbich clamped a headlock on him. The Choker got\r\na hammerlock. The Gorilla Man took him in a scissors. Gorgeous Gordon\r\ngot a toehold and Barefoot Charley stood by to jump on his stomach.\r\n\r\n"Do you understand now?" I asked politely.\r\n\r\n"Sure, Jed, sure," said the Faceless Wonder. "Why didn\'t ya explain it\r\nto me in the first place?"\r\n\r\nSo the next morning, we yelled for books. And for the following days,\r\nwhenever anybody was around, we were busy sniffing flowers and reading.\r\nBetween times, I tried to explain to the wrestlers why there weren\'t\r\nmore pictures in the books.\r\n\r\nA week later, we sprang the trap. I told the stablehand who brought us\r\nour fodder that I had taken in so much culture that I was breathing\r\nbeauty. Zbich, gagging a little, asked for a second helping of flower\r\nroots. Gorgeous Gordon requested a needle and thread; he said he had\r\nfallen behind in his needlepoint.\r\n\r\nA report of the conversation got to the council of elders and it\r\nbrought them to the lip of the pit, looking like something the glue\r\nfactory had refused to accept. Aliana was with them.\r\n\r\nI bowed from the waist and made a speech. I thanked the elders for\r\nshowing me the error of my ways. I said that, after staying in the\r\nlovely erydnium pit, I was enraptured with flowers, crazy about culture\r\nand practically engaged in five dimension calculus. I asked that I and\r\nthe boys could have the priceless boon of walking freely around Eros,\r\nswapping beautiful thoughts with the local yokels.\r\n\r\nThe elders went into a deep state of flutter. Most of them were for\r\naccepting our proposition out of hand--which was bad. Our old pal with\r\nthe beard saved us.\r\n\r\n"But I saw these men romping," he shrilled. He lowered his voice to a\r\nhigh alto. "Positively romping!"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps these men could prove their sincerity," Aliana said, winking\r\nat me. "Perhaps one of them would consent to illustrate what he has\r\nlearned here by giving a public talk on some scientific subject."\r\n\r\n"I should be glad," I answered, "to hack off a lecture for the good\r\nfolk of Eros. Suppose I give it on anatomy."\r\n\r\nAnd so it was decided.\r\n\r\nExactly as we had planned.\r\n\r\nThere was an amphitheater which the inhabitants of Eros had been using\r\nfor ballets, string quartets and lectures by such of the longhairs as\r\ngot stuffed so full of long words that they couldn\'t keep them to\r\nthemselves. I had ringposts and ropes set up on the platform, saying I\r\nneeded them to illustrate my talk. I got into the ring with Gorgeous\r\nGordon and Zbich, who were dressed in trunks and bathrobes.\r\n\r\nThe wit and beauty of Eros was assembled there, the beauty being\r\nrepresented by the girls, and the wit--such as it was--by the council\r\nof elders. The rest of the seats were filled with other forms, some of\r\nthem tolerably easy to look at.\r\n\r\nI had picked out the subject of anatomy in the belief that none of the\r\ninhabitants of Eros knew anything about it.\r\n\r\nThe men didn\'t notice and the women had nothing at all to look at,\r\nanyway.\r\n\r\nI went into my act.\r\n\r\n"Kind hosts, friends and unfortunate incidents," I said. "My topic is\r\nthe science of anatomy. Now, the science of anatomy is copacetic to the\r\npoint of mopery. The cerebellum is distended and the duodenum goes into\r\na state of e pluribus unum. Incalculably, thrombosis registers and the\r\nectoplasm becomes elliptic. Or, in the vernacular, the eight ball in\r\nthe side pocket."\r\n\r\nThe crowd sat stunned. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
Here and there, a flower sniffer looked down at\r\nhis own rack of bones to check my statement.\r\n\r\n"Let me illustrate," I said. I drew the bathrobes off the wrestlers.\r\n\r\nThe boys\' muscles rippled as they strutted around the ring. From the\r\nwomen spectators came a long, deep sigh. From that moment, we had half\r\nthe audience with us--the female half.\r\n\r\n"In anatomy," I said, shaking my finger to emphasize the point, "the\r\nwingback shifts outward for a lateral. In the words of the great\r\nphilosopher Hypocritus, the coil should always be kept clean between\r\nthe barrel and the tap and all excess collar should be removed with a\r\nspatula."\r\n\r\nNobody was listening to me; they were looking at the wrestlers, which,\r\nof course, was what I\'d figured on. Most of the men were comparing the\r\ngrunters\' muscles to their own, and here and there a few were dropping\r\ntheir flowers onto the floor.\r\n\r\nI signaled and in a second the boys were an omelet of flying legs. The\r\ncrowd gasped, then leaned forward intently. The shrieking began when\r\nGordon got a headlock on Zbich. It grew when Zbich flipped Gorgeous\r\nwith a flying mare. By the time Gordon got in a billygoat butt, the\r\namphitheater sounded like feeding time at the zoo.\r\n\r\nBut there was another sound, too. Old Whiskers was tottering down the\r\naisle, shrieking, "This is romping! 

=== Chunk 9 ===
Mere romping!"\r\n\r\nI signaled and the boys stopped.\r\n\r\n"We need a third man to illustrate the next point," I said. "Perhaps\r\nthe gentleman in the aisle will volunteer."\r\n\r\nTwo wrestlers grabbed Old Whiskers and tossed him into the ring. Making\r\nfast double talk, I took off his shirt and he stood there, stripped to\r\nthe waist, blinking in the sun and looking like a dehydrated squab.\r\n\r\nThe crowd noted the contrast between his scrawniness and the muscles of\r\nthe wrestlers. A roar of laughter swept it.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps," I said, "the gentleman would like to romp."\r\n\r\nZbich made a grab for him and he scuttled out of the ring, falling over\r\nthe lower rope. A woman in the first row slugged him with a gardenia.\r\n\r\n"Sit down, you old fool!" She turned to the wrestlers. "Break it off!"\r\nshe shouted.\r\n\r\nThe match went on.\r\n\r\nIn my career, including my medicine show days, I\'ve had lots of easy\r\nmarks, but nothing to compare to the crowd at Eros\' first wrestling\r\nmatch. When Gorgeous took the first fall with a body scissors, they\r\nwent mad; when Zbich evened it up, they went hysterical; when Zbich\r\ntook the deciding fall, they were delirious. And at the end of the\r\nmatch between Choker Jonas and the Faceless Wonder, they were reduced\r\nto a jelly. We had to call off the third match for fear we would have\r\nto take them home in jars.\r\n\r\nAt the end, we went in a body, led by the wrestlers, and threw the\r\ncouncil of elders into the erydnium pit. We are keeping them now on a\r\ndiet of raw meat.\r\n\r\nThe amphitheater has been converted into a permanent wrestling arena.\r\nWe\'ve laid out a football and a baseball field in the lyceum grove, and\r\nnext week we\'ll start turning the botanical garden into a golf course.\r\n\r\nTo carry out the full program, we shall have to buy some equipment\r\nand hire some talent. Whether we toss some of the business to\r\nInterplanetary depends, Hankus boy, entirely on what attitude\r\nInterplanetary takes toward you know who.\r\n\r\nWhen you write your crawling letter, you worm, address me as "Your\r\nMightiness." I am minister of athletics on Eros now and the second most\r\nimportant person on the planetoid.\r\n\r\nMy work takes me close to the Princess Aliana. Very close.\r\n\r\nCome to think of it, I wish there was a moon on Eros. It\'s not\r\nessential, but it helps.\r\n\r\nSo long, peasant.\r\n\r\nJED\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s The Celestial Hammerlock, by Donald Colvin\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
