It\r\n            was a good reason why he must fight for this--\r\n\r\n                           Voyage To Procyon\r\n\r\n                         By Robert Silverberg\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Imagination Stories of Science and Fantasy\r\n                               June 1958\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the deepest level of the mighty _Starship I_, Peter Conroy lay\r\nhidden in a cornfield. Around him waved the tall stalks of ripening\r\ncorn; high overhead, near the distant ceiling of the level, blazed the\r\nactinic lights that irradiated the broad field.\r\n\r\nAnd nearby, Conroy could hear the stealthy footsteps of Bayliss Kent\r\nand his men, searching desperately for him. They _had_ to find him--and\r\nPeter Conroy had to keep from being found.\r\n\r\nCrouching low, he edged forward between the bending stalks. Kent\r\nthought he had Conroy hemmed in, that he had the entrance to the\r\ncornfield guarded. Conroy grinned. He had been brought up in the\r\nAgronomy section; Kent and his men hadn\'t. It made a difference.\r\n\r\nHe looked around carefully, then began moving slowly away from them\r\non his hands and knees. _If I can only reach the irrigation tube in\r\ntime_, he thought. _If_--\r\n\r\nIt had been over fifty years since the _Starship I_ had left Earth. For\r\nmore than half a century, the great ship had been headed toward the\r\nstar Procyon and the planets around it--habitable planets, detected by\r\nthe Lunar telescope. Fifty years, and there was still a hundred years\r\nof flight yet to come before the huge ship reached her destination.\r\n\r\nConroy and all the others of his generation had been born on the ship,\r\nas had most of their parents before them. The ship, with its vast\r\nfarms, its great factories, and its clusters of living centers, was all\r\nthe world they knew.\r\n\r\nBut Bayliss Kent and his little party of malcontents wanted to change\r\nall that. They wanted to go back to Earth.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, something crackled under Conroy\'s knee, and he froze. A dry\r\nleaf--nothing more. But had the others heard it?\r\n\r\nHe couldn\'t be sure. The searchers were making quite a bit of noise\r\nthemselves, and perhaps they might have thought it was one of their own\r\ngroup who had made the sound. He decided to risk it, and moved on.\r\n\r\nJust ahead of him was the irrigation tube. Again Conroy called on his\r\nspecial knowledge of the Agronomy section. This particular acreage of\r\ncorn was in the harvest season--almost ready to cut. There wouldn\'t be\r\nany water in the irrigation tubes now.\r\n\r\nThe tube was a little over three feet across and dropped down into the\r\nsub-levels of the ship, where the water-purifiers were. Conroy peered\r\ninto the tube\'s depths for a moment, then lifted up the hinged cover,\r\nlowered himself into the tube, and braced his feet against one side and\r\nhis shoulders against the other.\r\n\r\nClosing the cover, then, in total blackness, he began to lower himself\r\ndown the tube. Hands, shoulders, feet; hands, shoulders, feet. Over and\r\nover again, as mountain climbers work their way up and down crevasses.\r\n\r\nAfter several minutes, he was startled by a sudden glow of light from\r\nabove. He glanced up. The opening of the tube was nearly a hundred\r\nfeet overhead now. He wondered if they would be able to pick him out in\r\nthe darkness, this far down the shaft.\r\n\r\n"Can you see him?" called a voice that echoed through the steel tube.\r\nConroy could see a head silhouetted against the light.\r\n\r\n"It goes straight down, and there\'s no ladder," came the reply. It was\r\nBayliss Kent\'s voice. "I don\'t see him down there."\r\n\r\n"What kind of tube is this?" the first voice asked. Hal Lester, Kent\'s\r\nchief henchman.\r\n\r\n"Irrigation, I think."\r\n\r\n"Well, if he _has_ managed to get down it, he\'s gotten clean away.\r\nBayliss, I told you we shouldn\'t have let Conroy know our plans."\r\n\r\n"Never mind that now!" Kent snapped coldly. "Search the cornfield! He\r\nmust be here somewhere--and we\'ve got to find him before the local\r\nagronomist comes by on his inspection rounds."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was the sound of the door being lowered, and darkness came again.\r\nPeter Conroy heaved a sigh of relief and continued working his way down\r\nthe tube.\r\n\r\nHe knew these tubes well. His father was an Agronomist, and, until\r\nPeter had taken up navigation, he had helped his father on the\r\nfarmlands. The ship was like a sealed world, a hollow metal planet\r\nfive miles in diameter that was carrying its crew through space on the\r\ngenerations-long voyage to Procyon.\r\n\r\nOr would the starship ever get to Procyon? Was Bayliss Kent going to\r\nsucceed in his plan to force the Commander to reverse the ship and\r\nreturn to Earth?\r\n\r\nNot if they depended on Peter Conroy to navigate for them, they\r\nwouldn\'t!\r\n\r\nConroy, working his way down the tube, suddenly felt emptiness as he\r\nlowered one foot. He had come to the end of the vertical tube. Twisting\r\nhimself upright, he dropped the remaining six feet into the huge\r\narterial tube that ran horizontally into this sector of the ship. The\r\nescape hatch shouldn\'t be too far from here. The pipes needed cleaning\r\nafter the irrigation period was over and the tubes had entrance ports\r\nfor the purpose. Conroy strode down the tube in total darkness, keeping\r\none hand against the side. He opened the hatch and found himself in one\r\nof the pumping rooms.\r\n\r\n"Halt right there!" a voice said. "You\'re under arrest!"\r\n\r\nIt was one of the pumping room guards, levelling a snub-nosed stun gun\r\nat him. "Who are you? You know it\'s illegal to be in the irrigation\r\ntubes without authorization."\r\n\r\n"I know," said Conroy. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
He knew he had no time to make explanations. He\r\nhad to get to the Ship\'s Commander.\r\n\r\nHe stepped forward too quickly for the astonished guard to react. His\r\nfist ploughed into the man\'s chin, and his other arm deflected the\r\nsnout of the stun gun just enough to send the neutrino stream over his\r\nleft shoulder. The gun clattered to the floor.\r\n\r\nThe guard turned, aimed a wild swing. Conroy walked inside the other\r\nman\'s guard and dropped him with a short punch to the stomach.\r\nWhirling, he grabbed the stun gun and gave the man a brief, numbing\r\nblast.\r\n\r\nOpening the entrance to the tube, he dumped the unconscious guard in,\r\nsaluted the disappearing man with grim irony, and slammed the door\r\nclosed, jamming the lock. It would be quite some time before the guard\r\nfound his way out of the tubes.\r\n\r\nHe put the stun gun in his belt and pulled his tunic down over it. Then\r\nhe headed for the levitator shaft that would take him up to Officer\'s\r\nTerritory.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was not easy for a young officer to get to see the Captain; the\r\nold man held many lives in his hands, and he was busy most of the\r\ntime. But Peter Conroy didn\'t dare trust his message to one of the\r\nunderlings; he had no way of knowing how many of them were already\r\nsympathizers with Bayliss Kent. Undoubtedly, many of the younger\r\nofficers were with him.\r\n\r\nKent\'s idea was simple. Why should the younger generation spend their\r\nentire lives cooped up on the _Starship I_, he asked? If the ship were\r\nturned around now and full power were applied, they could make it back\r\nto Earth in a little over ten years. That, of course, would use up all\r\nthe fuel that would normally be used in the next hundred years--but\r\nwhat would that matter, if they were back on Earth?\r\n\r\nAnd Bayliss Kent had also pointed out that there was no possible\r\ndanger of a counter-revolution. Once the ship started back, it would\r\nhave burned so much fuel that it could only continue on to Earth--it\r\ncouldn\'t try for Procyon again.\r\n\r\nTo many of the younger men, it seemed like a good idea.\r\n\r\nBut they needed a navigator. The logical one, they had thought, was\r\nPeter Conroy. But Conroy, shocked at the idea of mutiny against the\r\nCaptain, had made the mistake of telling Bayliss Kent to his face that\r\nhe would have nothing to do with the plot.\r\n\r\nThey had been in a Shopping Center at the time. Kent had simply drawn\r\nhis gun and marched Conroy to the Agricultural Section. The idea had\r\nbeen to kill him and bury him in the field. The body wouldn\'t be found\r\nfor at least a year, possibly never.\r\n\r\nConroy had barely managed to escape with his life.\r\n\r\nAnd now, he had to get word to the Captain before Bayliss Kent did\r\nanything desperate.\r\n\r\nHe walked down the long corridor toward the Captain\'s Quarters. There\r\nwere officers bustling around the corridor, moving from one office to\r\nanother; most of them were administrative officers, doing their job of\r\ngoverning the people of the ship.\r\n\r\nThe guard at the door of the Administration Office saluted him and said\r\nnothing as he went inside. He walked over to the appointment desk.\r\n\r\n"I\'d like to see the Executive Officer, please," he said.\r\n\r\nHe had to see the Exec to get permission to speak with the Captain. He\r\nexpected to have to wait quite a while even for the Exec, and so he was\r\nquite surprised when the pretty blonde sergeant told him to go right in.\r\n\r\n"He\'s in conference," she said, "but he wants you there."\r\n\r\n"Thanks," Conroy said, puzzled.\r\n\r\nHe walked into the Exec\'s mahogany-panelled office--and found himself\r\nstaring squarely down the muzzle of Bayliss Kent\'s pistol.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Well, well--the prodigal returns." Kent\'s lean face wore an ugly\r\nsneer. "Get your hands above your head, Conroy."\r\n\r\n"How did you get here?" Conroy demanded. "And where\'s the Exec?"\r\n\r\nKent shrugged. "How did we get in? 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Very simple. I told the Exec\r\nI had important news of a mutiny--which I did. The Exec has\r\nbeen--ah--disposed of."\r\n\r\n"And I suppose you\'re going to kill me now?"\r\n\r\n"No," Kent said surprisingly. "Things have changed." His eyes narrowed.\r\n"One of my men got a little over-enthusiastic, I\'m afraid. The Chief\r\nNavigator has been killed."\r\n\r\n"And you think I\'ll navigate for you?"\r\n\r\n"You\'ll have to," Kent said in blunt tones. "You see, we\'re going to\r\nturn the ship around. If you don\'t navigate, the ship will never get\r\nback to Earth." He smiled coldly. "Surely, an idealist like yourself\r\nwould never allow a shipload of innocent people to drift through space\r\nfor all eternity."\r\n\r\nConroy felt a chill at Bayliss Kent\'s words. He knew that Kent was\r\nright. He _had_ to do it--unless he could stop Bayliss Kent first.\r\nAnd it didn\'t look as though he had much chance. There were five men\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\n"What are you going to do?" Conroy asked. "Lock up the main officers?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid we\'ll have to kill them," Kent said flatly.\r\n\r\n"But why? Once you turn the ship around and start back, there won\'t be\r\nanything they can do."\r\n\r\n"Not to the ship," said Kent. "But they could have us killed anyway.\r\nAnd, after all, the main reason for this mutiny is to make sure that we\r\nsee Earth before we die."\r\n\r\nKent signalled to two of the men. "Take him back and lock him up in the\r\ncell. Watch him while the rest of us finish the job.

=== Chunk 4 ===
"\r\n\r\nHe gestured behind himself. The Executive Officer was the\r\nlaw-enforcement officer aboard the ship, and behind his office the\r\ndetention cells were located.\r\n\r\nConroy felt the two men grab his arms and push him through the open\r\ndoor into a cell.\r\n\r\nOne of his captors pressed a vibro-key against the locking plate, and\r\nthe magnetic field came on, clamping the door tight against the frame.\r\n\r\n"That ought to hold you," the man said hoarsely, and with his companion\r\nreturned to the Exec Officer\'s cabin, leaving Conroy alone.\r\n\r\nConroy sat down heavily on the metal bench along the side of the\r\ncell and strained his ears for voices from without. He couldn\'t hear\r\nanything. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Evidently Kent and his henchmen had set about their mutinous\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nConroy scowled. He knew what he was up against personally. They would\r\nlock him in the Navigation Observatory for the next ten years, keeping\r\nhim prisoner while he guided the _Starship I_ back to Earth. In all\r\nprobability, they would shoot him as soon as he was no longer needed as\r\nnavigator. It would be, he thought, better to die now. But if he did,\r\nthere would be no one to navigate the ship--and once the fuel gave out,\r\nall people aboard would be forever lost.\r\n\r\nOf course, it might be possible to figure a way out in ten years. And\r\neven if he didn\'t, he could leave a message in the navigation log for\r\nthe officials on Earth to decode. But what good would that do, really?\r\nIf this expedition failed to reach Procyon, a century of human effort\r\nwould have been wasted.\r\n\r\nConroy decided he\'d have to take his chances now. This was the time to\r\nact.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe had one asset: the stun gun. They hadn\'t bothered to search him, and\r\nso he had been left with one weapon, of sorts.\r\n\r\nThe trouble with a stun gun was that it wasn\'t deadly. He couldn\'t\r\nsimply point it at the guard who had the vibro-key and force his way\r\nout. All the guard had to do was to refuse to hand the key over. If\r\nConroy stunned him, he wouldn\'t be any better off than before. He had\r\nto think up some alternate plan.\r\n\r\nHe doubled over, clutching at his stomach--and still grasping the stun\r\ngun in his hand. "_Ohhh!_"\r\n\r\nThe guard came over to the door of the cell and peered downward\r\nsuspiciously. "Don\'t pull any phony sickness with me, Conroy. I\'m not\r\ngoing to come into that cell."\r\n\r\nConroy hadn\'t expected him to. Only a fool would fall for that ancient\r\ngambit--but it served Conroy\'s purpose to have the guard come close to\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\nWith one smooth motion, he pulled out the stunner and fired. The guard\r\nlooked astonished for a bare instant, then dropped senseless.\r\n\r\nQuickly, Conroy ran over, put his arm through the bars, took the key,\r\nand applied it to the plate. As the field shut off, he heard a voice.\r\n\r\n"Hey! What\'s going on down there?

=== Chunk 6 ===
"\r\n\r\nConroy swore silently. It was the other guard!\r\n\r\nHe straightened up and surreptitiously pocketed the vibro-key,\r\nremaining inside the cell with the door open. He waited for the other\r\nguard to approach.\r\n\r\n"What happened here?" the guard said, running up with a drawn pistol.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t do anything," Conroy said. "He just keeled over like that."\r\nHe shrugged innocently.\r\n\r\nThe second guard frowned and reholstered his pistol in order to bend\r\nover his fallen companion. That was just what Conroy had been waiting\r\nfor. He jerked up the stun gun and fired.\r\n\r\nAnd nothing happened.\r\n\r\nThe gun\'s charge was gone!\r\n\r\n"Hey!" At the sound of the click, the second guard snapped his head up\r\nand went for his gun.\r\n\r\nConroy hurled the useless stunner straight between the bars of the\r\ncell. The butt of the gun struck the guard between the eyes, and he\r\ndropped to the floor on top of his companion.\r\n\r\nActing quickly, Conroy threw open the door of the cell and scooped up\r\nthe ray pistols of the two guards. Then, shoving them both within the\r\ncell, he locked them in with the vibro-key. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
He smiled. So far, so good.\r\nHe turned to run back toward the Exec\'s office.\r\n\r\nThere was no one there. He eased the outer door, gun in hand.\r\nEverything looked normal enough, in the outer office. Hiding the ray\r\npistol in his tunic, he strode boldly out.\r\n\r\nThe blonde at the desk said: "Why, yes, sir. The Captain and the other\r\nmain officers left here several minutes ago."\r\n\r\n"Was anyone with them?"\r\n\r\n"Ah--yes, there was," she said. "Lieutenant Bayliss Kent and some other\r\njunior officers."\r\n\r\nConroy nodded. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
That was as expected. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
"Did they say where they were\r\ngoing?"\r\n\r\n"There seems to be something wrong with the atomic furnace at Number\r\nNineteen Thrust Tube. I heard them say they were going down to check\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Thanks.

=== Chunk 10 ===
"\r\n\r\nHe had no time to call anyone, no time to explain. He had to move\r\nfast if he was going to save the Captain and the others. Somehow, the\r\nthought of Kent\'s murdering the Captain was inconceivable. The old man\r\nhad been on the ship half a century; he was the last survivor of the\r\noriginal crew, and was as much a part of the great starship by now as\r\nthe drive engines and the navigator\'s turret.\r\n\r\nConroy could see the whole fiendish plan. Bayliss Kent had forced the\r\nship\'s officers down to Number Nineteen Thrust Tube, one of the huge\r\nprojectors that drove the mighty ship through space. All Kent needed to\r\ndo would be to kill them with ray pistols and claim that something had\r\ngone wrong with the atomic furnace. It would be impossible to disprove.\r\n\r\nAnd then Bayliss Kent would be Captain.\r\n\r\nUnless Peter Conroy could stop him.\r\n\r\nHe raced through the gleaming, twisting corridors of the giant ship,\r\nrunning frantically down and down toward Number Nineteen Thrust Tube.\r\nHe pushed his way past surprised crew members, circled into the lower\r\nlevels of the ship, made his way through the network of passageways\r\nthat led to the blast tubes. Finally he reached Power Section.\r\n\r\nThe guard at the door was one of Kent\'s men. He looked up, startled, as\r\nConroy appeared.\r\n\r\n"Where are you--?"\r\n\r\nBefore the man could do anything, Conroy cut him down with a shot from\r\nhis ray pistol. This was war--civil war--and there was no time for\r\nsubtlety.\r\n\r\nHe stepped over the body and flung open the door of Number Nineteen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe took in the situation in a glance. The Staff Officers, including the\r\nCaptain, were lined up against one wall, and four of Kent\'s men were\r\naiming their ray pistols.\r\n\r\nKent was saying: "Ready--aim--"\r\n\r\nBut the last word never was uttered. Kent was beginning to form it when\r\nConroy got both his guns out and started to fire.\r\n\r\nHis first bolt smashed down the nearest executioner; a fraction of a\r\nsecond later, the man next to him dropped. Their attention deflected\r\nfrom the victims to Conroy, the other two and Kent whirled to face the\r\nnewcomer.\r\n\r\nTwo more bolts blasted out--the first dropping one of the remaining\r\ngunmen, the second singeing Bayliss Kent\'s shoulder. Conroy hit the\r\nfloor as a buzzing blaster bolt from the third man ripped over his head\r\nand splattered into the wall behind him.\r\n\r\nFiring from the floor, he put a bolt through Kent\'s remaining man--a\r\nmoment after the gunman had raked the officers with his blaster. Some\r\nof them were dead; Conroy had no way of telling which ones. He had a\r\nmore urgent problem.\r\n\r\nBayliss Kent was coming toward him--and the blaster needed recharging.\r\n\r\nThere was no time to perform the operation. He hurled the dead pistol\r\nat Kent\'s midsection and plunged after it. Kent met him head on. Even\r\nwith a numbed shoulder, Bayliss Kent was a formidable antagonist. His\r\nbig fists pounded into Conroy\'s stomach, driving him back against the\r\nblaster-seared wall. He felt heat radiating through his uniform, then\r\npushed away and stepped forward.\r\n\r\nHis fist travelled in a short arc and crashed into the already-singed\r\nshoulder of the other man. Kent roared in pain, and Conroy mercilessly\r\ndrove a fist into his stomach, sending him spinning dizzily backward.\r\nConroy followed with a final punch and Kent cracked heavily against the\r\nmetal wall of the unit and slumped to the floor.\r\n\r\nConroy looked around. The mopping-up operation was complete.\r\n\r\nAs for the ship\'s officers, the wide-beam blaster had done its job\r\nwell. Three of the men were shapeless corpses leaning against the wall,\r\nand two of the others were badly wounded. And one of these two was the\r\nage-bent figure of the Captain. The old man was still alive. Conroy\r\nknelt at his side.\r\n\r\n"Captain! Captain Conroy!" Peter shouted.\r\n\r\nThe old man opened his eyes. "Hello, son. That was a beautiful job you\r\ndid."\r\n\r\n"But I was too late!"\r\n\r\nThe old captain shook his head. "No. I didn\'t have much time, anyway.\r\nI\'m a very old man now." He raised himself on one elbow. "Who else is\r\nleft?"\r\n\r\nConroy glanced around. "Supply Officer, Power Officer, Maintenance\r\nOfficer," he said. "And you."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t count," the dying captain said. "You\'ll be able to scratch me\r\nfrom the list soon." 

=== Chunk 11 ===
He frowned. "No Exec? No Navigator?" The Captain\r\nleaned back and closed his weary eyes for a moment, then opened them\r\nagain. 

=== Chunk 12 ===
"It looks like it\'s up to you," he said. His veined, aged hand\r\nwent up to his collar and removed the golden starcluster of his rank.\r\nHe handed it to Peter.\r\n\r\n"Carry on--Captain Conroy."\r\n\r\nHe closed his eyes in death. Conroy stood up slowly, tears in his eyes,\r\nthe golden cluster gripped tightly in his hand. The ship would continue\r\non to Procyon now.\r\n\r\n"I will, Grandfather. I will."\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
