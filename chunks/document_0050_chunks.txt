Boyd\r\n\r\n\r\n     _SALESMAN\'S GUIDE, RULE 2: The modern 1995 customer who\r\n      enters Tracy\'s Department Store is not always right, but as\r\n      far as you are concerned, he is._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe little green cue light blinked three times. Trevor Anson arranged\r\nhis tie at just the nattily precise angle, waved his hand before a\r\nhidden lighting-effect switch in the smooth marble pillar at the\r\nentrance to the display room, and faced the elevator. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
This would be a\r\n"green light" customer--a first-time prospect, and three blinks\r\nindicated a very difficult individual. Anson quickly practiced his\r\nmost beguiling smile.\r\n\r\n"Welcome to Tracy\'s Roboid Department," he said, enthusiastically, as\r\nthe elevator doors slid open. His practiced smile was just right.\r\n\r\nHe quickly noted the man\'s conservative dress, the flaming red tie.\r\nAggressive type, Anson decided. A shock of red hair that didn\'t want\r\nto lie down hinted that he was stubborn as well.\r\n\r\n"Heard you\'ve got a sale on robots," Red-tie said, challengingly, as\r\nhe stepped aside for his wife.\r\n\r\nThe woman who stepped off the elevator smiled, showing a lovely\r\ndimple, and Anson beamed on her. The tiny flake of a hat perched atop\r\nher auburn hair reminded Anson of the comb on a Rhode Island Red.\r\n\r\n"Not robots, sir," Anson corrected diplomatically. "The Plasti-Cast\r\nRoboid is not exactly a robot."\r\n\r\n"Well, anyhow, trot one out, and let\'s see what it looks like.\r\nMillicent will never be satisfied until she\'s seen one of the things."\r\nHe glared dramatically in the general direction of his wife, who\r\npretended not to notice.\r\n\r\nAnson led them into the Gray Room. He mentally went over the\r\napplicable rule: _Rule 23; Always introduce the marked-down\r\nmerchandise first. It may provide the customer with an incentive for\r\nbuying something better._\r\n\r\n"These are last year\'s models," he said, with just the right flavor\r\nof distaste in his voice. "Of course, you may expect a slight\r\nreduction ... a small percentage...."\r\n\r\nRed-tie was muttering. "Damned mechanical things, full of wheels and\r\nwires. What\'s to keep \'em from running amok and killing us all!"\r\n\r\n"But dear, they don\'t have wheels anymore," protested the woman,\r\ntimidly. Her face was pretty, Anson decided, but it was obvious that\r\nthe man would be the deciding factor in this sale.\r\n\r\nHe made a mental note: _Rule 31: Pick the individual of a family group\r\nwho seems to hold the deciding voice, and SELL!_ He remembered a\r\nportion of a sales talk he had memorized a few days before, and took\r\nit up, almost chanting:\r\n\r\n"... our Roboids are grown, much as crystals are grown, in great vats\r\nin New Chicago. A Plasti-Cast Roboid is guaranteed...."\r\n\r\n"A fat chance we\'d have of collecting the guarantee if we were chopped\r\ninto mincemeat," Red-tie interrupted, shuddering slightly as the\r\nimplication of his own words hit him.\r\n\r\nAnson felt a moment of panic as he failed to remember an applicable\r\nrule from the Salesman\'s Guide, but it formed in his mind at the last\r\nmoment: _Rule 18: Never argue with a customer--change the subject._\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you come with me to the Green Room?" he asked.

"The very\r\nlatest models are on display." He walked slowly at first, then more\r\nquickly as the couple allowed themselves to be led. He slid his hand\r\nnear a hidden switch in the archway, and floodlights came on just as\r\nthey entered.\r\n\r\nThe woman uttered a little squeal of delight at the sight of a very\r\nhandsome figure dressed in a cutaway, standing in an attitude of\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" she breathed dreamily. "He would make such a wonderful butler."\r\n\r\n"Well, wind him up and let\'s see what he\'ll do," growled the man, his\r\nface florid in the colored light of the Green Room.\r\n\r\n"I\'m so very sorry," Anson said, slightly flustered, remembering that\r\nthis was always the crucial moment in a sale. "The Roboid cannot be\r\nactivated for demonstration purposes."\r\n\r\n"What?" roared Red-tie, incredulously. "Do you mean to say you want me\r\nto buy the damned thing without knowing whether it ticks or not?"\r\n\r\nAnson tried desperately to remember the best rule for such an answer,\r\nbut failed. He plunged desperately into his own explanation.\r\n\r\n"You see, our Roboids are matched to your family personality at the\r\ntime of purchase, and activated then. We cannot erase a personality\r\nonce it has been transferred to their sensitive minds." He saw the\r\ndisbelieving smirk on the man\'s mouth and felt that the sale was\r\nindeed lost. But he plunged on, desperately.\r\n\r\n"They\'re very economical. They don\'t require any upkeep, like food.\r\nWhen they become tired they will sit or lie down near an electric\r\noutlet and plug in a power cord, and in a few minutes they are as\r\nrested and tireless as...."\r\n\r\n"Bosh!" Red-tie retorted.

"I\'ve heard enough. Come, Millicent, we\r\nstill have time to try Bonn\'s new Helio-rotor. At least they\'ll give\r\nus a demonstration."\r\n\r\nAnson escorted them to the Magna-lift. He felt better as he recalled\r\nthe last rule in the Guide, the one that seemed to cover the situation\r\nso well: _Rule 50: If they balk because of the no-demonstration rule,\r\nlet them go. They will be back when they have seen one of their\r\nfriends with a Plasti-Cast Roboid._\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, Sir; Madam," Anson said wearily, as the Magna-lift doors\r\nclosed. "Come again soon."\r\n\r\nHe breathed a sigh of relief as the elevator cage dropped them from\r\nsight. A salesman, who had been standing by, spoke to Anson.\r\n\r\n"People are _such_ dears at times, aren\'t they?" he said. "However,\r\nit\'s time for your rest period. I\'ll take over now."\r\n\r\n"Thank you so much," Anson replied tiredly.\r\n\r\nHe walked to a tiny room at the far end of the great showroom and\r\nclosed the door. He stretched wearily out on a low, folding cot, the\r\nonly piece of furniture, and reached for a tiny black power cord\r\nhanging nearby.\r\n\r\nDeftly he plugged it into the socket under his armpit, and breathed\r\ndeeply, relaxedly.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he chanted softly, drifting off to sleep, "people _are_ such\r\ndears sometimes."\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
