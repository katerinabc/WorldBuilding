=== Chunk 2 ===
They weren\'t\r\ncheering. They stood in the gray curtain of rain, hunched over with\r\ntheir hands in their storm-coat pockets. Behind them was the vague bulk\r\nof the Experimental Station. And beyond that, invisible in the night,\r\nwere the mountains he would never see again.\r\n\r\n"O.K., Stevens. This is it.

=== Chunk 3 ===
"\r\n\r\nSo what? Stevens clanked as he turned toward the "Coffin." He was\r\nencased in a bulging metal pressure suit and his head was a big alloy\r\nbubble. No one smiled. No one raised a hand to say goodbye.\r\n\r\nDoris would, of course, say goodbye, if she were here. She wasn\'t here.\r\nShe didn\'t even know about his volunteering.\r\n\r\nMajor Kanin nodded stiffly. His gray eyes wrinkled. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
"Good luck,\r\nStevens," he said dutifully. It was meaningless. Kanin had sent too\r\nmany poor guys out on a one-way trip. He knew Stevens wouldn\'t come\r\ndown. Not in any recognizable form.\r\n\r\nA couple of gray-suited mechanics moved around behind Stevens. Stevens\r\nleaned over and thrust his head into the tubular opening of the\r\ntorpedo-like plane. The two mechanics lifted his legs, shoved him in\r\nheadfirst like he was ammunition being crammed into an ancient cannon.\r\nThe metal hatch slid down past his feet. He was bound tightly by the\r\ncockpit which was only an air-conditioned tube but slightly larger than\r\nhis body. When the canopy over his head closed, he had only two inches\r\nbetween the plate in his helmet and the control and instrument panel.\r\n\r\nFor one agonizing moment, long and terrifying, Stevens felt an awful\r\ncompressing suffocation and entrapment. The claustrophobia went away,\r\nin part, and left the plexglas plate in his helmet dewed with his\r\nsweat.\r\n\r\nHe tried to relax. He stared at the controls. He twisted his head\r\ncarefully then so as not to bump his helmet against the side--the noise\r\nwas numbing inside when he did bump anything--and looked through the\r\ntiny peep-hole in the tubular wall which would soon close too, leaving\r\nhim completely sealed. He looked out and waited for the signal. Major\r\nKanin had turned his back and was discussing something with a Doctor\r\nand a Lieutenant. The mechanics were around preparing the kick-off\r\nrockets.\r\n\r\nThe "Coffin" was light, and it was new. A slight improvement over the\r\nlast one. But the so-called improvement was a farce, Stevens knew,\r\nbecause no one had any idea why none of the others had ever come back.\r\nNone of them expected him to come back either, and they showed it\r\nplainly. Also, none of them cared particularly, from any human point of\r\nview. The Military cared of course, from another view-point.\r\n\r\nThis was another velocity test run. Once around the Earth to this\r\ntake-off spot on the desert. The Military wanted to get to the Moon\r\nif they had to walk there over a suspension bridge of human dead.\r\nThe first Sovereign State to get a military base on the Moon would,\r\nin theory, be the all-time victor in what certain kinds of humorists\r\ncalled the "game" of war. So far, no one had been able to stand the\r\nvelocity.\r\n\r\nStevens felt his skin stretch in a dry, tight grin. He carefully and\r\nslowly moistened his lips and watched the light that would blink\r\nyellow. A minute after that the job would kick-off before rockets\r\ndelivering a 3000-pound thrust for twelve seconds.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nStevens guessed that the brain-boys up in some hidden bureau had an\r\nidea that sooner or later they would find somebody who could stand it,\r\nthen they could make tests, find out why. Stevens had no idea how many\r\nhad already been sacrificed. The boys upstairs knew but they weren\'t\r\ngiving out statistics these days. Stevens would increase the unknown\r\nnumber by one more.\r\n\r\nSo it meant nothing, he thought. He wasn\'t one of the superboys, the\r\njet-jyrenes, the hero lads who never came back and had statues and\r\nplaques stuck all over the place for being permanently en absentia. Not\r\nanymore, he wasn\'t.\r\n\r\nHe was one of the new volunteers from the West Coast branch of the\r\nMilitary Prison. Big-hearted Kanin had even promised him a pardon if he\r\nbrought the ship back. It was a new high in irony, but that was about\r\nall.\r\n\r\nHe wouldn\'t come back, and he knew it. But he would be free, and Doris\r\nwould be free to live her own life. He had been stupid, hot-headed,\r\nonce--and this was a preferable way, he had decided, to pay up the debt.\r\n\r\nDoris had resigned herself to waiting for him. It was a manslaughter\r\ncharge, and he would have gotten out maybe in fifteen years. They\r\ndidn\'t parole anybody from a Military Prison, at least not on anything\r\nas heavy as manslaughter. It wasn\'t fair to Doris, nor to himself.\r\n\r\nAll right. He was in a shiny "Coffin" and he would soon be on his way\r\nto wherever the others had gone--into nowhere. Where was nowhere? 

=== Chunk 5 ===
That\r\nwas a question. It was way up, higher than anyone had returned from to\r\nanswer--still within the bounds of gravity but--_high_. A lot of guys\r\nhad found it, but they weren\'t sending back any ESP messages from the\r\nBeyond.\r\n\r\nIt was up there where the Earth lost its face behind thick vapor veils\r\nand began to look like a fancy balloon, that was where you found out\r\nthe location of nowhere. Inside a beautifully stream-lined "Coffin"\r\nyou found out--hurtling way beyond the speed of sound, shattering the\r\nsupersonic barriers, and faster and faster still....\r\n\r\nWhat happened to them? Nobody had figured it out. All the best brains\r\nin the world working on it might figure it out. But the brains were\r\nsplit up, divided into little camps here and there, getting a lot of\r\natomic spitballs ready to throw at one another, when teacher\'s back\r\nwas turned.\r\n\r\nSo it wasn\'t figured out, what happened to them. They had come a\r\nlong way since they first broke the barrier. Faster and faster and\r\nfaster--but they\'d hit a limit somewhere up there. And until they wiped\r\nout that limitation, the Moon was as far away as it had ever been back\r\nwhen man thought the canoe was a great discovery.\r\n\r\nThey just went faster and faster and faster--and then they disappeared.\r\nA curtain parted. A curtain closed. And wherever man wanted to get to\r\nso fast--he got there.\r\n\r\nThe yellow light blinked at Stevens like a jaundiced eye. Stevens\r\nwinked back with a mock gesture that was hardly genuine. The world\r\nrocked, and his head seemed to drain suddenly as though by a suction\r\npump.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHis task was simple enough. The controls were automatic until the\r\nsignal came for bringing the ship in, and then manual controls would be\r\nused. Until then, he served as only a slightly necessary human element.\r\nA voice. There was the radio, and his voice. He was to keep them\r\ninformed down there. Keep talking right up to the point when whatever\r\nhappened--happened.\r\n\r\nStevens talked. He reported the altitude, the velocity, the\r\ntemperature. He kept reporting as the three of them increased. His\r\neyes watched the light that might blink red. The "panic-light." When\r\nthat blinked, it meant curtains. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
It meant fire in the "Coffin." It\r\nmeant that if you were in a position to do it, you could use the\r\nautomatic pilot ejector and get hurled into the screaming currents by a\r\n37 mm cartridge that shot the pilot and cockpit straight up at 60 ft.\r\nper second.\r\n\r\nAt this altitude and this velocity, the ejector was useless.\r\n\r\nHe whispered, "Velocity--five thousand--" He spoke again.\r\n"Velocity--fifteen thousand--"\r\n\r\nIt was frightening. He flicked on the observation screen. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
It was a\r\nblur. He couldn\'t feel anything. He couldn\'t hear anything. If he could\r\nonly lift his legs, bend his knees. If he could only turn over on his\r\nside--\r\n\r\nHe opened his mouth to scream, and somehow prevented the burst that\r\nfrothed to soundless bubbles on his lips. His body seemed to swell,\r\nseeking to burst the Coffin\'s walls like a swelling mummy. The terror\r\nremained in him, icy and deep.\r\n\r\nHe watched the gauges creeping up and up. He was speaking. He knew he\r\nwas reporting but he couldn\'t hear himself saying anything. He watched\r\nthe "panic-light" that would glow red and that would be curtain time.\r\nThere was no sound. No sound at all. There was no vision. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
No awareness\r\nof motion. At this incredible height, at this frightening velocity,\r\nthere was no awareness of anything at all.\r\n\r\nHe was in a Coffin all right, and he was buried--as certainly as though\r\nhe were six feet under and as stationary as only the dead can be when\r\nthey are buried and forgotten down under the clean Earth where they\r\nbelong when they\'re tired.\r\n\r\nThey didn\'t belong up here, not this way.\r\n\r\n"The cooling system\'s clogging," he heard himself whisper. "Crystals of\r\nice ... cockpit\'s like a miniature snow storm...."\r\n\r\nHe heard the unemotional voice come clearly to him. "The emergency\r\ntrigger--"\r\n\r\nHe used it. He felt a freezing grin rip across his face as he reached\r\nout and used it. The icy spray died away and he heard himself saying\r\nsomething else.\r\n\r\n"It\'s the velocity. I don\'t have any reason for saying it--I just feel\r\nit--you could feel it up here too--I can\'t explain it, but it\'s the\r\nvelocity. I know it. Maybe they crashed on the Earth somewhere. There\'s\r\nlots of places on Earth a ship could crash and no one would know it,\r\nespecially when it would be taken for a meteor. But this feels like\r\nit\'s the velocity that does it up here. Listen, what about this? Anyone\r\nthought of this--what if the velocity breaks a man through into another\r\ndimension?"\r\n\r\nNo one commented on that. It happened to him right then, and he felt\r\nit coming. Reflexes tried to move his body, and his head and feet\r\ndrummed on the restricting tubular walls. There was a wrenching blur\r\nand a slipping spinning vertigo.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n... there was darkness and he floated in it, but he was conscious. It\r\nwasn\'t any familiar kind of consciousness. Lights began glimmering\r\nhere and there like fireflies. But it was no dream, he knew that.\r\nHe didn\'t know what it was. The music that was something far and\r\nincomprehensively beyond music sounded, and he seemed to float on\r\na broad tape of sound to float on a road, a path, a curvature that\r\nbroadened into unlimited vistas.\r\n\r\nIt was brief. It was like peeking through a tiny hole and seeing\r\nsomething beautiful, unworldly, very nearly incomprehensible, drift by.\r\nHe heard a voice that had no body, but he knew it was real, very real.\r\nMore real than anything he had called real before.\r\n\r\n"Another is coming through. Check the matrix."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe tried to understand. Vaporous curtains seemed to draw back one by\r\none and a kind of clarity flowed over his mind like cool ocean up a\r\nwhite beach. A first faint tingling thrill moved in his blood, and\r\nbecame pleasure that mounted through ecstasy and then became something\r\nelse for which he had no name.\r\n\r\nHe had called it--nowhere. This wasn\'t anything like that. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
This was\r\nreally _some_where. Soft lights bathed him like water. Shadows seemed\r\nto shift and sway and there was silver in the light, dusted with golden\r\nmotes.\r\n\r\nHe thought desperately. "Where is this? 

=== Chunk 10 ===
What has happened?"\r\n\r\n"This is Death," the voice that had no face or form answered. "That is\r\nwhat you term it, in the lower stage reality from which you have come.\r\nThere are other ways of going through the barrier, but death is the\r\nsure and the ordinary one. Many come through, in many ways--"\r\n\r\nStevens tried to understand, and he knew that he could not. He tried to\r\nsee his present form, his present meaning. There was nothing tangible.\r\nHe drifted. He was light and sound perhaps, movement perhaps. He was\r\npart of something greater and far more complex than his undeveloped\r\npowers of perception could absorb.\r\n\r\nStevens thought. "You mean--I\'m--Dead. I mean--that I\'m not living now?"\r\n\r\nThe thought answered him. It wasn\'t a sequence of words, phrases,\r\nforming meaning. The entire answer was a part of him, immediately. "You\r\ncall it death. Actually you are more alive, you have come through the\r\nbarrier into what you call the fourth dimension. It is really but a\r\nbroader awareness of a higher reality--"\r\n\r\nIt didn\'t mean much to Stevens. The unknown, the intangible--it sent a\r\nchill through his consciousness. Pain hit him. He winced. Light roiled,\r\nirritation eddied like muddy streaks in a clear stream. A bluish haze\r\nspread like staining ink through the clouds of brilliance. Dark cracks\r\nspread like lines through colored glass.\r\n\r\nStevens felt an icy wind. He seemed to swirl inchoate through a forest\r\nof wildly irritated leaves and branches.\r\n\r\nThe thought came to him, weakly, through distance that was more than\r\nmere distance, through barriers of space and realms of time. It came to\r\nhim weakly, and it began to fade.\r\n\r\n"Everything that was, that is, or will be, we are conscious of here in\r\nthis higher stage of reality. All must come through, and there is never\r\nagain contact with the lower stage, the third dimension of perception.\r\nThe matrix is universal, eternal, and it is set and unchanging."\r\n\r\nStevens\' mind screamed. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
"But I\'m returning--help me, I don\'t want to go\r\nback. I want to stay, to stay--"\r\n\r\n"You are John Stevens--" the voice, the thought, drifted to him from\r\nwhat seemed infinite spaces.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes--"\r\n\r\n"There is a distortion, you do not understand. Someday you will. 

=== Chunk 12 ===
You\r\nare premature. The pattern is rigid, and everything has its set moment\r\nof alteration. This distortion, I cannot explain. We are not perfect\r\nhere. There is yet a higher reality, and a higher one still, and the\r\nstages are infinite. But you will be back, John Stevens. Soon. Very\r\nsoon."\r\n\r\n"When--when?"\r\n\r\nA column of sound arose and shattered in glittering spray. "The matrix\r\nhas the answer. John Stevens--no this is not your time. You call it\r\na week. Seven days. Such terms are meaningless here. To us, it is\r\nhappening now. We can see it happening. We can see you coming through\r\nthe barrier--to stay--to learn--to live as we live--"\r\n\r\n"When?" he screamed at the fading thought.\r\n\r\n"Soon. A week. Seven days. It is here. The Matrix has the answer...."\r\n\r\n"Now. Let me stay," Stevens screamed. "I don\'t want to go back."\r\n\r\n"You are not really here, or you could not go back. This is a glimpse.\r\nMany have had it. 

=== Chunk 13 ===
Someday you will understand. But in seven days--"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe radio voice was shrill. "Can you hear? Can you hear? There has been\r\nfive seconds of unexplainable static! Can you hear?"\r\n\r\n"Sure, I can hear," he said hoarsely. He blinked, stared at the blurred\r\ninstruments against his eyes. Suddenly he shouted. "I\'m still alive,\r\nyou get that? I\'ve passed the velocity apex, and I\'m still alive!"\r\n\r\nHe heard Major Kanin\'s voice. Some of the fatuousness was lost in the\r\nemotion of triumph. "Great! Great, you\'ve done it! Now you\'ve got to\r\nbring her in! That pardon--"\r\n\r\nAll right. He would do that. He had been a super-boy, a jet-gyrene\r\nhimself, once. A big-shot, a wonder boy jet-hero, before he got that\r\njealous quirk that had turned out to be baseless. A feud that had gone\r\non for years and culminated in a fight, and Bill Carson had died from\r\nconcussion. There had been nothing between Doris and Carson, but it was\r\ntoo late to think about that now.\r\n\r\nThe Military had been harsh, and he\'d known he couldn\'t bear the\r\nconfinement. And he hadn\'t wanted Doris to suffer for his psychological\r\nblowup either. He had volunteered for what should have been\r\nsuicide--but he still lived. He couldn\'t understand that. He should be\r\nDead. He knew that. But he wasn\'t, and he knew he would bring her in. A\r\npardon--\r\n\r\nThe world was small for Stevens. A coffin, a cannon-barrel. And he was\r\nstuffed in it. His hands alone could move over the simple controls,\r\nand his eyes could move over the gauges. A jet-pilot had to learn\r\na special feel to bring in a jet-ship. And Stevens had learned that\r\n"feel" rapidly, years ago. It seemed a long time ago when he had taken\r\nthat harsh training: a few hours in a conventional flyer, a few more\r\nin a Mustang 60. Then that rending day when he had "checked out" in a\r\njet-trainer.\r\n\r\nStevens\' eyes bulged in sudden terror. Sweat blurred his vision. The\r\nred light was glowing. The _Panic-Light_. It meant bad trouble at this\r\nspeed. Fire--\r\n\r\n"But I\'ll bring it in," he whispered. Smoke curled through the Coffin.\r\nThe heat expanded around him rapidly. He thought of the ejector, but he\r\nwas too low now, coming in. He tried to scream. The crackling wavering\r\nheat inside his helmet was intolerable. The controls were jammed.\r\nHis hands fell away and he dropped his head helplessly and the world\r\nexploded....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis time there was a crowd, and they acted differently. They were\r\nenthusiastic. 

=== Chunk 14 ===
There were doctors and nurses. Their faces were twisted\r\nwith admiration. Stronger than the admiration was a fearful kind of\r\ndisbelief. The Doctor touched his lips with his tongue and coughed\r\nuneasily as he stared at Stevens.\r\n\r\nMajor Kanin was beaming. "Man," his voice boomed through the hospital\r\nroom. "Man! You\'re alive. No one knows how you can be alive, but you\r\nare! We\'ve licked it. It\'s a miracle!"\r\n\r\nVoices agreed with that in a chorus of incredulous whispers. Miracle....\r\n\r\nThe Major said, "I\'ve already got that pardon coming through, Stevens.\r\nIt\'ll be probational of course, but that will all be forgotten now,\r\nStevens. You\'re something special."\r\n\r\nThe doctors and nurses stared at him with unbelieving eyes.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve been examined thoroughly, Stevens, and you\'re all right, not\r\na scratch! It\'s impossible, but it\'s true. Every doctor here, every\r\nmechanic, says it\'s impossible. Your ship\'s just a pile of melting\r\nmetal, Stevens, but you crawled out of it absolutely uninjured. Nobody\r\nunderstands it, but everybody\'s glad!

=== Chunk 15 ===
"\r\n\r\nThe Doctor whispered. "Miracles like this sometimes happen, but no one\r\ncan explain them. His body should be torn to pieces, burned. Well, he\r\ncertainly had to have had some unique physical quality to have gotten\r\nthrough the high velocity peak."\r\n\r\n"Yes, you hear that, Stevens?" the Major boomed.\r\n\r\nStevens was staring at the ceiling. He was trying to think, to remember.\r\n\r\n"Now listen to this, Stevens. You went up a convict, and now you\'re a\r\nhero. You\'re in perfect physical condition, so we\'re going right ahead\r\nwith Project Ultimo. And you\'ll handle the rocket, Stevens! If anyone\r\ncan get to the Moon, you can, from this exhibition today!"\r\n\r\n"What\'s that," Stevens said. He looked at their faces.\r\n\r\n"It\'ll take a week to get the rocket ready," the Major said. "It\'s the\r\nMoon now, Stevens! The Moon!"\r\n\r\n"The Moon," Stevens repeated.\r\n\r\n"This will be no secret, Stevens!" Major Kanin stood up, his chest out,\r\nhis heavy-jowled face glowing with triumph. "The world will know about\r\nit when you take off, this time. This won\'t be secret. The Enemy will\r\nknow then that they\'ve lost! Lost, utterly and unquestionably. With\r\nmilitary bases on the Moon, they\'ll be helpless and they\'ll know it\r\nwhen you make that successful flight! One week, Stevens!"\r\n\r\nStevens looked out the window at the gray curtain of rain. "What was\r\nthat? One week--" Something stirred in his memory. He grappled for it,\r\nlost it. He closed his eyes.\r\n\r\n"Seven days, Stevens, that\'s all!"\r\n\r\nHe didn\'t answer. For an instant, behind the bottomless darkness of his\r\nclosed lids, he saw something--something intangible and shimmering,\r\nbeyond the grayness and rain. And then it was gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
