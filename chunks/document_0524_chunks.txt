=== Chunk 2 ===
This had been\r\ngoing on for 26 terrestrial years, which means from minus ten to plus\r\n280 in some of the others. The only place that didn\'t want him was\r\nEarth, his native planet, where he was too smart to operate--but, of\r\ncourse, the Galactic Police were looking for him there too, to deliver\r\nhim to the authorities of the other planets in accordance with the\r\nInterplanetary Constitution.\r\n\r\nFor all of those years, The Eel (which was his Earth monicker;\r\nelsewhere, he was known by names indicating equally squirmy and slimy\r\nlife-forms) had been gayly going his way, known under a dozen\r\ndifferent aliases, turning up suddenly here, there, everywhere,\r\ncommitting his gigantic depredations, and disappearing as quickly and\r\nsilently when his latest enterprise had succeeded. He specialized in\r\nenormous, unprecedented thefts. It was said that he despised stealing\r\nanything under the value of 100 million terrestrial units, and most of\r\nhis thefts were much larger than that.\r\n\r\nHe had no recognizable _modus operandi_, changing his methods with\r\neach new crime. He never left a clue. But, in bravado, he signed his\r\nname to every job: his monicker flattered him, and after each\r\nmalefaction the victim--usually a government agency, a giant\r\ncorporation, or one of the clan enterprises of the smaller\r\nplanets--would receive a message consisting merely of the impudent\r\ndepiction of a large wriggling eel.\r\n\r\nThey got him at last, of course. The Galactic Police, like the\r\nprehistoric Royal Canadian Mounted, have the reputation of always\r\ncatching their man. (Sometimes they don\'t catch him till he\'s dead,\r\nbut they catch him.) It took them 26 years, and it was a hard job, for\r\nThe Eel always worked alone and never talked afterward.\r\n\r\nThey did it by the herculean labor of investigating the source of the\r\nfortune of every inhabitant of Earth, since all that was known was\r\nthat The Eel was a terrestrial. Every computer in the Federation\r\nworked overtime analyzing the data fed into it. It wasn\'t entirely a\r\nthankless task, for, as a by-product, a lot of embezzlers, tax evaders\r\nand lesser robbers were turned up.\r\n\r\nIn the end, it narrowed down to one man who owned more than he could\r\naccount for having. Even so, they almost lost him, for his takings\r\nwere cached away under so many pseudonyms that it took several months\r\njust to establish that they all belonged to the same person. When that\r\nwas settled, the police swooped. The Eel surrendered quietly; the one\r\nthing he had been surest of was never being apprehended, and he was so\r\ndumfounded he was unable to put up any resistance.\r\n\r\nAnd then came the still greater question: which of the planets was to\r\nhave him?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nXystil said it had the first right because his theft there had been\r\nthe largest--a sum so huge, it could be expressed only by an algebraic\r\nindex. Artha\'s argument was that his first recorded crime had been on\r\nthat planet. Medoris wanted him because its only penalty for any\r\nfelony is an immediate and rather horrible death, and that would\r\nguarantee getting rid of The Eel forever.\r\n\r\nCeres put in a claim on the ground that it was the only planet or moon\r\nin the Sol System in which he had operated, and since he was a\r\nterrestrial, it was a matter for local jurisdiction. Eb pleaded that\r\nit was the newest and poorest member of the Galactic Federation, and\r\nshould have been protected in its inexperience against his\r\nthievishness.\r\n\r\nHa-Almirath argued that it had earned his custody because it was its\r\nChief Ruler who had suggested to the police the method which had\r\nresulted in his arrest. Vavinour countered that it should be the\r\nchosen recipient, since the theft there had included desecration of\r\nthe High Temple.\r\n\r\nLittle Agsk, which was only a probationary Galactic Associate,\r\nmodestly said that if it were given The Eel, its prompt and exemplary\r\npunishment might qualify it for full membership, and it would be\r\ngrateful for the chance.\r\n\r\nA special meeting of the Galactic Council had to be called for the\r\nsole purpose of deciding who got The Eel.\r\n\r\nRepresentatives of all the claimant planets made their\r\nrepresentations. Each told in eloquent detail why his planet and his\r\nalone was entitled to custody of the arch-criminal, and what they\r\nwould do to him when--not if--they got him. After they had all been\r\nheard, the councilors went into executive session, with press and\r\npublic barred. An indiscreet councilor (it was O-Al of Phlagon of\r\nAltair, if you want to know) leaked later some of the rather\r\nindecorous proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe Earth councilor, he reported, had been granted a voice but no\r\nvote, since Earth was not an interested party as to the crime, but\r\nonly as to the criminal. Every possible system of arbitration had been\r\ndiscussed--chronological, numerical in respect to the size of the\r\ntheft, legalistic in respect to whether the culprit would be available\r\nto hand on to another victim when the first had got through punishing\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIn the welter of claims and counterclaims, one harassed councilor\r\nwearily suggested a lottery. Another in desperation recommended\r\nhanding The Eel a list of prospective punishments on each of the eight\r\nplanets and observing which one seemed to inspire him with most\r\ndread--which would then be the one selected. One even proposed\r\npoisoning him and announcing his sudden collapse and death.\r\n\r\nThe sessions went on day and night; the exhausted councilors separated\r\nfor brief periods of sleep, then went at it again. A hung jury was\r\nunthinkable; something had to be decided. The news outlets of the\r\nentire Galaxy were beginning to issue sarcastic editorials about\r\nprocrastination and coddling criminals, with hints about bribery and\r\ncorruption, and remarks that perhaps what was needed was a few\r\nimpeachments and a new general election.\r\n\r\nSo at last, in utter despair, they awarded The Eel to Agsk, as a sort\r\nof bonus and incentive. Whichever planet they named, the other seven\r\nwere going to scream to high heaven, and Agsk was least likely to be\r\nable to retaliate against any expressions of indignation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAgskians, as everyone knows, are fairly humanoid beings, primitives\r\nfrom the outer edge of the Galaxy. They were like college freshmen\r\ninvited to a senior fraternity. This was their Big Chance to Make\r\nGood.\r\n\r\nThe Eel, taciturn as ever, was delivered to a delegation of six of\r\nthem sent to meet him in one of their lumbering spaceships, a low\r\ncountergrav machine such as Earth had outgrown several millennia\r\nbefore. They were so afraid of losing him that they put a metal belt\r\naround him with six chains attached to it, and fastened all six of\r\nthemselves to him. Once on Agsk, he was placed in a specially made\r\nstone pit, surrounded by guards, and fed through the only opening.\r\n\r\nIn preparation for the influx of visitors to the trial, an anticipated\r\ngreater assembly of off-planeters than little Agsk had ever seen, they\r\nevacuated their capital city temporarily, resettling all its citizens\r\nexcept those needed to serve and care for the guests, and remodeled\r\nthe biggest houses for the accommodation of those who had peculiar\r\nspace, shape, or other requirements.\r\n\r\nNever since the Galactic Federation was founded had so many beings,\r\nhuman, humanoid, semi-humanoid and non-humanoid, gathered at the same\r\ntime on any one member-planet. Every newstape, tridimens, audio and\r\nall other varieties of information services--even including the drum\r\namplifiers of Medoris and the ray-variants of Eb--applied for and were\r\ngranted a place in the courtroom. This, because no other edifice was\r\nlarge enough, was an immense stone amphitheater usually devoted to\r\nrather curious games with animals; since it rains on Agsk only for two\r\nspecified hours on every one of their days, no roof was needed. At\r\nevery seat, there was a translatophone, with interpreters ready in\r\nplastic cages to translate the Intergalactic in which the trial was\r\nconducted into even the clicks and hisses of Jorg and the eye-flashes\r\nof Omonro.\r\n\r\nAnd in the midst of all this, the cause and purpose of it all, sat the\r\nlegendary Eel.\r\n\r\nSeen at last, he was hardly an impressive figure. Time had been going\r\non and The Eel was in his fifties, bald and a trifle paunchy. He was\r\ncompletely ordinary in appearance, a circumstance which had, of\r\ncourse, enabled him to pass unobserved on so many planets; he looked\r\nlike a salesman or a minor official, and had indeed been so taken by\r\nthe unnoticing inhabitants of innumerable planets.\r\n\r\nPeople had wondered, when word came of some new outrage by this\r\nmaster-thief, if perhaps he had disguised himself as a resident of the\r\nscene of each fresh crime, but now it was obvious that this had not\r\nbeen necessary. He had been too clever to pick any planet where\r\nvisitors from Earth were not a common sight, and he had been too\r\ninsignificant for anyone to pay attention to him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe criminal code of Agsk is unique in the Galaxy, though there are\r\nrumors of something similar among a legendary extinct tribe on Earth\r\ncalled the Guanches. The high priest is also the chief executive (as\r\nwell as the minister of education and head of the medical faculty),\r\nand he rules jointly with a priestess who also officiates as chief\r\njudge.\r\n\r\nThe Agskians have some strange ideas to a terrestrial eye--for\r\nexample, suicide is an honor, and anyone of insufficient rank who\r\ncommits it condemns his immediate family to punishment for his\r\npresumption. They are great family people, in general. Also, they\r\nnever lie, and find it hard to realize that other beings do.\r\n\r\nMurder, to them, is merely a matter for negotiation between the\r\nmurderer and the relatives of the victim, provided it is open and\r\nwithout deceit. But grand larceny, since property is the foundation of\r\nthe family, is punished in a way that shows that the Agskians, though\r\ntechnologically primitive, are psychologically very advanced.\r\n\r\nThey reason that death, because it comes inevitably to all, is the\r\nleast of misfortunes. Lasting grief, remorse and guilt are the\r\ngreatest. So they let the thief live and do not even imprison him.\r\n\r\nInstead, they find out who it is that the criminal most loves. If they\r\ndo not know who it is, they merely ask him, and since Agskians never\r\nlie, he always tells them. Then they seize that person, and kill him\r\nor her, slowly and painfully, before the thief\'s eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd the agreement had been that The Eel was to be tried and punished\r\nby the laws and customs of the planet to which he was awarded.\r\n\r\nThe actual trial and conviction of The Eel were almost perfunctory.\r\nWithout needing to resort to torture, his jailers had been presented,\r\non a platter as it were, with a full confession--so far as the\r\nparticular robbery he had committed on Agsk was concerned. There is a\r\nprovision for defense in the Agskian code, but it was unneeded because\r\nThe Eel had pleaded guilty.\r\n\r\nBut he knew very well he would not be executed by the Agskians; he\r\nwould instead be set free (presumably with a broken heart) to be\r\nhanded over to the next claimant--and that, the Council had decided,\r\nwould be Medoris. Since Medoris always kills its criminals, that would\r\nend the whole controversy.\r\n\r\nSo the Eel was quite aware that his conviction by Agsk would be only\r\nthe preliminary to an exquisitely painful and lingering demise at the\r\ntwo-clawed hands of the Medorans. His business was somehow to get out\r\nfrom under.\r\n\r\nNaturally, the resources of the Galactic Police had been at the full\r\ndisposal of the officials of Agsk.\r\n\r\nThe files had been opened, and the Agskians had before them The Eel\'s\r\nhistory back to the day of his birth. He himself had been questioned,\r\nencelographed, hypnotized, dormitized, injected, psychographed,\r\nsubjected to all the means of eliciting information devised by all\r\neight planets--for the other seven, once their first resentment was\r\nover, had reconciled themselves and cooperated whole-heartedly with\r\nAgsk.\r\n\r\nMedoris especially had been of the greatest help. The Medorans could\r\nhardly wait.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the spate of news of the trial that inundated every portion of the\r\nGalaxy, there began to be discovered a note of sympathy for this one\r\nlittle creature arrayed against the mightiest powers of the Galaxy.\r\nPoor people who wished they had his nerve, and romantic people who\r\ndreamed of adventures they would never dare perform, began to say that\r\nThe Eel wasn\'t so bad, after all; he became a symbol of the rebellious\r\nindividual thumbing his nose at entrenched authority. Students of\r\nEarth prehistory will recognize such symbols in the mythical Robin\r\nHood and Al Capone.\r\n\r\nThese were the people who were glad to put up when bets began to be\r\nmade. At first the odds were ten to one against The Eel; then, as time\r\ndragged by, they dropped until it was even money.\r\n\r\nAgsk itself began to be worried. It was one thing to make a big,\r\nexpensive splurge to impress the Galaxy and to hasten its acceptance\r\ninto full membership in the Federation, but nobody had expected the\r\nshow to last more than a few days. If it kept on much longer, Agsk\r\nwould be bankrupt.\r\n\r\nFor the trial had foundered on one insoluble problem: the only way The\r\nEel could ever be punished by their laws was to kill the person he\r\nmost loved--and nobody could discover that he had ever loved anybody.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHis mother? His father? 

=== Chunk 3 ===
He had been an undutiful and unaffectionate\r\nson, and his parents were long since dead in any case. He had never\r\nhad a brother, a sister, a wife or a child. No probing could find any\r\nwoman with whom he had ever been in love. He had never had an intimate\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nHe did nothing to help, naturally. He simply sat in his chains and\r\nsmiled and waited. He was perfectly willing to be escorted from the\r\ncourt every evening, relieved of his fetters and placed in his pit. It\r\nwas a much pleasanter existence than being executed inch by inch by\r\nthe Medorans. For all he cared, the Agskians could go on spending\r\ntheir planetary income until he finally died of old age.\r\n\r\nThe priestess-judge and her co-adjutors wore themselves out in\r\ndiscussions far into the night. They lost up to 15 pounds apiece,\r\nwhich on Agsk, where the average weight of adults is about 40, was\r\nserious. It began to look as if The Eel\'s judges would predecease him.\r\n\r\n_Whom_ did The Eel love? They went into minutiae and subterfuges. He\r\nhad never had a pet to which he was devoted. He had never even loved a\r\nhouse which could be razed. He could not be said to have loved the\r\nimmense fortune he had stolen, for he had concealed his wealth and\r\nused little of it, and in any event it had all been confiscated and,\r\nso far as possible, restored proportionately to those he had robbed.\r\n\r\nWhat he had loved most, doubtless, was his prowess in stealing\r\nunimaginable sums and getting away with it--but there is no way of\r\n"killing" a criminal technique.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlmost a year had passed. Agsk was beginning to wish The Eel had never\r\nbeen caught, or that they had never been awarded the glory of trying\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAt last the priestess-judge, in utter despair, took off her judge\'s\r\nrobes, put on the cassock and surplice of her sacred calling, and laid\r\nthe problem before the most unapproachable and august of the gods of\r\nAgsk.\r\n\r\nThe trial was suspended while she lay for three days in a trance on\r\nthe high altar. She emerged weak and tottering, her skin light blue\r\ninstead of its healthy purple, but her head high and her mouth curved\r\nin triumph.\r\n\r\nAt sight of her, renewed excitement surged through the audience.\r\nNews-gatherers, who had been finding it difficult of late to get\r\nanything to report, rushed to their instruments.\r\n\r\n"Remove the defendant\'s chains and set him free," the priestess-judge\r\nordered in ringing tones. "The Great God of the Unspeakable Name has\r\nrevealed to me whom the defendant most loves. As soon as he is freed,\r\nseize him and slay him. For the only being he loves is--himself.

=== Chunk 4 ===
"\r\n\r\nThere was an instant\'s silence, and then a roar. The Medorans howled\r\nin frustration.\r\n\r\nBut The Eel, still guarded but unchained, stood up and laughed aloud.\r\n\r\n"Your Great God is a fool!" he said blasphemously. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
"I deny that I love\r\nmyself. I care nothing for myself at all."\r\n\r\nThe priestess-judge sighed. "Since this is your sworn denial, it must\r\nbe true," she said. "So then we cannot kill you. Instead, we grant\r\nthat you do indeed love no one. Therefore you are a creature so far\r\noutside our comprehension that you cannot come under our laws, no\r\nmatter how you have broken them. We shall notify the Federation that\r\nwe abandon our jurisdiction and hand you over to our sister-planet\r\nwhich is next in line to judge you."\r\n\r\nThen all the viewers on tridimens on countless planets saw something\r\nthat nobody had ever thought to see--The Eel\'s armor of\r\nself-confidence cracked and terror poured through the gap.\r\n\r\nHe dropped to his knees and cried: "Wait! Wait! 

=== Chunk 6 ===
I confess that I\r\nblasphemed your god, but without realizing that I did!"\r\n\r\n"You mean," pressed the priestess-judge, "you acknowledge that you\r\nyourself are the only being dear to you?"\r\n\r\n"No, not that, either. Until now, I have never known love. But now it\r\nhas come upon me like a nova and I must speak the truth." He paused,\r\nstill on his knees, and looked piteously at the priestess-judge.\r\n"Are--are you bound by your law to--to believe me and to kill, instead\r\nof me, this--this being I adore?"\r\n\r\n"We are so bound," she stated.\r\n\r\n"Then," said The Eel, smiling and confident again, rising to his feet,\r\n"before all the Galaxy, I must declare the object of my sudden but\r\neverlasting passion. Great lady, it is you!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Eel is still in his pit, which has been made most comfortable by\r\nhis sympathizers, while the Council of the Galactic Federation seeks\r\nfeverishly and vainly, year after year, to find some legal way out of\r\nthe impasse.\r\n\r\nAgsk, however, requests all Federation citizens to submit solutions,\r\nthe grand prize for a workable answer being a lifetime term as\r\npresident of the planet. A secondary contest (prize: lifetime\r\nambassadorship to the Galactic Federation) is offered for a legal way\r\naround the statute barring criminals (specifically The Eel) from\r\nentering the primary contest.\r\n\r\n                                                   --MIRIAM ALLEN DeFORD\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
