It was\r\nspherical, the estimated diameter about twenty-seven miles, and was in\r\nan orbit approximately 3400 miles from the surface of the Earth. No one\r\nobserved the escape from it.\r\n\r\nThe ship itself occasioned some excitement, but back there at the\r\ntattered end of the 20th century, what was one visiting spaceship more\r\nor less? Others had appeared before, and gone away discouraged--or just\r\nnot bothering. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
3-dimensional TV was coming out of the experimental\r\nstage. Soon anyone could have Dora the Doll or the Grandson of Tarzan\r\nsmack in his own living-room. Besides, it was a hot summer.\r\n\r\nThe first knowledge of the escape came when the region of Seattle\r\nsuffered an eclipse of the sun, which was not an eclipse but a near\r\nshadow, which was not a shadow but a thing. The darkness drifted out of\r\nthe northern Pacific. It generated thunder without lightning and without\r\nrain. When it had moved eastward and the hot sun reappeared, wind\r\nfollowed, a moderate gale. The coast was battered by sudden high waves,\r\nthen hushed in a bewilderment of fog.\r\n\r\nBefore that appearance, radar had gone crazy for an hour.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere buzzed with aircraft. They went up in readiness to shoot,\r\nbut after the first sighting reports only a few miles offshore, that\r\norder was vehemently canceled--someone in charge must have had a grain\r\nof sense. The thing was not a plane, rocket or missile. It was an\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nIf you shoot an animal that resembles an inflated gas-bag with wings,\r\nand the wingspread happens to be something over four miles tip to tip,\r\nand the carcass drops on a city--it\'s not nice for the city.\r\n\r\nThe Office of Continental Defense deplored the lack of precedent. But\r\nactually none was needed. You just don\'t drop four miles of dead or\r\ndying alien flesh on Seattle or any other part of a swarming homeland.\r\nYou wait till it flies out over the ocean, if it will--the most\r\ncommodious ocean in reach.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt, or rather she, didn\'t go back over the Pacific, perhaps because of\r\nthe prevailing westerlies. After the Seattle incident she climbed to a\r\ngreat altitude above the Rockies, apparently using an updraft with very\r\nlittle wing-motion. There was no means of calculating her weight, or\r\nmass, or buoyancy. Dead or injured, drift might have carried her\r\nanywhere within one or two hundred miles. Then she seemed to be\r\nfollowing the line of the Platte and the Missouri. By the end of the day\r\nshe was circling interminably over the huge complex of St. Louis,\r\nhopelessly crying.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nShe had a head, drawn back most of the time into the bloated mass of the\r\nbody but thrusting forward now and then on a short neck not more than\r\nthree hundred feet in length. When she did that the blunt turtle-like\r\nhead could be observed, the gaping, toothless, suffering mouth from\r\nwhich the thunder came, and the soft-shining purple eyes that searched\r\nthe ground but found nothing answering her need. The skin-color was\r\nmud-brown with some dull iridescence and many peculiar marks resembling\r\nweals or blisters. Along the belly some observers saw half a mile of\r\npaired protuberances that looked like teats.\r\n\r\nShe was unquestionably the equivalent of a vertebrate. Two web-footed\r\nlegs were drawn up close against the cigar-shaped body. The vast, rather\r\nnarrow, inflated wings could not have been held or moved in flight\r\nwithout a strong internal skeleton and musculature. Theorists later\r\nargued that she must have come from a planet with a high proportion of\r\nwater surface, a planet possibly larger than Earth though of about the\r\nsame mass and with a similar atmosphere. She could rise in Earth\'s air.\r\nAnd before each thunderous lament she was seen to breathe.\r\n\r\nIt was assumed that immense air sacs within her body were inflated or\r\npartly inflated when she left the ship, possibly with some gas lighter\r\nthan nitrogen. Since it was inconceivable that a vertebrate organism\r\ncould have survived entry into atmosphere from an orbit 3400 miles up,\r\nit was necessary to believe that the ship had briefly descended,\r\nunobserved and by unknown means, probably on Earth\'s night-side. Later\r\non the ship did descend as far as atmosphere, for a moment ...\r\n\r\nSt. Louis was partly evacuated. There is no reliable estimate of the\r\nloss of life and property from panic and accident on the jammed roads\r\nand rail lines. 1500 dead, 7400 injured is the conservative figure.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a night and a day she abandoned that area, flying heavily\r\neastward. The droning and swooping gnats of aircraft plainly distressed\r\nher. At first she had only tried to avoid them, but now and then during\r\nher eastward flight from St. Louis she made short desperate rushes\r\nagainst them, without skill or much sign of intelligence, screaming from\r\na wide-open mouth that could have swallowed a four-engine bomber. Two\r\naircraft were lost over Cincinnati, by collision with each other in\r\ntrying to get out of her way. Pilots were then ordered to keep a\r\ndistance of not less than ten miles until such time as she reached the\r\nAtlantic--if she did--when she could safely be shot down.\r\n\r\nShe studied Chicago for a day.\r\n\r\nBy that time Civil Defense was better prepared. About a million\r\nresidents had already fled to open country before she came, and the loss\r\nof life was proportionately smaller.

She moved on. We have no clue to\r\nthe reason why great cities should have attracted her, though\r\napparently they did. She was hungry perhaps, or seeking help, or merely\r\ndrawn in animal curiosity by the endless motion of the cities and the\r\nstrangeness. It has even been suggested that the life forms of her\r\nhomeland--her masters--resembled humanity. She moved eastward, and\r\nreligious organizations united to pray that she would come down on one\r\nof the lakes where she could safely be destroyed. She didn\'t.\r\n\r\nShe approached Pittsburgh, choked and screamed and flew high, and soared\r\nin weary circles over Buffalo for a day and a night. Some pilots who had\r\nfollowed the flight from the West Coast claimed that the vast\r\nlamentation of her voice was growing fainter and hoarser while she was\r\ndrifting along the line of the Mohawk Valley. She turned south,\r\nfollowing the Hudson at no great height. Sometimes she appeared to be\r\nchoking, the labored inhalations harsh and prolonged, like a cloud in\r\nagony.\r\n\r\nWhen she was over Westchester, headquarters tripled the swarm of\r\ninterceptors and observation planes. Squadrons from Connecticut and\r\nsouthern New Jersey deployed to form a monstrous funnel, the small end\r\nbefore her, the large end pointing out to open sea. Heavy bombers closed\r\nin above, laying a smoke screen at 10,000 feet to discourage her from\r\nrising. The ground shook with the drone of jets, and with her crying.\r\n\r\nMultitudes had abandoned the metropolitan area. Other multitudes trusted\r\nto the subways, to the narrow street canyons and to the strength of\r\nconcrete and steel. Others climbed to a thousand high places and\r\nwatched, trusting the laws of chance.\r\n\r\nShe passed over Manhattan in the evening--between 8:14 and 8:27 P.M.,\r\nJuly 16, 1976--at an altitude of about 2000 feet. She swerved away from\r\nthe aircraft that blanketed Long Island and the Sound, swerved again as\r\nthe southern group buzzed her instead of giving way. She made no attempt\r\nto rise into the sun-crimsoned terror of drifting smoke.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plan was intelligent. It should have worked, but for one fighter\r\npilot who jumped the gun.\r\n\r\nHe said later that he himself couldn\'t understand what happened. It was\r\ncourt-martial testimony, but his reputation had been good. He was Bill\r\nGreen--William Hammond Green--of New London, Connecticut, flying a\r\none-man jet fighter, well aware of the strictest orders not to attack\r\nuntil the target had moved at least ten miles east of Sandy Hook. He\r\nsaid he certainly had no previous intention to violate orders. It was\r\nsomething that just happened in his mind. A sort of mental sneeze.\r\n\r\nHis squadron was approaching Rockaway, the flying creature about three\r\nmiles ahead of him and half a mile down. He was aware of saying out loud\r\nto nobody: "Well, she\'s too big." Then he was darting out of formation,\r\ndiving on her, giving her one rocket-burst and reeling off to the south\r\nat 840 MPH.\r\n\r\nHe never did locate or rejoin his squadron, but he made it somehow back\r\nto his home field. He climbed out of the cockpit, they say, and fell\r\nflat on his face.\r\n\r\nIt seems likely that his shot missed the animal\'s head and tore through\r\nsome part of her left wing. She spun to the left, rose perhaps a\r\nthousand feet, facing the city, sideslipped, recovered herself and\r\nfought for altitude. She could not gain it. In the effort she collided\r\nwith two of the following planes. One of them smashed into her right\r\nside behind the wing, the other flipped end over end across her back,\r\nlike a swatted dragonfly. It dropped clear and made a mess on Bedloe\'s\r\nIsland.\r\n\r\nShe too was falling, in a long slant, silent now but still living. After\r\nthe impact her body thrashed desolately on the wreckage between\r\nLexington and Seventh Avenues, her right wing churning, then only\r\ntrailing, in the East River, her left wing a crumpled slowly deflating\r\nmass concealing Times Square, Herald Square and the garment district.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the struggle her neck extended, her turtle beak grasping\r\nthe top of Radio City. She was still trying to pull herself up, as the\r\nbuoyant gasses hissed and bubbled away through the gushing holes in her\r\nside. Radio City collapsed with her.\r\n\r\nFor a long while after the roar of descending rubble and her own roaring\r\nhad ceased, there was no human noise except a melancholy thunder of the\r\nplanes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe apology came early next morning.\r\n\r\nThe spaceship was observed to descend to the outer limits of atmosphere,\r\nvery briefly. A capsule was released, with a parachute timed to open at\r\n40,000 feet and come down quite neatly in Scarsdale. Parachute, capsule\r\nand timing device were of good workmanship.\r\n\r\nThe communication engraved on a plaque of metal (which still defies\r\nanalysis) was a hasty job, the English slightly odd, with some evidence\r\nof an incomplete understanding of the situation. That the visitors were\r\nthemselves aware of these deficiencies is indicated by the text of the\r\nmessage itself.\r\n\r\n      Most sadly regret inexcusable escape of livestock. While\r\n      petting same, one of our children monkied (sp?) with airlock.\r\n      Will not happen again. Regret also imperfect grasp of\r\n      language, learned through what you term Television etc.\r\n      Animal not dangerous, but observe some accidental damage\r\n      caused, therefore hasten to enclose reimbursement, having\r\n      taken liberty of studying your highly ingenious methods of\r\n      exchange. Hope same will be adequate, having estimated\r\n      deplorable inconvenience to best of ability. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Regret\r\n      exceedingly impossibility of communicating further, as\r\n      pressure of time and prior obligations forbids. Please accept\r\n      heartfelt apologies and assurances of continuing esteem.\r\n\r\nThe reimbursement was in fact properly enclosed with the plaque, and may\r\nbe seen by the public in the rotunda of the restoration of Radio City.\r\nThough technically counterfeit, it looks like perfectly good money,\r\nexcept that Mr. Lincoln is missing one of his wrinkles and the words\r\n"FIVE DOLLARS" are upside down.\r\n\r\n\r\n  --EDGAR PANGBORN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
