A week later, she returned with the finished drawing.\r\n    "The hero," she said. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
We did a double take. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
"Hey! That\'s not the\r\n    hero." She looked us straight in the eye. "Can you prove it?" She\r\n    had us. We couldn\'t, and she left hurriedly to go home and cook\r\n    dinner for her family. And what were they having? Frog legs--what\r\n    else?_\r\n\r\n\r\nThey were in the garden. "Now, Zoe," said Zenia Hawkins to her\r\nnine-year-old daughter, "quit fluttering around, and papa will tell you\r\na story."\r\n\r\nZoe settled down in the hammock. "A true story, papa?"\r\n\r\n"It all happened exactly like I\'m going to tell you," said Drake\r\nHawkins, pinching Zoe\'s rosy cheek. "Now: two thousand and eleven years\r\nago in 1985, figuring by the earthly calendar of that time, a tribe of\r\nbeings from the Dog-star Sirius invaded the earth."\r\n\r\n"And what did these beings look like, father?"\r\n\r\n"Like humans in many, many respects. They each had two arms, two legs\r\nand all the other organs that humans are endowed with."\r\n\r\n"Wasn\'t there any difference at all between the Star-beings and the\r\nhumans, papa?"\r\n\r\n"There was. The newcomers, each and all, had a pair of wings covered\r\nwith green feathers growing from their shoulders, and long, purple\r\ntails."\r\n\r\n"How many of these beings were there, father?"\r\n\r\n"Exactly three million and forty-one male adults and three female\r\nadults. These creatures first appeared on Earth on the island of\r\nSardinia. In five weeks\' time they were the masters of the entire\r\nglobe."\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t the Earth-lings fight back, papa?"\r\n\r\n"The humans warred against the invaders, using bullets, ordinary\r\nbombs, super-atom bombs and gases."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Illustrator: A. Lake]\r\n\r\n"What were those things like, father?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, they\'ve passed out of existence long ago. \'Ammunition\' they were\r\ncalled. The humans fought each other with such things."\r\n\r\n"And not with ideas, like we do now, father?"\r\n\r\n"No, with guns, just like I told you. But the invaders were immune to\r\nthe ammunition."\r\n\r\n"What does \'immune\' mean?"\r\n\r\n"Proof against harm. Then the humans tried germs and bacteria against\r\nthe star-beings."\r\n\r\n"What were those things?"\r\n\r\n"Tiny, tiny bugs that the humans tried to inject into the bodies of the\r\ninvaders to make them sicken and die. But the bugs had no effect at all\r\non the star-beings."\r\n\r\n"Go on, papa. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
These beings over-ran all Earth. Go on from there."\r\n\r\n"You must know, these newcomers were vastly more intelligent than the\r\nEarth-lings. In fact, the invaders were the greatest mathematicians in\r\nthe System."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the System? And what does mathematician mean?"\r\n\r\n"The Milky Way. A mathematician is one who is good at figuring,\r\nweighing, measuring, clever with numbers."\r\n\r\n"Then, father, the invaders killed off all the Earth-lings?

=== Chunk 5 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Not all. They killed many, but many others were enslaved. Just as the\r\nhumans had used horses and cattle, the newcomers so used the humans.\r\nThey made workers out of some, others they slaughtered for food."\r\n\r\n"Papa, what sort of language did these Star-beings talk?"\r\n\r\n"A very simple language, but the humans were never able to master it.\r\nSo, the invaders, being so much smarter, mastered all the languages of\r\nthe globe."\r\n\r\n"What did the Earth-lings call the invaders, father?"\r\n\r\n"\'An-vils\'. Half angels, half devils."\r\n\r\n"Then, papa, everything was peaceful on Earth after the An-vils enslaved\r\nthe humans?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"For a little while. Then, some of the most daring of the humans, led by\r\na man named Knowall, escaped into the interior of Greenland. This\r\nKnowall was a psychiatrist, the foremost on Earth."\r\n\r\n"What\'s a psychiatrist?"\r\n\r\n"A dealer in ideas."\r\n\r\n"Then, he was very rich?"\r\n\r\n"He\'d been the richest human on Earth. After some profound thought,\r\nKnowall figured a way to rid the earth of the An-vils."\r\n\r\n"How, papa?"\r\n\r\n"He perfected a method, called the Knowall-Hughes, Ilinski technique, of\r\nimbuing these An-vils with human emotions."\r\n\r\n"What does \'imbuing\' mean?"\r\n\r\n"He filled them full of and made them aware of."\r\n\r\nZenia interrupted, "Aren\'t you talking a bit above the child\'s\r\nunderstanding, Drake?"\r\n\r\n"No, mama," said Zoe. "I understand what papa explained. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Now, don\'t\r\ninterrupt."\r\n\r\n"So, Knowall," continued Drake, "filled the An-vils with human feelings\r\nsuch as Love, Hate, Ambition, Jealousy, Malice, Envy, Despair, Hope,\r\nFear, Shame and so on. Very soon the An-vils were acting like humans,\r\nand in ten days, terrible civil wars wiped out the An-vils\' population\r\nby two-thirds."\r\n\r\n"Then, papa, the An-vils finally killed off each other?"\r\n\r\n"Almost, until among them a being named Zalibar, full of saintliness and\r\npersuasion, preached the brotherhood of all An-vils. The invaders,\r\nquickly converted, quit their quarrels, and the Earth-lings were even\r\nmore enslaved."\r\n\r\n"Oh, papa, weren\'t Knowall and his followers in Greenland awfully sad\r\nthe way things had turned out?"\r\n\r\n"For a while. Then Knowall came up with the final pay-off."\r\n\r\n"Is that slang, papa? Pay-off?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. The coup-de-grace. The ace in the hole that he\'d saved, if all\r\nelse failed."\r\n\r\n"I understand, papa. The idea that would out-trump anything the other\r\nside had to offer. What was it, father? 

=== Chunk 7 ===
What did they have?"\r\n\r\n"Knowall imbued the An-vils with nostalgia."\r\n\r\n"What is nostalgia?"\r\n\r\n"Home sickness."\r\n\r\n"Oh, papa, wasn\'t Knowall smart? That meant, the An-vils were all filled\r\nwith the desire to fly back to the star from where they had started."\r\n\r\n"Exactly. So, one day, all the An-vils, an immense army, flapping their\r\ngreat green wings, assembled in the Black Hills of North America, and,\r\nat a given signal, they all rose up from Earth and all the humans\r\nchanted, \'Glory, glory, the day of our deliverance!\'"\r\n\r\n"So then, father, all the An-vils flew away from Earth?"\r\n\r\n"Not all. There were two child An-vils, one male and one female, aged\r\ntwo years, who had been born on Earth, and they started off with all the\r\nother An-vils and flew up into the sky. But when they reached the upper\r\nlimits of the strato-sphere, they hesitated, turned tail and fluttered\r\nback to Earth where they had been born. Their names were Zizzo and\r\nZizza."\r\n\r\n"And what happened to Zizzo and Zizza, papa?"\r\n\r\n"Well, like all the An-vils, they were great mathematicians. So, they\r\nmultiplied."\r\n\r\n"Oh, papa," laughed Zoe, flapping her wings excitedly, "that was a very\r\nnice story!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ Oct.-Nov. 1953.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.
