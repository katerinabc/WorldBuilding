Earth Flight 21 was a\r\n              suicide run, a coffin ship, they told him.\r\n            Uranian death lay athwart the space lanes. But\r\n              Shano already knew this was his last ride.\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n                       Planet Stories Fall 1949.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMercurian night settled black and thick over the Q City Spaceport.\r\nTentative fingers of light flicked and probed the sky, and winked out.\r\n\r\n"Here she comes," somebody in the line ahead said.\r\n\r\nShano coughed, his whole skeletal body jerking. Arthritic joints sent\r\nflashes of pain along his limbs. Here she comes, he thought, feeling\r\nneither glad nor sad.\r\n\r\nHe coughed and slipped polarized goggles over his eyes.\r\n\r\nThe spaceport emerged bathed in infra red. Hangars, cradles, freighter\r\ncatapults and long runways stood out in sharp, diamond-clear detail.\r\nHigh up, beyond the cone of illumination, a detached triple row of\r\nbright specks--portholes of the liner _Stardust_--sank slowly down.\r\n\r\nThere was no eagerness in him. Only a tiredness. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
A relief. Relief from\r\na lifetime of beating around the planets. A life of digging, lifting,\r\nlugging and pounding. Like a work-worn Martian camel, he was going home\r\nto die.\r\n\r\nAs though on oiled pistons the ship sank into the light, its long\r\nshark-like hull glowing soft and silvery, and settled with a feathery\r\nsnuggle into the cradle\'s ribs.\r\n\r\nThe passenger line quivered as a loud-speaker boomed:\r\n\r\n"_Stardust, now arrived at Cradle Six! Stardust, Cradle Six! All\r\npassengers for Venus and Earth prepare to board in ten minutes._"\r\n\r\nShano coughed, and wiped phlegm from his thin lips, his hand following\r\naround the bony contours of his face, feeling the hollows and the beard\r\nstubble and loose skin of his neck. He coughed and thought of the\r\nvanium mines of Pluto, and his gum-clogged lungs. A vague, pressing\r\ndesire for home overwhelmed him. It had been so long.\r\n\r\n"_Attention! Attention, Stardust passengers! The signal is red. The\r\nsignal is red. Refunds now being made. Refunds now. Take-off in five\r\nminutes._"\r\n\r\nThe man ahead swore and flicked up an arm. "Red," he groaned. "By the\r\ninfinite galaxies, this is the last straw!" He charged away, knocking\r\nShano aside as he passed.\r\n\r\n_Red signal._ In bewildered anxiety Shano lifted the goggles from his\r\neyes and stared into the sudden blackness. The red signal. Danger out\r\nthere. Passengers advised to ground themselves, or travel at their own\r\nrisk.\r\n\r\nHe felt the passengers bump and fumble past him, grumbling vexatiously.\r\n\r\nA hot dread assailed him, and he coughed, plucking at his chest.\r\nPlucking at an urgency there.\r\n\r\nDropping the goggles to his rheumy eyes, he saw that the passenger line\r\nhad dissolved. He moved, shuffling, to the gate, thrust his ticket into\r\nthe scanner slot, and pushed through the turnstile when it clicked.\r\n\r\n"_Flight twenty-one, now arriving from Venus_," the loud-speaker said\r\nmonotonously. Shano glanced briefly upward and saw the gleaming belly\r\nof twenty-one sinking into the spaceport cone of light.\r\n\r\nHe clawed his way up the gangway and thrust out his ticket to the\r\nlieutenant standing alone at the air lock. The lieutenant, a sullen,\r\nchunky man with a queer nick in his jawbone, refused the ticket.\r\n"Haven\'t you heard, mister? Red signal. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Go on back."\r\n\r\nShano coughed, and peered through the lenses of his goggles. "Please,"\r\nhe said. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
"Want to go home. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
I\'ve a right." The nicked jaw stirred faint\r\nmemories within his glazed mind.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant punched his ticket. "It\'s your funeral, old man."\r\n\r\nThe loud-speaker blared. "_Stardust, taking off in thirty seconds. The\r\nsignal is red. Stardust, taking--_"\r\n\r\nWith the words dinning in his ears, Shano stepped into the air lock.\r\nThe officer followed, spun wheels, and the lock closed. The outside was\r\nshut off.\r\n\r\nLifting goggles they entered the hull, through a series of two more\r\nlocks, closing each behind them.\r\n\r\n"We\'re afloat," the officer said. "We\'ve taken off." 

=== Chunk 6 ===
A fleck of light\r\ndanced far back in his eye. Shano felt the pressure of acceleration\r\ngradually increasing, increasing, and hurried in.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCaptain Menthlo, a silver-mustached Jupiterian, broad, huge, yet\r\ncrushable as a beetle, talked while his hands manipulated a panel of\r\nstuds in the control room. The pilot, his back encased in leather, sat\r\nin a bucket seat before him, listening into earphones.\r\n\r\n"Surprised to learn of a passenger aboard," the captain said, glancing\r\nbriefly sideways. "You\'re entitled to know of the danger ahead." He\r\nflicked a final stud, spoke to the pilot and at last turned a serious,\r\nsquared face to Shano. "Old man," he said. "There\'s a Uranian fleet out\r\nthere. We don\'t know how many ships in this sector. Flight twenty-one,\r\nwhich just landed, had a skirmish with one, and got away. We may not be\r\nso lucky. You know how these Uranian devils are."\r\n\r\nShano coughed, and wiped his mouth. "Dirty devils," he said. "I was\r\ndriv\' off the planet once, before this war started. I know things\r\nabout them Uranian devils. Heard them in the mines around. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Hears\r\nthings, a laborer does."\r\n\r\nThe captain seemed for the first time to realize the social status of\r\nhis lone passenger, and he became a little gruff.\r\n\r\n"Want you to sign this waiver, saying you\'re traveling at your own\r\nrisk. We\'ll expect you to keep to your cabin as much as possible.\r\nWhen the trouble comes we can\'t bother with a passenger. In a few\r\nhours we\'ll shut down the ship entirely, and every mechanical device\r\naboard, to try to avoid detection." His mustaches rose like two spears\r\nfrom each side of his squared nose as his face changed to an alert\r\nwatchfulness. "Going home, eh?" he said. "You\'ve knocked around some,\r\nby the looks of you. Pluto, from the sound of that cough."\r\n\r\nShano scrawled his signature on the waiver. "Yeah," he said. "Pluto.\r\nWhere a man\'s lungs fights gas." He blinked watery eyes. "Captain,\r\nwhat\'s a notched jaw mean to you?"\r\n\r\n"Well, old man," the captain grasped Shano\'s shoulder and turned him\r\naround. "It means somebody cut himself, shaving. You stick tight to\r\nyour cabin." He nodded curtly and indicated the door.\r\n\r\nDescending the companionway to the next deck Shano observed the\r\nnick-jawed lieutenant staring out the viewport, apparently idling. The\r\nman turned and gripped Shano\'s thin arm.\r\n\r\n"A light?" he said, tapping a cigarette. Shano produced a lighter\r\ndisk and the chunky man puffed. He was an Earthman and his jaw seemed\r\ncut with a knife, notched like a piece of wood. Across the breast of\r\nhis tunic was a purple band, with the name _Rourke_. "Why are you so\r\nanxious to get aboard, old man?" He searched Shano\'s face. "There\'s\r\ntrouble ahead, you know."\r\n\r\nShano coughed, wracking his body, as forgotten memories stirred\r\nsluggishly in his mind. "Yup," he said, and jerked free and stumbled\r\ndown the steel deck.\r\n\r\nIn his cabin he lay on the bunk, lighted a cigarette and smoked,\r\ncoughing and staring at the rivet-studded bulkhead. The slow movement\r\nof his mind resolved into a struggle, one idea groping for the other.\r\n\r\nWhat were the things he\'d heard about nicked jaws? And where had\r\nhe heard them? Digging ore on Pluto; talk in the pits? Secretive\r\nsuspicions voiced in smoke-laden saloons of Mars? In the labor gangs of\r\nUranus? Where? Shano smoked and didn\'t know. But he knew there was a\r\nrumor, and that it was the talk of ignorant men. The captain had evaded\r\nit. Shano smoked and coughed and stared at the steel bulkhead and\r\nwaited.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe ship\'s alarm clanged. Shano jerked from his bunk like a broken\r\nwatch spring. He crouched, trembling, on arthritic joints, as a\r\nloud-speaker blared throughout the ship.\r\n\r\n"_All hands! We now maintain dead silence. Close down and stop all\r\nmachinery. Power off and lights out. An enemy fleet is out there,\r\nlistening and watching for mechanical and electronic disturbance.\r\nAtmosphere will be maintained from emergency oxygen cylinders. Stop\r\npumps._"\r\n\r\nShano crouched and listened as the ship\'s steady drone ceased and the\r\nvibrations ceased. The pumps stopped, the lights went out.\r\n\r\nPressing the cold steel bulkhead, Shano heard oxygen hiss through the\r\npipes. Hiss and hiss and then flow soundlessly, filling the cabin and\r\nhis lungs. He choked.\r\n\r\nThe cabin was like a mine shaft, dark and cold. Feet pounded on the\r\ndeck outside.\r\n\r\nShano clawed open the door. He peered out anxiously.\r\n\r\nCold blobs of light, phosphorescent bulbs held in the fists of men,\r\nglimmered by. Phosphorescent bulbs, because the power was off. Shano\r\nblinked. He saw officers and men, their faces tight and pinched,\r\nhurrying in all directions. Hurrying to shut down the ship.\r\n\r\nHe acted impulsively. A young ensign strode by, drawn blaster in hand.\r\nShano followed him; followed the bluish glow of his bulb, through\r\nlabyrinthine passages and down a companionway, coughing and leering\r\nagainst the pain in his joints. The blue light winked out in the\r\ndistance and Shano stopped.\r\n\r\nHe was suddenly alarmed. The captain had warned him to stay in his\r\ncabin. He looked back and forth, wondering how to return.\r\n\r\nA bell clanged.\r\n\r\nShano saw a cold bulb glowing down the passageway, and he shuffled\r\nhopefully toward it. The bulb moved away. He saw an indistinct figure\r\ndisappear through a door marked, ENGINE ROOM.\r\n\r\nShano paused uncertainly at the end of the passageway. A thick cluster\r\nof vertical pipes filled the corner. He peered at the pipes and saw a\r\ngray box snuggled behind them. It had two toggle switches and a radium\r\ndial that quivered delicately.\r\n\r\nShano scratched his scalp as boots pounded on the decks, above\r\nand below. He listened attentively to the ship\'s familiar noises\r\ndiminishing one by one. And finally even the pounding of feet died out;\r\neverything became still. The silence shrieked in his ears.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe ship coasted. Shano could sense it coasting. He couldn\'t feel it\r\nor hear it, but he knew it was sliding ghost-like through space like a\r\nsubmarine dead under water, slipping quietly past a listening enemy.\r\n\r\nThe ship\'s speaker rasped softly. "_Emergency. Battle posts._"\r\n\r\nThe captain\'s voice. Calm, brief. It sent a tremor through Shano\'s\r\nbody. He heard a quick scuffle of feet again, running feet, directly\r\noverhead, and the captain\'s voice, more urgently, "Power on. They\'ve\r\nheard us."\r\n\r\nThe words carried no accusation, but Shano realized what they meant.\r\nA slip-up. Something left running. Vibrations picked up quickly by\r\ndetectors of the Uranian space fleet.\r\n\r\nShano coughed and heard the ship come to life around him. He pulled\r\nhimself out of the spasm, cursing Pluto. Cursing his diseased,\r\ngum-clogged lungs. Cursing the Uranian fleet that was trying to prevent\r\nhis going home--even to die.\r\n\r\nThis was a strange battle. Strange indeed. It was mostly silence.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, as though from another world, came a brief, curt order.\r\n"Port guns alert." Then hush and tension.\r\n\r\nThe deck lurched and the ship swung this way and that. Maybe dodging,\r\nmaybe maneuvering--Shano didn\'t know. He felt the deck lurch, that was\r\nall.\r\n\r\n"Fire number seven."\r\n\r\nHe heard the weird scream of a ray gun, and felt the constricting\r\nterror that seemed to belt the ship like an iron band.\r\n\r\nThis was a battle in space, and out there were Uranian cruisers trying\r\nto blast the _Stardust_ out of the sky. Trying and trying, while the\r\ncaptain dodged and fired back--pitted his skill and knowledge against\r\nan enemy Shano couldn\'t see.\r\n\r\nHe wanted desperately to help the captain break through, and get to\r\nEarth. But he could only cling to the plastic pipes and cough.\r\n\r\nThe ship jounced and slid beneath his feet, and was filled with sound.\r\nIt rocked and rolled. Shano caromed off the bulkhead.\r\n\r\n"Hold fire."\r\n\r\nHe crawled to his knees on the slippery deck, grabbed the pipes and\r\npulled himself erect, hand over hand. His eyes came level with the gray\r\nmetal box behind the pipes. He squinted, fascinated, at the quivering\r\ndial needle. "Hey!" he said.\r\n\r\n"Stand by."\r\n\r\nShano puzzled it out, his mind groping. He wasn\'t used to thinking.\r\nOnly working with his hands.\r\n\r\nThis box. This needle that had quivered when the ship was closed\r\ndown....\r\n\r\n"It\'s over. Chased them off. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
Ready guns before laying to. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
Third watch\r\non duty."\r\n\r\nShano sighed at the sudden release of tension throughout the space\r\nliner _Stardust_.\r\n\r\nSmoke spewed from his nostrils. His forehead wrinkled with\r\nconcentration. Those rumors: "Man sells out to Uranus, gets a nick cut\r\nin his jaw. Ever see a man with a nick in his jaw? Watch him, he\'s up\r\nto something." 

=== Chunk 10 ===
The talk of ignorant men. Shano remembered.\r\n\r\nHe poked behind the pipes and angrily slapped the toggle switches on\r\nthe box. The captain would only scoff. He\'d never believe there was a\r\ntraitor aboard who had planted an electronic signal box, giving away\r\nthe ship\'s position. He\'d never believe the babblings of an old man.\r\n\r\nHe straightened up, glaring angrily. He knew. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
And the knowledge made\r\nhim cold and furious. He watched the engine room emergency exit as it\r\nopened cautiously.\r\n\r\nA chunky man backed out, holstering a flat blaster. He turned and saw\r\nShano, standing smoking. He walked over and nudged Shano, his face\r\ndark. Shano blew smoke into the dark face.\r\n\r\n"Old man," said Rourke. "What\'re you doing down here?

=== Chunk 12 ===
"\r\n\r\nShano blinked.\r\n\r\nRourke fingered the nick in his jaw, eyes glinting. "You\'re supposed to\r\nbe in your cabin," he said. "Didn\'t I warn you we\'d run into trouble?"\r\n\r\nShano smoked and contemplated the chunky man. Estimated his strength\r\nand youth and felt the anger and frustration mount in him. "Devil," he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _"Devil," he said and dug his cigarette into the other\'s\r\nface._]\r\n\r\nHe lunged then, clawing. He dug the cigarette into Rourke\'s flushed\r\nface, and clung to his body. Rourke howled. He fell backward to the\r\ndeck, slapping at his blistered face. He thrashed around and Shano\r\nclung to him, battered, pressing the cigarette relentlessly, coughing,\r\ncursing the pain in his joints.\r\n\r\nShano grasped Rourke\'s neck with his hands. He twisted the neck with\r\nhis gnarled hands. Strong hands that had worked.\r\n\r\nHe got up when Rourke stopped thrashing. The face was purple and he\r\nwas dead. Shano shivered. He crouched in the passageway shivering and\r\ncoughing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA tremendous grinding sounded amid-ships. Loud rending noises of\r\nprotesting metal. The ship bucked like a hooked fish. Then it was\r\nstill. An empty clank echoed through the hull. The captain\'s voice\r\ncame, almost yelling. "Emergency! 

=== Chunk 13 ===
Emergency! Back to your posts. Engine\r\nroom--report! Engine room--"\r\n\r\nShano picked himself off the deck, his mind muddled. He coughed and\r\nput a cigarette to his lips, flicking a lighter disk jerkily from his\r\npocket. He blew smoke from his nostrils and heard the renewed pounding\r\nof feet. What was going on now?\r\n\r\n"Engine room! Your screen is dead! Switch onto loud-speaker system.\r\nEngine room!"\r\n\r\nGiddily, Shano heard clicks and rasps and then a thick voice, atom\r\nmotors whirring in the background.\r\n\r\n"Selector\'s gone, sir. Direct hit. Heat ray through the deck plates.\r\nWe\'ve sealed the tear. Might repair selector in five hours."\r\n\r\nShano coughed and sent a burst of smoke from his mouth.\r\n\r\n"Captain!" A rasping, grating sound ensued from a grill above Shano\'s\r\nhead, then a disconnected voice. "Get the men out of there. 

=== Chunk 14 ===
It\'s\r\nuseless. 

=== Chunk 15 ===
Hurry it up!" A series of clicks and the heavy voice of the\r\nchief engineer. "Captain! Somebody\'s smashed the selector chamber.\r\nEngine room\'s full of toxia gas!"\r\n\r\nShano jumped. He prodded the body on the deck with his toe.\r\n\r\nThe _Stardust\'s_ mechanical voice bellowed: "Engine room!" It\r\nreproduced the captain\'s heavy breathing and his tired voice. "We\'re\r\nabout midway to Venus," it said. "There were two ships and we drove\r\nthem off. But there may be others. They\'ll be coming back. They know\r\nwe\'ve been hit. We have to get away fast!"\r\n\r\nShano could see the captain in his mind, worried, squared face slick\r\nwith moisture. Shouting into a control room mike. Trying to find out\r\nwhat the matter was with his space ship.\r\n\r\nThe engineer\'s answer came from the grill. "Impossible, sir. Engine\r\nroom full of toxia gas. Not a suit aboard prepared to withstand it. And\r\nwe have to keep it in there. Selector filaments won\'t function without\r\nthe gas. Our only chance was to put a man in the engine room to repair\r\nthe broken selector valve rods or keep them running by hand."\r\n\r\n"Blast it!" roared the captain. "No way of getting in there? Can\'t you\r\nby-pass the selector?"\r\n\r\n"No. It\'s the heart of the new cosmic drive, sir. The fuels must pass\r\nthrough selector valves before entering the tube chambers. Filaments\r\nwill operate so long as toxia gas is there to burn, and will keep\r\ntrying to open the valves and compensate for fluctuating engine\r\ntemperature. But the rod pins have melted down, sir--they\'re common\r\ntungsten steel--and when the rods pull a valve open, they slip off and\r\ndrop down, useless. It\'s a mess. If we could only get a man in there\r\nhe might lift up the dropped end of a rod and slip it into place each\r\ntime it fell, and keep the valves working and feeding fuel."\r\n\r\nThe speaker spluttered and Shano smoked thoughtfully, listening to the\r\ntalk back and forth, between the captain and the engineer. He didn\'t\r\nunderstand it, but knew that everything was ended. They were broken\r\ndown in space and would never make Earth. Those Uranian devils would\r\ncome streaking back. Catch them floating, helpless, and blast them to\r\nbits. And he would never get home to die.\r\n\r\nShano coughed, and cursed his lungs. Time was when these gum-clogged\r\nlungs had saved his life. In the Plutonian mines. Gas explosions in the\r\ntunnels. Toxia gas, seeping in, burning the men\'s insides. But with\r\ngum-clogged lungs he\'d been able to work himself clear. Just getting\r\nsick where other men had died, their insides burned out.\r\n\r\nShano smoked and thought.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey wouldn\'t even know, he told himself, squirming through the\r\nemergency exit into the engine room, and sealing it after him. And they\r\nwouldn\'t understand if they did. Pink mist swirled about him. Toxia\r\ngas. Shano coughed.\r\n\r\nHe squinted around at the massive, incomprehensible machinery. The guts\r\nof the space ship.\r\n\r\nThen he saw the shattered, gold-gleaming cylinder, gas hissing from\r\na fine nozzle, and filaments glowing bluish inside it, still working\r\naway. He saw five heavy Carrsteel rods hanging useless, on melted-down\r\npins, and the slots their pronged ends hooked into. He looked at his\r\nhands, and shook his head.\r\n\r\n"One try," he said to himself. "One try, Shano. One important thing in\r\nyour life. 

=== Chunk 16 ===
Here\'s your opportunity. The toxia gas will get you. It\'ll\r\nkill you at this concentration. But you\'ll last for maybe twelve hours.\r\nAnother man wouldn\'t last a minute. Another man\'s lungs aren\'t clogged\r\nwith Juno gum."\r\n\r\nHe grasped a rod and lifted it, sweating under the weight, and slipped\r\nthe forked end into its slot. Going home to die, he thought. Well,\r\nmaybe not going home. 

=== Chunk 17 ===
Couldn\'t remember what Earth looked like anyway.\r\n\r\nWhat was that again? Oh yeah--just lift them up, and when they drop\r\noff, lift them up again.\r\n\r\nShano coughed, and lifted the heavy rods into position. One jerked back\r\nsuddenly and smoothly, and something went, "Pop, pop," behind him and\r\nmachinery whirred. He lifted the rod and slipped it back on. Another\r\njerked, pulled open a large valve, and dropped off. Shano bent, and\r\nlifted, coughing and coughing. He forgot what he was doing, mind blank\r\nthe way it went when he worked. Just rhythmically fell into the job,\r\nthe way a laborer does. He waited for a rod to slip and fall, then\r\nlifted it up and slipped it in place, skin sweating, joints shooting\r\npain along his limbs. He heard the machinery working. He heard the\r\nhigh, howling whine of cosmic jets. He, Shano, was making the machinery\r\ngo. He was running the cosmic drive.\r\n\r\nA bell clanged somewhere. "Engine room! Engine room! We\'re under way!\r\nWhat happened?"\r\n\r\nSilence, while Shano coughed and made the machinery go, thinking about\r\nthe Earth he hadn\'t seen for many years.\r\n\r\n"Captain!" the speaker bawled. "There\'s a man in there! Working the\r\nvalve rods! Somebody is in the engine room and the gas isn\'t...."\r\n\r\nShano grinned, feeling good. Feeling happy. Lifting the heavy steel\r\nrods, driving the ship. Keeping the jets screaming and hurtling the\r\nliner _Stardust_ toward Venus. He wondered if they\'d found Rourke yet.\r\nIf he could keep going for twelve hours they would get to Venus. After\r\nthat....\r\n\r\n"Home," he coughed. "Hell! Who wants to go home?"\r\n\r\nHe plucked at his agitated chest, thinking of a whole damn Uranian\r\nfleet swooping down on a spot in space, expecting to find a crippled\r\nship there with a spy inside it. And finding nothing. Because of Shano.\r\nA useless old man.\r\n\r\nCoughing came out all mixed up with laughing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
