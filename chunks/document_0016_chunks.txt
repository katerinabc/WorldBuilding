They\r\npicked their way slowly toward the shore together.\r\n\r\nOluf dropped gratefully to the warm sand. The sunset highlighted his\r\nreddish hair. "You\'re not far wrong--there was wolf spoor back on that\r\nnorth ridge. But what in the name of the Moon are you doing so far from\r\nNew York?"\r\n\r\n"Heading south, to stay," Bowron said. He scanned the brush and trees\r\nbehind them cautiously, then stretched out beside his companion,\r\nsighing. "I\'m getting too old for the winters, and the canned foods in\r\nthe ruins are getting scarcer every year."\r\n\r\nOluf looked at him in disbelief. "You\'re traveling alone?"\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t you?" The retort was sharp, with the keen edge of elderly pride.\r\n\r\nSomething like a weary chuckle sounded deep in Oluf\'s throat. He spoke\r\nwith easy candor. "Yes, but--look, Bowron, I\'m a hunter by choice. And\r\nI\'m big and in my prime. I can run half a day at top speed, and I\'m not\r\ntoo bad in a free-for-all. You\'re a teacher--wise, but not in the ways\r\nof the wilds; your senses are dull and your reactions slow, like all\r\ncity folk."\r\n\r\nBowron\'s eyes looked suddenly tired, older. He gazed out over the\r\nplacid water. "I could persuade no one to accompany me," he said\r\nsimply. "You made a good choice, Oluf, to terminate your education and\r\nseek the freedom of the wilds--the natural life that I think all must\r\nsomeday embrace." He sighed deeply.

"Of course, there is the dream of\r\nachievement that the city dwellers entertain. We\'ve grown soft in\r\nour dependence upon the buried food in the rubble--spending our time\r\nin study of the books and other god-things, always hoping that we can\r\nunderstand and duplicate the old civilization. But our best thinkers,\r\nsince they are the most eager searchers, stumble most often into the\r\nhidden pockets of radioactivity that endure even yet; and they die, and\r\ntheir knowledge dies with them, and our dreams and aspirations become\r\ndimmer with each generation."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOluf grunted, and Bowron went on as though to himself. "I\'ve come\r\nto believe that it\'s useless to follow in the footsteps of the\r\ngods--that we must wait, and think, and work, each in his own way,\r\nuntil we learn what is possible for us through our own trials and\r\nthe further development of our simple tools. We\'ve learned much from\r\nthe god-things, slowly, over the years. But we also know that we\'re\r\nmutants, changed by the radiation of the great war areas, breeding true\r\nat last, and that we are different from the Wild Ones. True, we\'re\r\nsuperior, but--we\'re not gods. Whether we can ever--"\r\n\r\nOluf had sprung to his feet and was gone with incredible speed. Bowron\r\nsat up tensely, listened to the crashing of brush, and, finally, to\r\na shrill squeal of departing life. He relaxed and waited until Oluf,\r\ngrinning, returned with a rabbit.\r\n\r\n"Our dinner, old-timer. Sorry I wasn\'t listening too closely to what\r\nyou were saying."\r\n\r\nLater, after they had eaten and were stretched comfortably on the\r\nmoon-drenched shore, Oluf grew reminiscent. "I remember your teachings,\r\nBowron. And I recall well our endless attempts to operate the\r\ngod-things--the machines and mechanisms. But all that always seemed\r\nstrange. Best of all I liked the tales of the old days--the stories of\r\nour ancestors."\r\n\r\nBowron nodded thoughtfully. "It was that way with most of my pupils. It\r\nwas more comfortable to dream of the past than to cope with the current\r\nhardships. It seemed to arouse some dormant instinct in all of us--" He\r\nbroke off and sighed. "Would you like to hear another of the stories?

"\r\n\r\n"Very much!"\r\n\r\nBowron studied the bright moon. "Well--once in the far and long ago,\r\nthere was a man named Smith, who lived in a big city...."\r\n\r\nWhen the tale was done, Oluf seemed deeply moved. "I believe," he said\r\nslowly, "that I\'ll go with you to the Southland. You might easily\r\nperish on the way, and such words as yours must live to give others\r\ncomfort and hope--for we may yet find living gods in some remote corner\r\nof the world. It must have been wonderful," he mused sleepily, "to\r\nhave lived in companionship with the gods--with men." He curled up\r\ncomfortably, paws tucked in, and laid his nose across his bushy tail.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
