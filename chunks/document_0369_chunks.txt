=== Chunk 2 ===
A whole year of\r\nfrolicking in store. Only one thing they\r\noverlooked--there was a curious convention going on._\r\n\r\n[Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\nPlanet Stories May 1953.\r\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe landing on the green planet, Koosh told himself in satisfaction,\r\nwas one of utmost perfection. Not that that made it unusual, since the\r\nMartian craft all but handled itself and invariably performed almost\r\none hundred per cent flawlessly. But Koosh did feel that this landing\r\nwas a little, just a little, better than average, and his ability as\r\npilot had made it so.\r\n\r\nThuko apparently thought the same, for he touched the other on the back\r\nof the neck in brief compliment.\r\n\r\nTwirling his eye-stalks in pleasure, Koosh pressed a button on the\r\ncontrol panel and arose to follow Thuko to the opening airlock, hopping\r\non one leg, which happened to be all that he or any Martian possessed.\r\n\r\nThey emerged into warm, late summer air. For a moment they stood,\r\nfilling their lungs, reveling in the rich, heady atmosphere that was so\r\nunlike their own.\r\n\r\n"Wonderful, Thuko!" Koosh enthused. "And to think we have a full year\r\nof it ahead of us!"\r\n\r\n"You are no less pleased than I," Thuko agreed. "But we must take care\r\nthat nothing happens to the ship in that time. Loss of it would mean\r\nthe end of all this."\r\n\r\nHe did not need to mention the reason. Koosh knew that it was because\r\nthe small craft was the only one in existence. At least, as far as Mars\r\nwas concerned. And of course that was because--well, actually it was\r\nnot a Martian ship.\r\n\r\nThousands of years ago a lone, exploring Jovian had landed on Mars.\r\nAfter brief inspection of the machine, the Martians had decided it was\r\na thing much worth having. They promptly murdered the Jovian, thereby\r\nneatly solving the problem of how to gain the gleaming silver sphere\r\nfor themselves.\r\n\r\nOperation of the ship had proved only a matter of learning the right\r\nbuttons to push. And the Martians were more than capable of making the\r\nfew simple repairs it required from time to time. But they were stumped\r\ncompletely by the anti-gravity plates that drove it. All attempts to\r\nduplicate them had ended fruitlessly. The original would have to serve\r\nthem until another Jovian came.\r\n\r\n"Where shall we put it for safekeeping?" Koosh asked. Then,\r\nanswering his own question, "I imagine a likely place would be on\r\nthe roof of an unoccupied building in whatever city we choose as our\r\ninitial--ah--host."\r\n\r\n"That is a good suggestion," said Thuko. "A rooftop would be ideal. Let\r\nus proceed to find one in a suitable metropolis."\r\n\r\nReentering the ship they took it aloft and skimmed over Earth\'s\r\nsurface, presently coming above a large city. A Terran would have\r\nrecognized it as Chicago. Eye-stalks pressed to the quartz window, the\r\nalien pair scrutinized closely each building they passed over.\r\n\r\n"There\'s one!" exclaimed Koosh. He pointed with the longest three of\r\nhis nine tendril-like appendages. "See it, Thuko?

=== Chunk 3 ===
"\r\n\r\n"I see it. Yes, it is obviously empty of life and has been for some\r\ntime. Set down the sphere, Koosh."\r\n\r\nTen minutes later they were standing on a gravelled rooftop, sucking in\r\nmore of the wonderful air of this hospitable world.\r\n\r\n"And so we begin our vacation on Earth," Koosh murmured softly,\r\nreverently. "A year, Thuko! a year of breathing this nectar ... of\r\nstuffing our poor starved bodies with fine foods unknown to Mars\'\r\nbarren soil. A year of abundance!"\r\n\r\nVacation. The Martians had acquired, however dishonestly, the means\r\nof travel through interplanetary space, and could think of no better\r\npurpose for it than hauling them to vacations on Earth, a world they\r\nhad long known to be rich in those things vital to life.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for the masses of Mars, the sphere could only carry two\r\npassengers a trip, with one acting as pilot. Therefore its use had been\r\nstrictly limited to high officials. Too bad for the masses; but lucky\r\nfor Koosh and Thuko, since they both held important offices. They were\r\nmerely the Shisti and Assistant Shisti, respectively.\r\n\r\nThe Assistant Shisti spoke now, the round orifice in the center of his\r\nface rapidly dilating and contracting. Ignoring the other\'s ecstatic\r\nbubblings, he said, "This will be fine, Koosh. Little could happen to\r\nthe ship here, unless the building collapsed. And of course we need not\r\nworry too much about the place remaining untenanted. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
That really makes\r\nsmall difference."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKoosh drooped his eye-stalks in agreement. "Except that the chances of\r\naccident would be increased somewhat. But now, let us leave here. This\r\ngravel punches through my sandal and hurts my foot."\r\n\r\nOn the street, they paused to consider their next move. While they\r\nstood there debating, a seedy, stoop-shouldered human came shuffling\r\nalong the walk and passed between them unheedingly, mumbling something\r\nabout, "Need dough. Gotta get wine money...."\r\n\r\nThe Shisti casually watched him out of sight around the corner, then\r\nsaid, "Astounding, Thuko, astounding. He gave no indication of having\r\nseen us. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
I must admit I don\'t completely understand it."\r\n\r\n"Who does?" countered Thuko. "It is something that science cannot\r\nsatisfactorily explain. All the savants know is that most of these\r\nEarthlings do not believe in our existence, and somehow that nonbelief\r\nacts to prevent them from acknowledging the evidence of their senses\r\nthat we are among them. Furthermore, wherever we go, if even one human\r\nin the immediate vicinity refuses to accept our reality, then we are\r\napparent to none, though we stand before a thousand.\r\n\r\n"The same thing applies to the ship. Not only that, but suppose I steal\r\nan object right out of the hands of a human and place it elsewhere. To\r\nhis mind it ceases to exist--never did exist. There was nothing to move\r\nit; it could not move itself; so his weak intellect takes the easiest\r\nway out by rejecting the whole affair.\r\n\r\n"All in all, we are about as safe as we could be. As long as there is\r\none non-believer somewhere near us."\r\n\r\n"It is a good thing," remarked Koosh. "The Earthmen might resent us if\r\nthey knew of our presence."\r\n\r\n"Yes." Thuko abruptly dismissed the subject and said, "I am\r\nincreasingly aware of the pangs of hunger. Perhaps we could best launch\r\nour sojourn on Earth with a festive orgy at some food emporium."\r\n\r\nKoosh liked the idea and forthwith they hopped off in search of a\r\nsupermarket, of which they had heard much from returning vacationers.\r\nEnough to start them drooling in anticipation.\r\n\r\nIn the first two blocks they bounded past a dozen or more pedestrians,\r\neach of whom paid them no attention.\r\n\r\nFive blocks more and they found what they were looking for. It bore the\r\nname of a well-known chain, though the colorful sign was meaningless to\r\nthe Shisti and his assistant, since the Martians had never taken the\r\ntrouble to learn any of Earth\'s multifarious languages, either written\r\nor spoken.\r\n\r\nThey entered, and at once their organs of scent were assailed by such a\r\nprofusion of saliva inspiring odors that Koosh all but collapsed in an\r\nague of rapture. He grasped a wheeled contrivance for support.\r\n\r\nThuko wasted no time in such preliminaries, but hopped frantically down\r\nthe aisle into the produce department, grabbed a huge cabbage and began\r\neating with all the gusto of a circus fat lady down to her last three\r\nhundred pounds.\r\n\r\nNearby the produce clerk leaned drowsily against the sacked potato\r\ndisplay, enjoying the respite offered by a mid-morning slack period.\r\nOblivious to the theft of the cabbage and the crunching sounds\r\nresultant therefrom, he speculatively eyed an under-dressed blonde\r\ntripping by the window.\r\n\r\nThuko finished the vegetable and without pause started on a stalk of\r\nbananas. Meanwhile, in another aisle, Koosh had discovered the delights\r\nof Gro-Pup and was well into his second box. There was a lifetime of\r\nnear-starvation to counterbalance, and if that could be done in one\r\nshort year this voracious team would obviously accomplish it.\r\n\r\nThey moved slowly along the shelves, stowing away incredible amounts\r\nof food and drink. When at last their paths met in the canned goods\r\nsection, Thuko picked up one of the cylindrical objects and stared at\r\nit, thinking. Koosh waited patiently. A minute passed and it seemed the\r\nproblem would defeat the Assistant Shisti. But then his eye was caught\r\nby the butcher wielding a cleaver on a side of beef.\r\n\r\nBells rang in Thuko\'s head. He hopped behind the meat counter, obtained\r\na second cleaver from its hanging place and returned. Great was his\r\ntriumph as he lopped off the tops of two of the containers, spattering\r\nKoosh with stewed tomatoes. With hunger redoubled by the delay, the\r\nMartians emptied can after can of fruits, vegetables, juices and meats,\r\ntossing the decapitated tins behind them in the aisle.\r\n\r\nA plumpish woman shopper approached, waddling along unhurriedly,\r\npausing occasionally to squint at a grocery list and take an item from\r\nthe shelves. As she neared Koosh and Thuko, she reached out for a can\r\nof peas and in so doing brought her hand against the back of Koosh\'s\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nKoosh grunted in annoyance and moved his head out of the way. The woman\r\nmade another try and this time secured the can of peas. She placed it\r\nin her cart and moved on, apparently unaware that anything out of the\r\nordinary had happened.\r\n\r\nNot much later she would develop leprosy. For that, incredible as it\r\nseems, was just how every leper throughout time had contracted the\r\ndisease. By coming in accidental contact with a vacationing Martian.\r\n\r\nThe Martians did not know of it, of course. But even if they had, it\r\nwould have made no difference to them. Should it be their worry if a\r\nblundering Earthian caught from them an incurable ailment? One which to\r\nthem was not even a disease? Obviously not.\r\n\r\nThe Shisti and his assistant went on eating, squealing in delight with\r\nthe first delicious taste of each new food.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe beginning of their second day on Earth found Koosh and Thuko\r\nhopping along the street in quest of new pleasures. The air was damp\r\nand raw. Overhead a leaden sky threatened the world below, hinting at\r\nthe unpleasant equinoctial weather soon to come. But the two Martians\r\ntook no notice, accustomed as they were to the awful winds and cold of\r\ntheir home planet. This was paradise in comparison.\r\n\r\nKoosh reddled a little song with his eye-stalks as they bounded through\r\ndowntown traffic, but took care not to lose himself in it to the point\r\nof coming down in the path of one of the whizzing cars. The terrifying\r\nmachines did not need to believe in their existence to smash them to\r\nbloody pulp.\r\n\r\nIn front of a swank hotel, Thuko called a halt and motioned with a\r\ntendril. "This would be a likely place to find thrilling luxuries.\r\nMy friend Yemma told me that on his vacation he lived a month in the\r\nkitchen of one of these structures and when he came out was so fat he\r\ncould scarcely hop."\r\n\r\nKoosh dribbled spittle. "Wonderful, wonderful. We shall outdo Yemma. We\r\nshall spend three months and come out fat even in our tendrils!"\r\n\r\nThuko opened the door and they entered. The lobby was empty except\r\nfor a clerk behind the desk, who was at the moment engrossed in a\r\nnewspaper. Ignoring him, they crossed the room in panic haste as a\r\nfaint but delectable fragrance floated into their scent organs.\r\n\r\nThe spacious dining hall was crowded with humanity. At one table a\r\ntall, thin man was speaking into a microphone, while all eyes turned\r\nin his direction. Most raptly attentive of all were the great number\r\nof youthful diners, who seemed to regard the speaker with an awe that\r\nbordered on worship.\r\n\r\nOnto this scene came Koosh and Thuko, hot on the trail of eatables and\r\ndrinkables. Spying the door to the kitchen, they hurried toward it\r\nbetween the tables, gabbling at each other in passionate conjecture at\r\nthe delicacies awaiting them.\r\n\r\nThey were little prepared for the furor that followed.\r\n\r\nIt began at the first table they passed. A woman sitting there glanced\r\ntheir way, pointed at them, opened her mouth in a piercing scream and\r\nfainted dead away on the floor.\r\n\r\nThe man with her jumped to his feet, shouting something in a hoarse\r\nvoice. It sounded like: "They\'re here! It\'s finally happened! Now let\'s\r\nsee them call us crazy!"\r\n\r\nOthers stood up, attracted by the hubbub. They craned to see; and when\r\nthey did, they too began yelling and gesticulating, until the dining\r\nhall was one vast sea of sound and motion.\r\n\r\nThe Shisti and his assistant hesitated, hopped forward again, stopped\r\nfinally in utter confusion. For the first time on this planet, fear\r\ncaught at them. Could this truly be? Was it really possible that they\r\nhad been detected? Did all of these humans believe in the Martians\'\r\nexistence?\r\n\r\nPlainly, they did.\r\n\r\n"We must flee, Koosh!" Thuko bawled in terror. "Return to the ship!"\r\nAnd suiting action to words, he turned and went leaping back the way\r\nthey had come. Koosh followed close on his heel, with an alacrity\r\nunusual for that individual.\r\n\r\n"Wait! Wait, please!" 

=== Chunk 6 ===
someone called. "We won\'t harm you!"\r\n\r\nOthers took it up. But of course Koosh and Thuko did not understand.\r\nThey rushed on. And the crowd poured after them like a tidal wave,\r\npleading with them to stop.\r\n\r\nThrough the lobby, out the front entrance, down the steps, the Martians\r\nhopped with speed born of desperation. They started across the street,\r\nunheeding of the traffic, intent only on escape from their howling\r\npursuers. Consequently they did not see the huge truck bearing down on\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nNor did the driver of the truck see them. Not that he was unalert. No,\r\nit was merely that he did not believe in Martians. Just as dozens of\r\nother motorists and pedestrians close around did not believe in them.\r\n\r\nThe truck rolled forward. There was a crunching, squishing sound. A\r\nblue fluid spattered over the hood and chunks of spongy flesh rained\r\ndown under the wheels as the delicately built aliens came apart in a\r\nthousand pieces. An eye-stalk, twitching violently, bounced off the cab\r\nroof.\r\n\r\nThe truck rumbled on, the driver whistling a cheery tune. Bits of Koosh\r\nand Thuko rode with him, caught in the grill. So ended the Shisti and\r\nAssistant Shisti\'s vacation on Earth....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMost of the diners had gone back into the hotel. They had stood for\r\nan indecisive moment, looking this way and that. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Baffled by the\r\ndisappearance of the alien beings, they had straggled inside one by\r\none. Few words were spoken among them, since each was mentally busy\r\nforming a theory to explain the occurrence.\r\n\r\nTwo of those who dallied behind, both youths, had already come up\r\nwith explanations, and were telling them to each other with great\r\nzealousness and many a gesture.\r\n\r\n"Listen," said Bicks. "I tell you they used invisibility belts.\r\nSomething got out of whack with them just when those beings entered\r\nthe dining hall and we saw them. They high-tailed it, working on the\r\nbelts as they ran. By the time they reached the street, they had them\r\nrepaired. Zap!--just like that, they were invisible again and we lost\r\nthem. It\'s simple.

=== Chunk 8 ===
"\r\n\r\n"It\'s too simple," said Paul scornfully. "Why would both belts conk out\r\nat once? My idea is that they came out of another dimension. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
Looking\r\nEarth over for conquest, maybe. But when they found themselves in\r\nthe hotel surrounded by a lot of people--we\'d be monsters to them,\r\nyou know--they got panicky and ran. Then they recovered, switched on\r\nwhatever gadget they use, and returned to their own dimension. I\'d bet\r\nmy life that\'s the real answer."\r\n\r\nBicks didn\'t agree. He ridiculed the theory, improvised a joke about\r\nit. His companion answered hotly. Immersed in argument they walked\r\nslowly up the hotel steps.\r\n\r\nBoth glanced briefly at the large banner stretched above the door. The\r\nbanner which read:\r\n\r\n                       WELCOME TO THE CHICON II!\r\n                      10th WORLD SCIENCE-FICTION\r\n                              CONVENTION\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
