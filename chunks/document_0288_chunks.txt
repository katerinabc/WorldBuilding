So I left the needles in my wrists--the\r\ntubes let me reach Brain One--and started punching data from the\r\ninstruments while my fingers were still half stiff. Finally, stiff\r\nfingers or not, I had all the data racked into the primary feed and\r\ndecided to check on the passengers. It amused me somewhat to note that\r\neven Brain One was strictly stalling for time when it came to figuring\r\nout where we were, and why. There was much buzzing and clicking but no\r\ntape feeding out, yet. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Well, let the Brain figure it out. I had other\r\nthings to do.\r\n\r\nI strolled back to secondary freeze unit and checked Combatman. He\r\nwas on top of the heap, of course--as stiff as a fresh steak, so I\r\nstuck the needles in his wrists and switched to defrost. Automatic\r\nlift pulled him out and beneath him was the male Homonorm and the two\r\nfemale Homonorms. They came out, too, as the lifts worked, and pretty\r\nsoon the cabin looked like a morgue--or a cannibal\'s shop, if you\r\nprefer. Anyway, they were defrosting, so I left \'em to make a check\r\non Brain One and see what brilliant, if mechanical conclusion it had\r\nreached. Should be at least an hour before Combatman thawed--even with\r\nthe needles pumping.\r\n\r\nBrain One was feeding out tape now, slow as a snail considering its\r\ncycling rate, so I figured we were a long way from home. Okay with\r\nme--I\'d been around and knew that if we could get somewhere we could\r\nget back. But I wanted, and wanted bad, the data from Time-Warp gauges.\r\nSo I watched the tape, decoding mentally as it fed out and feeling, for\r\na Computerman, an emotion similar to impatience.\r\n\r\nWe were approaching--the Brain told me--a type three planet,\r\nradiations okay, atmosphere higher in oxygen than home, gravity\r\nslightly lighter in pull than normal--the same junk I\'d been picking\r\nup since we started colonizing. Land masses stable, water in the air,\r\nsemi-condensed. Good place for colonizing, and this pleased me. We were\r\nout to establish and leave the Homonorms for a generation, and Brain\r\nOne had figured all the details out while I was sitting in freeze like\r\na hamburger. So far, so good.\r\n\r\nOne thing annoyed, or puzzled me. I kept throwing data from TV and\r\nRadar into Feed-back and asking about population, life forms, land\r\ndenizens. All Brain One came up with was Insufficient Data. All right.\r\nIt would be just another routine landing on another distant planet.\r\nThen I heard the noise behind me and turned. Combatman stood in the\r\ndoorway, his skin still bluish from the freeze, his eyes just clearing\r\nand working into focus.\r\n\r\nI looked him over while he stood there, somewhat surprised--if one can\r\never be surprised at what his race did. He was hung with enough weapons\r\nto stop a division of Homonorms and I wondered, as I always did, at the\r\norigin of his race. His type always came drifting down from somewhere\r\nnorth, back home, and all our radar and planes had never found their\r\nhomeland. None of them ever talked with humans except to nose in on our\r\nexpeditions or break up our wars. This one was quite a specimen, maybe\r\nsix feet, about 180 pounds, with the quiet and arrogant strength of his\r\nrace. He took a deep breath, still leaning on the door frame.\r\n\r\n"Get me some whiskey," his voice was hoarse from disuse and the\r\nTime-Warp, "and get it now."\r\n\r\n"Now, see here," I began, "I\'m Computerman and in charge of this ship\r\nand...."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI didn\'t finish. With the quiet sureness of a jungle cat he had crossed\r\nthe room, taken a handful of my tunic and lifted me from the chair--in\r\nspite of the fact that gravity was nearly normal now because of the\r\nlanding jets. His voice was almost velvety.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you didn\'t hear me. I will repeat once more." He paused while\r\nI considered striking him and then, sensibly, changed my mind. "Get me\r\nsome whiskey." Then he dropped me back into the chair.\r\n\r\nI\'m not Computerman for nothing, so I computed the situation in maybe\r\na thousandth of a second. No one could push me around, so to prevent\r\nbeing pushed around I got him his whiskey. He knocked off about a half\r\npint at a swallow and in a few minutes his skin lost its bluish tinge.\r\nHe was awake, and his quick eyes swept the gauges and the TV-Radar\r\nimage.\r\n\r\n"When do we land?" He made no attempt to be courteous.\r\n\r\nI checked Brain One\'s tape, somewhat rattled. "Twenty-one minutes, four\r\nseconds," I started, resisting a strange impulse to say \'sir\', "Near\r\nwater, fresh, altitude under one mile from...."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all," he said. "Thanks." He left the room like a cat, crouching\r\nslightly as he went through the door, leaping through and backing\r\nagainst the wall, but fast, once he cleared. His weapons, all of them,\r\nwere so skillfully hung that he didn\'t make a sound. Somehow, I enjoyed\r\nwatching the play of those muscles and felt rather glad to have him\r\nalong, rough as he was. Outlying planets often have warlike combat\r\norganizations of their own, and Combatmen have saved many expeditions\r\nlike this. Something in their nature, or training--or both--seems to\r\nmake them invincible.\r\n\r\nI turned back to Brain One, checked the wiring on the denizen circuit\r\nand tried to get more information about possible inhabitants. No luck.\r\nEither there were none or they were so highly civilized they could\r\nblock off our probing rays. That had happened before, and it usually\r\nmeant a minor war. We always won, though we sometimes had to dig in and\r\nsend for the Control Fleet from home. The Fleet was run by Combatmen,\r\nthough no Homonorm had ever figured out how they eased into all the key\r\npositions. They were quite a race, all right.\r\n\r\nSo I sat watching the Radarscreen and the planet, enlarging rapidly.\r\nIt looked pretty good--about a quarter to a third land mass, I\r\nguessed--just like home. Combatman came back in the room, quietly.\r\n\r\n"Your pap-fed colonists are waking," he grunted. "Better go and\r\nwet-nurse them. They might catch cold." He sat down in the pilot\'s\r\nchair, much to my annoyance, and swilled away at his bottle. I noticed\r\nhe\'d replaced the original crock, and felt a moment\'s concern. After\r\nall, we depended for basic safety on his training, in the event of\r\nencountering hostility. He seemed utterly unconcerned as he lazily\r\nwatched the screen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Homonorms were doing all right, complaining as usual about the cold\r\nand asking silly questions about where we were and what year it was--or\r\nwould be at home. I ducked the questions, gave them their hypos and\r\nwent back to Brain One and the control panel. One look at controls and\r\nI started boiling; this was the last straw.\r\n\r\n"Now, goddamit," I started, "you can boss me around, but when it comes\r\nto...."\r\n\r\n"Shut up!"\r\n\r\n"I will not shut up...."\r\n\r\n"Okay." He was calm, leisurely, even--but before I realized it he was\r\nrising, crossed the room and I had an arm behind me. It didn\'t hurt but\r\nI felt pretty helpless. Completely helpless, to be truthful.\r\n\r\n"Could it be," he appeared to be bored, "that you are tired of having\r\ntwo arms?" He twisted slightly and I got the idea so I shut up, for\r\nthe second time. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
After a few seconds he sat down in my chair and had\r\nanother drink. When I could talk without sputtering I worked up my\r\nmildest voice.\r\n\r\n"Would you tell me," I almost choked on the next word, "_Please_, what\r\nin hell is the idea of circling at twenty miles, then dropping to ten\r\nand circling some more? We\'re wasting tons of fuel which we may need\r\nfor--"\r\n\r\n"Sure, brainy one, I\'ll tell you. I want to see what this place looks\r\nlike and _I\'m_ picking the landing site. Not you or that pile of\r\nrattling tin there." He gestured contemptuously at Brain One.\r\n\r\n"Pile of tin!" I couldn\'t say more so I went back to the rear and\r\nhelped the Homonorms find food and the simple plasticlothes they\'d be\r\nwearing. The ship lurched suddenly as it changed course at twenty miles\r\nand started circling. Even back here I could hear Brain One clacking in\r\nprotest over the conflicting instructions. That big lunk of a fighting\r\nman, of course, hadn\'t had sense enough to punch Clear and Recompute\r\nwhen he changed course and I could see the tape in my mind\'s eye\r\npouring frantically out with Data Please, Data Please....\r\n\r\nOh, well.\r\n\r\nHomonorms were thawing okay but crying like babies from Time-Warp\r\nsickness and space fright. I expected this and let them cry it out.\r\nMeanwhile I got busy with Sensory Receptors to see if anything we knew\r\nof could be blocking Brain One\'s circuits. This lack of info about\r\nthe denizens had me a little worried: it wasn\'t often Brain One came\r\nup with a blank, on any subject. It made me furious to be working\r\nlike mad here while that big oaf lounged in _my_ chair slopping up a\r\nyear\'s supply of stimulant. Defending the ship was his job; he should\r\nbe trying to find out what was doing below us. Instead, he sat around\r\nwatching Radarscreen just like he was watching the fights his race\r\nstaged back home for amusement.\r\n\r\nThe ship lurched violently. Then it lurched again. I started forward,\r\nworried, but the tailjets blasted and I slammed against a wall, pinned\r\ntight. The pressure cut my wind and I fainted. My last recollection was\r\nthe smell of scorching duralumin. We\'d been hit, by something.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen I revived, we were back at Gravnorm and I staggered, literally,\r\nback to control. My nose was still bleeding, and the Homonorms, of\r\ncourse, were still unconscious. Combatman sat comfortably in my padded\r\nchair, almost dreamily watching the screen. I felt a surge of anger,\r\nthen realized I was too feeble to support such an emotion. Remembering\r\nmy Psycho training I redirected to curiosity.\r\n\r\n"What...." my voice sounded pretty shaky and Combatman handed me the\r\nbottle, grinning.\r\n\r\n"Quite a race down there," he seemed pleased. Then he spat, expertly,\r\nthe result landing on the Radarscreen. "Can you work that thing?"\r\n\r\n"Of course," I muttered, half-insulted.\r\n\r\n"Okay. We\'re at a hundred miles. Get that in focus as of two miles,\r\nslow the ship and prepare to hold stationary when I see what I want to\r\nknow."\r\n\r\nWeakly I fumbled with the controls, sniffling back the blood from my\r\nnose.\r\n\r\n"And turn off this tin god of yours," he continued. "That clacking\r\nracket annoys me." Casually, he kicked the part of Brain One nearest\r\nhim, which was the back of Wiring Panel Six.\r\n\r\n"Oh, _no_...." I began. But I did as I was told and ran Brain One\r\nthrough three clearing cycles, just to make sure. There was no telling\r\nwhat this lummox may have done in my absence. Now I\'d have to check\r\neverything and feed in the information all over again.\r\n\r\nCombatman leaned back in the chair like he expected dental work, and\r\nyawned luxuriously. He watched as the screen blurred and focused,\r\nblurred and focused. It was sweeping at two miles and the ship was\r\nslowing. We dropped tail down and Grav changed faster than the interior\r\nhull moved. Finally we settled, and coasted above this planet.\r\n\r\nThe ship lurched, twice this time almost simultaneously. Then it\r\nlurched steadily. Combatman threw the All Screens switch and watched\r\nthe Radar. By now, he was tense.\r\n\r\n"At a hundred miles...." he muttered. "What a race this is!"\r\n\r\nHe watched the screen with eyes that reminded me more of a cat\'s than a\r\nhuman\'s.\r\n\r\n"Stop!"\r\n\r\nFrom habit I threw the master Out Switch and everything stopped--our\r\nmotion coordinated precisely with the planet\'s, the Radar focused where\r\nit had been--and I got slammed against a wall again, of course. Well--I\r\nmight as well get used to it. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
When my eyes cleared I studied the\r\nimage. It was a rather crude city of considerable size, though poorly,\r\ndesigned from the light, ventilation and transport angle. There was\r\nconsiderable movement, apparently ground vehicles of some sort. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Then I\r\nlooked at Combatman. His face was registering disbelief and something\r\nresembling alarm--though I\'d never heard of any of his race being\r\nreally frightened.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe missile warning light blinked frantically and the ship started\r\nlurching and pitching again. Combatman turned toward me and his face\r\nwas taut and urgent.\r\n\r\n"How soon can you get into Time-Warp?"\r\n\r\n"And--and _leave_?

=== Chunk 7 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Right, and the sooner the better." He flipped the height control\r\nand we moved, smoothly this time, up away from the missiles blasting\r\noutside our protective screen. "There\'ll be no colonizing done here."\r\n\r\n"But--but our orders were to...."\r\n\r\n"No colonizing here. Put your Homonorms back in the freezer and set up\r\nfor return. Do it now.

=== Chunk 8 ===
"\r\n\r\nStunned, I went rearward and told the people. They didn\'t like the\r\nidea very much, but regulations said that when the ship was attacked,\r\nCombatman was absolute boss. Then I returned. Combatman shot a glance\r\nat me and I nodded, then went to work on the Control panel, reversing\r\nthe whole set up.\r\n\r\n"When you finish I\'ll get in your ice box," Combatman said. "And when\r\nyou get out of Time-Warp destroy that wiring. None of your ships is to\r\ncome back here."\r\n\r\nI digested this slowly, wondering how to report to the council. "Why\r\nnot?" 

=== Chunk 9 ===
I ventured. "Perhaps with part of the Control Fleet...."\r\n\r\n"The whole Control Fleet wouldn\'t last two days on a desert of that\r\nworld, Brainboy," he said. His eyes misted faintly for a fraction of a\r\nsecond. "Those denizens, as you call them, are all members of my race,\r\nand this planet was my home--we called it Earth."\r\n\r\nHe yawned and strode to the rear and the freezer. At the portal he\r\nturned and grinned. "And don\'t ask me how we get back and forth. I\r\nmight get mad and have my whole family drop over--in-laws and all."\r\n\r\nI didn\'t really understand him, so went on with my wiring.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
