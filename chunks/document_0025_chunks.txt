C. L. MOORE_\r\n\r\n\r\n He had been promising himself this moment for how\r\n many lonely months and years on alien worlds?\r\n\r\n\r\nBeneath him the clovered hill-slope was warm in the sun. Northwest Smith\r\nmoved his shoulders against the earth and closed his eyes, breathing so\r\ndeeply that the gun holstered upon his chest drew tight against its\r\nstrap as he drank the fragrance of Earth and clover warm in the sun.\r\nHere in the hollow of the hills, willow-shaded, pillowed upon clover and\r\nthe lap of Earth, he let his breath run out in a long sigh and drew one\r\npalm across the grass in a caress like a lover's.\r\n\r\nHe had been promising himself this moment for how long--how many months\r\nand years on alien worlds? He would not think of it now. He would not\r\nremember the dark spaceways or the red slag of Martian drylands or the\r\npearl-gray days on Venus when he had dreamed of the Earth that had\r\noutlawed him. So he lay, with his eyes closed and the sunlight drenching\r\nhim through, no sound in his ears but the passage of a breeze through\r\nthe grass and a creaking of some insect nearby--the violent,\r\nblood-smelling years behind him might never have been. Except for the\r\ngun pressed into his ribs between his chest and the clovered earth, he\r\nmight be a boy again, years upon years ago, long before he had broken\r\nhis first law or killed his first man.\r\n\r\nNo one else alive now knew who that boy had been. Not even the all\r\nknowing Patrol. Not even Venusian Yarol, who had been his closest friend\r\nfor so many riotous years. No one would ever know--now. Not his name\r\n(which had not always been Smith) or his native land or the home that\r\nhad bred him, or the first violent deed that had sent him down the\r\ndevious paths which led here--here to the clover hollow in the hills of\r\nan Earth that had forbidden him ever to set foot again upon her soil.\r\n\r\nHe unclasped the hands behind his head and rolled over to lay a scarred\r\ncheek on his arm, smiling to himself. Well, here was Earth beneath him.\r\nNo longer a green star high in alien skies, but warm soil, new clover so\r\nnear his face he could see all the little stems and trefoil leaves,\r\nmoist earth granular at their roots. An ant ran by with waving antennae\r\nclose beside his cheek. He closed his eyes and drew another deep breath.\r\nBetter not even look; better to lie here like an animal, absorbing the\r\nsun and the feel of Earth blindly, wordlessly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow he was not Northwest Smith, scarred outlaw of the spaceways. Now he\r\nwas a boy again with all his life before him. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
There would be a\r\nwhite-columned house just over the hill, with shaded porches and white\r\ncurtains blowing in the breeze and the sound of sweet, familiar voices\r\nindoors. There would be a girl with hair like poured honey hesitating\r\njust inside the door, lifting her eyes to him. Tears in the eyes. He lay\r\nvery still, remembering.\r\n\r\nCurious how vividly it all came back, though the house had been ashes\r\nfor nearly twenty years, and the girl--the girl ...\r\n\r\nHe rolled over violently, opening his eyes. No use remembering her.\r\nThere had been that fatal flaw in him from the very first, he knew now.\r\nIf he were the boy again knowing all he knew today, still the flaw would\r\nbe there and sooner or later the same thing must have happened that had\r\nhappened twenty years ago. He had been born for a wilder age, when men\r\ntook what they wanted and held what they could without respect for law.\r\nObedience was not in him, and so--\r\n\r\nAs vividly as on that day it happened he felt the same old surge of\r\nanger and despair twenty years old now, felt the ray-gun bucking hard\r\nagainst his unaccustomed fist, heard the hiss of its deadly charge\r\nravening into a face he hated. He could not be sorry, even now, for that\r\nfirst man he had killed. But in the smoke of that killing had gone up\r\nthe columned house and the future he might have had, the boy\r\nhimself--lost as Atlantis now--and the girl with the honey-colored hair\r\nand much, much else besides. It had to happen, he knew. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
He being the boy\r\nhe was, it had to happen. Even if he could go back and start all over,\r\nthe tale would be the same.\r\n\r\nAnd it was all long past now, anyhow; and nobody remembered any more at\r\nall, except himself. A man would be a fool to lie here thinking about it\r\nany longer.\r\n\r\nSmith grunted and sat up, shrugging the gun into place against his ribs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ January 1957.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.
