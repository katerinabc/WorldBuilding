He dropped the big wooden latch behind him, and climbed up\r\nthe ladder to the loft, depending on the slight strength of his young\r\narms more than on his legs, which had to be lifted to straining heights\r\nbefore they could negotiate the man-sized rungs.\r\n\r\nHe reached the loft and stood panting, looking out over the farm through\r\nthe loft door, at the light wooden fences around it, and the circling\r\nantenna of the radar tower.\r\n\r\nUsually, he spent at least a little time each day crouched behind the\r\ngrainsacks and being bigger and older, firing cooly and accurately into\r\ncharging companies of burly, thick-lipped UES soldiers, or going over on\r\none wing and whistling down on a flight of TT-34\'s that scattered like\r\nfrightened ducks before the fiery sleet of his wing rockets.\r\n\r\nBut today was different, today there was something he wanted to try.\r\n\r\nHe stood up on his toes and searched. He felt the touch of Miss Cowan\'s\r\nmind, no different from that of anyone else--flat, unsystematic.\r\n\r\nHe sighed. Perhaps, somewhere, there was someone else like himself. For\r\na moment, the fright of loneliness invaded him, but then faded. He took\r\na last look at the farm, then moved away from the open door, letting his\r\nmind slip into another way of thinking.\r\n\r\nHis chubby features twisted into a scowl of concentration as he\r\nvisualized reality. The scowl became a deeper grimace as he negated that\r\nreality, step by step, and substituted another.\r\n\r\n    _F is for Phildee._\r\n    _O is for Out._\r\n    _R is for Reimann._\r\n    _T is for Topology._\r\n    _H is for heartsick hunger._\r\n\r\nAbruptly, the Reimann fold became a concrete visualization. As though\r\nprinted clearly in and around the air, which was simultaneously both\r\naround him and not around him, which existed/not existed in spacetime,\r\nhe saw the sideslip diagram.\r\n\r\nHe twisted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSpring had come to Riya\'s world; spring and the thousand sounds of it.\r\nThe melted snow in the mountaintops ran down in traceries of leaping\r\nwater, and the spring-crests raced along the creeks into the rivers. The\r\nriverbank grasses sprang into life; the plains turned green again.\r\n\r\nRiya made her way up the path across the foothills, conscious of her\r\nshame. The green plain below her was dotted, two by two, with the\r\nfigures of her people. It was spring, and Time. Only she was alone.\r\n\r\nThere was a special significance in the fact that she was here on this\r\npath in this season. The plains on either side of the brown river were\r\nher people\'s territory. During the summer, the couples ranged over the\r\ngrass until the dams were ready to drop their calves. Then it became the\r\nbulls\' duty to forage for their entire families until the youngsters\r\nwere able to travel south to the winter range.\r\n\r\nThrough the space of years, the people had increased in numbers, the\r\npressure of this steady growth making itself felt as the yearlings\r\nfilled out on the winter range. It had become usual, as the slow drift\r\nnorthward was made toward the end of winter, for some of the people to\r\nsplit away from the main body and range beyond the gray mountains that\r\nmarked the western limits of the old territories. Since these wanderers\r\nwere usually the most willful and headstrong, they were regarded as\r\nquasi-outcasts by the more settled people of the old range.\r\n\r\nBut--and here Riya felt the shame pierce more strongly than ever--they\r\nhad their uses, occasionally. Preoccupied in her shame, she\r\ninvoluntarily turned her head downward, anxious that none of the people\r\nbe staring derisively upward at the shaggy brown hump of fur that was\r\nshe, toiling up the path.\r\n\r\nShe was not the first--but that was meaningless. That other female\r\npeople had been ugly or old, that the same unforgotten force that urged\r\nher up the mountain path had brought others here before her, meant only\r\nthat she was incapable of accepting the verdict of the years that had\r\nthinned her pelt, dimmed her eyes, and broken the smooth rhythm of her\r\ngait.\r\n\r\nIn short, it meant that Riya Sair, granddam times over, spurned by every\r\nmale on the old range, was willing to cross the gray mountains and risk\r\ndeath from the resentful wild dams for the thin hope that there was a\r\nmale among the wildlings who would sire her calf.\r\n\r\nShe turned her head back to the path and hurried on, cringing in inward\r\nself-reproach at her speed.\r\n\r\nExcept for her age, Riya presented a perfect average of her people. She\r\nstood two yards high and two wide at the shoulders, a yard at the\r\nhaunches, and measured three and a half yards from her muzzle to the\r\nrudimentary tail. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
Her legs were short and stumpy, cloven-hooved. Her\r\nmassive head hung slightly lower than her shoulders, and could be\r\nlowered to within an inch or two of the ground. She was herbivorous,\r\nruminant, and mammalian. Moreover, she had intelligence--not of a very\r\nhigh order, but adequate for her needs.\r\n\r\nFrom a Terrestrial point of view, none of this was remarkable. Many\r\nyears of evolution had gone into her fashioning--more years for her one\r\nspecies than for all the varieties of man that have ever been.\r\nNevertheless, she did have some remarkable attributes.\r\n\r\nIt was one of these attributes that now enabled her to sense what\r\nhappened on the path ahead of her. She stopped still, only her long fur\r\nmoving in the breeze.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPhildee--five, towheaded, round faced, chubby, dressed in a slightly\r\ngrubby corduroy oversuit, and precocious--had his attributes, too.\r\nGrubby and tousled; branded with a thread of licorice from one corner of\r\nhis mouth to his chin; involved in the loss of his first milk-tooth, as\r\nhe was--he nevertheless slipped onto the path on Riya\'s world, the\r\nhighest product of Terrestrial evolution. Alice followed a white rabbit\r\ndown a hole. Phildee followed Reimann down into a hole that, at the same\r\ntime, followed him, and emerged--where?\r\n\r\nPhildee didn\'t know. He could have performed the calculation necessary\r\nto the task almost instantly, but he was five. It was too much trouble.\r\n\r\nHe looked up, and saw a gray slope of rock vaulting above him. He looked\r\ndown, and saw it fall away toward a plain on which were scattered pairs\r\nof foraging animals. He felt a warm breeze, smelled it, saw it blow dust\r\nalong the path, and saw Riya:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n    _B is for big brown beast._\r\n    _L is for looming large, looking lonely._\r\n    _B? L? 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Bull? No--bison._\r\n    _Bison:_\r\n\r\n           bison (bi\'sn) _n._ The buffalo of the N. Amer. plains.\r\n\r\nPhildee shook his head and scowled. No--not bison, either. What, then?\r\nHe probed.\r\n\r\nRiya took a step forward. The sight of a living organism other than a\r\nperson was completely unfamiliar to her. Nevertheless, anything that\r\nsmall, and undeniably covered--in most areas, at least--with some kind\r\nof fur, could not, logically, be anything but a strange kind of calf.\r\nBut--she stopped, and raised her head--if a calf, then where was the\r\ncall?\r\n\r\nPhildee\'s probe swept past the laboring mind directly into her\r\ntelepathic, instinctual centers.\r\n\r\nVoiceless, with their environment so favorable that it had never been\r\nnecessary for them to develop prehensile limbs, female people had\r\nnevertheless evolved a method of child care commensurate with their\r\ncomparatively higher intelligence.\r\n\r\nSoft as tender fingers, gentle as the human hand that smooths the awry\r\nhair back from the young forehead, Riya\'s mental caress enfolded\r\nPhildee.\r\n\r\nPhildee recoiled. The feeling was:\r\n\r\n    _Warm_\r\n    _Soft_\r\n    _Sweet_\r\n         Not _candy in the mouth_\r\n\r\n         _Candy in the mouth_\r\n    _Familiar_\r\n    _Good_\r\n    _Tasty_\r\n    _Nice_\r\n\r\n         _The feeling was_\r\n    _Not Familiar_\r\n    _Not Good_\r\n    _Not Tasty_\r\n    _Not Nice_\r\n\r\n    _WHY?_:\r\n\r\n    _M is for many motionless months._\r\n    _T is for tense temper tantrums._\r\n    _R is for rabid--NO!--rapid rolling wrench._\r\n\r\n    _MTR. Mother._\r\n\r\nPhildee\'s mother wanted Phildee\'s father. Phildee\'s mother wanted green\r\ngrass and apple trees, tight skirts and fur jackets on Fifth Avenue, men\r\nto turn and look, a little room where nobody could see her. Phildee\'s\r\nmother had radiation burns. Phildee\'s mother was dead.\r\n\r\nHe wavered; physically. Maintaining his position in this world was a\r\nprocess that demanded constant attention from the segment of his mind\r\ndevoted to it. For a moment, even that small group of brain cells almost\r\nbecame involved in his reaction.\r\n\r\nIt was that which snapped him back into functioning logically. MTR was\r\nMother. Mother was:\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Tall_\r\n    _Thin_\r\n    _White_\r\n    _Biped_\r\n\r\n   _"In Heaven\'s name, Doctor, when will this thing be over?"_\r\n\r\n    BL was Riya. Riya was:\r\n    _Big brown beast, looming large, looking lonely._\r\n    _BL=MTR_\r\n    _Equation not meaningful, not valid._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlmost resolved, only a few traces of the initial conflict remained.\r\nPhildee put the tips of his right fingers to his mouth. He dug his toe\r\ninto the ground, gouged a semicircular furrow, and smoothed it over with\r\nhis sole.\r\n\r\nRiya continued to look at him from where she was standing, two or three\r\nfeet away. Haltingly, she reached out her mind again--hesitating not\r\nbecause of fear of another such reaction on Phildee\'s part, for that had\r\nbeen far beyond her capacity to understand, but because even the\r\nslightest rebuff on the part of a child to a gesture as instinctive as a\r\nTerrestrial mother\'s caress was something that none of the people had\r\never encountered before.\r\n\r\nWhile her left-behind intellectual capacity still struggled to reconcile\r\nthe feel of childhood with a visual image of complete unfamiliarity, the\r\nwarm mind-caress went gently forth again.\r\n\r\nPhildee made up his mind. Ordinarily, he was immune to the small\r\nemotional problems that beclouded less rational intellects. He was\r\nunused to functioning in other than a cause/effect universe. Mothers\r\nwere usually--though sometimes not--matronly women who spent the greater\r\npart of roughly twenty years per child in conscious pre-occupation with,\r\nand/or subconscious or conscious rejection of, their offspring.\r\n\r\nIn his special case, Mother was a warm place, a frantic, hysteric voice,\r\nthe pressure of the spasmodically contractile musculature linked to her\r\nhyperthyroid metabolism. Mother was a thing from before birth.\r\n\r\nRiya--Riya bore a strong resemblance to an intelligent cow. In any\r\nphysiological sense, she could no more be his mother than--\r\n\r\nThe second caress found him not unaccustomed to it. It enfolded his\r\nconsciousness, tenderly, protectingly, empathetic.\r\n\r\nPhildee gave way to instinct.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe fur along the ridge of Riya\'s spine prickled with a well-remembered\r\nhappiness as she felt the hesitant answering surge in Phildee\'s mind.\r\nMoving surely forward, she nuzzled his face. Phildee grinned. He ran his\r\nfingers through the thick fur at the base of her short neck.\r\n\r\n_Big warm wall of brown fur._\r\n\r\n_Cool, happy nose._\r\n\r\n_Happy, happy, eyes._\r\n\r\nGreat joy welled up in Riya. No shameful trot across the mountains faced\r\nher now. No hesitant approach to the huddled, suspicious wildlings was\r\nbefore her. The danger of sharp female hooves to be avoided, of skulking\r\nat the edge of the herd in hope of an anxious male, was a thing no\r\nlonger to be half-fearfully approached.\r\n\r\nWith a nudge of her head, she directed Phildee down the path to the old\r\nrange while she herself turned around. She stood motionless for a\r\nsweeping scan of the plain below her. The couples were scattered over\r\nthe grass--but couples only, the females as yet unfulfilled.\r\n\r\nThis, too, was another joy to add to the greatest of all. So many things\r\nabout her calf were incomprehensible--the only dimly-felt overtones of\r\nprojected symbology that accompanied Phildee\'s emotional reactions, the\r\nalien structure--so many, many things. Her mind floundered vainly\r\nthrough the complex data.\r\n\r\nBut all that was nothing. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
What did it matter? The Time had been, and for\r\nanother season, she was a dam.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPhildee walked beside her down the path, one fist wrapped in the fur of\r\nher flank, short legs windmilling.\r\n\r\nThey reached the plain, and Riya struck out across it toward the\r\ngreatest concentration of people, her head proudly raised. She stopped\r\nonce, and deliberately cropped a mouthful of grass with unconcern, but\r\nresumed her pace immediately thereafter.\r\n\r\nWith the same unconcern, she nudged Phildee into the center of the group\r\nof people, and, ignoring them, began teaching her calf to feed.\r\n\r\n_Eat. (Picture of Phildee/calf on all fours, cropping the plains\r\ngrass.)_\r\n\r\nPhildee stared at her in puzzlement. Grass was not food. He sent the\r\ndata emphatically.\r\n\r\nRiya felt the tenuous discontent. She replied with tender understanding.\r\nSometimes the calf was hesitant.\r\n\r\n_Eat. (Gently, understandingly, but firmly. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
[Repetition of picture.])_\r\nShe bent her head and pushed him carefully over, then held his head down\r\nwith a gentle pressure of her muzzle. _Eat._\r\n\r\nPhildee squirmed. He slipped out from under her nose and regained his\r\nFeet. He looked at the other people, who were staring in puzzlement at\r\nRiya and himself.\r\n\r\nHe felt himself pushed forward again. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
_Eat._\r\n\r\nAbruptly, he realized the situation. In a culture of herbivores, what\r\nfood could there be but herbiage? There would be milk, in time, but not\r\nfor--he probed--months.\r\n\r\nIn probing, too, he found the visualization of his life with her ready\r\nat the surface of Riya\'s mind.\r\n\r\nThere was no shelter on the plain. His fur was all the shelter\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n_But I don\'t have any fur._\r\n\r\nIn the fall, they would move to the southern range.\r\n\r\n_Walk? A thousand miles?_\r\n\r\nHe would grow big and strong. In a year, he would be a sire himself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHis reaction was simple, and practiced. He adjusted his reality concept\r\nto Reimannian topology. Not actually, but subjectively, he felt himself\r\nbeginning to slip Earthward.\r\n\r\nRiya stiffened in alarm. The calf was straying. The knowledge was\r\nrelayed from her mother-centers to the telepathic functions.\r\n\r\n_Stop. You cannot go there. You must be with your mother. You are not\r\ngrown. Stop. Stay with me. I will protect you. I love you._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe universe shuddered. Phildee adjusted frantically. Cutting through\r\nthe delicately maintained reality concept was a scrambling, jamming\r\nfrequency of thought. In terror, he flung himself backward into Riya\'s\r\nworld. Standing completely still, he probed frantically into Riya\'s\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nAnd found her mind only fumblingly beginning to intellectualize the\r\nsimple formulization of what her instinctive centers had computed,\r\nsystematized, and activated before her conscious mind had even begun to\r\ndoubt that everything was well.\r\n\r\nHis mind accepted the data, and computed.\r\n\r\nHandless and voiceless, not so fast afoot in their bulkiness as the\r\nweakest month-old calf, the people had long ago evolved the restraints\r\nnecessary for rearing their children.\r\n\r\nIf the calf romped and ran, his mother ran beside him, and the calf was\r\nnot permitted to run faster than she. If a calf strayed from its\r\nsleeping mother, it strayed only so far, and then the mother woke--but\r\nthe calf had already long been held back by the time her intelligence\r\nawoke to the straying.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge and computations were fed in Phildee\'s rational centers.\r\nThe Universe--and Earth--were closed to him. He must remain here.\r\n\r\nBut human children could not survive in this environment.\r\n\r\nHe had to find a solution--instantly.\r\n\r\nHe clinched his fists, feeling his arm muscles quiver.\r\n\r\nHis lower lip was pulled into his mouth, and his teeth sank in.\r\n\r\nThe diagram--the pattern--bigger--stronger--try--try--this is not\r\nreal--_this_ is real: brown earth, white clouds, blue sky--try--mouth\r\nfull of warm salt ...\r\n\r\n    _F is for Phildee!_\r\n    _O is for Out!_\r\n    _R is for Riya!_\r\n    _T is for Topology!_\r\n    _H is for happiness and home!_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRiya shook herself. She stood in the furrows of a plowed field, her eyes\r\nvacant with bewilderment. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
She stared uncomprehendingly at the walls and\r\nthe radar tower, the concrete shoulders of the air raid bunkers. She saw\r\nantiaircraft quick-firers being hastily cranked around and down at her,\r\nheard Phildee\'s shout that saved her life, and understood none of it.\r\n\r\nBut none of it mattered. Her strange calf was with her, standing beside\r\nher with his fingers locked in her fur, and she could feel the warm\r\nresponse in his mind as she touched him with her caress again.\r\n\r\nShe saw the other little calves erupting out of the low dormitory\r\nbuildings, and something within her crooned.\r\n\r\nRiya nuzzled her foundling. She looked about her at the War Orphans\'\r\nRelocation Farm with her happy, happy eyes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s Riya\'s Foundling, by Algirdas Jonas Budrys\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
