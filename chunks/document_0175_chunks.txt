It was Danny who came up\r\n with the idea of leaving him with the prophecy--\r\n\r\n               Goodbye, Dead Man!\r\n\r\n               _by Tom W. Harris_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was Orley Mattup\'s killing of the old lab technician that really made\r\nus hate him.\r\n\r\nMattup was a guard at the reactor installation at Bayless, Kentucky,\r\nwhere my friend Danny Hern and I were part of the staff when the\r\nOutsiders took everything over. In what god-forsaken mountain hole they\r\nhad found Mattup, and how they got him to sell out to them, I don\'t\r\nknow. He was an authentic human, though. You can tell an Outsider.\r\n\r\nMattup and Danny and I were playing high-low-jack the night Uncle Pete\r\nwas killed, sitting on the widewalk where Mattup had a view of the part\r\nof the station he was responsible for. High-low-jack is a back-country\r\ncard game; Danny had learned it in northern Pennsylvania, where he came\r\nfrom, and Mattup loved the game, and they had taught it to me because\r\nthe game is better three-handed. The evening sessions had been Danny\'s\r\nidea--I think he figured it might give him a line on Mattup.\r\n\r\nOn the night in question, Mattup was on a week\'s losing streak and was\r\nin a foul humor. He was superstitious, and he had called for a new deck\r\ntwice that evening and walked around his seat four different times. His\r\nbidding was getting wilder.\r\n\r\n"You\'d better cool down," Danny told him. "Thing to do is ride out the\r\nbad luck, not fight it."\r\n\r\nOrley picked his nose and looked at his cards, "Bid four," he growled.\r\n\r\nFour is the highest possible bid. Tim played his cards well and he had\r\ngood ones. He had sewed up three of his points when we heard somebody\r\nmoving around down on the reactor floor. It was old Uncle Pete Barker,\r\none of the technicians.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"What you want down there?" bawled Mattup.\r\n\r\n"Just left my cap by the control room," said Uncle Pete, "and thought\r\nI\'d go get it."\r\n\r\n"You keep the hell away from there," grunted Mattup.\r\n\r\nUncle Pete stopped and stood gazing up at us. We went on playing. It was\r\nthe last card of the hand, and would either win the game for Mattup or\r\nlose it for him. Orley slapped his card down; it was a crucial card, the\r\njack. Danny took it with a queen and Mattup had lost the game.\r\n\r\nI felt like clearing out. Mattup\'s face was purple and his eyes looked\r\nlike wolves\' eyes. He glared at Danny, making a noise in his throat, and\r\nthen I saw his gaze leave Danny and go to something down by the reactor.\r\n\r\nIt was Uncle Pete, shuffling along toward the control room.\r\n\r\nMattup didn\'t say a word. He stood up and unholstered the thing the\r\nOutsiders had given him and pointed it at Uncle Pete. There was a\r\nringing in our ears and Uncle Pete began to twist. Something inside him\r\ntwisted him, twisting inside his arms, his legs, head, trunk, even his\r\nfingers. It was only for a few seconds. Then the ringing stopped, and\r\nUncle Pete sunk to the ground, and there was the silence and the smell.\r\n\r\nMattup made us leave the body there until we had played two more hands.\r\nDanny won one; he was a man with good nerves. When we were back in our\r\nroom he said, "That did it--I\'m going to get that guy."\r\n\r\n"I hate his big thick guts," I said, buttoning my pajama shirt, "but how\r\nare you going to get him?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll get him," said Danny.

"Meanwhile, we\'ll keep playing cards."\r\n\r\nThings went on almost normally at the Bayless reactor. It was a\r\nprivately-owned pool-type reactor, and we were sent samples of all sorts\r\nof material for irradiation from all over the country. Danny was one of\r\nthe irradiation men; I generally handled controlling. The Outsiders had\r\nfilled the place with telescreens and guards, and all mail was opened,\r\nbut there was no real interference with the work. I began to worry a\r\nlittle about Danny. Almost every afternoon he spent an hour alone in our\r\nroom, with the door closed.\r\n\r\nMattup kept getting worse; an animal with power. He used to go hunting\r\nwith the damnable Outsider weapon, although the meat killed with it\r\nwasn\'t fit to eat, and he used it on birds until there wasn\'t one left\r\nanywhere near the plant. He never killed a bluebird, though. He said it\r\nwas bad luck. Sometimes he drank moonshine corn liquor, usually alone,\r\nbecause the Outsiders wouldn\'t touch it, but sometimes he made some of\r\nus drink with him, watching sharply to see we didn\'t poison him and\r\ncraftily picking his nose. When he was drunk he was abusive.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne night we were in our room, dead for sleep after a long game, and\r\nDanny said, "Let me show you something."\r\n\r\nHe shuffled the cards, I cut, and he dealt me an ace, king, queen, jack,\r\nten and deuce of spades. He shuffled again and dealt me the same in\r\nhearts.\r\n\r\n"Watch as closely as you can," he grinned. "See if you can catch me."\r\n\r\nI couldn\'t.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been practicing," he said. "I\'m going to get Mattup."\r\n\r\n"What good will it do to beat him in cards? You\'ll only make him sore."\r\nI was relieved to learn what Danny had been doing, alone in our room,\r\nbut this card-sharp angle didn\'t make much sense to me.\r\n\r\n"Who says I\'m going to beat him at cards?" smiled Danny. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
"By the way,\r\ndid you hear the rumor? They\'re going to break up the staff, Outsider\r\npolicy, send us to Oak Ridge, Argonne, Shippingport, send new people\r\ndown here."\r\n\r\n"That doesn\'t leave you much time," I said.\r\n\r\n"Time enough," said Danny.\r\n\r\nThe next night Mattup began a fantastic streak of luck. It seemed he\r\ncouldn\'t lose, and he was as unpleasant a winner as he was a loser.\r\n\r\n"You boys don\'t know what card-playin\' is," he\'d gloat. "Think you\'re\r\npretty smarty with all that science stuff but you can\'t win a plain old\r\ncard game. You know why you can\'t beat me, boys?"\r\n\r\n"Because you\'re too smart, I guess," said Danny.\r\n\r\n"Well, yeah, and somethin\' else. I dipped my hands in spunk water, up on\r\nthe mountain where you can never find it, and besides that I spit on\r\never\' card in this deck and wiped it off. Couldn\'t lose now to save my\r\nlife."\r\n\r\n"Maybe you\'re right," said Danny, and went on dealing.\r\n\r\nIn a few days the rumor of moving was confirmed; I was being sent to Oak\r\nRidge, Danny to Argonne. Mattup kept winning, and "suggested" that we\r\nraise the stakes. By the day that we were to leave we owed him every\r\ncent we had.\r\n\r\nI paid up soberly; I wouldn\'t give Mattup any satisfaction by\r\ncomplaining. It looked as though Danny wasn\'t going to "get" Mattup\r\nafter all. But Danny surprised me.\r\n\r\n"Look, buster," he wheedled. "If I pay you seventy-five bucks I won\'t\r\nhave a cent left. How about me paying half now and the rest later?"\r\n\r\n"No good," said Mattup. "You got it--pay me. If you can\'t pay cash gimme\r\nyour watch. I know you got one."\r\n\r\n"Look, buster--"\r\n\r\n"Quit callin\' me buster."\r\n\r\n"What am I going to live on until I get paid again?

=== Chunk 4 ===
"\r\n\r\n"What do I care?"\r\n\r\nIt went on like that until the busses for the airport were nearly ready\r\nto leave and both men seemed angry enough to kill each other.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s go," I begged Danny. "Pay him and leave."\r\n\r\n"All right then!" Danny snapped, and pulled out his wallet. He counted\r\nout all his bills into Mattup\'s hand.\r\n\r\n"You\'re a buck short," said Mattup.\r\n\r\n"Why not forget the buck?" said Danny. "You can spare it."\r\n\r\n"You\'re a buck short," repeated Mattup, scowling.\r\n\r\nDanny dashed his wallet to the ground. "You\'re even taking my change!"\r\nHe got his jacket from the back of a chair--it was a hot day--and\r\nemptied change from the side pocket.\r\n\r\nThere were two quarters and a half dollar, and he paid them over. "I\r\nhave eleven cents left," he said. "Hell, take that too. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
I don\'t give a\r\ndamn."\r\n\r\nMattup grinned. "Sure I\'ll take it--if you weren\'t lying when you said I\r\ncould have it."\r\n\r\n"It\'ll break me," said Danny.\r\n\r\n"I know it," said Mattup. "Gonna break your promise?"\r\n\r\nThe bus driver was honking. "The hell with you," Danny said to Mattup,\r\nand gave him a dime and a penny. He looked Mattup in the eye with a\r\nstrange expression. "Now, I gave you that and you didn\'t win it. You\r\ntook it of your own free will. I offered it to you and you took it.\r\nRight?"\r\n\r\n"Right," said Mattup. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
"Sucker."\r\n\r\nWe scrambled on the bus and as it pulled away Danny yelled "Hey, Buster,\r\nlook!" Mattup looked, and Danny stuck his right arm out the window,\r\npointing at Mattup with his right forefinger and his little finger stuck\r\nout straight and parallel, the thumb tucked under. A strange, disturbed\r\nlook came over Orley. He turned his back as the bus roared out of the\r\ndrive.\r\n\r\nAt the airport Danny popped into a phone-booth and got Orley on the\r\nline--nobody seemed to care, either Outsiders or guards--and he let me\r\nlisten.\r\n\r\n"Spent your money yet, dead man?" purred Danny.\r\n\r\n"Whacha mean, dead man?" gruffed Orley\'s voice. "You crazy or\r\nsomething?"\r\n\r\n"You know that eleven cents extra you took?" gloated Danny. "It\'s gonna\r\nkill you, Buster, for killing Uncle Pete, and for everything else you\'ve\r\ndone. I know. I\'ve been talking nights to Uncle Pete. You\'re a dead\r\nduck, Orley Mattup! Dead!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s--I don\'t believe it, it\'s baloney! I\'m going to spend that\r\neleven cents and get rid of it."\r\n\r\n"You do exactly that, Buster. I locked the curse on it, and I made the\r\nsign on you, and you have to keep that eleven cents the rest of your\r\nlife. If you spend it--or if you lose it, and you will lose it--that\'s\r\nthe end of you.

=== Chunk 7 ===
"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll come out there and pound the hell out of you!" yelled Mattup.\r\n\r\n"Too late, Buster, our planes are leaving. Goodbye, dead man!

=== Chunk 8 ===
"\r\n\r\nAnd we had to run for our planes. Danny\'s pitch sounded pretty weak to\r\nme, even though Orley was superstitious, but I didn\'t get to tell Danny\r\nthat until nearly five years later.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"I think I got him," said Danny. "You don\'t know the whole thing."\r\n\r\nA hotel clerk had been listening. "You mean Orley Mattup, the guard? He\r\ngot sick, and said he had a hex on him, and took off one day and a lot\r\nlater they found him up on the mountain. He was dead."\r\n\r\n"Any money on him?" asked Danny.\r\n\r\n"Jest some change. They buried it with him; they heard the hex was\r\nlocked onto that money."\r\n\r\n"Congratulations," I told Danny. "I didn\'t think it\'d work. You scared\r\nhim to death."\r\n\r\n"Not quite," said Danny. "I scared him into hanging onto the money. That\r\nmoney would have killed anybody that carried it much longer than the few\r\nminutes I handled it. I\'d been keeping the stuff in the reactor beam\r\ntubes.
