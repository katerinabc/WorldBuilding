It was axiomatic. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
What had to be\r\ndone, had to be done. A forged pass, with 48 hours of alleged validity\r\ngleaming brightly in red letters under the plastic overlaminate was\r\nbetter than no pass. And an outdated pass would wipe away a week\'s work\r\nin the underground.\r\n\r\nThe sharp, massive gray outline of the Pentagon loomed before him, dark\r\nand foreboding against the sky. The brightly lighted entrance through\r\nwhich he must gain admittance resembled the glowing peep-hole into the\r\ninferno of an atomic drive.\r\n\r\nRuy\'s stomach hardened, then exploded in a surge of bitter, stringent\r\ngastric juices as the MP glanced at his pass, scrutinized his face, and\r\nthen turned his attention toward others coming through the entrance.\r\n\r\nRuy wanted to run and hide. His dark blue uniform seemed to shrink\r\ntighter and tighter. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
The misfit must be apparent from the back. The\r\nsilvery commander\'s insignia on his jacket weighed heavily at his\r\nchest and at his heart. He wished desperately for one fleeting, but\r\nexcruciating, moment that he were back on his ship, in his own uniform,\r\nat the control panel of his computer.\r\n\r\nHe started off to the right in a seeming trance. The first step had\r\nbeen taken. His many hours of thought, study and planning would carry\r\nhim from here.\r\n\r\nThis was the only way. He had repeated the fact over and over. It was\r\nan ugly business, but had to be done. Five years of war was enough.\r\nMan was on his knees before the invaders from outer space; but they in\r\nturn had been too long from home and were near the breaking point. A\r\ncontinued drain would mean defeat for both sides. Ruy could turn the\r\ntide, but very probably his life would be the minimum sacrifice.\r\n\r\nHe had decided his fate long before he left the decks of his ship.\r\nOnly the belligerent pride of statesmen, and the steadfast belief in\r\nthe infallability of their computers, kept the two great battle fleets\r\ndrawn in null position against each other. The computers, perhaps,\r\ndeserved such ultimate confidence--in theory. They always predicted\r\noptimum maneuver envelopes, always predicted mobilization rates to\r\ndevelop force fields designed to offset those of the enemy. And they\r\nalways kept battle losses to a minimum--merely dribbling away the\r\nresources of the solar system. Yet in five years of such optimum\r\nmaneuvering, not a single battle had been won.\r\n\r\nTwo doors gave way before Ruy\'s pocket vibrator, the lock tumblers\r\nslipping and turning freely in a mad frenzy to escape the resonating\r\nhum. A short, windowless corridor lay before him, broken only by a\r\nmassive door at the other end. Beyond that door lay Ruy\'s objective.\r\n\r\nThe guard never had time to do more than note Ruy\'s presence in this\r\nsanctum sanctorum. The needle thin spray of a paralyzing drug made his\r\nbody feel stiff, unmanageable, and peculiarly buoyant, as though he\r\nwere being hurled through space. His thoughts became blurred and then\r\nafter a blinding flash, complete oblivion set in.\r\n\r\nThe two officers seated at the control panels of the master computer\r\nexperienced similar depression of their cardiovascular systems and\r\nmedullae.\r\n\r\nSmall thermite igniters pressed against the door lock and hinges fused\r\nthe steel door to its frame.\r\n\r\nWith the smell of scorched paint still stinging his nostrils, Ruy\r\nseated himself at the control panel, dabbed his left wrist with\r\nstringent antiseptic, gripped his hand into a fist, and plunged the\r\nsilver probes deep into the nerves of his wrist.\r\n\r\nGlancing through the observation window into the battle plotting room\r\nbelow, he studied the positions of the fleets as they appeared on the\r\nlarge wall diagram of the solar system.\r\n\r\nDisregarding the distraction offered by the moving figures of the few\r\nofficers and technicians on duty by the map, he fixed the positions of\r\nthe fleets into his mind. He would have need for a clear visual picture\r\nuntil he adapted to the mental images the computer would feed into his\r\nbrain. He worked with furious haste, yet each step was meticulously\r\nprecise--everything depended on his grasping the reins of battle\r\nfrom the computer and successfully twisting its authority to his own\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nGrasping the viewing switch, he threw it on. Pinpoints of light flared\r\ndeep within his brain and seemed to blot his vision. Closing his eyes,\r\nhis brain fought for perspective. Gradually, it focused and perceived\r\nthe solar system, resplendent with sun, planets, moons, and men of war.\r\nEnveloping each ship were lines of force, scintillating sharp and hard;\r\nforming cosmic vortexes as the lesser computers on board followed the\r\nmaster\'s directives and distorted the ether around the ships, seeking\r\nto build a pattern to penetrate the opposing fields and engulf the\r\nenemy men of war.\r\n\r\nA moment, and the game was on. Ruy grasped the "Manual" switch before\r\nhim, pulled hard, and dropped his hands to the keyboard before him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe General, who was known in military circles as a good Joe, but a\r\nstickler for the theory of war, relaxed languidly at his desk in the\r\nsmall office off the Battle Room. The other officers on duty milled\r\naround the plotting board within his eyesight awaiting the end of the\r\nevening shift.\r\n\r\nIt was strange and new to relax on the job after so many years of fleet\r\nduty. But staff duty to the master computer was good, politically. He\r\nwas getting along in years, and a few more contacts here might mean a\r\nseparate fleet command of his own, perhaps in pursuit of the invader,\r\nif the computers could ever break the deadlock.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, the sweet reverie of the General was snapped like a tight\r\ntension cable. A gong on the wall clanged rapidly three times and a\r\nred flashing light next to the gong told him what his ears refused to\r\nbelieve. The computer had been switched to manual. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
He had received no\r\nsuch instructions. In fact, the computer hadn\'t been on manual since\r\nthe war started.\r\n\r\n"Captain, who ordered manual control?" he barked as he sprang to the\r\ndoorway of the Battle Room.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, Sir," stammered the Captain. His manner and bearing were\r\nthose of a man who had just been faced with a problem of cataclysmic\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\n"Well check with the control room--on the double--before our fleet gets\r\nout of defensive position." His parade ground roar snapped the Captain\r\nout of the catelepsy which had enveloped him and sent him scurrying\r\ninto the corridor.\r\n\r\nAn almost hysterical shout whirled the General back to the plotting\r\nboard.\r\n\r\n"Sir, our fleet is attacking--_attacking!_"\r\n\r\n"What? Where?" 

=== Chunk 5 ===
asked the General, his eyes darting over the board in a\r\nfrantic effort to orient himself.\r\n\r\n"Here, Sir, see. The positions are changing gradually in an unusual\r\npattern. A patrol ship, a destroyer, and a cruiser have all gone right\r\ninto the enemy vortex field," analyzed the Major.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I see--But with the enemy concentrating his ships\r\northogonally--he\'ll build a vortex that will disintegrate each and\r\nevery ship of ours near the vortex," said the General, his mind coming\r\nup to full battle speed as it grasped the situation. "My God! 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Can\'t\r\nthey see that they\'re going to certain death?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA gong sounded in a muffled sort of way in the plotting room below Ruy,\r\nas a gentle buzz told him that the computer had relinquished control.\r\n\r\nHis fingers began to play rapidly over the keys. Swift orders of\r\nstrategy were transmitted through steel conduits deep into the computer\r\nvaults of the building. There, the orders were transposed into detailed\r\ntactics and beamed throughout the solar system. And as his fingers\r\nlimbered to the keys, he played a deadly tune, a concerto of death.\r\n\r\nThe fleet grew alive with a sudden awareness; it seemed to be a thing\r\nalive, straining at its bonds in response to the music played into its\r\ncomputers and controls. Suddenly, the fleet sprang forward. A destroyer\r\nshot out into the midst of the enemy fleet, launching all of its energy\r\nin one tremendous lurch--only to go down in a flaming wreck as the\r\nenemy ships swerved and concentrated on it. And a second ship, and then\r\na third ship repeated the frightful maneuver, until the whole heavens\r\nwere lighted with the flaming novae of berserk atomic drives.\r\n\r\n"General, sir," said the Lieutenant, with sweat rolling from his brow\r\nas he saluted.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Lieutenant," said the General looking away from the battle map of\r\nthe solar system.\r\n\r\n"We can\'t make any headway against the control room door. Must be solid\r\nsteel. Whoever got in there must have fused it shut."\r\n\r\n"Well, get a welding torch," said the General, his eyes going back to\r\nwatch the devastation of the fleet. "We\'ve got to get in--get that\r\ncomputer back on automatic. Get explosives, if necessary."\r\n\r\n"We\'ve sent for a welding torch already, sir. It\'ll be here in a few\r\nminutes."\r\n\r\n"All right. Send someone for hand grenades too. We\'ve got to stop this\r\nsabotage before the fleet is annihilated. They\'re losing ships every\r\nminute."\r\n\r\n"Sir," interposed the Captain standing nearby, "maybe we can cut off\r\nthe computer room someway. I know it\'s a direct conduit, right to the\r\nvaults from the control room, but maybe we can cut the conduits and let\r\nthe ships fall back on their emergency circuits."\r\n\r\n"Looks like a possible alternative, Captain, though we\'d put the\r\ncomputer out of operation for several days," said the General. "But\r\nwe\'re losing our fleet this way."\r\n\r\nSeven, eight, nine great men of war went down before the blazing force\r\nfields of the enemy, who pounced on every sacrifice offered to it by\r\nthe computer.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant turned his eyes from the incandescent glare of the thick\r\nsteel conduit glowing red under the finger of the acetylene torch.\r\n"General, its extremely resistant to cutting. I doubt if we can cut\r\nthrough it before they finally get the door and frame cut away up in\r\nthe control room."\r\n\r\n"Keep at it, boy. We\'ve got to get through at the saboteur one way or\r\nanother. Do the best you can. The boys in the fleet are counting on\r\nyou. They\'re going down to certain death while we delay."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith the last terms of the new equations of strategy played into the\r\ncomputer, Ruy sat back, gave a sigh, opened his eyes, and slipped the\r\nelectrodes from his wrist. His job was almost done. If he could keep\r\nthe others from this control panel for another half hour, the computer\r\ncould operate on his equations fully, and the battle would be won.\r\n\r\nThe first ships from Earth had already gone down in flames, expendable\r\nsacrifices to his purpose. But they were not dying in vain. The end\r\nresult would be--must be--victory.\r\n\r\n_Wars are fought by strategy, but also by sacrifice. Every general must\r\nsend troops into battle, must expect to sacrifice to make the enemy\r\ncommit himself in the desired way, and so make victory possible._\r\n\r\nThis was what Ruy believed. He believed it deeply, deeply enough to\r\nthrow aside his career as a rising young theoretical mathematics\r\nofficer of the fleet and to go over the heads of his unconvinced\r\nsuperiors, with all their unread reports and unanswered recommendations\r\nfrom subordinates, in the only way a man of action could--by taking\r\nthings into his own hands, and staking his life on the gamble.\r\n\r\nThe General, eyes riveted to the board, winced with pain as ship after\r\nship roiled the heavens with flaming death. And as he watched, a\r\ngradual subtle design became apparent. For every ship he had lost, his\r\nships had taken a similar tally--for each sacrifice, a trap was sprung\r\nand a similar toll taken. Computers did not sacrifice, did not send men\r\nout to certain death. Therefore a sacrifice was greedily snapped up\r\nas a mistake of the enemy. And such greed snapped the trap. One move\r\nforced the next, once the bait was taken.\r\n\r\nAs the theme of the theory formed in the General\'s mind, he suddenly\r\nmuttered: "Even exchange will balance a computer\'s potential--but a\r\nseries of forced, even-exchanges can distort a fleet\'s position from\r\noptimum.... I never realized it before--an optimum move is not an\r\noptimum move--if it\'s a forced move."\r\n\r\nHe turned from the board and spoke quietly to the men who stood in\r\nhushed groups watching the flaming battle.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen, we are winning a great victory; the war will soon be over."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe door to the computer room toppled outward, frame and all, after\r\nseveral ceaseless hours of cutting. The impact left the hallway of\r\narmed men silent and still, like specters in the unreal light from the\r\nglowing acetylene torch. Just inside the doorway stood a man, his youth\r\nbelied by wise and thoughtful eyes, grinding a cigarette under his\r\nfoot. And as he stepped through the wrecked and twisted door frame not\r\na hand was raised against him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
