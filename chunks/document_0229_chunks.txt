He caught up with his guest at the\r\nfoot of the stairs.\r\n\r\n"Here, I\'ll show you the way," he said.\r\n\r\n"No, I can find it myself, thank you," the Martian assured him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSomething rather final in the Martian\'s tone made the Professor desist,\r\nand after watching his visitor sway up the stairs with an almost\r\nhypnotic softly jogging movement, he rejoined his wife in the study,\r\nsaying wonderingly, "Who\'d have thought it, by George! Function taboos\r\nas strict as our own!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad some of your professional visitors maintain \'em," his wife\r\nsaid darkly.\r\n\r\n"But this one\'s from Mars, darling, and to find out he\'s--well, similar\r\nin an aspect of his life is as thrilling as the discovery that water is\r\nburned hydrogen. When I think of the day not far distant when I\'ll put\r\nhis entries in the cross-cultural index ..."\r\n\r\nHe was still rhapsodizing when the Professor\'s Little Son raced in.\r\n\r\n"Pop, the Martian\'s gone to the bathroom!"\r\n\r\n"Hush, dear. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
Manners."\r\n\r\n"Now it\'s perfectly natural, darling, that the boy should notice and be\r\nexcited. Yes, Son, the Martian\'s not so very different from us."\r\n\r\n"Oh, certainly," the Professor\'s Wife said with a trace of bitterness.\r\n"I don\'t imagine his turquoise complexion will cause any comment at all\r\nwhen you bring him to a faculty reception. They\'ll just figure he\'s had\r\na hard night--and that he got that baby-elephant nose sniffing around\r\nfor assistant professorships."\r\n\r\n"Really, darling! He probably thinks of our noses as disagreeably\r\namputated and paralyzed."\r\n\r\n"Well, anyway, Pop, he\'s in the bathroom. I followed him when he\r\nsquiggled upstairs."\r\n\r\n"Now, Son, you shouldn\'t have done that. He\'s on a strange planet and it\r\nmight make him nervous if he thought he was being spied on. We must show\r\nhim every courtesy. By George, I can\'t wait to discuss these things with\r\nAckerly-Ramsbottom! When I think of how much more this encounter has to\r\ngive the anthropologist than even the physicist or astronomer ..."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHe was still going strong on his second rhapsody when he was interrupted\r\nby another high-speed entrance. It was the Professor\'s Coltish Daughter.\r\n\r\n"Mom, Pop, the Martian\'s--"\r\n\r\n"Hush, dear. We know."\r\n\r\nThe Professor\'s Coltish Daughter regained her adolescent poise, which\r\nwas considerable. "Well, he\'s still in there," she said. "I just tried\r\nthe door and it was locked."\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad it was!" the Professor said while his wife added, "Yes, you\r\ncan\'t be sure what--" and caught herself. "Really, dear, that was very\r\nbad manners."\r\n\r\n"I thought he\'d come downstairs long ago," her daughter explained. "He\'s\r\nbeen in there an awfully long time. It must have been a half hour ago\r\nthat I saw him gyre and gimbal upstairs in that real gone way he has,\r\nwith Nosy here following him." The Professor\'s Coltish Daughter was\r\ncurrently soaking up both jive and _Alice_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the Professor checked his wristwatch, his expression grew troubled.\r\n"By George, he is taking his time! Though, of course, we don\'t know how\r\nmuch time Martians ... I wonder."\r\n\r\n"I listened for a while, Pop," his son volunteered. "He was running the\r\nwater a lot."\r\n\r\n"Running the water, eh? We know Mars is a water-starved planet. I\r\nsuppose that in the presence of unlimited water, he might be seized by a\r\nkind of madness and ... But he seemed so well adjusted."\r\n\r\nThen his wife spoke, voicing all their thoughts. Her outlook on life\r\ngave her a naturally sepulchral voice.\r\n\r\n"_What\'s he doing in there?_"\r\n\r\nTwenty minutes and at least as many fantastic suggestions later, the\r\nProfessor glanced again at his watch and nerved himself for action.\r\nMotioning his family aside, he mounted the stairs and tiptoed down the\r\nhall.\r\n\r\nHe paused only once to shake his head and mutter under his breath, "By\r\nGeorge, I wish I had Fenchurch or von Gottschalk here. They\'re a shade\r\nbetter than I am on intercultural contracts, especially taboo-breakings\r\nand affronts ..."\r\n\r\nHis family followed him at a short distance.\r\n\r\nThe Professor stopped in front of the bathroom door. Everything was\r\nquiet as death.\r\n\r\nHe listened for a minute and then rapped measuredly, steadying his hand\r\nby clutching its wrist with the other. There was a faint splashing, but\r\nno other sound.\r\n\r\nAnother minute passed. The Professor rapped again. Now there was no\r\nresponse at all. He very gingerly tried the knob. The door was still\r\nlocked.\r\n\r\nWhen they had retreated to the stairs, it was the Professor\'s Wife who\r\nonce more voiced their thoughts. This time her voice carried overtones\r\nof supernatural horror.\r\n\r\n"_What\'s he doing in there?_"\r\n\r\n"He may be dead or dying," the Professor\'s Coltish Daughter suggested\r\nbriskly. "Maybe we ought to call the Fire Department, like they did for\r\nold Mrs. Frisbee."\r\n\r\nThe Professor winced. "I\'m afraid you haven\'t visualized the\r\ncomplications, dear," he said gently. "No one but ourselves knows that\r\nthe Martian is on Earth, or has even the slightest inkling that\r\ninterplanetary travel has been achieved. Whatever we do, it will have to\r\nbe on our own. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
But to break in on a creature engaged in--well, we don\'t\r\nknow what primal private activity--is against all anthropological\r\npractice. Still--"\r\n\r\n"Dying\'s a primal activity," his daughter said crisply.\r\n\r\n"So\'s ritual bathing before mass murder," his wife added.\r\n\r\n"Please! Still, as I was about to say, we do have the moral duty to\r\nsuccor him if, as you all too reasonably suggest, he has been\r\nincapacitated by a germ or virus or, more likely, by some simple\r\nenvironmental factor such as Earth\'s greater gravity."\r\n\r\n"Tell you what, Pop--I can look in the bathroom window and see what he\'s\r\ndoing. All I have to do is crawl out my bedroom window and along the\r\ngutter a little ways. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
It\'s safe as houses."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Professor\'s question beginning with, "Son, how do you know--" died\r\nunuttered and he refused to notice the words his daughter was voicing\r\nsilently at her brother. He glanced at his wife\'s sardonically composed\r\nface, thought once more of the Fire Department and of other and larger\r\nand even more jealous--or would it be skeptical?--government agencies,\r\nand clutched at the straw offered him.\r\n\r\nTen minutes later, he was quite unnecessarily assisting his son back\r\nthrough the bedroom window.\r\n\r\n"Gee, Pop, I couldn\'t see a sign of him. That\'s why I took so long. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Hey,\r\nPop, don\'t look so scared. He\'s in there, sure enough. It\'s just that\r\nthe bathtub\'s under the window and you have to get real close up to see\r\ninto it."\r\n\r\n"The Martian\'s taking a bath?"\r\n\r\n"Yep. Got it full up and just the end of his little old schnozzle\r\nsticking out. Your suit, Pop, was hanging on the door."\r\n\r\nThe one word the Professor\'s Wife spoke was like a death knell.\r\n\r\n"_Drowned!_"\r\n\r\n"No, Ma, I don\'t think so. His schnozzle was opening and closing regular\r\nlike."\r\n\r\n"Maybe he\'s a shape-changer," the Professor\'s Coltish Daughter said in a\r\nburst of evil fantasy. "Maybe he softens in water and thins out after a\r\nwhile until he\'s like an eel and then he\'ll go exploring through the\r\nsewer pipes. Wouldn\'t it be funny if he went under the street and\r\nknocked on the stopper from underneath and crawled into the bathtub with\r\nPresident Rexford, or Mrs. President Rexford, or maybe right into the\r\nmiddle of one of Janey Rexford\'s Oh-I\'m-so-sexy bubble baths?"\r\n\r\n"Please!" The Professor put his hand to his eyebrows and kept it there,\r\ncuddling the elbow in his other hand.\r\n\r\n"Well, have you thought of something?" the Professor\'s Wife asked him\r\nafter a bit. "What are you going to do?"\r\n\r\nThe Professor dropped his hand and blinked his eyes hard and took a deep\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\n"Telegraph Fenchurch and Ackerly-Ramsbottom and then break in," he said\r\nin a resigned voice, into which, nevertheless, a note of hope seemed\r\nalso to have come. "First, however, I\'m going to wait until morning."\r\n\r\nAnd he sat down cross-legged in the hall a few yards from the bathroom\r\ndoor and folded his arms.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo the long vigil commenced.\r\n\r\nThe Professor\'s family shared it and he offered no objection. Other and\r\nsterner men, he told himself, might claim to be able successfully to\r\norder their children to go to bed when there was a Martian locked in the\r\nbathroom, but he would like to see them faced with the situation.\r\n\r\nFinally dawn began to seep from the bedrooms. When the bulb in the hall\r\nhad grown quite dim, the Professor unfolded his arms.\r\n\r\nJust then, there was a loud splashing in the bathroom. The Professor\'s\r\nfamily looked toward the door. The splashing stopped and they heard the\r\nMartian moving around. Then the door opened and the Martian appeared in\r\nthe Professor\'s gray pin-stripe suit. His mouth curled sharply downward\r\nin a broad alien smile as he saw the Professor.\r\n\r\n"Good morning!" the Martian said happily. "I never slept better in my\r\nlife, even in my own little wet bed back on Mars."\r\n\r\nHe looked around more closely and his mouth straightened. "But where did\r\nyou all sleep?" he asked. "Don\'t tell me you stayed dry all night! You\r\n_didn\'t_ give up your only bed to me?"\r\n\r\nHis mouth curled upward in misery. "Oh, dear," he said, "I\'m afraid I\'ve\r\nmade a mistake somehow. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Yet I don\'t understand how. Before I studied\r\nyou, I didn\'t know what your sleeping habits would be, but that question\r\nwas answered for me--in fact, it looked so reassuringly homelike--when I\r\nsaw those brief TV scenes of your females ready for sleep in their\r\nlittle tubs. Of course, on Mars, only the fortunate can always be sure\r\nof sleeping wet, but here, with your abundance of water, I thought there\r\nwould be wet beds for all."\r\n\r\nHe paused. "It\'s true I had some doubts last night, wondering if I\'d\r\nused the right words and all, but then when you rapped \'Good night\' to\r\nme, I splashed the sentiment back at you and went to sleep in a wink.\r\nBut I\'m afraid that somewhere I\'ve blundered and--"\r\n\r\n"No, no, dear chap," the Professor managed to say. He had been waving\r\nhis hand in a gentle circle for some time in token that he wanted to\r\ninterrupt. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
"Everything is quite all right. It\'s true we stayed up all\r\nnight, but please consider that as a watch--an honor guard, by\r\nGeorge!--which we kept to indicate our esteem."\r\n\r\n                                                        --FRITZ LEIBER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Galaxy Science Fiction_ December 1957.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.
