It was a day soft and clear; a day accepted by the young,\r\ncherished by we old. Across the gently undulating hills stood the\r\nmagnificent Melopolis, encradling the Oracle of Delni. I do not, of\r\ncourse, believe in the gods per se; still there is a grandeur in the\r\nvery stones that transcends their human sculptors, and it is no wonder\r\nto me that many cling tenaciously, and ignorantly, to the old religion.\r\nCling to the gods of old, who drew man upward from wherever he began.\r\nIn whose names Man killed and plundered, while struggling up. In whose\r\nnames Man finally left this earth, to seek his cousins among the stars.\r\n\r\nBut of course there were no cousins. There was nothing. And Man\r\nreturned, and settled down to live. Saddened, but resigned and content\r\nto live in peace with his knowledge and his power. Gone now are all the\r\nancient evils, wars, emergencies.\r\n\r\n"Sias! Sias--" And they were upon me.\r\n\r\nThat is, Xeon was upon me. But I knew that where Xeon is, Melia must\r\nsoon appear. And indeed it was but a moment before Melia slipped\r\nthrough the high grass to stand at his side. Their youthful voices were\r\nbabbling in excitement.\r\n\r\nMelia was a She, with the swelling breasts that were, so tradition\r\nstates, quite prevalent among members of the race long ago, and are\r\nseldom seen today. Indeed, Melia was on this account made the butt of\r\nmany jokes and, I fear, would have had a lonely life of it had it not\r\nbeen for the friendship of Xeon.\r\n\r\n"Sias," they were saying, "the Maternite\'s gone."\r\n\r\nI stared in amazement.\r\n\r\n"Gone? 

=== Chunk 2 ===
It cannot be gone. It has always been--"\r\n\r\n"Oh my gods!" Xeon shouted. "I tell you it\'s gone! Will you--"\r\n\r\nMelia interrupted him quietly. "Xeon, will you lose all respect for\r\nthe Elder?" Then turned to me, and said calmly, "The watcher at the\r\nMaternite Machine, it appears, has been drunk. The heat rose above the\r\nwarning, continued to rise, and then--poof. Everything has evaporated\r\nin Maternite. All the Prelife is gone."\r\n\r\n"All of it?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"There is nothing left," Melia insisted. "Can more be made? And if not,\r\nwhat will happen with no more children?"\r\n\r\n"That is for the priests to say, not I," I replied. In moments of\r\nemergency, it is wise to speak with caution. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
That is, I suppose so. I\r\nhave never before been in a real emergency.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA man my age does not hurry in the heat of the midday sun--maddugs\r\nnenglishmin go out in the midday sun, as the ancients say, although I\r\noften wonder why--but Xeon and Melia ran all the way down to the city.\r\nThey are of an age to enter manhood, and have all the energy such young\r\nmen do.\r\n\r\nAs we entered the city, we were surrounded by confusion and\r\nconsternation. And can the simple people be blamed? 

=== Chunk 4 ===
They were aware\r\nthat they stood in the midst of an unprecedented happening; indeed, an\r\nemergency. For a machine had failed!\r\n\r\nNot in the memory of the eldest among us has a machine failed. They\r\nwere created so long ago, indeed, that the ignorant believe them\r\nto have been constructed by the gods themselves. And never, so far\r\nas I know, has one failed. Small wonder that the watcher had been\r\nnegligent. Indeed, the watcher is more a tradition than a necessity.\r\nBesides, had he been sober, he would not have known what to do. For who\r\nknows the mysterious workings of the machines?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI hastened to the City Hall and found the Conclave assembled, waiting\r\nfor me to bring them to order. Xeon and Melia stopped as I mounted the\r\nsteps, but I smiled and motioned them in. They accompanied me past\r\nthe marble pillars into the cool recesses of the Hall, then seated\r\nthemselves on the floor as I took my place by the great table.\r\n\r\nWell, you know how these things are. At such a time, many men feel\r\nimpelled to make speeches, and one must not be disrespectful. Prayers\r\nand supplications were offered to the gods, priests were sent to\r\nsacrifice, and finally, as the light of the sun was falling between the\r\npillars, the High Priest of the Maternite Machine was heard.\r\n\r\nHe rambled through the customary opening remarks and then, continually\r\nsmoothing his white beard--of which he is excessively proud--approached\r\nthe crux of the matter and the Conclave finally heard the facts it had\r\nassembled to hear. By this time, unfortunately, many of the Conclave\r\nhad departed for home and supper. Yet perhaps it is for the best, for\r\nthose left were the most earnest and intelligent.\r\n\r\n"I would not bore you," he said, "with details of which only the gods\r\nare sure. Know, then, that once granted a few cells of Prelife, it is\r\nan easy matter for the Maternite Machine to add more and more; thus\r\nassuring us, as has always been, a continuous source of Prelife to be\r\nborn by the Generating Machine as children. The machines bear the exact\r\nnumber of children each year to balance the number of us whom the gods\r\nclaim. Such it has always been from time immemorial."\r\n\r\nA murmur of assent and approval of these virtuous words whispered\r\naround the Hall.\r\n\r\n"But now," he continued, however, with less assurance and indeed with\r\neven a stutter here and there, "an unprecedented situation has arisen.\r\nIndeed, I might call it an emergency. For the M-Maternite Machine has\r\nactually failed."\r\n\r\nCries of "Treason" sprang up, and I fear it might have gone hard for\r\nthe priest had I not been able to insure order.\r\n\r\n"That is not the worst," he cried, as if in defiance. "All the Prelife\r\nhas been dried up. It will not function. There is no more. And there\r\nwill be no more children!"\r\n\r\nAt this I feared the Conclave was about to riot. It is at such times\r\nthat I most revere the wisdom of the ancients, who decreed seventy\r\nyears the minimum age for a member of the Conclave. They shouted and\r\nbegan to beat their fists, but for how long can a man of seventy years\r\nroar like a youngster? They quieted, breathing heavily, and I asked,\r\n\r\n"Is there no way, then, to produce more Prelife in order that the\r\nmachines may produce more children for us?\r\n\r\n"As I have said," he replied, "give the machines but a bit of Prelife\r\nand they will produce more. But take away that least bit, and they are\r\nhelpless."\r\n\r\nSuch heresy could have brought a sad end to the priest had not the\r\nConclave been so exhausted by the events of the day. We leaned back to\r\nthink.\r\n\r\nRocsates leaned forward and asked, "Must there not--must there not have\r\nbeen a beginning to Prelife? For the Machine, it seems, cannot make it;\r\nand yet it came from somewhere."\r\n\r\n"Riddles are not called for," I answered severely.\r\n\r\n"Are not riddles often the beginning of knowledge?" he asked, in that\r\nirritating dumber-than-thou attitude of his. "Must there not, long ago,\r\nhave been a source of Prelife: a source now forgotten? And may it not\r\neven now--should we discover it--be available to us? I am reminded of\r\nthe story of the animals of old--"\r\n\r\n"I fear your mind is wandering, Rocsates," I was forced to interrupt.\r\n"I know well the legend of the animals, but what does it have to\r\ndo--" The heads of the Conclave were turning to me, quizzically. I\r\nhastened to explain the legend of the animals. "It is said that many\r\nthousands of years ago, time without reckoning, there existed on the\r\nearth creatures who were alive like us, and yet not like us. It is said\r\nthey had four legs or more, and no arms, were covered with hair, and\r\nalthough not mute, they could not speak."\r\n\r\nRocsates\' voice made itself heard. "It is true. Such creatures did\r\nindeed exist. It is recorded most scientifically in the films."\r\n\r\n"If it be so," I said, quieting the hub-bub that followed, "and I would\r\nnot doubt your word, Rocsates, for all know you are the wisest of\r\nmen--if it were so, then, what of it?"\r\n\r\n"May it not be," Rocsates put in, "that these animals had no machines\r\nto reproduce their kind? For surely the gods would not grant machines\r\nto such creatures. And indeed, if they had Maternite Machines, why then\r\nwe would yet have these animals among us."\r\n\r\n"And how, then, did these animals reproduce?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"How, indeed? And is there not a legend--admitted only a legend--that\r\nsays there was a time before the machines, and before the Maternite\r\nMachine, and that at such a time both the animals and Men reproduced\r\nfrom within their own bodies?"\r\n\r\nAt this two members of the Conclave fell immediately into a faint, and\r\nI would gladly have joined them. I hoped that the youngsters, Xeon\r\nand Melia, had not heard, but as I turned they were listening most\r\nattentively to Rocsates, who, amid cries of "Heresy" and "Treason",\r\nwent on:\r\n\r\n"I should like to ask the Conclave for permission to search the ancient\r\nrecords, in the hope of finding some such knowledge that would prove or\r\ndisprove my words."\r\n\r\n"You wish to search the films--" I began.\r\n\r\n"Not the films, Sias, but the books."\r\n\r\nGods, this Rocsates! The books, as well he knows, are so ancient,\r\nand so delicate, that they are kept in an air-tight tomb; lest,\r\nbeing handled, they be destroyed and all knowledge within them lost.\r\nTherefore, they have not been read in the known history of our race.\r\nAnd Rocsates has been anxious for an excuse--\r\n\r\n"Sias," he went on, "if there exists such knowledge as I seek, is it\r\nnot indeed lost to the memory of Man? And if so, are not the books the\r\nonly place where it may be found?"\r\n\r\nRocsates, it is suspected, will never ask a question unless he knows\r\nthe answer beforehand. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
And so I acquiesced, and agreed, and granted\r\npermission. And with much misgiving and foreboding of evil, the\r\nConclave adjourned.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSeveral weeks elapsed before Rocsates requested that the Conclave meet.\r\nI called the meeting at dawn and so it was yet early in the afternoon\r\nwhen formalities were concluded and Rocsates granted leave to speak.\r\n\r\n"Some of those among you are She\'s," he began. "And you know you are\r\ndifferent from the rest of us. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
To the advantage, your skin is fairer\r\nand your features more often handsomer than ours. To the disadvantage,\r\nyour excretory system is not so mechanically dextrous as ours. And, you\r\nmay say, why should this not be so? There is, indeed, no reason why we\r\nshould all be identical. Perforce you have the advantage, perforce we\r\ndo. Yet there is one other distinction.\r\n\r\n"Some among you She\'s have the swelling of the breasts. And does there\r\nexist no reason for this? Was there not, perhaps in ancient times, a\r\ncause for this? Do you not wonder, She\'s, whence you come and for what\r\nreason?"\r\n\r\n"Rocsates," I interrupted. "All this is fascinating, of course. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
But if\r\nyou could be quick--"\r\n\r\n"Of course," he replied. "In the course of my reading I have read\r\nmany books, and while they are all vague on the subject, this I have\r\ndiscovered:\r\n\r\n"That there was indeed a time before the machines, in fact the books\r\nwere created in that time, for not one of them mentions the machines.\r\nThen reproduction was carried on by individuals, without help of the\r\nthen nonexistent machines. The She\'s are not wanderers from another\r\nland, but they have lived with us for all time; they are not another\r\nrace, but we are all types of one race. And the fact of reproduction is\r\nsomehow intimately related to the physical distinctions of the She\'s!"\r\n\r\nThese last sentences were shouted to be heard above the roar of the\r\ncrowd. Yet when Rocsates stopped, so also did the noise, so shocked and\r\namazed at his words were they. And I confess, myself also.\r\n\r\n"In fact," Rocsates added, sitting down, "this process of reproduction\r\nseems to have been so simple that there was once a problem of\r\nover-population."\r\n\r\nOrder was lost among the Conclave as each man turned to speak to his\r\nneighbor, and for some time I could not restore order. I realized that\r\nsomething had to be done to save Rocsates before the outrage of the\r\nassembled overwhelmed him.\r\n\r\n"It seems," I shouted, "that there is a flaw in your logic." For if\r\nsuch there was, I was hopeful of dismissing the entire affair with\r\nno harm done. "For if people reproduced too often, why then this\r\nreproduction must have been a pleasant thing to do; otherwise they\r\nwould not have done so to excess. And if it was a pleasant thing to do,\r\nwhere is the necessity for the machines, and why were they created?"\r\n\r\nRocsates seemed perplexed by this problem, whereupon Xeon, who together\r\nwith Melia were at the Conclave without permission, shouted, "Perhaps\r\nthe process of reproduction was of _such_ a pleasure that the Conclave\r\nruled it to be a sin? And therefore the machines were necessary!"\r\n\r\nAt this impudence the Conclave dissolved in an uproar, and I was beyond\r\npower to restrain them from placing Xeon under arrest. Privately,\r\nhowever, I had to admit that his supposition was a possibility, and\r\nthus I authorized Rocsates to continue his search.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow indeed I was sorely worried concerning Xeon, for he must languish\r\nin the dungeon until the Conclave is satisfied to release him, and this\r\nthey cannot do until they meet again.\r\n\r\nI needed a sufficient excuse to call a meeting of the Conclave,\r\nwhereupon I might argue for the lad. When I heard that Rocsates again\r\ndesired audience, I immediately proclaimed a meeting of the Conclave\r\nto be held the next day at dawn, and so that night slept well.\r\n\r\nThe Conclave had come to order and formalities had been initiated when\r\nRocsates entered and took his place. He clutched under one shoulder\r\na thin, rectangular object, but that is not what impressed me. His\r\nappearance--he looked as if he had not slept of late, nor eaten either.\r\nHis eyes were sunken, and his features had doubled in age. He was bent\r\nand tired. But it was his eyes. There was a horror in them.\r\n\r\nI was shocked, and could not help staring at him. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
And then the\r\nformalities were over. I intended to speak for Xeon, but Rocsates was\r\non his feet and I gave way.\r\n\r\n"I have indeed discovered the secret of reproduction," he began. "After\r\nmany searchings, I came upon this--" and he held forth the object he\r\nhad carried in. "It is a book. It is entitled, \'Living a Normal Sex\r\nLife.\' It seems to be some sort of a do-it-yourself pamphlet." He\r\ndropped the book on the table and rubbed his hands over his eyes.\r\n\r\nThere was something in the man\'s behavior that commanded everyone\'s\r\nattention. He went on, speaking low. "The word \'Sex\' is not defined,\r\nbut it seems to mean...." His words trailed off. He was obviously\r\nunsure of how to continue. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
"I had better start at the beginning, I\r\nsuppose," he said. "You see, once upon a time there were birds and\r\nbees...."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen he finished the Conclave sat in horrified silence. His words,\r\nwith all their horror, had the ring of truth and there were no cries of\r\n\'Heresy\'. There was only stunned disbelief and the beginnings of nausea.\r\n\r\nIt is the mark of honor that a leader shall carry on when others fear\r\nto move. I cleared my throat.\r\n\r\n"Shall not these organs which you mention have atrophied by now? With\r\nno use throughout all these generations, will they not have evolved\r\ninto nothingness?"\r\n\r\n"I do not think so," Rocsates replied after a while. "What to us is\r\nan eon, to evolution is but an instant. And then the swelling of the\r\nbreasts, I believe, proves that there is still reproductive activity in\r\nsome, at least, of the She\'s."\r\n\r\nWe sat shaking our heads, bowed under terrible reality.\r\n\r\n"Then we must experiment," I said. "But whom could we ask to submit to\r\nsuch horror?"\r\n\r\n"I have already taken the liberty of asking for volunteers," Rocsates\r\nreplied. "The She, of course, must be one with the swelling of the\r\nbreasts. Melia has volunteered, on condition that Xeon be released from\r\ndungeon. Are there any objections?

=== Chunk 10 ===
"\r\n\r\nThere were none, of course. Who would refuse a boon to one who would\r\nundergo such an ordeal for the City?\r\n\r\n"And who will be the partner?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"In all honor, could Xeon allow Melia to surpass him in courage? It\r\nshall be he," Rocsates said. And with his word the two entered the Hall\r\nand stood, noble and naked.\r\n\r\nRocsates gestured to the table, and Melia started to climb upon it,\r\nbut Xeon stepped forward.\r\n\r\n"My lords," he said, "would not better results be obtained were we to\r\nconduct the experiment in the fields before the Oracle of Delni, that\r\nthe gods may help us?"\r\n\r\nHis glance reached into my soul, and I was proud of Xeon. A true\r\nfriend, he thought even now of the comfort of Melia. The marble table\r\nwas indeed hard, and from Rocsates\' description it seemed that Melia\'s\r\nposition would be as uncomfortable as it would be undignified. The soft\r\nfields might be some slight help.\r\n\r\nI voiced my assent, and the entire Conclave adjourned to the fields.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was nearly dark when we walked home, Rocsates and I, arm in arm. It\r\nhad been a horrible day. The inhuman indignity, the cries--\r\n\r\nWe tarried before my home, leaned on the stone, stared at the first\r\nstars.\r\n\r\n"They seemed finally to accomplish all the book described," I muttered.\r\n\r\n"They may indeed have succeeded," Rocsates replied. "There is mentioned\r\na time lapse which is necessary. The child does not appear immediately."\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t matter," I said disconsolately. "Who could ask them to go\r\nthrough such an ordeal again?"\r\n\r\nAnd then I looked down to earth again, and saw them standing before me.\r\nMelia cast her eyes down, and would not raise them. Xeon held his arm\r\nabout her shoulders, as if to protect her, but I know not from whom.\r\n\r\n"Sias," he said. Then stopped, embarrassed.\r\n\r\nI waited, and Rocsates was silent, and he continued.\r\n\r\n"Sias, we come to tell.... We will...." He raised his eyes to mine and\r\nsaid manfully, "We shall try again."\r\n\r\nI am afraid that tears came to my eyes. Such sacrifice--\r\n\r\n"We beg one favor," Xeon went on. "We are agreed that--Well, we should\r\nlike to be left alone, in private, to try."\r\n\r\n"Of course," I replied. Anything they might want they could have. My\r\nrelief and gratitude must have showed, for Xeon took a deep breath and\r\nspoke again.\r\n\r\n"We do not deserve praise, Sias," he said. "The truth is, we ... we\r\nsort of enjoy it."\r\n\r\nI watched them turn and wander off together under the stars.\r\n\r\nMy heart has a warmth in it, and I no longer fear for the future of our\r\nrace when our young people can show such nobility and sacrifice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s The Birds and the Bees, by David E.
