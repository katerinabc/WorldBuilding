It was lying\r\nhalf-buried in the sand, and the wind howled in fury over it, and when\r\nhe bent to pick it up the sun smote him like a shining blade, dividing\r\nhis tall body into blinding light and wavering shadow.\r\n\r\nI knew it was a Martian mirror before he straightened. The\r\ncraftsmanship was breathtaking and could not have been duplicated\r\non Earth. It was shaped like an ordinary hand mirror; but its glass\r\nsurface was like a lake of fire, with depth beyond depth to it, and\r\nthe jewels sparkling at its rim were a deep aquamarine which seemed to\r\ntransmute the sun-glow into shimmering bands of starlight.\r\n\r\nI could have told Steve that such mirrors, by their very nature, were\r\ndestructive. When a man carries a hopeless vision of loveliness about\r\nwith him, when he lives with that vision night and day, he ceases to be\r\nthe undisputed master of his own destiny--\r\n\r\n"She\'s alive, Jim," Steve said. "A woman dead fifty thousand years.\r\nA woman from a civilization that flourished before the dawn of human\r\nhistory."\r\n\r\n"Take it easy, Steve," I warned. "The Martians simply knew how to\r\npreserve every aspect of a mirrored image. Say howdedo to her if you\r\nlike. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
Press your lips to the glass and see what happens. But don\'t\r\nmistake an imitation of life for the real thing."\r\n\r\n"An imitation of life!" Steve flared. "Man, she just smiled at me.\r\nShe\'s aware of us, I tell you."\r\n\r\n"Sure she is. Her brain was mirrored too, every aspect of its\r\nelectro-dynamic structure preserved forever by a science that\'s lost\r\nforever. Get a grip on yourself, Steve.

=== Chunk 3 ===
"\r\n\r\nI was hot and tired and dusty. My throat was parched and I didn\'t feel\r\nmuch like arguing with him. But I had my reasons for being stubborn.\r\n\r\n"Men have found Martian mirrors and gone mad," I said. "Don\'t take any\r\nchances, Steve. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
We don\'t know yet what it\'s rigged with. Why not play\r\nit safe? A thousand cycles of direct current should melt it down."\r\n\r\n"Melt _her_ down!" Steve\'s eyes narrowed in sudden fury. "Why, it would\r\nbe murder!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSteve got up and brushed sand from his knees. He held the mirror up so\r\nthat the red Martian sunlight caught and aureoled the splendor of a\r\nface that offered a man no chance of help if he ever let go.\r\n\r\nA pale, beautiful face, the eyes fringed with long, dark lashes, the\r\nlips parted in a mocking smile. A living image capable of mercurial\r\nchanges of mood, unnaturally still one moment, smiling and animated the\r\nnext.\r\n\r\n_One thing at a time_, I thought. _Don\'t drive him too hard._\r\n\r\n"Some men have carried them about for years," I said. "But just\r\nremember what falling in love with an image can mean. You\'ll never hold\r\nher in your arms, Steve. And compulsions can kill."\r\n\r\n"She\'s alive as flesh-and-blood is alive," he said, glaring at me.\r\n\r\n"Easy, Steve!"\r\n\r\nI could see that I was going to have trouble with my stout-hearted\r\nbuddy, Captain Stephen Claymore.\r\n\r\nHe could have stared at a mountain of gold unmoved. He could have knelt\r\nwith a wry chuckle, and let a handful of diamonds trickle through his\r\nwiry, bronze-knuckled hands, in utter contempt for what diamonds could\r\nbuy on Earth.\r\n\r\nHe could have thrown back his head and laughed, at wealth, at glory,\r\nat anything you want to name that men prize highly on Earth. But a\r\nbeautiful woman was a temptation apart. A beautiful woman--\r\n\r\nSteve grabbed my arm. "Look out, Tom!" he cried. "Watch it!"\r\n\r\nThe bullet whizzed past like a heat-maddened insect. Steve leapt back,\r\nand I flattened myself.\r\n\r\nThe attack was no great surprise. When people take up a new way of\r\nlife, when they pull up stakes and go striding into the sunrise, strife\r\npaces after like a ravenous hound, red tongue lolling. When the first\r\ncolonists from Earth swarmed into the crumbling Martian cities a good\r\nthird of them ended up in stony desolation with their hearts drilled\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nThey danced to riotous tunes, calling for louder music and stronger\r\nwine, and they fought savagely to set up little kingdoms of tyranny\r\neighty feet square.\r\n\r\nEverywhere anarchy reigned, and haggard-eyed, desperate men crouched\r\nbehind smoke-blackened ruins and held off other men as greedy as\r\nthemselves. They fought and died by dozens, by hundreds, their minds\r\ninflamed by the quickly-made discovery that the Martian cities were\r\nvast treasure troves.\r\n\r\nYou had to go prospecting, you had to search, and when you found your\r\nown shining treasure you didn\'t want to share it with any man alive.\r\n\r\nSteve had his gun trained on the wall ahead when he ducked down at my\r\nside.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," I whispered, half to myself. "This is going to be rough!

=== Chunk 5 ===
"\r\n\r\n"They asked for it!" Steve said.\r\n\r\nHis gun roared twice.\r\n\r\nFrom the wall ahead came a burst of gunfire in reply.\r\n\r\n"If they think they\'re going to get this mirror away from me--"\r\n\r\nI looked at his grim, sweat-beaded face. "I\'ll help you fight for it,"\r\nI said.\r\n\r\n"So nice of you," he grunted.\r\n\r\n"Then maybe you\'ll have sense enough to bury it face down in the sand."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGuns went off thirty feet directly in front of us. Red sand geysered\r\nup, granite cracked and splintered. You could feel the awful heat of\r\nthe blazing exchange of bullets.\r\n\r\nI could see faces between the chinks. Malignant faces moving from\r\npeep-hole to peep-hole like scavenger birds hopping about in the desert.\r\n\r\nI was aiming at one of the peep-holes when Steve groaned and sagged\r\nagainst me. His gun arm sagged, and I could see that a bullet had\r\npierced his shoulder high up.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry, Tom," he whispered, hoarsely. "I was careless, damn it!"\r\n\r\n"Never mind, Steve," I said.\r\n\r\n"Now they\'ll close in and get you. Better take my gun. You can use two\r\nguns."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t need two guns, Steve," I said. "I\'m walking into the open with\r\nmy hands raised."\r\n\r\n"You\'re crazy!" he breathed, his eyes on my face. "We\'re outnumbered\r\nfive to one. They\'ll drop you the instant you step out from behind this\r\nwall."\r\n\r\nMy gun was hot and smoking. I smiled and tossed it to the sand.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be back in a minute and fix up that shoulder," I said.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll be walking to your death," he said. "They\'ve been trailing us\r\nfor days, hoping we\'d stumble on something. They must have seen me pick\r\nup that mirror."\r\n\r\n"They trailed us because they thought we looked experienced, rugged,"\r\nI said. "They thought we were following a map. They just haven\'t got\r\nwhat it takes to go prospecting for themselves. They\'re hyenas of the\r\ndesert, Steve."\r\n\r\n"All right--hyenas. That means they won\'t respect a white flag. If you\r\nwalk out with your hands raised they\'ll burn you down before you\'ve\r\ntaken five steps."\r\n\r\nI steadied my helmet and unloosed my collar so that I wouldn\'t feel\r\ncramped.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t worry, Steve," I said.\r\n\r\nI knew they saw me the instant I stepped out from behind the wall.\r\n\r\nThe silence was ominous, and I could feel their eyes upon me, hot and\r\ndeadly.\r\n\r\nI didn\'t raise my hands. It didn\'t seem quite right to let them think I\r\nwas seeking a truce. A man may be a fool to play fair with killers, but\r\nsomething made me change my mind about raising my hands.\r\n\r\nI\'d give them their chance--ten seconds. I wouldn\'t try to bargain for\r\nthose ten seconds by walking toward them under false colors. I\'d just\r\ntrust to luck and--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSteve had never seen the weapon I held in my palm. It was a tiny\r\nelectrostatic accelerator tube, capable of flexible, high precision\r\ncontrol of ions with energies up to twelve million electron-volts.\r\n\r\nIt was a simple thing--and unbelievably destructive. It made no sound\r\nat all. But ten seconds after I clicked it on, the desert directly in\r\nmy path was glowing white hot.\r\n\r\nJust a glow, white, dazzling for an instant. Then a dull rumbling shook\r\nthe ground and the wall opposite blackened and crumbled. The heat was\r\nlike a blast of incandescent helium gas from a man-made sun.\r\n\r\nI turned and walked back to where Steve was lying.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t want to do it that way," I said. "But I had no choice. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
It was\r\nthem--or us."\r\n\r\nSteve seemed not to realize we were no longer in danger. There was fear\r\nin his eyes, and he was staring at me as if I\'d just returned from the\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nIn a way I had. A man may die fifty deaths while counting off ten\r\nseconds in his mind.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll give you something to help you sleep, Steve," I said.\r\n\r\nIt didn\'t take me long to dress and bind up his wound. He winced once\r\nor twice, but he never took his eyes from the mirror.\r\n\r\n"You promised to bury it face down in the sand," I said.\r\n\r\nHe looked at me. "You know better than that," he said. "I promised\r\nnothing of the sort."\r\n\r\n"It\'s like falling in love with a ghost, only worse," I said.\r\n\r\n"That\'s where you\'re wrong. There\'s nothing ghostly about her."\r\n\r\nI mixed him a sleeping draught, using the little water we had left.\r\n\r\nIn five minutes he was snoring. I pried the mirror from his fingers and\r\npropped it up against a rock, so that he could see her face when he\r\nwoke up.\r\n\r\nThen I stretched myself out in the sand, kicked off my shoes and stared\r\nup at the sky. The sun was just sinking to rest, and there was a thin\r\nsprinkling of stars in the middle of the sky.\r\n\r\nThe stars seemed cold and immeasurably remote.\r\n\r\nWould it work out?\r\n\r\nCould it possibly work out? Was I sticking out my neck in a gamble\r\nso big it was like attempting to pierce the sun, and hammer out a\r\nnew humanity on a great blazing anvil heated to millions of degrees\r\ncentigrade?\r\n\r\nI laughed, alone with my thoughts. Nothing dared, nothing gained. What\r\ndoes a man gain by striking bargains with the mouse in himself?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI awoke in the cool dawn. The morning mists had rolled back and the red\r\ndesert looked almost beautiful in the sun-glow.\r\n\r\nSteve was sitting up, staring at the mirror. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
The light shifted\r\nsuddenly, and I could see the radiance which smouldered in the depths\r\nof the glass.\r\n\r\nI got up, walked to the wall and peered over Steve\'s shoulder. The girl\r\nwas looking at him, her face so beautiful it fairly took my breath\r\naway. It was as though after a lifetime of wandering she\'d found the\r\nonly man in the world for her.\r\n\r\nHer face was bright with sympathy, with compassion for Steve. But\r\nSteve sat slumped in utter dejection, his eyes burning holes in his\r\nface. He didn\'t even look up when I spoke to him.\r\n\r\n"She knows, Tom," he whispered, hoarsely. "She turned pale when that\r\nbullet hit me. She was relieved when you dressed the wound. She\'s been\r\nwatching over me all night, like an angel of mercy."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll need her more and more," I said. "You know what the end will\r\nbe, Steve. Complete hopelessness in an empty room."\r\n\r\nHe stood up, his face savage.\r\n\r\n"I never asked your advice," he ground out. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
"I\'m not asking it now."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got to save you, Steve," I said.\r\n\r\n"I love her, do you hear? I don\'t care what happens to me!"\r\n\r\nI picked up the mirror before he could guess my purpose. I swung about\r\nand I brought that rare and beautiful object down on the rock Steve had\r\nbeen sitting on.\r\n\r\nThere was a splintering crash, a crackling burst of white flame.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: There was a splintering crash, a crackling burst of\r\nflame....]\r\n\r\nSteve gave a great despairing cry. He stood for an instant staring down\r\nat the shattered fragments of the mirror. Then he came at me like a\r\ncharging bull, his eyes bloodshot.\r\n\r\nI clipped him lightly on the jaw.\r\n\r\n"That\'s all I wanted to know, Steve," I said. "Thanks, pal."\r\n\r\nI looked down at him, lying in a crumpled heap at my feet.\r\n\r\nI was glad he hadn\'t fallen on his wounded side. He was plenty sturdy,\r\nand he came from a long-lived family, and I didn\'t think a little clip\r\non the jaw could hurt him. I hoped he\'d forgive me when he woke up.\r\nThat was important, because I thought a lot of Steve.\r\n\r\nWhen you\'ve been to Mars, when you\'ve fought your way through the red\r\nand raging dust storms, and labored beneath the naked glare of the\r\nsun, and juggled with men and ships and supplies like some tremendous\r\nHerculean figure in the morning of the world, you\'ll never really feel\r\nat home on Earth. You\'ll see the world of ordinary men and women as a\r\nvision of Lilliput, too small to be measurable in terms of human worth.\r\nYou\'ll be lost and helpless, blind and staggering beneath the weight\r\nof a memory you can\'t throw off. A memory of bigness, too much bigness,\r\nintegrated into your every fiber, as much a part of you as the beating\r\nof your heart.\r\n\r\nYou\'ll lurch and over-reach yourself, you\'ll never feel at home on\r\nEarth, never really at home. You\'ll find a way to come back to Mars.\r\n\r\nI smiled down at Steve.\r\n\r\nSo Steve had come back to go prospecting, like an ordinary greed-driven\r\nman, and only I knew he was one of the scant dozen great constructive\r\ngeniuses who had made possible man\'s conquest of space.\r\n\r\nHe was an engineer, a physicist and--a man in need of a partner. So\r\nI\'d just stepped up and introduced myself. Tom Gierson, who knew every\r\nsquare foot of Mars. For my purpose one Earth name was as good as\r\nanother, and Tom Gierson had a sturdy ring.\r\n\r\nHard-bitten Tom Gierson, bronzed by the harsh Martian sunlight, as much\r\nat home in the desert as the sturdy little spiked plants that thrust\r\ntheir way up through the parched soil when the spring begins to break.\r\n\r\nSteve\'s finest achievement was years in the past, but he was a young\r\nman still, with a young man\'s need of a woman as great as himself to\r\nshare every moment of his waking life. That woman was waiting for him,\r\nbut I had to be sure that he\'d really go berserk if I smashed the glass.\r\n\r\nI was sure now.\r\n\r\nI raised my arm, and out of the ruins the Martians came.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSteady hands lifted Steve up, and a hushed silence ringed Steve round.\r\n\r\n"Azala," I said. "Where is she--"\r\n\r\nThen I saw her. She was advancing straight toward me through the glare\r\nof sunset on desert sand, a shining eagerness in her eyes. The girl of\r\nthe mirror, young and straight and alive, her hair the color of red\r\nsand and sunset glow, her eyes twin dark stars.\r\n\r\nShe paused before me and raised her eyes in questioning wonder.\r\n\r\n"Go to him," I said. "He will never love another woman. I can promise\r\nyou that."\r\n\r\nShe ran to Steve with a little glad cry and fell to her knees beside\r\nhim. I wanted to break through the circle and slap Steve on the back,\r\nand wish him all the happiness on Mars. The first Earthian to wed a\r\nMartian, and it was tremendous, and I wanted to tell Steve--\r\n\r\nBut how could I tell him that Martians had numerous ways of watching\r\nEarthians, the very best being mirrors which were really two-way\r\ntelevisual instruments. How could I tell him that the alert Martian\r\nwomen had all been trained to watch and observe Earthians day and\r\nnight? And all the while the Earthians thought they were carrying about\r\nwith them, in beautiful jeweled artifacts of a dead culture, the living\r\nimages of their heart\'s desire!\r\n\r\nSteve was awake now and sitting up straight, and the image was warm and\r\nalive in his arms. But how could I make Steve understand? I had a wild\r\nimpulse to say: "I\'d change places with you if I could, Steve. She\'s\r\njust about the cutest kid I know."\r\n\r\nYou get to thinking that way when you\'ve mingled with Earthians around\r\ndesert campfires, studying them as you\'d study a new neighbor who comes\r\nknocking at your door, the neighbor you fear at first and are never\r\nquite sure of until you really get to know and like him.\r\n\r\nYou see, we had so much to offer one another. A young race,\r\nconstructive, brawling, shouting its defiance to the stars. And an old\r\nrace, imaginative, sensitive, heirs to a civilization on the wane, but\r\nneeding just a few Steves to make it young and great again.\r\n\r\nI\'d picked Steve because he was one of the shining ones of Earth. I\'d\r\nknown from the start that persuading him to wed a Martian woman would\r\ntake plenty of doing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEarthians are funny that way. Love to them is a complex thing, a web\r\nthat has to be skillfully woven right from the start. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
Beauty alone\r\nisn\'t enough. You have to say to them: "You\'ll never hold that woman in\r\nyour arms. Can\'t you see how hopeless it is?

=== Chunk 10 ===
"\r\n\r\nThen the iron goes deep. If a love flies straight in the teeth of\r\ndespair and comes out all right in the end, it will be as strong as\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nSo I\'d arranged for Steve to stumble on the mirror, to pick up that\r\ntwo-way televisual circuit into a very special paradise for two. And\r\nI\'d opposed and warned him just to make sure he\'d think of himself as a\r\nman facing hopeless odds to win through to an undying love.\r\n\r\nOn the other side it was easier. Azala had fallen in love with Steve\r\nbefore we put her on the other end of that televisual circuit. But\r\nseeing him wounded and in need of her had turned it into what Earthians\r\ncall a great love.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Earthians would someday smash the aura that had flamed about\r\nthe heads of the Martian rulers for fifty thousand years.\r\n\r\nI\'d done my best to smash it. I had gone simply and humbly among\r\nEarthians, seeking a fresh wind to trundle the cinders of a dying\r\nculture.\r\n\r\nI dreamed of Martians and Earthians standing equal and strong and\r\nproud, hands linked in friendship, cemented by bonds of kinship,\r\nseparated by no gulfs such as now yawned before me, separating me from\r\nSteve.\r\n\r\nI wanted to shout: "Good luck, Steve, Azala. You\'re good kids and you\r\ndeserve the best."\r\n\r\nThen I remembered that Steve was nearly forty, not quite a kid by\r\nEarthian standards. But, looking at Azala, I was pretty sure that Steve\r\nstill had his best years ahead of him.\r\n\r\nI wanted to go up to him and shake his hand for the last time. But now\r\nthe hands of my people were tugging at my shoulders, stripping off the\r\nEarthian garments I\'d worn so long with scant respect for my desire to\r\nbe as human and regular as the next guy.\r\n\r\nThey got the suit off, and then I saw the old familiar cloak, purple\r\nand billowing out with shimmering star images, and I shuddered a little\r\nbecause I knew I\'d never really feel at ease wearing it from that\r\nmoment on.\r\n\r\nThey got me into the cloak and they bent down and straightened the\r\nstiff imperial folds and I was suddenly bored and deathly weary.\r\n\r\nA chill wind from the stars seemed to blow over me, but I stood\r\nstraight and still, and allowed them to fasten on the cloak the great\r\nglowing jewel I\'d worn from childhood.\r\n\r\nSteve saw me then. He was sitting up very straight, his hand on Azala\'s\r\ntumbled, red-gold hair, and I heard him say: "Holy smoke."\r\n\r\nI stared down at the jewel, blazing and shuddering and shivering in\r\nthe desert air, and I shut my eyes tight, wishing for the first time\r\nin my life that it did not proclaim me Tulan Sharm, the Glorious One,\r\nTemporal Ruler of the Seven Cities before Whom the Stars Bowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
