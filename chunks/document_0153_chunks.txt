Fellow IRE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Jan. 25._\r\n\r\nLast night, in my dreams, I was a monstrous ant, and had been digging\r\nmyself a burrow in the soft fresh earth. The dream was intensely real,\r\nand when I awoke, I felt as tired as if I had actually been digging. My\r\narms ached, and I was astonished, upon examining my hands, to find them\r\nraw.\r\n\r\nDressing hastily, I rushed to the back yard, and there, sure enough,\r\nnear the fence, was a large hole about two feet deep and three feet\r\nlong. Hurriedly, I filled it in and returned to the house.\r\n\r\nI must rest for a few days, as I feel that the intense excitement caused\r\nby my investigations, is preying too heavily upon my mind.\r\n\r\nAt this time, I feel that I should make a brief summary of my findings\r\nin respect to the ants, so that Barclay may go over these notes upon his\r\nreturn from his vacation.\r\n\r\n_First:_ The ant colony is the source of a powerful bell-like tone which\r\nis radiated continuously on two wave-lengths, .0018 meter, and .00176\r\nmeter. This tone acts as a radio-beacon, and directs the ants to the\r\ncolony, no matter where they may be located. The .0018 meter wave is\r\nused by the ants for their "clacking" conversations, by means of which\r\nthey communicate with each other and the colony, receiving orders from\r\nthe directing intelligence, reporting the location of food, and\r\nrequesting help, when needed.\r\n\r\nThe wave .00176 meter, is used for sending thought images or pictures\r\nwhich may be sent with the "clacking" code, or independently. I cannot\r\nconceive a more efficient or highly specialized communications system.

I\r\n_must_ learn their secret, their methods.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Jan. 30._\r\n\r\nThis morning, while sitting at the receiver in a semi-doze, with the\r\nbell-tone ringing in my ears, I fell into that state known as\r\n"day-dreaming." Little "Nippy," my beloved fox terrier, and constant\r\ncompanion, rushed into the laboratory and ran up to me.\r\n\r\nFor a moment my mind went blank. My hands shot out. I grasped the dog\r\naround the throat and began to throttle him. I had risen from my chair,\r\nand the dog was nearly dead, when I slipped and fell, pulling the phone\r\nplug out of the receiver.\r\n\r\nInstantly, my mind cleared, and words cannot express the remorse I felt\r\nat my inhuman actions. Nippy would have nothing to do with me, and\r\ncrawled dejectedly from the room, a terrified look in his eyes.\r\n\r\nI have no explanation for my actions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Feb. 3._\r\n\r\nThe transmitter is ready for operation. I have constructed a pair of\r\nmetal disc-electrodes which clamp tightly to my head and press upon my\r\ntemples. This device will pick up the thought impulses from my brain,\r\nfeed them directly into the radio-frequency amplifier, where they will\r\nbe amplified, and then radiated in a tight directed beam.\r\n\r\nMy two ants were in their little enclosure under the microscope when I\r\nthrew the switch to the "send" position. I pictured myself as I looked\r\nas a man, and sent the thought, "I am a man."\r\n\r\nHastily, I threw the switch to the "receive" position. I looked through\r\nthe microscope.\r\n\r\nThe ants were lying on their sides. Somehow, I felt that the power was\r\ntoo great, and had stunned them. Keeping my eye to the microscope, I\r\nagain threw the switch to "send," and cut the power to half.\r\n\r\n"Get up, friends ... get up," I thought, as I pictured them rising. Sure\r\nenough ... the ants slowly regained their feet. They looked about in\r\napparent bewilderment. Back again, in "receive" position, I was\r\nconscious of the thought image,\r\n\r\n"The man ... he is the man. The man holds us here. He is killing us. We\r\nmust kill the man."\r\n\r\nThey gnashed their fierce-looking mandibles. I snapped back to "send"\r\nand thought.\r\n\r\n"No ... you must not kill the man. The man will not harm you ... he is\r\nyour friend. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
He will help you."\r\n\r\nAs I watched, the ants seemed to become less excited. From the larger of\r\nthe two, I received the thought,\r\n\r\n"We are dying. The man is killing us with his strong vibrations. We\r\nmust kill the man."\r\n\r\nThen a very powerful thought impression burst upon my brain.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to come from the colony, three feet away.\r\n\r\n"Warning to the man. Stop your thought transmissions at once! Your\r\nvibrations are killing us. We want nothing from you. We have everything\r\nwe need. You will learn nothing from us. You will stop _at once_!"\r\n\r\nI threw the switch to "send." Viewed through the microscope, the two\r\nants were lying on their backs ... dead, to all appearances.\r\n\r\n"What if I don\'t stop?" I sent the thought question, "I want to learn\r\nthe secret of your communication. In return, I will teach you many\r\nthings. I can\'t stop now!"\r\n\r\nI changed to receive, and the answer came back,\r\n\r\n"If you do not stop ... we will kill you!"\r\n\r\nI turned off the apparatus, but the powerful bell tone continued to\r\npound incessantly into my brain.\r\n\r\nI laughed. They\'d kill me ... would they? Those tiny insects ... what\r\ncould they do? Well--let them try, but I\'d get what I was after. I would\r\nnot quit now, with success so near. What if my transmissions did kill a\r\nfew of them? Of what importance were the lives of a few ants as compared\r\nto the advancement of the science of Communication?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Feb. 9._\r\n\r\nI found myself digging again in the back yard yesterday. As before, I\r\nhad been "day-dreaming," when an overwhelming desire to go outside and\r\nfeel the cool moist earth between my fingers and on my face took\r\npossession of me.\r\n\r\nI rushed out into the back yard, and began digging feverishly ... madly,\r\nuntil finally I fell, exhausted. Then my mind cleared and I filled in\r\nthe hole.\r\n\r\nAbout half the ants have died, due no doubt to the strength of my\r\nradiations. No matter how low I cut the power, they still cannot live\r\nbut a short time under the force of my transmissions. They have stopped\r\nsending thought impressions entirely, and are using only their\r\n"clacking" code signals, which they seem to realize I cannot understand.\r\n\r\nI feel that they are undertaking some sort of campaign against me. For\r\nhours they congregate, closely packed, their antennae stiffly pointed\r\nstraight up. Their thought currents seem to be flowing into and merging\r\nwith the bell tone, which grows stronger and more penetrating day by\r\nday.\r\n\r\nIn my back yard, there are four large ant hills, and at each hill,\r\ncuriously, there is no activity except the same mass concentration of\r\nthe ants. Have they, too, been affected by my radiations and joined\r\nforces with the original colony against myself?\r\n\r\nThe bell tone continues to grow stronger.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Feb. 11_\r\n\r\nMrs. Winslow, the middle-aged widow, who comes to clean my house and\r\nlaboratory twice a week, was here this morning.\r\n\r\nShe is short, dumpy, and inclined to be stout. As she went about her\r\nwork, I noticed particularly the fat firm flesh of her neck, just below\r\nthe jaw. I felt an uncontrollable desire to sink my teeth deep into that\r\nflesh, and enjoy the taste of the warm fresh blood.\r\n\r\nI had actually risen from my chair to accomplish my desire, when the\r\ntelephone rang ... and my mind cleared.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Feb. 14._\r\n\r\nI have decided to stop my experiments with the ants.\r\n\r\nAs they refuse to send any more thought impressions, there is nothing\r\nfurther I can learn from them. Somehow, I feel that they are gaining a\r\nhold upon my mind, and that every time I listen in on the receiver, that\r\nhold becomes stronger. I firmly believe that I would have attacked poor\r\nMrs. Winslow, had not the ringing of the \'phone so opportunely\r\ninterrupted me. I have sent word for her to stay away ... as I cannot\r\ntrust myself.\r\n\r\nI keep a box of fresh earth on the table in my laboratory. I often run\r\nmy hands through it, and taste it.

It is remarkable how much this\r\nsoothes my nerves.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Feb. 16._\r\n\r\nIt is too late!\r\n\r\nFor two days, I have kept my apparatus shut off. I have not so much as\r\nlooked at the ants, but still that confounded bell tone rings in my ears\r\nwith all the insistence of African tom-toms. Hour by hour ... the tone\r\nbecomes more penetrating. I cannot sleep, and can eat but little.\r\n\r\nAs a last resort, I destroyed my ant colony. I even went so far as to\r\npour boiling water on the four ant hills in my yard.\r\n\r\nStill ... the bell tone persists. I can stand it no longer!\r\n\r\nPerhaps if I were to dig ... again in the yard ... in the soothing\r\nearth, I could forget....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(News Clipping: From Philadelphia Banner)\r\n\r\nRADIO COMMUNICATIONS ENGINEER DEAD\r\n\r\nHoward E. Edwards, Suicide\r\n\r\n_Philadelphia, Feb. 18._ The body of Howard E. Edwards, B.S., PhD.,\r\nMember I. R. E., eminent authority on Radio Communications, aged 56, was\r\nfound this morning in the back yard of his residence, 1427 Raines\r\nAvenue. The body was almost completely buried in a long narrow hole in\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nAt first, foul-play was suspected, but later it appeared that Edwards\r\nhad dug himself into the ground and died of suffocation, as his nostrils\r\nand mouth were filled with dirt.\r\n\r\nDr. P. A. Hofner, who examined the body, found no wounds, stated that\r\nEdwards had been dead for about two days, and pronounced the death as a\r\nclear case of suicide, the strange means employed probably due to an\r\nunbalanced mental condition.\r\n\r\nElaborate radio apparatus upon which Edwards had been working had been\r\nsmashed to bits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\nThis etext was produced from _Comet_ July 1941.
