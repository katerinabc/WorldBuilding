Beside\r\nit, the bright pastel buildings of Rest Stop 25 stood among the green\r\ntrees. Occasionally a car shot past, a flash of metal and a hiss of\r\nsplit wind; but the road was one which was used more often at night,\r\nand was nearly empty in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nSam was the only attendant on duty. Stop 25 needed only two human\r\nattendants, even at its busiest hours. He sat, staring out at the\r\nhighway, his elbows on the lunch counter, his round face blank, but\r\nhis mouth set tightly. The phone at his elbow emitted a small grunting\r\nnoise.\r\n\r\n"You still there?" the phone voice said inquiringly.\r\n\r\n"Yeah." Sam said, still staring at the highway.\r\n\r\n"Well...." The voice paused. "Look, it might not come your way. It\r\nusually turns west at the New Britain intersection."\r\n\r\n"Not always." Sam said. "It went by here once before."\r\n\r\n"It almost never stops, anyway," the voice said firmly. "It won\'t stop."\r\n\r\n"Some times it does," Sam said.\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t have to."\r\n\r\nSam shrugged and said nothing.\r\n\r\n"Okay, then," the voice said. "I called you about it, anyway."\r\n\r\n"Thanks."\r\n\r\nSam turned away, still watching the road.\r\n\r\nFar off a speck of metal gleamed, growing larger. The distant high\r\nsound of brakes began, as a car decelerated, coming toward the Stop.\r\n\r\nIt was just an ordinary car, Sam told himself. That other car was\r\nstill hundreds of miles away. But his hands were damp as he watched it\r\ngrow larger.\r\n\r\nIt was an ordinary Talman sedan, with two people in it. It swung into\r\nthe Stop\'s parking area, and its doors slid open smoothly. A small red\r\nlight flashed on its arched front. The repair signal. In response the\r\ndoors of the Repair shop opened. The Talman waited, as a man and a\r\nwoman emerged from its padded interior and moved slowly into the Repair\r\nshop. The doors closed behind it.\r\n\r\nThe couple came toward the restaurant, where Sam stood waiting.\r\n\r\n"Hi," the man said to Sam.\r\n\r\n"Afternoon." Sam moved to the counter.

"Something to eat while you\'re\r\nwaiting, folks?"\r\n\r\nThe tall, dark girl glanced out at the closed doors of the Repair shop.\r\n\r\n"How long\'s that car going to take?" she asked in a tired voice. "I\r\nwanted to get home tonight."\r\n\r\n"Not long," Sam said. "It didn\'t look like anything complicated."\r\n\r\n"How can you tell?" the man asked, sitting down. "It could take all\r\nnight."\r\n\r\n"Like something to eat while you\'re waiting?" Sam asked.\r\n\r\nThe woman stared at the lunch racks critically.\r\n\r\n"I never like these places to eat in," the woman said, curling her lip.\r\n"You never know how long the food\'s been stored in the robot."\r\n\r\n"Oh, hell, Grace," the man said wearily. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
To Sam he gave an apologetic\r\nshrug. "Just coffee."\r\n\r\n"Well, you don\'t know," the woman insisted. "I mean...." She watched\r\nSam drawing the coffee into a cup. "I used to cook a lot, by hand, till\r\nJack had the autokitchen put in. He never had any stomach trouble till\r\nthen. It\'s getting so everything\'s ... oh, I don\'t know. It\'s all out\r\nof reach. You don\'t know what\'s happening any more. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Like the car."\r\n\r\n"I wish I knew what she\'s talking about half the time," Jack said,\r\nblowing on his coffee. Sam leaned on the counter, looking past the\r\ncouple toward the empty road.\r\n\r\n"I know what the lady means," Sam said, almost to himself. "You get\r\nto thinking ... well, I can remember when people used to drive their\r\nown cars. Themselves. Steering and everything, except on the biggest\r\nhighways. And everything got done with people. People made things, and\r\ncooked food, and grew plants. Everybody was busy all the time. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
It was\r\nbetter then."\r\n\r\nThe man called Jack shrugged. "Sure, sure. Everybody always talks about\r\nthe good old days. But I don\'t see many of \'em going to live in the\r\nwoods. Like Grace--she says she doesn\'t like the autokitchen, but she\r\nuses it."\r\n\r\n"It saves time," Grace said. "I guess I will have coffee, too, mister."\r\n\r\n"It saves time, she says," Jack said. "For what? She\'s got too much\r\ntime now."\r\n\r\n"I wonder what it must have been like in the old days, here," Grace\r\nsaid vaguely, staring around the lunchroom. "Everybody running in and\r\nout. All the drivers--trucks, with men in them, the way you read about\r\nit in the historical novels. Men that drove their own cars, in all\r\nkinds of weather ... gee."\r\n\r\n"Just like on TV," Sam said, grinning.\r\n\r\n"I hope we get the car out of there pretty soon," Jack said anxiously.\r\nHe glanced out toward the silent garage. "I always wonder what would\r\nhappen if the machinery stuck, or something. How would you ever get\r\nyour car out?"\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t get stuck," Sam said. A peculiar look crossed his face as\r\nhe added, "Not any more."\r\n\r\n"Did it ever?"\r\n\r\nSam shrugged. "Oh, well, you know twenty or thirty years ago all this\r\nautomatic stuff wasn\'t quite so good as it is now. Cars, repair\r\nshops ... things went wrong, sometimes. Like ... like the Traveler."\r\n\r\n"The Traveler?" The woman looked up. "Oh, that\'s just a ghost story.\r\nLike the Flying Dutchman. Isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\nThe lunchroom was completely silent. Sam was no longer paying any\r\nattention to the couple sitting at the counter. He was close to the\r\nbig window, standing stiffly, feet apart, like an admiral on a ship\'s\r\nbridge, his eyes studying the empty horizon. There, where the lines\r\nof the road met with the precision of a drawing-board exercise in\r\nperspective, he thought he saw a fleck of light.\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t when it goes past," Sam said, in a quiet tight voice. He\r\ntalked at the window, his back to the other two, his words meant\r\nmostly for himself.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not its going by. That doesn\'t bother me," he repeated. "It came\r\nby my old place five or six times, I remember. That\'s why I finally\r\nasked to be transferred out here, where it hardly ever goes by. But I\r\ncould have gotten used to it. I mean, you don\'t have to look at it, or\r\nanything. It\'s just another car. Old, sure, but there\'s no difference.\r\nA car goes by, that\'s all. Only...."\r\n\r\n"You mean it\'s real?" the woman asked, in a low voice.\r\n\r\nHer husband\'s eyes were looking out, toward the empty road, following\r\nSam\'s look.\r\n\r\n"The Traveler," he said, without looking at his wife. "Sure, it\'s real.\r\nWhy\'d you think they don\'t make that model of car any more? It\'s real.\r\nI knew somebody who saw it, once."\r\n\r\n"There might even be two or three Travelers," Sam said, watching the\r\ndistant glitter of light. There was certainly a car coming. Just a\r\ncar ... although it was still too far away to tell for sure.\r\n\r\n"A haunted car!" the woman said, her eyes wider. "Gee!"\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t a haunted car," her husband said. "It\'s just one of the\r\nearliest makes of automatic highway cars. Everything automatic,\r\nsteering, destination set ... just like any car is, nowadays. Only it\r\nwasn\'t quite perfect, somehow."\r\n\r\n"They got into their car," Sam said, his eyes picking out distant,\r\nmicroscopic details. The high flaring fins, the double headlamps ...\r\nlit up, although it was broad daylight on the road. He knew what the\r\nrest would be. It was moving so slowly. But it always moved slowly,\r\nbarely thirty miles an hour. As if somebody wanted you to look and\r\nsee....\r\n\r\n"They just got in, the way anybody would do," Sam said. "They set a\r\ndestination, and the windows closed up, and the airconditioner went on,\r\nand the car went out on the road."\r\n\r\n"Only it never got there," the other man said. "Wherever it was going\r\nto go."\r\n\r\n"But ..." the woman looked puzzled. "Wouldn\'t anybody stop it? I mean,\r\nwouldn\'t it run out of fuel, or ... well, how did the people in it get\r\nout?"\r\n\r\n"It does just what any car does," her husband told her. "It gets fuel\r\nwhen it needs it. You can\'t just stop a robot control device. Not till\r\nit\'s good and ready.

=== Chunk 6 ===
"\r\n\r\n"But the people in it," she said. "They\'d starve, or something...."\r\n\r\nThe car called the Traveler, rolling at the stately thirty miles an\r\nhour it always held, was coming down the road now, and the two men\r\nstood, watching. The woman, a little behind them, watched too, her face\r\ngrowing whiter. No one said anything as the old fashioned car rolled\r\nby, straight and steady down the highway, holding the center of the\r\nlane as sharply as it always did.\r\n\r\nThere was a film of dust inside the windows, though the Traveler was\r\nclean and shining outside. But the film did hide the white bone faces,\r\nthe despairing hands that had long ago stopped trying to break through\r\nthose closed windows.\r\n\r\n"They never did get out," the man named Jack said, as the Traveler\r\nrolled on, growing smaller along the endless road.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mind it when it goes past," Sam said, his voice thinner edged.\r\n"I really don\'t. It\'s just a car. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Things like that used to happen. I\r\nmean, it\'s a car. Even when it stops to get gas, I don\'t have to pay\r\nany attention."\r\n\r\nHe looked at the couple, his mouth loose. "As long as it just goes on.\r\nThat\'s all right. But I keep thinking some day it\'ll stop. And the door\r\nwill open. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
And maybe ... maybe they\'ll want lunch."\r\n\r\nHe giggled uncontrollably, and then choked it back.\r\n\r\nOutside, the big hangar doors of the repair shop opened. The car that\r\nhad been inside appeared; it moved out and stopped, its doors open\r\ninvitingly.\r\n\r\n"Your car\'s ready now," Sam told the couple. "So long, folks. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
Have a\r\nnice trip."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
