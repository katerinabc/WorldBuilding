He\r\ncontinued, however, to slump loosely against the curving, pearly plastic\r\nof the wall, and took care not to glance toward the translucent ovals he\r\nknew to be observation panels.\r\n\r\nHe was a large man, but thin and bony-faced. His dirty gray coverall\r\nbore the name "Barnsley" upon grimy white tape over the heart. Except at\r\nthe shoulders, it looked too big for him. His hair was dark brown, but\r\nthe sandy ginger of his two-week beard seemed a better match for his\r\nblue eyes.\r\n\r\nFinally, he satisfied the softly insistent gong by standing up and\r\ngazing in turn at each of the three doors spaced around the cylindrical\r\nchamber. He deliberately adopted an expression of simple-minded\r\nanticipation as he ambled over to the nearest one.\r\n\r\nThe door was round, about four feet in diameter, and set in a flattened\r\npart of the wall with its lower edge tangent with the floor. Rods about\r\ntwo inches thick projected a hand\'s breadth at four, eight, and twelve\r\no\'clock. The markings around them suggested that each could be rotated\r\nto three different positions. Barnsley squatted on his heels to study\r\nthese.\r\n\r\nNoting that all the rods were set at the position he had learned to\r\nthink of as "one," he reached out to touch the door. It felt slightly\r\nwarm, so he allowed his fingertips to slide over the upper handle. A\r\ntentative tug produced no movement of the door.\r\n\r\n"That\'s it, though," he mumbled quietly. "Well, now to do our little act\r\nwith the others!"\r\n\r\nHe moved to the second door, where all the rods were set at "two." Here\r\nhe fell to manipulating the rod handles, pausing now and then to shove\r\nhopefully against the door. Some twenty minutes later, he tried the same\r\nroutine at the third door.\r\n\r\nEventually, he returned to his starting point and rotated the rods there\r\nat random for a few minutes. Having, apparently by accident, arranged\r\nthem in a sequence of one-two-three, he contrived to lean against the\r\ndoor at the crucial instant. As it gave beneath his weight, he grabbed\r\nthe two lower handles and pushed until the door rose to a horizontal\r\nposition level with its hinged top. It settled there with a loud click.\r\n\r\n                 *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBarnsley stooped to crawl through into an arched passage of the same\r\npearly plastic. He straightened up and walked along for about twenty\r\nfeet, flashing a white-toothed grin through his beard while muttering\r\ncurses behind it. Presently, he arrived at a small, round bay, to be\r\nconfronted by three more doors.\r\n\r\n"Bet there\'s a dozen of you three-eyed clods peeping at me," he growled.\r\n"How\'d you like me to poke a boot through the panel in front of you and\r\nkick you blubber-balls in all directions? Do you have a page in your\r\ndata books for that?

=== Chunk 2 ===
"\r\n\r\nHe forced himself to _feel_ sufficiently dull-witted to waste ten\r\nminutes opening one of the doors. The walls of the succeeding passage\r\nwere greenish, and the tunnel curved gently downward to the left.\r\nBesides being somewhat warmer, the air exuded a faint blend of heated\r\nmachine oil and something like ripe fish. The next time Barnsley came to\r\na set of doors, he found also a black plastic cube about two feet high.\r\nHe squatted on his heels to examine it.\r\n\r\n_I\'d better look inside or they\'ll be disappointed_, he told himself.\r\n\r\nFrom the corner of his eye, he watched the movement of shadows behind\r\nthe translucent panels in the walls. He could picture the observers\r\nthere: blubbery bipeds with three-jointed arms and legs ending in\r\nclusters of stubby but flexible tentacles. Their broad, spine-crested\r\nheads would be thrust forward and each would have two of his three\r\nprotruding eyes directed at Barnsley\'s slightest move. They had probably\r\nbeen staring at him in relays every second since picking up his scout\r\nship in the neighboring star system.\r\n\r\nThat is, Barnsley thought, it must have been the next system whose\r\nfourth planet he had been photo-mapping for the Terran Colonial Service.\r\nHe hoped he had not been wrong about that.\r\n\r\n_Doesn\'t matter_, he consoled himself, _as long as the Service can trace\r\nme. These slobs certainly aren\'t friendly._\r\n\r\nHe reconsidered the scanty evidence of previous contact in this volume\r\nof space, light-years from Terra\'s nearest colony. Two exploratory ships\r\nhad disappeared. There had been a garbled, fragmentary message picked up\r\nby the recorders of the colony\'s satellite beacon, which some experts\r\ninterpreted as a hasty warning. As far as he knew, Barnsley was the only\r\nTerran to reach this planet alive.\r\n\r\nTo judge from his peculiar imprisonment, his captors had recovered from\r\ntheir initial dismay at encountering another intelligent race--at least\r\nto the extent of desiring a specimen for study. In Barnsley\'s opinion,\r\nthat put him more or less ahead of the game.\r\n\r\n"They\'re gonna learn a lot!" he muttered, grinning vindictively.\r\n\r\nHe finished worrying the cover off the black box. Inside was a plastic\r\nsphere of water and several varieties of food his captors probably\r\nconsidered edible. The latter ranged from a leafy stalk bearing a number\r\nof small pods to a crumbling mass resembling moldy cheese. Barnsley\r\nhesitated.\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t had the guts to try this one yet," he reminded himself,\r\npicking out what looked like a cluster of long, white roots.\r\n\r\nThe roots squirmed feebly in his grasp. Barnsley returned them to the\r\nbox instantly.\r\n\r\nHaving selected, instead, a fruit that could have been a purple\r\ncucumber, he put it with the water container into a pocket of his\r\ncoverall and closed the box.\r\n\r\n_Maybe they won\'t remember that I took the same thing once before_, he\r\nthought. _Oh, hell, of course they will! But why be too consistent?_\r\n\r\nHe opened one of the doors and walked along a bluish passage that\r\ntwisted to the left, chewing on the purple fruit as he went. It was\r\ntougher than it looked and nearly tasteless. At the next junction, he\r\nunscrewed the cap of the water sphere, drained it slowly, and flipped\r\nthe empty container at one of the oval panels. A dim shadow blurred out\r\nof sight, as if someone had stepped hastily backward.\r\n\r\n"Why not?" growled Barnsley. "It\'s time they were shaken up a little!"\r\n\r\n                 *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPretending to have seen something where the container had struck the\r\nwall, he ran over and began to feel along the edge of the panel. When\r\nhis fingertips encountered only the slightest of seams, he doubled his\r\nfists and pounded. He thought he could detect a faint scurrying on the\r\nother side of the wall.\r\n\r\nBarnsley laughed aloud. He raised one foot almost waist-high and drove\r\nthe heel of his boot through the translucent observation panel. Seizing\r\nthe splintered edges of the hole, he tugged and heaved until he had torn\r\nout enough of the thin wall to step through to the other side. He found\r\nhimself entering a room not much larger than the passage behind him.\r\n\r\nTo his left, there was a flicker of blue from a crack in the wall. The\r\ncrack widened momentarily, emitting a gabble of mushy voices. The blue\r\ncloth was twitched away by a cluster of stubby tentacles, whereupon the\r\ncrack closed to an almost imperceptible line. Barnsley fingered his\r\nbeard to hide a grin and turned the other way.\r\n\r\nHe stumbled into a number of low stools surmounted by spongy, spherical\r\ncushions. One of these he tore off for a pillow before going on. At the\r\nend of the little room, he sought for another crack, kicked the panel\r\na bit to loosen it, and succeeded in sliding back a section of wall.\r\nThe passage revealed was about the size of those he had been forced\r\nto explore during the past two weeks, but it had an unfinished,\r\nbehind-the-scenes crudeness in appearance. Barnsley pottered along\r\nfor about fifteen minutes, during which time the walls resounded with\r\ndistant running and he encountered several obviously improvised\r\nbarriers.\r\n\r\nHe kicked his way through one, squeezed through an opening that had not\r\nbeen closed quite in time, restrained a wicked impulse to cross some\r\nwiring that must have been electrical, and at last allowed himself to be\r\ndiverted into a passage leading back to his original cell. He amused\r\nhimself by trying to picture the disruption he had caused to the\r\nhoneycomb of passageways.\r\n\r\n"There!" he grinned to himself. "That should keep them from bothering me\r\nfor a few hours. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Maybe one or two of them will get in trouble over it--I\r\nhope!"\r\n\r\nHe arranged his stolen cushion where the wall met the floor and lay\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nA thought struck him. He sat up to examine the cushion suspiciously.\r\nIt appeared to be an equivalent to foam rubber. He prodded and twisted\r\nuntil convinced that no wires or other unexpected objects were concealed\r\ninside. Not till then did he resume his relaxed position.\r\n\r\nPresently one of his hands located and pinched a tiny switch buried\r\nin the lobe of his left ear. Barnsley concentrated upon keeping his\r\nfeatures blank as a rushing sound seemed to grow in his ear. He yawned\r\ncasually, moving one hand from behind his head to cover his mouth.\r\n\r\nHaving practiced many times before a mirror, he did not think that any\r\npossible watcher would have noticed how his thumb slipped briefly inside\r\nhis mouth to give one eyetooth a slight twist.\r\n\r\nA strong humming inundated his hearing. It continued for perhaps two\r\nminutes, paused, and began again. Barnsley waited through two repetitions\r\nbefore he "yawned" again and sleepily rolled over to hide his face in his\r\nfolded arms.\r\n\r\n"Did you get it all?" he murmured.\r\n\r\n"Clear as a bell," replied a tiny voice in his left ear. "Was that your\r\nwhole day\'s recording?"\r\n\r\n"I guess so," said Barnsley. "To tell the truth, I lose track a bit\r\nafter two weeks without a watch. Who\'s this? 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Sanchez?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s right. You seem to come in on my watch pretty nearly every\r\ntwenty-four hours. Okay, I\'ll tape a slowed-down version of your blast\r\nfor the boys in the back room. You\'re doing fine."\r\n\r\n                 *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Not for much longer," Barnsley told him. "When do I get out of here?"\r\n\r\n"Any day," Sanchez reassured him. "It was some job to learn an alien\r\nlanguage with just your recordings and some of your educated guesses to\r\ngo on. We\'ve had a regular mob sweating on it night and day."\r\n\r\n"How is it coming?

=== Chunk 5 ===
"\r\n\r\n"It turns out they\'re nothing to worry about. The fleet is close enough\r\nnow to pick up their surface broadcasting. Believe me, your stupid act\r\nhas them thoroughly confused. They hold debates over whether you could\r\npossibly be intelligent enough to belong in a spaceship."\r\n\r\n"Meanwhile, I\'m slowly starving," said Barnsley.\r\n\r\n"Just hang on for a couple of days. Now that we know where they are,\r\nthey\'re in for a shock. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
One of these mornings, they\'re going to hear\r\nvoices from all over their skies, demanding to know what kind of savages\r\nthey are to have kidnapped you--and in their own language!"\r\n\r\nBarnsley grinned into his improvised pillow as Sanchez signed off.\r\nThings would really work out after all. He was set for an immensely\r\nlucrative position; whether as ambassador, trade consultant, or colonial\r\ngovernor depended upon how well the experts bluffed the blubber-heads.\r\nWell, it seemed only his due for the risks he had taken.\r\n\r\n"Omigosh!" he grunted, sitting up as he pictured the horde of Terran\r\nColonial experts descending upon the planet. "I\'ll be the only one here\r\nthat hasn\'t learned to speak the language!"\r\n\r\n                                END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
