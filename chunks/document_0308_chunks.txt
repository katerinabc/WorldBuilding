]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             The humblest events sometimes result from the\r\n            most grandiose beginnings. You\'d never imagine\r\n             space travel starting this way, for instance!\r\n\r\n\r\nI suppose there\'s a guy like McCleary in every office.\r\n\r\nNow I\'m not a hard man to get along with and it usually takes quite a\r\nbit more than overly bright remarks from the office boy to bother me.\r\nBut try as I might, I could never get along with McCleary. To be as\r\ndisliked as he was, you have to work at it.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of guy was he? Well, if you came down to the office one day\r\nproud as Punch because of something little Johnny or Josephine had\r\nsaid, it was a sure cinch that McCleary would horn in with something\r\nhis little Louie had spouted off that morning. At any rate, when\r\nMcCleary got through, you felt like taking Johnny to the doctor to find\r\nout what made him subnormal.\r\n\r\nOr maybe you happened to buy a new Super-eight that week and were\r\nbragging about the mileage, the terrific pickup, and how quickly she\r\nresponded to the wheel. Leave it to McCleary to give a quick run-down\r\non his own car that would make you feel like selling yours for junk at\r\nthe nearest scrap heap.\r\n\r\nWell, you see what I mean.\r\n\r\nBut by far the worst of it was when vacation time rolled around. You\r\ncould forgive a guy for topping you about how brainy his kids are, and\r\nyou might even find it in your heart to forget the terrific bargain he\r\ndrove to work in. But vacation time was when he\'d really get on your\r\nnerves. _You_ could pack the wife and kids in Old Reliable and roll out\r\nto the lake for your two weeks in August. You might even break the bank\r\nand spend the two weeks at a poor man\'s Sun Valley. But no matter where\r\nyou went, when you came back, you\'d have to sit in silence and listen\r\nto McCleary\'s account of his Vacation in the Adirondacks, or his Tramp\r\nin the Canadian Wilds, or maybe even the Old French Quarter.\r\n\r\nThe trouble was he always had the photographs, the ticket stubs, and\r\nthe souvenirs to prove it. Where he got the money, I\'ll never know.\r\nSometimes I\'d tell the wife about it and she\'d sniff and wonder what\r\nkind of shabby house they lived in that they could afford all the other\r\nthings. I never looked him up myself. Tell you the truth, I was afraid\r\nI\'d find the McClearys lived on Park Avenue.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow you look forward to a vacation all year, but particularly during\r\nthe latter part of July, when, what with the heat and the stuffy\r\noffice, you begin to feel like a half-done hotdog at a barbecue. I was\r\nfeeling even worse than usual as I was faced with spending my two weeks\r\nin my own backyard, most of my vacation dough having gone to pay the\r\ndoctor. The only thing I minded was having McCleary find out about it\r\nand seeing that phony look of sympathy roll across his fat face while\r\nhe rambled on about the vacation _he_ was going to have.\r\n\r\nIt was lunch time and we had just finished talking about the latest on\r\ntelevision and what was wrong with the Administration and who\'d win the\r\npennant when Bob Young brought up the subject of vacations. It turned\r\nout he was due for a trip to the Ozarks and Donley was going after\r\nwall-eye pike in northern Wisconsin. I could sense McCleary prick up\r\nhis ears clear across the room.\r\n\r\n"How about you, Bill?" Donley asked me. "Got any plans?"\r\n\r\nI winked heavily and jerked a thumb warningly toward McCleary, making\r\nsure McCleary couldn\'t see the gesture.\r\n\r\n"My vacation is really going to be out of the world this time," I said.\r\n"Me and the wife are going to Mars. Dry, you know. Even better than\r\nArizona for her sinus."\r\n\r\nEven with the wink they were caught off guard for a minute.\r\n\r\n"Mars?" Donley said feebly, edging his chair away. "Yeah, sure. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Great\r\nplace. Never been there myself, though.

=== Chunk 4 ===
"\r\n\r\nYoung just gaped, then grinned as he caught on. "I understand it\'s a\r\nwonderful spot," he chipped in.\r\n\r\nI casually peeled a hard-boiled egg the wife had packed in my lunch\r\nbucket and leaned back in my swivel chair. "It\'s really swell," I said\r\ndreamily, but loud enough so McCleary couldn\'t help but overhear.\r\n"Drifting down the Grand Canal at evening, the sun a faint golden disk\r\nbehind the crystal towers of Marsport...." I let my voice drift into a\r\nlong sigh and reached for Donley\'s sack of grapes.\r\n\r\nAbout this time McCleary had gnawed his way through a big pastrami\r\nsandwich and waddled over. He stood there expectantly, but we carefully\r\nignored him.\r\n\r\n"Always wanted to go myself," Donley said in the same tone of voice he\r\nwould have used to say he\'d like to go to California someday. "Pretty\r\nexpensive, though, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Expensive?" 

=== Chunk 5 ===
I raised a studiedly surprised eyebrow. "Oh, I suppose\r\na little, but it\'s worth it. The wife and I got a roomette on the\r\n_Princess of Mars_ for $139.50. That\'s one way, of course."\r\n\r\n"Mars!" Young sighed wistfully.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of silence, with all three of us paying silent\r\ntribute to the ultimate in vacations. McCleary slowly masticated a leaf\r\nof lettuce, his initial look of suspicion giving way to half-belief.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s hear some more about it," Young said enthusiastically, suddenly\r\nrecovering from his reverie.\r\n\r\n"Oh, there isn\'t much more," I said indifferently. "We plan to stay at\r\nthe Redsands hotel in Marsport--American plan. Take in Marsport, with\r\nmaybe a side trip to Crystallite. If we have time we might even take a\r\nwaterway cruise to the North Pole...."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI broke off and dug Donley in the ribs.\r\n\r\n"Man, you never fished until you have a Martian flying fish at the end\r\nof the line!" I grabbed a ruler off the desk and began using it as an\r\nimaginary rod and reel. "Talk about fight ... oh, sorry, Mac." My ruler\r\nhad amputated part of a floppy lettuce leaf that hung from McCleary\'s\r\nsandwich.\r\n\r\nI settled down in my chair again and started paying attention to my\r\nlunch. "Nothing like it," I added between mouthfuls of liverwurst.\r\n\r\n"How about entertainment?" Young winked slyly.\r\n\r\n"Well, you know--the wife will be along," I said. "But some of the\r\nplaces near the Grand Canal--and those Martian Mist Maidens! Brother,\r\nif I was unattached...."\r\n\r\n"There ain\'t any life on Mars," McCleary said, suspicious again.\r\n\r\nAll three of us looked at him in shocked silence.\r\n\r\n"He says there\'s no life on Mars!" Donley repeated.\r\n\r\n"You ever been there, McCleary?" I asked sarcastically.\r\n\r\n"No, but just the same...."\r\n\r\n"All right," I cut in, "then you don\'t know whether there is or isn\'t.\r\nSo kindly reserve your opinion until you know a little about the\r\nsubject under discussion."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI turned back to Donley and Young.\r\n\r\n"Really a wonderful place for your health. Dry, thin air, nice and cool\r\nat night. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
And beautiful! From Marsport you can see low-slung mountains\r\nin the distance, dunes of soft, red sand stretching out to them. If\r\nI were you, Bob, I\'d forget all about the Ozarks and sign up on the\r\nrocket."\r\n\r\n"There ain\'t any rockets going to Mars," McCleary said obstinately.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t," I corrected. "I mean, there is. Besides, McCleary, just\r\nbecause you never heard of something doesn\'t mean it doesn\'t exist."\r\n\r\n"The government\'s still working on V-2," McCleary said flatly. "They\r\nhaven\'t even reached the moon yet."\r\n\r\nI sighed softly, acting disgusted at having to deal with somebody as\r\nstupid as McCleary. "Mac, that\'s the government and besides they\'re\r\ndealing with military rockets. And did you ever hear of the government\r\nperfecting something before private industry? Who perfected the\r\ntelephone, the radio, television? The government? 

=== Chunk 7 ===
No, private industry,\r\nof course! Private industry has always been ahead of the government on\r\neverything, including rockets. Get on the stick, Mac."\r\n\r\nMcCleary started in on his lettuce leaf again, looking very shrewd.\r\n\r\n"How come I never heard of it before now?" he asked, springing the\r\nclincher argument.\r\n\r\n"Look, Mac, this is relatively new. The company\'s just starting, can\'t\r\nafford to take full-page ads and that sort of thing. Just give \'em\r\ntime, that\'s all. Why, a couple of years from now you\'ll be spending\r\nyour vacation on Venus or Jupiter or some place like that. From now on\r\nCalifornia and the Bahamas will be strictly old hat."\r\n\r\nMcCleary looked half-believing.\r\n\r\n"Where\'d you get your tickets?"\r\n\r\nI waved vaguely in the direction of downtown. "Oh, there must be at\r\nleast a couple of agencies downtown. Might even be able to find them in\r\nthe phone book. Look under _Interplanetary Rocket Lines_ or something\r\nlike that. You might have a little difficulty, of course. Like I say,\r\nthey\'re not too well advertised."\r\n\r\nMcCleary was about to say something more, but then the one o\'clock bell\r\nrang and we went back to the office grind.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWell, McCleary didn\'t say anything more about it the next day, even\r\nthough we\'d throw in a chance comment about Mars every now and then, as\r\nif it were the most natural thing in the world, but Mac didn\'t rise to\r\nthe bait. We gradually forgot about it.\r\n\r\nThe next couple of weeks came and went and then my two weeks in August.\r\nLike I said before, my vacation dough had gone to pay the doctor, so I\r\nstayed at home and watered the begonias.\r\n\r\nThe Monday morning after vacation, we were all back in the office, if\r\nanything looking more fagged than we had when we left. When lunch time\r\nrolled around, Donley and Young and I piled our lunches on Donley\'s\r\ndesk--his desk was near a window on the north side of the building\r\nso we could get the breeze--and talked about what we had done during\r\nvacation.\r\n\r\nMcCleary ambled up and like it usually does after McCleary comes\r\naround, the conversation just naturally died down. After a two minute\r\nsilence I finally took the hook.\r\n\r\n"Okay, Mac," I said, "I know you\'re just dying to tell us. Where did\r\nyou go?"\r\n\r\nHe almost looked surprised. "To Mars," he said, like he might have said\r\nAunt Minnie\'s.\r\n\r\nThe three of us looked blank for a minute and then we caught on. It\r\ntook us a while to recover from laughing and my sides were still aching\r\nwhen I saw McCleary\'s face. It definitely had a hurt look on it.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t think I did," he accused us.\r\n\r\n"Oh, come off it, McCleary," I said crossly. "A gag\'s a gag, but it can\r\nbe carried too far. Where\'d you go? California, Oregon, some place like\r\nthat?"\r\n\r\n"I said I went to Mars," McCleary repeated hotly, "and I can prove it!"\r\n\r\n"Sure," I said. "Like I can prove the world\'s flat and it\'s supported\r\nby four elephants standing on a turtle\'s back like the old Greeks...."\r\n\r\nI cut off. McCleary had thrown a couple of pasteboards on the desk and\r\nI picked them up. The printing on it was like you see on a Pullman\r\nticket. It said something about a roomette, first-class passage on the\r\n_Martian Prince_, for $154.75, and there was even a place where they\r\nhad the tax figured. In two blanks at the top of the ticket, they had\r\nit filled out to _E. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
C. McCleary and wife_. The bottom half was torn\r\noff, just like they do with train tickets.\r\n\r\n"Very clever," I said, "but you shouldn\'t have gone to all that trouble\r\nto have these printed up."\r\n\r\nMcCleary scowled and dropped a little bunch of kodachrome slides on the\r\ndesk. I took one and held it up to the light. It showed Mac and his\r\nwife mounted on something that looked like a cross between a camel and\r\na zebra. They were at the top of a sand dune and in the distance you\r\ncould see the towers of a city. The funny thing was the towers looked a\r\nlittle--but not much--like minarets and the sand dunes were colored a\r\nbeautiful pink.\r\n\r\nI passed it on to Donley and Young and started leafing through the\r\nrest. They were beautiful slides. McCleary and spouse in front of\r\nvarious structures in a delicately tinted marble and crystal city.\r\nMcCleary in a pink-and-black boat on a canal that looked as wide as the\r\nMississippi. McCleary standing on a strangely carved sandstone parapet,\r\nadmiring a sunset caused by a sun looking half as big as ours. And\r\neverywhere were the dunes of pink sand.\r\n\r\n"Pictures can be faked, Mac," I said.\r\n\r\nHe looked hurt and got some things out of his desk--a sateen pillow\r\nwith scenes like those on his snapshots, an urn filled with pink sand,\r\na tiny boat like a gondola, only different, a letter opener made out\r\nof peculiar bubbly pink glass. They were all stamped "Souvenir of\r\nMars" and that kind of junk you don\'t have made up for a gag. I know\r\nmass-produced articles when I see them.\r\n\r\n"We couldn\'t afford the first-class tour," McCleary said expansively,\r\n"but I figure we can cover that next year." He turned to me puzzledly.\r\n"I asked the passenger agent about the _Princess of Mars_ and he said\r\nhe had never heard of the ship. And it\'s Mars City, not Marsport.\r\nCouldn\'t understand how you made a mistake."\r\n\r\n"It was easy," I said weakly. I pointed to the pasteboard ducats.\r\n"Where\'d you get these, Mac?"\r\n\r\nHe waved generously in the direction of downtown. "Like you said,\r\nthere\'s a couple of agencies downtown...."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYou know, sometimes I think we misjudged McCleary. It takes a while to\r\nget to know a guy like Mac. Maybe his Louie _is_ brighter than Johnny,\r\nand maybe his chugmobile _is_ something terrific.\r\n\r\nFor the last few years, all on account of Mac, my two weeks in August\r\nhave really been well spent Beautiful! Why, from Mars City you can\r\nsee low-slung mountains in the distance and dunes of soft, red sand\r\nstretching out to them. And the sunsets when you\'re standing on the\r\nparapets of that delicate crystal city.... And, man, fishing in the\r\nGrand Canal....\r\n\r\nHow do you get to Mars? There\'s probably a couple of agencies in your\r\nown town. You can look them up in your phone book under "Vacation at\r\nthe Planets of Pleasure" or something like that. They might be a little\r\ndifficult to find, though.\r\n\r\nYou see, they\'re not very well advertised yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s Two Weeks in August, by Frank M.
