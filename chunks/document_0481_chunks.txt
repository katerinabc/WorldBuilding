As he checked each passing face against a card-index mind,\r\nhe smiled to himself. Even when off duty, the habit persisted. There\r\nwas always the chance he\'d spot a face that would fit, one that would\r\nclose another active file in Missing Persons Bureau.\r\n\r\nA mousey little guy slipped through a turnstile and bumped into a fat\r\nwoman shopper. Engel glanced at the thin apologetic face and then at a\r\nbriefcase bearing the faded initials, "C. G." As a train rumbled in and\r\nthe noise of the commuters rose, something glinted at Engel\'s feet. He\r\nbent down, curious.\r\n\r\nIt was a cheap fountain pen inscribed with the same initials. He caught\r\na glimpse of the stranger on the crowded subway stairs.\r\n\r\n"Wait a minute, mister!" he yelled.\r\n\r\nWhen C. G. didn\'t turn, Engel hesitated, then pounded up the stairs\r\ninto dazzling sunlight. He squinted around at people and then over\r\nlow bushes into the city park where he saw the little fellow walking\r\nbriskly. Annoyed, Engel trotted down a shady walk, then down a quiet\r\nlane and finally reached out to tap his shoulder.\r\n\r\nC. G. vanished in thin air.\r\n\r\nEngel slid to a halt and rubbed his eyes. Fearfully he explored this\r\nqueer illusion, his hands pawing nothingness. There was a roar like a\r\nthousand subway trains, and something invisible and powerful hurled him\r\nsprawling. He lay stunned as the noise died away and then sat up to\r\nnurse a bruised head.\r\n\r\nSomeone grabbed his arms, jerked him rudely to his feet, and spun him\r\naround. A tall gangling cop glared down at him.\r\n\r\n"You been drinking?"\r\n\r\n"W-what?" Engel stammered. Confused, he looked more closely at this\r\nman who wore a gray metallic uniform, a glittering badge, and an oddly\r\nshaped holster. "I wasn\'t drinking. Something pushed me."\r\n\r\nThe cop smirked as he picked up the fountain pen and dusted it off with\r\nhis gloves. "This yours?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes--uh, why, no," Engel sputtered. "It belongs to a guy I was\r\nchasing."\r\n\r\nThe cop\'s thick eyebrows lifted.\r\n\r\n"He lost it, and I was trying to return it," Engel explained. "But he\r\ndisappeared right in front of me!"\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s a new one," the cop said with a cynical smile. He seized\r\nEngel\'s arm and dragged him down the walk. "I\'m running you in as a\r\ndrunk and robbery suspect, bud."\r\n\r\n"But I didn\'t do anything!" protested Engel.\r\n\r\nThe cop scowled. "We\'ll see. If you\'re innocent, you\'ll get out of\r\nC. D. in a few minutes."\r\n\r\n"C. D.?" Engel echoed. C. D.? C. G.? C. D.? The initials hopped wildly\r\nabout in his mind. At a soft whistling sound he glanced up above a high\r\nhedge and his eyes widened. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Gleaming white towers rose up to fade into\r\nmisty blue, and around them silently darted silvery bubbles. Faintly\r\ntraced with jointed, concentric lines, the sky seemed to curve over him\r\nlike a lofty and enormous spider web.\r\n\r\nAs he was pulled across a wide street, tall, hollow-cheeked people\r\nstopped to stare at him, and he stared back in wonder.\r\n\r\n"Who are they?" Engel faltered.\r\n\r\nThe cop said nothing and led him through the low entrance of a tower.\r\nAs they went down a glowing hall, Engel touched the back of his still\r\naching head. Was his fall in the park causing these hallucinations?\r\nPossibly. But before the fall, hadn\'t some mysterious, unseen force\r\nthrown him into this crazy world? Then he had to find it again and\r\nsomehow escape back to reality!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey entered a large room where lines of gaunt, solemn people stood\r\ngravely before grill windows. _The Enemy is Listening!_ a sign on a\r\nwall warned him as a loudspeaker blared out a garbled message. The cop\r\nshoved him into a line. Finally the man ahead of them fidgeted up to an\r\nugly, hatchet-faced woman who frowned impatiently.\r\n\r\n"Yes?" she snapped.\r\n\r\n"My wife deserted me," the scarecrow of a man complained. "I want to--"\r\n\r\n"Fill out this form, drop it in slot 9," she rapped out. "Next?"\r\n\r\n"A drunk and robbery suspect," the cop said. "Here\'s the evidence."\r\n\r\nBrightening, Hatchet-Face snatched up the fountain pen and whisked out\r\na blue card. "Misdemeanor and felony," she breathed sharply. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
"I\'ll take\r\nthe details."\r\n\r\nEngel clung to the edge of the window counter as the interrogation\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\nYes, he told them, he actually believed something invisible had knocked\r\nhim down after swallowing up the stranger. No, he hadn\'t robbed the\r\nstranger, he wasn\'t confessing anything. Yes, he was an honest citizen\r\nwith no previous criminal offenses. After more probing questions and\r\nvicious jabs at the form, she handed it to the cop who dropped it in a\r\nnearby wall slot. They waited for a verdict.\r\n\r\nIn a moment the cop turned to Hatchet-Face who whispered with him\r\nexcitedly. Flushed and triumphant, he steered Engel out into the hall.\r\n"Alien Detection wants you," he growled with uneasy respect.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey got into an elevator and shot swiftly upward. As they stepped\r\ninto a lavish reception room filled with sickeningly sweet perfume, a\r\nscrawny, over-rouged girl shut a magazine and jumped to a switchboard.\r\nThen a door opened, and a short, puffy man with cold fish-eyes bounced\r\nup to them. Waving the cop away, he gripped Engel\'s hand.\r\n\r\n"Ah, Mr. Engel!" 

=== Chunk 5 ===
he said smiling. "I\'m Commissioner Marston. Sorry\r\nabout the mix-up, but we didn\'t realize you were after C. G. Come in,\r\nplease."\r\n\r\nBewildered, Engel followed him into an office and looked through\r\nspacious windows down at the spires of a city he had never known.\r\nBeside a desk sat a wizened old man whose yellowed skin drawn taut\r\nover his broad skull gave him a shriveled, cadaverous aspect. He\r\ntapped a blue card on a thumbnail as his luminous eyes followed Engel\r\nsuspiciously.\r\n\r\n"Doctor Weeve, my chief alienologist," Marston said. "Sit down, Engel."\r\n\r\nEngel grasped the arms of his chair as Dr. Weeve scrutinized the card\r\nin silence.\r\n\r\n"Jeffrey Engel," he read aloud in a high petulant voice. "Missing\r\nPersons Bureau, eh? 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Hmm, reminiscent of the twentieth century. Is that\r\nwhat you call your detective agency?"\r\n\r\n_Reminiscent of...._ Engel pressed shaky fingers to his throbbing head.\r\nIf he told them he was from out of the past, how would they react?\r\n"Yes," he lied, "I found a fountain pen--"\r\n\r\n"You lone wolves have extraordinary hunches to compensate for a lack of\r\npolice techniques," Dr. Weeve said with a dry chuckle. "But one needs\r\nprotection when tracking aliens."\r\n\r\n"Tracking aliens?" Engel said, mystified.\r\n\r\nMarston laughed, leaned over his desk, and twirled a fountain pen in\r\npudgy fingers. "Take it easy, you\'re not suspect in this case. But the\r\nreport says you found this pen and in attempting to return it to its\r\nowner, you were struck by some invisible force." Marston glanced at\r\nDr. Weeve who nodded, then his voice grew hard. "Did this C. G. aim\r\nanything at you before you were hit?"\r\n\r\n"No, he didn\'t," Engel said and touched his head nervously.\r\n\r\n"Headache?" Dr. Weeve asked.\r\n\r\n"No, it\'s nothing," Engel countered. "When I got up, the man was gone."\r\n\r\n"You mean the alien was gone," Dr. Weeve contradicted him.\r\n\r\nEngel\'s throat went dry and he stared at them.\r\n\r\n"An alien!" shouted Marston. "Don\'t you understand?"\r\n\r\nDr. Weeve smiled thinly. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
"Mr. Engel\'s curious to learn the latest\r\nabout them and would draw us out in this childish way. I assure you we\r\ndespise them far more than millions who only read about them in their\r\ndaily telescripts. Since the flying saucer crash in \'68, we\'ve been\r\nvery much aware of their close surveillance of this world."\r\n\r\nThe doctor\'s face clouded as he gazed at the city. "The filthy blue\r\nspawn of Centauri send us exceedingly clever spies. Before invading\r\nour cities, they must seek out our military installations and plant\r\nexplosives at key points. Their assassins must be ready to strike...."\r\n\r\nDr. Weeve gently wrung bony hands, and Marston leaned forward, his pale\r\njowls quivering angrily. "To safeguard public welfare, this city branch\r\nof Alien Detection must find and exterminate aliens. So far we can\r\nboast of a perfect record, thanks to the new detection screen."\r\n\r\nAliens? Engel winced, recalling the mournful little stranger. "I can\'t\r\nbelieve that he--"\r\n\r\n"That he\'s a humanoid?" Marston spat out the word as if it were a lump\r\nof vileness in his throat. "C. G.\'s a sneaking saboteur who conceals\r\nhis ugly blue hide under a layer of false skin! But he\'s been detected."\r\n\r\n"He\'s detected?" Engel gasped.\r\n\r\nDr. Weeve inclined his vulture-like head quizzically. "For an\r\nintelligent man, Mr. Engel, you seem rather poorly informed." He\r\nreached to a cabinet, and across a cathode ray screen trembled a narrow\r\nribbon of light.\r\n\r\n"As you know," he said, "every act of an organism is preceded by an\r\nattitude, and that attitude takes the form of electromagnetic brain\r\nwaves. The detection screen is quite simple. Sensitive electronic\r\ndevices under the city dome pick up, amplify, and transmit brain waves\r\nto the central control here. Deviations from the social norm-wave are\r\npromptly investigated."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe ran a gnarled finger along the ribbon of light. "Note the low,\r\nrhythmic pulsations of the norm-wave--a happy citizen at a social task\r\nsomewhere in the city." He adjusted a dial, and on the screen flashed a\r\nspasmodically twitching band. "A variation of anti-social type three--a\r\ncitizen planning murder. Criminal Detection has a police detail\r\nobserving him, and before he can strike, they\'ll take him in custody.\r\nNow C. G., the pseudo-man we\'re having shadowed."\r\n\r\nA jagged white band leaped in a wild dance.\r\n\r\n"Even cerebral abnormalities don\'t register this violently," the doctor\r\nsaid. "The electrical impulses of his artificial brain are powerful.\r\nThe detectors easily penetrate his feeble brain shield. He thinks he\r\nmoves unnoticed on his evil mission--but look at his tremendous pent-up\r\nhatred and fear!"\r\n\r\nEngel stiffened, his palms moist with sweat. C. G. was somewhere in\r\nthis city of the future. Of course he was feeling terrified--but these\r\nwitch-hunters were mistaking that terror for something else! He choked\r\nat a sudden thought. Why hadn\'t they discovered his own fear yet? Was\r\nhis head injury somehow protecting him from their sensitive machines?\r\n\r\nDr. Weeve was regarding him stonily.\r\n\r\n"Ingenious!" Engel blurted out.\r\n\r\nMarston placed an automatic on his desk and beside it a box of shells.\r\n"Yes, ingenious," he said, grinning, "but luckily for me these gadgets\r\ncan\'t do everything. Trapping the alien is next, and that\'s my\r\ndepartment. Show him the Tracer Room, doctor."\r\n\r\nNervously trailing Dr. Weeve, Engel went to a steel door and peered\r\nthrough a window. For a moment it seemed as if he were high above the\r\ntwinkling lights of a city at night until he made out a dark, sunken\r\nroom and skeletal figures with earphones clamped to their long heads.\r\nThey bent over a flat surface illuminated with bright grid lines and\r\nsprinkled over with a myriad glowing dots. Gaunt shadowy faces were\r\nfixed on a pip of light.\r\n\r\n"They place him on the east side of Baxter Avenue between 43rd and 44th\r\nstreets," Dr. Weeve explained. He rubbed a lean jaw, frowning. "But\r\nhow the detectors failed to pick up his presence before he reached the\r\ncivic center baffles us. Seems as if he just popped up there."\r\n\r\n"I\'m ready for the kill, gentlemen!" crowed Marston, slapping the\r\nholster strapped to his side. "You look pretty impressed, Engel."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, I am," Engel managed to say.\r\n\r\nWith the doctor close behind, he followed Marston apprehensively down\r\na corridor to a thick convex window. Marston slid it back and stepped\r\ninto what resembled a bowl-shaped cockpit, a confusing maze of dials\r\nand instruments under a hemisphere of glass. Motioning Engel to a seat,\r\nhe turned to the dashboard, and the same spot of light which Engel had\r\nseen in the Tracer Room flashed on a screen. He jabbed a button twice\r\nand picked up a microphone.\r\n\r\n"Marston to Captain Schaeffer. We\'re coming down.

=== Chunk 8 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir. The alien\'s turned back," a strained voice replied. "He\'s\r\nnow walking south on Baxter. Might be on to us, he\'s acting jumpy."\r\n\r\n"You sound jumpy yourself, Schaeffer," Marston snapped. "Tell your men\r\nto hold their fire this time! All right, I have him on optibeam."\r\n\r\nMarston spun a wheel sharply, and they were falling. Engel braced\r\nhimself as a white glistening tower swung away to their left, and the\r\ngeometric depths of the city loomed up. He saw the doctor take a gun\r\nfrom a compartment, check it, and stand up wavering. His face was a\r\nmask of suppressed hate.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll dispatch him quickly," he hissed.\r\n\r\nEngel squirmed. To prevent a ruthless murder he\'d have to not only\r\noutwit these men but countless police besides. What was worse, with his\r\nheadache almost gone, his own uncontrollable waves of fear might expose\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"He\'s running," Marston said with a nod at the screen. As the globe\r\nshot down past white towers, a spotlight on the glass roof flashed red,\r\nand a shrill siren stung Engel\'s ears. Ahead of them a big globe fled\r\nout of their way, its passengers looking back at them, frightened.\r\nBlack dots on the street scurried to the towers.\r\n\r\n"I see him!" Dr. Weeve screeched.\r\n\r\nBelow them a man was running past a gray wall of huddled people. He\r\nlooked at them, dropped a briefcase, and sprinted into the deserted\r\nstreet. Marston chuckled into the mike. "We have him, Schaeffer. Not\r\nputting up much of a fight, is he?

=== Chunk 9 ===
"\r\n\r\n"No, sir."\r\n\r\nMarston glided the globe a few yards above and slightly behind his\r\nquarry. As Engel stared down at the man\'s flapping coat and thin, blond\r\nhair, he clenched his fists. It was C. G. The siren moaned to a stop,\r\nand in the sudden silence that filled the globe he could hear weary\r\nfootsteps and anguished breathing. Heavy-lidded eyes narrowed at Engel.\r\n\r\n"Recognize him?"\r\n\r\nEngel\'s mouth opened, and his throat tightened. He closed his eyes and\r\nnodded.\r\n\r\n"Halt, alien!" Marston\'s voice boomed over a loudspeaker.\r\n\r\nC. G. whirled, and they saw a soiled, rumpled suit and a trembling\r\nsmall face. A tear spilled down one cheek.\r\n\r\n"W-who are you?" he cried out. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
"What do you want?"\r\n\r\nMarston put the muzzle of his automatic through a gun port and fired.\r\nC. G. screamed and fell. Then in bright dusty sunlight he rolled on one\r\nside, groaning, and clutched his arm where a dark stain spread slowly\r\ndown his sleeve.\r\n\r\n"You disappoint us, alien," Marston rasped. "Where\'s your espionage\r\ntraining? Where\'s the cunning to test our wits?"\r\n\r\nSoft, pitiful sobs answered Marston who barked, "Get up and run for\r\nyour life!"\r\n\r\nC. G. got up and limped away, and Dr. Weeve turned in surprise. "What\r\nare you waiting for? Why don\'t you finish him?"\r\n\r\nMarston grinned. "He\'s headed for the park so I\'ll finish him there.\r\nI\'d like some old style hunting."\r\n\r\n"Are you taking leave of your senses?" exclaimed Dr. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
Weeve. "What about\r\nthe weapon he used on Engel? Without this armorglass, you\'re risking\r\nyour life!"\r\n\r\n"If he has a weapon, why didn\'t he use it?" Marston fumed. "It\'s\r\nprobably in that briefcase he dropped." He bellowed into the mike,\r\n"Clear the park!"\r\n\r\nNumbly Engel watched C. G. stumble past police riflemen at the end of\r\nthe street and crawl into dense shrubbery. The globe zoomed ahead, then\r\npoised motionless over treetops as Marston searched for his prey.\r\n\r\n"Watch for him!" Marston whispered huskily.\r\n\r\nBut Engel watched the screen in horror. A telltale circle of light, its\r\nrim overlapping that of C. G.\'s, burned steadily brighter. An alarm\r\nbell rang on the instrument panel. 

=== Chunk 12 ===
Dr. Weeve raised a claw-like hand to\r\na switch, then eyed Engel queerly. "Something wrong?" 

=== Chunk 13 ===
he said. "Stomach\r\nqueasy?"\r\n\r\nHis eyes fell on the screen. "Another alien!" he shrieked.\r\n\r\nDr. Weeve\'s thin lips parted and his fingers fumbled at the safety\r\ncatch of his gun. Engel hurled him aside and grabbed at the wheel. The\r\nglobe keeled crazily, the trees rushed up at them. With a dull crash\r\nthe glass shattered, and struggling out of Marston\'s flabby arms, Engel\r\nkicked open the door and dropped to earth. He scrambled to his feet\r\nand crashed through high bushes, ducking as a lance of flame charred\r\nbranches overhead.\r\n\r\n"There\'s two of them!" Marston\'s choked voice thundered and\r\nreverberated against distant towers.\r\n\r\nEngel paused in a dark glade to hear a police whistle shrill and a dry\r\ncrackling grow louder behind him. Stealthily he crept toward sunlight.\r\nWith a shock he saw C. G. sitting in the open, exposed and dejected,\r\nhis head bowed in pain. Engel dashed over to him, hoisted him on his\r\nshoulders, and staggered over thick grass to a gravel walk. Then the\r\nground beneath him quaked. The hoarse cries of the hunters faded.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGently he lowered C. G. to a park bench, and an old man nodding in the\r\nwarm sunshine raised bleary, astonished eyes. Engel turned to see a\r\nnurse pushing a baby carriage and the old, familiar skyline of the city\r\nsmiling down on them. He shook with relief. 

=== Chunk 14 ===
Like an enraptured music\r\nlover he listened to the faint roar of traffic.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t let them kill me!" C. G. cried.\r\n\r\n"Winos with the d.t.s," the old man muttered and stomped off.\r\n\r\n"They\'re gone--all gone!" Engel shouted.\r\n\r\nThe little fellow groaned, pressing his wound. "You helped me--your\r\nworld need not fear us...."\r\n\r\nEngel spoke to him comfortingly. "Hold on, buddy, I\'ll get a doctor."\r\nHe pushed his way through a gathering crowd to a telephone booth. As he\r\nstepped inside, he saw C. G. limp quickly to the subway stairs. By the\r\ntime he had hurried back, the little fellow was gone.\r\n\r\nPuzzled, Engel reached for a hand railing to steady himself. He had\r\nlived a nightmare filled with obsessed men who dreaded blue-skinned\r\naliens from a distant world! He touched something sticky and realized\r\nthe bleeding C. G. must have clung to the railing as he descended. Then\r\nhe suddenly hoped he was mistaken. The dark blotch on his fingers\r\ncould be wet paint. It had to be.\r\n\r\nIt was blue....\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
