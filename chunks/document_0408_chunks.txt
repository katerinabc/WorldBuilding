But he hadn\'t counted on the menace of\r\nFatty Schultz and Irv Lece.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE UNWILLING\r\n  PROFESSOR\r\n\r\n  by Arthur Porges\r\n\r\n  (_illustrated by Milton Luros_)\r\n\r\n\r\nOn that fateful afternoon Fatty Schultz and Irv Lece had cut their last\r\nclasses, and were taking a gloomy walk together, scrambling through the\r\nscrubby brush well behind the athletic field.\r\n\r\nThere were good reasons for their unhappiness. Fatty was failing in\r\nCalculus II with a velocity that varied directly as the square of the\r\nnumber of lectures attended. Irv\'s math instructor had informed _him_,\r\nwith a kind of loathing respect, that his only salvation lay in\r\nrecommencing the study of arithmetic--taking five or ten years in the\r\nprocess--and then retiring to a cave for perhaps another fifteen in the\r\nvain hope of digesting, through meditation and prayer, the\r\nmultiplication table. After that, Irv might be ready for elementary\r\nalgebra, but not, the professor hoped to a merciful God, in this\r\nunfortunate institution of higher learning.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the whole of their fraternity, Omega Pi Upsilon\r\n(usually referred to on campus as "Oh, P-Yu") was in the same boat\r\nregarding almost every subject offered at Bateman College. Bateman had\r\ncourses that ranged from Aardvark Breeding to Zythum Brewing, but no\r\nfield of knowledge troubled them more than mathematics.\r\n\r\nHence the long face on Irv Lece. Fatty\'s visage also strove to elongate,\r\nbut simply wasn\'t built for such an accomplishment. Instead, his piggy\r\nlittle eyes, ordinarily glowing with a kind of coarse good-humor, were\r\nnow smouldering with resentment.\r\n\r\nThey had just seated themselves in a small clearing, where Fatty, after\r\nsetting his calculus text on a grassy mound, began to heave rocks at it,\r\nwhen there was a whistling scream, a jarring _whump_, and before their\r\nbulging eyes a small disc lay crumpled, barely ten yards away.\r\n\r\nA shrill creaking came from this odd craft, which looked like a\r\nmanhole-cover some eight feet in diameter and twenty inches thick. Then,\r\nas they stared in wonder, a badly-sprung port opened crazily, and a\r\nsmall rabbit flopped out. It may be stated here that the creature was\r\nnot actually a rabbit, but that any difference between the disc\'s pilot\r\nand an ordinary cottontail was imperceptible to the naked eye.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the rabbit swayed drunkenly, its big eyes cloudy, then it\r\nhopped towards Fatty, preferring, perhaps, his larger gravitational\r\nfield over Irv\'s. Extending one snowy paw, it squeaked: "Good afternoon,\r\ngentlemen. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
Permit me to introduce myself. I am a good-will ambassador\r\nfrom Venus, and by your conventions should be addressed as \'Professor.\'\r\nMy name," he added a trifle pompously, "is Iglowt P. Slakmak, and I hold\r\ndegrees comparable to your PhD, LLD, and M. D." All this in a very\r\nBritish accent.\r\n\r\nFatty gave a hoarse croak; Irv\'s knees knocked together.\r\n\r\n"Come," the rabbit chirped, "chin up, fellows! There\'s nothing to be\r\nafraid of. I speak English because we\'ve been monitoring your radio\r\nbroadcasts for years. Television is a bit trickier, but we\'ve seen a\r\nfew. And by listening to educational programs, I\'ve learned a great deal\r\nabout terrestrial culture, which I notice is based upon cigarettes, used\r\ncars--but never mind that, now. I must get to Washington and present\r\nmyself. A rival of mine is about to contact Mars for the first time, and\r\nI hope to send in my report on Earth first." He peered at them\r\nanxiously. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
"You do understand me, chaps, don\'t you? I learned the best\r\nEnglish from B. B. C., you know."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSeeing that the two boys were still dumb, the rabbit, with a mighty\r\neffort, picked up the three-pound calculus text, which was bound in a\r\nrevolting green. As he did so, a paper fluttered out, and the professor\r\ndeftly scooped it up. He studied Fatty\'s messy scrawlings for a moment,\r\nthen said warmly: "Ah, I observe that you chaps are beginning the study\r\nof elementary mathematics." He shook a paw waggishly. "The limits are\r\nwrong on this integration: they should go from pi-over-two to\r\npi-over-three first, instead of to zero. There\'s a discontinuity at\r\npi-over-three, and your result, that the center of gravity of this\r\nsix-inch cube is nine feet to the right, looks somewhat implausible."\r\n\r\nAt this, Fatty finally found his voice. "A discontinuity?" he gulped.\r\n"Whassat?"\r\n\r\n"Aw, you know," Irv rebuked him. "Old Cusp\'s been gassing about \'em for\r\ndays, now."\r\n\r\n"Has he? Well, what is it, if you\'re so smart?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t remember," Irv said brazenly, "but at least I heard the name\r\nbefore."\r\n\r\n"At pi-over-three," the rabbit broke in with authority, "the denominator\r\nof the integrand vanishes. To put it loosely, the function becomes\r\ninfinite."\r\n\r\nFatty looked at Irv; Irv gaped at Fatty. The piggy eyes lit up. "A\r\nrabbit that knows math!" Fatty breathed.\r\n\r\n"Knows it! He wrote the damn book--a real brain!" Irv exulted.\r\n\r\nOnce again their eyes met meaningly. "You always said," Irv remarked in\r\nan abstracted manner, "that you could lick the guy who invented calc."\r\n\r\n"I sure can," Fatty asserted, "but--" He paused; then with a speed\r\nsurprising in one of his bulk, his thick hands shot out, and Professor\r\nSlakmak, the eminent Venusian savant, found himself dangling by the ears\r\nfrom stubby, freckled fingers. He kicked with a vigor shockingly\r\nundignified.\r\n\r\n"Let me down!" he squeaked furiously. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
"This is outrageous. A friendly\r\nambassador\'s person is sacred among all civilized peoples; your national\r\nPresident shall hear of this insult!"\r\n\r\nFatty looked at him, showing uneven teeth in a loose grin. "Bugs Bunny,"\r\nhe gloated, "you are now the official mascot of Omega Pi Upsilen!"\r\n\r\n"I second the motion," Irv said, shuffling in excitement.\r\n\r\n"We\'d better hide his ship, though," Fatty cried, full of ingenious\r\nintelligence now that nobody was grading him for it.\r\n\r\n"It\'s too big, ain\'t it?" Irv replied doubtfully. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
"Simmer down you!" he\r\nordered the writhing professor. "We don\'t wanna choke you, but--" The\r\ncaptive subsided, contenting himself with little quivers of indignation.\r\n\r\n"It\'s awful light," Fatty muttered, shoving the damaged saucer with one\r\nsize eleven shoe. "We\'ll move it over here, pile a lot of brush on top,\r\nand--"\r\n\r\n"--Start a fire!" Irv interrupted joyously.\r\n\r\nThe professor gave a piercing squeal of protest.\r\n\r\n"No, stupid," Fatty told him, winking. "If the prof here helps us out\r\nthis semester, we\'ll give him back his old disc, right?"\r\n\r\n"Right," Irv agreed, crossing two fingers.\r\n\r\nIn fifteen minutes, even with Fatty working one-handed, the ship\r\nvanished under a pile of stiff brush. "That\'s that," Irv said, taking a\r\ndeep breath. "Now--"\r\n\r\n"We can\'t take him like this," Fatty remarked, swinging the professor by\r\nhis ears and giving him a shake by way of emphasis.\r\n\r\n"Why not? We just been rabbit-hunting, that\'s all."\r\n\r\n"Too risky. Even if the professor keeps quiet, some joker from another\r\nfrat might get nosy."\r\n\r\n"He\'ll be quiet," Irv said grimly. "I know how to hit a rabbit on the\r\nneck with the edge of my hand--" Here the professor began to kick\r\nfrantically, and Fatty snatched his hind legs, holding him rigid from\r\nears to toes.\r\n\r\n"There\'s an old cardboard box back there," Fatty said. "That\'ll do the\r\ntrick."\r\n\r\nA few seconds later the sullen captive was stuffed unceremoniously into\r\na damp, mouldy container, and the two students returned to the campus,\r\ntheir hearts free from mathematical worries.\r\n\r\n"The frat will owe us plenty for this," Fatty said darkly. "We\'ve never\r\nhad anybody to coach us in math."\r\n\r\n"They\'ll be licking our boots," Irv agreed. "But they always have, the\r\npoor dopes!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat night the professor, poorly refreshed by some wilted carrot tops\r\nand water, found himself in a circle of eager Omega Pi Upsilon\'s,\r\ndelivering a detailed lecture--mostly problem-solving--on Section 45 of\r\nBroota\'s "Introduction to the Elementary Rudiments of the Differential\r\nand Integral Calculus."\r\n\r\nHe was a good teacher, and when either his enthusiasm or expository art\r\nfaltered, Fatty revived it quickly with a sharp pinch or stinging slap.\r\nSo, although the average I. Q. of the fraternity was seventy-six, a\r\ncertain amount of mathematics get through; and it was almost midnight\r\nbefore the unhappy ambassador found himself lying in a dirty, fetid\r\ncage, formerly the residence of the fraternity parrot, who had expired\r\nfor lack of intellegent dialogue to copy. Rabbits, even Venusian ones,\r\ncannot weep, but the professor\'s soul was heavy within him.\r\n\r\nAnd so it went, day after day, week after week.\r\n\r\n"I am quite amazed," Professor Cusp told a skeptical colleague towards\r\nthe end of the term, "at the remarkable way Schultz and his Oh P-Yu\r\nbunch have improved. Their homework these last six weeks has been\r\nexcellent."\r\n\r\n"Somebody\'s coaching them--or doing it outright," was the cynical reply.\r\n"I find no improvement in their zoology."\r\n\r\n"No, that\'s what I suspected at first, but it can\'t be true. For\r\nexample, on last week\'s extra credit problem--a real stinker--they\r\nturned in over a dozen correct solutions, all different. Nobody would go\r\nto that much trouble for the P-Yu crowd; they\'re about as popular on\r\ncampus as Malenkov is with the D. A. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
R."\r\n\r\nAnother colleague, who had been listening, demanded: "But you won\'t let\r\nFatty Schultz by, will you?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll have to," Cusp admitted. "Even though his exams are still\r\nhorrible, I give quite a bit of weight to good homework, so--"\r\n\r\n"You swine!" the other said sourly. "Now I\'ll get him."\r\n\r\nCusp laughed. "Ah, but you\'re supposed to be tough; they\'re afraid of\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"They\'d better be. It\'s a pity the biology lab has to experiment on poor\r\nchimps while we give degrees to anthropoids like Fatty!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat night Fatty told his unwilling mascot the bad news. "I\'m sorry,\r\nProf," he said genially. "It\'s only one more term, then I\'ll be done\r\nwith math, and you can go back to your disc. By my last course is with\r\nold Totient, and he\'s rough."\r\n\r\n"You promised!" the professor squealed angrily.\r\n\r\n"This time I mean it, honest."\r\n\r\n"Hey, Fatty," a fraternity brother objected, "ain\'t you gonna leave the\r\nprof to our gang? Just cause _you\'re_ through--" He broke off in\r\nconfusion as Irv kicked his ankle, hard.\r\n\r\n"Ignore the jerk," Lece reassured the crestfallen rabbit. "When Fatty\r\nand I finish our math requirement, you\'re on your own again. Course,\r\nyou\'ll have to promise not to tell the President!" Over the professor\'s\r\nhead he winked broadly at his friends.\r\n\r\n"I won\'t do it! It\'s a cad\'s trick!" The rabbit\'s brown eyes were bright\r\nwith rage.\r\n\r\nFatty pawed his soft fur with one lardy hand. "C\'mon, Prof, be a sport,"\r\nhe urged, greasily affectionate. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
"We like you a lot. You wouldn\'t let us\r\ndown now."\r\n\r\n"I--will--not--do--it! You promised--"\r\n\r\n"You will, too!" Irv grunted. "Don\'t give us any backtalk. If I have to\r\ntwist your ears--"\r\n\r\n"Use the cigarette lighter," somebody suggested, half ashamed. "He\'s\r\nonly bluffing again."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not," the professor said sturdily. "You can burn me, kill me, but I\r\nwon\'t tutor this bunch of cretins any more!"\r\n\r\n"Where does he get those words?" 

=== Chunk 8 ===
a student wondered aloud. "What\'s a\r\ncretin?"\r\n\r\n"Irv," Fatty said in a sly, buttery voice, "where\'s that nasty pooch who\r\nadopted the Delts last week? The one that chased the chaplain into Tom\r\nPaine Hall. I\'ll bet he\'s a first class abbitray oundhay."\r\n\r\n"Mac," Irv addressed a slender, dark boy, "they keep him in that shed\r\nby the athletic field. Go and--ah borrow him, will you?" Mac left.\r\n\r\n"What\'s an abbitray oundhay?" the professor quavered.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll find out!" Fatty told him grimly. "Don\'t they teach pig-latin on\r\nVenus?"\r\n\r\nThere was a strained silence, while some members of the group whispered\r\nprotests. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
But there was no open resistance. Fatty and Irv ran Omega Phi\r\nUpsilon with an iron hand.\r\n\r\nThen the door opened, and Mac, tugging hard at the collar of a large\r\ndog, lurched into the room. "Here\'s Hotspur," he grinned, as the brute\r\nstrove to mangle the cowering professor.\r\n\r\nHotspur was a canine melting pot. The Spitz in his ancestry seemed to\r\npredominate, but there were plain traces of airdale, setter--and\r\ncrowning evidence of some mis-alliance--dachshund. White teeth bared in\r\na slavering snarl, the dog glared at the rabbit, lunging against his\r\ncollar as Mac held hard.\r\n\r\nBut the professor had collapsed, all his courage gone. "A dog!" he\r\ngasped in horror, and Hotspur seemed startled at the human voice\r\nemerging from a rabbit. A thin whimper came from the professor. "Take\r\nthat monster away," he begged. "I\'ll do anything--anything!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s better," Fatty chortled. "But we need this good ol\' hound more\r\nthan the Delts do. Put him down in the basement--just in case." He eyed\r\nthe professor, who shrank into a furry, abject heap.\r\n\r\n"My new prof, Dr. Totient, is tough," Fatty said. "Bugs Bunny here is\r\ngonna have plenty to do. We\'ll clear out now and let him prepare his\r\nassignments! See that you watch those signs," he jibed, handing out what\r\nhe had so long received. He fastened the rabbit\'s chain to its stout\r\nstaple in the wall. "Here." He fished an apple core from his jeans, and\r\ntossed it at the professor, giving him an oily smirk. "Just to show\r\nthere\'s no hard feeling. Eat hearty!" He stumped out, followed by his\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGradually it grew dark, and the deserted fraternity-house was quiet.\r\nRavenous, the professor finally nerved himself to nibble the apple core,\r\nwhich to his sensitive nostrils reeked of Fatty. He had just downed the\r\nlast noisome fragment, when there was a loud, inquisitive sniff at the\r\ndoor. He grew rigid. Another sniff and the shoulder thrust of a heavy\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nInsecurely shut, the door swung open, and a huge, white form stalked in.\r\nThe professor cringed, moaning a little, the hot alien scent of dog in\r\nhis nose, prepared to meet a terrible death.\r\n\r\n"Ssst!" the big mongrel admonished him. "I\'m a friend," he rumbled in\r\nslow, thick English. Trotting over, he took the slender chain in his\r\ngreat teeth, and threw his thirty pound body into the wrench. The staple\r\npulled free.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s get t\'hell out of here," he grunted, "while your bunch is gone."\r\n\r\n"B-but my ship," the professor stammered, staring in bewilderment. "It\'s\r\nbroken down, and those two awful boys will find me before I can fix it."\r\n\r\n"Never mind; I\'ll give you a lift in mine. I\'m heading for Washington,\r\nthen I\'ll have to report back on Mars. I can drop you either place. I\r\njust got word myself, only a few days ago, that our two planets had\r\nfinally made contact. They asked me to find out where you\'d disappeared\r\nto, but I never dreamed you were here. When I heard you talking\r\nEnglish--! But we\'d better scoot. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
I\'ve spied out this place long\r\nenough-- I don\'t think it\'s quite representative."\r\n\r\nThey had just reached the brush behind the library, where the\r\nprofessor\'s passionate story was completed, when Hotspur, looking back,\r\nsaw lights flash in the fraternity house windows.\r\n\r\n"Wait here," he said cryptically. "Be right back." He sprang into the\r\nbrush, and vanished. A few moments later, the anxious professor heard\r\nsome yells of agony coming from the campus, and before long Hotspur\r\nreturned, panting.\r\n\r\n"I know you\'ll get a sympathetic hearing in Washington," he gasped; "and\r\nwe Martians abhor violence, but there are times--" He rubbed one paw\r\nagainst his mouth. "I didn\'t like the taste of Irv, but Fatty\'s even\r\nworse! I hope," he added viciously, "they have to take Pasteur\r\ntreatments!"\r\n\r\n"Me too!" Professor Slakmak agreed cheerfully. "And best of all, they\'ll\r\nflunk math--but good!
