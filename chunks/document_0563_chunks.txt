Olbu\'s visit to the earth was certainly a bigger deal for\r\nthe archives than anything Caesar ever did.\r\n\r\n"No one can say you aren\'t a good sport," commended Ralph Rodkey of\r\nthe Interstate Broadcasting Network. "You had plenty of reason to be\r\nannoyed, especially when the mob tried to tear your clothes off. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
But,\r\nthe people meant no harm; they just adore you."\r\n\r\nOlbu had learned English overnight and mastered it. He hardly had an\r\naccent: "I was a little disturbed, you might say."\r\n\r\n"Well, our people are hero worshippers," Rodkey explained. "And\r\nyou\'re certainly a hero, being the first man from off the Earth to\r\nland on the Earth, you might say. And then too, given an opportunity\r\nto celebrate, an Earthman will take full advantage of the slightest\r\nexcuse."\r\n\r\n"Rather barbaric," said Olbu. "But then this is a barbaric planet."\r\n\r\n"Uh? Oh, yes. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Just joking, of course. Now we\'re about ready for\r\nour telecast with Cecil Burroughs, the greatest commentator in the\r\nbusiness. You\'ll appear with one of our leading scientists.

=== Chunk 4 ===
"\r\n\r\n"I hope he can understand the things I shall talk about."\r\n\r\n"We may not know much about space flight, but we know a lot of things,\r\nmy boy," said Rodkey.\r\n\r\n"You say you don\'t travel in space as yet?"\r\n\r\n"No, and you\'re the first visitor from space we\'ve had. You see, no\r\nplanets of this solar system are inhabited by intelligent forms of\r\nlife."\r\n\r\n"You can say that again," said Olbu.\r\n\r\n"With the exception of the Earth, of course." Rodkey laughed. "We were\r\nvery thrilled to have someone drop in on us."\r\n\r\n"How strange!"\r\n\r\n"In fact, many of our people figured that Man was unique. They thought\r\nhe couldn\'t exist anywhere but here."\r\n\r\n"It would be nice if such were the case," said Olbu. "But I\'m afraid\r\nthe galaxy is not so fortunate. Many planets have men. Some are more\r\nlike men than others, if you understand what I mean. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
But they all have\r\nhis chief faults and good points."\r\n\r\nRodkey had arranged for the interview in the Presidential suite of the\r\nClaremont Hotel and in the next room electricians were busy setting up\r\nthe equipment. Presently the door opened and a man of about 50, clean\r\nshaven and slightly bald, paused in the doorway. He looked at the\r\nconfusion for a moment, hesitated as if he were checking an impulse to\r\nflee, then spotted Rodkey through the bedroom door.\r\n\r\n"Dr. Bruber!" exclaimed Rodkey.\r\n\r\nDr. Alymir Bruber beamed, extended his hand and strode forward.\r\n\r\nHe tripped over a cable, but caught himself on the doorframe with\r\nnothing worse than a bumped shoulder.\r\n\r\nRodkey pumped his hand enthusiastically. "It\'s been a long time,\r\nDoctor!" 

=== Chunk 6 ===
he said, slapping him on the shoulder. "Remember, we met when\r\nI interviewed you on the nervous electron factor of your diatomic\r\nequivalent energy principle back in \'96."\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Bruber. "Yes, I remember you well." He turned his head\r\ntoward Olbu. One glance would have convinced anyone that Olbu was from\r\nspace--or at least another planet. He had an unusually large head,\r\nsmall neck, skinny arms and legs and a pot belly. Everyone knows that\r\npeople from other planets have all of these things. The only thing\r\nwrong with Olbu was that his eyes were just like anyone\'s eyes, a\r\nlittle slanted, perhaps, but not more so than the average oriental, and\r\nof course Olbu had no feelers extending from his forehead. But those\r\nthings weren\'t absolutely necessary in a man who looked the part, as\r\nOlbu did.\r\n\r\n"This must be our visitor!" 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Once more Dr. Bruber extended his hand and\r\nthis time he tripped over the rug, but Rodkey was handy to catch him.\r\n\r\n"My glasses," explained Dr. Bruber. "They\'re only bifocals, and I have\r\ntrouble adjusting to middle distances."\r\n\r\n"Olbu," said Rodkey, "allow me to present Dr. Bruber, the world\'s\r\ngreatest living scientist."\r\n\r\nDr. Bruber laughed nervously and shook hands with Olbu. "I\'m afraid Mr.\r\nRodkey is being extravagant. Actually I\'m not the greatest. Only the\r\ngreatest in my field. I\'m second greatest in three others though."\r\n\r\n"Dr. Bruber is too modest," said Rodkey. "There\'s practically nothing\r\nthat he doesn\'t know."\r\n\r\n"No one knows nothing," said Olbu.\r\n\r\nDr. Bruber blinked as he tried to figure that one out. It doubtless\r\nhinged on a lingual difference to start with and so he gave up.\r\n\r\n"Well, gentlemen," said Rodkey, "our broadcast will start in thirty\r\nminutes. Perhaps we can go over briefly what topics we should talk\r\nupon. You know we don\'t want to get into anything too deep for our\r\nviewers to understand, yet we don\'t want to be _too_ trivial, you know.\r\nGive them something interesting, I always say. Then if we have any time\r\nleft, we might touch on some topics that go a little beyond that."\r\n\r\n"Did you have a nice trip?" asked Dr. Bruber.\r\n\r\n"It was beastly," said Olbu. "Thirty-two light years of space and not\r\neven an interesting meteor."\r\n\r\n"We\'re on the verge of making an interplanetary flight here on Earth,"\r\nDr. Bruber said. "The trouble is, no one that wants a flight has any\r\nmoney and those that have the money don\'t care about space flight."\r\n\r\n"You\'re probably better off all around," said Olbu.\r\n\r\n"Come now, gentlemen," said Rodkey. "We can do better than that. You\r\ncan cut loose with a few scientific terms now and then. It gives the\r\ninterview an authentic flavor. Ask Olbu his opinion of the quantum\r\njump, Dr. Bruber."\r\n\r\nDr. Bruber turned toward the director and blinked through his heavy\r\nglasses. "I\'d rather ask our distinguished visitor why he came."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Dr. Bruber. Please do," said Olbu.\r\n\r\n"All right. Why did you come here?"\r\n\r\n"We wanted to decide whether to wipe out the solar system or not."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor a moment it was silent in the room, except for the sound of the\r\nelectricians outside the door. "Goddamit," said an electrician. "You\r\ncan\'t use that hookup on the Y-circuit. You\'ll cut out the monitors."\r\n\r\nRalph Rodkey tiptoed to the bedroom door and closed it.\r\n\r\n"Surely you\'re joking," said Dr. Bruber. "Quite a sense of humor.\r\nHa-Ha.

=== Chunk 8 ===
"\r\n\r\n"No, I\'m not. We discovered there was at least one habitable planet\r\nhere--and where there are habitable planets, there are likely to be\r\nhuman beings. Human beings are dangerous."\r\n\r\nRodkey cleared his throat. "Gentlemen. Far be it from me to interfere\r\nin a scientific discussion like this, but if I were you I\'d try another\r\ntack. A large number of our viewers might not understand it."\r\n\r\n"You think it would be better, perhaps, if we killed them all without\r\nwarning?" Olbu said, turning toward the director.\r\n\r\n"Really, Mr. Olbu," said Rodkey. "You don\'t intend to blot us out, do\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"That decision is hardly mine to make," said Olbu. "I\'ll have to report\r\nto my superiors. If you\'re dangerous, you\'ll have to be erased, and\r\nthere\'s nothing that can be done about it."\r\n\r\n"Excuse me a moment." Rodkey rose, went to the phone and ordered liquor\r\nsent up to the room. He hung up the receiver. "I think it\'s best that\r\nwe make your stay here a pleasant one, Olbu."\r\n\r\n"If you intend to bribe me, I\'m afraid you\'ll have no success," said\r\nOlbu. "I was chosen because I am impeccable."\r\n\r\n"I\'m quite sure of it," said Dr. Bruber. "And perhaps there is\r\nsomething in your premise that not all human beings are desirable. I\r\nshould like to know how Earth is making out."\r\n\r\nOlbu shrugged his shoulders. "So far I\'ve seen nothing worth saving,"\r\nhe said. "You\'re a vain lot. You\'re trivial. You have no respect for\r\nthe dignity of Man. And your worst fault is ambition. I suppose you\r\nhave wars?

=== Chunk 9 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Not for a long time. Two or three years anyhow," said Rodkey.\r\n\r\n"How long is a year? Ah yes, I forgot. It is the period of the planet\r\non its journey around the sun. And how long does that take? One year.\r\nThe usual nonsensical way you have of defining things. You don\'t even\r\nknow how to measure time."\r\n\r\n"How very interesting!" 

=== Chunk 10 ===
exclaimed Dr. Bruber. "Actually it never\r\noccurred to me that there might be an absolute method of measuring\r\ntime. What is it?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s the Mpto. Forty-three and a third Mptos make an Anup, and twelve\r\nmillion Anups make a Zorex. It\'s a lot simpler than seconds, minutes,\r\nhours, days, weeks and so on."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I see," said Dr. Bruber. "But getting back to our topic. Just\r\nwhat should we have that would make us worth saving?"\r\n\r\n"Stability," said Olbu. "Earthmen lack stability."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think you should talk more about your trip?" Rodkey asked.\r\n"How did Saturn look when you passed it?"\r\n\r\n"Saturn wasn\'t in the right place to be seen at all," Dr. Bruber said.\r\n"But you did see Pluto. How did it look?"\r\n\r\n"There was nothing about it and it looked awful," said Olbu.\r\n\r\n"I hate to be injecting my own personal ideas into this conversation,"\r\nsaid Rodkey, "because after all, I know nothing about science. But\r\ndon\'t you suppose it would please our viewers if we talked more about\r\nspace flight than about the destruction of the human race?"\r\n\r\n"You see," said Olbu to Dr. Bruber. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
"That\'s what I mean. No stability."\r\n\r\n"After all, the poor man doesn\'t want to lose his job," Bruber\r\nexplained. "I\'d say that was a desire to be stable."\r\n\r\n"If he\'s going to be dead, which he will be when I get word from my\r\nsuperiors, he\'ll lose his job whether he wants to or not," said Olbu.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go along with a joke as well as anyone," said Rodkey, "but\r\ngentlemen, we\'ve only got twelve minutes till we go on the air. Now\r\nlet\'s cut out this nonsense about destroying Earth and talk about\r\nsomething pleasant."\r\n\r\n"Certainly," said Dr. Bruber. "What planet did you come from?"\r\n\r\n"Xvik," said Olbu. "It\'s the fourth planet of a star you call GC1242."\r\n\r\n"Good old GC1242!" said Dr. Bruber.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you know that star?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, it\'s a minor variable loosely attached to Lyra."\r\n\r\n"There\'s nothing loose about my star," said Olbu.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure Dr. Bruber didn\'t mean it that way," said Rodkey hastily. He\r\nlooked nervously at Dr. Bruber. "Did you, doctor?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s one of the things I don\'t know," he said, wiping his glasses on\r\nhis handkerchief. "Tell me, Olbu, if you should decide we aren\'t worth\r\nsaving, how would you communicate with your superiors, considering\r\nthey\'re 32 light years away. Wouldn\'t it take 64 years--thirty-two\r\ngoing and thirty-two coming--to get a message through?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no! I communicate by instantaneous telepathy," said Olbu. "It\'s\r\nmuch faster than energy forms of communication."\r\n\r\n"I wish you\'d talk about something else," said Rodkey. "Only ten\r\nminutes to go."\r\n\r\nDr. Bruber disregarded the request. "I don\'t know why people on a\r\nplanet 32 light years away should consider Earth dangerous."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Earth isn\'t. It\'s only the people on it," said Olbu.\r\n\r\n"How do you know about the people?"\r\n\r\n"We have a method of enlarging telescopic photos to bring out every\r\ndetail. We know all about Man, we\'ve watched you from the days when\r\nyour ancestors lived in caves."\r\n\r\n"Goodness! You know more about us than we know ourselves."\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you tell our viewers about _that_!" exclaimed Rodkey.\r\n\r\n"Yes," went on Olbu, who also seemed to have forgotten the existence\r\nof Rodkey, "we saw your ancestors fight with sticks and stones. We\r\nsaw them use spears, then gunpowder. Then we saw the atom bomb and the\r\nCouncil decided to send me to see if anything could be salvaged."\r\n\r\n"But the bomb was 200 years ago," said Dr. Bruber.\r\n\r\n"Twelve Zorax," corrected Olbu. "I\'ve been on the way here for twelve\r\nZorax--or if you will--thirty-two light years, two hundred time years."\r\n\r\n"Surely the atom bomb can\'t affect your existence when we don\'t even\r\nhave space flight," said Dr. Bruber.\r\n\r\n"My race has developed a type of logic that can look into the future,"\r\nsaid Olbu. "We know that certain patterns develop from past events. In\r\nyour case, you\'ll follow the Atom bomb with the Hydrogen bomb, and the\r\nHydrogen bomb with the Cobalt bomb--"\r\n\r\n"We have them both."\r\n\r\n"Ah! You see. Our logical foresight is infallible," said Olbu.\r\n"Next you\'ll wipe out nations; when only one is left, you\'ll fight\r\nneighboring planets. Since you haven\'t any inhabited near neighbors,\r\nyou\'ll have to invade Alpha Centauri. After that you\'ll battle with\r\nother stars, until you\'ve conquered the cluster, then the galaxy,\r\nfinally the universe. It\'s a very unstable state of affairs.

=== Chunk 12 ===
"\r\n\r\nSlowly Dr. Bruber nodded. "You\'re right. I never realized where science\r\nwas taking us. You have something ready to wipe us out with?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Olbu. "Just beyond the moon, circling the Earth and\r\nthe moon as a satellite, is a missile which I can bring here by\r\ninstantaneous telepathy, as soon as I have my orders from my superior."\r\n\r\n"I trust you\'ll postpone the fateful message until after our telecast?"\r\n\r\nOlbu smiled graciously. "A dying man is usually granted his last\r\nrequest."\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen," said Rodkey, wiping his brow with a damp handkerchief,\r\n"they\'re waiting for us in the next room. We\'re on in a minute." He\r\nopened the door, allowed Olbu to pass through first, and then whispered\r\nto Dr. Bruber. 

=== Chunk 13 ===
"I guess my job doesn\'t matter now. At least we\'ll scoop\r\nthe other networks on the end of the world."\r\n\r\n"Tish, tosh, old man," said Dr. Bruber. "Your job\'s safe and so is the\r\nworld. But if I should resort to murder in the next fifteen minutes, I\r\nhope you\'ll testify in my behalf."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. Bruber walked through the door, tripped over a cable and sprawled\r\nin front of the television cameras. Rodkey helped him to his feet\r\nand steered him to a seat to the left of the distinguished news\r\ncommentator, Cecil Burroughs. On the right of the commentator sat Olbu,\r\nbobbing his huge head and smiling.\r\n\r\nRodkey barely got out of camera range in time to give the signal.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBurroughs gave the commercial, which had nothing to do with\r\ninterplanetary flight, or anything else of interest. "NOW, ladies\r\nand gentlemen," said Burroughs, "our two distinguished scientists\r\nhave a great deal to tell us about two widely separated points in the\r\nuniverse."\r\n\r\nDr. Bruber smiled into the camera. "Just before we went on the air,\r\nMr. Burroughs," he said, "Ambassador Olbu and I had an interesting\r\ndiscussion about the merits of Earth. He contends that it is unstable--"\r\n\r\n"You are twisting my words around, doctor," interpolated Olbu. "I made\r\nit clear that it was not the planet itself, but the people who are\r\nobjectionable."\r\n\r\n"The people spoil the planet?"\r\n\r\n"In a sense. The people are dangerous, the planet is not."\r\n\r\n"Would it be possible for a planet to spoil the people?"\r\n\r\nOlbu seemed to digest the words in his mind before he spoke: "That is\r\na rather weak effort to shift the blame from the shoulders of those\r\nresponsible for a sad state of affairs, doctor. You are trying to say\r\nthere is something in the air, or the water, that makes Earthmen what\r\nthey are."\r\n\r\n"No, I was hinting that there might be something wrong with _your_\r\nplanet, Mr. Olbu."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense! Nothing is wrong with my planet. My people would not be\r\naffected even if the air and water were bad. We, the children of Xvik,\r\nare the highest expression of the human race."\r\n\r\n"It\'s easy to see that," said Dr. 

=== Chunk 14 ===
Bruber. "You were pointing out to\r\nme that Earth\'s pattern of existence doesn\'t offer much hope for the\r\nfuture."\r\n\r\n"That is right," said Olbu. "Earth\'s future is not much to look\r\nforward to."\r\n\r\n"But the planet is worth saving?"\r\n\r\n"Definitely."\r\n\r\n"Yet the people are a part of the planet."\r\n\r\n"You should study logic, Dr. Bruber. You\'re trying to make me say\r\nthings that are not logical."\r\n\r\n"Okay, let\'s forget logic and look at what Earth is likely to do if it\r\nfollows its \'natural\' trend. You say it will destroy itself."\r\n\r\n"If someone else doesn\'t do it first," said Olbu. "It will continue to\r\nhave wars till it exhausts all opportunities for it on the planet. Then\r\nit will war in the skies, with other planets, with other stars, finally\r\nwith other galaxies. Man has a thirst for power, and that thirst is\r\nnever satisfied. On the other hand, knowledge leads to contentment. If\r\nthe Earth should seek knowledge, it would forget war."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps war is necessary for survival," suggested Dr. Bruber.\r\n\r\n"War is seldom fought for survival. It is a result of a struggle for\r\nsupremacy. And, might I ask, supremacy of what? After you\'ve conquered\r\nall the galaxies, what do you have?"\r\n\r\n"Olbu seems to have a point there," said Burroughs. "It is now time for\r\na brief message from our sponsor."\r\n\r\nThe message had nothing to do with war, or knowledge.\r\n\r\n"Now, Olbu," began Burroughs, "we were talking about wars, knowledge,\r\npower and survival. Do you have anything else to add?"\r\n\r\n"Only that Earth has brought this on itself," said Olbu.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t quite understand--" Cecil Burroughs wrinkled his massive brow.\r\n\r\n"What our distinguished visitor is trying to say," said Dr. Bruber, "is\r\nthat a planet is only as stable as its people. And a star system is\r\nonly as stable as its planets. Isn\'t that it, Ambassador?"\r\n\r\n"You have a round-about method of stating nothing at all," said Olbu.\r\n"What I\'m trying to tell you is that sometimes worlds must come to an\r\nend."\r\n\r\n"Exactly," said Dr. 

=== Chunk 15 ===
Bruber. "I\'ve made a study of GC1242 for many years\r\nand I\'m quite familiar with it. This star, as many scientists know,\r\nbecame a super nova about fifteen years ago."\r\n\r\n"What?" Olbu\'s eyes grew less slanting and more round.\r\n\r\n"It was an unstable star," said Dr. Bruber. "The Earth, with all its\r\nfaults, is stable. It may be young, impulsive, inclined to play with\r\nfire--atomic fire no less--but it will grow up some day."\r\n\r\n"My star, my planet--gone?"\r\n\r\n"You haven\'t been in contact with your home base since you arrived?"\r\nDr. Bruber asked.\r\n\r\n"I was not supposed to contact my base," said Olbu, "until--" He\r\nstopped abruptly, and those with him were aware of the fact that he was\r\nusing his mental powers to call his superiors.--The lengthening silence\r\nseemed to give proof to Bruber\'s words.\r\n\r\n"Since you have no world to go to," interrupted the Dr. gently, "I hope\r\nyou\'ll be our guest. Perhaps you can teach us something about space\r\nflight and your mental powers."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes!" said Olbu eagerly. "And if I have by any chance cast\r\nreflections on your planet...."\r\n\r\n"My dear Mr. Olbu, science has never suffered when scientists have\r\ndealt frankly with problems at hand."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid our time is up," put in Cecil Burroughs. "Thank you\r\ngentlemen, and I hope our viewers will tune in again next week when\r\nwe will have two interesting personalities, Sam Katchum, who tames\r\nrattlesnakes, and Joe Wattles, who stuffs cobras. Glad we could be\r\ntogether.

=== Chunk 16 ===
"\r\n\r\nRalph Rodkey shook Dr. Bruber\'s hand as he emerged from the broadcast\r\nroom. "You saved my life; you saved my job!"\r\n\r\n"Think nothing of it, Ralph. It was nothing I wouldn\'t have done for\r\nmyself."\r\n\r\n"But if you hadn\'t known about GC1242 becoming a super nova--"\r\n\r\n"You don\'t think the loss of GC1242 was accidental, do you?"\r\n\r\n"Good Lord, Bruber. 

=== Chunk 17 ===
I don\'t know anything about those things."\r\n\r\n"As our friend Olbu said, Man develops along certain patterns ... first\r\nhis own planet, then neighboring planets, then star systems."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t think--?"\r\n\r\n"I do, Rodkey. I do. Somebody else was just a little more advanced than\r\nGC1242 and did to them what they wanted to do to us."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
