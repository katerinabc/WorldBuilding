Every risk had been\r\n            closely considered. Now Ron Carnavon, ruthless\r\n           convict, was ready to loot the wrecked spaceship\r\n         of its sapphire treasure, and thrust his warped power\r\n            around the entire, antagonistic EMV triangle._\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n                     Planet Stories November 1951.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nRon Carnavon had been the skipper of the late _Thunderbird_, and it\r\nwas common knowledge in every port of the EMV triangle that he had\r\nscuttled her. There was a price on his head, and the High Space Guard\r\nwas combing the spacelanes for him--and for the _Thunderbird_. For the\r\n_Thunderbird_ was a treasure ship.\r\n\r\nBut Carnavon was a cautious man and no fool, for all that he\'d\r\ncommitted barratry. He left the _Thunderbird_ in a Trojan orbit a\r\nmillion miles off Triton, ruptured and spilling corpses into space. He\r\ntook a spaceboat and jetted sunward to the Holcomb Foundation Outpost\r\non Oberon. Then he stowed away on the mail ship to Canalopolis, still\r\ncarrying the chart that showed the _Thunderbird\'s_ position. In the\r\nCanal City, Carnavon evaded the lax Guard cordons and found himself a\r\nrenegade Martian hypnosurgeon to change his face and fingerprints.\r\n\r\nFrom then on it was easy. Across Syrtis Major by sand-ski to Marsport\r\nposing as a prospector. And from Marsport down the Grand Canal to the\r\nspaceman\'s boneyard at Yakki. It was there that he met and hired Pop\r\nWills and the _Carefree_.\r\n\r\nRon Carnavon acted with characteristic caution when he chose Pop and\r\nthe _Carefree_ to do the ghoul work on the ship he had murdered. Pop\'s\r\nship was a rusty bucket, but well enough fixed to reach Triton where\r\nthe _Thunderbird\'s_ corpse orbited, her vault heavy with Plutonian\r\nsapphires. And Pop needed work badly. He was almost too broke to outfit\r\nhis ship for the flight. Carnavon noted with curling lip that most of\r\nPop\'s assets had long ago been liquidated to buy gin. The long years\r\nin space had taken a toll on the old man. Actually a greater toll than\r\neven Carnavon could have imagined.\r\n\r\nPop and the _Carefree_ fitted in with Carnavon\'s plans to perfection.\r\nPop had been in trouble more than once with the High Space Guard. Pop\r\nwas an old soak who wouldn\'t be missed. When something happened to the\r\n_Carefree_, the rest of the beached wrecks in Yakki would only shake\r\ntheir heads and agree that Pop had pushed the old bucket a few Gs too\r\nhard somewhere. That was just the end the wrecker had in mind for Pop\r\nwhen his job was finished, too.\r\n\r\nIt was only reasonable. He couldn\'t let Pop live to tell the Guard that\r\nRon Carnavon had had a hypnosurgical metamorphosis. Even a fortune in\r\nsapphires couldn\'t buy the High Space Guard. It was far too well-heeled\r\nwith Holcomb Foundation money, and it took its duties to the\r\ninhabitants of the Earth-Mars-Venus Triangle seriously. A cautious man\r\nwould realize this and take the proper steps. In this case the proper\r\nsteps would be the elimination of Pop Wills when his job was done.\r\n\r\nBut everyone makes mistakes. Carnavon made one when he selected Pop\r\nand the _Carefree_. With all the rusty hulks dotting the ramps of\r\nYakki, and with all the even rustier skippers there, he should have\r\nhired someone else. Anyone else. Ron Carnavon should have connected\r\nPop Wills with the twelve-year-old cabin boy of the _Thunderbird_. The\r\nyoungster\'s name had been Wills, too. But of course, Carnavon couldn\'t\r\nhave been expected to remember everything. Just coincidence--but those\r\nthings do happen.\r\n\r\nSo these two lifted from Mars together. A captain who had wrecked his\r\nown ship and a gin-soaked old man whose only son had died because\r\nof it. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
And neither knew the other for what he was. To Carnavon, Pop\r\nwas just a fall-guy doing his job in proper sucker fashion. And to\r\nPop Wills, Carnavon was just John Smith who wanted to go to Grid\r\nM332254-89OK off Triton and was willing to pay well for the privilege.\r\n\r\nThe wrecker ordered the course and Pop set it. Mars began to dwindle\r\nand the Belt loomed up ahead. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
The _Carefree_ threaded her way through\r\nthe rocky maze and on past Saturn and Uranus in a free-falling arc. She\r\nwas slow, but in space "slow" is a relative term. The Outer Planets\r\nwere in triple conjunction and with their help, the old boat made time.\r\nCarnavon checked the course daily, and Pop accepted the corrections\r\nwithout protest. After all, John Smith was paying for the trip and he\r\nseemed to know what he was doing. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
No questions asked. Carnavon liked\r\nthat. No questions, no trouble. He couldn\'t have been more wrong.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt\'s hard to say in mere words what old Pop must have felt when he\r\npicked up the wreck of the _Thunderbird_ on the radar. He recognized\r\nthe image, of course. The _Thunderbird_ was unique among spacers. Then\r\nhe checked her position against the chart that Carnavon had marked and\r\nrealized why they had come. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
He realized too who this John Smith was,\r\nand hate pulsed through him in sickening waves. Pop wasn\'t a brave man,\r\nand he was past his prime, but he could still hate.\r\n\r\nAlmost without conscious thought, Pop broke out the Ultra-Wave and\r\nbegan calling the Guard. He broadcast full particulars, co-ordinates,\r\ndescriptions, everything. He was at it when Carnavon found him and sent\r\nhim crashing against the control panels with a smashing overhand right\r\nto the mouth.\r\n\r\nPop sprawled on the metal decking and watched the wrecker carefully\r\nsmash every communicating device on the ship\'s panel. There was a\r\nthrobbing pain in his head where he had struck the shabbily padded\r\ncontrol console, and the thick taste of blood was in his bruised mouth.\r\nHe watched Carnavon like an animal, a hurt, impotently raging beast.\r\nAnd he began to be afraid. Even his hate couldn\'t spare him that, for\r\nPop was afraid to die and he knew just what his chances were now.\r\n\r\nCarnavon, on the other hand, didn\'t waste time hating. He didn\'t know\r\nwhy Pop had called copper, and he didn\'t really care. Pop wasn\'t\r\nimportant. The sapphires in the _Thunderbird\'s_ vault. _They_ were\r\nimportant. He\'d come too far to abandon them now.\r\n\r\nIt would take nine minutes for Pop\'s radio appeal to reach the nearest\r\nGuard base, Carnavon calculated. And it would take six hours for\r\nthe fastest Guard ship to reach them after that. He could board the\r\n_Thunderbird_ and loot her in not more than two hours. That would\r\nstill give the _Carefree_ a four hour start on the Guard, and in deep\r\nspace four hours were as good as four thousand. Carnavon still wasn\'t\r\nworried. The wrecking of the _Thunderbird_ had been the work of months,\r\nand he wasn\'t going to panic now. Ron Carnavon wasn\'t that sort of a\r\ncriminal.\r\n\r\nBlaster in hand, he motioned Pop to his feet. He wondered vaguely just\r\nwhy the old man had taken such a chance. He couldn\'t have any notions\r\nof collecting the reward for Carnavon. The amount was less than the\r\namount he was getting for doing this--Carnavon smiled bleakly--salvage\r\njob. And the old man was a coward. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
He could see it in the trembling of\r\nthe blue-veined hands, in the shifting faintness of the watery blue\r\neyes. The wrecker shrugged aside the thoughts as unimportant and set to\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nWith a blaster in his ribs, Pop Wills did as he was told. He braked the\r\n_Carefree_ to a stop twenty miles from the ruptured hulk of the liner.\r\nThere were beads of sweat standing out on Pop\'s forehead and his hands\r\nshook on the firing console. A thin trickle of dark blood marred his\r\nstubbled chin. His battered lips were unsteady.\r\n\r\nFor a few bad moments, Pop Wills thought Carnavon was going to blast\r\nhim as soon as the _Carefree_ lost way, but then even his gin-soaked\r\nmind began to understand that the end wasn\'t quite yet. Carnavon needed\r\nhelp looting the murdered liner. If he was going to lay his hands on\r\nher valuables before the Guard appeared, he\'d have to get Pop working\r\nwith him. Maybe if Pop had been more of a man he could have stopped\r\nthe wrecker cold right there, but long years of boozing had left Pop\r\nweak. He could hate well enough, but fear conquers even hate. And that\r\nblaster that followed him in every movement made Pop\'s thin blood run\r\ncold. Life--even a life like Pop Wills\'--was better than the black void\r\nof death. Pop was ready to buy a few more minutes of life at almost any\r\nprice, even from the man who had killed his boy. The old man was like a\r\nrusty watch-spring--battered and wound to the utmost limit. And jammed\r\nthere. Frozen by the reality of that ugly blaster and the cold eyes\r\nbehind it, Pop would help Carnavon. He couldn\'t help himself. And his\r\nhate expanded to include his own senile weakness....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Thunderbird_ spun slowly in the light of the faraway sun, the rent\r\nin her hull gaping like a mouthful of jagged teeth. She had been a\r\nbeautiful thing once, but she was ugly now in death. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
She had not died\r\ngracefully. Her back had been broken and her innards scattered. She\r\norbited sullenly, and around her spun the broken fragments of her inner\r\nbody--the bloated, frozen corpses of the men she\'d carried. Against the\r\nbackdrop of the stars and the blaze of the Milky Way, she seemed to be\r\na blot on the heavens. Pop Wills and Ron Carnavon watched her, each of\r\nthem with his own thoughts. Then the wrecker motioned toward the suit\r\nlockers with his blaster.\r\n\r\nIt took a bit of doing to get into his own pressure suit and still keep\r\nthe blaster pointed at Wills, but Carnavon was a large man, and supple,\r\nand he managed it well enough.\r\n\r\nThe _Carefree_ had no escape boat, so there was nothing for it but to\r\nrely on the suit motors to take them across to the _Thunderbird_. It\r\npromised to be slow going, for the suit motors were weak and produced\r\nonly one tenth G of thrust. Almost anything thrown out ahead by a man\r\nin a space-suit was enough to stop him cold. The recoil overcame the\r\nsuit motor with ridiculous ease and though the motor labored mightily,\r\nit would take a long while to reestablish the original direction of\r\nmovement. But Carnavon had an answer for that, too.\r\n\r\nA quick check of the radar showed that there were still no Guard ships\r\nwithin hailing distance. Carnavon\'s original estimate of the time it\r\nwould take the Space Guard to arrive on the scene turned out to be\r\nsurprisingly accurate.\r\n\r\nHe connected his suit to Pop\'s with a short cable and snap-hooks and\r\ntogether they made their way to the _Carefree\'s_ dorsal valve.\r\n\r\nCarnavon had no intention of sweating out a long, slow crossing to\r\nthe hulk, so he ran the lock pressure up high and waited until the\r\nouter hatch was lined up with the derelict liner. Then with a sudden\r\nmovement, he spun the wheel and popped the outer portal. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
Pop and\r\nCarnavon shot into space like grotesque _bolas_. The _Thunderbird_\r\nloomed up ahead.\r\n\r\nPop kept his mouth shut and his eyes open. He saw more than an\r\nold man might be expected to see, too. For instance he saw that\r\nCarnavon--cautious though he might be--had neglected to take an extra\r\nmagazine for his blaster. That meant that there were just three shots\r\nin the weapon. One of which, Pop figured, would be used against the\r\nvault of the scuttled liner. Not that the old man was making any plans.\r\nHe was still too weighted by his fear and his sense of impotence for\r\nthat. He merely noticed, and prayed to the gods of space that one of\r\nthose shots in the blaster might not be meant for him.\r\n\r\nAs they drew near the liner, Pop felt nausea churning his stomach.\r\nThe ship was surrounded by satellites. Space-bloated bodies, naked\r\nand misshapen in the bitter light of the dim sun that reflected off\r\nthe pitted flanks of the burst vessel. Spread-eagled grotesquely,\r\nthe corpses circled their ship, puffy things of horror with staring\r\neyes and extended fingers. Other things, too, circled the hulk.\r\nSmall, commonplace items. A clock, a chair, shattered crockery. Tiny,\r\ninconsequential things, all mutely accusing--all muttering silently\r\nthat their ship had been betrayed by someone who should have protected\r\nher.\r\n\r\nPop glanced over at Carnavon. Through the steelglass bubble of his\r\nhelmet he could see the wrecker\'s face. There was no expression on\r\nit other than concentration--and greed. Pop knew about greed. He\'d\r\nlived with greed and degradation a lot in his last few years. He hated\r\nCarnavon even more now for having reminded him--but he was still too\r\nsick with futility to do more than tell himself that he had done all\r\nhe could do. He _had_ called the Guard, after all. And then, for an\r\nawful moment he found himself regretting that he had done even that and\r\nthereby lost all hope of life....\r\n\r\nTheir magnetic shoes touched the _Thunderbird\'s_ hull with a sound\r\nfaintly carried through the air in their suits. They stood on the\r\ncurving surface, etched in black against the starry sky. A few feet\r\naway from them, the terminator was inching toward them as the derelict\r\nrotated slowly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith Carnavon leading the way, they clumped heavily to the ripped and\r\ntortured hull plates where the _Thunderbird_ had been sundered. By the\r\nlight of their helmet lights Pop could see the thoroughness of the\r\nwrecker\'s work. He had been her captain, this Carnavon, and he had\r\nknown just how to murder her. The outer hull was a shambles and the\r\npressure hull holed in three places. It had been a thorough job. Only\r\none prepared for the sudden horror of her death could have survived it.\r\nPop Wills thought of his boy and sobbed.\r\n\r\nThe dark companionways were empty, blown clean by the violence of the\r\n_Thunderbird\'s_ death. Ron Carnavon led the way down into the ship to\r\nthe purser\'s office and the vault.\r\n\r\nRubble cluttered the small room, bulkheads bent awry and pipes and\r\nwires littered the deck. Carnavon turned Pop loose and set him to\r\nwork cleaning out a path to the vault. Pop\'s breath was coming in\r\nshuddering, grating gasps when he finished the work a half-hour later.\r\nCarnavon nodded approvingly and motioned him away from the vault.\r\n\r\nPop watched while the wrecker braced himself and took careful aim at\r\nthe vault\'s lock mechanism with the blaster. There was a searing flash\r\nof blue flame, and red sparks showered as the oxy-hydrogen bolt sliced\r\ninto the steel of the door. Pop found himself praying fervently that it\r\nwould take two more shots.\r\n\r\nCarnavon fired again, and the tiny room blazed. Pop muttered shakily\r\nunder his breath and waiting for the wrecker to blast just once more.\r\n\r\nThe lock surrendered in a trickle of white-hot slag and Pop felt\r\nhimself sink low. There was still that one shot left for him--and he\r\nwasn\'t needed now.\r\n\r\nThe door swung open and Carnavon knelt to rifle the vault. When he at\r\nlast straightened, he held a pool of jagged blue fire in his gloved\r\nhand. The gems sparkled with a life of their own--two dozen faceted\r\nbeauties--each worth a king\'s ransom--and each bought with a man\'s life.\r\n\r\nPresently they stood again on the outer hull, under an unreal canopy\r\nof stars. Nearby, a ghastly satellite was swinging inward toward the\r\nship. Pop stared at it and back to Carnavon. He began to understand\r\nwhat the wrecker planned. He was going to leave him here--on the wreck.\r\nAnd he would die here. He understood that the shot that remained in the\r\nblaster wasn\'t for him after all. Carnavon wasn\'t going to waste it\r\non him. There was a spanner in the wrecker\'s hand and he now advanced\r\npurposefully toward Pop Wills.\r\n\r\nPop stepped backwards, retreating from the heavy figure of the wrecker.\r\nFear was surging in waves through him--fear mixed with blind hate and\r\ncontempt for himself and his senile weakness. Overhead, against the\r\nstars, the awful satellite drew nearer.\r\n\r\nCarnavon reduced the power in his magnetic shoes and moved lightly\r\ntoward Pop, the spanner raised to strike. The old man stumbled against\r\na long shard of steel on the hull that floated upward at his touch.\r\nFear paralyzed him, and he stood now, waiting for the blow of the\r\nspanner that would smash his helmet and leave him a distended corpse\r\nspinning through space. Above him, the satellite spun inward.\r\n\r\nPop glanced up--into the agonized, dead face of a twelve-year-old boy.\r\nHe shrieked. The sound deafened him in the bubble of his helmet. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
All\r\nthe fear and weakness turned to a bitter hate and surged forward in\r\none insane motion toward his tormentor. The long shard of steel came\r\nto hand like a lance. The rusted, warped old watch spring that was Pop\r\nWills recoiled and unwound in one raging moment. He charged Carnavon.\r\n\r\nCarnavon evaded the clumsy charge instinctively. With an almost\r\nunconscious motion, he raised the blaster and fired point-blank.\r\n\r\nThe searing bolt caught Pop Wills in the chest and spun him around,\r\ntattered ribbons of charred flesh and melted metal from his suit\r\nintermingled. He curled inward upon himself in an awkward graceless\r\nfashion and sank to the hull plates, a nimbus of ice flowing from the\r\ngap in his suit as the water-vapor and blood spurted into the vacuum.\r\nBut there was something strangely like a smile on his face as life left\r\nhim. Pop had conquered his fear at last.\r\n\r\nBut Carnavon, on the other end of the bolt of fire that had ended Pop\r\nWills\' life, spun outward--away from the _Thunderbird_, away from the\r\n_Carefree_, end over end, driven by the fiery recoil of his own weapon.\r\nAt a speed considerably less than the muzzle-velocity of the blast, but\r\nstill much higher than the best speed of the feeble suit motor, Ron\r\nCarnavon spun into space. Out and away, the precious sapphires spilling\r\nout of his hand, glittering in the faint sunlight as they took up their\r\norbits about him like tiny, mocking moonlets....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    UWR MESSAGE PRIORITY AA HIGH SPACE GUARD CORVETTE M-233 TO EMV BASE\r\n    ONE OBERON STOP IN RESPONSE TO ALARM BROADCAST BY RS CAREFREE COMMA\r\n    THIS VESSEL PROCEEDED TO GRID M332254-89OK COMMA LOCATED THERE\r\n    MISSING RS THUNDERBIRD STOP RADAR SEARCH LOCATED MISSING CAPTAIN\r\n    RON CARNAVON WANTED FOR MURDER AND BARRATRY STOP CARNAVON\r\n    UNACCOUNTABLY FOUND AT CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM VESSEL DEAD OF\r\n    ASPHYXIATION DUE TO EXHAUSTION OF PRESSURE SUIT SUPPLIES STOP CASE\r\n    MAY BE CONSIDERED CLOSED STOP END MESSAGE\r\n\r\n    QUINBY CORVETTE M-233\r\n\r\n    COMMANDER HSG\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
