]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rocket waited, a gleaming yellow-finned tube, pointing its nose at\r\nthe depths of space. Time ticked in the control tower which rested in\r\nthe shadow of the great monster. Six minutes left. Sunlight danced on\r\nsilver curves.\r\n\r\nTick, tick, tick, tick. The time was in Charters\' brain like the sound\r\nof a pendulum in a grandfather\'s clock. The end was nearing.\r\n\r\nIt was almost over.\r\n\r\nCharters turned his thick wrist and looked at his watch.\r\n\r\nOutside the sun was a strong white fire in a blue sky. Sand stretched\r\naway endlessly from the circular cluster of buildings, from which the\r\nrocket had been conceived and nurtured and born.\r\n\r\nSeconds crept, and there was a dead silence in the tower room.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve done it," Charters said, his voice like a snapping of brittle\r\nwires.\r\n\r\nLampson, his assistant, nodded and watched the rocket. "Yes," he said.\r\n\r\n"Greatest victory of the age!" said Charters, grinning and gaily wiping\r\nhis hands together.\r\n\r\nLampson watched the way the sun struck the glistening silver body of\r\nthe rocket.\r\n\r\n"Have you nothing to say, man?" Charters asked.\r\n\r\n"I was just thinking."\r\n\r\n"This is no time to think," Charters said, his eyes bright and winking.\r\n"This is a time to let your thoughts drain out of your head. To feel\r\nthe damned meaning of this thing! 

=== Chunk 3 ===
To let it get inside you and fill you\r\nup to the brains! This is the time to laugh and cry, Lampson. To let\r\nyour insides quiver with the pure joy of it! We\'ve done it!"\r\n\r\n"Yes," Lampson said. "Only I was thinking about Randall, sitting out\r\nthere, waiting."\r\n\r\n"He\'ll be all right."\r\n\r\n"I know he will. I don\'t mean that. I mean, the way he feels about\r\nthings, yet sitting there, waiting to guide it to the Moon, to prove\r\nits reality. And all the time, he--"\r\n\r\n"He\'s caught in a stream, Lampson. A swift, driving stream that won\'t\r\nlet him stop. He can\'t help himself."\r\n\r\nLampson shook his head. "I can\'t believe he\'s really going through with\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"He\'s different now," Charters said. "A few months ago, he had all\r\nthese ideas about the rocket being used for military reasons, for\r\nkilling, and all that other nonsense. Now he\'s caught in the grip\r\nof this thing. He\'s watched his own work blossom and turn into a\r\nremarkably beautiful finished miracle."\r\n\r\nCharters watched the rocket, eyes half-closed, seeming to feel the\r\nstrength of it in his own hands as he closed them slowly, tightly.\r\n\r\n"Ah--" he said, lips curling. "The beautiful, beautiful thing!"\r\n\r\nLampson watched through the thick window, unblinking. "He was right,\r\nyou know."\r\n\r\n"Who was right?"\r\n\r\n"Randall. He was right about this rocket. We won\'t use it for anything\r\nbut just another weapon. All this work and planning. All Randall\'s\r\nsweat and blood. For no reason, but just another weapon."\r\n\r\n"It\'s too late now."\r\n\r\n"Yes. And you knew it, didn\'t you?" Lampson said to Charters, looking\r\nat the man. "You knew what this would mean. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
When Randall wanted to\r\nquit, and you finally got him to go ahead, you knew what we\'d use it\r\nfor."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t quit after ten years." Charters looked at his watch,\r\ncounting silently.\r\n\r\n"He\'s been sold out," Lampson said, thinking of Randall, sitting in the\r\nrocket. "A lifetime of worry and work and prayer. Now he\'s been sold\r\nout."\r\n\r\n"Damn it, man," Charters said, "it\'s nearly ready to happen!"\r\n\r\nThe room was silent, and the ticking was in the air again. A steady,\r\nrhythmic ticking, that got into the brain and beat time with the heart.\r\n\r\nOne minute.\r\n\r\nThe rocket rested on its launch, as though tightening its metallic\r\nmuscles and cords, to spring into the air like a wild frenzied terror,\r\nto cut through the sky, through space, to touch the Moon.\r\n\r\n"Thirty seconds," Charters said, his voice trembling.\r\n\r\nLampson closed his hands and his eyes.\r\n\r\n"Twenty seconds." Charters bent his head over his watch. His breathing\r\nshortened and he waited, tensed, crouched. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
"Ten. Five, four, three,\r\ntwo..."\r\n\r\nThe ground shook as though a chasm had split beneath its surface! There\r\nwas a streaking in the air. The rocket sped away and away.\r\n\r\n"Over!" said Charters, his face to the sky. "It\'s over!"\r\n\r\nLampson turned from the window and stood quietly, watching the floor.\r\nHis shoulders were limp, his hands still and quiet at his sides.\r\n\r\n"By God!" said Charters, whirling, slapping his palms together. "What\r\nan entirely immense thing!" He grinned widely and moved his feet as\r\nthough he were dancing.\r\n\r\n"Randall," said Lampson, his voice a lost, dead sound.\r\n\r\n"Randall, Randall," Charters mimicked. He moved about quickly, this\r\nway and that, waving his hands, grinning. "This is much greater than\r\nRandall!"\r\n\r\nLampson was silent while Charters cracked his hands together. "The\r\nMoon," Charters breathed. "The Moon!"\r\n\r\nThere was a loud shuffling outside the door then, and suddenly the door\r\nswung open and a wide-eyed man in the white coveralls stood, staring at\r\nCharters.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter?" said Charters, freezing.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t believe it," said the man. "I really can\'t believe it!"\r\n\r\n"What, man?" said Charters, moving toward the door.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Randall. He just climbed out of the rocket and walked away. Six\r\nseconds before it went up."\r\n\r\nCharters stopped, staring with wild eyes. His face colored. Rage choked\r\nhis voice.\r\n\r\n"WHY?" barked the man.\r\n\r\nLampson stood at the window, his eyes lighting. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
He smiled, then\r\nlaughed. And far away, a gleaming yellow-finned rocket drove up, up,\r\nfinding the path through space that would carry it, alone, past the\r\nMoon, to the Sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
