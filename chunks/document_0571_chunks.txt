B. FYFE\r\n\r\n               The problem was simple--or rather, simply\r\n              stated: Zoya Lar-Tul must keep those nasty,\r\n                   aggressive little _Earthmen_ from\r\n             discovering the location of his home-star....\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n                       Planet Stories May 1951.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Ullo Dah-Gow waddled into the section communications chamber on\r\nYaradir, second planet of Zillor, two of his four walking tentacles\r\nstuck slightly on a nearly dry spot.\r\n\r\n"Fire and dry sand!" he swore at the technicians. "Can\'t you two even\r\nkeep the footing decently moist?"\r\n\r\nWithout waiting for an answer, he made his way to the row of shallow\r\nmud tubs before the television screen. The operators aimed eyestalks\r\nat each other. Finally, Yado Nol-Moz, as junior, rose and went to the\r\nwall controls of the conditioner.\r\n\r\nThe assistant supervisor was relieved to see a thin sheet of water\r\ncreep across the floor. He never knew when Yado or Viri Nol-Rin might\r\nchoose to ignore him.\r\n\r\n_Which comes of old Ahnu loading this section with his nephews_, he\r\nthought bitterly, forgetting that in his own office he already had\r\na list of his own relatives prepared against the day when he should\r\nsucceed to the post of Supervisor of Colonial Scouting for Sector 63.\r\n\r\nThe slap-slap of tentacles in the corridor announced the arrival of\r\nhis superior. Ahnu Nol-Yev entered and lowered his thick body into the\r\nchoicest of the mud tubs, which Ullo had prudently left free.\r\n\r\n"Now, what\'s this urgent message?" he demanded, pointing one eyestalk\r\nat Ullo and fixing the other upon the screen above Viri\'s broad, bony\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n"A request for orders from scout Zoya Lar-Tul," answered Viri.\r\n"Assigned to ... let me see ... system LL-255-13."\r\n\r\n"Did we have any report on that system?" asked Ahnu.\r\n\r\nYado produced the tape of a preliminary report and placed it on the\r\nspeaker. The list of facts rolled out: number of planets ... number\r\nwith sufficient water for colonization ... number of intelligent\r\nspecies--one, on third planet ... native nomenclature--star, _Sol_; own\r\nplanet, _Earth_; others ... and so on.\r\n\r\n"All right," wheezed Ahnu. "I remember now. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
Get hold\r\nof ... whatsisname ... Zoya!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nViri manipulated his keys and knobs. The brief delay before an\r\nanswering image appeared on the screen irritated Ahnu. The loose,\r\ncoppery scales around his thick neck glinted with iridescent highlights\r\nas he puffed out his air-sacs.\r\n\r\n"Dessication!" he snarled. "We bridge all those light-years with\r\nsubspace waves for his benefit, and he can\'t be alert enough to--Got\r\nhim now, Viri?"\r\n\r\nThe technician snapped the tip of a gripping tentacle in assent.\r\nAnother Yaradirian looked out at them from the screen.\r\n\r\nThis one had obviously been roughing it; his scales were lubricated by\r\nonly a minimum film of moisture, and he wore space harness on the lower\r\npart of his body.\r\n\r\n_To keep his walking tentacles wet_, Ullo realized. _He hasn\'t so much\r\nas a drop of water on the floor of that dive!_\r\n\r\n"Zoya Lar-Tul!" announced Viri.\r\n\r\n"Stated simply," said Ahnu bluntly, "what is your trouble?"\r\n\r\n"Stated simply, Great One," answered the scout, "I am in imminent\r\ndanger of detection by natives of this system."\r\n\r\nUllo stiffened in his mud tub. He heard the _slurp_ as the Supervisor\r\nsplashed more mud upon the oozing floor.\r\n\r\n"How is that?" demanded Ahnu, his throat again beginning to expand\r\nmajestically.\r\n\r\n"I fail to see," replied Zoya, "in what manner I could have avoided\r\nit, Great One. The natives, _Earthmen_ in their own speech, have just\r\ndiscovered an inefficient form of our own interstellar subspace drive.\r\nThey have gone exploring."\r\n\r\n_Might have known it_, thought Ullo. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
_Just when I\'m working up to a top\r\nrank, too!_\r\n\r\nIt sounded bad. Should they be unable to think Zoya out of his\r\npredicament, it might well mean new personnel all around. Ullo\'s only\r\nsatisfaction was that Ahnu\'s relatives would be discharged before his\r\nown resignation was given him to sign.\r\n\r\nAhnu controlled himself.\r\n\r\n"Give me a picture of your situation!" he commanded.\r\n\r\n"To begin with, Great One, I chose to study the natives from a\r\ndistance, as is usual. I left my subspace ship on the largest satellite\r\nof their sixth planet, which has several other moons and a beautiful\r\nset of rings that--"\r\n\r\n"Kindly touch bottom!" Ahnu cut him off. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
"I am not interested in a\r\nlocal travelogue!"\r\n\r\n"Even so, Great One. With my short-range rocket, I then established\r\nthis base on the seventh moon of their fifth planet. Only this moon\'s\r\nsmallness and insignificance has so far prevented by discovery."\r\n\r\nThey listened to the rest of the story in an uncomfortable silence that\r\nwas broken only by an occasional squishing of mud as one or another\r\nstirred uneasily.\r\n\r\nZoya Lar-Tul had observed the _Earthmen_, as well as other bodies in\r\nthe system, for a quarter-revolution of his chosen fifth planet. At the\r\ntime of his arrival, the natives had reached their own satellite, but\r\nhe judged that they would be long in organizing successful flights to\r\nthe planets.\r\n\r\n"I translated some of their broadcasts and learned that this was their\r\ngreat current project. Naturally, however, I was unconcerned, and\r\ncontented myself with obtaining specimens for my researches by brief,\r\ndiscreet trips here and there."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUllo snapped his tentacle tip quietly in assent. He remembered from\r\nhis history the dreadfully long period of his own race\'s expansion\r\nthroughout the system of Zillor. These _Earthmen_, however, seemed from\r\nZoya\'s report to possess certain advantages. Their requirements of air\r\nand water were moderate and more easily stored in a space vessel. If\r\nthey _had_ discovered a form of subspace drive, they might be energetic\r\nenough to pop up in the vicinity of Zillor some fine day.\r\n\r\n"You will imagine my amazement," continued Zoya, "when I heard one of\r\ntheir broadcasts announce that a ship had reached their fourth planet,\r\nand another the second--"\r\n\r\nAhnu blew out a long, bubbling breath.\r\n\r\n"All this is doubtless interesting," he snorted, "but what is the\r\nimmediate emergency?"\r\n\r\nThe image of Zoya aimed both eyestalks rather deliberately at the\r\nSupervisor.\r\n\r\n"They reached and passed this group of satellites," he hissed out. "Do\r\nI make clear my dilemma, Great One?"\r\n\r\nHe waited while Ahnu\'s neck swelled dangerously. Just before the\r\nexplosion, he continued:\r\n\r\n"Should they discover me, they will also find the specimens I have\r\ncollected, except the choicer ones stored on my subspace vessel for\r\ntransport home. This is what I mean--"\r\n\r\nZoya reached out to touch a button, and the scene changed to what was\r\nevidently the dissecting laboratory of his base. Behind a transparent\r\nbulkhead hung several sorts of carcasses in various stages of\r\ndismemberment. Ullo suspected that the storeroom was simply left at the\r\ntemperature of the moon\'s surface.\r\n\r\n"Very well!" exclaimed Ahnu as the scout reappeared. "You seem to be\r\noperating a sort of butcher shop with some of the most ugly specimens\r\never seen. What about it?"\r\n\r\nUllo felt sorry for the scout. Even he--indeed, as he saw by the twitch\r\nof their eyestalks, even the technicians--had realized the problem.\r\nZoya patiently explained, forbearing to mention that his instructions\r\nwere laid out by Ahnu.\r\n\r\n"If you will refer to descriptions in my preliminary report, Great One,\r\nyou will see that certain of the specimens are _Earthmen_ themselves.\r\nShould their explorers discover them, I have reason to believe they\r\nwould be resentful. It is my opinion that they are a belligerent race."\r\n\r\nAhnu was silent for a moment.\r\n\r\n"Well ... yes ... that is possible," he admitted.\r\n\r\n"It would appear," he continued in another moment, "that you must\r\neither abandon your base or dispose of your specimens if, as you say,\r\nthe _Earthmen_ have so soon reached your vicinity."\r\n\r\nZoya waited. Ullo stirred in his tub.\r\n\r\n"If I may suggest, Great One--?"\r\n\r\n"Yes?"\r\n\r\n"I believe he should destroy his subspace ship!"\r\n\r\n"_What!_"\r\n\r\n"I am inclined to agree," Zoya Lar-Tul put in.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmazed, Ahnu waited for Ullo\'s reasons. Encouraged by such\r\nconsideration, the latter went on.\r\n\r\n"If these _Earthmen_ are already on their way to the ringed planet,\r\nthey will undoubtedly stop first at the largest moon--where Zoya has\r\nleft his main ship."\r\n\r\n"And will likely discover it there," Ahnu agreed reluctantly.\r\n\r\n"And from that point," continued Ullo, "they will discover both our\r\nlocation in space and the interstellar subspace drive in its finished\r\nform. After that, they can get at _us_!"\r\n\r\n"The opposite extreme of my dilemma," confirmed Zoya.\r\n\r\n"Silence!" ordered Ahnu. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
"Let me think!"\r\n\r\nAll of them--Supervisor, assistant, technicians, and the image on the\r\nscreen--considered the situation gloomily. The government of Yaradir\r\nwould take a dry view of having to combat an invasion, should one\r\ndevelop from this. The race of Yaradir, because of their personal\r\nrequirements and life conditions, were not as numerous as most of\r\nthe races they had found in their explorations. The great distances\r\nbetween their colonies and the growing number of these were due to the\r\ncomparative rarity of the type of planet that suited them.\r\n\r\n"Can you reach the ship in your local rocket in time to escape in\r\nit?" asked Ahnu. "After all, subspace ships are costly; if we leave a\r\ndeserted base, what can they find out?"\r\n\r\n"It is possible," admitted Zoya doubtfully, "but risky."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"They may intercept me on the way, for their ships are faster than my\r\nrocket. They may even catch the big ship before I gain enough speed to\r\nshift into subspace drive."\r\n\r\n"For all we know," interrupted Ullo, forgetting his place, "they may be\r\nable to keep up with you even then."\r\n\r\nAhnu bubbled angrily at the idea, but they all were silent for another\r\nunhappy period of cogitation.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps," admitted Ahnu in the end, "you will have to destroy the\r\nsubspace ship, but only in the last extremity!"\r\n\r\n"I could blow it up from space, if I get within range."\r\n\r\n"Not so fast; that ship is a major item in the budget!" Ahnu told him\r\nangrily. "The first thing is to try to get aboard unseen and return to\r\npick up what you can from your base."\r\n\r\n"And if these _Earthmen_ are nearby?" Ullo asked.\r\n\r\n"Then Zoya must forget the base and escape with the ship, which is the\r\nmain thing."\r\n\r\n"But if they have already found it?" inquired Zoya.\r\n\r\n"All right, all right! _Then_ destroy it! And you had better\r\nstart immediately unless you wish to find such action necessary.\r\nSomehow,"--here one eyestalk was deflected rather pointedly toward\r\nUllo--"somehow, too many mouths always speed up the clocks."\r\n\r\nUllo did a little neck-swelling himself at this example of bias.\r\n\r\n_Just because he couldn\'t get my job for his youngest brother_, he\r\nthought resentfully. _Serve him right if I\'d resigned! Where\'d he be if\r\nI didn\'t stick here to push his snout into the obvious every time he\r\nslides over it?_\r\n\r\n"Yes," repeated Ahnu, complacent at having found his solution, "that is\r\nwhat you must do. If anything goes wrong, you can still use your rocket\r\nto return to your base."\r\n\r\n"Which I hope," sighed Zoya, "to find undisturbed."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt that, Ahnu fell silent. After a tense moment, he heaved himself\r\naround to direct both eyestalks at Ullo.\r\n\r\n"Well?" he wheezed. "Have you no suggestions in case he does have to\r\ndestroy the subspace ship?"\r\n\r\nUllo twirled one tentacle tip in the mud of his tub until he collected\r\na sticky blob. This he flipped away with a snap of the tentacle. He\r\nderived a slight satisfaction from the _splat_ against the far wall.\r\n\r\n"We must try to preserve _one_ of his collections of information," he\r\nsaid. "It would entail considerable expense--not to mention time--to\r\nreplace Zoya and repeat the scouting."\r\n\r\nAhnu shifted his position irritably. Ullo saw that his reference to\r\nexpense had been a shrewd blow. The Supervisor snorted and bubbled, but\r\nfinally conceded that much and gestured for Ullo to continue.\r\n\r\n"So it would be unfortunate if he should succeed in regaining his big\r\nship, only to return to his base and find it occupied by exploring\r\n_Earthmen_."\r\n\r\n"What do you suggest, then?"\r\n\r\n"He should try for _either_ the base or the ship, and arrange to\r\ndestroy the other! If he can remain undetected for a short time at the\r\nbase, he can dispose of his specimens after forwarding a report on\r\nthem. If he gets to the ship safely, why leave behind any clues at all?"\r\n\r\nAfter considerable wheezing and puffing, it was agreed that Zoya should\r\ntake a chance on having his base discovered while he was away, but\r\nprovide for the eventuality by arranging a bomb that would be set off\r\nby the approach of any strange ship. He admitted that he already had\r\none, keyed to be safe only after certain signals from his own rocket.\r\nHe had only to hook it up.\r\n\r\n"If you do have to return," advised Ullo, "clean out your dissecting\r\nroom and then make friends with the _Earthmen_. Give them some story of\r\nbeing cast away, and ask help in building a new ship."\r\n\r\n"You mean ... install our kind of drive without their knowing?"\r\n\r\n"Exactly!" said Ahnu, taking to the idea. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
"Then just drop out of sight\r\nsome fine day and leave them wondering which way you went."\r\n\r\nAt this point, Viri made bold to request that Zoya leave the televisor\r\nat the base operating, with a continuous view of the main chamber as\r\nnow shown. He began to explain that he wanted to be sure not to lose\r\ncontact, but Ahnu had heard enough. He cut Viri short by climbing out\r\nof his mud tub.\r\n\r\n"That settles it then," he summed up to Zoya. "If you _are_ forced to\r\ndestroy the subspace ship, report from the base when you return and are\r\nready to contact the natives. Otherwise, report from the ship!"\r\n\r\nHe waddled out of the communications chamber without ceremony, followed\r\nby Ullo Dah-Gow.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next day, the latter was kept busy with the many reports of arid\r\nplanets he had to file in order to justify the expenses of exploration.\r\n\r\n_He always leaves explaining the budget to me_, he thought.\r\n\r\nHe did, however, snatch time to put a copy tape of the last installment\r\nof Zoya\'s preliminary report on the speaker, having felt ill at\r\nease for not being completely up to date at the previous evening\'s\r\nconference.\r\n\r\nHalfway through a listing of sociological and psychological\r\nobservations, Ullo stiffened. He ran the tape through again.\r\n\r\n"He\'d _better_ get to that ship!" he wheezed to himself. "They sound\r\nlike a nest of trouble-makers--resourceful, aggressive, just the sort\r\nto burst into this system some sweet day and tell us Yaradir is _their_\r\ncolony!"\r\n\r\nHe ripped the tape out of the speaker and hurried along a dank corridor\r\nto Ahnu\'s office, not even pausing at his favorite spots to rub against\r\nthe cool, dripping walls. He found his chief relaxing in an adjoining\r\nchamber by submitting to a massage.\r\n\r\n"Not now!" complained Ahnu at the first mention of _Earthmen_. "Wait\r\ntill we hear from Zoya. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
I want to enjoy having my scales oiled in\r\npeace!"\r\n\r\nUllo spitefully dropped the tape into a pot of scale-grease on the way\r\nout, but dutifully returned to his work.\r\n\r\nLate one night, however, he was reminded of the scout in system\r\nLL-255-13. The emergency buzzer beside his sleeping pool awoke him with\r\nan urgent summons. The number on the screen beside it indicated the\r\ncommunications chamber now reserved for Zoya Lar-Tul.\r\n\r\nStill dripping, Ullo pumped down the corridor, encountering his chief\r\nat the last turn. Ahnu was irritated.\r\n\r\n"What can they have spoiled now?" he demanded, as if he suspected Ullo\r\nof having had a tentacle in it. "It was a perfectly simple arrangement!"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps something unexpected came up," suggested Ullo.\r\n\r\n"What could be unexpected? It was utterly simple!" 

=== Chunk 8 ===
said Ahnu\r\nexplosively. "If he beats them to it, he reports from the ship.\r\nOtherwise he destroys it and goes back to report from his base!"\r\n\r\nHe slap-slapped irately into their destination, wondering audibly why\r\nhe had to come down here and direct people\'s eyestalks for them.\r\n\r\n"Because, Great One," replied Viri Nol-Rin, a trifle more abruptly than\r\nwas consistent with proper respect for Ahnu\'s position, "the televisor\r\nat Zoya\'s base has gone dead!"\r\n\r\n"What? Why? If you can\'t keep in communication--"\r\n\r\n"There _isn\'t_ any communication," interrupted Viri.\r\n\r\nUllo saw that the operator was deeply disturbed. To\r\ninterrupt--_actually interrupt_--Ahnu Nol-Yev! Even if one was his\r\nnephew!\r\n\r\n"That is why, if you will remember," Viri went on, "I insisted Zoya\r\nleave his signal in operation. The chance that his base would be\r\napproached by a strange ship sooner than we hoped, and blow up."\r\n\r\n"So the bomb went off?" said Ullo.\r\n\r\n"It must have. And, by the figures Zoya gave me before he left, he is\r\nlong, long overdue at the subspace ship."\r\n\r\n"Well, what of it?" 

=== Chunk 9 ===
demanded Ahnu. "It merely means he will have to\r\nreport from the ship when he ... if he ... if _they_ don\'t--"\r\n\r\nHe snorted and wheezed into silence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUllo traded stares with Viri. Then he looked at Yado, who wore an\r\nequally unhappy expression on his wide visage.\r\n\r\n"Are you _sure_ he would have reached the ship before now?" Ahnu\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\n"Completely."\r\n\r\nThe Supervisor swore feelingly, using some of the bleakest and driest\r\nterms Ullo had ever heard. The gist of the diatribe was the delay and\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\n"Now it may be yaras before we get his data!"\r\n\r\n"How do you mean?" 

=== Chunk 10 ===
asked Ullo.\r\n\r\n"It\'s obvious, isn\'t it? He must have had to destroy the ship; but\r\nbefore he got back, some prowling _Earthmen_ set off the charge at\r\nhis base. That leaves him with only his rocket. Don\'t you see what it\r\nmeans?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps not," said Ullo.\r\n\r\n"Why, he\'ll have to make friends with those _things_ from _Earth_, and\r\nget help building a new ship. Until then, we\'ll have to classify his\r\nreport \'pending.\'"\r\n\r\nHe sloshed watery mud about as he heaved himself from his tub\r\nimpatiently. Ullo aimed an eyestalk at each of the technicians,\r\nkeeping them silent until Ahnu had waddled indignantly from the room.\r\n\r\n"I _knew_ we didn\'t cover all the alternatives that night!" said Ullo\r\nfeelingly. "How could we be so dry inside the skull? How _could_ we?"\r\n\r\n"He certainly doesn\'t like the delay," commented Yado.\r\n\r\n"Delay!" snorted Ullo. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
Then he asked, "Is that what it means to you,\r\ntoo?"\r\n\r\nViri and Yado fidgeted under his stare.\r\n\r\n"I keep wondering if Zoya reached the ship," said Ullo.\r\n\r\nThey stared at him.\r\n\r\n"Say it this way, then: \'If _Zoya_ reached the ship?\'"\r\n\r\nViri sighed.\r\n\r\n"I suppose we may never find out what really happened," he said.\r\n\r\n"I believe I would really rather _not_," Ullo told them, preparing to\r\nleave. "Listen in to a complete copy of the preliminary report Zoya\r\nsent, and you will see what I mean."\r\n\r\nHis scales were too dry and needed an oiling, he told himself; but he\r\nknew it was more than that which sent the shudder through him. And\r\nthere were _billions_ of them!\r\n\r\n"What shall we do?" asked Viri.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what good it will do," said Ullo, pausing in the doorway,\r\n"but you might make your wills. Personally, I intend to apply for\r\ntransfer to some colony lying in the opposite direction from this\r\n_Sol_. Record of us, and a ship to reach us--we might as well have sent\r\nthem an invitation!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe remembered their unhappy eyes two yaras later, when the regular\r\nbulletin tapes sent out to the colonies reported Ahnu\'s dismissal. Ullo\r\napplied for a post at a more distant colony.\r\n\r\nAfter one yara at the new post, the monthly tapes from Yaradir were\r\ninterrupted. Everybody complained about the service.\r\n\r\nEverybody but Ullo.\r\n\r\nHe commandeered a subspace ship, and moved on.\r\n\r\nBut not ... far ... enough....\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
