It was much too big and complicated to have been hidden anywhere,\r\nand it hadn\'t any wheels, tracks, wings, or other visible means of\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nCorrigan, looking the object over, decided that it could not have\r\ncome from any logical place in the world. Not being prejudiced, he\r\nthen thought a little about the illogical places, and the places that\r\nweren\'t in the world. Corrigan decided that it must be another attempt\r\nat time travel, and he clucked his tongue sympathetically.\r\n\r\nWell, someone had to break the news. Corrigan arose from the grass and\r\nwalked toward the object.\r\n\r\nThere was a young man sitting in the object, on a sort of high\r\nsaddle. He looked a little wild-eyed, and he seemed to be talking to\r\nhimself, as he pulled and twisted at the rows of controls in front of\r\nhim. Corrigan, looking up at him, decided that he couldn\'t be very\r\nhealthy, and that the stiff gray garments he wore must be extremely\r\nuncomfortable.\r\n\r\n"Greetings, traveler," Corrigan called.\r\n\r\n"You\'re speaking Anglish!" the young man exclaimed.

"Good! 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Maybe I can\r\nget some help here. What year is this?"\r\n\r\n"1955, by most systems."\r\n\r\nThe young man turned a little paler.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve just left 1955," he said unhappily. "Four times, in fact. Four\r\ndifferent 1955\'s. And each one\'s a bit worse. Now the machine won\'t\r\nwork."\r\n\r\n"Your theory\'s wrong," Corrigan said calmly. "Hasn\'t it occurred to you\r\nyet that time travel might be impossible?"\r\n\r\nThe young man made a choked sound. He began to climb down from his\r\nperch, keeping his eyes fixed suspiciously on Corrigan as he did so.\r\nHe saw Corrigan as a small brown man, dressed in loose blue trousers,\r\nbarefooted, and with a puff of white hair that seemed never to\r\nhave been properly cut. The lawns and grassy roads, the bright and\r\nimpermanent-looking buildings, and Corrigan himself, all added up to\r\none thing in the young man\'s mind.\r\n\r\n"You\'re wrong," Corrigan said. "I\'m not a lunatic, and this isn\'t an\r\nasylum. We don\'t have them."\r\n\r\nThe young man, on the ground now, stared at Corrigan in evident horror.\r\n\r\n"Mind reading?"\r\n\r\n"More or less," Corrigan said. "It saves time. For instance, you\'re\r\nDarwin Lenner, and you\'d like very much to get back to wherever you\r\nstarted from. In fact, you have to, or something unpleasant might\r\nhappen to you, by your standards."\r\n\r\n"I\'d be absent without permission," Lenner admitted. "I ... I wish you\r\nwouldn\'t do that."\r\n\r\n"Only when absolutely necessary," Corrigan smiled. "I\'m a philosopher\r\nby trade, myself, not a mind reader. My name\'s Philip Corrigan, and\r\nI\'d be very glad to help you on your way ... but I think it might be a\r\nlittle difficult. We aren\'t really a very mechanically-minded people\r\nhere."\r\n\r\nLenner ran his hands through his hair. "I\'ve _got_ to get back. Isn\'t\r\nthere anybody who knows something about time machines?"\r\n\r\nCorrigan had been thinking swiftly. He had also been carrying on a\r\nconversation which Lenner could not possibly hear, with a man who was\r\nseveral miles away.\r\n\r\n"_Burwell, he wants to go home._"\r\n\r\n"_Fine. He ought to. Why doesn\'t he?_"\r\n\r\n"_He lost his confidence. He thinks his machine\'s broken down._"\r\n\r\n"_That kind, eh? I suppose the thing never really did work very well._"\r\n\r\n"_Most of them don\'t. They go traveling around hit-or-miss through\r\nprobability under the operator\'s own mental steam--but this fellow\r\nprobably comes from a world where an idea like that\'s illegal._"\r\n\r\n"_Sounds like it. Corrigan, take him on a guided tour or something, and\r\nkeep him busy. I\'ll be over as soon as I can. I\'m going to do something\r\nfor his self-confidence. Here\'s the story to give him...._"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCorrigan had always enjoyed conducting guided tours, and he was\r\nenjoying this one especially well. He had a slightly wicked taste for\r\ncomplicated teasing, and Lenner was a perfect object. He had evidently\r\ncome from one of the more unpleasant probabilities, a world full of\r\ncomplex rules and harshly restrictive; everything that he saw bothered\r\nhim. The handsome girls, wearing unstrategically placed flowers and\r\nvery little else; the flocks of children, as plentiful as pigeons and\r\napparently as free of supervision; the almost total absence of anybody\r\nactually performing useful work ... all of it contributed to Lenner\'s\r\nincreasing nervousness.\r\n\r\nThe guided tour went in a wide circle, and Lenner and Corrigan wound up\r\nsitting in a tavern facing on Main Way. Lenner ignored the green drink\r\nbefore him and peered unhappily out the big window toward his machine.\r\n\r\n"Where _is_ that friend of yours?" he asked, for the fifth time.\r\n\r\n"He\'ll be here," Corrigan assured him. "Why hurry? 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Don\'t you like it\r\nhere?"\r\n\r\nLenner\'s mouth hardened. He looked around him, and shook his head.\r\n\r\n"No." He spoke almost apologetically, "I\'m sorry ... well, look, old\r\nfellow, no hard feelings, I hope. But this world of yours is primitive.\r\nDegenerate, I\'d say."\r\n\r\n"Primitive?"\r\n\r\n"No laws--not even morals! Those girls ... and of course, you don\'t\r\nhave any civilized advantages. Not even ground transportation. That\r\nman you spoke of has to _walk_ here. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
And that\'s something else I don\'t\r\nunderstand. You say he\'s another time traveler...."\r\n\r\n"Probability traveler, actually," Corrigan corrected.\r\n\r\n"All right, probability. Why does he stay here? Why would a really\r\nintelligent man give up civilization?"\r\n\r\n"Well, you know how it is. He\'s gone native, you might say. Life among\r\nthe lotus eaters, and all that. Might happen to anybody, even yourself."\r\n\r\nLenner shuddered.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all right, though." Corrigan continued. "He\'ll be here any\r\nminute, and I\'m sure he\'ll be able to help. Knows all there is to know\r\nabout these machines. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
In fact, here he comes now."\r\n\r\nBurwell entered, and Corrigan could hardly suppress a small chuckle.\r\nBurwell had picked up Lenner\'s ideas about what a man of intelligence\r\nand authority ought to look like, and had gone to some trouble to look\r\nthe part. He was wearing a uniform of some sort, spectacles, and an\r\nexpression of extreme wisdom.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure I can repair what\'s wrong," Burwell told Lenner. "Let\'s go\r\nand look at your machine."\r\n\r\nArriving, Burwell climbed over the mechanism with an air of bored\r\nability, occasionally thumping at something, adjusting something else,\r\nor hitting a part with a tool until it rang. He muttered to himself\r\nas he worked, allowing the sound of his musings to drift in Lenner\'s\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n"Umm ... badly twisted impeller ... the varish is more or less\r\nwaffled ... let\'s see if ... ah, there we are."\r\n\r\nHe climbed down and solemnly shook hands with Lenner.\r\n\r\n"Fine machine you\'ve got there, my boy. It\'ll take you back to your\r\nown place quite easily now. There wasn\'t a thing wrong except the drift\r\ncrotch. However, I wouldn\'t use it again if I were you. There\'s no real\r\ncontrol on these things. A man could end up anywhere. And of course,\r\nyou\'d never find your way back here, without control."\r\n\r\n"Well, thanks..." Lenner said doubtfully. He glanced around. "It\'s a\r\nshame there\'s no way we could regularly communicate between our worlds.\r\nThere\'s a lot we could do for this one."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure of that," Burwell said, hastily looking away. "But it isn\'t\r\nworth the danger and difficulty of reaching us. For myself, it doesn\'t\r\nmatter any more." He assumed a nobly tragic expression. "But you are\r\nyoung; you\'ve got your life ahead of you; your State and your society\r\nneed you. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
I\'m glad to help you on your way."\r\n\r\nLenner mounted the machine, and Burwell beamed a thought at Corrigan.\r\n\r\n"_I\'ve convinced him that the thing works, and that it would not be\r\neasy to come back. Actually, that machine of his is a real work of art.\r\nIt doesn\'t do a damn thing. This boy comes from a place where they\r\nhave to have a mechanical crutch for everything. His gadgets are pink\r\npill stuff ... something to convince him he can do things he could do\r\nanyway. All we have to do now is give him a small mental shove to help\r\nhim along, and he\'ll be home in no time. All right, now--SHOVE!_"\r\n\r\nCorrigan and Burwell shoved. Lenner and his machine faded and were\r\ngone, leaving only a flattened place on the grass.\r\n\r\n"Brrr," Burwell said. "Am I glad that worked! If he\'d stayed another\r\nweek or so we would have had our first lunatic of the century."\r\n\r\n"Or worse," Corrigan said, stirring the grass with his toes. "Did you\r\nget what he was thinking about when he talked about his world and ours\r\ngetting into touch, and civilizing us?"\r\n\r\n"I got it, all right." Burwell said. "The fellow\'s mind was a swamp. A\r\nreal primitive. And just like any other primitive, all he needed was a\r\nplacebo from a witch doctor. Me, in my savage regalia. Just let me get\r\nthis thing with the glass in it off my nose, and these button things\r\nopened up a bit, and we can get on with that chess game. I hope the\r\nnext traveler picks somewhere else to land, though--I\'ve never felt so\r\nsilly in my life!"\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
