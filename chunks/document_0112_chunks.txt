It was odd,\r\nthis sensation of having nothing under you, nothing to keep you from\r\nfalling back upon the world from which the sleek grey space ship had\r\nlifted you. Lorre felt uneasy. He had traveled in rockets hundreds of\r\ntimes, of course; but this was his first flight into space.\r\n\r\nRockets had already been in use for nearly a century; but none had ever\r\nbefore ventured into outer space since the first one had met a horrible\r\nend in the Heaviside Layer. As a result of that incident, small rockets\r\nhad been developed for flight between cities, and, unhappily, for war.\r\n\r\nFinally a large space cruiser, equipped with the Lorre\r\npolari-neutralizer, set out in a second attempt to pierce the H-layer.\r\nAppropriately named the _New Hope_, it had just left Earth on its way\r\nto the Moon.\r\n\r\nLorre felt that some weird, alien menace confronted them. The details\r\nof the outcome of the first attempted flight to the moon lingered in\r\nhis mind. He had looked forward to this day with eagerness; yet now\r\nhe wished that he hadn\'t come along. Crushed down into the pneumatic\r\ncushions by the acceleration, his vision was so restricted that he\r\ncould see nothing but the Earth falling away from the ship, down, down.\r\n\r\nThe Lorre polari-neutralizer had been designed to send out a powerful\r\nfield of polarized force that neutralized the energy charge of the\r\nLayer, and so shield the ship from the raging storm of ions that\r\ncompose the ionosphere. James "Jimmy" Lorre, the inventor, had made\r\nsure of that. But the ionoscreen, which was to keep cosmic rays and\r\nother harmful radiations from the vessel\'s occupants beyond the Layer,\r\nhad been impossible to test. Math, however, had proved that it would\r\nfunction correctly.\r\n\r\n"Dr. Lorre!"\r\n\r\nThe ship had stopped accelerating, so that the pilot might have the\r\nfullest co-operation from his reflexes while passing the ionosphere.\r\n\r\n"Call me Jimmy," Lorre said succinctly. "Everybody does. What is it?"\r\n\r\nThe pilot motioned toward the complex mechanism that stood between\r\nthem and annihilation in the turbulent ionic sea they were swiftly\r\napproaching. "I wanted you to be on hand in case anything goes wrong.\r\nEven without the polari-neutralizer, the hull will stand up a few\r\nminutes, in case a wire comes loose in your machine, or something."\r\n\r\nLorre nodded. The pilot, always a thorough man, was taking no chances.\r\n\r\nHammond, at the controls of the _New Hope_, watched the chronometer\r\nlike a hawk. If the shield were applied too soon, the power would not\r\nlast; if too late, the ship would be destroyed.\r\n\r\nHe signaled the physicist. Lorre flipped the switch, gaining\r\nsatisfaction from the humming drone that came from the generators. An\r\ninstant later, they hit the Layer.\r\n\r\nLivid sheets of flame danced outside the portholes as the surging ions\r\nfought to break the shield that enveloped the ship with the intrepid\r\nband of spacefarers aboard. Could they cheat nature with their science?\r\nThe hull began to grow hot. Lorre increased the power.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Lurid sheets of flame danced outside the portholes as\r\nthe surging ions sought to break the shield._]\r\n\r\nThen they were through! The tremendous velocity gained before\r\ncutting the acceleration had carried them through! They were now in\r\nthe star-specked blackness of outer space, their ionoscreen, which\r\nduplicated conditions in the H-layer, surrounding the craft at a safe\r\ndistance. Apparently it was keeping the cosmic rays out as predicted.\r\n\r\nIt had been done at last! Space travel was an accomplished thing. Mars,\r\nVenus, the Major Planets, all were within man\'s reach. It was the dawn\r\nof a new era!\r\n\r\nHammond, the pilot, turned to congratulate the physicist who had made\r\nall this possible. But his grin faded, he raised his eyebrows in\r\nastonishment at what he saw. Lorre, having experienced the successful\r\nculmination of years of effort, lay on the floor of the control room,\r\napparently fast asleep!\r\n\r\nThat the polari-neutralizer would be a success, Lorre had felt certain.\r\nBut he could not control the elation he felt as they passed the outer\r\nedge of the Layer. _He_ had made it possible!\r\n\r\nSomeone whispered. The physicist looked at Hammond. The pilot was\r\nstaring out the port. Then he heard it again. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
But this time it\r\nwas--commanding! Commanding him to lie down!\r\n\r\nLorre did so. He seemed unable to summon the will power to resist.\r\nThe whisper went on. It seemed to be communicating directly with his\r\nmind, without the use of the indirect route through sense organs. When\r\nLorre realized that the whisper began to form coherent words. He became\r\noblivious to all else.\r\n\r\nThus it was that when Hammond tore his gaze from the port, he found the\r\nphysicist in a comatose condition. Rapidly, he summoned the rest of the\r\ncrew.\r\n\r\nIt consisted of--a doctor, a bio-chemist, a metallurgist, and a\r\nmechanic. They had been picked out of hundreds of volunteers. Able men,\r\nthey were ready for any emergency that might arise.\r\n\r\nThe doctor immediately tried to bring the seemingly unconscious man\r\naround. Lorre came to suddenly.\r\n\r\n"What\'s wrong?" he inquired of the doctor, who explained as much as he\r\nknew, which was little.\r\n\r\n"Of course," said Lorre. "I might have known." Then, "Hammond!"\r\n\r\n"Yes?"\r\n\r\n"Decelerate immediately. We must return to Earth as soon as possible."\r\n\r\n"But the moon?"\r\n\r\n"The moon is comparatively unimportant now. Besides, I can tell you\r\nexactly what we would find there. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
I\'ll explain everything as we go\r\nback. Start the generators. We must accumulate power to penetrate the\r\nH-layer on our return."\r\n\r\nLorre being the leader, the pilot adjusted the jets to turn.\r\n\r\n"Now, would you explain this rather--er--abrupt alteration in our\r\nplans, Dr. Lorre?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly. Call the rest of the men back.

=== Chunk 4 ===
"\r\n\r\nHammond did so. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
The mechanic appeared undisturbed; he wasn\'t even\r\ncurious. The bio-chemist and the metallurgist were greatly interested;\r\nthe doctor wondered whether the success of the polari-neutralizer had\r\nshaken the sanity of its inventor.\r\n\r\n"The universe," began Dr. Lorre, "is full of mysteries as yet unsolved.\r\nOne of these is the cosmic rays.\r\n\r\n"We know little of their origin or their properties. It seems, however,\r\nthat they have a marked effect on evolution.\r\n\r\n"The Kennelly-Heaviside Layer screens out most of these rays. It is as\r\na result of this that evolution can go slowly forward toward its goal.\r\nFor should all the cosmic rays reach Earth, life would devolve back\r\ninto protoplasm!\r\n\r\n"In the back of the so-called Horse\'s Head dark nebula is a dying star.\r\nThe nebula shields us from the cosmic rays it gives off. But in only\r\na few years our sun will carry us directly in the path of a deluge of\r\nthese rays against which our ionosphere will be too weak! Man will go\r\nback to the caveman days from which he emerged. But he will not stop\r\nthere. He will go back to primal protoplasm. Then, because the ray\r\nbarrage will be too strong for it, it will die. All life will go the\r\nsame way. In less than one million years, the world will be devoid of\r\nlife!\r\n\r\n"There is a way out. We can build a machine to strengthen the Heaviside\r\nLayer. It will be merely an ionoscreen around the entire world, to hold\r\nback the rays that pass the natural ionosphere. I have been given the\r\ndetails of the machine, and by the time we arrive on Earth I will have\r\nthem down on paper--"\r\n\r\n"But how do you know all this?" 

=== Chunk 6 ===
the doctor interrupted. He was still in\r\ndoubt about Lorre\'s sanity.\r\n\r\n"On Mars there is an age old civilization that faces the same peril,"\r\nwas the reply. "For years they have been trying to warn us of what\r\nthey knew would come. Their telepathy, however, was unable to pierce\r\nour H-layer. When we emerged from it, they immediately detected our\r\nthought vibrations, which are not stopped by the ionoscreen, and began\r\ncommunication with the most receptive mind aboard. It happened to be\r\nmine."\r\n\r\n"So when I found you lying in a comatose condition, you were talking to\r\nthe Martians?" asked Hammond, dazedly.\r\n\r\n"That\'s right. The sooner we can start building the ionoscreen machine\r\nas the Martians have already done, the better we\'ll be off.\r\n\r\n"It is likely that you are wondering as to whether I am in full\r\npossession of all my mental faculties, doctor. You will find that I am\r\nquite sane when the first Earth-Mars trip is made. The Martians are\r\neven now preparing to receive visitors from Earth. They have no space\r\nships; their science of mechanics is not as highly developed as ours."\r\n\r\nRocket tubes flaring silently in the void, the _New Hope_ turned its\r\nnose Earthward, bearing the timely warning that would save mankind from\r\na terrible fate.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
