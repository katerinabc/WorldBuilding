Will the destruction be told as briefly?_\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was a gigantic figure, sitting there atop the mountain. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
He could have\r\nleaned over and dammed the river below with a finger. He sat on top of\r\nthe mountain, and his beard in the wind was a white flag.\r\n\r\nAcross the plains, as he watched, there were fires glowing, and the\r\nmountain under him trembled from explosions a thousand miles away. He\r\nbent his head, and a muffled cry reverberated down the hillside and\r\nthrough the valley.\r\n\r\nA smaller figure appeared beside him, looking sad.\r\n\r\n"Try again, father," the smaller one said.\r\n\r\nThe old one shook his head. "It would be the same."\r\n\r\n"Give them another chance."\r\n\r\n"They would do it again."\r\n\r\n"Just once more."\r\n\r\nThe old one shook his head again, and for a while they sat, and they\r\nwatched the destruction. The fires burned higher, and the explosions\r\nshook their mountain more roughly.\r\n\r\nAt last, at the end, the old one reached down and scooped up some clay\r\nfrom the bank of the river. He held it in a huge, gentle hand, and the\r\nyounger one smiled.\r\n\r\n"You are good to give them another chance, father."\r\n\r\n"Not them," said the old one.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" the son asked, wonderingly.\r\n\r\n"Something else," the majestic figure answered, starting to knead the\r\nclay. "What shall it be?"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Illustrator: Ray Houlihan]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ Oct.-Nov. 1953.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.
