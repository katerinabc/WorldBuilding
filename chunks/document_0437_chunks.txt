10,000. An old man, more than six hundred years of age, was\r\nwalking with a boy through a great museum. The people who were moving\r\naround them had beautiful forms, and faces which were indescribably\r\nrefined and spiritual.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy, \xe2\x80\x9cyou promised to tell me to-day about the Dark\r\nAges. I like to hear how men lived and thought long ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is no easy task to make you understand the past,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is hard to realize that man could have been so ignorant as he was\r\neight thousand years ago, but come with me; I will show you\r\nsomething.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe led the boy to a cabinet containing a few time-worn books bound in\r\nsolid gold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have never seen a book,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, taking out a large volume and\r\ncarefully placing it on a silk cushion on a table. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are only a\r\nfew in the leading museums of the world. Time was when there were as\r\nmany books on earth as inhabitants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot understand,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy with a look of perplexity on his\r\nintellectual face. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot see what people could have wanted with\r\nthem; they are not attractive; they seem to be useless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was your age, the subject was too deep for\r\nme; but as I grew older and made a close study of the history of the\r\npast, the use of books gradually became plain to me. We know that in\r\nthe year 2000 they were read by the best minds. To make you understand\r\nthis, I shall first have to explain that eight thousand years ago\r\nhuman beings communicated their thoughts to one another by making\r\nsounds with their tongues, and not by mind-reading, as you and I do.\r\nTo understand me, you have simply to read my thoughts as well as your\r\neducation will permit; but primitive man knew nothing about\r\nthought-intercourse, so he invented speech. Humanity then was divided\r\nup in various races, and each race had a separate language. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
As certain\r\nsounds conveyed definite ideas, so did signs and letters; and later,\r\nto facilitate the exchange of thought, writing and printing were\r\ninvented. This book was printed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy leaned forward and examined the pages closely; his young brow\r\nclouded. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot understand,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cit seems so useless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man put his delicate fingers on the page. \xe2\x80\x9cA line of these\r\nwords may have conveyed a valuable thought to a reader long ago,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, reflectively. \xe2\x80\x9cIn fact, this book purports to be a history of\r\nthe world up to the year 2000. Here are some pictures,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued,\r\nturning the worn leaves carefully. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is George Washington; this a\r\npope of a church called the Roman Catholic; this is a man named\r\nGladstone, who was a great political leader in England. Pictures then,\r\nas you see, were very crude. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
We have preserved some of the oil\r\npaintings made in those days. Art was in its cradle. In producing a\r\npainting of an object, the early artists mixed colored paints and\r\nspread them according to taste on stretched canvas or on the walls or\r\nwindows of buildings. You know that our artists simply throw light and\r\ndarkness into space in the necessary variations, and the effect is all\r\nthat could be desired in the way of imitating nature. See that\r\nlandscape in the alcove before you. The foliage of the trees, the\r\ngrass, the flowers, the stretch of water, have every appearance of\r\nlife because the light which produces them is alive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy looked at the scene admiringly for a few minutes, then bent\r\nagain over the book. Presently he recoiled from the pictures, a\r\nstrange look of disgust struggling in his tender features.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese men have awful faces,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
\xe2\x80\x9cThey are so unlike people\r\nliving now. The man you call a pope looks like an animal. They all\r\nhave huge mouths and frightfully heavy jaws. Surely men could not have\r\nlooked like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d the old man replied, gently. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no doubt that human\r\nbeings then bore a nearer resemblance to the lower animals than we now\r\ndo. In the sculpture and portraits of all ages we can trace a gradual\r\nrefinement in the appearances of men. The features of the human race\r\nto-day are more ideal. Thought has always given form and expression to\r\nfaces. In those dark days the thoughts of men were not refined. Human\r\nbeings died of starvation and lack of attention in cities where there\r\nwere people so wealthy that they could not use their fortunes. And\r\nthey were so nearly related to the lower animals that they believed in\r\nwar. George Washington was for several centuries reverenced by\r\nmillions of people as a great and good man; and yet under his\r\nleadership thousands of human beings lost their lives in battle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy\xe2\x80\x99s susceptible face turned white.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean that he encouraged men to kill one another?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked,\r\nbending more closely over the book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but we cannot blame him; he thought he was right. Millions of\r\nhis countrymen applauded him. A greater warrior than he was a man\r\nnamed Napoleon Bonaparte. Washington fought under the belief that he\r\nwas doing his country a service in defending it against enemies, but\r\neverything in history goes to prove that Bonaparte waged war to\r\ngratify a personal ambition to distinguish himself as a hero. Wild\r\nanimals of the lowest orders were courageous, and would fight one\r\nanother till they died; and yet the most refined of the human race,\r\neight or nine thousand years ago, prided themselves on the same\r\nferocity of nature. Women, the gentlest half of humanity, honored men\r\nmore for bold achievements in shedding blood than for any other\r\nquality. But murder was not only committed in wars; men in private\r\nlife killed one another; fathers and mothers were now and then so\r\ndepraved as to put their own children to death; and the highest\r\ntribunals of the world executed murderers without dreaming that it was\r\nwrong, erroneously believing that to kill was the only way to prevent\r\nkilling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid no one in those days realize that it was horrible?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the\r\nyouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the father, \xe2\x80\x9cas far back as ten thousand years ago\r\nthere was an humble man, it is said, who was called Jesus Christ. He\r\nwent from place to place, telling every one he met that the world\r\nwould be better if men would love one another as themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat kind of man was he?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the boy, with kindling eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was a spiritual genius,\xe2\x80\x9d was the earnest reply, \xe2\x80\x9cand the greatest\r\nthat has ever lived.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he prevent them from killing one another?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the youth, with\r\na tender upward glance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, for he himself was killed by men who were too barbarous to\r\nunderstand him. But long after his death his words were remembered.\r\nPeople were not civilized enough to put his teachings into practice,\r\nbut they were able to see that he was right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter he was killed, did the people not do as he had told them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nasked the youth, after a pause of several minutes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems not,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply. \xe2\x80\x9cThey said no human being could live as\r\nhe had directed. And when he had been dead for several centuries,\r\npeople began to say that he was the Son of God who had come to earth\r\nto show men how to live. Some even believed that he was God himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid they believe that he was a person like ourselves?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man reflected for a few minutes, then, looking into the boy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neager face, he answered: \xe2\x80\x9cThat subject will be hard for you to\r\nunderstand. I will try to make it plain. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
To the unformed minds of\r\nearly humanity there could be nothing without a personal creator. As\r\nman could build a house with his own hands, and was superior to his\r\nwork, so he argued that some unknown being, greater than all visible\r\nthings, had made the universe. They called that being by different\r\nnames according to the language they spoke. In English the word used\r\nwas \xe2\x80\x98God.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey believed that somebody had made the universe!\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chow very strange!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not somebody as you comprehend it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the father gently,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut some vague, infinite being who punished the evil and rewarded the\r\ngood. Men could form no idea of a creator that did not in some way\r\nresemble themselves; and as they could subdue their enemies through\r\nfear and by the infliction of pain, so did they believe that God would\r\npunish those who did not please him. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Some people long ago believed\r\nthat God\xe2\x80\x99s punishment was inflicted after death for eternity. The\r\nnumerous beliefs about the personality and laws of the creator caused\r\nmore bloodshed in the gloomy days of the past than anything else.\r\nReligion was the foundation of many of the most horrible wars. People\r\ncommitted thousands of crimes in the name of the God of the universe.\r\nMen and women were burned alive because they would not believe certain\r\ncreeds, and yet they adhered to convictions equally as preposterous;\r\nbut you will learn all these things later in life. That picture before\r\nyou was the last queen of England, called Victoria.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hoped that the women would not have such repulsive features as the\r\nmen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy, looking critically at the picture, \xe2\x80\x9cbut this face\r\nmakes me shudder. Why do they all look so coarse and brutal?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople living when this queen reigned had the most degrading habit\r\nthat ever blackened the history of mankind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the youth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe consumption of flesh. They believed that animals, fowls, and fish\r\nwere created to be eaten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible?\xe2\x80\x9d The boy shuddered convulsively, and turned away from\r\nthe book. \xe2\x80\x9cI understand now why their faces repel me so. I do not like\r\nto think that we have descended from such people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey knew no better,\xe2\x80\x9d said the father. \xe2\x80\x9cAs they gradually became more\r\nrefined they learned to burn the meat over flames and to cook it in\r\nheated vessels to change its appearance. The places where animals were\r\nkilled and sold were withdrawn to retired places. Mankind was slowly\r\nturning from the habit, but they did not know it. As early as 2050\r\nlearned men, calling themselves vegetarians, proved conclusively that\r\nthe consumption of such food was cruel and barbarous, and that it\r\nretarded refinement and mental growth. However, it was not till about\r\n2300 that the vegetarian movement became of marked importance. The\r\nmost highly educated classes in all lands adopted vegetarianism, and\r\nonly the uneducated continued to kill and eat animals. The vegetarians\r\ntried for years to enact laws prohibiting the consumption of flesh,\r\nbut opposition was very strong. In America in 2320 a colony was formed\r\nconsisting of about three hundred thousand vegetarians. They purchased\r\nlarge tracts of land in what was known as the Indian Territory, and\r\nthere made their homes, determined to prove by example the efficacy of\r\ntheir tenets. Within the first year the colony had doubled its number:\r\npeople joined it from all parts of the globe. In the year 4000 it was\r\na country of its own, and was the wonder of the world. The brightest\r\nminds were born there. The greatest discoveries and inventions were\r\nmade by its inhabitants. In 4030 Gillette discovered the process of\r\nmanufacturing crystal. Up to that time people had built their houses\r\nof natural stone, inflammable wood, and metals; but the new material,\r\nbeing fireproof and beautiful in its various colors, was used for all\r\nbuilding purposes. In 4050 Holloway found the submerged succession of\r\nmountain chains across the Atlantic Ocean, and intended to construct a\r\nbridge on their summits; but the vast improvement in air ships\r\nrendered his plans impracticable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn 4051 John Saunders discovered and put into practice\r\nthought-telegraphy. This discovery was the signal for the introduction\r\nin schools and colleges of the science of mind-reading, and by the\r\nyear 5000 so great had been the progress in that branch of knowledge\r\nthat words were spoken only among the lowest of the uneducated. In no\r\nage of the world\xe2\x80\x99s history has there been such an important discovery.\r\nIt civilized the world. Its early promoters did not dream of the vast\r\ngood mind-reading would accomplish. Slowly it killed evil. Societies\r\nfor the prevention of evil thought were organized in all lands.\r\nChildren were born pure of mind and grew up in purity. Crime was\r\nchoked out of existence. If a man had an evil thought, it was read in\r\nhis heart, and he was not allowed to keep it. Men at first shunned\r\nevil for fear of detection, and then grew to love purity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the year 6021 all countries of the world, having then a common\r\nlanguage, and being drawn together in brotherly love by constant\r\nexchange of thought, agreed to call themselves a union without ruler\r\nor rulers. It was the greatest event in the history of the world.\r\nCertain sensitive mind students in Germany, who had for years been\r\ntrying to communicate with other planets through the channel of\r\nthought, declared that, owing to the terrestrial unanimity of purpose\r\nin that direction, they had received mental impressions from other\r\nworlds, and that thorough interplanetary intercourse was a future\r\npossibility.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImportant inventions were made as the mind of humanity grew more\r\nelevated. Thornton discovered the plan to heat the earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface\r\nfrom its internal fire, and this discovery made journeys to the\r\nwonderful ice-bound countries situated at the North and the South\r\nPoles easy of accomplishment. At the North Pole, in the extensive\r\nconcave lands, was found a peculiar race of men. Their sun was the\r\ngreat perpetually boiling lake of lava which bubbled from the centre\r\nof the earth in the bottom of their bowl-shaped world. And a strange\r\nreligion was theirs! They believed that the earth was a monster on\r\nwhose hide they had to live for a mortal lifetime, and that to the\r\ngood was given the power after death to walk over the icy waste to\r\ntheir god, whose starry eyes they could see twinkling in space, and\r\nthat the evil were condemned to feed the fire in the stomach of the\r\nmonster as long as it lived. They told beautiful stories about the\r\ncreation of their world, and held that if they lived too near the hot,\r\ndazzling mouth of evil, they would become blinded to the soft,\r\nforgiving eyes of the god of space. Hence they suffered the extreme\r\ncold of the lands near the frozen seas, believing that the physical\r\nordeal prepared them for the icy journey to immortal rest after death.\r\nBut there were those who hungered after the balmy atmosphere and the\r\nwonderful fruits and flowers that grew in the lowlands, and they lived\r\nthere in indolence and so-called sin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man and his son left the museum and walked into a wonderful\r\npark. Flowers of the most beautiful kinds and of sweetest fragrance\r\ngrew on all sides. They came to a tall tower, four thousand feet in\r\nheight, built of manufactured crystal. Something, like a great white\r\nbird, a thousand feet long, flew across the sky and settled down on\r\nthe tower\xe2\x80\x99s summit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis was one of the most wonderful inventions of the Seventieth\r\ncentury,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cThe early inhabitants of the earth could\r\nnot have dreamed that it would be possible to go around it in\r\ntwenty-four hours. In fact, there was a time when they were not able\r\nto go around it at all. Scientists were astonished when a man called\r\nMalburn, a great inventor, announced that, at a height of four\r\nthousand feet, he could disconnect an air ship from the laws of\r\ngravitation, and cause it to stand still in space till the earth had\r\nturned over. Fancy what must have been that immortal genius\xe2\x80\x99 feelings\r\nwhen he stood in space and saw the earth for the first time whirling\r\nbeneath him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey walked on for some distance across the park till they came to a\r\ngreat instrument made to magnify the music in light. Here they paused\r\nand seated themselves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will soon be night,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cThe tones are those of\r\nbleeding sunset. I came here last evening to listen to the musical\r\nstruggle between the light of dying day and that of the coming stars.\r\nThe sunlight had been playing a powerful solo; but the gentle chorus\r\nof the stars, led by the moon, was inexplicably touching. Light is the\r\nvoice of immortality; it speaks in all things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn hour passed. It was growing dark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me what immortality is,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does life lead to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe do not know,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we knew we would be\r\ninfinite. Immortality is increasing happiness for all time; it is\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nA meteor shot across the sky. There was a burst of musical laughter\r\namong the singing stars. The old man bent over the boy\xe2\x80\x99s face and\r\nkissed it. \xe2\x80\x9cImmortality,\xe2\x80\x9d said he\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cimmortality must be love immortal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
