=== Chunk 2 ===
It was the perfect State. If you doubted it, you died._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Clean and Wholesome Land\r\n\r\nBy Ralph Sholto\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Professor Cargill lectured from the rostrum, Neal Pardeau prowled\r\nthe dark auditorium. This, he knew, was the place to find them. Here was\r\nwhere they whispered and plotted and schemed--feeling safe in this pure,\r\nhard core of patriotism.\r\n\r\nSafe because Cargill was the Director of Education in the New State,\r\njust as Pardeau was the Director of Public Security. Safe because\r\nCargill\'s lectures were given before a commanded audience, with\r\nattendance strictly mandatory.\r\n\r\nThe insistence was not really necessary of course. The people would have\r\ncome to hear Cargill regardless. His was a compelling, magnetic\r\npersonality. Even now his great voice was booming out:\r\n\r\n"--and upon this anniversary of the New State, we can look out with\r\ngreat pride upon a clean and wholesome land. With strong emotion, we can\r\nlook upon the physical manifestation of our glorious principles--that\r\nonly through self-effacement--through fanatic love for the state--can\r\nthe individual come to complete physical and mental fruition. Upon this\r\nanniversary we see our enemies, both within and without, broken, and\r\ncompletely subjugated--"\r\n\r\nThis was the place they whispered and schemed and plotted. Pardeau\r\nprowled the aisles, his eyes piercing the darkness--spotting them,\r\ncataloguing them. And thus he came upon Emil Hillerman, his Deputy of\r\nVital Intelligence sitting dutifully in the end seat of a middle aisle.\r\nHillerman\'s thick lips hung lax, his eyes squinted laboriously as he\r\nsought to follow the thread of Cargill\'s lecture.\r\n\r\nPardeau tapped Hillerman on the shoulder. The latter started guiltily.\r\nHe whirled and sought to identify Pardeau in the semi-darkness. Pardeau\r\nsaid, "Please step outside with me. I have some questions."\r\n\r\nThere was fear in Hillerman\'s bearing as he got clumsily to his feet and\r\nfollowed Pardeau. But none of Cargill\'s speech was missed. A battery of\r\nloudspeakers carried it even into the foyer where Pardeau stopped and\r\nturned on Hillerman. He regarded the man through cold, calculating eyes.\r\nHe seemed to be both enjoying Hillerman\'s discomfort and also listening\r\nto Cargill\'s booming words.\r\n\r\n"--these pale weaklings, these traitors with twitching muscles and\r\ntwitching minds who skulked in dark places have been finally and\r\ndecisively defeated. Even their vaunted leader--"\r\n\r\n"What have you been doing," Pardeau asked, "relative to Karl Lenster?"\r\n\r\nThe frightened Hillerman licked his fat lower lip as he sought for\r\nwords. "Everything--everything possible. But Lenster is clever. You know\r\nthat. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
You know that yourself."\r\n\r\nPardeau\'s eyes bored into those of the Intelligence Director. They were\r\nnoted for their icy penetration, but upon this night they were like\r\nsteel knives. It was as though he surveyed Hillerman from behind the\r\nbulwark of some new and hostile information. Even as he stared, Cargill\r\nwas booming from the rostrum:\r\n\r\n"--Karl Lenster, their _peerless_ leader--"\r\n\r\nAnd Cargill\'s voice crackled with the inflections of pure contempt.\r\n\r\n"--a degenerate--a dope addict whose greatness lay only in the realms of\r\nhis sensual dreams. A weak, pitiful figure bereft of followers, cringing\r\nalone in--"\r\n\r\nWhen Pardeau spoke, his voice held a new sharpness to complement the new\r\nice in his eyes. He said, "In half an hour I am attending a meeting of\r\nthe Council. They will want a report. What about Lenster?"\r\n\r\nHillerman looked quickly to right and left, then back at his Chief. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
He\r\nhesitated as though fearing the consequences of what he was about to\r\nreveal. "You know of the Wyckoff Chemical Transformation Process--"\r\n\r\n"Certainly I know of it," Pardeau blazed. "What about it?"\r\n\r\n"I--I--" But Hillerman seemed to lose the courage he\'d screwed up to\r\ncontinue in this direction. He straightened and a little of the hangdog\r\nservility dropped away. "I am doing all that is humanly possible to\r\napprehend Lenster. All that any man could do. The secret jails are full.\r\nMy interrogators work night and day. Even a superficial check of my\r\nrecords would show that more has been done in the last six months and is\r\nbeing done now than--"\r\n\r\nPardeau raised an impatient hand, opening a gap of silence into which\r\nthe voice of Cargill poured.\r\n\r\n"--land in which the voice of dissenter is not heard; in which Lenster\r\nand men of his despicable ilk are forever crushed and beaten--"\r\n\r\nPardeau was scowling. Almost unconsciously he had held the pause, with\r\nhand upraised, until Cargill finished his passage. As Cargill stopped\r\nfor breath, Pardeau jerked his hand down sharply, completing the\r\ngesture. "I have no time for any more of this. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
And I resent having to\r\nseek you out. Next time report to my office as is proper and keep me\r\nposted as to your activities. Next--"\r\n\r\nPardeau eyed Hillerman for one blank moment and allowed the threat to\r\nreflect clearly that possibly there would not be many more next times.\r\nThen he turned and strode swiftly from the foyer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCargill\'s voice had hardly faded when he picked it up again on his car\r\nradio. It was a foregone conclusion that every radio in the land would\r\nbe tuned to the lecture. So great was Cargill\'s popularity that every\r\ncitizen traveling in a car would wish to hear it and turn on his\r\nreceiver. It was foolish not to have a radio properly tuned when Cargill\r\nspoke. He was saying:\r\n\r\n"--and so under the banner of complete solidarity, we will march\r\nforward, a solid phalanx against which no force can stand. Now that our\r\nown house is swept clean of vermin--rid forever of carrion like Lenster\r\nand his ilk, we can--"\r\n\r\nPardeau had traveled swiftly through the streets at the high speed\r\nreserved for higher servants of the New State. Lesser servants of the\r\nNew State had learned caution and thus no regrettable deaths or maimings\r\noccurred; the lesser servants having grown wary and fleet of foot.\r\n\r\nPardeau switched off his motor but left his radio blaring. Cargill\'s\r\nvoice followed him up the broad steps of the Executive Building and was\r\njust fading out when Pardeau was able to pick it up again from the\r\nloudspeaker under the great arches.\r\n\r\nHe entered the building and traversed the vast foyer to a niche which\r\nhoused a private elevator. He entered the lift, deserting it on the\r\nninth floor, where he entered an unobtrusive door and joined a group\r\nwhich consisted of the New State\'s well guarded pool of power and\r\nbrains.\r\n\r\nThere was Blanchard of Finance; Keeley, Director of Foreign Education;\r\nMasichek, overlord of the nation\'s larder, and seven others.\r\n\r\nWhen Pardeau entered, all conversation stopped and every man looked up\r\nfrom a luxurious overstuffed chair. Pardeau must certainly have swelled\r\ninwardly with pride at this unconscious tribute. It was well known that\r\nhe held a key position on the chessboard of politics. His was in reality\r\nthe most important job of all. It was to Pardeau that this powerful\r\ngroup of men looked for that which they most treasured--their own\r\npersonal safety.\r\n\r\nA chair was waiting for Pardeau. He said, "I\'m sorry to be late,\r\ngentlemen. I have been on a personal tour of inspection. I\'m sure you\r\nwill forgive me however. I have a most interesting report."\r\n\r\nHe seated himself, timing the action so it coincided with the ebb of\r\napplause coming over the speaker--applause from the loyal multitudes\r\nwho had just heard Professor Cargill end his lecture. As it was now\r\npermissible, Blanchard reached under the table and snapped a button. The\r\nspeaker went silent.\r\n\r\n"An interesting report?" Keeley asked.\r\n\r\n"Amazingly so," Pardeau said. "I have just unearthed a traitor--a\r\ntraitor in a high place."\r\n\r\nEvery man in the group strove not to react and this striving was in\r\nitself a reaction. "Most interesting," Blanchard murmured. "Are you\r\nready to name names?"\r\n\r\n"That is my intention, but in order to forestall a great many questions,\r\nlet me give you a complete background."\r\n\r\nLeiderman, Ambassador without Portfolio, and very close to the Man of\r\nAlmost Sacred Name who never attended these meetings, felt strong enough\r\nto evince impatience. "The name, man! First the name. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Then the details."\r\n\r\nPardeau smiled coldly. "Very well. The name is, Karl Lenster."\r\n\r\nLeiderman sprang from his chair, his face bordering on purple. "Is this\r\na joke, Pardeau? We all know Lenster is the arch-traitor of our\r\ntimes--the leader of the resistance movement. Talk sense!"\r\n\r\nPardeau, not in the least disconcerted, smiled coldly. "I\'m sorry.\r\nPerhaps I should have said Emil Hillerman, my Deputy of Vital\r\nIntelligence, the man who holds immeasurable power in his two hands."\r\n\r\nBlanchard was not given to outbursts. But his lips were grim as he said,\r\n"We are waiting for you to talk sense, Pardeau."\r\n\r\n"The confusion comes from your not allowing me to tell it as I wished.\r\nThere is a gap between Lenster and Hillerman; one which--with your\r\npermission--I will fill."\r\n\r\n"Talk, man! 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Talk!"\r\n\r\n"You have all heard of Formula 652, known also as the Wyckoff Chemical\r\nTransformation Process."\r\n\r\nThere were expressions of both understanding and bewilderment. Noting\r\nthese, Pardeau said, "For those of you who haven\'t made a point of\r\nlooking into the thing, I\'ll explain. Wyckoff, in case you don\'t recall,\r\nwas a chemical engineer of more than average ability who stumbled onto\r\nthis formula before he died, most regretfully, four years ago, in 1984."\r\n\r\nLeiderman continued to scowl. "We all know each other, Pardeau. Call a\r\nspade a spade. Wyckoff was a reactionary scoundrel whom you did away\r\nwith for reasons of security."\r\n\r\n"Precisely," Pardeau said. "In its essence, the formula is a process for\r\ntaking over a man\'s brain--his body--his personality."\r\n\r\n"You mean--"\r\n\r\nPardeau refused to be interrupted. "We were of the opinion that Wyckoff,\r\nthough he and Lenster were great friends, was not able to impart his\r\nknowledge to the latter. We took him into custody shortly after he\r\nperfected the formula and were fortunate in persuading him to give it to\r\nus."\r\n\r\n"But he gave it to Lenster also?"\r\n\r\n"We were certain, at the time of his death, that he had not been able to\r\ndo that--we are still certain."\r\n\r\nKeeley, with a gesture, requested the floor. "I wonder if you could go\r\ninto a little more detail concerning the formula--for those of us who--"\r\n\r\n"Of course," Pardeau said. "The formula is a combination of six\r\nchemicals and the process of transformation is relatively simple, yet\r\nhighly dangerous to both subjects involved. It means sure death for the\r\nproposed host, and if not delicately handled will also result in death\r\nfor the usurper. The transformation requires three hours to perform.\r\nOnce completed successfully, the usurper can never return to his own\r\nbody. It must be destroyed. Also, the mentality of the host vanishes\r\nafter it is pushed from its original brain tissue through the influence\r\nof the formula."\r\n\r\n"Then if Wyckoff didn\'t give the formula to Lenster, it was stolen from\r\nour vaults--or wherever it was kept?"\r\n\r\n"Exactly. Certain investigations I have made prove beyond doubt that\r\nLenster got to my Deputy, Hillerman. I never considered Hillerman very\r\nbright, but I thought him to be honest and loyal. But beyond all doubt,\r\nwith his aid, Lenster stole the formula--possibly got it verbally--and\r\nused it to take Hillerman\'s body from him." Pardeau smiled grimly.\r\n"Therefore, gentlemen, we have a traitor in a high place. My Deputy of\r\nVital Intelligence."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPardeau sat silent now, seeming to enjoy the fear he had engendered in\r\nhis colleagues--sat silent until Leiderman said, "You\'ve arrested him of\r\ncourse."\r\n\r\n"No. I have not."\r\n\r\n"Then get at it, man--get at it."\r\n\r\n"I have no intention of arresting Hillerman."\r\n\r\nLeiderman\'s eyes widened as did those of the rest of the company. But\r\nBlanchard, even under the impact of such a bombshell had the presence of\r\nmind to glance at his watch. Immediately he snapped on the loudspeaker.\r\nThe voice of Professor Cargill blared forth:\r\n\r\n"--and upon this anniversary of the New State, we can look with pride\r\nupon a clean and wholesome land--"\r\n\r\nIt was the rebroadcast, from recordings, of Cargill\'s speech and no man\r\nin his right mind would have refrained from tuning it in because\r\neveryone wanted to hear it at least twice.\r\n\r\nLeiderman, almost apoplectic, ignored the speech. "Not arresting him!\r\nAre you mad?

=== Chunk 8 ===
"\r\n\r\n"I\'m quite sane, and the situation is well in hand." Pardeau grinned and\r\nthere was wickedness in the grin--wickedness and intelligence. "As I\r\nsaid before, Hillerman was not a smart man. His job was too much for\r\nhim and I would have been faced, soon, with the necessity of replacing\r\nhim regardless. Lenster, on the other hand, is of grade-A intellect.\r\nBut, gentlemen, he is frightened--badly frightened in his new\r\nenvironment--and, in order to insure his own safety, is doing an\r\nexcellent job. Ever since the transformation, that department has gained\r\nin efficiency until it now ranks as one of the highest in our entire\r\ngovernment."\r\n\r\nSlowly, Pardeau\'s strategy dawned on the group. Blanchard suddenly\r\nsmiled. Then Pardeau scowled and went on with a new and sudden ferocity.\r\n"I have the proof, and I have Lenster-Hillerman under my palm. So he\r\nstays--continues to do a good job for us. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
But he\'ll be watched,\r\ngentlemen. He won\'t be able to go to the bathroom without being under\r\nsurveillance. We will learn a great deal from him. All we need to know."\r\n\r\n"Then you\'ll arrest him?" the boss of the state larder wanted to know.\r\n\r\nPardeau came to his feet. His fist slammed down on the table. "I shall\r\n_not_ arrest him--ever. When the time comes, I shall personally shoot\r\nhim down in the street like a dog. There will come a day, gentlemen,\r\nwhen you will witness this act of vengeance--when I shall make such an\r\nexample of Lenster-Hillerman as the resistance will not forget--a\r\nmorale-crumbling example, I promise you."\r\n\r\n"--in which Lenster and his ilk are forever crushed and beaten," the\r\nspeaker said.\r\n\r\nBlanchard took the floor. "Gentlemen--I move a vote of thanks and\r\nconfidence for our colleague, Neal Pardeau."\r\n\r\nThe Director of Public Security stood at attention and assayed a sharp,\r\nmilitary bow. It was a moment of rare triumph. "Thank you, gentlemen,"\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn hour later, Lenster-Pardeau was alone in his apartments. He stripped\r\noff his uniform with an air of grim satisfaction. While he undressed, he\r\nthought of the martyrs to the Cause; the men who had died. He thought of\r\nWyckoff and wished Wyckoff could have had the pleasure of knowing who\r\nhad usurped the body of Neal Pardeau--Pardeau the Butcher--the infamous\r\nPardeau.\r\n\r\nFrom the speaker came the third and final rebroadcast of Cargill\'s\r\nspeech:\r\n\r\n"--a clean and wholesome land--"\r\n\r\n"A clean and wholesome land," Lenster murmured, and the tone of his\r\nvoice was a prayer.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _If Worlds of Science Fiction_\r\n    September 1952.
