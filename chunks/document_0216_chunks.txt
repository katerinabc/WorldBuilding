]\r\n\r\n\r\nKlon fled from fern to fern like a drifting shadow, circling the new\r\nclearing that had been torn in the steamy jungle by the gleaming\r\nmonster that had come from the eternal fog that clothed his world. He\r\nhalted now and then, slipped into the stagnant water that covered nine\r\ntenths of the planet, and listened for the slightest sound that would\r\nwarn him of a hidden watcher spying on his movements.\r\n\r\nSatisfied that he was alone in the jungle swamp, he edged closer to the\r\nclearing whose edge was a charred and ragged circle. His lidless eye\r\ngleamed phosphorescently in the darkness that never changed, bringing\r\ninto sharp detail the shadows that were two shades of blackness for\r\nthere were no colors on his earth.\r\n\r\nHe slipped over the burned ground, wincing at the bruises given him by\r\nthe unaccustomed hardness beneath his body. He hissed a bit in anger\r\nthat he should suffer so, then went rigid as the thing happened again.\r\n\r\nAn amazingly light shadow had suddenly come into being on the roundness\r\nof the gleaming visitor from somewhere above.\r\n\r\nKlon wanted that shadow, wanted that thing that was brighter than\r\nanything he had ever seen--and his purpose was to gain it in any way\r\npossible. For possession of that light shadow would make him greater\r\nthan anyone else on the planet. Mightier even than Valok.\r\n\r\nKlon knew that his time was growing short; the nation would declare\r\ntheir new leader within a very short while, and he knew that possession\r\nof that light shadow was the one thing that would assure him of victory\r\nover his rival for leadership.\r\n\r\nHis gills opened and closed automatically, involuntary muscles working\r\neven when his lungs worked on the damp air. He winced a bit from the\r\nlightness of the shadow, for never had his eye seen one that was so\r\nwithout blackness.\r\n\r\nAnd then Klon was at the roundness of the thing, the touch of its\r\ncoolness sending a thrill of dread through his heart. He moved slowly\r\nuntil he was just below the circle of lightness, then climbed upwards\r\nwith his sucker-discs.\r\n\r\nSlowly, carefully, instantly ready for flight to safety, he lifted his\r\nhead until his eye was pressed against the light shadow. He felt tiny\r\npains running through his eye, back into his head, and down into his\r\nbody, but he gave it no heed.\r\n\r\nFor he was seeing something that none other of his race had had the\r\ncourage to face. He saw things but dimly, and the hideousness of the\r\nscene almost made him lose his hold.\r\n\r\nFor nightmarish creatures moved within the gleaming thing, moving on\r\nstiff tentacles, gesturing with others, while above, on a thin neck,\r\nfanged mouths opened and closed in sickening motions. And the shadows\r\nof their skins were of shades of lightness and darkness that were\r\nterrifying to Klon\'s senses that had never met the like before.\r\n\r\nHe gasped audibly, swung back from the circle of lightness, shaking\r\nwith horror at what he had seen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nInside the gleaming space ship, three men were seated on the\r\ncollapsible bunks. Kurt Overland, his muscular body unclad except for\r\nshorts, was speaking in his even tone.\r\n\r\n"Well," he said cheerfully, even his steady voice failing to conceal\r\nthe burning eagerness within him, "we\'re finally ready. I\'ve just made\r\nthe last repair on the things broken by landing."\r\n\r\nFrank Barker grinned at him from across the cell-like room, stretched\r\nhis six feet of blond-topped, lanky strength happily.\r\n\r\n"Suits me," he said, "I\'m tired of being cooped in this animated bullet\r\nthat\'s been home for so long."\r\n\r\n"We had to wait," gray-haired Professor Kent said mildly, "After all,\r\nif we are met by hostile beings, we want to be able to escape."\r\n\r\nKurt Overland grinned. "Maybe you\'re right, Professor," he said. "But\r\nI\'d hate to return to Earth and say that we\'d been run off before we\r\nhad a chance to bring back proof of our expedition\'s success."\r\n\r\n"That would be a calamity," Barker broke in. "Remember what a devil of\r\na time we had getting permission to make this flight through space.\r\nThe President told me, just before we took off, that because of the\r\nmany deaths in faulty rockets a law was being passed to forbid any more\r\nflights. He said that it was only his influence that made it possible\r\nfor us to leave Earth on a trip to Venus, and that if we failed to make\r\ngood there would probably be no more flights for, possibly, hundreds of\r\nyears."\r\n\r\n"So!" Professor Kent nodded his head. "Then I am glad that we did not\r\nfail; for it is apparent that we are the vanguard of a new phase of our\r\ncivilization."\r\n\r\nKurt Overland stood, flexed his arms. "Well, come on, let\'s go," he\r\nsaid. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
"It\'s time we took a look around."\r\n\r\nThe three of them slipped into their space suits, each of them\r\ntight-breathed with eagerness to explore the second of the planets.\r\nThey were strangely silent as they dressed.\r\n\r\n"Better slip the cover over that radi-light," Professor Kent tried to\r\nkeep his tone even. "There may be poisonous insects outside that would\r\nbe attracted by it. We will go outside without lights, then switch them\r\non when the port is closed."\r\n\r\nFrank Barker moved toward the radi-light, slipped the cover over its\r\neternal brightness with a gloved hand. Then he joined the other two\r\nat the port. For a long second the three of them stood shoulder to\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n"Professor Kent," Kurt Overland said softly, "please go first. It is\r\nyour right that you should be the first to step onto a world made\r\naccessible only by your genius."\r\n\r\nProfessor Albert Kent\'s shoulders shook silently for a moment in great\r\nemotion, then straightened with pride. He nodded, swung shut his visor\r\nplate, dogged it securely.\r\n\r\nBarker and Overland followed suit, clicked on their radio receivers.\r\nThey waited patiently for their leader, knowing the feelings that must\r\nhave been his at the moment.\r\n\r\nAnd then, unsealing the port, clutching the American flag gently in\r\nhis left hand ready for its planting on Venus, Professor Kent stepped\r\nthrough the port, the first human to land on the veiled planet. Behind\r\nhim, following with a clumsy speed, came Frank Barker and Kurt Overland.\r\n\r\n"We three--" Professor Albert Kent began.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKlon dropped from the side of the ship.\r\n\r\nHe paused for a moment over the lifeless bodies of the three intrepid\r\nexplorers, then moved away, disgusted by his closeness to the horrible\r\ncreatures he had slain so swiftly and casually.\r\n\r\nHis every sense was alert for the slightest movement on the long\r\ngleaming thing beside him to retaliate in quick vengeance for the\r\nslaying of the things that lived within its belly.\r\n\r\nKlon crouched there for moments, then moved toward the ship. He climbed\r\ninto the port entrance, leaving a thick trail of slime in his wake. He\r\nmoved eagerly toward the small hole in the opposite wall, his heart\r\nthudding with bursting eagerness.\r\n\r\nHe had seen Frank Barker slip the shield over the shadow that was so\r\nunlike anything on his earth. And now he moved through the darkness of\r\nthe space ship, slipping surely through a darkness that was natural to\r\nhim and his fellow creatures.\r\n\r\nHe lifted the small box from its recess, turned and sped from the ship,\r\nvague terror and superstition overcoming the courage that had taken\r\nso long to build to a white heat. He rushed past the men who slept\r\nthe eternal sleep before the port of their ship, slipped into the\r\nwarm water at the edge of the clearing, began his long journey to the\r\nmeeting place at which a leader would be chosen.\r\n\r\nHe clasped the box close to him as he raced through the swampy jungle,\r\nafraid that it might disappear before he could reach his destination.\r\nHe did not pause to examine his prize, knowing that the time was\r\ngrowing short, feeling certain a longer wait would only make the globe\r\nof lightness more thrilling.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe people of Klon\'s nation were gathered in the Council Clearing,\r\nsilent as each of the candidates for leader extolled his own virtues\r\nand explained his qualification for the position as their leader.\r\n\r\nHisses of approval and sounds of disapproval greeted each candidate as\r\nhe placed himself on the stone at the clearing\'s center.\r\n\r\nAnd then Klon slipped into the clearing. He hissed greetings as he made\r\nhis way to the central stone. Still clutching the box tightly to his\r\nbody, he climbed to the top of the stone, faced his nation.\r\n\r\nA respectful silence fell as his powerful body loomed high in the air\r\nover the heads of his people.\r\n\r\nKlon stood for a moment, silently considering the short speech he\r\nintended to make. He caught the glance of Valok\'s eye, looked away.\r\nHis gaze travelled over the clearing, making out familiar features of\r\nhis people.\r\n\r\nThe crowd was not large, for Klon\'s nation was a small one. It was\r\nlarge in the sense that no other group on the planet was as large. And\r\nit was the only race with useful intelligence.\r\n\r\nKlon looked at his people, and pride made his heart beat even faster.\r\n\r\n"I am here to prove to you that I am the mightiest among you," he\r\nhissed. "I have here the thing that will prove what I say." 

=== Chunk 4 ===
He lifted\r\nthe small box so that everyone could see.\r\n\r\nA wave of interested hissing grew in sudden applause, then a respectful\r\nsilence fell again. Klon hesitated for a moment longer, then continued:\r\n\r\n"I got this thing from the belly of the thing that came from the\r\nclouds, killing three horrible creatures single-handedly. Thus I have\r\nproved that I am clever, brave and strong."\r\n\r\n"What is this thing you have brought us, Brave Klon?" Valok\'s sneering\r\nhiss broke in upon Klon\'s words.\r\n\r\n"A thing that is like nothing any of you have ever seen; it is a shadow\r\nlighter than anything on this world," Klon said proudly, and placed the\r\nsmall box on the rock beside himself.\r\n\r\nHe paused again, knowing the effect his wait would have on his\r\naudience. And then he whisked the cover from the radi-light, slid from\r\nthe central stone.\r\n\r\nThe radi-light flared with a dazzling, gleaming whiteness on the\r\nstone, bringing with it a light such as had never penetrated the\r\nalways-present clouds that veiled Venus. Klon stood proudly to one\r\nside, drinking in the hissing applause and hisses of surprise and awe\r\nthat greeted his showing of the globe of light shadow. He knew then\r\nthat he had won the coveted leadership of his nation.\r\n\r\n"This," he hissed over the uproar of his people, "is the--"\r\n\r\nKlon gasped in sudden intolerable agony, fiery fingers of pain tearing\r\nat every bit of his body, cutting off his speech almost at its very\r\ninception. He crumpled slowly to the ground, dimly conscious that other\r\ncries were echoing his own.\r\n\r\nHe died then, hearing the agonized hisses of his friends, his last\r\nsight of life being that of the globe that burned with a white-hot\r\nlight on the top of the central stone.\r\n\r\nAnd slowly, but with increasing speed, his people died too. They fell\r\nlike tiny trees before a huge storm, falling even as they tried to find\r\na reason for the death around them. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Like a wave eddying out from the\r\ncentral stone, death cut its merciless sweep.\r\n\r\nAnd within seconds there was no life in the clearing. Within seconds\r\nan entire nation, every intelligent being on Venus, was dead of the\r\nunleashed light rays, the like of which had never penetrated the miles\r\nof fog that lay between earth and the sun.\r\n\r\nThe radi-light gleamed brightly on the central stone, shedding radiance\r\nover the last beings of intelligence ever to be on Venus--perhaps\r\nforever!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s The Victory of Klon, by Wilbur S.
