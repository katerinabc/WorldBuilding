]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt took me less than three thousand years to catch up with Pop; which,\r\nall things considered, was pretty good going. I came out of overdrive\r\nat 018970 hours in orbit around an ugly-looking A3-type planet, and\r\nthere was his ship below me.\r\n\r\nI slammed my cruiser down right alongside--hard enough to pulverize a\r\ncouple of feet of basalt and make Pop and his ship bounce a little.\r\nHe\'d put me to quite a bit of trouble and I was annoyed.\r\n\r\nPop got to his feet and stood there looking kind of sheepish as I\r\nclimbed out of the cruiser. The old fool had his helmet off and was\r\nbreathing in the foul atmosphere as if it were health gas. His gills\r\nhad begun to turn a little blue from the methane and CO2. He was a\r\ncharacter all right.\r\n\r\nHis name wasn\'t really Pop, of course. I guess the nickname had been\r\ntacked on because he was such an eccentric, old codger, and because\r\nhe looked like a couple of billion years old. Actually, of course, he\r\nwasn\'t nearly that old.\r\n\r\n"Welcome aboard planet," he said. "I kind of figured you\'d be along\r\nsooner or later. Or someone like you."\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m here," I said. He looked harmless, but I kept a 201R\r\nprojector on him just in case. Pop had given Security Division a lot of\r\ntrouble, and I had strict orders.\r\n\r\nI crawled over to his ship and slid inside. The cabin looked neat\r\nenough, but the old fool had so much junk crammed into the ship you\r\ncould hardly turn around. I found what I was looking for toward the\r\nbow--row after row of cylindrical canisters. I broke one open and the\r\nbio-detector on my back began to stutter like crazy. I dropped it and\r\nsprayed them all until they glowed dull green. By then the contents\r\nwere cooked.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPop was still standing in the same place when I crawled out, looking as\r\ncasual as you please. He only had a few eyes on me. Most of them he had\r\nturned toward the planet\'s oversize satellite and a raw, angry-looking\r\nsea that was breaking a few ship\'s-lengths away.\r\n\r\n"How\'d you catch up with me?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Space warp. You left a trail a child could follow." I moved around\r\nhis ship and found the reason he was looking so innocent. He\'d already\r\nset up one of his canisters and the seal was about to break. I sprayed\r\nit. So much for several billion one-celled forms of life bottled under\r\npressure.\r\n\r\n"All right," I said. "That\'s the last of them. Let\'s get going."\r\n\r\n"Okay," said Pop. "Never argue with Security Division. Still, you\'ve\r\ngot to admit I gave you a good run for your money. And I seeded quite\r\na mess of planets."\r\n\r\nI shouldn\'t have done it, but I was angry. I snapped a claw across his\r\nnerve center before he could draw it back into his shell. It must have\r\nhurt plenty, because ten or twelve of his eyes began to water.\r\n\r\n"Seeded, hell!" I said. "You touched down on exactly 9080 planets, and\r\nI sterilized every one of them after you left. That\'s what took me so\r\nlong."\r\n\r\nHe seemed to shrink a little inside, and for the first time I realized\r\njust how old the nut really was.\r\n\r\n"All that time," he said. "All that effort wasted. Damn. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Double damn."\r\n\r\n"You should have figured that in the first place," I said. "Central\r\nMaxim 0438 clearly states that no life is to be introduced into the\r\nouter galaxies. And don\'t ask me why. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
I\'m no biologist. I just follow\r\norders."\r\n\r\n"Listen," said Pop. "_Please_ listen. Back at Central Galaxy they think\r\nwe--our race--is pretty much immortal. But they don\'t _know_. They\r\ndon\'t know for sure if _any_ life will be left in our galaxy after two\r\nor three hundred wars like the last one and--"\r\n\r\n"Hold it," I said. "You\'re wasting your time. I\'m not a philosopher and\r\nyou know it."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right," said Pop. "And you\'re not a biologist, either. You\r\ntold me." He waved a claw in gesture of resignation number seven.\r\n"Well, maybe you\'re right. Maybe I have been an old fool. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Let\'s go\r\nhome. No use hanging around an ugly planet like this one." He made\r\ngesture of contempt number fifteen.\r\n\r\nWell, I thought, that\'s a relief. Maybe the old geezer wasn\'t as crazy\r\nas I\'d figured. Maybe he just needed some sense slapped into him. At\r\nany rate, he didn\'t make any trouble when I disintegrated his ship--the\r\nold crate wasn\'t spaceworthy to begin with--and he climbed into my\r\ncruiser meek as could be.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI put the drive in low and pulled out of the system. The next\r\nplanet--Pop had landed on the third--was going through G14\r\ndisintegration into asteroids, but I eased through without any trouble\r\nand began to pick up speed.\r\n\r\nJust then Pop swung around in his seat and made good-luck gesture eight\r\nand long-life gesture twelve toward the planet we\'d left.\r\n\r\nI stared at him. "I don\'t get it," I said. "Just a while ago you\r\nagreed that was an ugly hunk of rock. You even made contempt gesture\r\nfifteen--you spat on it."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right," said Pop. "I did, didn\'t I? Right into a pool of\r\nbrackish water." Then he began to chuckle. He kept on chuckling for\r\nfive years, until I got annoyed and slapped his nerve center again.\r\n\r\nAside from that, the return voyage was uneventful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
