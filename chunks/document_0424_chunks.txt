But suppose some of our Extraterrestrial\r\n    neighbors are also a bit touchy?_\r\n\r\n\r\n  reel\r\n  life\r\n films\r\n\r\n _by ... Jacques Jean Ferrat_\r\n\r\n\r\n Pity the poor purveyor of mere entertainment in today\'s world.\r\n He can\'t afford to offend a soul, yet must have a villain.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwenty-five years ago Cyril Bezdek and E. Carter Dorwin would have met\r\nin a private railway car belonging to one of them. They might even have\r\nmet in a private train. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
At any rate they would have met in absolute\r\nprivacy. But it being the present, they had to be content with a series\r\nof adjoining rooms taking up less than one half of a car on the\r\nSuper-Sachem, fastest coast-to-coast train in the country.\r\n\r\nTheir meeting in private was very important. Upon its results hinged the\r\nfuture of Gigantic Studios, one of Hollywood\'s big three production\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\nDorwin was the powerful plenipotentiary of the Consolidated Trust\r\nCompany of Manhattan and backer of Gigantic\'s multimillion-dollar\r\nproductions. He was on his way West to make sure that the interests of\r\nhis bank were being adequately served by the studio.\r\n\r\nBezdek was Gigantic\'s supreme production boss. Former office boy,\r\nwriter, prop man, assistant-director, director, producer, and story\r\neditor, he was the works--unless Dorwin decided otherwise during this\r\nmeeting and pulled the props out from under him. He had thought Dorwin\'s\r\ntrip sufficiently important to fly to Kansas City and get aboard the\r\nSuper-Sachem to be with the banker during the remainder of his trip.\r\n\r\nThey had dined in the privacy of Dorwin\'s suite--Bezdek as befitted his\r\ntortured duodenum on yogurt and Melba toast--Dorwin on caviar, consomm\xc3\xa9,\r\na thick steak with full trimmings, and a golden baked Alaska accompanied\r\nby Armagnac.\r\n\r\n"How do you manage to keep thin?" Bezdek asked him, honestly envious.\r\n"Polo, tennis? Golf would never do it."\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t exercised in ten years," said the banker, biting off the end\r\nof a Havana Perfecto. He studied the little movie-maker over the flame\r\nof his lighter. Outside, the flat expanse of Kansas rushed past through\r\nthe night at close to a hundred miles an hour.\r\n\r\n"Some people are lucky," said Bezdek, adjusting the broad knot of his\r\nhand-painted Windsor tie. He was remarshaling his thoughts and ideas. It\r\nwas very important that he and Dorwin be in perfect accord before they\r\nreached Hollywood.\r\n\r\nThe banker, who was new to the movie-making branch of his business,\r\nspoke first. "I presume," he said finally, "that you\'re aware of the\r\ncurrent feeling in our New York office?"\r\n\r\nThe movie magnate gestured carelessly with a Saxony gun-club sleeve,\r\nrevealing a platinum wristwatch strap. "We hear rumors now and again,"\r\nhe said. "It\'s about our science fiction films." Bezdek avoided making\r\nit a question. He was far too shrewd for that.\r\n\r\nThe banker, finding himself thus at a disadvantage, said amicably, "It\'s\r\nnot that the fantasy series isn\'t making money, understand." He paused,\r\nlooking faintly distressed. "It\'s just that, frankly, we feel they\'re\r\ngetting too far away from reality. Trips to Mars and Venus--strange\r\ncreatures.... It\'s not real--it\'s not dignified. Frankly, we question\r\nwhether an institution like ours can afford to be connected with\r\nanything so--so ephemeral. After all ..."\r\n\r\nHe paused as sounds of a scuffle in the corridor penetrated the room and\r\nsomething or somebody was banged hard against the door. Bezdek,\r\nfrowning, jumped up nervously and went to the door, opened it, looked\r\nout.\r\n\r\n"What\'s going on out there?" he inquired tartly. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
"_Ty!_"\r\n\r\n"Sorry, Mr. Bezdek," said Ty Falter, the mogul\'s private secretary,\r\nbodyguard and constant companion. He was leaning against the far wall of\r\nthe corridor, mopping a cut lower lip with a bloody handkerchief. He was\r\na tall, deceptively sleepy-looking young man who virtually never slept.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the corridor two lesser aides were half-dragging a tall\r\nfigure between them. Bezdek frowned as he caught a glimpse of a nodding\r\nhead in half profile--a near-perfect profile which showed no sign of a\r\nbruise.\r\n\r\n"How did that creep get in here?" he snapped. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
"That\'s the same character\r\nwho tried to nail me at the K.C. airport."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," said Ty Falter apologetically. He glanced at his skinned\r\nknuckles. "It was like hitting a brick," he said. He shook his head,\r\nadded, "Sorry, Mr. Bezdek. I don\'t know how he got in here."\r\n\r\n"Your job is to keep crackpots like that away from me," said the mogul.\r\nHe turned and went back inside the compartment. Dorwin was still sitting\r\nas before.\r\n\r\n"Eavesdroppers?" the banker inquired with unruffled poise.\r\n\r\n"Not likely," said Bezdek, dropping into his seat. "Probably a\r\nmovie-crazy kid trying to chisel a screen test."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe incident had brought back his heartburn. He wanted to take a couple\r\nof his pills but not in front of Dorwin. The banker might think he was\r\ncracking up. These damned New Yorkers had no idea of the pressure under\r\nwhich he labored. He sipped a glass of flat soda water.\r\n\r\n"Where were we?" Dorwin said quietly. Somehow to Bezdek he gave the\r\nimpression of remorseless rationality. "Oh, yes, these fantasy\r\nmovies--we\'re a little worried about them."\r\n\r\n"I thought you might be," said Bezdek, leaning forward and using the\r\nfull magnetism of his personality. Now that the issue was out in the\r\nopen his discomfort was eased. "Actually we don\'t think of our\r\ninterplanetary cycle as fantasy, Dorwin. We think of them as forecasts\r\nof the future, as prophecy."\r\n\r\n"They\'re still a far cry from reality, or even the usual escapism," said\r\nthe banker. "Confidentially, I happen to _know_ that it will be\r\nyears--perhaps decades--before we make any live contact with the other\r\nplanets. Our national interests demand that we prevent atomic power from\r\nsuperseding older methods before investments have realized on their\r\nholdings to the fullest extent. And it is upon development of atomic\r\npower that space-flight hinges at present."\r\n\r\n"Certainly I understand that--sound business," said Bezdek with his\r\none-sided smile. "I hope they wait for many years."\r\n\r\nDorwin looked faintly astonished. "From these pictures of yours I must\r\nconfess I had derived a totally different impression of your theories,"\r\nhe said slowly, flicking two inches of pale grey ash into the silver\r\ntray at his elbow.\r\n\r\n"Listen to me," said the movie-maker, again leaning toward his\r\nvis-\xc3\xa0-vis. "We\'re making these pictures now because when the first man\r\nor men come back from other planets our science fiction cycle is\r\nfinished. It will cease to be _escape_. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
We will then be faced with the\r\nreality of what they really find--and that\'s bound to be a great deal\r\ndifferent from the sort of thing we\'re feeding them now."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a point I hadn\'t considered," said the banker, reaching for the\r\nbrandy. He nodded to himself as he poured it, then looked up at Bezdek\r\nand asked, "But why this--space opera is the colloquial term, I believe?\r\nWhy not stick closer to real life?"\r\n\r\nBezdek sat back and the slanting smile creased his features again.\r\n"Minorities," he said. "That\'s why. Crackpot minorities object loudly at\r\nbeing portrayed in films they don\'t like. We don\'t want to tread on\r\nanybody\'s toes--there\'s trouble enough in the world as it is. People\r\nwant villains. But unless we make our villains--even minor\r\nvillains--people from nowhere we get boycotted somewhere by somebody.\r\nAnd that costs us money."\r\n\r\n"Yes, of course," said the banker, "but I fail to see--"\r\n\r\n"It\'s simple." Bezdek was in full cry now and interrupted openly.\r\n"People like conflict in their movies. If it\'s a Western they want their\r\nheroes to fight Indians or Mexicans or rustlers. The Indians and\r\nMexicans object to being the villains and they\'ve got big sympathetic\r\nfollowings. Okay, so we use rustlers or renegade white men and we still\r\nmake Westerns--but not many. No plot variety."\r\n\r\nHe sipped more soda water. "It\'s the same with everything else. Unless\r\nwe\'re in a war with a legitimate enemy to hate we can\'t use villains.\r\nIt\'s almost enough to make a man wish--"\r\n\r\n"Not with the H-bomb, Bezdek," said Dorwin frigidly.\r\n\r\n"Of course not--I was only speaking figuratively," said the movie-maker\r\nhastily. "I\'m as much against war as anyone. But that\'s what makes these\r\ninterplanetary movies great stuff. We can run in all the villains we\r\nwant--make them just as bad as we want. Audiences really like to have\r\nsomeone they can hate."\r\n\r\n"I see," said Dorwin. He permitted himself to look faintly pleased.\r\n"After all, a Martian can hardly protest what we do with him. I see your\r\npoint now."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got it," said Bezdek, beaming now. He leaned forward and added,\r\n"Furthermore, we\'ve got four new pictures in the works for the space\r\ncycle that are really going to--"\r\n\r\nHe broke off, interrupted by a knock at the door. He stared at the\r\nbanker, seeking someone to share his annoyance, found Dorwin staring out\r\nthe window, frowning.\r\n\r\n"The train seems to have stopped," said the banker.\r\n\r\nBezdek turned to the window. It was true. The night was clouded and\r\ndark but he could make out a single tree in faint silhouette and it was\r\nnot moving. The knock on the stateroom door came again.\r\n\r\n"I\'d better see who it is," said Bezdek, rising. "Maybe something is\r\nwrong.

=== Chunk 6 ===
"\r\n\r\nHe opened the door quickly--all but fell back into his seat. The tall\r\nyoung man with the too-perfect features--the man who had tried in vain\r\nto speak to him at the Kansas City airport, who had been forcibly\r\nevicted earlier from the car--stood there!\r\n\r\nThe young man smiled and it was much too cold to be ingratiating if that\r\nwas its intent. He said, looking down on both men, "I think you will\r\nwish to talk to me now."\r\n\r\nThe sheer effrontery of it rendered Cyril Bezdek speechless for the\r\nfirst time in years. Looking past the intruder through the angle of the\r\nopen door he could see Ty Falter sitting on the corridor floor, leaning\r\nagainst the wall. His eyes were closed, his head canted at an odd angle.\r\n\r\nIt was Dorwin who first found words. "Who are you?" 

=== Chunk 7 ===
he inquired. "What\r\ndo you want?"\r\n\r\n"I am from Mars," said the stranger. "I have come here to enter a\r\nprotest against the manner in which Mr. Bezdek\'s motion pictures are\r\nportraying my people."\r\n\r\nThe movie-maker\'s mouth dropped open. He closed it quickly, glanced\r\nacross at the banker, saw equal bewilderment on that usually poker-face.\r\nOn impulse, Bezdek reached for the buzzer that would summon aid and\r\npressed it firmly several times.\r\n\r\n"No one will answer," said the intruder in a voice remarkable not for\r\nits accent but for its lack of any. "We have been forced to--to\r\nimmobilize this train in order to see you. It has been very difficult to\r\nreach you, Mr. Bezdek, I am sure through no fault of your own. But the\r\npeople of my planet feel very strongly about this matter and I must get\r\nsome satisfaction for them."\r\n\r\n"So help me," said the mogul, his thin face purple with anger, "if this\r\nis a gag I\'ll see you jailed for it! And before you\'re jailed you\'re\r\ngoing to have a very unpleas--"\r\n\r\n"No, Mr. Bezdek--Mr. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
Dorwin--this is not a joke. We of Mars are proud of\r\nour culture, our civilization. We do not like being portrayed as evil\r\nand ridiculous creatures. We\'re not like those filthy Venerians. We\r\nMartians have a great self-respect."\r\n\r\n"_Ostrich feathers!_" Bezdek roared at the dead-panned intruder. "You\r\nmay not be aware of it but there are severe penalties for holding up a\r\ntrain on this--in this country. You can\'t go around slugging people\r\neither. Look at Ty out there."\r\n\r\n"Your servant will be all right," said the intruder, "as will the others\r\naboard this train. I can release them whenever you agree that my mission\r\nis to be taken seriously."\r\n\r\n"All right," said Bezdek, whose mind was nothing if not acrobatic.\r\n"Suppose you are from Mars. Tell me why your people object to our\r\nmovies. Surely they aren\'t seeing them on Mars?"\r\n\r\n"No. But your Earthmen will reach our planet soon and your opinion of us\r\nwill be shaped in some degree by these movies they have seen. And since\r\nthe relationships of the near-future are of vital import to us now we\r\nmust not be represented as other than we are. Such misconceptions could\r\nbreed interplanetary war." He shuddered.\r\n\r\n"I think you\'re crazy!" 

=== Chunk 9 ===
said Bezdek. He turned to the banker, who was\r\nagain staring out the window.\r\n\r\n"There\'s something out there--look," said Dorwin.\r\n\r\n"That is our ship," the intruder told them blandly. "That is why we\r\nstopped the train here. It is the only flat area sufficiently unsettled\r\nfor our landing and departure without detection. We must return at once\r\nor lose perihelion."\r\n\r\n"Let me see," said Bezdek. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
He peered through the window. There _was_\r\nsomething out there--something black and vague and shaped like an\r\nimmense turtle with jagged projections. He tried to tell himself he was\r\nseeing things, failed.\r\n\r\n"Amazing!" said E. Carter Dorwin. "It\'s utterly amazing!"\r\n\r\n"Incredible is the word for it," Bezdek said wearily. He faced the\r\nintruder, said bluntly, "Very well, you say you\'re from Mars. And I say\r\nto your face that you aren\'t!"\r\n\r\n"You seem remarkably sure, Mr. Bezdek."\r\n\r\n"And why not?" The movie-maker was in his element now, delivering the\r\nclincher in an argument. "Our scientists have proved conclusively that\r\nEarthmen cannot exist on Mars without space-suits. You say you\'re a\r\nMartian. Yet you look like one of us. So if you can live on Mars, how\r\ncan you live in our atmosphere without a space-suit of some sort?\r\nThere\'s one for you to answer!" He chortled.\r\n\r\n"But I _am_ wearing protection--a protective suit arranged to give the\r\nimpression that I am an Earthman." A flicker of something akin to\r\ndistaste passed over his singularly immobile face.\r\n\r\n"I\'d like to see what you _do_ look like," said Dorwin, suddenly\r\nentering into the eerie conversation.\r\n\r\nSomething like a sigh escaped the intruder. Then he said, "Very well. It\r\nis important that you believe me, so--" His hands went to the top of his\r\nscalp and deliberately he peeled the life-like mask slowly from the\r\nhidden features of his thoroughly Martian face!\r\n\r\nIt was a very odd face--not at all human. It reminded Bezdek a little of\r\nan immutably sad Bassett Hound he kept in his Hollywood kennel. It made\r\nDorwin think of his mother-in-law. It was not a frightening face and the\r\nsingle eye in the center of the forehead held them with its mournful\r\nregard, held them, held them ...\r\n\r\nWhen they were thoroughly under its hypnotic spell the Martian began to\r\nspeak softly ...\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTy Falter was slow in waking up. But when he realized that he was lying\r\nthere in the corridor he came to with a start. If Bezdek ever found out\r\nabout this he\'d be cooked as far as Hollywood went!\r\n\r\nHe got to his feet, his unsteadiness helped not at all by the fact that\r\nthe train chose that moment to start with a jerk. He grabbed at the wall\r\nas a meteor flashed through the dark of the Kansas night outside the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\nFunny, he thought, the damned thing was going _up_, not _down_. But he\r\nforgot about the meteor as he heard the voices coming from the stateroom\r\nhe was being paid to guard. He reeled over to the partly opened door and\r\nlistened.\r\n\r\nBezdek was talking volubly, enthusiastically as he did when he spoke of\r\nthe actual making of a picture. "... so we\'ll only have to reshoot a few\r\nsequences, Dorwin. The cost will be nothing compared to the returns.\r\nThink of it! Our space-pilot hero crashes on _Venus_. He has to fight\r\nhorrible slimy swamp creatures--we can make them look like crocodiles\r\nwith six or eight legs--to reach the mountaintop where the girl is\r\nhiding ..."\r\n\r\nHe paused and Dorwin said gravely, "I\'m glad, since these space operas\r\nseem to be necessary, that you have decided to locate them on a _real_\r\nplanet like Venus rather than a _fictitious_ one like Mars. If minority\r\npressure groups force us to use fantasy then it is as well to stay as\r\ncredible as possible."\r\n\r\n"Right, Dorwin! 

=== Chunk 11 ===
Right on the nose!" cried Bezdek. "And we can make real\r\nvillains out of these Venerians, real bang-up nasty heavies!"\r\n\r\nThe banker\'s voice came through the door again. He said doubtfully, "But\r\nhow can we be sure about the Venerians ..."\r\n\r\n"Because I can feel it _here_!" cried the movie-maker. The thump that\r\naccompanied his final word told Ty that his boss had smote himself\r\ndramatically over the heart as he delivered the climactic line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ May 1954.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.
