But if there is one event that\r\nstands out in my perfect memory that can still raise a goosebump or two\r\non my broad tanned shoulders, the event is when I went hunting for the\r\nflying tuskers of K\'niik-K\'naak. There we were, myself and my faithful\r\nold purple Andromedan guide, Mimp, out in the vast blue-white desert of\r\nPolaris III, looking for the flying tuskers.\r\n\r\nK\'niik-K\'naak, the region we trod, was much feared by the Polaris III\r\nnatives. They were a superstitious bunch anyway, who panicked at the\r\nvery thought of being trampled or gored, and never ventured into the\r\nregion of the tuskers. I, a man of clear head and no nonsense, laughed\r\nat their primitive fancies. I set out nonetheless into the desert, with\r\nonly the barest rudiments necessary for survival. We could get none of\r\nthe local boys for bearers, so Mimp had to carry everything. Naturally\r\nI had to have both hands free to use my Moxley .55, the best ray-rifle\r\nyou can buy anywhere in the colonized universe.\r\n\r\nAside from the ray-rifle, I carried nothing save a fourteen-inch\r\ncarbon-steel bolo knife slung to my belt, my ever-present calabash\r\npipe, crammed full of steaming Yekkweed--expensive to have imported\r\nfrom the Martian canals, but I buy it by the carton--and my trusty\r\nf9-ultiflex binoculars on a short platinum chain.\r\n\r\nMimp struggled along behind me as we set off into the desert. Even his\r\nmighty plum-hued muscles quivered under the load of our gear, which\r\nincluded an inflatable pseudolog hut (with fireplace, an optional\r\nextra), a double-oven radium-powered cookout stove and a seven-pound\r\ncrate of signal flares, just in case we got lost.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThree days we ranged the shifting blue-white sands of K\'niik-K\'naak,\r\nwatching everywhere for signs of the herd we\'d heard occurred in that\r\nregion. Nothing.\r\n\r\n"Keep sharp lookout," I snapped at Mimp, over my shoulder. Mimp was\r\nlike a brother, but you have to keep these aliens in their place.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Bwana," said Mimp. (He called me Bwana, always.) "Soon we come to\r\nwaterhole."\r\n\r\nI didn\'t ask him how he knew. Andromedans have a knack for geography.\r\nIn many ways, they\'re almost as good as an Earthman. "Good," was all I\r\nanswered. It was short, to the point, and showed who was boss.\r\n\r\nOnward we trekked, a sunburnt duo casting long bronze shadows across\r\nthe burning sands of K\'niik K\'naak. A thin plume of Yekkweed fumes\r\nmarked our passage. It was nearly sunset when we spotted the pink\r\nglitter of that sickening slop that is the Polaris III excuse for\r\nwater. I stood watching the sunset, while Mimp unloaded all the gear\r\nand began to set up camp. As the last rays faded in the sky, I turned\r\nand entered the pseudolog hut Mimp had inflated. Hard on his lungs, of\r\ncourse, but I hadn\'t wanted to burden him with the extra weight of a\r\nhand-pump. I\'m a stern man, but I\'m fair.\r\n\r\nHe had my slippers laid out beside the armchair by the fire and a cool\r\nmint julep awaiting me on the small teakwood taboret. He was busying\r\nhimself in the kitchenette, whipping up a quick souffle with one hand\r\nand tossing a small salad with the other.\r\n\r\n"Hurry it up there," I growled jovially. "Time is money, time is\r\nmoney!" A bit of friendly joshing is good for the relationship; shows\r\nMimp I\'m tolerant of him sharing the same quarters, without actually\r\nmaking me act like an equal, if you know what I mean.\r\n\r\n"I hurry, Sahib," said Mimp. "Coming up." 

=== Chunk 2 ===
(He always called me Sahib.)\r\nHe rushed across the room and began setting the table, with my\r\npearl-handled silverware.\r\n\r\n"No, not there," I yawned, picking up my julep and settling back into\r\nthe armchair. "I think I\'d like the table nearer the piano, so you can\r\nplay Chopin Nocturnes while I dine." I added, as a kindly afterthought,\r\n"You can reheat your share of the souffle later, after I\'ve gone to\r\nbed." Personally, I hate cold souffle.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Effendi," said Mimp. (He always called me Effendi.) Rapidly, he\r\nmoved the table over to the Steinway, set out the finished souffle\r\nand salad and then hurried to the piano and began laboriously plunking\r\nout glorious melody. I took a sip of my julep, then spat it out on the\r\ncarpet.\r\n\r\n"Mimp!" I roared, incensed. "Did you make this drink with Polaris III\r\nwater?"\r\n\r\nCraven and cowering, he fell at my feet, whining for mercy. But I was\r\nadamant. You let an alien take an inch, and the next thing, he\'s swiped\r\na parsec. "The knout," I said, keeping my voice emotionless and holding\r\nout my hand.\r\n\r\n"Please, Kimosabe," whimpered Mimp, "I dared not use the water in\r\nthe canteens. You know that Polaris III water is poisonous to us\r\nAndromedans, while you Earthmen can tolerate it."\r\n\r\n"I can _not_!" 

=== Chunk 3 ===
I raged.\r\n\r\n"I was speaking medically," he mewed piteously.\r\n\r\n"And I, esthetically," I snarled. "The knout, now, and be quick about\r\nit."\r\n\r\nHe scurried on all fours to the bureau where I kept my odds and ends,\r\nand came crawling back with the brutal leather whip. I weighed the\r\ninfraction, decided that three stripes should be lesson enough and I\r\nlaid them onto his bare back with a steady hand. "Now," I said, wearied\r\nby the effort, "play something gay and lilting."\r\n\r\nHastily, he dragged himself to the Steinway and complied. Dinner was\r\nreally delicious.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNext morning, before sun-up, we lay in wait for the herd behind a\r\nrock beside the waterhole. The sky was growing pale saffron near the\r\nhorizon, then light yellow, and finally glaring brass as the sun arose.\r\n(By "sun," I mean the star Polaris, of course. Our sun is a star, you\r\nknow. Or did you? 

=== Chunk 4 ===
_I_ knew, naturally.) Then, afar off, I espied the\r\nbulky blobs in the sky that were the flying tuskers of K\'niik-K\'naak.\r\nNo man had ever hunted one before. I felt pretty proud, let me tell you.\r\n\r\nOnward they came through the air, their large skin-type gray wings\r\nflapping stolidly up and down, about three strokes to the mile.\r\nEnormous creatures they were, with fiery little eyes, and long trailing\r\ntrunks that had a wicked little hook at the tip. But the thing that\r\nreally caught one\'s eye was their tusks. Ten of them. Eight originating\r\nin the mouth, and one in either fore-knee. Each tusk was seven feet\r\nin length, long, white, straight-tapered and flawless. But not ivory,\r\nnot on these babies. Pure pearl. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
That lovely lustrous calcareous\r\nconcretion! Each tusk would bring fifty thousand interplanetary credits\r\non the open market. And there were ten per elephantine beast, and at\r\nleast sixty of them in the herd.\r\n\r\n"Look at that, will you!" I cried to Mimp. "Look, feast your ugly eyes\r\non that gleaming fortune swooping down upon us, Mimp!"\r\n\r\n"I look, I feast," he murmured servilely, huddled behind me behind the\r\nrock behind the tree. Aliens tend to be cowardly when their lives are\r\nin danger.\r\n\r\nCarefully, I raised the rifle and took a bead on the youngest beast in\r\nthat descending herd. It\'s slightly illegal to shoot the fledglings,\r\nbut after all, I wasn\'t going to bring him _back_ with me, so no one\r\nwould know. It\'s just that I find that when I shoot the eldest in a\r\nherd of wildlife, the others miss their protector and flee. But if I\r\nshoot one of the babies, the elder ones stay around to protect it, and\r\nI get to kill lots more. Nasty, perhaps, but that\'s the hunting game\r\nfor you.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, I took this bead on the beast. I was just in the act of\r\ndepressing the firing stud when an unwonted lightness in the weapon\r\ncaught my attention. Irritated, I cracked open the firing chamber.\r\n"_Mimp!_" I growled, in one of my rare real wraths. "You didn\'t _load_\r\nthe ray-rifle! Even a Moxley .55 is no damned good without cartridges!"\r\n\r\n"A thousand pardons, boss," muttered Mimp, inclining his loathsome\r\nlavender face in a subservient bow. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
"I go get."\r\n\r\nHe wriggled away across the sand and into the hut, fortunately not\r\ndisturbing the herd, which was now kneeling on the slope above\r\nthe waterhole and inhaling that putrid pink liquid through their\r\ntrunks. I drooled a bit, seeing the rainbow glint of sunlight on\r\nthose magnificent tusks. Seconds passed, then minutes. The herd was\r\npractically slaked, and still no crawling Mimp reappeared from the hut.\r\n\r\nSoon they\'d fly off, and cost me a fortune.\r\n\r\nI was already pretty much in hock after paying the fare to Polaris\r\nIII from Earth. (I\'d been able to save a little by listing Mimp as\r\nbaggage, and storing him in the hold for the flight.) Angry, irked, and\r\npretty well enraged, I moved swiftly toward the hut on hands and knees,\r\nscuttling in the doorway as fast as I could, lest the herd see me and\r\nflee, or attack.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the parlor, I stood erect, and glanced about. There was no one in\r\nsight, but the back door was open. "_Mimp!_" I bellowed, stamping\r\nacross the carpet. "Where are you, you off-color blemish!?" No reply.\r\n"This means six stripes with the knout!" I warned him.\r\n\r\nThen I heard a faint sound, not unlike that of a fourteen-inch bolo\r\nknife being brought down hard upon the inflating-valve of a pseudolog\r\nhut. I felt at my belt. My bolo was missing. "Mimp!" I hollered, much\r\ntoo late.\r\n\r\nThen the whole damned room, piano, fireplace, carpet, armchair and all,\r\nsnapped in upon me, and I was wound up with those rubberized walls\r\ntighter than the center of a golfball. I think I must have swooned,\r\nthen.\r\n\r\nMuch, much later, by dint of tooth, fingernail and sheer grit, I\r\nhad gnawed, clawed and wrenched my way free of the collapsed hut. A\r\nstunning sight met my eyes. All about the waterhole, the flying tuskers\r\nwere still kneeling. Every one of them was dead and already beginning\r\nto rot. But the infuriating thing was that not one of them had so much\r\nas an inch of tusk any more.\r\n\r\nEvery beast had been detusked, the priceless pearl shafts lopped off\r\nflush with the thick gray hides. _Mimp!_ And with _my_ bolo knife,\r\nalready!\r\n\r\nAt least he\'d left me a canteen. I tasted it. _Pffaugh!_ Pink Polaris\r\nIII slop! The dirty little--! 

=== Chunk 7 ===
But I saved it anyhow. I had a long\r\nlonely walk back to town ahead of me.\r\n\r\nAnd there it was that I learned even worse news.\r\n\r\nMimp had already sold the tusks and was on his way back to Andromeda,\r\nwith a fortune in his breechclout. I swore revenge, then and there,\r\nbut was unable to carry it out, since I was short the rocketfare back\r\nto Earth and the authorities. (It seems that Polaris III is a neutral\r\nplanet. Even the mighty word "Earthman" carries no weight there.) So\r\nI had to hock the piano, my precious Moxley .55 and what could be\r\nsalvaged of the souffle, and even then I was only able to book passage\r\nas near Earth as Sirius II.\r\n\r\nLuckily, they had a consulate there. I was able to secure a ride home,\r\nafter some weeks\' wait. By then, however, it was too late to avenge\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nMimp, with his stolen fortune, had paid off his planet\'s debt to Earth.\r\nAndromeda IV (his home planet) declared its independence, and the\r\nEarth authorities throw up their hands and shrug whenever I hint at\r\nextraditing him. Seems he\'s the new emperor there, or something. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
They\r\ncan\'t afford to antagonize him. Damn!\r\n\r\nHowever, I suppose you\'re wondering just why I get goosebumps when I\r\nrecall the flying tuskers of K\'niik-K\'naak. Well, it wasn\'t so much the\r\ndanger from the beasts, nor the hideous heat of that desert, nor my\r\nlong, painful sojourn beneath the Steinway in the shrunken hut that was\r\nso bad.\r\n\r\nIt was those tuskers. Know how they died? Mimp had poisoned the\r\nwaterhole. Unsporting, and all that, but the thing that nags my brain\r\nis: Why didn\'t _I_ think of that?\r\n\r\nMe! Bested by a lousy purple alien!\r\n\r\nWhat\'s the universe coming to?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
