]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was time for the after-meal meditation. Marik, First Priest of\r\nCarthule, finished his frugal meal and went outside to sit in the\r\nmid-day breeze and watch the sands blowing gently over the bare flat\r\nplains. The problem of the Revelation occupied his reveries: why had\r\nCarthule, in His infinite wisdom, waited so long to reveal to His\r\npeople that they were not alone in the universe?\r\n\r\nMarik looked up at the glowing dot behind the gray wall of the sky.\r\nThat, he knew, was the Sun. And there were other planets, some\r\ninhabited, some not. Carthule was not alone; He was one of nine. And\r\nHis people had never suspected the truth until the flaming ships of the\r\nthird planet--Earth, was it?--had broken through the skies, and the\r\nsmall white people had told them of the other worlds.\r\n\r\nThe problem was one which the greatest theologians of the time--in\r\nwhose number Marik, without pride, deemed himself--had discussed at\r\ngreat length, never coming to a solution. Marik and Polla San, of the\r\nneighboring temple, had finally concluded that Carthule moved in ways\r\ntoo complex for His mortal people to understand.\r\n\r\nMarik lowered his gaze from the sky and looked out across the dry\r\nexpanse of desert. He could make out, dimly, Polla San\'s temple far\r\nacross the sands. Polla San was due to visit him shortly, he recalled.\r\nOr was it the other way around? Marik frowned; he was getting old, and\r\nsoon would have to relinquish his duties to one of the younger acolytes\r\nand spend his remaining decades sitting dreaming in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nCalmly Marik settled into the semi-somnolence of the after-meal\r\nmeditation, fixing his gaze on the far-off temple of Polla San but\r\nturning his vision inward. The sand blew in widening circles, until it\r\nseemed to Marik that there was a small, dark figure wandering out in\r\nthe desert. Sleepily he watched the circlings of the small figure as it\r\npursued a crazy path through the desert.\r\n\r\nThen perception broke through his meditation and he realized something\r\nwas in the desert that had no business there. Carefully he lifted the\r\ntransparent nictitating lid that protected his eyes from the sand and\r\nfocussed sharply on the figure in the desert.\r\n\r\nIt was an Earthman! Lost in the desert, apparently. Marik, somewhat\r\nannoyed at this interruption of his meditation, rang for Kenra Sarg.\r\n\r\nThe young acolyte appeared immediately. Marik nodded. "Look out there,"\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\nKenra Sarg turned and stared. After a moment he turned back to Marik.\r\n\r\n"That\'s an Earthman lost out there! We\'d better bring him in here\r\nbefore he gets buried by the sand. What do you say, Father?"\r\n\r\n"Of course, Kenra Sarg, of course. Bring him here."\r\n\r\nThe younger priest bowed and trotted out to the desert. Marik watched\r\nhim as he ran. He was tall and powerful, and his skin was deep blue,\r\nalmost purple. His powerful thigh muscles clenched and unclenched\r\nas he ran. _He reminds me of my younger self_, Marik thought, as he\r\nwatched Kenra Sarg pound effortlessly over the sand. _He will be a fine\r\nsuccessor when I am ready to go._\r\n\r\nHe sank back into reverie, hoping for some repose before Kenra Sarg\r\nreturned with the Earthman.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe was small, even smaller than the other Earthmen Marik had seen, and\r\nhis mouth worked curiously and constantly. His face had been dried by\r\nthe desert. He shook sand from his hair, his eyes, his ears.\r\n\r\n"I thought I was finished that time," he said, looking up into Marik\'s\r\neyes. The Earthman\'s eyes were bright and hard, and Marik found the\r\ncontact unpleasant.\r\n\r\n"You are safe here," Marik said. "This is the Temple of Carthule."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve heard of you people," the Earthman said. "Understand you\'re a\r\nsort of hotel and religion combined."\r\n\r\n"Not exactly," Marik said. "But the strongest tenet of our faith is\r\nthat the Guest Rite is inviolable. Our greatest joy is giving sanctuary\r\nto wanderers. You are welcome here so long as you care to stay."\r\n\r\nThe little Earthman nodded his head. "Sounds fine with me. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
But I won\'t\r\ntrouble you long. I was just passing through this region on my way back\r\nto New Chicago--I mean Corolla--when I got lost in your desert. Dropped\r\nmy compass in the sand and couldn\'t find my way after that."\r\n\r\n"Yes," Marik said. "It is very difficult.

=== Chunk 4 ===
"\r\n\r\n"You\'re telling me! It would not be so bad if you had stars here on\r\nVenus--Carthule, I mean--but you don\'t, and so there\'s no way to get\r\nyour direction. I could have died out there before I found my way back\r\nto Corolla. I\'m shipping back to Earth," he said. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
"I can\'t wait to get\r\nback. No disrespect meant, of course," he added cautiously.\r\n\r\nMarik looked down at the Earthman. _I\'ll never get used to their pale\r\nskins_, he thought. _And they talk so much._ "Yes," he said. "I know\r\nmany of your people find our planet a difficult one to live on. We are\r\nbetter adapted for such life than you."\r\n\r\n"Sure," the Earthman said. "Say, could I get some rest now? I\'m pretty\r\nwell shot after that tour of your desert."\r\n\r\n"Certainly," said Marik. "Kenra Sarg, will you show our guest to one of\r\nour rooms? Feel free to stay as long as you care to," he said to the\r\nEarthman. "Carthule\'s generosity is unbounded."\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t worry about that," the Earthman said. "I\'m not going to stay\r\nfor long. Just a day or so to recover my bearings, so to speak, and\r\nonce I\'m in traveling shape again I\'m heading straight for Corolla."\r\nKenra Sarg led him away, and he followed, still talking.\r\n\r\nMarik looked briefly up at the sky, but Carthule made no answer. For\r\nsome reason Marik felt suspicious of this Earthman, and as he moved\r\ntoward the room of prayer to perform the service customary upon the\r\narrival of one seeking sanctuary, he uttered a small, silent plea to\r\nCarthule to keep his mind free of groundless hatreds.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Marik finished his devotion before the great purple figure of\r\nCarthule, he kissed the blazing eye of the statue as was his private\r\ncustom, humbled himself before the altar, and turned to leave.\r\n\r\n"I waited till you were through, Marik," said a tall figure in priestly\r\nrobes who had been standing at the door. "I didn\'t want to interrupt\r\nyour service.

=== Chunk 6 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Polla San! Why have you come here now? I expected you next month!"\r\n\r\nMarik looked anxiously at his fellow priest. He knew well that the old\r\npriest of the neighboring temple left his books and his meditations\r\ninfrequently, and never came to visit Marik without first sending\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\n"Serious business," said Polla San. Marik noticed for the first time\r\nthat the other was wearing the gold band. It was a sign of deep sorrow.\r\n\r\n"Tell me outside," Marik said. "This is not the room for it."\r\n\r\n"This is of His realm," Polla San said. "Listen: not long ago one\r\nof the Earthmen arrived at my temple. He said he was on his way to\r\nCorolla, and was looking for shelter and a place to sleep before\r\ncrossing the desert. Of course, we welcomed him and, since we had no\r\nmore beds, I gave him my room and slept on the floor in the mealroom.\r\nLast night he left, hurriedly, without telling anyone. When I found my\r\nroom empty, I concluded he had gone, and I went to the room of prayer\r\nto offer my wish that Carthule protect him on his journey. I bowed\r\nbefore the statue, even as you did now--and when I looked up I saw that\r\nthe eye had been stolen!"\r\n\r\n"No!" Marik said. He turned and looked at his own statue of Carthule.\r\nIn the center of the forehead burned the irreplaceable stone that had\r\nbeen set there century upon century before--a great red stone with\r\nsecret fires burning in its heart. He tried to picture the eye not\r\nthere, and could not. The eye was the heart of the Temple.\r\n\r\n"Our Earthman had stolen the eye," Polla San said. "But he is still in\r\nour power. He left so hurriedly that he forgot this." He reached into\r\nhis robe and took out a small metallic object.\r\n\r\n"His compass," Polla San said. "Without this, he cannot cross the\r\ndesert. He is still out there somewhere. Come: let your acolytes and\r\nmine search the desert for him, regain the eye, and give him the death\r\nhe deserves."\r\n\r\nMarik sank to his knees before the statue. "No," he said.\r\n\r\n"No?" Polla San put his hand on the other\'s shoulder. "We are within\r\nour rights. The Earthmen will agree with us; he has committed a\r\nsacrilege and we must punish him for it. Why be afraid?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s not that," Marik said. "He richly deserves death. But he is not\r\nin the desert. He is here."\r\n\r\n"Here?"\r\n\r\n"I saw him wandering out there and sent Kenra Sarg to bring him in.\r\nHe is asleep in one of our guest rooms now. I was just performing the\r\nGuest Rite for him when you came."\r\n\r\nPolla San sank to his knees alongside Marik. "This is serious, Marik.\r\nIf he is a guest of yours, he is inviolate. He will sleep here in the\r\nhome of Carthule after having committed the greatest of desecrations,\r\nand we must serve him and feed him and shelter him. It\'s not right,\r\nMarik!

=== Chunk 7 ===
"\r\n\r\nMarik turned in amazement. "You\'re not questioning the Word, are you?\r\nThe Guest Rite is inviolable. As long as he is our guest, we cannot\r\nharm him. To punish him for his act would be a greater violation than\r\nthe act itself."\r\n\r\n"But can we let this Earthman remain a guest of Carthule, Marik? Let\r\nhim sleep down there with the eye in his pocket, and not do a thing\r\nabout it! He could flaunt the jewel under our noses and we\'d have to\r\nnod our heads and offer him more food."\r\n\r\n"The way of Carthule is the right way," Marik said. "The Guest Rite\r\nis inviolable. We will continue to treat this Earthman as we would\r\nCarthule Himself."\r\n\r\n"But what can I do, Marik? My temple is no longer a temple without the\r\neye!"\r\n\r\n"Carthule will show us the way, Polla San. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
Suppose we pray."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following morning the Earthman, after a hearty meal, stretched\r\nhimself luxuriously and looked out across the desert.\r\n\r\n"I guess I\'ll be moving along," he said to Marik. "I\'m in fine shape\r\nnow, thanks."\r\n\r\n"I am glad you found your stay restful," Marik said, concealing his\r\nfeelings for the desecrator. "Carthule is ever-providing."\r\n\r\nThe Earthman began to move idly up and down the mealroom, examining the\r\nancient furnishings. "That reminds me," he said. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
"You wouldn\'t have a\r\ncompass to lend me, would you?"\r\n\r\n"A compass?" Marik let a puzzled frown cross his forehead. "What may a\r\ncompass be?" he asked in just the right tone of ignorance.\r\n\r\nThe Earthman glanced at him impatiently. "You know," he said, gesturing\r\nwith his hands. "It\'s a sort of a little metal box with a magnetic\r\npointer. You must have seen them.

=== Chunk 10 ===
"\r\n\r\n"No," Marik said. "Out here we rarely have guests from your world. I\r\nhave not seen any compasses."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you use them yourselves--or something equivalent, I mean? A\r\ncompass is for traveling. It tells you what direction you\'re going in."\r\n\r\nMarik smiled. "We of Carthule have no need of such things, friend. We\r\nneed no external guides here."\r\n\r\nThe Earthman worried a tangled wisp of hair. "Nothing at all? How do\r\nyou find your way around in the desert?"\r\n\r\n"We know how to travel," said Polla San quietly, emerging from his\r\nreverie.\r\n\r\n"But--how can I get back to Corolla without a compass? I\'ll just get\r\nlost again!" The Earthman looked anxiously from one impassive blue face\r\nto another.\r\n\r\n"Carthule will help you, friend," Marik said. "Carthule helps all who\r\nlove Him."\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Marik that the Earthman paled a little.\r\n\r\n"Maybe you could lend me a guide," he said. "I can pay well. Maybe you\r\ncould let me have that big fellow who brought me in from the desert?\r\nHe could just show me the way to Corolla and then come right back."\r\n\r\n"Our acolytes have no time for such journeys," Marik said. "We are busy\r\nhere all the day long."\r\n\r\n"But all you do is pray--I mean--" he broke off, realizing he had\r\ninsulted his hosts. He turned and stared out at the shifting sands.\r\n\r\n"You will have to set out alone," Polla San said.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you let me have anyone? Just a kitchen boy?" His hard little\r\neyes flicked from one priest to the other. "Anyone at all? Otherwise\r\nI\'m stuck here for good!"\r\n\r\n"Carthule will guide you," Marik said.\r\n\r\nThe Earthman stared angrily at the tall priests. "I\'m beginning\r\nto think you want me to get lost again," he said. "You talk about\r\nCarthule, and charity, but because I\'m an Earthman you won\'t help me.\r\nBut I\'ll show you. I\'ll get back to Corolla. And you\'ll pay for this\r\nwhen I do!

=== Chunk 11 ===
"\r\n\r\nHe ran out. Marik and Polla, sitting quietly, exchanged glances.\r\n\r\n"We are moving in the right direction," Polla San said. "But I think\r\nyou would be wise to guard your room of prayer lest he seek to add to\r\nhis collection."\r\n\r\n"No fear of that," Marik said. 

=== Chunk 12 ===
"We\'ll see him again."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Earthman disappeared later that morning. Kenra Sarg reported that\r\nhe had set out, alone, in the general direction of Corolla, after\r\nfruitlessly attempting to bribe one of the kitchen boys to accompany\r\nhim. He had offered them fabulous sums, but they had laughed at him.\r\n\r\nThe Eye of Marik\'s Carthule was still in place, but one of the younger\r\nacolytes, who had been praying all morning, told Marik that the\r\nEarthman had furtively entered the room of prayer and had backed out\r\nupon seeing the priest at his devotions.\r\n\r\nWith the Earthman gone, Marik returned to the calm of his daily\r\nroutine. The after-meal meditation was a pleasant one; he and Polla\r\nSan sat facing the desert, contemplating the grandeur of Carthule and\r\npondering the meaning of His ways, until they sank into a transcendent\r\npeace. As the night winds began to cool the desert, they fell into a\r\ndiscussion of the problem of evil.\r\n\r\nMarik maintained that Carthule had created the Earthmen out of His\r\ninfinite wisdom, better to show the virtue of His people by contrast;\r\nwhile Polla San, wandering on the very edge of orthodox theology,\r\nsuggested that the god whom the Earthman worshipped was actually\r\nindependent of Carthule, representing the embodiment of evil as\r\nCarthule was the personification of good.\r\n\r\nMarik refused to accept this, arguing that Carthule had created both\r\nHis people and the Earthmen, or perhaps--as a concession to Polla\r\nSan--that he had created the god of the Earthmen who, in turn, had\r\ncreated the Earthmen. The discussion went on through the night, while\r\nthe night winds swirled the sand up around the temple, and they felt no\r\nneed of sleep.\r\n\r\n"Your theory denies the omnipotence of Carthule," Marik said, as the\r\nnight winds began to lower in intensity. "If you postulate an evil\r\nforce of as great power as the good, you deny the factors on which our\r\nmorality--" Marik broke off, seeing that Polla San had slipped off into\r\nthe near-sleep of a reverie.\r\n\r\nHe stood up, his long legs cramped after the afternoon and night of\r\nsitting, and walked up and down. The desert was settling into its\r\nmorning calm after the tempestuous night. He stared out across it,\r\nthinking of the Earthman who had set out for Corolla with the priceless\r\neye of Carthule in a pouch by his side.\r\n\r\nThere was a figure in the distance, walking slowly and with great\r\ndifficulty in widening circles, following a wild path to the temple.\r\nMarik lifted his nictitating lid to make sure his eyes were not playing\r\nhim false.\r\n\r\nThen, rather than awakening Kenra Sarg or Polla San, he did up his robe\r\nand went out in the desert to fetch the Earthman back himself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe had been wandering all night, tossed by the night winds, eyes and\r\nears and mouth choked with sand. He was still master enough of himself\r\nto throw an angry glare at Marik when the priest approached, but he\r\nsuffered himself to be lifted like a child and carried back to the\r\ntemple. The pouch was still hanging by his side, Marik noted.\r\n\r\n"I see our friend has returned," Polla San said.\r\n\r\n"Yes," Marik said. "Yesterday morning he departed without taking\r\nleave and lost his way again on the way to Corolla. After a night in\r\nthe desert he found his way back to us and is once again looking for\r\nsanctuary. This is true, isn\'t it?" Marik said, looking down at the\r\nEarthman cradled in his arms.\r\n\r\nThe Earthman angrily spat out some sand.\r\n\r\n"Carthule in His mercy has brought our wanderer back," Polla San said.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll take him below," Marik said. "His night in the desert has left\r\nhim weak and sore, and he needs rest. But he will always find sanctuary\r\nhere with Carthule. Carthule shows His generosity to the lowest of\r\ncreatures."\r\n\r\nKenra Sarg appeared at the door. "I see our guest has returned," he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"Yes. He has come back to us." Marik handed the Earthman over to Kenra\r\nSarg, despite an impotent look of rage from the huddled, battered\r\nlittle thief.\r\n\r\n"Take him to the room he had, and let him rest. He has traveled, and he\r\nis weary. 

=== Chunk 13 ===
I will go to the room of prayer, and offer up the Guest Rite\r\nfor him, for he is our guest again. For as long as he cares to stay."\r\n\r\nKenra Sarg nodded and carried the Earthman inside.\r\n\r\nMarik turned to Polla San. "Carthule has treated us well. I always feel\r\nhappy when we have a guest."\r\n\r\nPolla San smiled. "He still has the eye, I hope."\r\n\r\n"He still does. I don\'t think he got too far last night. I\'ve never\r\nseen anyone quite so angry."\r\n\r\n"He will never find his way to Corolla alone," Polla San said. "Not\r\nwithout this." He thoughtfully fondled the compass in his hand.\r\n\r\n"If my acolytes were not all so busy, I would allow one to guide him,"\r\nMarik said, smiling. "But I can spare none, and I enjoy offering our\r\nhospitality. He is our guest, and we must do all in our power to make\r\nhis stay enjoyable. Perhaps he will never want to leave."\r\n\r\n"No," Polla San said, standing up and flexing his legs. "He will leave\r\noften, and silently. Perhaps he will take your statue\'s eye as well, to\r\nput in the pouch by his side. But he will return, as he did yesterday."\r\n\r\n"He will return," Marik said. "Again and again. He will never find his\r\nway across the desert to Corolla, and eventually he will stay here as\r\nour permanent guest. And one day he shall die, if not sooner then\r\nlater--these Earthmen are a short-lived breed--and we will recover the\r\neyes, which will still be in the pouch by his side."\r\n\r\n"It is wonderful to have a guest," Polla San said.\r\n\r\n"It is," Marik said. "He shall live here with the eyes by his side, and\r\none day he will die and we can recover our treasures from him. He can\r\nnever get far with them. We can wait. He has but a few decades left,\r\nwhile Carthule has all eternity. Come," he said.\r\n\r\nTogether they went to the room of prayer to offer the service of the\r\nGuest Rites.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
