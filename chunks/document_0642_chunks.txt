]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n\r\nSunset. _They\'re coming for me, tonight_, he knew as he woke.\r\n\r\nSunset. Not really--if he were to get dressed now, and go out on the\r\nstreet, the red globe would still be hanging over the cliffs of New\r\nJersey. But the shadow of the building next door had fallen over his\r\napartment windows, and he sleepily pushed a cigarette between his numb\r\nlips and swung his feet over the side of the bed, fumbling with a\r\nmatch as he walked over to the small radio on the windowsill and turned\r\nit on. There was a double-header between the Giants and Cincinnati--the\r\nfirst game was probably in its last inning.\r\n\r\nSunset--odd, how the conditioning worked. Was it conditioning? Or\r\nwere the old wives\' tales not so absurd, after all? But he _could_ go\r\nout in the sunlight--had done it many times. His tan proved it. He\r\ntouched silver and cold iron countless times each day, crossed running\r\nwater--and he\'d gone to church every Sunday, until he was twelve. No,\r\nthere _was_ a core of truth under the fantastically complex shell of\r\nnonsense, but the old limitations were not part of it. He shrugged.\r\nNeither were most of the powers.\r\n\r\nStill, he liked to sleep in the daytime. His schedule seemed to gain an\r\nhour at night, lose one in the morning, until, almost unnoticeably, it\r\nhad slipped around the clock.\r\n\r\nHe went into the bathroom while the worn tubes in the radio warmed up\r\nslowly, and washed his face, brushed his teeth, shaved. He combed his\r\nhair, then paused thoughtfully. Wouldn\'t do any harm. _No full moon\r\nin here, either_, he thought, looking up at the circular fluorescent\r\ntube in the ceiling, but he noticed no impediment as he coalesced,\r\ndropped to all fours, and ran his pelt against the curry-combs he had\r\nscrewed to the bathroom door. He did a thorough job, enjoying it, and,\r\nafter he had realigned, walked out of the bathroom in time to hear the\r\nGiants making their final, fruitless out of the first game. Five-Zero,\r\nCincinnati, and he grimaced in disgust. Four shut-outs in the last\r\nfive games.\r\n\r\nHe laughed at himself, then, for actually being annoyed. Still and all,\r\nit wasn\'t the first time a man became emotionally involved in a mirage.\r\n\r\nWas it a mirage? True, there weren\'t really any such things as the San\r\nFrancisco Giants--but a man could certainly be expected to forget that,\r\noccasionally, if he were part of the same illusion at least half the\r\ntime. And certainly, such stuff as dreams are made of is solid enough\r\nwhen you are yourself a dream.\r\n\r\nHe went out in the kitchen and started coffee, then came back and sat\r\ndown next to the radio, hardly listening to the recap of the game.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOdd, how it had all started. Being suddenly marooned on this planet,\r\nforced to survive, somehow, through the long years while waiting for\r\nrescue. How many years had it been, now? Some five hundred thousand,\r\nin the subjective reference for this particular universe. He knew the\r\nformula for conversion into objective time--it all worked out to the\r\nequivalent of about six months--but that wasn\'t what mattered, as long\r\nas they\'d all had to survive in _this_ universe.\r\n\r\nSleep--suspended animation, if you wanted to call it that--had been\r\nthe only answer. And they couldn\'t do _that_, directly. They\'d had to\r\nresort to chrysalids.\r\n\r\nHe smiled to himself, got up, and turned down the fire under the pot\r\nuntil the coffee was percolating softly.\r\n\r\nThe original plan had snowballed, somewhat.\r\n\r\nResolving chrysalids was one thing--making them eternal was another,\r\nand unnecessary. It was far simpler to arrange the chrysalids so they\'d\r\nbe able to reproduce themselves. And, of course, in order to survive,\r\nand take care of itself, a chrysalis had to have some independent\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\nAnd, so it worked. The chrysalis housed a sleeper, operating unawares\r\nand completely independent of him--or her--until the chrysalis wore\r\nout. Then the sleeper was passed on to a new chrysalis, with neither of\r\nthe chrysalids involved--nor, for that matter, the sleeper--conscious\r\nof the transfer. So it would continue, through the weary, subjective\r\nyears; generation upon generation of chrysalids, until, finally, the\r\nparamathematical path drifted back to touch this universe, and the\r\nsleepers could wake, and continue their journey.\r\n\r\nAnd if the human race chose to speculate on its origins in the\r\nmeantime, well, that was part of the snowball.\r\n\r\nHe got up again, and turned off the flame under the coffeepot. _Now,\r\nif I were a sorcerer--as defined by Cotton Mather\'s ilk, of course--_,\r\nhe thought, _I should be able to (a) turn the fire off without getting\r\nup, or, (b) generate the flame without the use of Con Edison\'s gas, or,\r\n(c), if I had any self-respect at all, conjure hot coffee out of thin\r\nair._ His lips twisted with nausea as he thought that nine out of ten\r\npeople would expect him to be drinking blood, as a matter of course.\r\n\r\nHe sighed with some bitterness, but more of resignation. Well, that was\r\njust another part of the snowball.\r\n\r\nBecause the chrysalids had done a magnificent job in all three of\r\nits subdivisions. They had kept the sleepers safe--and reproduced,\r\nand used their intelligence to survive. They had survived in spite\r\nof pestilence, famine, and flood--by learning enough to wipe out the\r\nfirst two, and control the third. It would seem that progress was not\r\na special quality to be specially desired. Most of the chrysalids were\r\nconsumed by a fierce longing for the Good Old Days, as a matter of\r\nfact. It was merely the inescapable accretion to sheer survival.\r\n\r\nAnd so came civilization. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
With civilization: recreation. In short, the\r\nSan Francisco Giants, and--He reached over, suddenly irritated at the\r\nraspy-voiced and slightly frantic recapitulation of the lost ballgame,\r\nand changed the station. And Beethoven.\r\n\r\nHe relaxed, smiling slightly at himself once again, and let the music\r\nsing to him. Chrysalids, eh? Well, they certainly weren\'t his kind\r\nof life, free to swing from star to star, riding the great flux of\r\nCreation from universe to universe. But whence Beethoven? Whence\r\nRembrandt, Da Vinci, and Will Shakespeare, hunched over a mug of ale\r\nand dashing off genius on demand, with half an eye on the serving wench?\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. What would happen to this people, when the sleepers\r\nwoke?\r\n\r\nThe snowball. Ah, yes, the snowball. That was a good part of it--and he\r\nand his kind were another.\r\n\r\n_If we had known_, he thought. _If we had known how it would be...?_\r\n\r\nBut, they hadn\'t known. It had been just a petty argument, at first.\r\nNobody knew, now, who had started it. But there were two well-defined\r\nsides, now, and he was an Insurgent, for some reason. The winning\r\nside gives the names that stick. _They_ were Watchers--an honorable\r\nname, a name to conjure up trust, and duty, and loyalty. And he was\r\nan Insurgent. Well, let it stand. Accept the heritage of dishonor and\r\nhatred. Somewhere, sometime, a gage was flung, and he was heir to the\r\nchallenge.\r\n\r\nThe chrysalids solved the problem of survival, of course. But the\r\nproblem of rescue had remained. For rescue, in the sense of help from\r\nan outside agency, would be disastrous. When the path shifted back,\r\nthey had to learn of it themselves, and go on of their own accord--or\r\ngo into slavery. For there is one currency that outlives document and\r\ntoken. Personal obligation. And, if they were so unlucky as to have an\r\nactual rescuer, the obligation would be high--prohibitively so.\r\n\r\nThe solution had seemed simple, at first. In each generation of\r\nchrysalids, there would be one aware individual--one Watcher, to keep\r\nguard, and to waken the rest should the path drift back in the lifetime\r\nof his chrysalis. Then, when that particular chrysalis wore out, the\r\nWatcher would be free to return to sleep, while another took his place.\r\n\r\nHis mouth twisted to one side as he took a sip of coffee.\r\n\r\nA simple, workable plan--until someone had asked, "Well and good.\r\nExcellent. And what if this high-minded Watcher realizes that we,\r\nasleep, are all in his power? What if he makes some agreement with a\r\nrescuer, or, worse still, decides to _become_ our rescuer when the path\r\ndrifts back? What\'s to prevent him, eh? No," that long-forgotten, wary\r\nindividual had said, "I think we\'d best set some watchers to watch the\r\nWatcher."\r\n\r\n_Quis custodiet?_\r\n\r\nWhat had it been like? He had no way of knowing, for he had no memory\r\nof his exact identity. That would come only with Awakening. He had only\r\na knowledge of his heritage. For all he knew, it had been he who raised\r\nthe fatal doubt--or, had been the first delegated Watcher. He shrugged.\r\nIt made no difference. He was an Insurgent now.\r\n\r\nBut he could imagine the voiceless babel among their millions--the\r\nargument, the cold suspicion, the pettiness. Perhaps he was passing\r\nscornful judgment on himself, he realized. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
What of it? He\'d earned it.\r\n\r\nSo, finally, two groups. One content to be trustful. And the other\r\na fitful, restless clan, awakening sporadically, trusting to chance\r\nalone, which, by its laws, would insure that many of them were awake\r\nwhen the path drifted back. The Insurgents.\r\n\r\nSo, as well, two basic kinds of chrysalids. The human kind, and the\r\nothers. Wolves, bears, tigers. Bats, seals--every kind of living thing,\r\nexcept the human. The Insurgent kind.\r\n\r\nAnd so the struggle began. It was a natural outgrowth of the\r\nfundamental conflict. Which side had tried to over-power the first\r\nchrysalis? _Who first enslaved another man?_ he thought, and\r\nhalf-snarled.\r\n\r\nThat, too, was unimportant now. For the seed had been planted. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
The\r\nthought was there. _Those who are awake can place those who sleep under\r\nobligation._ Control the chrysalids, and you control the sleepers\r\nwithin. But chrysalids endure for one generation, and then the sleepers\r\npass on.\r\n\r\nWhat then? Simplicity. Group your chrysalids. Segregate them. Set up\r\npens for them, mark them off, and do it so the walls and fences endure\r\nthrough long years.\r\n\r\n_This is my country. All men are brothers, but stay on your side of the\r\nline, brother._\r\n\r\n_Sorry, brother--you\'ve got a funny shape to your nose. You just go\r\nlive in that nice, walled-off part of my city, huh, brother?_\r\n\r\n_Be a good fellow, brother. Just move to the back of the bus, or I\'ll\r\nlynch you, brother._\r\n\r\nAnd the chrysali die, the sleepers transfer--into another chrysalis in\r\nthe same pen. _SPQR. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Vive, Napoleon! Sieg Heil!_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSome of the time it was the Watchers. Some of the time it was the\r\nInsurgents. And some of the time, of course, the chrysalids evolved\r\ntheir own leaders, and imitated. For, once the thing had begun, it\r\ncould not be stopped. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
The organization was always more powerful than\r\nthe scattered handsful. So, the only protection against organization\r\nwas organization.\r\n\r\nBut it was not organization in itself that was the worst of it. It\r\nwas the fact that the only way to control the other side\'s penned\r\nchrysalids was to break down a wall in the pen, or to build a larger\r\npen including many of the smaller ones.\r\n\r\nAnd, again, it was too late, now, to decide who had been at fault.\r\n\r\n_Who first invented War?_\r\n\r\nThe way to survive war is to wage more decisive war. The chrysalids\r\nhad to survive. They learned. They ... progressed? ... by so doing.\r\nThey progressed from bows to ballistas to bombs. From arbalests to\r\naircraft to A-bombs. Phosphorus. Chlorine. HE. Fragmentation. Napalm.\r\nDust, and bacteriological warfare. Thermopylae, Crecy, the Battle of\r\nBritain, Korea, Indo-China, Indonesia.\r\n\r\nAnd try to believe as you sit here, Insurgent, that none of this is\r\nreal, that it is all a phase, acted out by dolls of your own creation\r\nin a sham battle that is really only a bad dream in the unfamiliar bed\r\nof a lodging for the night!\r\n\r\n_Chrysalids they might be, Insurgent_, he lashed himself, _but it\r\nwas the greed and suspicion of all your kind--Insurgent and Watcher\r\nalike--that set this juggernaut to rolling!_\r\n\r\nHe took another sip of coffee, and almost gagged as he realized it had\r\ngrown cold. He got up and walked into the kitchen with the cup in his\r\nhand. He threw the rest of the coffee in the sink, washed out the cup,\r\nand turned on the burner under the coffeepot.\r\n\r\nOne more thing--one more development, born of suspicion.\r\n\r\nFor the original one-Watcher plan had been abandoned, of course. And\r\nhere, again, there was no telling whose blame it was. _Quis custodiet\r\nipsos custodes?_ Who will watch the Watchers? There had been many\r\nWatchers to a generation--how many, no one knew. They balanced each\r\nother off, and they checked the random number of Insurgents who\r\nawoke in each generation. So, more Insurgents awoke to check the\r\nWatchers--and, more.\r\n\r\nIn spite of what the Transylvanians believed, a wolf is no match for a\r\nman, except under special conditions. A tiger can pull a man down--but\r\ncannot fire back at the hunters. A seal is prey to the Eskimo.\r\n\r\nSo, "werewolves." Child of fear, of Watcher propaganda, and of\r\none-tenth fact. The animals were Insurgent chrysalids, right enough.\r\nBut, for an awake Insurgent to compete with a Watcher, the Insurgent,\r\ntoo, had to be a man--or something like it.\r\n\r\nThe coffee had warmed up. He poured himself a fresh cup, and added\r\ncream and sugar absently. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
The refrigerator was empty. He reached in and\r\nturned it off. No more need for that, after tonight.\r\n\r\nSo, that was the power the Insurgents had. The only power, and the\r\nWatchers had it, as well. They could resolve their chrysalids into any\r\nform they chose--realign. A wolf could become a man--_without_ hair on\r\nhis palm, and _with_ garlic on his breath, if he so chose. A man--a\r\nWatcher, of course--could become a wolf.\r\n\r\nThus, the final development. Espionage and counter-espionage.\r\nInfiltration. Spying, if you chose.\r\n\r\nThe Insurgent smiled bitterly, and drained the cup. And propaganda, of\r\ncourse. Subtle--most of it indirect, a good deal of it developed by\r\nthe chrysalids themselves, but propaganda, nevertheless. Kill the evil\r\nones--kill the eaters of dead flesh, the drinkers of blood. They are\r\nthe servants of the Evil One.\r\n\r\nHe almost retched.\r\n\r\nBut, you could hardly blame them. It was a war, and, in a war, you play\r\nall your cards, even if some of them were forced into your hand.\r\n\r\n_Yes, and I\'ve played genuine werewolf on occasion, when I had to._\r\n\r\nHe started to wash the coffeepot and the cup--then, threw both into the\r\ngarbage can. He walked back to the radio and dialed it away from Eroica\r\nand back to baseball. The Giants were losing, Three-Zero, in the third\r\ninning.\r\n\r\nThe house phone buzzed. He went to it slowly, picked it calmly off the\r\nhook.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Artie?"\r\n\r\n"Mister Disbrough, there\'s a couple of guys coming up to see you. I\'m\r\nnot supposed to tell you about it, but.... Well, I figured ..." the\r\ndoorman said.\r\n\r\n"All right. Thanks, Artie," he answered quietly. He almost hung up,\r\nthen thought of something. "Artie?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mister Disbrough?"\r\n\r\n"There\'ll be a couple of fifths of Dewar\'s in my cupboard. I won\'t be\r\nback for a while. You and Pete are welcome to them. And thanks again.

=== Chunk 9 ===
"\r\n\r\nHe hung up and began to dress, realigning his chrysalis to give him the\r\nappearance of clothing. The doorbell rang, and he went to open it for\r\nthe two men from the FBI.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\nWhat difference did it make, what particular pen he represented?\r\nRather, since the sober-faced men knew very well which pen it was, why\r\nshould it be so necessary to them for him to confirm what they already\r\nknew without a shadow of a doubt?\r\n\r\n"Now, then, Mister Disbrough," one of the FBI men said, leaning his\r\nhands on the edge of the table at which the Insurgent was sitting, "we\r\nknow who sent you."\r\n\r\n_Good. Why bother me, then?_\r\n\r\n"We know where you got your passport, we know who met you at the dock,\r\nwe know your contacts. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
We have photographs of everyone you\'ve met\r\nand talked to, we have tapes of every telephone call you\'ve made or\r\nreceived. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
We also know that you are the top man in your organization\r\nhere."\r\n\r\n_And?_ They were chrysalids, every one of them. Perhaps there was no\r\nWatcher behind them--perhaps. But he\'d been picked up a little too\r\nquickly. The net had folded itself around him too soon. No--there had\r\nto be a Watcher. He wished they\'d stop this talking and bring him out.\r\n\r\n"Now, I\'d simply like to point out to you that this is an airtight\r\ncase. No lawyer in the world will be able to break it down. You\'ll\r\nretain counsel, of course. But, I\'d simply like to point out to you\r\nthat there\'ll be no point to any denial you may make to us. We _know_\r\nwhat you\'ve been doing. I\'d suggest you save your defense for the\r\ntrial."\r\n\r\nHe looked up at him and smiled ruefully. "If you\'ve got a list of\r\ncharges," he said, "I\'ll be glad to confess to all of them--provided,\r\nof course, that it _is_ a complete list."\r\n\r\n_I\'m sure it doesn\'t list me as a werewolf_, he thought. _I wonder\r\nwhat the sentence would be--death by firing squad equipped with silver\r\nbullets?_\r\n\r\nBut, then, he wasn\'t going to confess to that, anyway.\r\n\r\n"Um!" The FBI man looked suspicious. Obviously, he\'d expected nothing\r\nof the kind.\r\n\r\n"No strings," the Insurgent reassured him. "The job\'s over, and it\'s\r\ntime to punch the clock."\r\n\r\nWhich was just about the way it was. But he wanted that Watcher. If he\r\nwas in the office at all, he\'d almost have to come out to witness the\r\nconfession. After all, the Insurgent was supposed to be a pretty big\r\nfish.\r\n\r\nThe FBI man went into a cubicle office set off to one side. When he\r\ncame out, carrying a sheaf of paper, the Watcher was with him.\r\n\r\nThe Insurgent felt the hackles standing up on the back of his neck,\r\nand something rumbled inaudibly at the base of his throat. He knew.\r\nHe could tell. He could smell Watcher every step of the way, from the\r\nday he had docked until now, when the scent--half there, half the pure\r\nintuition of instinct--rose up before him in an over-powering wave.\r\n\r\nThen he saw the look of distaste crawl across the Watcher\'s face, and\r\nhe barked a laugh that drew curious looks from the men in the office.\r\n_Hello, brother._\r\n\r\nHe saw the bulge of the hip holster on the Watcher\'s belt, and laughed\r\nagain. _So, we play the game_, he thought. _We add up scores, and, in\r\nthe end, the side with the most points wins. Forget that there should\r\nbe no sides, that every point, no matter for whom scored, is a mark of\r\nshame and disgrace._\r\n\r\nHe wondered, briefly, whether the Watcher was of his kind by choice,\r\nor whether it was simply something that had happened, as it was with\r\nhim. Probably. Two separate heritages had met, represented by identical\r\nindividuals who happened to have awakened in dissimilar chrysalids.\r\n\r\n_Will we remember?_ he wondered. _When we awaken, will we remember\r\nthis? How we battled, blinded, in the shadows of our own casting?_ Or\r\nwas there more mercy in Creation than they, themselves, had shown to\r\nthe chrysalids? He had three brothers among the sleepers. When they\r\nwoke, would they embrace, not remembering that each had killed the\r\nother countless times? Or forgetting that they had stood together, on\r\nsome battlefield? Would all the old comrades, all the bitter enemies,\r\nbe wiped from memory? He hoped so. With every segment of his being, he\r\nhoped so, for there was no peace, through eternity, if it was otherwise.\r\n\r\nHe stood up, lightly, tensing the muscles in his calves. The FBI men,\r\nsuddenly alert, began to move for him, but he\'d maneuvered things so\r\nthat none of them were close enough to him.\r\n\r\nThe Watcher went pale.\r\n\r\n"Shall I coalesce, brother?" the Insurgent asked, the words rumbling\r\nout of his throat, a grin of derision baring his teeth.\r\n\r\n"_No!_" The Watcher was completely frightened. Words could be explained\r\naway, particularly if they sounded like nonsense to the other men in\r\nthe room. But a werewolf, fanging the throat of a Watcher who would\r\nhave to fight back with _his_ spectacular weapons.... Nothing in the\r\nworld could keep the rumors from spreading. The chrysalids might even\r\nlearn, finally and irrevocably, the origin of their species.\r\n\r\n"Your obligation, brother," the Insurgent half-laughed, and kept\r\nstalking toward the Watcher. _Perhaps he is my brother._\r\n\r\n_And if he is...?_\r\n\r\nNo difference. The shadows are thick and very dark. One of the other\r\nmen shot him in the side, but he sprang for the Watcher, carefully\r\nhuman, to hold the Watcher to his debt, and the Watcher shot him three\r\ntimes in the chest, once in the throat, and once in the stomach.\r\n\r\nThe shape of a cross? Did he believe it himself? 

=== Chunk 12 ===
Was it true? A plus\r\nsign, cancelling a negative force? Who knew? Shadow, shadow, all is\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nHe fell to his knees, coughing, in victory. Score one more for the\r\nInsurgents, and a Watcher, at that!\r\n\r\n"Thank you, brother," the Insurgent murmured, and fell into the long\r\nsleep with a grateful sigh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
