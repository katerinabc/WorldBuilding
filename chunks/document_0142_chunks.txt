M._\r\n\r\nAfter awhile the blinding light was like actual physical pressure\r\nagainst his tightly squinched eyes. He tried to burrow deeper into the\r\nprotectively warm, cave-like place where he\'d been safe from them for\r\nso long. But he couldn\'t escape them. Their hands, their big, red,\r\nhideously smooth hands had him, now. They were tugging and pulling at\r\nhim with a strength impossible to fight. Still he struggled.\r\n\r\nHe tried to cry out but there was no sound from his constricted\r\nthroat. There were only the frightening noises from outside, louder,\r\nnow. He tried to twist and squirm against the hands dragging him\r\ntoward that harsh, blinding light. He was too small, too weak,\r\ncompared to them. He couldn\'t fight them off. He felt himself being\r\nstretched and strained and forced with cruel determination. He didn\'t\r\nwant to go _out there_.

He knew what was waiting for him _out there_.\r\nHe _couldn\'t_ go. Not _out there_, where....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Jeff McKinney was three years old he tipped a pot of scalding\r\nwater from the stove onto himself. He was badly burned and scarred. He\r\nhovered between life and death for several weeks. Jeff\'s father was\r\nout of work at the time and they were living in a cold water tenement.\r\nSomething about the case caught a tabloid\'s attention and it was\r\nplayed up as a human interest sob story. It came to the attention of a\r\nwealthy man who volunteered to pay for plastic surgery. Then followed,\r\nlong months of that kind of torture, but Jeff McKinney came out of it\r\nnot too badly scarred. Not on the surface, anyhow. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
But his face had a\r\nstrange hue. There was a frozen, mask-like cast to his features when\r\nhe smiled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHe was eight when he saw his father killed. He was in the taxi the\r\nolder McKinney now drove for a living when the father stepped out of\r\nthe driver\'s side onto a busy street without looking back first. The\r\nspeeding truck took the car door and Jeff\'s father with it for half a\r\nblock, wedged between front wheel and fender. Jeff never forgot the\r\nsound of that, and the screaming. Nor his shock when he suddenly\r\nrealized that the screams were his own.\r\n\r\nJeff was a strange boy. He didn\'t have an average childhood. The\r\npoverty was more extreme after his father\'s death. He stayed home\r\nalone while his mother was out working at whatever job she could get,\r\nreading too much and thinking too much. Once, he looked at her with\r\nhaunted eyes and said: "Mother, why is life so bad? Why are people\r\neven born into a world like this?"\r\n\r\nWhat could she say to a question like that? She said: "Please,\r\nJefferson! Please don\'t talk that way. Life isn\'t all bad. You\'ll see.\r\nSome day, in spite of everything, you\'ll be somebody and you\'ll be\r\nhappy. The good times will come."\r\n\r\nThey did, of course. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
A few of them. There was the day he went upstate\r\non an outing for underprivileged boys and went fishing for the first\r\ntime. He caught a whopping trout and won a prize for it. That was\r\nnice; that was fun. That was when he was thirteen. That was the year\r\nthe gang of kids caught him on the way home from school and beat him\r\nunconscious because he never laughed; because they couldn\'t _make_ him\r\nlaugh. The year before his mother died.\r\n\r\nAt the orphanage he didn\'t mingle much with the other boys. He spent\r\nmost of his after-classes hours alone in the school\'s chemistry lab.\r\nHe liked to tinker with chemicals. They were cold, emotionless, immune\r\nto joy and sadness, yet they had purpose. He played the cello, too,\r\nwith haunting beauty, but not in the school band, only when he wanted\r\nto, when nobody was around and he could really feel the music.\r\n\r\nOnce, on the way home from his cello lesson in the music building, he\r\nsaw some boys playing football on the orphanage athletic field. He was\r\nsuddenly seized with a fierce determination to belong, to grab at some\r\nof the shouting, laughing happiness these boys seemed to have. He told\r\nthem he wanted to join in and play, too. He didn\'t understand why they\r\nlaughed so at this idea.\r\n\r\nThey stopped laughing, though, after the first time he ran with the\r\nball, and they all piled up on him and he didn\'t get up. He lay there,\r\nlooking so ghostly and breathing so harshly and with the trickle of\r\nblood coming out of his ears. But Jeff didn\'t know they had stopped\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\nHe recovered from that skull fracture, all right. Worse, though, than\r\nany of the unhappiness he suffered during his life, worse even than\r\nthe shocks of his father\'s and mother\'s deaths, was the thing that\r\nhappened to him when he was twenty and working at the laboratories of\r\na big drug company.\r\n\r\nHe met and fell hopelessly in love with a girl named Nina, a girl a\r\nfew years older than he was. They married and for the first few weeks\r\nJeff McKinney had happiness he\'d never known before. Until he came\r\nhome from work sick, one afternoon and saw Nina with the man from the\r\napartment over them. She didn\'t whine and beg for forgiveness, Nina\r\ndidn\'t. She stood boldly while the other man laughed and laughed and\r\nshe screamed invective upon Jefferson McKinney, telling him what she\r\nreally thought of him, a gloomy, puny weakling who couldn\'t even make\r\na decent living, telling him that she was through with him.\r\n\r\nA blank spot came into Jeff\'s life right then. When it was over, Nina\r\nand the other man were on the floor and there was blood on the kitchen\r\ncarving knife in Jeff\'s hand.\r\n\r\nThey didn\'t find him for awhile. He changed his name and appearance\r\nand hid in the soiled seams and ragged fringes of society. He learned\r\nthe anaesthetic powers of drugs and alcohol. He gave up trying to get\r\nanything out of this life. Then they finally picked him up, fished him\r\nfrom the river into which he\'d jumped. There were days of torture\r\nafter that, without the alcohol and drugs his wrecked system craved.\r\nRight there was the final hell that could have broken him completely.\r\nBut it didn\'t. It was like the terrible crisis after a long illness.\r\nThings began to get better, to go to the other extreme after that.\r\n\r\nA state psychiatrist brought Jeff\'s case to the attention of a noted\r\ncriminal lawyer. Neither Nina nor her lover had died from their knife\r\nwounds. On the plea of the unwritten law, Jeff McKinney got off with a\r\nsuspended sentence. The lawyer and psychiatrist learned of his\r\ninterest and knowledge and talent for chemistry and got him another\r\njob in the experimental laboratory of a big university.\r\n\r\nLater he married a girl named Elaine, who worked at the lab with him.\r\nThey had two children, and lived in a small comfortable cottage just\r\noff the University campus. For several years, they had all they wanted\r\nof life--comfort, health, happiness. Jeff thought that life could\r\nnever be more wonderful. All of his former, bitter, cynical views fell\r\naway from him. Hadn\'t he, with all odds against him, finally won out\r\nand acquired peace and contentment and a purpose in life? 

=== Chunk 5 ===
What was\r\nwrong with a world in which that could happen?\r\n\r\nThen there was the topper. Jefferson McKinney discovered a new drug\r\nwhich would cure and eventually eliminate a disease that was one of\r\nthe world\'s worst killers, the drug for which thousands of scientists\r\nhad been seeking for years.\r\n\r\nHe was feted and honored, became a national hero. The story of his\r\nlife and his discovery temporarily pushed even the doleful forecasts\r\nof an early Third War, the Big War, off the front pages. And Jeff was\r\nhumbly proud and grateful that he had paid now the debt he owed to a\r\nsociety that could make a final victory, like his, possible.\r\n\r\nIn a zenith of almost holy happiness, he stood one evening on a\r\nlecture platform in a huge auditorium in a great city, before\r\nthousands of worshipping people to make a thank-you speech after being\r\nawarded a world prize for his great scientific discovery.\r\n\r\nBut in the middle of his talk he broke off suddenly. A flash of\r\nblinding brilliance slashed through the windows. Horror painted his\r\nface. In a whisper, he cried: "No! 

=== Chunk 6 ===
No! It would make it all so\r\nsenseless!" His eyes looked like the eyes of a man with flaming\r\nsplinters jammed under his fingernails. His face seemed to pucker, and\r\ngrow infantile. Then he screamed: "No! Leave me alone! I _told_ you I\r\ndidn\'t want to come _out here_, to be one of _you_! Damn you, why did\r\nyou bring me _out here_? For--for _this_?..."\r\n\r\nThere were the shards of glass from the great auditorium windows,\r\nfloating inward, turning lazily. There were the brick walls crumbling,\r\ntumbling inward, scattering through the air in the same seeming slow\r\nmotion. The dust cloud and the sound, the flat blast-sound, came after\r\nthat, as the entire building--perhaps the world--disintegrated in the\r\neye-searing light....\r\n\r\n\r\n_December 8th, 1952, Two-Thirty A. M._\r\n\r\nThe flat of a rubber-gloved hand striking flesh made a splatting\r\nnoise. A thin, breathless but concentrated crying followed. The doctor\r\nlooked down at his charity clinic patient, the woman under the bright\r\ndelivery room lights.\r\n\r\n"Look at him--fighting like a little demon!" the doctor said. "Seemed\r\nalmost as though he didn\'t want to come out and join us.... What\'s the\r\nmatter, son? This is a bright, new, wonderful world to be born\r\ninto.... What are you going to call the boy, Mrs. McKinney?"\r\n\r\nThe woman under the lights forced a tired smile. "Jeff. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Jefferson\r\nMcKinney. That\'s going to be his name," she whispered proudly.\r\n\r\nThe baby\'s terrified squalling subsided into fretful, whimpering\r\nresignation.\r\n\r\n\r\n--THE END--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
