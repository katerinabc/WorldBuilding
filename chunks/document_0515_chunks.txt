]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Are you one of those people who save the best things for the\r\nlast ... who eat all the chocolate sundae away from under the maraschino\r\ncherry? If so, you are very like the Peter W. Merrill Moonplant.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt had no awareness of time, and so did not know nor concern itself with\r\nthe millennia that passed since it first drew up the dissolved silicates\r\nfrom the shifting grey remnants of soil and arranged them inside the\r\nwalls of the thousand green pods that were its body cells, and settled\r\ndown to wait. Somewhere within its fragile cortex, a tiny pulse of life\r\nbeat. It was a feeble pulse, to be sure, and one that a man, unless he\r\ncould observe it for a thousand years without blinking, would not be\r\naware of. As the normal human heart beats seventy-two times a minute, so\r\ndid this tiny swelling of tube contract once each hundred years; fifty\r\ntireless years of contraction, then fifty soothing years of relaxation,\r\nbringing the walls of the slender tube together, then letting them ease\r\napart.\r\n\r\nBut it was sufficient for its life.\r\n\r\nThe pallid yellow sap was moved about inside the plant, once each\r\nhundred years, and the plasm of the silicon-protected cellular structure\r\nabsorbed just the needed amount, bleeding off the waste products between\r\nthe very molecules of the silicon buttresses, and patiently waiting the\r\ncentury out till the second helping came oozing around.\r\n\r\nAnd so it lay dormant, through heat that could send a man into\r\nconvulsions of agony in seconds, through cold that fractional degree\r\nlower than can be achieved in a scientific laboratory. It did not know\r\nwhere it was, nor what it was, nor how precarious--by cosmic\r\nstandards--was its chance of survival, with sap enough stored in the\r\nstiff, coarse roots for only a few more million years.\r\n\r\nIt simply was, and knew that it was, and was satisfied.\r\n\r\nSuch a tiny organism can have only the most rudimentary of memories, but\r\nit remembered. Once--Once long before, there had been ... more.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLife had been the same, but somehow fuller. When it tried to recall\r\nexactly in what this fullness lay, the memory just was not there; only a\r\nvague recollection of comfort, motion, satiation.\r\n\r\nWhen the men landed upon the moon in the twentieth century, they did not\r\nfind it at first. Locating it would have been comparable to stumbling\r\nupon a solitary blade of grass, imbedded in ice at the South Pole. Men\r\ncame to the moon, though, and began to settle there. The first homes\r\nthey knew were mere metal shacks, filled with life-giving gases of their\r\nplanetary atmosphere, and devoid of all comforts save those necessary\r\nfor maintenance of life.\r\n\r\nBut men have a way of rising above the status quo, and so, within half a\r\npulsebeat of the plant, the surface of the moon became dotted with these\r\niglooic shacks, then pressurized tunnels radiated out in a unifying\r\nnetwork, and soon the Domes began to grow; immense translucent\r\nlight-weight structures of enormous strength bubbled up on the moon, and\r\nsoon cities were being built beneath them, strange towering fairyland\r\ncities on this satellite where people and architecture alike boasted six\r\ntimes the power possessed on Earth. The cities soared upward in\r\nglinting, stalagmitic pinnacles whose tapering ends seemed to threaten\r\nthe fabric of the Domes themselves, but were in reality still far below\r\nthe blue-white curving surface.\r\n\r\nMachines lay buried now in the grey pumice that was the surface of the\r\nmoon; machines that drained gases from the oxides and nitrates within\r\nthe planetoid and filled the Domes for the people with the life-giving\r\ngases. And still the moon grew more Domes, and more.\r\n\r\nAnd then, three motions of the tiny plant after the primal landing of\r\nmen on the moon, three half-cycles later, a pulse-and-a-half--It was\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nThe man who found it was an engineer, a man of high intelligence. For,\r\nbuilding on the moon was a perilous undertaking. A man had to know\r\nstresses and strains, had to be able to read gauges that warned of\r\nvacuum pockets beneath the crust of the moon that--if broken into--could\r\nsuck the life-giving gases from the metal caissons within which the men\r\nlaid the foundations of new Domes. Had it been on Earth, and the workman\r\nunionized and possibly unlettered, it would have had the fate of a\r\ndandelion that stands in the path of a growing subway tube.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the man--as mentioned--had intelligence.\r\n\r\nCarefully, the fossil--so he presumed--was cut away from the rock in\r\nwhich it was rooted, and laid gently in a bed of soft cotton, and that\r\nbed in a plastic casing, and the casing in a metal box. The box was\r\nloaded aboard a spaceship and sent to a man back on Earth.\r\n\r\nThis man was an eminent botanist, and--eminent or not--he nearly jumped\r\nwith joy when he\'d opened the box, unsealed the container, plucked away\r\nthe cotton, and saw the plant lying there. It was dead, insofar as he\r\nknew, and apparently useless except perhaps as a club, but the botanist\r\nwas delighted to receive it. Through his head passed notions of cutting\r\nit in two, then polishing the twin cut surfaces, and studying the cell\r\nstructure, so that he might compare its construction with similar--if\r\nthere were any--plants of Earth, and then write a learned thesis about\r\nit which would be read only by other eminent botanists, who would all\r\nthen curse their luck for not having been friends with any engineers on\r\nthe moon. The whole procedure--taking the cosmic view--was almost\r\npointless, but it would make the botanist happy, at least.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHowever, after setting up his instruments, and placing the plant in a\r\nsort of padded vise to steady it against the invasion of its privacy, he\r\nchanced to see a bit of root, broken off by sheer unaccustomed weight on\r\nthe planet, lying upon the lab table, and he placed that beneath the\r\nglass lens of his microscope and studied it instead.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be damned!" he said. "The plasm is _liquid_!"\r\n\r\nA few dozen of the shattered cells had indeed let their contents spill\r\nout onto the slide of his \'scope.\r\n\r\n"I wonder," he mused, "if it is viable?"\r\n\r\nWouldn\'t _that_ make for an interesting paper, he went on, building his\r\ndreams upon dreams. A moonplant! Growing in my garden! He decided, as\r\nis the way with botanists, to name his--it was now "his"; having\r\nabandoned liberty when it abandoned the moon--to name his plant after\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nAnd that\'s how it came to be called the "Peter W. Merrill Moonplant." He\r\nput it in his garden, arranged a small protective wire cylinder around\r\nit, and sprinkled it with water. Then he went into the house to start\r\ntyping up his notes for that forthcoming paper.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs he lay there in the soft loam, feeling the cool trickling of the\r\nwater passing over his stiff tendrils, the newly christened Pete felt a\r\nstirring within himself. The sunlight that now struck him was filtered\r\nby an atmosphere, and gentle in its action upon him. Pete prodded his\r\nmemory, and suddenly decided that silicates, after all, are not the most\r\ncomfortable of linings for one\'s tender green cells. He seemed to recall\r\na state of lush, sybaritic softness, in pre-silicate times. Decidedly,\r\nthe silicates must go, thought Pete.\r\n\r\nAnd go they did, molecule by molecule, down into the earth through his\r\nroots, which were now acting as tiny spigots, getting rid of the\r\nscratchy stuff that had bolstered the cell walls against change for\r\nmillennia past, leaving Pete softer, greener, livelier, and a constant\r\ndelight to the heart of Peter W. Merrill the First, whenever he came out\r\nto tend his plant, between pages of his thesis.\r\n\r\nPete, after spewing the last hateful molecule away, reversed his tiny\r\nfibre engines, and began to draw in. He drew in all sorts of things, as\r\nthe days passed. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
A lot of minerals, and just enough water to float them\r\nin. Mostly, Pete\'s growing hunger sought out iron. Pete didn\'t know why\r\nhe wanted iron, any more than a smoker knows why he wants another\r\ncigarette, but Pete\'s interest in iron was as intense as any smoker\'s in\r\ntobacco.\r\n\r\nAbove the ground, he grew very few inches larger, merely broadening his\r\ndark, green spiral leaves a bit to catch the tiny amount of warmth he\r\nrequired for growth. But beneath the soil, as with any tuberous plant,\r\nhis roots were spread in a rough circular spoke-like pattern that\r\nreached about ten miles in every direction.\r\n\r\nPete Senior, had he tried to dig his plant up, would have been very much\r\nsurprised to find he could not do it. But he didn\'t try, so his life\r\nwent on as usual, with no surprises, which is the way he preferred it,\r\nso he was happy enough.\r\n\r\nIt wasn\'t until his paper had been duly published, and botanical cronies\r\nhad shaken the dust from their whiskers and toddled around to see this\r\nenviable possession, that something of the root structure was\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\n"Seems to spread underground," one remarked.\r\n\r\n"Kind of a lunatic crab-grass," another jibed.\r\n\r\n"Sure you\'re not pulling our leg, Merrill?" said a third. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
"Seems a bit\r\nstunted."\r\n\r\n"Gravity," said Pete Senior. "Not used to it yet."\r\n\r\nThen they all had coffee and cake, shook hands with Pete Senior, and\r\nwent to their homes and laboratories.\r\n\r\nBy this time, of course, at the farthest reaches of Pete\'s root network,\r\nduplicate Petes were popping up above ground, quietly and\r\nunostentatiously (Pete stood barely five inches high), and much like\r\ntheir parent. They, too, began sending out spoke-like root networks.\r\nSome of them, stronger than others, sent roots for a radius of a hundred\r\nmiles, others for a few leagues and no more.\r\n\r\nEventually, Pete Senior reached an age where his body cells died more\r\nrapidly than they were replaced, that is, he achieved old age, and he\r\npassed from his life, leaving a wife, three children, and an unpaid\r\nfertilizer bill.\r\n\r\nPete himself, by now was pulsing considerably faster. In fact,\r\nincredibly faster, after his once-a-century contraction of short years\r\nbefore. His pulse rate was now in the neighborhood of ten per second,\r\nwhich is a pretty good increase. It soon reached hundreds per second.\r\n\r\nAnd his offspring weren\'t far behind him either.\r\n\r\nSince the whole planet was now as interwoven with Pete-type networks as\r\nthe inside of a baseball with string, this constant vibration--which\r\nslowly began to beat in a united concentration--began to make itself\r\nfelt.\r\n\r\nPeople started to complain about it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo scientists with seismographs, and even dousers with willow twigs,\r\nbegan to seek out the source of this unnerving, almost supersonic,\r\nthrilling of the planet crust. Eventually, they located the tiny green\r\nplants with the spirally leaves at the center--the loudest point--of\r\neach network. Someone recognized the plant, and they confirmed this\r\nsomeone\'s suspicions by a check of the Public Library\'s back issues of\r\n_Botanist\'s Quarterly_. It was the moonplant, all right.\r\n\r\nThe Peter W. Merrill Moonplant. Yes sir. That\'s what it was.\r\n\r\nThe public, though, was not satisfied with the finding of a _name_ for\r\nthe disturbance, and insisted that it be brought to a _halt_ somehow.\r\nNaturally, the International Society of Botanists, Biologists and\r\nBiochemists raised one hell of a fuss about this, but on a democratic\r\nplanet they were summarily outvoted, and all spirally little green Peter\r\nW. Merrill Moonplants were--well, not _uprooted_; that would be\r\nimpossible--But they were all cropped flush with the earth wherever\r\nfound, and salt, acid, and all manner of nasty things poured into the\r\nstumps.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHowever, nothing happened at all to the vibrations.\r\n\r\nPeople began to get fidgety, and started petitioning their\r\nrepresentatives in government to _Do Something_. A lot of speeches were\r\nthen made, all over Earth, about the noise and general disturbance of\r\nthe moonplant roots, but none of them offered a solution to the\r\nincreasing racket.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that plumblines started hanging crooked. Oh, it\r\nwasn\'t detected at first. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
How could it be, at first? 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Because you judge\r\nthings by plumblines, not vice-versa. However, in a month, when\r\neverything was about five degrees off the vertical, notice began to be\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\nWhen oranges began rolling off the ground in the California and Florida\r\ngroves, and huddling in a mound here and there upon the countryside, the\r\nSpirit of Worry injected itself into the public consciousness. Niagara\r\nFalls\' spectacular skew-wise splashing toward the Canadian side didn\'t\r\nset many hearts at ease, either.\r\n\r\nAnd then someone remembered the moonplants, and saw that each new\r\napparent gravity-tug was coming from the stump of one of the plants, and\r\na leading scientist figured out the answer, after getting a snipped-off\r\nsegment of moonplant root and testing the hell out of it.\r\n\r\n"It seems," he announced to the world, or that portion of the world that\r\nwas watching his appearance on TV; there being considerable competition\r\nwith a new series of NBC Specials on another channel, "It seems that\r\nthis Peter W. Merrill Moonplant is--er--magnetic, to a certain degree.\r\nThough not magnetism as we know it. It\'s more as though each plant,\r\nthrough the positioning of its roots, and the coiling of same, plus a\r\nheavy concentration of iron in its physical makeup, has managed to make\r\nitself--or, rather, the stump of itself, since all such plants were cut\r\ndown, a short while back--to make itself the center of an artificial\r\ngravity field. This field seems to grow--Rather, these _many_ fields\r\nseem to grow in strength by the hour, and they have a tendency to topple\r\nthings, the gravitational \'tug\' being most disastrous near the centers\r\nof the fields. The rims, though the angle of gravity is sharper there,\r\nare safer for stability only because they are balanced by more \'tugs\'\r\nfrom adjoining fields...."\r\n\r\nWell, he went on this way for an hour or so, and soon his\r\nlisteners--those who stayed tuned in--knew what the problem was: "Down"\r\nwasn\'t going to be "down" much longer. It was going to depend on which\r\nmoonplant stump you happened to be near.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe prospect didn\'t seem too much fun, and people started selling their\r\nhomes and such, and booking passage to the moon, where life was\r\ncontrolled, but carefree, and free of annoying vibrations and rolling\r\noranges.\r\n\r\nLunar Real Estate enjoyed a fabulous boom for weeks after the telecast\r\nby the scientist, but it was soon "all filled up," and further\r\nimmigrations would have to await the construction of more Domes to house\r\nthe newcomers.\r\n\r\nThe laggards, understandably, raised a fuss about this callous attitude,\r\nand went moonward anyway until about two-thirds of the Earth\'s\r\npopulation was on the moon, the place becoming so hopelessly crowded\r\nthat people had to half-rent rooms there, sleeping in alternating shifts\r\nwith other half-renters, and spending their waking hours wandering the\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\n"Things," sighed one realtor to another, "can\'t get much worse."\r\n\r\nAnd that\'s when the first meteor landed on Earth. In the general\r\nexcitement, first about vibrations, then about gravitational fields,\r\nthen about packing up and going to the moon, most newspapers had pushed\r\nto the want-ad pages little articles by eminent astronomers, in which\r\nwere noted the odd behaviors of certain large planetoids in the asteroid\r\nbelt between Earth and Mars. These cosmic hunks of rock seemed to be\r\n"peeling off" the general formation of the ellipse followed by their\r\nfellows, and moving sunward[1] singly or in small homogenous groupings.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: (Ergo: Earthward)]\r\n\r\nWell, the first one landed and left a dent on Earth where the Congo used\r\nto be, the shock being felt as far north as Oslo, to add to their\r\nvibrational, gravitational and evacuational difficulties.\r\n\r\nScientists on the moon--being as singleminded as scientists\r\nanywhere--became ecstatic. At last the mystery of the ages was solved:\r\nWho put the pocks in the face of the moon? A Peter W. Merrill Moonplant,\r\nof course! They looked down in rapture as meteor after meteor--drawn\r\nacross the countless miles of space by the pulsating gravity fields,\r\nplunged into the Earth, leaving pocks visible to the naked moondweller\'s\r\neye. And darned if each meteor didn\'t strike dead center of each plant\r\nnetwork.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter about a month, Earth looked almost exactly like the moon had once\r\nlooked, with the exception of one locale: Australia, and much of the\r\nPacific Ocean surrounding it.\r\n\r\n"It will indeed be a titanic meteor that hits there!" the moon\r\nscientists enthused. For their careful check of the records showed that\r\nonly one plant had been found on the whole continent of Australia,\r\ntoward the eastern coast; which meant that its network probably extended\r\nbeneath the Pacific itself, with a gigantic field reaching its hungry\r\nmagnetic fingers into space.\r\n\r\nAnd then someone noticed that no more asteroids had peeled from the\r\nformation. The void between the asteroid belt and Earth was barren of\r\nhurtling rock.\r\n\r\n"Wonderful!" the scientists enthused. "It means that each field down\r\nthere on Earth ceased its tug the moment its meteor struck it. That\r\nmeans that once the final meteor lands, the Peter W. Merrill Moonplant\r\nwill be dead, and we can get some of the crowd off this place. Earth\'s a\r\nbit ragged-looking, but after all, it\'s Home."\r\n\r\n"Funny," said one of the younger scientists, "that the moonplant went so\r\nfar afield for meteors, and yet did not disturb the delicate\r\ngravitational balance between Earth and the moon, its own Satellite."\r\n\r\n"Let us hope," said an older scientist, "that this enormous Australian\r\nnetwork has not been saving itself for us." He laughed at this little\r\npleasantry, but no one joined him, because someone had just peered\r\nthrough a telescope and noticed that Australia seemed to be getting\r\nlarger.\r\n\r\n"You know what?" said the young scientist, finally. "We\'re falling to\r\nthe Earth, to form the largest pockmark of all!"\r\n\r\n"What a spectacle!" cried another scientist. "Pity we won\'t be alive to\r\nwitness it. I wonder why the Peter W. Merrill Moonplant saved us for\r\nlast?"\r\n\r\n"Possibly," said the young scientist, "because--as with a wedding--the\r\ngroom asks all his relatives to come and see him married, and finally\r\npicks out the person who is to be the Best Man. The moonplant probably\r\nconsiders the moon an old buddy."\r\n\r\nThe older scientists, however, gave this statement the stoniest of\r\nnon-replies, and refused even to speak to the hapless young man for the\r\nduration of their journey downward to squashy death against the home\r\nplanet.\r\n\r\nRomanticism and Science just don\'t mix.\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s Old Friends Are the Best, by Jack Sharkey\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
