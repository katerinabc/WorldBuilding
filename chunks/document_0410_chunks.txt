These were more than he could suffer....\r\n\r\n\r\nGr-r-r! 

=== Chunk 3 ===
There he goes again! Brother Ambrose could scarce restrain the\r\nhatred that seethed and churned in his breast, as his smallish eyes\r\nfollowed Brother Lorenzo headed once more for his beloved geraniums, the\r\ninevitable watering-pot gripped in both hands, the inevitable devotions\r\nrising in a whispered stream from his saintly lips. The very fact the\r\nman lived was a mockery to human justice: God\'s blood, but if thoughts\r\ncould only kill.\r\n\r\n_Ave, Virgo!_\r\n\r\nThe thousand and one injuries of Fray Lorenzo he had borne as a\r\nChristian monk should, with humility and charity. But the insults, aye,\r\nthe insults to faith and reason! They were more than a generous Father\r\ncould expect His most adoring servant to suffer, weren\'t they? To have\r\nto sit next to the man, for instance, at evening meal and hear his silly\r\nprattle of the weather. Next year\'s crop of cork: we can scarcely expect\r\noak-galls, he says. Isn\'t _petroselinum_ the name for parsley? (No,\r\nit\'s Greek, you swine. And what\'s the Greek name for Swine\'s Snout? I\r\ncould hurl it at you, like the Pope hurling anathema.) 

=== Chunk 4 ===
_Salve tibi!_ It\r\nsticks in one\'s craw to bless him with the rest. Would God our cloister\r\nnumbered thirty-and-nine instead of forty.\r\n\r\nFor days now, for weeks, Brother Ambrose had witnessed and endured the\r\nfalse piety of the man. How he\'d ever got admitted to the order in the\r\nfirst place beat all supposition. It must have been his sanctimonious\r\napple-cheeks or (Heaven forbid such simony), some rich relative greased\r\nthe palm of the Prior. _Saint, forsooth!_\r\n\r\nBrother Ambrose recalled just a week previous; they had been outside the\r\nwalls, a round dozen of the brothers, gathering the first few bushels of\r\ngrapes to make the good Benedictine wine. And all men tended to their\r\nduty in the vineyard--save who? Save lecherous Lorenzo, whose job was to\r\nattend the press. Picked the assignment himself, most likely, so he\r\ncould ogle the brown thighs and browner ankles of Dolores squatting on\r\nthe Convent bank, _gitana_ slut with her flashing eyes and hint of sweet\r\ndelight in those cherry-red lips and coquettish tossing shoulders. A man\r\ncould see she was child of the devil, flesh to tempt to eternal\r\nhellfire.\r\n\r\nBut how skillful Brother Lorenzo had been in keeping the glow in his\r\ndead eye from being seen by the others! Only Ambrose had known it was\r\nthere. Invisible to even the world, perhaps; but lurking just the same\r\nin Lorenzo\'s feverishly disguised brain. _Si_, there and lusting beyond\r\na doubt. By one\'s faith, the blue-black hair of Dolores would make any\r\nweak man itch; and the stories that had floated on the breeze that day,\r\nlivelily exchanged between her and that roguish Sanchicha, the\r\n_lavandera_; Lorenzo must surely have lapped them all up like a hungry\r\nspaniel, though he cleverly turned his head away so you would not guess.\r\nAfter all, Ambrose, scarcely a step closer, could recall clearly every\r\nword of the bawdy tales!\r\n\r\nBack to the table again; and Brother Ambrose once more noticed how Fray\r\nLorenzo never let his fork and knife lie crosswise, an obvious tribute\r\nhe, himself, always made in Our Senor\'s praise. Nor did Lorenzo honor\r\nthe Trinity by drinking his orange-pulp in three quiet sips; rather (the\r\nArian heretic) he drained it at a gulp. Now, he was out trimming his\r\nmyrtle-bush.

And touching up his roses.\r\n\r\nGr-r-r, again! Watching his enemy putter away in the deepening twilight\r\nthat followed the decline of the Andalusian sun, Brother Ambrose\r\nrecalled the other traps he had lain to trip the hypocrite. Traps set\r\nand failed; but, oh, so delicious anyhow, these attempts to send him\r\nflying off to Hell where he belonged: a Cathar or a Manichee. That last\r\none, involving the pornographic French novel so scrofulous and wicked.\r\nHow could it failed to have snared its prey? Especially, when Fray\r\nAmbrose had spent such sleepless nights, working out his plot in great\r\ndetail?\r\n\r\nBrother Ambrose allowed himself an inward chortle, as he paced along the\r\nportico, recollecting how close to success the scheme had come. The book\r\nhad had to be read first (or re-read, rather) by Ambrose to determine\r\njust which chapter would be most apt to damn a soul with concupiscent\r\nsuggestion. Gray paper with blunt type, the whole book had been easy\r\nenough to grasp for that matter--what with the words so badly spelled\r\nout. The cuckoldry tales of Boccaccio and that gay old archpriest, Juan\r\nRuiz de Hita, what dry reading they seemed by comparison--almost like\r\ndecretals.\r\n\r\nAs if by misadventure, Brother Ambrose had left the book in Lorenzo\'s\r\ncell, the pages doubled down at the woeful sixteenth print. Ah, there\r\nhad been a passage! Simply glancing at it, you groveled hand and foot in\r\nBelial\'s grip.\r\n\r\nBut, that twice-cursed Lorenzo must have had the devil\'s luck that day.\r\nA breeze sprang up to flip the volume closed; and the monk, not knowing\r\nthe book\'s owner and espying only its name, had handed it over to the\r\nPrior who had promptly turned the monastery upside down in search of\r\nfurther such adulterous contraband!\r\n\r\nWorse fortune followed. The next day, Brother Lorenzo had come down with\r\na temporary stroke of blindness--it lasted only a week; but even so, for\r\nseven days Ambrose had been forced to labor in his stead in the drafty\r\nlibrary, copying boresome scrolls in a light scarcely less dim than\r\nmoonlight. Worse still, the Prior had found mistakes: letters dropped,\r\ntransposed (Latin was so bothersomely regular; compared to the vulgar\r\ntongue). For what he called such "inexcusable slovenliness," the Prior\r\nhad imposed a penance of bread and water and extra toil.\r\n\r\n_Slovenliness!_ Why didn\'t the Prior--was he blind, too?--notice the\r\ndeadly sins that were each day so neatly practised by Brother Lorenzo?\r\nThey went unpunished. Probably, God\'s Angel would even be found to have\r\nbeen asleep when Judgment Day came around and Lorenzo would slip into\r\nHeaven by a wink, as one might say.\r\n\r\nObviously, there was no justice, except such as man would make himself,\r\nBrother Ambrose had at last decided.\r\n\r\n_Ave Maria, plena gratia._\r\n\r\nNow at last, he was alone in his cell, free finally from the unendurable\r\n(sometimes it seemed everlasting) torment of Brother Lorenzo\'s presence.\r\nTwenty-nine distinct damnations listed in Galatians, if you cared to\r\nlook up the text; and not one of them could the enemy be made to trip\r\non, a-dying.\r\n\r\nIn fact, of late, so bad had the situation grown that Brother Ambrose\r\nhad even once considered pledging his soul to Satan. Oh, not for keeps!\r\nNo enmity was worth that dread sacrifice. But as a trick, sort of--with\r\na flaw in the indenture that proud Lucifer would miss until it was too\r\nlate to wriggle out of the bargain.\r\n\r\nBut that had been two days ago.\r\n\r\nNow, a better scheme presented itself to Brother Ambrose, engendered by\r\nthat forced labor within the dreary precincts of the convent library.\r\nFor that was where (and when) he had made his delightful discovery, the\r\none that would now redeem him from all his irritations and travail. The\r\ndiscovery that would rid him of Brother Lorenzo for always!\r\n\r\nIt had happened like this.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the monastery was over eight hundred years old, many ancient\r\nbooks and moldy scrolls lay forgotten in the cobwebby corners of the\r\ngreat library, especially where the light was gloomy. One afternoon\r\nduring his week of enforced toil, Brother Ambrose had sought the shelter\r\nof one of these ill-lighted and seldom-visited nooks of the building to\r\nrecover certain lost hours of sleep, hours that had gone astray the\r\nnight before as he sat up in his lonely cell and brooded over his\r\nwrongs. But before his drowsy head could nod off into dreams completely,\r\nhis eye had chanced to notice a faded scroll that jutted forth from its\r\nfellows on the shelves. Starting to push the offender back in place,\r\nAmbrose\'s fingers had hesitated when he noticed the title: _De\r\nNecromantiae_.\r\n\r\nSurely, thought the monk, such a book belonged on the Index. Then, it\r\noccurred to him that possibly the copy in front of him was the only one\r\nof its kind in the world, in which case not even the Holy Father could\r\nbe expected to know it existed. Then, how could it be on the Index or be\r\nforbidden?\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of this personal achievement in casuistry, Brother\r\nAmbrose promptly untied the scroll and began reading.\r\n\r\nWhat he discovered there interested him very much. We do not intend to\r\ndescribe all of the marvels unfolded for him in that venerable mildewed\r\nmanuscript, for some of the more gruesome mysteries of the supernatural\r\nworld are better left unrevealed; but let it be said at least, that one\r\nchapter intrigued Brother Ambrose immensely. So much so, that he\r\nshamelessly whipped out his scissors and, nipping that section, stuck it\r\ninside his rough wool robes so he might peruse it at greater leisure\r\nwithin the privacy of his cell.\r\n\r\nThe chapter that evoked such delight and interest within Brother\r\nAmbrose\'s complicated brain was one that had been penned in the early\r\nages of the Church by a lay-brother who had concerned himself with pagan\r\nmagic. In it, he had described the fiendish habits and activities of\r\nwerewolves and had actually even presented a formula. _Ut Fiat Homo\r\nLupinus_ it was entitled, which purported to give the secret words and\r\nritual necessary to achieve the transformation from man to beast.\r\n\r\nAt last, the opportunity had arrived Ambrose\'s way to achieve his\r\nlong-desired revenge on Brother Lorenzo!\r\n\r\nTwenty-four hours had passed since the momentous discovery. The moment\r\nwas at hand. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Night again had settled upon the Spanish cloisters, the\r\nlast bell had tolled; and all the good and hardy men were supposed to be\r\nat sound sleep on their rough iron cots. But in Brother Ambrose\'s chilly\r\ncell, a small candle burned--casting sickly light that produced huge\r\nflickering shadows against the whitewashed walls.\r\n\r\nBrother Ambrose held the treasured piece of manuscript between his\r\nhands. It was difficult to make out the faded Latin; the writing was\r\ncramped and crude, and Ambrose was no scholar to boot. But like all\r\npersons of his times, he was quite well-aware of the existence of\r\nwerewolves, werefoxes, and other such monsters; and he held no doubt but\r\nwhat the spell would work.\r\n\r\nIt was the scheming brother\'s plan to creep in the stealth of night down\r\nthe corridor to the barred oak door of Lorenzo\'s own simple cell. There,\r\nhe would knock; lightly enough to disturb no other sleepers, yet loud\r\nenough that the rapping would summon Brother Lorenzo from whatever\r\nwicked dreams might be festering in his own sleeping mind.\r\n\r\nAs Fray Lorenzo\'s naked footsteps were heard pattering across the bare\r\nfloor, Ambrose would drink the bat\'s blood he had collected, sniff the\r\nwolfbane he had ground to ash, and pronounce the obscure Celtic words\r\nthat would alter the very atoms of his flesh, transforming them into an\r\nobscene travesty of life. Brother Lorenzo, when he opened the door,\r\nwould be met not by a fellow human being, but by a snarling fanged wolf\r\nthat would hurl its hairy bulk at the drowsy monk\'s own throat.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the entire monastery would be awakened, of course, by\r\nshouts of the news that foul murder had been discovered. But no amount\r\nof detection would ever manifest the bestial murderer. Brother Ambrose\r\nwould hug to his soul the secret of his crime until the day of his\r\nshriving.\r\n\r\nAt length, the hour had grown so late that it was certain even the Prior\r\nhimself must have long since retired.\r\n\r\nBrother Ambrose made ready to carry out his deed. He rose from his cot,\r\nremoved the coarse brown robe that normally he wore to bed as well as in\r\nhis daily rounds so that his long-unwashed body stood naked. There must\r\nbe no chance for tell-tale blood to stain his clothes, when his fierce\r\ntalons and wolfish teeth tore and rended at human flesh.\r\n\r\nCarrying his precious piece of scroll, he departed from his cell and\r\ngroped his way down the stone corridor until the light improved enough\r\nfor him to see his way. Luckily, a patch of moonlight illuminated the\r\nvery space in front of the accursed Brother Lorenzo\'s door. What\r\nfortune!\r\n\r\nBrother Ambrose halted and stared at the door as though his eyes could\r\nsee through it, at the sleeping form within. He sucked in a deep breath.\r\nHis palms were sweaty; his heartbeat rapid. For a moment, he was almost\r\nready to back out.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly, the memory of all the hundreds of grudges he bore against\r\nLorenzo surged through him. Hatred built up a massive reservoir, that\r\nbroke out over his crumbling conscience and flooded his body with anger\r\nand wild resentment. His teeth gritted. What had he been thinking of--to\r\nretreat now, with revenge so nearly at hand!\r\n\r\nHe rapped. A moment later, he heard a creaking sound like Brother\r\nLorenzo slipping out of bed.\r\n\r\nTrembling, he lifted the phial of bat\'s blood, drank it down. It tasted\r\nsalty. He chewed on the wolfbane powder until it mixed with the saliva\r\nof his mouth, then he swallowed. Holding the ancient scroll-segment\r\nbefore him, he began to repeat the badly-written incantation: _Ut fiat\r\nhomo lupinus, pulvis arnicae facenda est et dum...._\r\n\r\nA thousand jolts assailed his body, as if he had been struck by all the\r\nlightnings in heaven. Then, came a rushing paralysis, a distortion of\r\ntime and space, a dread feeling of disintegration and death ...\r\n\r\nThe door to Brother Lorenzo\'s cell began to recede, swelling in volume\r\nas it did. The ceiling of the corridor likewise retreated at\r\never-increasing pace. Staring down at his own dwindling frame, Ambrose\r\nsaw that the slug-white flesh was now covered with thick fur, even as\r\nthe limbs were gnarling--\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly the door opened. Brother Lorenzo stepped out, his kindly\r\npious face wrinkled with sleep but otherwise showing no irritation or\r\ndispleasure at being summoned from his rest. At first, the monk seemed\r\nnot to have noticed Ambrose\'s form, for he gazed above him and away.\r\n\r\nAmbrose kept on shrinking.\r\n\r\nFinally, Brother Lorenzo\'s gaze chanced to glance downward. But still,\r\nhis features mirrored no recognition or alarm; only puzzlement.\r\n\r\n_Now_, thought Ambrose, _now is the time for me to snarl_.\r\n\r\nBut no snarl, nor semblance of a snarl, emerged from his lips. Rather,\r\nhis lips had elongated into long sucking proboscises, while already a\r\nthird pair of limbs had commenced growing from his furred-over abdomen.\r\n\r\nThis was not a wolf-like form, he was assuming, Ambrose suddenly\r\nrealized in terror. But if it was not lupine, what was it? Had he\r\nmisread the incantation? Had he mispronounced a simple word?\r\n\r\nThe weird crawling form into which he had metamorphosed was now hardly\r\nan inch higher than the surface of the floor. But Ambrose\'s eyes had\r\nbulged into great many-faceted orbs capable of seeing objects with\r\ngreater clarity than ever. Inches away from him, he made out the segment\r\nof scroll he had discarded after reading aloud from it. Crawling over to\r\nit, he perused the beginning words of the spell.\r\n\r\nAnd it suddenly dawned on him (while what passed for a heart and\r\nventricles within his pulpy form began simulating horror) that the\r\nancient monk of centuries ago who had first copied the incantation must\r\nhave been as careless of spelling as he. For the charm obviously did not\r\nconvert its user into a werewolf, but rather some other animal ...\r\n\r\nDredging up all the miserable Latin he knew, Ambrose fished for some\r\nword similar to _lupinus_.\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly he had it!\r\n\r\n_Pulicus!_ That was the word the sloppy copyist of yesteryear had\r\nwrongly transcribed.\r\n\r\nFrom the word _pulex_, meaning "flea."\r\n\r\nNot how to become a wolf-like man, but a flea-like man--that was what\r\nthe formula had described.\r\n\r\nAmbrose, the flea, braced himself. Gathering his powerful legs under\r\nhim, he leaped in soaring flight to land upon the object of hatred--the\r\ngiant Brother Lorenzo, who towered so high above him.\r\n\r\nBut the gentle and considerate Brother Lorenzo, who probably would not\r\nhave hurt hair nor hide of any other creature on Earth--even he knew\r\nfull well that there is only one thing you can do to discourage a flea.\r\n\r\nSwat!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ January 1957.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.
