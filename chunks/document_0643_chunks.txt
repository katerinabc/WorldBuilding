=== Chunk 2 ===
Do you get it?\r\n    We didn\'t either until we read the story. Read the yarn and you\'ll\r\n    get it too._\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough Divine intervention in human affairs passed into the realm of\r\nthe mythical toward the end of the twentieth or at the dawn of the\r\ntwenty-first century, one is almost inclined to give thanks to the\r\nSupernatural for the marvelous efficacy of Dr. Rutledge\'s discovery and\r\nstratagem which so recently freed us from the Oriental menace.\r\n\r\nA year ago only the Mississippi and the most severe winter in many\r\ngenerations was staying the complete invasion of the United States. In\r\nan unbelievably secret manner our enemies had for five decades been\r\ndeveloping a scientific offensive against which our laboratories could\r\nnot in a short interval protect us. The vast and fundamental discoveries\r\nmade during the past hundred years by the Orientals (and now the\r\nheritage of the whole world) can only be compared to the Industrial\r\nRevolution of the nineteenth century. Without warning, through the\r\ndiscovery of the cause of gravitation, the Mongols practically lifted\r\ntheir Nangsi metal transports (which were built of a material combining\r\nthe lightness of aluminum with the strength and hardness of steel) out\r\nof the sea; and in five days skimmed across the surface of the Pacific.\r\nThe whole West lay at their mercy, though we know with what gallantry\r\ntheir forces were held in check from summer until winter, when the enemy\r\nhad reached the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: They were planning details of the final campaign.]\r\n\r\nOf course, one of the surprises which the Orientals had not counted on\r\nwas the providential inspiration of Dr. Mernick of the Hopkins, who\r\ndevised the now famous Mernickian transformer by which light from the\r\nsun, received through a series of grates, is stepped from the\r\nwavelengths of light into those of electricity. This gave us a sudden\r\nlimitless source of power on which the enemy had not counted. It\r\nvirtually lifted our forces off the ground and made them almost the\r\nequal of an enemy who had succeeded in neutralizing the gravitational\r\ndrag.\r\n\r\nThe final and most disastrous card our subtle enemies played was dealt\r\non the prairies in Nebraska. They themselves were afraid of their weapon\r\nand wanted plenty of space to try it in. I was personally present at its\r\ndebut, being at the time in General Sanford\'s stationary observing\r\nhelicopter which, through the agency of the power supplied by a\r\nMernickian transformer, hung motionless as a bee fifteen thousand feet\r\nin the air. Only the treble hum of the air turbine could be heard\r\nfaintly through the transparent walls of the observatory constructed of\r\nthe annealed clersite, which has taken the place of the unsatisfactory\r\nglass used by our forefathers. The toughness and tensile strength of\r\nthis element, comparable to the best chrome steels, combined with its\r\ncrystal clarity, made an ideal warfare observation unit. It was\r\npractically invisible and likewise quite bullet proof. The great\r\nstrength of the material in our machine, and the rapidity with which we\r\ncould rise and fall, indeed made us difficult prey. In addition to this\r\nwe were hanging behind the great electric field that the Radio Defensive\r\nCorps had spread like a screen before our forces, greatly to the\r\nembarrassment of the enemy in the use of his anti-gravitational\r\nmachines.\r\n\r\nAs we stood at our posts, we saw the great degravitated bombs hurtled\r\nagainst our lines suddenly come into contact with the fan-like electric\r\nfield, somersault a few times and fall. At the edge of the electric\r\nscreen the ground was excavated to an enormous depth by the bursting of\r\nthese intercepted degravitated bombs, most of which had been projected\r\nfrom stationary batteries three or four hundred miles behind the enemy\r\nlines. The local batteries bombarding with the old fashioned Sangsi\r\nsteel shell were still effective. On the whole, however, from our own\r\nobservation of the local front and from the television reports we were\r\nconstantly receiving, we judged that the American and Allied Caucasian\r\nforces were more than holding their own.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sanford, the Chief of the Signal Corps, who stood by my side,\r\ngrasped my arm, and pointed to the west. Everyone crowded to our side in\r\nexcitement. Before we could gasp our amazement, the incandescent spot\r\nwhich our Chief had mutely indicated on the distant horizon, zoomed in a\r\nblazing arc across our zenith and plunged into the terrain of the\r\nEnglish forces which were occupying the little town of Ogallala about\r\nsix miles to our south. We held our breath. What next?\r\n\r\nOnly a faint throbbing seemed to pulse in the air above the spot where\r\nthe missile sank. I was about to pronounce the diagnosis of "a dud,"\r\nwhen someone cried, "My God, General, they\'ve turned hell loose this\r\ntime!" The whole atmosphere for a quarter of a mile radius about the\r\nfatal bomb quivered as over a heated griddle. Even as we remarked this,\r\nthe area began to glow cherry red. A deafening thunder assaulted our\r\nears when to our horror the earth on which had stood the now burning\r\ntown of Ogallala, rose a gigantic incandescent ball and shot like a\r\nmeteor into the heavens. Our car was a feather tossed in the ensuing\r\nhurricane, but even while we bobbed back and forth there was an\r\near-splitting explosion as the land that was once an American village\r\nburst into a blinding blue flare of hydrogen flame twenty-five miles\r\nabove us.\r\n\r\nThe swaying of the car gradually subsided in the tortured atmosphere,\r\nand a gentle rain began to fall. Ogallala had been chemically "stepped\r\ndown" into the most primitive element, combined with the oxygen above\r\nand was condensing back to earth again as a few globules of H2O. That\r\nday was a sort of crisis; the enemy had discovered and turned upon us\r\nthe power of atomic degeneration! And I, as assistant chief chemist of\r\nthe American Army, felt my heart become heavy within me as I soared back\r\nto the Central Laboratory.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEven as I watched the advent of the electronic detonator two days\r\npreviously the inspiration had come to me. What had happened to the\r\ndoomed Nebraskan town had been so obvious. Through some unexplained\r\nagency discovered by the Orientals, the electronic restraint of the\r\nnormally stable elements had been removed. In a brief time Ogallala had\r\ndegenerated through all the steps of the periodic table until it became\r\nhydrogen, at which point, owing to the terrific air current and\r\nincandescent heat, it had recombined with the oxygen of the air as\r\nsimple molecules of water.\r\n\r\nI thought I had a clue as to how it had been accomplished. The Central\r\nChemical Laboratory was the focus of feverish excitement. The air was\r\ntense with the expectancy of tremendous things. Every scientist there\r\nfelt that we were on the verge of discovering the principle of the\r\nMongols\' new weapon. "Give us time!" "Time" was the plea we sent daily\r\nto the Defense Headquarters. "Only six weeks more, only a month," we\r\nbegged, "and then we\'ll make a boomerang out of the enemy\'s invention."\r\nAnderson, Mahaffey, Dr. Spritz--all the great physicists and chemists of\r\nthe present age--labored at my side endeavoring to trick Nature into\r\ngiving us that saving secret.\r\n\r\nThe television \'phone called my name. I immediately hurried to the booth\r\nand saw General Loomis, the Commander-in-Chief of the American and\r\nCaucasian Armies, standing in his helicopter headquarters. He seemed\r\nhaggard and worn. "How much longer, Johnson?" he asked. "The enemy has\r\npretty well eaten out the country and with the advent of winter and lack\r\nof food, are bending all their efforts to crush us. Besides, we cannot\r\ntell just how long it will be before they begin turning out their new\r\nbomb in other than experimental quantities. Two weeks, I should\r\nestimate, is about all the longer I can hold them."\r\n\r\n"If that is the case, General Loomis," I replied, "we may as well give\r\nup. Two months will see us ready. But two weeks--!"\r\n\r\nI felt a hand laid on my shoulder. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Dr. Rutledge, my science chief, had\r\nstepped into the booth behind me and overheard the conversation.\r\n\r\n"General Loomis," Dr. Rutledge spoke, looking for all the world like a\r\npatriarch of olden times, "until five minutes ago what Johnson has just\r\nsaid would have sealed our fate. But now, I think, I believe, we have\r\none more card to play. I have only this moment completed a series of\r\nreactions which have resulted (as I calculated they should) in the\r\nproduction of a new protein, similar in appearance to flour. It should,\r\nalthough of course I have not yet had time to verify this statement, be\r\na practical substitute for flour; and indeed, it is my belief that it\r\nwill easily be mistaken for that substance. Its particles are laminated\r\nsimilar to starch, of an identical size, and the nutritive factor should\r\nbe greater than that of bread. It is, in short, a new, a foreign protein\r\nnever before found in this world of men!"\r\n\r\n"Very interesting, I am sure," replied General Loomis, with a trace of\r\nbitterness and sarcasm in his voice. "Your noble efforts will result in\r\nfeeding the yellow devils an excellent artificial fare. They will be\r\ngrateful, I know!"\r\n\r\n"Exactly my object, general," Dr. Rutledge replied. He continued\r\nimpressively: "You have until now relied upon me largely in the waging\r\nof this war to save the white race from the menace of the yellow. Since\r\nall is lost at any rate, grant me one last effort in behalf of my\r\ncountry. At all costs, Loomis, hold your present lines for two days,\r\npreparing to suddenly retire to the west bank of the Mississippi. I\r\nleave it to your strategy to make a sudden retreat (which should extend\r\nover a period of at least ten days) appear as if enforced by the enemy\r\nthemselves."\r\n\r\n"There should be no difficulty in that direction," General Loomis\r\ninterpolated, smiling wryly on the television screen.\r\n\r\n"Once on the west bank," went on Dr. Rutledge seriously, not noticing\r\nthe interjection, "make a stand for a day or two and then suddenly\r\nretreat across the river to the east bank as if again forced to do so.\r\nNow, General, two days from this time--before your retreat begins--I\r\nshall, I trust, have your armies all along the lines supplied with my\r\nnew artificial, foreign protein flour. This you will leave in the\r\nenemy\'s hands, which, you have intimated, will be much to their delight.\r\nYou will do the same at the stand which for a while you held on the west\r\nbank. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
But, mind you, let none of your men use any of this perfectly\r\nharmless food. I will personally see to it that you will receive it in\r\nsuch containers that none will come in contact with your persons."\r\n\r\n"Doctor," Loomis said after staring at the old scientist some time in\r\nastonishment, "except for years of personal acquaintance, I would say\r\nthat you were suffering a mental shock. Knowing you as I do, however, I\r\npray to God you\'re making no mistake this time. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
I\'ll do as you wish."\r\nHis figure faded from the screen.\r\n\r\nThe next fortnight was one of black despair. I myself doubted on\r\noccasions whether or not the old doctor was mentally accountable--even I\r\nwho had trusted him so long. General Loomis and his staff called up\r\ndaily to inquire if Dr. Rutledge had any change of plans. As for the\r\narmy and the populace, they were one in calling on the President to make\r\nterms with the enemy. The allies truly were on the point of collapse.\r\nAll that kept up what morale was left in the chemical division was the\r\nunrelenting demands made on us by Dr. Rutledge to continue to ferret out\r\nthe electronic detonator. Until then, he had scarcely bothered with our\r\nwork; now he would hear of nothing else. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
"Today\'s the Day!" was the\r\nslogan he had displayed above every bench.\r\n\r\nFinally the fatal day arrived. The retreat across the Mississippi was\r\nconsummated. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
This time it was not feigned. The Mongols were hungry, and\r\ntheir appetites were whetted for more flour such as had sustained them\r\nfor the past twelve days. Moreover, new electronic bombs were beginning\r\nto be supplied them.\r\n\r\nMy name leapt at me across the room: I was being called by that almost\r\nhuman instrument, the television \'phone. Both my superior and I hurried\r\nto the cabinet. It was, as we had guessed, Loomis. "It\'s all up," he\r\nsaid wretchedly. "The fresh supply of atomic degenerating bombs, for\r\nwhich the enemy has been holding back, has now arrived. They matched and\r\nneutralized our electric field defense screen just an hour ago, leaving\r\nus at their mercy. You\'ve had your chance, Doctor, and failed. I advise\r\nyou both to make your way north and wait until these fiends forget the\r\ninconvenience you both have caused them. As for me, I\'m leaving this\r\ninstant to offer unconditional surrender in the name of all the allies."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was about ten o\'clock in the morning, just after he had transported\r\nall his forces hurriedly to the east bank, and as the Mongols were\r\noccupying the old entrenchments on the west, that General Loomis closed\r\nhis conversation with the Chemical Laboratory. He turned to an aerial\r\nofficer who stood at attention beside him. "Major Maniu," he said,\r\n"trail a white banner of truce on your plane and tell the enemy I will\r\nparley with them. Tell them that we will serve rations presently to our\r\nmen who have worked all night without food or rest, and that if it is\r\nagreeable to them, both sides shall simultaneously discontinue activity\r\nat one o\'clock. At that time I shall cross the river to offer them our\r\nterms of surrender."\r\n\r\nThe officer saluted and hastened to his near-by plane. General Loomis\r\nascended into his helicopter to confer with his staff to draw up in\r\ndocumentary form the surrender, and give the necessary orders relative\r\nto lowering of fire that afternoon. He also spoke to the President and\r\nto the crowd outside the White House, and then began nervously waiting\r\nthe crucial moment. About twelve-thirty, however, a remarkable fact\r\nforced itself on his attention. Whereas the allied batteries continued\r\nto thunder away, the fire from the Orientals became irregular and\r\nsporadic. "Celebrating their victory beforehand," the French commander\r\nremarked bitterly to his chief. Loomis nodded. "And getting careless,\r\ntoo," another of the Staff added as he saw one of the enemy\'s detonator\r\nbombs disintegrate three or four hundred acres of a Mongolian base\r\nencampment fifty miles to the northwest and shoot it a monstrous blazing\r\nrocket twenty or thirty miles into the midday sky.\r\n\r\nBy twelve forty-five the enemy\'s barrage had fallen completely all along\r\nthe line. Our battery nevertheless continued until the set time but\r\nelicited no answer. Exactly at one General Loomis with two aides stepped\r\ninto his air-car. He was a picture of grief and despair. Three minutes\r\nlate the party landed forty miles across the river before the\r\nheadquarters and armored dining hall of the Oriental General Staff.\r\n\r\nLoomis and his officers stepped out of their car and looked about. No\r\none was in sight. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
Not even a sentry guarded the mess room door. The\r\nGeneral paced back and forth a few minutes in indecision.\r\n\r\n"Evidently they mean to make us feel our defeat," he said. "They\r\napparently do not even think it further necessary to observe rudimentary\r\ndiplomatic courtesy. Come on, boys, beggars can\'t be choosers, as the\r\nantique saying goes." He led the way to the dining hall through a window\r\nof which a light was seen shining.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps if we find his xanthic highness after a good meal he will be\r\ninclined to be a bit more lenient," Loomis whispered with a forced\r\nlaugh, trying to cheer his glum companions.\r\n\r\nHe opened the unguarded door of the hall. An instant later he reeled\r\nback horror-stricken. Instead of a feasting gathering of officers\r\nattached to the Mongolian Staff he saw before a feast of men contorted\r\nin grotesque shapes by some violent death. Many lay beside the table,\r\nsome on it, their faces blotched with great, unsightly wheals, their\r\nchests bloated until they seemed about to burst. Only one poor wretch\r\nhad any life left in him--he lay exhausted on the floor with great\r\nstreams of frothy mucous pouring from his nose and throat.\r\n\r\nA possibility dawned in Loomis\' mind. He dashed away to search the other\r\nmess tents, shouting to his aides to follow suit. It was as he guessed:\r\nthey had landed in a camp of dead and dying; stricken by some mysterious\r\npower. Hope suddenly surged back into his soul. He felt dizzy and faint.\r\nCould a similar fate have caused the unaccountable silence of the\r\nenemy\'s cannonade? Even as the thought came to him, he knew it must be\r\nso. His marvelous old friend, Dr. Rutledge, had risen to the need of the\r\nworld and crushed the yellow menace.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch, truly, had been the case. In a single hour, through the agency of\r\na harmless food, the subtle scientist had crushed a nation. The\r\nprinciple involved had been discovered nearly two centuries before, when\r\nit was well-known that if an animal were injected with a small quantity\r\nof a protein foreign to his body, a subsequent dose a hundred million\r\ntimes as weak would cause its immediate and violent death. Even the\r\nquantity that might be flying in the atmosphere and become dissolved in\r\nthe fluids of the nose or eyes would act as the most virulent of known\r\npoisons. Through the ages, however, the human race had more or less come\r\nin contact with all the proteins in their world and hence rarely became\r\nhighly sensitized to any protein occurring in nature. The terrible\r\ntoxicity of a protein which had never before occurred in nature and to\r\nwhose power mankind had never been even partially desensitized had up to\r\nthe time of Dr. Rutledge only entered the minds of a few scientists. His\r\nstrategy was the working out of a new maxim: Nature is terrible, but man\r\nmakes it more so.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nForeign protein sensitization or anaphylaxis was the basis of Dr.\r\nRutledge\'s coup. The laws governing this reaction had been more or less\r\nworked out by a group of scientists in the twentieth century. They had\r\ndemonstrated that if a guinea-pig or rabbit were injected with the blood\r\nserum of another species, a subsequent dose of an infinitely small\r\nquantity of this substance would cause convulsions, collapse and rapid\r\ndeath. Inasmuch as there were many proteins in the atmosphere at that\r\ntime due to the unrestrained pollination of plants of every description,\r\nit was not surprising that they found as many as ten per cent of the\r\nwhite race afflicted with a slight pollen sensitivity which showed up\r\nseasonally by causing spasms of the smooth muscle of the respiratory\r\nsystem, a disease popularly called "hay-fever."\r\n\r\nSince, however, the proteins of the world had always been present, the\r\nhuman race had, by constantly coming into contact with them, become more\r\nor less immunized to the majority. Only occasionally a case of violent\r\nsensitivity came to light and was recognized as such. Two or three cases\r\nthere had been which the old scientist discovered while searching the\r\narchives of ancient medicine and these gave him the clew he needed.\r\n\r\nOne was the case of a little girl who had somehow or other become\r\nsensitized to the protein of wasp toxin and who suffered almost\r\nimmediate death from anaphylactic "choc" as the result of being stung by\r\nthat insect. A second instance concerned a woman who went into violent\r\nasthmatic paroxysms if a mouse entered the room where she was, and whose\r\nskin broke out into large wheals if touched with mouse hair. Finally,\r\nand most outstanding in his mind, was the case of a child who was\r\nthought to be sensitive to the fish protein in glue and who died almost\r\nimmediately when the physician testing her had brought a small quantity\r\nof the dry protein into contact with a scratch on her arm.\r\n\r\nThese had, however, been rare cases, but they pointed out the method. It\r\nhad already been proved over and over again that animals could be\r\nsensitized experimentally by treating them with foreign proteins,\r\nprovided that after the initial dose they did not come into contact with\r\nthe same protein until after a lapse of about two weeks. If they\r\nhappened to do so the first injection or treatment was frequently\r\nneutralized and failed to give the desired sensitivity.\r\n\r\nWith the discovery of a new, highly pure and synthetic protein by Dr.\r\nRutledge the situation with the enemy could be put on a close parallel\r\nwith the laboratory condition. The enemy could be fed the protein when\r\nthey were in need of food and had little else, but since it was\r\nsynthetic, they could not get a second supply until the Doctor was able\r\nto put the fatal meal in their way.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ April 1956 and was\r\n    first published in _Amazing Stories_ January 1930.
