He was my hero in\r\nthose days. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
I thought few wiser or greater men ever lived. In my eyes he\r\nwas greater than Babe Ruth, Lindy, or the President.\r\n\r\nOf course, time, and my growing up caused me to bring him into a\r\nperspective that I felt to be more consonant with his true position in\r\nhis field of endeavor. When he died his friends mourned for fond\r\nremembrance of things past, but privately many of them felt that he had\r\noutlived his best days. Now with this glorious vindication, I wonder how\r\nmany of them are still alive to feel the twinge of conscience....\r\n\r\nOh, we\'re delighted of course, but it seems incredible even today to us\r\nelated oldsters. Although we were always his staunchest admirers, in\r\nretrospect we can see now that no one believed more than we that he did\r\nit strictly for the dollar. It is likely there was always a small corps\r\nof starry-eyed adolescents who found the whole improbable saga entirely\r\nbelievable, or at least half believed it might be partly true. The\r\nattitude of the rest of us ranged from a patronizing disparagement that\r\nwe thought was expected of us, through grudging admiration, to\r\nout-and-out enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nCertainly if anybody had taken the trouble to consider it--and why\r\nshould they have?--the landing of the first manned ship on our satellite\r\nseemed to render him as obsolete as a horde of other lesser and even\r\ngreater lights. At any rate, it was inevitable that the conquest of the\r\nmoon would be merely a stepping-stone to more distant points.\r\n\r\nOh, no, I had nothing to do with the selection of the Red Planet. Coming\r\nin as head of Project P-4 in its latter stages, as I did when Dr.\r\nFredericks died, the selection had already been made. Yes, it\'s quite\r\nlikely I may have been plugging for Mars below the conscious level. A\r\ncombination of chance, expediency and popular demand made Mars the next\r\ntarget, rather than Venus, which was, in some ways, the more logical\r\ngoal. I would have given anything to have gone, but the metaphorical\r\nstout heart that one reporter once credited me with is not the same as\r\nan old man\'s actual fatty heart.\r\n\r\nAnd there were heartbreak years ahead before the _Goddard_ was finally\r\nready. During this time he slipped further into obscurity while big,\r\nimportant things were happening all around us. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
You\'re right, that one\r\nreally big creation of his _is_ bigger than ever. It has passed into the\r\nlanguage, and meant employment for thousands of people. Too few of them\r\nhave even heard of him. Of course, he was still known and welcomed by a\r\nsmall circle of acquaintances, but to the world at large he was truly a\r\n"forgotten man."\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of note that one of the oldest of these acquaintances was\r\npresent at blast-off time. He happened to be the grandfather of a\r\ncertain competent young crewman. The old man was a proud figure during\r\nthe brief ceremonies and his eyes filled with tears as the mighty rocket\r\nclimbed straight up on its fiery tail. He remained there gazing up at\r\nthe sky long after it had vanished.\r\n\r\nHe was heard to murmur, "I am glad the kid could go, but it is just a\r\nlark to him. He never had a \'sense of wonder.\' How could he--nobody\r\nreads anymore."\r\n\r\nAfterward, his senile emotions betraying him, he broke down completely\r\nand had to be led from the field. It is rumored he did not live long\r\nafter that.\r\n\r\nThe _Goddard_ drove on until Mars filled the viz-screen. It was planned\r\nto make at least a half-dozen braking passes around the planet for\r\nobservational purposes before the actual business of bringing the ship\r\nin for landfall began. As expected the atmosphere proved to be thin. The\r\nspeculated dead-sea areas, oddly enough, turned out to be just that. To\r\nthe surprise of some, it was soon evident that Mars possessed, or had\r\npossessed, a high civilization. The _canali_ of Schiaparelli were indeed\r\nbroad waterways stretching from pole to pole, too regular to be anything\r\nbut the work of intelligence. But most wonderful of all were the\r\nscattered, but fairly numerous large, walled cities that dotted the\r\nworld. Everybody was excited, eager to land and start exercising their\r\nspecialties.\r\n\r\nOne of the largest of these cities was selected more or less at random.\r\nIt was decided to set down just outside, yet far enough from the walls\r\nto avoid any possibility of damage from the landing jets in the event\r\nthe city was inhabited. Even if deserted, the entire scientific\r\npersonnel would have raised a howl that would have been heard back on\r\nEarth if just a section of wall was scorched. When planet-fall was\r\ncompleted and observers had time to scan the surroundings it was seen\r\nthat the city was very much alive.\r\n\r\n"What keeps them up!" marvelled Kopchainski, the aeronautics and\r\nrocketry authority.\r\n\r\nThe sky swarmed with ships of strange design. The walls were crowded\r\nwith inhabitants, too far away for detailed observation. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Even as they\r\nlooked an enormous gate opened and a procession of mounted figures\r\nemerged. In the event the place was deserted, the Captain would have had\r\nthe honor of being the first to touch Martian soil. While atmospheric\r\nand other checks were being run, he gave orders for the previously\r\ndecided alternative. Captain, semanticist and anthropologist would make\r\nthe First Contact.\r\n\r\nWith all checks agreeing that it was safe to open locks, soon the three\r\nrepresentatives of Earth were walking shoulder to shoulder down the\r\nramp. It was apparent that the two scientists purposely missed stride\r\ninches from the end, so that it was the Captain\'s foot that actually\r\ntouched ground first.\r\n\r\nThe cavalcade--though these beasties were certainly not horses--was now\r\nnear enough to the ship for details to be seen. Surprise and wonderment\r\nfilled the crew, for while the multi-legged steeds were as alien as\r\nanyone might expect to find on an alien world, the riders were very\r\ndefinitely humanoid. Briefly, brightly and barbarically trapped as they\r\nwere by earthly standards, they seemed to be little distinguishable from\r\nhomegrown homo saps.\r\n\r\nThe approaching company appeared to be armed mainly with swords and\r\nlances, but also in evidence were some tubular affairs that could very\r\nwell be some sort of projectile-discharging device. The Captain suddenly\r\nfelt unaccountably warm. It was a heavy responsibility--he hoped these\r\nMartians wouldn\'t be the type of madmen who believed in the "shoot\r\nfirst, inquire later" theory.\r\n\r\nEven as he stood there, outwardly calm but jittering internally, the\r\nMartian riders pulled up ten feet from the Earthmen. Their leader, tall,\r\ndark-haired, and subtly lighter in hue than his companions, dismounted\r\nand approached the Captain. With outstretched hand he took the Captain\'s\r\nin a firm grip.\r\n\r\nLet it be recorded here, to the shame of an Earth where reading for\r\npleasure is virtually a lost pastime, that not one man on the _Goddard_\r\nrealized the significance of what followed.\r\n\r\n"How do you do?" he said in perfect English, with an unmistakable trace\r\nof Southern accent.\r\n\r\n"Welcome to Barsoom! My name is John Carter."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ September 1957.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.
