The captain\r\nwanted to ask but something stopped him.

Behind him Doctor\r\nJohannsen sat at his desk, his gnarled old hand tight about a\r\nwhiskey bottle, the bottle the doctor always had in his desk but\r\nnever brought out except when he was alone, and waited for Captain\r\nBaird to ask his question. Captain Baird turned at last.\r\n\r\n"They are our markings?" Captain Baird asked. It was not the\r\nquestion. Captain Baird knew the markings of the Rocket Testing\r\nStation as well as the doctor did.\r\n\r\n"Yes," the doctor said, "they are our markings. Identical.

But not\r\nour paint."\r\n\r\nCaptain Baird turned back to the window. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Six months ago it had\r\nhappened. Ten minutes after launching, the giant test rocket had\r\nbeen only a speck on the observation screen. Captain Baird had\r\nturned away in disgust.\r\n\r\n"A mouse!" the captain had said, "unfortunate a mouse can\'t\r\nobserve, build, report. My men are getting restless, Johannsen."\r\n\r\n"When we are ready, Captain," the doctor had said.\r\n\r\nIt was twelve hours before the urgent call from Central Control\r\nbrought the captain running back to the laboratory. The doctor was\r\nthere before him. Professor Schultz wasted no time, he pointed to\r\nthe instrument panel. "A sudden shift, see for yourself. We\'ll\r\nmiss Mars by a million and a quarter at least."\r\n\r\nTwo hours later the shift in course of the test rocket was\r\napparent to all of them and so was their disappointment.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n"According to the instruments the steering shifted a quarter of an\r\ninch. No reason shows up," Professor Schultz said.\r\n\r\n"Flaw in the metal?" Doctor Johannsen said.\r\n\r\n"How far can it go?" Captain Baird asked.\r\n\r\nProfessor Schultz shrugged. "Until the fuel runs out, which is\r\nprobably as good as never, or until the landing mechanism is\r\nactivated by a planet-sized body."\r\n\r\n"Course? Did you plot it?" The doctor asked.\r\n\r\n"Of course I did," Professor Schultz said, "as close as I can\r\ncalculate it is headed for Alpha Centauri."\r\n\r\nCaptain Baird turned away. The doctor watched him.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you will not be quite so hasty with your men\'s lives in\r\nthe future, Captain?" the doctor said.\r\n\r\nProfessor Schultz was spinning dials. "No contact," the professor\r\nsaid, "No contact at all."\r\n\r\nThat had been six months ago. Three more test rockets had been\r\nfired successfully before the urgent report came through from\r\nAlaskan Observation Post No. 4. A rocket was coming across the\r\nPole.\r\n\r\nThe strange rocket was tracked and escorted by atomic armed\r\nfighters all the way to the Rocket Testing Station where it cut\r\nits own motors and gently landed. In the center of a division of\r\natomic-armed infantry the captain, the doctor, and everyone else,\r\nwaited impatiently. There was an air of uneasiness.\r\n\r\n"You\'re sure it\'s not ours?" Captain Baird asked.\r\n\r\nThe doctor laughed. "Identical, yes, but three times the size of\r\nours."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps one of the Asian ones?"\r\n\r\n"No, it\'s our design, but too large, much too large."\r\n\r\nProfessor Schultz put their thoughts into words. "Looks like\r\nsomeone copied ours. Someone, somewhere.

It\'s hard to imagine, but\r\ntrue nevertheless."\r\n\r\nThey waited two weeks. Nothing happened. Then a radiation-shielded\r\nteam went in to examine the rocket. Two more weeks and the strange\r\nrocket was dismantled and spread over the field of the testing\r\nstation. The rocket was dismantled and the station had begun to\r\ntalk to itself in whispers and look at the sky.\r\n\r\nCaptain Baird stood now at the window and looked out at the\r\ndismantled rocket. He looked but his mind was not on the parts of\r\nthe rocket he could see from the window.\r\n\r\n"The materials, they\'re not ours?" the captain asked.\r\n\r\n"Unknown here," the doctor said.\r\n\r\nThe captain nodded. "Those were our instruments?"\r\n\r\n"Yes." The doctor still held the whiskey bottle in a tight grip.\r\n\r\n"They sent them back," the captain said.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe doctor crashed the bottle hard against the desk top. "Ask it,\r\nCaptain, for God\'s sake!!"\r\n\r\nThe captain turned to face the doctor directly. "It was a man, a\r\nfull grown man."\r\n\r\nThe doctor sighed as if letting the pent-up steam of his heart\r\nescape. "Yes, it is a man. It breathes, it eats, it has all the\r\nattributes of a man. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
But it is not of our planet."\r\n\r\n"Its speech ..." the captain began.\r\n\r\n"That isn\'t speech, Captain," the doctor broke in, breaking in\r\nsharply, "It\'s only sound." The doctor stopped; he examined the\r\nlabel of his bottle of whiskey very carefully. A good brand of\r\nwhiskey. "He seems quite happy in the storeroom. You know,\r\nCaptain, what puzzled me at first? He can\'t read. He can\'t read\r\nanything, not even the instruments in that ship. In fact he shows\r\nno interest in his rocket at all."\r\n\r\nThe captain sat down now. He sat at the desk and faced the doctor.\r\n"At least _they_ had the courage to send a man, not a mouse.\r\nDoctor, a man."\r\n\r\nThe doctor stared at the captain, his hand squeezing and\r\nunsqueezing on the whiskey bottle. "A man who can\'t read his own\r\ninstruments?" The doctor laughed. "Perhaps you too have failed to\r\nsee the point? Like that stupid general who sits out there waiting\r\nfor the men from somewhere to invade?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think it\'s a possibility?"\r\n\r\nThe doctor nodded. "A very good possibility, Captain, but they\r\nwill not be men." The doctor seemed to pause and lean forward.\r\n"That rocket, Captain, is a test rocket. A test rocket _just like\r\nours_!"\r\n\r\nThen the doctor picked up his whiskey bottle at last and poured\r\ntwo glasses.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps a drink, Captain?"\r\n\r\nThe captain was watching the sky outside the window.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
