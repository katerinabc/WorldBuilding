]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hatch to the front compartment swung open for the first time. One\r\nman came out. He turned at once to make sure that the air-tight door\r\nbehind him had locked. Satisfied that it had, he turned again to look\r\ndown the cabin at us. His face showed that insolence we\'d learned to\r\nknow as the uniform of the "Bupo", the State Secret Police.\r\n\r\nThe man from Bupo walked down the aisle between the passengers\r\ntoward the rear of the car. He swept his eyes right and left like a\r\nsuspecting-machine, catching every detail of us on his memory. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
People\r\nleaned toward the walls as he approached, like children shrinking back\r\nfrom a big animal, and relaxed as he went by. He was out of sight in\r\nthe galley at the rear for a moment, then was back, carrying a pitcher\r\nof water in one hand and the key to the front compartment in the other.\r\n\r\nA battering-ram hammered into my belly. I slammed bent, hitting my\r\nhead against the knees of the man sitting across from me. The capsule\r\nshuddered, smearing some obstruction against its outer wall. There\r\nwas an instant when I weighed nothing. Then my head snapped back with\r\nhangman\'s violence as the capsule bounced forward a few meters. Then we\r\nwere still. From the shock to the silence was a matter of ten seconds.\r\n\r\nI pulled myself up from the floor. Surprisingly, my skeleton still\r\nhinged at the joints and nowhere else. The Bupo man was flat in the\r\naisle, bleeding black splotches into the green carpet. He still had\r\nhold of a piece of the water-pitcher\'s handle. I ignored him, while my\r\nbrain began to push out explanations for this impossible accident.\r\n\r\nSomething had gotten into the Tube, that slick intestine we\'d ridden\r\nthrough under the Andes, below the Matto Grosso, out under the pampas.\r\nSomething had got in the way of the hundred hurricanes that pushed us.\r\nThe eyes and ears and un-man-like senses I\'d helped build into this\r\nfive thousand kilometers of metal gut had stopped the pumps. The vacuum\r\ninviting our capsule on had filled with air, no longer tugging us to\r\nthe terminal nest by the Atlantic. We were abandoned, fifteen meters\r\nunder God-knows-where.\r\n\r\nMrs. Swaime, who knew that I\'d helped in the Tube\'s engineering, turned\r\nto me for explanation. "What happened?" 

=== Chunk 4 ===
she asked. "What did we hit?"\r\n\r\nThe foreigner across the aisle, Mr. Rhinklav\'n, smiled, a curious\r\neffect. "A cow on the track, I believe," he said, his voice brassy with\r\nthe accent of Mars.\r\n\r\n"How did a cow get in here?" Anna demanded. She was the girl whose\r\ngirl-ness had snagged the eyes and riled the hormones of every male in\r\nthe car.\r\n\r\n"The gentleman is joking," I assured Anna. I glanced toward\r\nSurgeon-General Raimazan, the man whose knees had hammered my forehead.\r\nHe was clutching his right forearm, his eyes squeezed shut by pain.\r\n"What happened, Doctor?" I demanded, laying my hand on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n"Fractured my arm, my ulna. Get my case under the seat. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
I want to look\r\nat him." The doctor nodded toward the Bupo man, who was struggling to\r\nsit up. I got out the doctor\'s bag.\r\n\r\n"Morphine?" I asked, finding it.\r\n\r\n"Codeine, next tray, will be plenty." I dropped three of the pills\r\ninto Dr. Raimazan\'s left hand. He swallowed them without water. I\r\nused my newspaper for a splint, rolling it tight and bandaging it to\r\nthe doctor\'s forearm. Then I hammocked the arm in a sling made of a\r\ntriangular bandage. "OK?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"You could make a fortune in orthopedics," Dr. Raimazan said. "Let\'s\r\nget our friend out of the aisle." I stepped out and pulled the\r\npoliceman toward a sitting position. He groaned and opened his eyes.\r\nThough he\'d fallen into the fragments of the broken pitcher, he\'d\r\nsuffered damage only to his dignity and his lower lip. A line of red\r\ndashes below the lip showed where his teeth had bitten through. He\r\nshook his head at our offers of tape and antiseptic and struggled to\r\nhis feet. Holding the key to the front compartment before him like a\r\ndagger, he shuffled up there. He unlocked the door. Shouting something\r\nviolent, he ducked into the compartment and slammed the door behind him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI lent my hands to the Surgeon-General\'s instructions, patching up the\r\ncuts and sprains the passengers had gotten. In a moment Miss Barrie,\r\nthe stewardess, took the bandages out of my hands and finished the job\r\nwith fewer knots and less adhesive. The passengers sat quiet in the dim\r\nlight of the capsule, as though afraid that panic might constitute\r\na security-violation. The lovely Anna pouted. Though she was unhurt\r\nherself, her precious radio was shattered. It lay under her seat,\r\nits antenna snapped like a slender idiot\'s-neck, its electronic guts\r\nspilling from its belly.\r\n\r\n"Whatever else happens, we\'re rid of that puling nuisance," Don Raffe\r\ngrowled, looking at the ex-radio. His mouth settled into creases,\r\na satisfied line between parentheses. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
He picked up his magazine\r\nand leafed through it, to prove himself superior to these chance\r\njoltings-about. The lights maliciously dropped till only the bulbs at\r\neither end of the aisle were glowing. These died till they were yellow\r\ncoils, magnifying the dark that fogged us.\r\n\r\nIn the top tray of my test kit was a flashlight. I broke it out to\r\nsweep the light in a quick survey of the car. Anna\'s eyes squinted at\r\nmy beam, her mouth loose with fear for a moment, like a drawstring\r\nbag. Then she squared off, sat straight, stared defiantly into my\r\nlight. Without looking down she snapped her purse open and took a tiny\r\nautomatic pistol from it. She laid this on the seat beside her, out\r\nof sight. "I\'ve got a right to defend myself," Anna said, grim as a\r\nsuffragette. I laughed out loud at this tableau of maidenhood-at-bay.\r\nShe smoothed her hair back with both hands, making a double cantilever\r\nof her arms to lift her breasts, demonstrating the noble architecture\r\nof woman, mocking me. I stopped laughing. I jumped the beam over her to\r\nhelp Miss Barrie break out the emergency lights.\r\n\r\nThose lamps were lit, and glowed in the cabin with their chilly blue\r\nlight. Mrs. Swaime asked of the woman beside her, as though it were an\r\nafterthought, "Why did we stop?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," Mrs. Grimm admitted. I knew her. She was the wife of\r\nthe Minister of Agriculture, a man who\'d acquired a reputation for\r\nintegrity in a government that didn\'t use the word. "For me the Tube\r\nhas always been just a link between home and Albert\'s office at Bahia.\r\nI didn\'t think that link could break."\r\n\r\nMiss Barrie was knocking at the door up front. It opened a reluctant\r\ninch to show the eye of the Bupo cop. He growled some answer to the\r\nstewardess\' question, then slammed and relocked his door. Miss Barrie\r\nhurried back to me. "A man was pulled out of that compartment," she\r\nsaid. "He unlocked the entry hatch and was blown out into the Tube by\r\ncabin pressure."\r\n\r\n"Like a beetle blasted off a bush by a garden hose," Don Raffe murmured.\r\n\r\n"I expect my baggage is strung out from here to Havana," Anna pouted.\r\n"Doesn\'t the State have regulations to keep prisoners from killing\r\nthemselves on public property?"\r\n\r\n"Suicide?" Mrs. Swaime asked, soft as a prayer.\r\n\r\n"Must have been," Don Raffe snapped. He twisted his magazine into a\r\nclub, underlining his words with thumps against his open palm. "Some\r\nweakling not worthy to stand with us in war, he was. A conscientious\r\nobjector, probably." Don Raffe said "conscientious objector" exactly\r\nas he\'d have said the name of a sexual perversion. "We\'re all going to\r\nthe Capital on the Leader\'s business. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Some of us have been called to\r\nthe Leader\'s actual presence." He glowed pride, giving his secret away.\r\n"There is no place in the Leader\'s new society for weaklings. They are\r\nbetter where this one is, underground, dead."\r\n\r\n"Many of us are pained by the thought of war," the Martian said. "Not\r\nin the pain of weakness, but that of pity for men lost in battle who\r\nmight have grown strong in peace."\r\n\r\n"A peace-monger!" Don Raffe\'s was the tone of a Puritan finding a red\r\nzuchetto under his pastor\'s hat. "Surely you don\'t expect our Leader\r\nto bear forever the insults of the Yellow Confederacy? Of course," Don\r\nRaffe\'s eyes widened in anticipation of delicious violence, "you men\r\nfrom Mars are yellow, too." The foreigner, whose skin was in fact the\r\ncolor of lemon-peel, smiled and made no comment.\r\n\r\n"I wish you men wouldn\'t talk so much about war," Mrs. Swaime broke in.\r\n"Talking about ugly things just helps them to happen. Rafiel, my boy,\r\nis in the Continental Guard. He says we\'ll have no war. He says that\r\nthe Confederacy is too afraid of our airpower to risk a war. Rafiel is\r\na flier."\r\n\r\n"Of course," Don Raffe smiled, his smile not reaching up to his eyes.\r\n"The Yellow Confederacy is so afraid of our flying defenders that\r\nwe\'re forced to travel like moles, so as not to confuse our own radar\r\nguns. Our skies are closed to us. Everything that flies across two\r\ncontinents, from Tierra del Fuego to Medicine Hat, is shot from the air\r\nas an enemy. We must take to these caves for a ten-hour trip. Ten hours\r\nfor a capsule to be blown from Bogota to the coast, a trip a rocket\r\ncould clip off in minutes! That\'s why our leader will take us to war,\r\nto get back the freedom of our own blue skies." Don Raffe finished, a\r\nlittle breathless.\r\n\r\n"I wonder who the poor man was," Mrs. Swaime said, ignoring him.\r\n\r\nMiss Barrie shook her head, wondering the same thing. Without saying\r\nanything, she went back to the galley to call a surface station on the\r\ncapsule\'s radio-telephone. While she was back there, Miss Barrie took\r\na lamp and peered through the glass window in the rear hatch. She saw\r\nwhat becomes of a man caught between a pistoning capsule and its tube.\r\nAfter being sick, she came to tell us that the surface station had\r\ndetermined that we were just east of the village of Rabanan. My mental\r\nmap of the route the Tube followed showed Rabanan as a dot fifteen\r\nkilometers from the nearest exit hatch. Miss Barrie smiled on courage.\r\n"A rescue party will be here before long," she assured the others.\r\n"Would anyone care for sandwiches or coffee while we wait?" Her stomach\r\nmust have cringed at the thought.\r\n\r\n"Tea would be nice," Mr. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
Rhinklav\'n volunteered. Then he realized\r\nhis blunder: tea came from Confederacy countries. "I mean coffee, of\r\ncourse!" he said.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll help you get it ready," Mrs. Grimm said to Miss Barrie.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," the hostess protested, without much conviction in her voice.\r\nMrs. Grimm smiled and led the way back to the galley. In a moment she\r\nhad the water for our coffee steaming on the chemical burner. The\r\nstewardess meanwhile was smearing the current butter-substitute on\r\nslivers of bread and arranging the buttered triangles into Maltese\r\ncrosses on our plates. Thus Miss Barrie brought us tiffin.\r\n\r\nThe Martian took his coffee black. He sat looking into it as he sipped,\r\nas though apologizing for his alien presence. Mrs. Swaime, more\r\npracticed than the rest of us in this act of informal refection, took a\r\nslice of bread and a cup of sugar-thick coffee and talked. She steered\r\nclear of the grim topics around us, turning her attention instead to\r\nMr. Rhinklav\'n, who sparkled back at her like a grateful mirror. "Is\r\nthis your first visit to Earth?" she asked him.\r\n\r\n"No, indeed. I spent several years at your excellent University at Sao\r\nPaulo," the yellow man said. "That was some time ago, of course." 

=== Chunk 9 ===
He\r\nrefrained from saying just how long ago. The Martian lifespan makes\r\nhumanity\'s scant three-score and ten look feeble.\r\n\r\nThe Surgeon-General asked me quietly, "Why, exactly, are we held here?"\r\n\r\n"As long as the body is back there the pumps can\'t run. Safety devices\r\nprevent the capsule from moving so long as there\'s a foreign body in\r\nthe Tube." I stopped, suddenly aware of my clumsy, accidental pun.\r\n\r\n"All right," Dr. Raimazan said. "We\'ll have to move the corpse into the\r\ncapsule, and take it to Bahia with us."\r\n\r\n"It will be the worst sort of job," I said.\r\n\r\n"If the repair crew takes more than a day, we\'re in for trouble\r\nanyway." He was right. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
This was February, our hottest month. "You have\r\na strong stomach?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"No." I hurried forward to tell Miss Barrie of our decision. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
She gave\r\nus a lamp and a blanket, and phoned the surface to tell them what we\r\nwere doing. The doctor and I locked the air-tight door of the galley\r\nbehind us.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt this end of the capsule there was a second air-tight hatch, exactly\r\nlike that in front, the one the body had hurtled through. At its\r\nmiddle, like a glass navel, was a dial showing the pressure outside. It\r\nread 975 millibars. I spun the wheel to unlock the door from its frame,\r\nstubbornly resisting the temptation to anticipate through the window,\r\nto see what waited us out there. The hatch swung out.\r\n\r\nI turned the lamplight on the walls outside. It was bad. The tube was\r\nbulged at the top a little way back, like a vein about to rupture.\r\nIts surface was smeared with red. It smelled like a place where they\r\nslaughter chickens. The body lay about twenty meters back. I took the\r\nblanket from Dr. Raimazan and walked back along the slippery shaft,\r\ntrying to dull my eyes and nose to what I was about to do. The doctor,\r\none arm trussed to his chest by my crude sling, could lend me only\r\nmoral support. I looked down at the corpse. One arm had been torn off\r\nat the shoulder, and was held to the body by the handcuffs between the\r\nwrists. The man had been cut and burned and broken before he\'d thrown\r\nhimself out of the capsule.\r\n\r\nI rolled the thing into the blanket and dragged it behind me to the\r\ncapsule. It took ten minutes for me to force it through the hatch.\r\nInside, we rolled the body under the galley sink, then washed our shoes\r\nand ourselves. We dogged the hatch shut and phoned topside, telling\r\nthem to let the winds take hold again.\r\n\r\nAs we made ready to go back into the cabin, the light of my lamp\r\nglinted off a bit of metal lying on the floor. It had fallen from our\r\nhorrible package under the sink. Dr. Raimazan picked it up. He held it\r\nnear the lamp, examining it. He was going to say something to me when\r\nthe door to the cabin, which we\'d unlocked, burst open. 

=== Chunk 12 ===
"What in hell\'s\r\nname are you doing?" the Bupo man demanded.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve cleared the Tube," I said very softly, shoving before his face\r\nthe card that showed with my face and fingerprints that I was a Tube\r\nEngineer. The Surgeon-General stared at the policeman as though he were\r\nsomething wet and stinking from a swamp.\r\n\r\n"Who was the man who jumped from your compartment?" the doctor asked.\r\n\r\n"State business!" the Bupo snapped. "Keep your mouth shut!" Too late,\r\nhe recognized the Surgeon-General\'s uniform, and became silent.\r\n\r\n"Watch your long tongue," Dr. Raimazan growled. "I have an audience\r\nwith the Leader: you may find yourself envying the poor devil under\r\nthe sink his blanket." The Bupo, wavering between anger and apology,\r\nsettled on an attitude of injured dignity. He turned and stalked down\r\nthe aisle toward his private cabin up front. I followed him with my\r\neyes, memorizing him. In case I should ever meet him again, I wanted to\r\ncomplete wrecking his face where the accident had left off.\r\n\r\nThe capsule jumped onto its plunger of wind. Only the brilliance of the\r\nceiling lights showed that we were again flashing toward the coast and\r\nthe Capital. I sat beside the Surgeon-General. "What was it that you\r\npicked up back there?" I asked him. He handed me the thing. It was a\r\nMedal of Honor. Its ribbon was a scrap of silk, and the medal itself\r\nwas bent as though it had been clamped in a vise and hammered. Turning\r\nit over, I read the engraved legend through a smear of blood. "To\r\nDoctor Noah Raimazan, for devotion to his profession, his people, and\r\nhis Leader." A curt congratulation, I thought. After a moment I asked,\r\n"A brother?"\r\n\r\n"My oldest son. He saved hundreds in the ruins of Managua, in the\r\nplague that followed the Revolution there." Dr. Raimazan took the medal\r\nfrom me and sat rocking back and forth, staring at the laurel-garnished\r\nstar in his hand. "Why did they kill him?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"It wasn\'t suicide?"\r\n\r\n"It was escape. You saw what they\'d done to him, with their little\r\nknives, their pliers and electrodes. Noah was a hero, set by Imperial\r\norder on a pedestal. He looked directly at the Leader, man to man, his\r\nphysician. He wasn\'t as strong as I am, this son of mine. Noah couldn\'t\r\nwatch men killed for their ideas, defending his silence with the\r\nargument that he was a doctor, set somewhere above grubby politics."\r\nDr. Raimazan\'s voice was loud enough that anyone in the car who wished\r\ncould have heard him.\r\n\r\n"Your son died for talking plain," I whispered to the doctor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe sat in silence. The Capital of the Leader of our hemisphere was\r\nonly an hour away. 

=== Chunk 13 ===
After a moment the Surgeon-General sat straight. He\r\nbrushed his uniform with his left hand, and smoothed the sling under\r\nhis right arm. Then he crossed the aisle to the seat where Anna sat. I\r\nstared at him. "Do you mind if I sit beside you?" he smiled down at the\r\ngirl, as gallant as though they were at a military ball.\r\n\r\n"As you wish, General," Anna answered. She was pleased, I saw, that a\r\nman with such a uniform and such position should notice her.\r\n\r\nThe doctor talked to Anna the way a pretty girl expects to be talked\r\nto, emphasizing what he was saying by an occasional avuncular pat.\r\nAfter a while, Anna grew a little bored with a playmate who was older\r\nthan her father. As the car began to slow, caught by resistance coils\r\nin the walls of the Tube, I saw the Surgeon-General pat the girl\r\nplayfully once more, and pick up something she\'d laid beside her in the\r\ndarkness. She didn\'t notice.\r\n\r\nWe halted on the shores of the Bay of All Saints, Bahia, the Capital.\r\nWe saw no more of the Bupo man, since his compartment held the exit\r\nhatch. He was out first, scurrying somewhere with the news of Noah\r\nRaimazan\'s suicide, news which would either lift him a notch in his\r\nprofession or push his head onto the chopping-block. The rest of us\r\nlined up, passed through the front compartment, out onto the platform.\r\nThe station sparkled like a diamond tiara, glittering with slogans and\r\nbrass and reminders that we\'d reached the greatest city in our half of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nA gray sedan stood on the ramp, waiting for those the Leader had\r\nsingled out for audience. Its door bore those interlocked commas, the\r\nyin-yang symbol that the Leader had taken from the enemy to make his\r\ncypher. Dr. Raimazan nodded good-bye to me. Accompanied by Don Raffe,\r\nhe walked over to the Imperial limousine. The Surgeon-General replied\r\nto the salutes of the bodyguards with his left hand, turning aside\r\ntheir references to his injury with a grin. The doors slammed shut, and\r\nthe sedan roared off, carrying Don Raffe and Surgeon-General Raimazan\r\nto meet the Leader.\r\n\r\nAnd carrying, under the doctor\'s sling, the little pistol I\'d seen him\r\nsteal from Anna.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
