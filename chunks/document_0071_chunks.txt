And with good reason. Here was a man who\'d\r\nspent his life in a machine shop coming down one morning to say in all\r\napparent sincerity, "I\'ve decided to be a concert pianist."\r\n\r\nJan Grabowski, on the turret lathe grinned and said, "Sure, John.\r\nThey\'ll bring in a grand piano and you can practice between cuts."\r\n\r\n"They laughed when I sat down to the piano," someone bellowed and there\r\nwas general laughter and the thing was forgotten.\r\n\r\nBut later, when he told the boss he was quitting, they looked at each\r\nother in amazement. He\'d evidently gone mad and that was no laughing\r\nmatter because they liked John.\r\n\r\nSam Paine, harassed plant manager still found time to be human. When he\r\ndiscovered John was serious, he sat down and gave him half an hour,\r\nfiguring he could find the quirk and straighten the man out. As they\r\nwent to his office, he swiftly classified his employee: John Harper--33\r\nyears old--introverted--intelligent over and above his job. Harper\r\nseemed to be without ambition, though and Sam wondered about this but\r\nhad never had time to talk with him much.\r\n\r\nAfter the half hour was up, Paine sighed and let him go. Obviously the\r\nconcert pianist gag was a coverup for something else--some fancied\r\nwrong--perhaps plain restlessness.\r\n\r\nAlone, Paine went back over the conversation, intrigued by John\r\nHarper\'s strange determination.\r\n\r\n"This talk about being a concert pianist is a gag of course, isn\'t it,\r\nJohn?"\r\n\r\n"No, Mr.

Paine."\r\n\r\n"But man--you\'re too old to start a thing like that. You never in your\r\nlife studied music did you?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir."\r\n\r\n"Then let me tell you--first, in a thing like that, you\'ve got to have\r\ntalent. Have you got talent?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know."\r\n\r\nIt had seemed ridiculous, seriously pinpointing things that should have\r\nbeen obvious. "Well let\'s say you have--just for argument\'s sake. All\r\nright--talent has to be caught early and nourished--like a seed--get\r\nwhat I mean? A man can\'t start at your age and get any place in a game\r\nthe experts started in at eight or nine--as children."\r\n\r\n"You may be right, Mr.

Paine, but maybe that doesn\'t apply to me. Maybe\r\nit does, of course, but I\'ve got to find out."\r\n\r\nSam Paine gave up. He told John Harper his job would be waiting when\r\nhe wanted it again--even gave him an extra week\'s pay, but that was to\r\nsalve his conscience because he felt he should bring in a psychiatrist\r\nat company expense to see what had gone wrong with Harper. Then he\r\nshrugged and put the thing out of his mind. Funny things happen in this\r\nday and age, he thought.\r\n\r\nThe trouble was he didn\'t really know John Harper. No one did. A\r\nbachelor, Harper lived alone, thought alone--and suffered alone. He\r\nhated the futility of his life, the work he was doing, the passing of\r\nunfulfilled days and nights. He felt a strong pull of destiny he could\r\nneither explain nor deny; an unreasoning certainty that he, John Harper\r\nwas meant for better things; or perhaps a single better thing.\r\n\r\nHe lived with this certainty while the unfulfilled days and nights\r\npiled up. Until the misery became a pain and possibly demanded some\r\nsort of recognition by its very existence.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, the morning of the day he quit his job, he had just\r\nawakened to the old familiar dread of the day ahead; a dread almost\r\nakin to a physical sickness. He was sure he did not go back to sleep,\r\nbut he clearly saw, on the floor within range of his eyes, a television\r\nset. The picture was bright and clear--a famous newscaster with the\r\nsmile known from coast to coast and the rat-tat-tat voice that was his\r\ntrademark.\r\n\r\nHe was beginning his broadcast with the standard opening line: "_And\r\nnow, folks--what\'s been going on in the world? John Harper, the great\r\nconcert pianist--the man who brought long-hair music into the home--the\r\nman loved by millions, will--_"\r\n\r\nThe voice and the image vanished. Then the set faded, and John Harper\r\nlay tense in the bed in his shoddy little room.

But a different John\r\nHarper now. In an instant he became a dedicated man knowing he had been\r\nbuilding up to this moment for years.\r\n\r\nThis was the incident Sam Paine did not know of; nor did anyone except\r\nJohn Harper himself. He had a little money saved up--a few hundred\r\ndollars--and he went straight to a music school. His difficulty was\r\nthat he could not camouflage his ambition--or rather his intent--and\r\nafter stating exactly what he proposed to do, he was turned down by\r\nfive reputable maestros in a row.\r\n\r\nSo he gave up seeking instruction and rented a piano. He was\r\nfortunately situated in that his room lay at the back of the resident\r\nhotel where he lived and the walls were as thick as the building was\r\nold and shoddy looking.\r\n\r\nHe bought some instruction books at a second hand store and went to\r\nwork. He practiced, plowing doggedly through the intricacies of the\r\nnotes and scales until his money ran out. Then he got a job washing\r\ndishes and practiced all night.\r\n\r\nUntil he was able to present himself again at a music school where the\r\nmaestro was, fortunately, both honest and possessed of a conscience.\r\nHis honesty said, send this man away. But John Harper had just enough\r\npathetic skill and foggy talent that the instructor\'s conscience\r\ndictated the final policy.\r\n\r\n"I will teach you," he said. Adding to himself, _It will be an act of\r\ncharity. Nothing more._ He would have been astounded, however, had he\r\nknown that four short months before John Harper had not known even the\r\nscale.\r\n\r\nJohn told no one this. He told no one anything. But he applied himself\r\nto the piano with a single-mindedness that made a fanatic seem\r\nchangeable as the wind by comparison.\r\n\r\nAnd soon, Professor Heinrich, he of the conscience, was confronted with\r\nsomething he could not understand. Genius was blooming and functioning\r\nbefore his eyes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe rest is history. It is told in hushed tones how this sad-faced,\r\nmiddle-aged man with no background--he was called "The Man From\r\nNowhere," by certain romantically inclined critics--gave his first\r\nrecital in New York City. It was given exactly seven years from the day\r\nhe told Sam Paine, "I\'m quitting to become a concert pianist."\r\n\r\nThe television networks found him quickly and he rocketed to fame by\r\ngiving classical music an interpretation that made it understood and\r\nloved by millions.\r\n\r\nIt was said that John Harper gave more musical pleasure to the world in\r\nhis brief two-year career than had any other genius in a natural span.\r\n\r\nBut of course, the seven years had taken their toll. The punishment of\r\nlearning would have killed a far younger and stronger man than John\r\nHarper. So, after a tragically brief time at the top of his ladder,\r\nJohn Harper was the subject of a newscast.\r\n\r\nBy a famous newscaster with the smile famous from coast-to-coast and a\r\nrat-tat-tat voice that was his trademark.\r\n\r\nBut not smiling as he finished his first item. "_--be buried tomorrow\r\nin New York City._"\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
