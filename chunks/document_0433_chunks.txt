The\r\n    intricacies in radio are so great, and the changes occur so quickly\r\n    that no one can afford to make a will wherein a radio provision\r\n    figures. Once we thought of having a radio loud speaker installed in\r\n    our coffin to keep us company and make it less lonesome. After\r\n    reading this story we quickly changed our mind. The possibilities\r\n    are too various._\r\n\r\n\r\nI first met Mr. Remington Solander shortly after I installed my first\r\nradio set. I was going in to New York on the 8:15 A.M. train and was\r\nsitting with my friend Murchison and, as a matter of course, we were\r\ntalking radio. I had just told Murchison that he was a lunkheaded noodle\r\nand that for two cents I would poke him in the jaw, and that even a\r\npin-headed idiot ought to know that a tube set was better than a crystal\r\nset. To this Murchison had replied that that settled it. He said he had\r\nalways known I was a moron, and now he was sure of it.\r\n\r\n"If you had enough brains to fill a hazelnut shell," he said, "you\r\nwouldn\'t talk that way. Anybody but a half-baked lunatic would know that\r\nwhat a man wants in radio is clear, sharp reception and that\'s what a\r\ncrystal gives you. You\'re one of these half-wits that think they\'re\r\nclassy if they can hear some two-cent station five hundred miles away\r\nutter a few faint squeaks. Shut up! I don\'t want to talk to you. I don\'t\r\nwant to listen to you. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
Go and sit somewhere else."\r\n\r\nOf course, this was what was to be expected of Murchison. And if I did\r\nlet out a few laps of anger, I feel I was entirely justified. Radio fans\r\nare always disputing over the relative merits of crystal and tube sets,\r\nbut I knew I was right. I was just trying to decide whether to choke\r\nMurchison with my bare hand and throw his lifeless body out of the car\r\nwindow, or tell him a few things I had been wanting to say ever since he\r\nbegan knocking my tube set, when this Remington Solander, who was\r\nsitting behind us, leaned forward and tapped me on the shoulder. I\r\nturned quickly and saw his long sheeplike face close to mine. He was\r\nchewing cardamon seed and breathing the odor into my face.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Outraged citizens were removing their dead.]\r\n\r\n"My friend," he said, "come back and sit with me; I want to ask you a\r\nfew questions about radio."\r\n\r\nWell, I couldn\'t resist that, could I? No radio fan could. I did not\r\ncare much for the looks of this Remington Solander man, but for a few\r\nweeks my friends had seemed to be steering away from me when I drew\r\nnear, although I am sure I never said anything to bore them. All I ever\r\ntalked about was my radio set and some new hook-ups I was trying, but I\r\nhad noticed that men who formerly had seemed to be fond of my company\r\nnow gave startled looks when I neared them. Some even climbed over the\r\nnearest fence and ran madly across vacant lots, looking over their\r\nshoulders with frightened glances as they ran. For a week I had not been\r\nable to get any man of my acquaintance to listen to one word from me,\r\nexcept Murchison, and he is an utter idiot, as I think I have made\r\nclear. So I left Murchison and sat with Remington Solander.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn one way I was proud to be invited to sit with Remington Solander,\r\nbecause he was far and away the richest man in our town. When he died,\r\nhis estate proved to amount to three million dollars. I had seen him\r\noften, and I knew who he was, but he was a stand-offish old fellow and\r\ndid not mix, so I had never met him. He was a tall man and thin,\r\nsomewhat flabby and he was pale in an unhealthy sort of way. But, after\r\nall, he was a millionaire and a member of one of the "old families" of\r\nWestcote, so I took the seat alongside of him with considerable\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n"I gather," he said as soon as I was seated, "that you are interested in\r\nradio."\r\n\r\nI told him I was.\r\n\r\n"And I\'m just building a new set, using a new hook-up that I heard of a\r\nweek ago," I said. "I think it is going to be a wonder. Now, here is the\r\nidea: instead of using a grid----"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes!" the old aristocrat said hastily. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
"But never mind that now. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
I\r\nknow very little of such things. I have an electrician employed by the\r\nyear to care for my radio set and I leave all such things to him. You\r\nare a lawyer, are you not?"\r\n\r\nI told him I was.\r\n\r\n"And you are chairman of the trustees of the Westcote Cemetery, are you\r\nnot?" he asked.\r\n\r\nI told him I was that also. And I may say that the Westcote Cemetery\r\nAssociation is one of the rightest and tightest little corporations in\r\nexistence. It has been in existence since 1808 and has been exceedingly\r\nprofitable to those fortunate enough to hold its stock. I inherited the\r\nsmall block I own from my grandfather. Recently we trustees had bought\r\nsixty additional acres adjoining the old cemetery and had added them to\r\nit, and we were about ready to put the new lots on the market. At $300\r\napiece there promised to be a tremendous profit in the thing, for our\r\ncemetery was a fashionable place to be buried in and the demand for the\r\nlots in the new addition promised to be enormous.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"You have not known it," said Remington Solander in his slow drawl,\r\nwhich had the effect of letting his words slide out of his mouth and\r\ndrip down his long chin like cold molasses, "but I have been making\r\ninquiries about you, and I have been meaning to speak to you. I am\r\ndrawing up a new last will and testament, and I want you to draw up one\r\nof the clauses for me without delay."\r\n\r\n"Why, certainly, Mr. Solander," I said with increased pride. "I\'ll be\r\nglad to be of service to you."\r\n\r\n"I am choosing you for the work," Remington Solander said, "because you\r\nknow and love radio as I do, and because you are a trustee of the\r\ncemetery association. Are you a religious man?

=== Chunk 5 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Well," I said, a little uneasily, "some. Some, but not much."\r\n\r\n"No matter," said Mr. Solander, placing a hand on my arm. "I am. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
I have\r\nalways been. From my earliest youth my mind has been on serious things.\r\nAs a matter of fact, sir, I have compiled a manuscript collection of\r\nreligious quotations, hymns, sermons and uplifting thoughts which now\r\nfill fourteen volumes, all in my own handwriting. Fortunately, I\r\ninherited money, and this collection is my gift to the world."\r\n\r\n"And a noble one, I\'m sure," I said.\r\n\r\n"Most noble," said Mr. Solander. "But, sir, I have not confined my\r\nactivities to the study chair. I have kept my eye on the progress of the\r\nworld. And it seems to me that radio, this new and wonderful invention,\r\nis the greatest discovery of all ages and imperishable. But, sir, it is\r\nbeing twisted to cheap uses. Jazz! Cheap songs! Worldly words and music!\r\nThat I mean to remedy."\r\n\r\n"Well," I said, "it might be done. Of course, people like what they\r\nlike."\r\n\r\n"Some nobler souls like better things," said Remington Solander\r\nsolemnly. "Some more worthy men and women will welcome nobler radio\r\nbroadcasting. In my will I am putting aside one million dollars to\r\nestablish and maintain a broadcasting station that will broadcast only\r\nmy fourteen volumes of hymns and uplifting material. Every day this\r\nmatter will go forth--sermons, lectures on prohibition, noble thoughts\r\nand religious poems."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI assured him that some people might be glad to get that--that a lot of\r\npeople might, in fact, and that I could write that into his will without\r\nany trouble at all.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said Remington Solander. "But that is already in my will. What I\r\nwant you to write for my will, is another clause. I mean to build, in\r\nyour cemetery, a high-class and imperishable granite tomb for myself. I\r\nmean to place it on that knoll--that high knoll--the highest spot in\r\nyour cemetery. What I want you to write into my will is a clause\r\nproviding for the perpetual care and maintenance of my tomb. I want to\r\nset aside five hundred thousand dollars for that purpose."\r\n\r\n"Well," I said to the sheep-faced millionaire, "I can do that, too."\r\n\r\n"Yes," he agreed. "And I want to give my family and relations the\r\nremaining million and a half dollars, provided," he said, accenting the\r\n\'provided,\' "they carry out faithfully the provisions of the clause\r\nproviding for the perpetual care and maintenance of my tomb. If they\r\ndon\'t care and maintain," he said, giving me a hard look, "that million\r\nand a half is to go to the Home for Flea-Bitten Dogs."\r\n\r\n"They\'ll care and maintain, all right!" I laughed.\r\n\r\n"I think so," said Remington Solander gravely. "I do think so, indeed!\r\nAnd now, sir, we come to the important part. You, as I know, are a\r\ntrustee of the cemetery.

=== Chunk 7 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Yes," I said, "I am."\r\n\r\n"For drawing this clause of my will, if you can draw it," said Remington\r\nSolander, looking me full in the eye with both his own, which were like\r\nthe eyes of a salt mackerel, "I shall pay you five thousand dollars."\r\n\r\nWell, I almost gasped. It was a big lot of money for drawing one clause\r\nof a will, and I began to smell a rat right there. But, I may say, the\r\nproposition Remington Solander made to me was one I was able, after\r\nquite a little talk with my fellow trustees of the cemetery, to carry\r\nout. What Remington Solander wanted was to be permitted to put a radio\r\nloud-speaking outfit in his granite tomb--a radio loud-speaking outfit\r\npermanently set at 327 meters wave-length, which was to be the\r\nwave-length of his endowed broadcasting station. I don\'t know how\r\nRemington Solander first got his remarkable idea, but just about that\r\ntime an undertaker in New York had rigged up a hearse with a phonograph\r\nso that the hearse would loud-speak suitable hymns on the way to the\r\ncemetery, and that may have suggested the loud-speaking tomb to\r\nRemington Solander, but it is not important where he got the idea. He\r\nhad it, and he was set on having it carried out.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Think," he said, "of the uplifting effect of it! On the highest spot in\r\nthe cemetery will stand my noble tomb, loud-speaking in all directions\r\nthe solemn and holy words and music I have collected in my fourteen\r\nvolumes. All who enter the cemetery will hear; all will be ennobled and\r\nuplifted."\r\n\r\nThat was so, too. I saw that at once. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
I said so. So Remington Solander\r\nwent on to explain that the income from the five hundred thousand\r\ndollars would be set aside to keep "A" batteries and "B" batteries\r\nsupplied, to keep the outfit in repair, and so on. So I tackled the job\r\nrather enthusiastically. I don\'t say that the five-thousand-dollar fee\r\ndid not interest me, but I did think Remington Solander had a grand\r\nidea. It would make our cemetery stand out. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
People would come from\r\neverywhere to see and listen. The lots in the new addition would sell\r\nlike hot cakes.\r\n\r\nBut I did have a little trouble with the other trustees. They balked\r\nwhen I explained that Remington Solander wanted the sole radio\r\nloud-speaking rights of our cemetery, but some one finally suggested\r\nthat if Remington Solander put up a new and artistic iron fence around\r\nthe whole cemetery it might be all right. They made him submit his\r\nfourteen volumes so they could see what sort of matter he meant to\r\nbroadcast from his high-class station, and they agreed it was solemn\r\nenough; it was all solemn and sad and gloomy, just the stuff for a\r\ncemetery. So when Remington Solander agreed to build the new iron fence\r\nthey made a formal contract with him, and I drew up the clause for the\r\nwill, and he bought six lots on top of the high knoll and began erecting\r\nhis marble mausoleum.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor eight months or so Remington Solander was busier than he had ever\r\nbeen in his life. He superintended the building of the tomb and he had\r\non hand the job of getting his endowed radio station going--it was given\r\nthe letters WZZZ--and hiring artists to sing and play and speechify his\r\nfourteen volumes of gloom and uplift at 327 meters, and it was too much\r\nfor the old codger. The very night the test of the WZZZ outfit was made\r\nhe passed away and was no more on earth.\r\n\r\nHis funeral was one of the biggest we ever had in Westcote. I should\r\njudge that five thousand people attended his remains to the cemetery,\r\nfor it had become widely known that the first WZZZ program would be\r\nreceived and loud-spoken from Remington Solander\'s tomb that afternoon,\r\nthe first selection on the program--his favorite hymn--beginning as the\r\nfuneral cortege left the church and the program continuing until dark.\r\n\r\nI\'ll say it was one of the most affecting occasions I have ever\r\nwitnessed. As the body was being carried into the tomb the loud speaker\r\ngave us a sermon by Rev. Peter L. Ruggus, full of sob stuff, and every\r\none of the five thousand present wept. And when the funeral was really\r\nfinished, over two thousand remained to hear the rest of the program,\r\nwhich consisted of hymns, missionary reports, static and recitations of\r\nreligious poems. We increased the price of the lots in the new addition\r\none hundred dollars per lot immediately, and we sold four lots that\r\nafternoon and two the next morning. The big metropolitan newspapers all\r\ngave the Westcote Cemetery full page illustrated articles the next\r\nSunday, and we received during the next week over three hundred letters,\r\nmostly from ministers, praising what we had done.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut that was not the best of it. Requests for lots began to come in by\r\nmail. Not only people in Westcote wrote for prices, but people away over\r\nin New Jersey and up in Westchester Country, and even from as far away\r\nas Poughkeepsie and Delaware. We had twice as many requests for lots as\r\nthere were lots to sell, and we decided we would have an auction and let\r\nthem go to the highest bidders. You see Remington Solander\'s Talking\r\nTomb was becoming nationally famous. We began to negotiate with the\r\nowners of six farms adjacent to our cemetery; we figured on buying them\r\nand making more new additions to the cemetery. And then we found we\r\ncould not use three of the farms.\r\n\r\nThe reason was that the loud speaker in Remington Solander\'s tomb would\r\nnot carry that far; it was not strong enough. So we went to the\r\nexecutors of his estate and ran up against another snag--nothing in the\r\nradio outfit in the tomb could be altered in any way whatever. That was\r\nin the will. The same loud speaker had to be maintained, the same\r\nwave-length had to be kept, the same makes of batteries had to be used,\r\nthe same style of tubes had to be used. Remington Solander had thought\r\nof all that. So we decided to let well enough alone--it was all we could\r\ndo anyway. We bought the farms that were reached by the loud speaker and\r\nhad them surveyed and laid out in lots--and then the thing happened!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYes, sir, I\'ll sell my cemetery stock for two cents on the dollar, if\r\nanybody will bid that much for it. For what do you think happened? Along\r\ncame the Government of the United States, regulating this radio thing,\r\nand assigned new wave-lengths to all the broadcasting stations. It gave\r\nRemington Solander\'s endowed broadcasting station WZZZ an 855-meter\r\nwave-length, and it gave that station at Dodwood--station PKX--the\r\n327-meter wave-length, and the next day poor old Remington Solander\'s\r\ntomb poured fourth "Yes, We Ain\'t Got No Bananas" and the "Hot Dog"\r\njazz and "If You Don\'t See Mama Every Night, You Can\'t See Mama At All,"\r\nand Hink Tubbs in his funny stories, like "Well, one day an Irishman and\r\na Swede were walking down Broadway and they see a flapper coming towards\r\nthem. And she had on one of them short skirts they was wearing, see? So\r\nMike he says \'Gee be jabbers, Ole, I see a peach.\' So the Swede he says\r\nlookin\' at the silk stockings, \'Mebby you ban see a peach, Mike, but I\r\nban see one mighty nice pair.\' Well, the other day I went to see my\r\nmother-in-law--"\r\n\r\nYou know the sort of program. I don\'t say that the people who like them\r\nare not entitled to them, but I do say they are not the sort of programs\r\nto loud-speak from a tomb in a cemetery. I expect old Remington Solander\r\nturned clear over in his tomb when those programs began to come through.\r\nI know our board of trustees went right up in the air, but there was not\r\na thing we could do about it. The newspapers gave us double pages the\r\nnext Sunday--"Remington Solander\'s Jazz Tomb" and "Westcote\'s Two-Step\r\nCemetery." And within a week the inmates of our cemetery began to move\r\nout. Friends of people who had been buried over a hundred years came and\r\nmoved them to other cemeteries and took the headstones and monuments\r\nwith them, and in a month our cemetery looked like one of those Great\r\nWar battlefields--like a lot of shell-holes. Not a man, woman or child\r\nwas left in the place--except Remington Solander in his granite tomb on\r\ntop of the high knoll. What we\'ve got on our hands is a deserted\r\ncemetery.\r\n\r\nThey all blame me, but I can\'t do anything about it. All I can do is\r\ngroan--every morning I grab the paper and look for the PKX program and\r\nthen I groan. Remington Solander is the lucky man--he\'s dead.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ April 1956 and was\r\n    first published in _Amazing Stories_ June 1927.
