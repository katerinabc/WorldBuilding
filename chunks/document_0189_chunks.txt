He\r\nlistened critically to the measured clicking of the Geiger counters\r\nand the quiet sibilance of the air purifiers, and in spite of his\r\nweightlessness and his total loss of equilibrium he was quite calm.\r\n\r\nBut deep inside him, under his trained calmness, Maynard felt a\r\nsteadily growing triumph, a swelling exultation that was a thing quite\r\napart from scientific pride. The feeling that he was a pioneer, an\r\nadvance guard for a conquering people, elated him and multiplied the\r\neagerness in him when he turned his eyes to the forward port where\r\nMars hung, full and ruddy, a spotted enigmatic disc of promise.\r\n\r\nEarth hung in the after port behind and below him, a soft emerald\r\ncrescent in its first thin quarter. A warm green sickle that was home,\r\na hustling verdant young world impatient to push its way across black\r\nempty space and satisfy its lusty curiosity about its cosmic neighbors.\r\n\r\nHe was at the end of his second day out, and he had covered roughly\r\nhalf of the distance he must travel. The atomic jets had cut off long\r\nago, at escape velocity, and would not come on again until they were\r\nneeded to slow his approach. The midpoint lay just ahead; in a matter\r\nof minutes now he would leave Earth's waning field and fall free into\r\nthe grasp of the red planet.\r\n\r\nHe was watching the cobalt ball of the Meinz pendulum quiver on its\r\nthin quartz thread with the first fluttering release of Earth's gravity\r\nwhen the fear came.\r\n\r\nTerror struck him suddenly, galvanically, blanking out all reason and\r\nall sensation. The control cubicle whirled giddily before his eyes, and\r\nthe abysmal panic that gripped his mind was a monstrous thing boiling\r\nup out of unguessed subconscious depths. It froze him, breathing, like\r\na man paralyzed under an overwhelming electric shock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Then terror struck!_]\r\n\r\nIt was not fear of death. It was not even his own fear.\r\n\r\nIt was the blind panic of Something inside him whose existence he\r\nhad never remotely suspected, Something that shrieked soundlessly in\r\nsenseless maniac terror and fought to tear Itself free of him.\r\n\r\nHe was torn by the struggle for an interminable instant, and then it\r\nwas over. He felt it writhe loose from the encumbrance of his mind,\r\nlike a madman writhing out of a strait-jacket, and then It was falling\r\nback toward Earth, away from him. He could sense It plainly, once It\r\nwas outside him--a malevolent, intangible Thing that fell back swiftly\r\ntoward the emerald crescent of Earth.\r\n\r\nHe sat for a moment dazed while breath came back into his lungs and the\r\nsteel-panelled cubicle grew steady again before his starting eyes.\r\nAnd, when It had gone in the distance and he could no longer feel\r\nthe frenzy of Its terror, he felt the swift unbounded freedom that a\r\nspirited horse feels when it has, unexpectedly, lost its rider.\r\n\r\nHe was still Robert Maynard, but with a difference.\r\n\r\n_He was free._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe feeling of utter freedom staggered him. For the first time in his\r\nlife he possessed himself entirely, without doubt or reservation, a\r\ncomplete and serene entity. He could feel his consciousness still\r\nexpanding, reaching into every hidden corner of his mind and taking\r\ncontrol of functions he had not dreamed of before.\r\n\r\nAn analogy occurred to him in perfect exactness of detail: he was like\r\na man waking from a vague world of sleep to find that what he had\r\nthought a single small room was in reality a spacious house. There\r\nwere other rooms than the cramped chamber he had lived in all his\r\nlife--rooms that had been tenanted a moment before by Something else,\r\nbut which lay open and ready for his own use now that their Tenant was\r\ngone. A moment before his ego had occupied a meager one-twelfth of his\r\nbrain; with Its departure the whole of his mind was his.\r\n\r\nAs suddenly as that he knew what had happened to him and why, and his\r\nincredibly-multiplied intelligence arranged the details of it precisely\r\nfor his consideration.\r\n\r\nHe had been host to a parasitic intelligence, without knowing it, all\r\nhis life. He had moved at Its dictates, following his own will only\r\nwhen It slept or tired or was distracted, never succeeding fully in any\r\nendeavor of his own because It was in control and must be obeyed. He\r\nknew when he had explored the vacated premises of his newly freed mind\r\nthat It was only one of many, that all earthmen had Tenants like It,\r\nintangible parasitic entities subsisting upon and controlling the human\r\nlife force.\r\n\r\nHe thought: _No wonder we have wars on Earth! We have no common ground\r\nfor agreement because we are under Their compulsion.

They know our\r\ninherent abilities and keep us at each others' throats lest we learn\r\nof and destroy them. Everything that man has accomplished has been done\r\nin spite of Them._\r\n\r\nHe looked with new eyes at the instrument panel under the forward port\r\nand was astonished at the crudity of the engines it controlled. He was\r\nprimarily an astrophysicist, and his understanding of atomic propulsion\r\nhad been negligible; now its every function was clear to him at a\r\nglance. Experimentally he drew a graph of the arc he described through\r\nspace, and knew to a minute how long it would be before the braking\r\njets slowed his speed for landing.\r\n\r\nHe raised his eyes to the forward port where the ruddy disc of Mars\r\nhung framed against the black velvet backdrop of space like a red jewel\r\nburning dully among a random display of lesser brilliants, beckoning\r\nhim on with the future's illimitable promise.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe sat quite still for a time on the padded control couch, thinking\r\nintently, testing the new powers of his mind as he might have flexed a\r\nnewly discovered limb.\r\n\r\nHis first conclusion was inescapable: his Tenant had left him because\r\nIt could not exist outside Earth's gravity. It had been forced to quit\r\nhim or perish, and Its departure had made him the first really free man.\r\n\r\nThey were not invincible.

They were not even particularly intelligent,\r\nin spite of Their gift of parasitic control, or his own Tenant would\r\nhave known Its danger. The fact that They were gravity-bound entities\r\ngave him the first vulnerable chink in Their armor, an Achilles heel\r\nthat offered eventual salvation for men. There would be other ways to\r\nbe rid of Them, and it was his responsibility as the first free man to\r\nsee that others of his kind were freed as he had been.\r\n\r\nHe pictured the harmonious integration of an Earth peopled by free\r\nmen and saw clearly the heights men might reach unhampered by their\r\nTenants. His own possibilities, when he had summed them up, awed him in\r\ntheir extent. There were no limits to what he could do, no bounds to\r\nthe knowledge he could accumulate and use.\r\n\r\n_This is what being a man is really like. I can liberate a world. Like\r\nMoses, I can set my people free._\r\n\r\nThe thought set his face shining, suffused him with a glow of\r\nanticipated triumph. It was all so simple, now that he was free....\r\n\r\nIn a few hours he would land on Mars, and in a matter of minutes he\r\ncould set up a beam transmitter to report back to the scientific\r\nfoundation that had sent him out. He could not tell his fellows the\r\ntruth because they were still captive, and their Tenants must not\r\nbe warned; but he could invent a plausible story of easily acquired\r\nwealth on Mars that would bring other and larger commercial expeditions\r\nswarming after him. With the help of other freed men he could found a\r\nnew civilization on the red planet, develop means to carry the fight\r\nback to Earth and exterminate the Tenants utterly. It would take time,\r\nbut in the end men would be free.\r\n\r\nThe Meinz centrifuge spun slowly, and with the swing of its cobalt ball\r\nMaynard felt the shift from terrestrial to Martian gravity. He felt the\r\nfirst tiny tug of weight and the slow returning of equilibrium as his\r\nbody oriented itself to the growing pull of the new attraction.\r\n\r\nWith the return of equilibrium he suddenly realized that he was upside\r\ndown and turned to the control board for correction. The cubicle\r\nrighted itself, rotating gently until the ruddy expanding disc of Mars\r\nhung below and ahead of the forward port. The Meinz pendulum ceased to\r\noscillate, the little cobalt ball hanging stiffly at the end of its\r\ntaut quartz filament.\r\n\r\nHe was well into the Martian attraction field by now. He made a quick\r\ncalculation (which once would have taken painstaking hours) and knew\r\nthat he would release the first braking blast from his forward jets\r\nin precisely ten hours. The little ship would nose into a slowly\r\ntightening spiral, avoiding the odd-planed orbits of the two tiny moons\r\nand, within minutes of establishing his declaration track, he would be\r\nready to land.\r\n\r\nHe watched eagerly as the red disc of Mars swelled to a mottled globe,\r\nblurred already at the edges by atmospheric refraction. Down there on\r\nthe dead ground of that ancient world he would set up his equipment and\r\nflash back his triumphant message to Earth, a fabulous exultant lie\r\nthat would bring other men like him swarming to the red planet.\r\n\r\n_Free men! Supermen, really, in a new free world. Nothing impossible,\r\nthen!_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLater, he shut off the braking blast of the forward jets and felt\r\nthe soft rubber-foam padding of the couch rise gently under him as\r\ndeceleration ceased. He was well into his landing spiral, eating up the\r\npaltry thousands of miles that lay between him and the shining future.\r\n\r\nHe lay back on the couch, smiling, his mind busy with the message he\r\nwould beam back to Earth, planning already the campaign he would carry\r\nout. Years must pass before men were freed completely of their Tenants,\r\nperhaps decades, but time did not matter. It was essentially a simple\r\ntask because he and those to come after him would be free of Their\r\ncompulsion--serene unhampered supermen to whom time was nothing.\r\n\r\nIn the end they could not fail....\r\n\r\nSomething impinged sharply upon his new perception, a chill groping\r\ntentacle of questioning intelligence. The smile froze on his face;\r\nhe sat up stiffly, numbled with the unforeseen horror of what was\r\nhappening to him. The groping ceased, and the hungry Intelligence from\r\noutside poured into his mind like smoke into an empty room, smothering\r\nhis feeble attempt at resistance.\r\n\r\nHe rose and went to the forward port, staring dully down at the\r\nuprushing sandy wastes and trying to recall what glorious thing it\r\nwas that he had been thinking. Or had it been only a dream? Somewhere\r\nin the farthest recess of his blunted consciousness a thought formed\r\nand floated like a bubble up into his awareness; but like a bubble it\r\nburst, and its meaning was lost on him.\r\n\r\n_There were Tenants on Earth_, it said. _Why not on Mars, too?_\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
