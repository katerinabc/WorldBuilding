"I\'ve\r\ngot to get on that ship! 

=== Chunk 2 ===
I\'ve got to, I tell you! 

=== Chunk 3 ===
And I\'m going to make\r\nit!"\r\n\r\nDifferent members of the group regarded him variously, some with\r\namusement, some with contempt, others with frank curiosity.\r\n\r\n"You\'re plain nuts, Joe. What do you want to go to the Moon for?"\r\n\r\n"Sure, why you wanna go? What they got on the Moon we ain\'t got right\r\nhere?"\r\n\r\nThere was general laughter from the dozen or so who sat eating their\r\nlunch in the shade of Building B. They all thought that was a pretty\r\ngood one. Good enough to repeat. "Sure, what they got on the Moon we\r\nain\'t got here?"\r\n\r\nBut Joe Spain wasn\'t in the mood for jokes. He burned with even greater\r\nconviction and stood up as though to harangue the workers. "You wanta\r\nknow why I got to go to the Moon? Why I\'ve got to get on that ship? Then\r\nI\'ll tell you. It\'s \'cause I\'m a little guy--that\'s why! Joe\r\nSpain--working stiff--one of the great inarticulate masses."\r\n\r\nMore laughter. "Where\'d you get those big words, Joey? 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Out of a book?\r\nCome on--talk English!"\r\n\r\nJoe Spain pointed to the huge, tubelike Building A, off across the\r\ndesert; the building you had to have two different passes and a written\r\npermit to enter. The mystery building where even newspaper reporters\r\nwere barred. "It\'s only the big shots they let in there ain\'t it? 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Only\r\nthem that\'s got a drag or went to college or something. Us little guys\r\nthey tell go to blow--ain\'t that right?"\r\n\r\n"Who the hell cares? Maybe it\'s a damn good place to stay away from.\r\nMaybe it\'ll explode or something. Who wants to die and collect his\r\ninsurance?"\r\n\r\n"I got to get on that ship when it blasts off because they can\'t push\r\nthe masses around! We got a right to be represented even if we got to\r\nsneak in!"\r\n\r\n"Me--I\'ll stay on the ground."\r\n\r\n"And besides there\'s the glory! You guys are too stupid to see that but\r\nit\'s there. The glory of being on the first rocket ship to the Moon. The\r\nname of Joe Spain written down in the history books and said over by\r\npeople and school kids for thousands of years! Immortality! That\'s the\r\nword!

=== Chunk 6 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Well, just forget about it, Joe, \'cause you ain\'t going."\r\n\r\nJoe Spain\'s eyes burned brighter. "Joe Spain, coming down the ramp with\r\nthe big shots when it\'s all over. News cameras snapping! People asking\r\nfor interviews!"\r\n\r\n"But you ain\'t going \'cause--"\r\n\r\nJoe shouted the man down. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
"And another thing. Us little people are\r\nentitled to a representative aboard that ship. We got a right to know\r\nwhat\'s going on. How come there\'s nothing about it in the papers? Only\r\nthe big shots knowing about it and whispering among themselves? It\'s\r\nbecause they\'re trying to snag it all and freeze us out!"\r\n\r\n"You\'re crazy. It\'s for security reasons. It\'s all hush-hush so it won\'t\r\nleak out like the atom bomb did. The big boys are being smart this\r\ntime."\r\n\r\n"And you ain\'t getting on," the interrupted man repeated doggedly,\r\n"because there ain\'t a way in God\'s world to _get_ on. With triple\r\nsecurity all around the building, just tell me a way to get in. Just\r\ntell me one."\r\n\r\n"I\'m going to get on that ship," Joe Spain said. Then he clammed up\r\nsuddenly. Joe Spain wasn\'t stupid. He was a talker, but he knew when to\r\nstop sounding off.\r\n\r\nThe men went back to work shifting the big aluminum barrels from trucks\r\ninto Building B. Carrying the wooden crates and the paper-wrapped\r\nparcels up the ramps and to the side of the building facing the big\r\nsecret structure labeled A. They worked until five o\'clock. Then they\r\nfiled out and got into the waiting trucks and were hauled back to town;\r\nthe boom town that had mushroomed up in the desert overnight and would\r\ndie with the same swiftness when the project was completed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJoe went straight to his rooming house, washed up, put on his good\r\nclothes, and found a stool in a nearby restaurant. He ate a leisurely\r\nsupper, glancing now and again at the clock. When the clock read eight,\r\nhe went out into the neon-stained darkness and walked three blocks to\r\nthe Black Cat, one of the three night clubs the desert town boasted. He\r\nwent to the bar and ordered a drink. He downed it slowly, carefully,\r\nafter the manner of a man who wanted to stay sober.\r\n\r\nA half-hour passed before a thin, nervous individual elbowed to the bar\r\nand stood beside him. Joe said. "Hello, Nick. You been thinking it\r\nover?"\r\n\r\n"I need a drink."\r\n\r\n"Sure, Nick. Then we\'ll go some place and talk." But Nick got rid of\r\nfive drinks while Joe protected his own glass from the barkeep. After a\r\nwhile, Joe said, "I\'m willing to up the price, Nick. Two thousand--cash.\r\nAll I got."\r\n\r\n"Le\'s get out o\' here," Nick mumbled.\r\n\r\nThey walked out of the town and into the desert, Nick stumbling now and\r\nagain, to be supported by the tense, sober Joe. "Two thousand, Nick. You\r\nneed the dough."\r\n\r\n"Sure. Need the dough. But it wouldn\'t work. Couldn\'t get you into one\r\no\' them barrels."\r\n\r\n"You wouldn\'t have to. All I ask is that you come along in the morning\r\nand seal me up in one. All you\'ll have to do is lock on the lid."\r\n\r\n"How you know the barrels are going on the ship?"\r\n\r\n"Never mind about that. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
I just know. I paid to find out."\r\n\r\n"Okay--suppose you do get on the ship in a barrel. Maybe it\'ll be stored\r\nin a hold somewhere. Maybe they wouldn\'t open it very soon. You\'d die."\r\n\r\n"I got a way to get out. One of them special torches. The little ones.\r\nAluminum isn\'t very strong. I can cut it like butter."\r\n\r\n"It\'d be hot. You\'d burn yourself."\r\n\r\n"Let me worry about that," Joe said fiercely. "You want the two grand or\r\nnot?"\r\n\r\nNick wanted the two thousand and he was against the wall for excuses.\r\nThen he had a happy thought. "Barrels is air-tight. You\'d smother.\r\nThing\'s im--impracac\'l. We\'ll forget it."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t smother. I\'m taking my own oxygen. Enough to last me clear to\r\nthe Moon if it has to. Come on. Break down!"\r\n\r\n"Okay. For two grand. Got to have the dough now though."\r\n\r\nHis heart singing, Joe Spain counted out two thousand in cash. When he\'d\r\nfinished he had exactly nine dollars left. He was a pauper. But the\r\nhappiest pauper who ever bought with his whole fortune the thing he\r\ncraved most.\r\n\r\n"You won\'t double-cross me now, will you? If you\'ve got any ideas like\r\nthat--"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll do like we said. Nick Sparks never went back on his word--never.\r\nBut how you going to stay hid when it\'s time to leave work?"\r\n\r\n"Leave that to me. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
It\'ll be easy. They don\'t check Building B too close.\r\nNo double check \'cause it\'s over a mile from Building A--outside the\r\nsafety perimeter. I\'ll stay in tomorrow night and I\'ll put a little\r\nchalk-mark on the barrel I\'m in--right near the top rim. First thing you\r\ndo when you come to work the next morning is seal it and line it up with\r\nthe filled ones."\r\n\r\n"Okay, but I gotta go home now. I got a head. I gotta get some sleep."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"What\'s in the duffel bag?"\r\n\r\n"Clean overalls--towel." Joe pulled the zipper down halfway. The guard\r\nfingered the blue denim but didn\'t dig deeper to find the towel. He\r\nchecked Joe\'s badge number, made a note on his pad, and motioned to the\r\nnext worker. Joe let tight breath slowly out of his lungs as he walked\r\ntoward Building B. Getting past the guard was a load off his mind. He\'d\r\nexpected to get by, but it was one of the calculated risks that could\r\nhave stopped him cold.\r\n\r\nOnce inside the building, he put the bag into his locker and went to\r\nwork. He labored briskly and carried more than his share of the load.\r\nBut now and again he stopped to look over at the outline of Building A,\r\nlimned hard against hot blazing sky. And each time it was with a sense\r\nof heady exhilaration that he thought of his destiny--his hard-earned,\r\ndearly bought destiny. To be among that select group who would first set\r\nfoot upon the surface of the Moon!\r\n\r\nHe had no worries about not being allowed to do so. Once he showed\r\nhimself--with the ship far out in space--they\'d have to accept him. Not\r\ngraciously of course, but they\'d have to admire his courage and\r\ntenacity. They could not, in all humanity, deny him a share of the\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nThe day wore on and as quitting time approached, he became more\r\ntense--more alert. Five minutes before the whistle, he faded back into\r\nthe building and hurried to the lavatory. He went into the booth\r\nfurthest from the entrance and locked the door. Now there was nothing to\r\ndo but wait. Another of the calculated risks.\r\n\r\nThe whistle blew. Almost immediately, the sound of footsteps broke the\r\nsilence and the lavatory was filled with hurrying men. Their stay in the\r\nroom was short, however, as Joe had known it would be. Men leaving for\r\nhome do not dawdle on the premises.\r\n\r\nThe lavatory was empty again. A period of silence while Joe raised his\r\nfeet from the floor and braced them on the toilet seat. The entrance\r\ndoor opened. A guard making the departure checkup.\r\n\r\nJoe held his breath. If the guard came down the line and tried the door,\r\nhe was finished. But Joe had banked upon human nature. The guard\r\nstopped. For a long moment there was no sound and Joe knew the man was\r\nbending over to run his eyes down the line of toilets close to the\r\nfloor. In this manner he could see the floor of every booth. The guard\r\nstraightened, turned, walked out. The door closed. Silence. Joe\'s heart\r\nswelled with gratitude. He grinned, looking forward with joy to the long\r\nnight ahead.\r\n\r\nHe found a spot over behind the barrels where the night watchman would\r\nhave to climb over a lot of equipment in order to find him. He made\r\nhimself comfortable, practically certain the guard would not do this. He\r\nstretched out on the hard floor and recorded the passing of the hours by\r\nthe number of times the watchman went through.\r\n\r\nAnd he was surprised at how fast the time passed. Finally, checking his\r\ncount carefully, he left his hiding place and tiptoed to the line of\r\nlockers. He took the oxygen equipment from the duffel bag after which he\r\nhid the bag and the clothing therein behind a wall flange in a far\r\ncorner. Then he climbed into the barrel at the front end of the packing\r\nline. He checked the barrel with a small X, and jockeyed the lid into\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTime passed. Nothing happened. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
He wondered, if he\'d missed on the time\r\nelement. The men should certainly have come to work now. More than once\r\nhe was tempted to push the barrel lid aside and check the situation.\r\nWhen footsteps sounded, close by, and the lid snapped firmly into place,\r\nhe was glad he hadn\'t done so. Good old Nick! When he got back from the\r\nMoon, he\'d see to it that Nick got credit for his courageous act.\r\n\r\nSoon the barrel began to move. Joe felt it rise into the air and settle\r\nwith a thump. Then the motor of a truck roared and Joe knew where he was\r\ngoing. Straight toward Building A and the Moon rocket. There was more\r\nmovement until finally the barrel was set down for what appeared to be\r\nthe last time. Joe put the nose-piece of the oxygen tube into place and\r\nvisualized himself safe and snug in a storage room of the rocket.\r\n\r\nHe closed his eyes and went peacefully to sleep.\r\n\r\nHe slept a long time, to be awakened by a crushing--a wrenching--that\r\nall but drove his head down into his spine. The pain brought him sharply\r\nalert. He knew instantly what had happened.\r\n\r\n_Blast-off._\r\n\r\nHe braced himself against the sides of the barrel, and gritted his\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\nSoon it was better. Then no pressure at all. Only the fierce happiness\r\non his heart. He\'d set a course and won through! He was on the way to\r\nthe Moon!\r\n\r\nJoe let plenty of time elapse. He knew it was well over an hour later\r\nwhen he unlimbered the torch to cut an escape-hole in the barrel. This,\r\nhe knew, would be tricky. He could easily burn himself. The heat would\r\nbe intense.\r\n\r\nBut it wasn\'t too bad. The aluminum cut quickly, and in a matter of\r\nminutes he was standing beside his barrel. As he\'d suspected, it was a\r\nstorage hold. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
The pitch-darkness did not bother him. He\'d come prepared\r\nwith a small pencil flash that threw an adequate beam.\r\n\r\nHe found the door, opened it and went out into a long passageway....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow he\'d covered the length and breadth of the ship. He\'d found a lot of\r\nrooms--all in pitch-darkness. No observation ports.\r\n\r\n_And no living thing._\r\n\r\nHe stood frozen in one of the rooms while the beam of his flash picked\r\nout a code stenciled on a steel plate over some piece of machinery.\r\nX59-306MY--Experimental--Explosion Rocket--Moon.\r\n\r\nThe flash dropped from Joe Spain\'s fingers. He stood in the\r\npitch-darkness while the jets vibrated through the rocket.\r\n\r\nBut there was no fear in him. Only the great pain of futility. Only his\r\ntears, and his whispered words:\r\n\r\n"They\'ll never know. Nobody won\'t ever know!"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _If Worlds of Science Fiction_ March\r\n    1952.
