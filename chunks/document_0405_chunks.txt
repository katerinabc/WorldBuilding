It was discovered ten\r\nminutes after blast off. The killer--a great lout of an upper-hillman,\r\nsigned on the last moment to fill a sudden vacancy--bragged of the kill\r\nto his sergeant.\r\n\r\nBragged grinning. "He was crouched behind a rock peeking out at the\r\nship. I came behind him--very quiet. I broke his neck and--and did\r\nother things. He never knew what happened."\r\n\r\nThe guard was rushed immediately before the Commander--into the dread\r\nPresence. The Commander\'s eyes were terrible but his voice remained\r\nsoft. "You know by what a slim thread our invasion plans hang?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Commander."\r\n\r\n"You know that utter secrecy has been our key from the start?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Commander."\r\n\r\n"I just wanted to make sure before I execute you in the name of the\r\nSupreme Otarkian Council."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Commander."\r\n\r\nThe Commander drew his gun and aimed accurately. The guard died bravely.\r\n\r\nAnd that was that.\r\n\r\nBut there was worry. The Commander consulted with the Second. "It would\r\nbe wise to return."\r\n\r\nThe Second calculated time. "It would be high noon back there before we\r\ncould set down."\r\n\r\n"We could wait for darkness."\r\n\r\n"True."\r\n\r\n"But fifteen hours of daylight would have elapsed."\r\n\r\n"It is a lonely place."\r\n\r\n"But if a trap were set."\r\n\r\nThe Second considered. "When the body is discovered--what will it\r\nreveal? Nothing definite. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
No chain of logic could point to us."\r\n\r\nThe Commander frowned. "But success depends so completely upon secrecy.\r\nIf the experiment is successful--"\r\n\r\n"It will be, sir.

=== Chunk 3 ===
"\r\n\r\n"I hope so. Hold your course for home...."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe body of Mack Styles was found at two o\'clock that afternoon. By Tom\r\nBrazier and Frank Brooks, in a secluded spot on the Arizona desert.\r\nAfter he hadn\'t reported in they had gone out in a jeep to check up.\r\nThey saw Mack\'s jeep nosing up out of a pocket as though peering at a\r\nwhite alkali flat just beyond.\r\n\r\nThey rounded the pocket and found Mack and both of them got suddenly\r\nsick and strove to hide their shock from each other.\r\n\r\nBrazier said, "Jesus!" The word was both a curse and a prayer.\r\n\r\n"What could have hit him?"\r\n\r\n"Look at his legs. Broken--mangled. Like through a machine!"\r\n\r\n"A gorilla could do that."\r\n\r\nBrazier forebore the obvious retort and walked out onto the alkali\r\nflat. He stopped in its center and turned slowly, his eyes searching.\r\nThey found nothing. He went to the edge of the flat and began circling\r\nit slowly. In four places there were marks in the dust. The marks\r\nformed the four corners of a huge square. Something might have set\r\ndown there but you couldn\'t be sure. Probably dust-marks left by the\r\nswirling wind-devils that danced across the desert like miniature\r\ncyclones.\r\n\r\n"There\'s a town over there."\r\n\r\nTom Brazier looked up quickly. Frank Brooks had come to stand by his\r\nside and was pointing off through a declivity in the rocks.\r\n\r\n"Damned if there isn\'t. Ever see it before?

=== Chunk 4 ===
"\r\n\r\n"I think so. Isn\'t it the same town that lies about two miles off the\r\nNotched Butte road? The direction\'s about right."\r\n\r\n"Uh-huh."\r\n\r\nThey were Security men from the camp forty miles southwest; Brazier\r\nthe senior, gave the orders. As they started back, toward the jeep, he\r\nsaid, "Call in and make the report."\r\n\r\n"We aren\'t waiting?"\r\n\r\n"No. We\'ll move on to that town."\r\n\r\n"But we looked it over a week ago."\r\n\r\nTom Brazier frowned. "I know, but--"\r\n\r\n"But what?"\r\n\r\n"There\'s something funny about that town--something wrong."\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t see anything wrong with it."\r\n\r\nTom Brazier\'s eyes were vague. "I had it checked."\r\n\r\nThis surprised Brooks. "You didn\'t mention it before."\r\n\r\n"No. Nothing to mention, really. Something I can\'t quite put my finger\r\non."\r\n\r\n"Looks like a pretty old settlement."\r\n\r\n"It is. It began as a mining town back in 1890. Some silver veins out\r\nin the hills. They ran out though and the place became a ghost town\r\nshortly afterwards."\r\n\r\n"A short life and happy one."\r\n\r\n"Short, anyhow. After the silver piddled out they all left except\r\none or two old sand fleas. Since then it became a stop-over place for\r\ncasuals."\r\n\r\n"But there must be forty or fifty people there now. Where did they come\r\nfrom?"\r\n\r\n"Drifted in the last few years I suppose."\r\n\r\n"If you have any suspicions, we ought to check. Even if they can\'t be\r\nfrom outer space."\r\n\r\n"I took a spot check," Brazier said grimly. "The old coot who runs the\r\nhotel came originally from El Paso. A couple of the old uranium hunters\r\nrang true on background." There was a pause as they climbed the slope.\r\nThen Brazier\'s frown deepened. "But it isn\'t the people--they\'re not\r\nwhat bothers me."\r\n\r\n"Then what?"\r\n\r\nBrazier\'s voice was sharp. "I don\'t know, damn it!"\r\n\r\nBrooks was surprised. "All right--all right. Don\'t bite me about it.\r\nI\'ll send the message...."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey were silent as Brooks turned the jeep and nosed it over the broken\r\ncountry toward the village. Silent, but each occupied with his own grim\r\nthoughts; thoughts concerning things the nation had not been told; that\r\nthe flying saucer joke was no longer that but a very serious matter.\r\nCertain facts had come to light and had been discussed in high-level\r\nconference and they added up to good reason for panic. Creatures from\r\nouter space _were_ hovering over the planet. They were hostile and they\r\nwanted to take Earth over.\r\n\r\nAll the revelations were not catastrophic however if considered\r\ncomparatively. Fortunately, the aliens, while advanced and of superior\r\nintelligence, had physical characteristics that set them apart. They\r\ncould not put down and lose themselves among the planet\'s population.\r\nAlso, they did not appear able to overwhelm with superior weapons.\r\nStill, they were vicious, crafty, and their coming could mean the end\r\nof Terran freedom.\r\n\r\nBrooks rolled the jeep past a tilted sign reading, \'_Mesa Flats--Pop.\r\n21_\'. The lettering, very old, was almost obliterated.\r\n\r\nAnother ancient sign hanging over one of the false fronts said,\r\n_Elkhorn Hotel_. Brooks pulled up and the two Security men climbed out.\r\nTwo ancient desert specimens sat in tilted-back chairs on the porch.\r\nOne of them stirred enough ambition to turn his head. The other went on\r\nchewing tobacco and stared out across the desert.\r\n\r\nInside an equally leather-faced oldster presided behind the desk. He\r\nsaid, "Howdy, men," and extended a battered pencil across the register.\r\n\r\nTom Brazier signed. Frank Brooks looked about, trying to find something\r\nwrong. Failing in this he tried to conjure up the uneasy feeling that\r\nsomething might be wrong. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
He failed again. He said, "How long have you\r\nbeen running this place, Pop?"\r\n\r\n"Nigh onto ten years now. And the name\'s Frank Sibley, son. Never did\r\nget me a wife so o\'course I ain\'t nobody\'s pop."\r\n\r\nFrank Brooks grinned but as there was no rancor in the oldster\'s tone\r\nhe didn\'t apologize.\r\n\r\n"How is the food in the restaurant?" Tom Brazier asked.\r\n\r\n"Fair to middlin\'. _Frijoles_ and beans. Ain\'t nobody can spoil\r\n_frijoles_ and beans."\r\n\r\n"That\'s what you think," Brooks said.\r\n\r\n"Stayin\' long?"\r\n\r\n"A couple of days, maybe," Brazier told him. "Thought we might scout\r\nthe hills. If the area looks right we might bring in some small uranium\r\nequipment."\r\n\r\n"Good luck. Your room\'s to the head of the stairs--second door on the\r\nright."\r\n\r\n"Thanks."\r\n\r\nThey went out and moved slowly down the street. There were people but\r\nthey seemed used to strangers. There were desert-worn women, sun\r\nblackened children, leather-faced men.\r\n\r\nThe two Security men had been silent. Now Frank Brooks spoke suddenly.\r\n"If you\'re thinking about Quislings or traitors, Tom, it just doesn\'t\r\nmake sense. These people aren\'t intelligent enough. An invader would go\r\nwhere--"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not thinking about that. Let\'s eat."\r\n\r\nThey went into the restaurant and were served by a fat woman who\r\nwaddled back and forth from the kitchen, wedging herself through the\r\ndoorway each time. The food was acceptable, exactly what could be\r\nexpected in a place like this.\r\n\r\nOutside again, Tom Brazier stopped suddenly in the middle of the hot\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\n"What\'s wrong?" Brooks added.\r\n\r\n"Damn it! 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Damn it all to hell! 

=== Chunk 7 ===
I don\'t know! And I should know! I came\r\nback here to find out and I still know something\'s wrong but I can\'t\r\nspot it."\r\n\r\nFrank Brooks was concerned. "Tom, are you sure you\'re not just all\r\ntightened up about this whole deal?"\r\n\r\n"No, I\'m not. Look here--didn\'t you ever go through a place and\r\nremember it later as being--well, not quite right? Something you\r\nmissed, maybe?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid I\'m not the sensitive type but I get what you mean. Then\r\nagain, though, it _might_ be an illusion of some kind. You might have\r\nthe place mixed up subconsciously with another place of this kind\r\nyou\'ve seen."\r\n\r\n"Maybe. Let\'s take a walk around the whole town--look at it from all\r\nangles."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey walked. They climbed into the jeep and rode the slopes and\r\nthe _arroyos_. No one paid any attention to them. No one bothered\r\nthem. They spent the day and returned to town and ate again in the\r\nbleak little restaurant. The same woman pushed endlessly through the\r\ntoo-narrow doorway. When they went to their room the lamp cast such an\r\nunsatisfactory light that they put it out and went to bed.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement satisfied Frank Brooks completely. He was bone tired\r\nand sound asleep as soon as he hit the bed.\r\n\r\nBut not for long. He was awakened almost immediately, it seemed, by a\r\nprodding hand. He rolled over. "Whazza mat--?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got it!"\r\n\r\n"You got what?"\r\n\r\nTom Brazier did not appear to hear him. Brazier stood tensely beside\r\nthe bed holding the lighted lamp. His eyes were bright and hard.\r\n\r\n"They couldn\'t have been left here alone--without some kind of\r\nguidance--some means of command. There has to be something. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
Get your\r\nclothes on."\r\n\r\nBrooks was out of bed dragging at his pants. "Okay, okay. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
If you\'re\r\ngoing nuts, I might as well go with you. But what the hell will we be\r\nlooking for?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. Some kind of a machine maybe."\r\n\r\nThey were in the hall moving quietly through the darkness. "Anything\r\nlike that would probably be in a cellar or basement somewhere wouldn\'t\r\nit?"\r\n\r\n"You\'d think so. Under the biggest building I imagine."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right here--the hotel."\r\n\r\n"Let\'s look for a door."\r\n\r\nThey hunted quietly, making the sparest use of the pocket flashes they\r\ncarried clipped in their breast pockets. But they found no cellar door,\r\nno basement entrance, and ascertained, finally, that the building stood\r\non solid ground.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll have to check the other ones," Brazier said.\r\n\r\nThey found what they were looking for under the restaurant. They broke\r\nin through the back door and found a trap behind the counter. Brazier\r\nlifted it.\r\n\r\nA soft blue glow lit the narrow stairway and they went downward into\r\na steel-walled room in the center of which stood a shining machine.\r\nThough inanimate, the bright metal monster seemed to possess a life\r\nforce. Electrical impulses chuckled and muttered behind the glowing\r\nbulbs and dials that created mysterious profiles on its surface.\r\n\r\n"Well I\'ll be damned!" Frank Brooks muttered. "You figured it was here.\r\nWe looked for it--and found it! Now what I want to know is--"\r\n\r\n"We\'ve got to make a report. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
Let\'s just hope we get out of here alive."\r\n\r\nBrooks felt no great concern on this score. He was sure they had not\r\nbeen seen. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
He closed the trap and followed Tom Brazier out the back\r\ndoor. And stopped short.\r\n\r\nThey were all there--the inhabitants of Mesa Flat--the young, the old,\r\nthe men and the women. They stood in a quiet semicircle around the rear\r\nof the building. There was no indignation upon their faces, no anger\r\nin the group, no fury in the desert town. Only a silence that chilled\r\nFrank Brooks; quiet, set faces; bodies that began moving slowly forward\r\ntightening the semicircle.\r\n\r\nFrank Brooks saw Tom Brazier\'s hand go under his coat and Brooks still\r\ncouldn\'t believe it. _Not shoot them down._\r\n\r\nBrazier fired point blank at the nearest man.\r\n\r\nIn a seeming daze, Frank Brooks stared. Two slugs, dead center in the\r\nchest, but the man came on. Shuddered slightly from the impact. But\r\ncame on.\r\n\r\nThen Brazier was bellowing, "For crisake! Don\'t stand there! Defend\r\nyourself!" and Frank Brooks came out of his daze and was also\r\nfiring--at people who kept coming on until it was all nothing but a\r\nnightmare.\r\n\r\nBrazier\'s target was now reaching forth a pair of steady arms, reaching\r\nwith hands that would grip and kill.\r\n\r\nBrazier fired desperately. "They\'ve got to be vulnerable somewhere!" 

=== Chunk 12 ===
he\r\nyelled. "Somewhere you wouldn\'t expect."\r\n\r\nHe found the spot by chance. A desert rat\'s hands were upon him when\r\nhis gun exploded for what would have had to be the last time. The slug\r\nwent downward. The desert rat stopped, then crumpled slowly to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n"The left thigh," Brazier cried. "That\'s where the control is. Shoot\r\nfor their left thighs!"\r\n\r\nBrooks stopped the fat woman from the restaurant as her hands tightened\r\non his throat. He shook his head to clear his brain and found Brazier\r\nhad blasted a path through the solid mass in front.\r\n\r\n"Run!" Brazier shouted. "The hell with the jeep! Just run!"\r\n\r\nThey ran....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey dissected one of the bodies at the camp; standing around in a\r\nsilent group; stunned by the complete reality of the thing.\r\n\r\n"It even has a kind of blood." The Commanding Officer said. "The\r\nanalysis will be interesting."\r\n\r\nFrank Brooks pointed at the body. "That\'s not actually flesh? Not skin\r\nor bones?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and no," the Commanding officer said. "They\'re synthetics but\r\npossibly as good as our own."\r\n\r\n"Putting the control unit in the leg was a master touch," Tom Brazier\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nThe Commanding Officer, noting the tight faces about him, laid down\r\nhis scalpel and said, "This throws a grave light on the situation of\r\ncourse, but it isn\'t as bad as it seems. In fact, the discovery turns\r\nthe tide in our favor. Obviously they came down some years ago and\r\ndid away with the residents of Mesa Flat when there was possibly only\r\na handful of people in the village. These they recreated in the form\r\nof androids through a process we are not familiar with and then began\r\nadding to the population by feeding in more androids. Maybe there were\r\nmore than just a few natives in the beginning because our spot check\r\ncaught four authentic backgrounds."\r\n\r\n"But if they can create human beings--" Frank Brooks said.\r\n\r\n"The main thing is they evidently cannot destroy us by frontal assault.\r\nThus this attempt at infiltration. Obviously the project is in its\r\nexperimental stage. 

=== Chunk 13 ===
And knowing what to look for, we can take it from\r\nhere."\r\n\r\nThe commanding Officer smiled at Frank Brooks and Tom Brazier. "Good\r\nwork, you two."\r\n\r\n"But I had nothing to do with it, sir," Frank Brooks said. "The\r\nmeeting\'s adjourned...."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOutside, Frank Brooks turned on his partner. "I had no right to any of\r\nthe credit. Why didn\'t you let me say it?"\r\n\r\n"You said it," Brazier grinned.\r\n\r\n"Besides--it was a team job."\r\n\r\n"Like hell! I don\'t even know what tipped you off. You had no reason\r\nto jump out of bed in the middle of the night and go hunting for that\r\nmachine. Or did you?"\r\n\r\n"Remember when I said there was something wrong with that town?"\r\n\r\n"I remember, but--"\r\n\r\n"Figure it out. The original life of the town was only a few months,\r\nso up to that time it had a right to be without one."\r\n\r\n"Without one what?"\r\n\r\n"But with a continuous population for ten years, it certainly should\r\nhave had one."\r\n\r\n"One _what_, damn it?"\r\n\r\n"A graveyard."\r\n\r\nBrooks mouth dropped open. "Say--that\'s right. There wasn\'t a tombstone\r\nanywhere around!"\r\n\r\nTom Brazier was grinning. "So the superintelligent aliens defeated\r\nthemselves by being too meticulously careful. They destroyed the bodies\r\nof the natives they killed and tripped themselves up."\r\n\r\n"When all they had to do to really camouflage the layout was to bury\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"They ought to give you a medal, man!" Frank Brooks said fervently.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll settle for a cup of coffee. Come on.
