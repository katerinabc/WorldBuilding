=== Chunk 2 ===
]\r\n\r\n\r\nFrane Lewis enjoyed another sadistic shiver as he moved up the narrow\r\npassageway to the captain\'s control room. To his flared nostrils the\r\nwarm, moist air of the small space-freighter was still heavy with the\r\nsmell of death. A psychiatrist could have told him that this was a\r\nneural confusion of olfactory sensation with the perverted emotional\r\nexcitement of murder. But no physicians ever attended Frane\'s murders,\r\nexcept at inquests.\r\n\r\nThree crewmen, still warm, lay at their posts with bloody splotches\r\nstaining their tunic pockets. Two more chores aboard and his pay,\r\nfabulous pay, was earned.\r\n\r\nFor Frane simple plans worked best. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
He rapped on the gray magnesium\r\npanel. "Your lunch, sir," he called. Inside, a solenoid thumped. The\r\nport slid aside revealing the captain\'s square back outlined against\r\nthe white-sprinkled velvet of space. As the executive turned away from\r\nthe transparent nose dome Frane\'s weapon spoke its final invitation to\r\neternity. The captain\'s eyes clamped shut, and in the reduced gravity\r\nhe buckled to the deck in slow motion.\r\n\r\nThen Frane swore as the dimly lighted astro-pit revealed another\r\nperson. What was the navigator doing up here at this time of watch? The\r\ntall, uniformed second officer reacted even as unbelieving horror swept\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\nShoving off from the bulkhead Frane dodged the officer\'s lunge with\r\na quick side-step, but the motion smashed the side of his curly head\r\ninto a grip stanchion. His ears rang, and blood spurted from a forehead\r\ngash. In a cold rage he watched his opponent recover and crouch for\r\nanother spring. "Sucker! you could have died nice and easy. Now we\r\nshall see!"\r\n\r\nWith cruel deliberation he slipped his finger off the trigger and\r\nwaited for the spaceman\'s desperate dive. Up whipped the heavy hand\r\nweapon in a short, vicious arc that splintered jawbone with an almost\r\ncrisp, wood-snapping sound.\r\n\r\nSwiftly Frane secured the cabin door. Then he went about binding\r\nthe unconscious navigator with parts of his own uniform. When he\r\nwas through he stood for a moment trying to orient himself in the\r\nhemispherical room. He compared it to a chart sketch provided him on\r\nearth before he had stowed away in his special supply crate.\r\n\r\n"Piracy!" The word hissed into the silence with a quality of\r\nunbelieving. Frane swung and saw that his victim had regained his\r\nsenses.\r\n\r\n"Yeah, piracy. Didn\'t think it could happen, did you? They told you\r\nspace piracy was impossible, didn\'t they?"\r\n\r\n"You brutal, bestial, insane--" the navigator broke off as his smashed\r\njaw moved in spite of his gritted teeth.\r\n\r\n"Not insane, buddy, just irritated. You caused me some trouble, see?\r\nI\'m saving you, buddy." His hand came away from his face palm out and\r\nsmeared with red. "I\'m saving you for later."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe moved surely now, the details of location well in mind. A low placed\r\nlocker when opened spilled out the gleaming metalized space suit which\r\nwas prop number one in this stage play. A little nervously Frane\r\nfumbled with the unfamiliar garment.\r\n\r\nThe officer watched with dull eyes as the killer prepared to don it.\r\n"How--how many--men alive back there?"\r\n\r\n"Subtract three. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
That leaves eighteen, doesn\'t it? And you can write\r\nthem off as soon as I get these pajamas on."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t spill the air! For the love of Jupiter, don\'t spill the air! You\r\nhave the ship. Why murder us all?"\r\n\r\n"Orders. I don\'t make them, I just carry them out. For money. Big\r\nmoney. That\'s why I\'m here. I\'m reliable. Besides, your men might break\r\nout and pester me. They\'re locked in their quarters."\r\n\r\n"You mean you\'re alone?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m your man, space boy," Frane said with flat boastfulness. He caught\r\nup a strange webbed garment of nylon yarn. "What do you call this fish\r\nnet? It was in the suit locker."\r\n\r\n"You wouldn\'t know about that, you earthbound slug. We call it\r\nspaceman\'s underwear. Didn\'t your buddies tell you about it?"\r\n\r\nFrane shrugged, started to discard it and changed his mind. "Better put\r\nit on me, I guess. I suppose it\'s pretty cold when the air goes out."\r\n\r\nThrough twisted, motionless lips, the navigator told him, "Very cold.\r\nAbsolute cold. You won\'t live if you spill the air." 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Frane said\r\nnothing. The spaceman watched the killer strip off his clothes, slip\r\ninto the net garment and redress himself. Wool slacks snugged in at the\r\nankles and belted tightly to a felt jacket with a tight, soft collar.\r\nNow he proceeded with the space suit.\r\n\r\n"With enough air a man can live for weeks in one of these," Frane\r\nlectured to dispel a depressed feeling of confinement, as he tugged\r\nthe bulky space garment up and fastened it around his neck. "And I got\r\nplenty of air, see?" He uncoiled the length of silicon-plastic hose and\r\nplugged one end into the bubble helmet, the other into the wall valve\r\nof the control cabin.\r\n\r\n"How do you intend to navigate this craft?" the officer asked with\r\nhonest curiosity.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment\'s reflection Frane could see no reason to conceal the\r\nprocedure. He felt like talking. He had often talked to his victims\r\nbefore. Foolishly, perhaps, but his victims had never lived to repeat\r\nthe conversations. Nor would this one.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll be boarded in about twenty hours. They told me they couldn\'t\r\ntrail too closely or your radar would have alerted you. They\'ll have\r\ntheir own crew to take over."\r\n\r\n"Suppose they don\'t show up at all?" the officer needled.\r\n\r\n"They will. Don\'t you worry your silly little head over that.

=== Chunk 6 ===
"\r\n\r\n"But if they don\'t?" the prostrate man insisted. "You know, when you\r\nblow the main valves you can\'t close them again from the inside. You\r\nmay have plenty of air for that suit, but how will you eat? Breathing\r\nis just one problem in a space suit."\r\n\r\n"They\'ll be here inside of twenty hours, I told you."\r\n\r\n"And you\'ll be dead."\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"Because they double-crossed you good. Sure, they\'ll get the fattest\r\ncargo this can ever carried. But your share of it will be a shove\r\noutside. You\'ll be just as damned dead as I\'ll be."\r\n\r\n"How did they cross me up?"\r\n\r\nA ghost of a smile distorted the swollen face that had once been lean\r\nand handsome. "Find out," he said simply.\r\n\r\nIn spite of himself Frane checked back on his procedure. Purposely or\r\notherwise, could they have left out some essential step in order to\r\nreduce the number of splits on the cargo? He ticked off the steps of\r\nhis project and could find no reasonable omission. Carefully he fitted\r\non the bubble, opened the oxygen valve and made the meter read what\r\nthey had told him.\r\n\r\nThe hiss told him he was getting gas, but surprisingly, there was no\r\nperceptible motion of air in the helmet. Clever inlet baffles prevented\r\nthe chilly drafts that had plagued pioneer spacemen with head colds and\r\nsneezes.\r\n\r\nHe was sweating already, but, he reflected, it wouldn\'t do any harm to\r\nstore up a little body heat against the hours of this absolute zero\r\nthey talked about.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe checked the chronometer which he\'d strapped to the wrist of his\r\nsuit. "Right on time," he shouted in order to be heard through the\r\nplastic bubble. His bulky hand paused clumsily on the master air outlet\r\nvalve switch. He raised his other arm in a derisive farewell gesture.\r\n\r\n"Quick-frozen space punks!" he shouted. "Get them cheap from Frane\r\nLewis, wholesale triggerman." He laughed hoarsely as he jabbed the\r\nswitch.\r\n\r\nThe sound of air rushing from vents never intended to be opened in\r\nspace, screeched a shrill requiem even through the thick curved helmet.\r\nAs the sound grew fainter his suit bulged out and threw him off\r\nbalance. He toppled over and landed face down on the dying navigator.\r\nFor one grisly second the swollen, contorted face with bulging eyes\r\nglared at him, then he rolled away in a convulsed panic that ripped his\r\nair hose from its connection.\r\n\r\nThe hiss stopped, and almost instantly his rapid respiration fouled\r\nthe air of his tiny headspace. Frantic, mitted hands fought the slender\r\nhose back over the nipple, struggled with the safety clamp, and once\r\nagain the sweet air dribbled into his lungs.\r\n\r\nHe realized now there must have been an automatic valve in the air\r\ninlet, which had held his pressure until the connection was remade,\r\nwith a trace of new respect for the breed of spacemen, he wondered\r\nabout the poor fools who had suffered and died to provide the\r\nimprovements of this self-contained bit of earth environment. He\r\nwas now the only living speck of life on the desolated craft he had\r\nbetrayed to the frigid airlessness of space.\r\n\r\nFrigid? The exertion had sweat running down his face so freely that\r\nhis snug neckband was soaked already. His hand came up and rapped the\r\nbubble in an unconscious, futile motion intended to rub out the salty\r\nsweat from his stinging eyes and tortured head wound.\r\n\r\nStrange. The cold was not penetrating at all. Even at the several\r\npoints where his body and limbs made contact with the distended space\r\nsuit, no sensation of coolness struck through. His feet were moist and\r\nhot on the heavy cork soles.\r\n\r\nHe stared briefly at the two bodies near his feet. They were beyond\r\nexplaining anything. The smell of death came back to his nostrils.\r\nRight through his helmet? There was no smell out there. The smell was\r\nin here. With him. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Power of suggestion? The navigator had said he would\r\ndie. Sure. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
A safe statement. Nobody lived forever. But he\'d live long\r\nenough to enjoy his cut of this little deal.\r\n\r\nHis cut. The officer had said it would be a shove out into space. The\r\ndeath smell. His own death, perhaps. He laughed softly, and the sound\r\nof his voice thudded back to his ears like the intimate murmurings of a\r\nstethoscope. It was intimate in here. Every little whisper of breath he\r\ntook rustled loudly.\r\n\r\nDeliberately he cleared his throat and coughed. The sound was almost\r\nmetallic. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
It hurt his ears. Mingled with the tepid moisture of his own\r\nbreath was the faint odor of the powerful dessicant that ringed the\r\nbase of the helmet.\r\n\r\nHis eyes dropped to the row of tiny dials set just within eye-range\r\nunder his chin. Suit pressure, O. K. Oxygen, O. K. Humidity--the needle\r\nlay right on the red line. Well, when he stopped sweating from his\r\nscare that should drop off. Body temperature, one hundred one.\r\n\r\nOne-oh-one? Ninety-eight plus, he remembered from upper school hygiene,\r\nwas normal. Over a hundred was not so good.\r\n\r\nSit down, Frane. Relax. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
Get your breathing slowed down. Cool off.\r\n\r\nHe took the captain\'s comfortable chair before the low control panel.\r\nHe stared out into the incredible blackness of space, out where not the\r\ntiniest diffusion from the starlight eased the utter darkness between\r\nconstellations.\r\n\r\nSomewhere in the ship\'s electric generation system a moving part,\r\nbrittle with the cold and contracted within its bearing, vibrated\r\nbriefly and shattered. The control-room twilight flared and died out\r\ninto a shadowless night.\r\n\r\nFrane had the sensation of being projected out among the stars.\r\nLoneliness pushed in on him. He realized cynically that even the two\r\ncorpses had been better than this isolation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter a moment his pupils expanded so widely that the stars seemed to\r\ngrow larger, rushing in to meet the plunging space ship. The luminous\r\nneedles and dial faces of his helmet instruments became glaring little\r\nlanterns.\r\n\r\nEverything normal except humidity, slightly over the red line, and\r\ntemperature. Temperature: 102.5 F., he read. He wished fervently that\r\nhe hadn\'t put on that last garment. Spaceman\'s underwear, it was\r\ncalled. Or maybe it would have been better to--\r\n\r\nAn uneasy thought crept into the back of his head, and he strained his\r\nsmarting eyes down at the temperature gauge. In only a minute or two it\r\nhad advanced one tenth degree to 102.6 F.\r\n\r\nNow his breath rasped more rapidly as he gasped more oxygen. Pressure\r\nwas down slightly. He moved to the valve and adjusted it. On an impulse\r\nhe opened it wide for a second. The pressure needle pegged, his ears\r\npopped, but no coolness came from the baffled intake. He normalized\r\nthe pressure again.\r\n\r\nThe hose must be double-walled, he thought. The air should at least\r\nhave had the coolness of its own expansion. He wiggled inside his\r\nsweat-sopping clothes. Why didn\'t the perspiration dry off and cool\r\nhim? The answer came with uncomfortable clarity. Where could the body\r\nmoisture go? Where, for that matter, could the body heat go?\r\n\r\nTemperature: 102.9 F.\r\n\r\nFrane Lewis was no coward, but his hands began plucking nervously at\r\nthe space suit. The previously tough, folds of shiny, impermeable\r\nfabric were now distended into a rock-like rigidity.\r\n\r\nHe stood up suddenly, and his feet squished in his sandals. The sweat\r\nwas a puddle up over his toes. He was getting weak and thirsty. Very\r\nthirsty. He felt he must have no more water in him. He stood in a\r\ntrancelike state for minutes staring blindly into the heavens. His mind\r\nwouldn\'t work right. He hurt. He itched. He craved water, gallons of it.\r\n\r\nThen he stopped sweating. He had been deliberately keeping his eyes off\r\nthe temperature dial, forcing his mind away from a problem he didn\'t\r\nunderstand, when he felt his face go dry. The caked streaks of salt\r\nmade his skin feel stiff and itchy.\r\n\r\nTemperature: 104.3 F.\r\n\r\nFrane now knew he was sick. At that rate of increase he couldn\'t last\r\nmuch longer. His head was buzzing, and the fantasies of fever were\r\nflashing lights across his bleared vision. He strove to fight off the\r\nhallucinations. He focussed his eyes on the dim-faced chronometer and\r\nrealized with a start that he had endured over three hours of his\r\nvigil. Perhaps he could last out. Whatever the fever was, it must ease\r\noff sometime.\r\n\r\nHe staggered to the oxygen control, eased it open to full again and\r\nwatched the temperature needle for minutes. He became dazed. Then his\r\neyes came alive again, and he stared. Temperature: 104.5 F.\r\n\r\nHis hands drifted listlessly to the control again. This time he\r\nthrottled it down, down, below normal pressure. Slowly, slower than the\r\nminute hand of a watch, the needle climbed on. Why? _Why?_\r\n\r\nHis swollen tongue licked at dry lips. He couldn\'t swallow any more.\r\nAround his neck a salty puddle burned a ring of itching hell fire.\r\n\r\nHe choked down more on the air valve. It didn\'t make sense to him, but\r\nif more oxygen raised his temperature faster, then less should do the\r\nopposite. At 104.5 F a man doesn\'t always think straight.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt first his heart pounded loudly in protest. His breathing became\r\nquick and shallow. With staring, grateful eyes he watched the needle\r\nsettle a tenth of a degree and stay there. The mental relief was almost\r\noverwhelming. Had there been moisture left in his tear ducts Frane\r\nwould have cried. But now, with the strained concentration gone he\r\nbecame fuzzy. He slipped in and out of consciousness, and dead faces\r\nbegan drifting past his eyes.\r\n\r\nThis wouldn\'t do. He had one more job left. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
He looked at his\r\nchronometer. In another eight minutes he must throw the drive lever\r\nand kill all acceleration. The pirate ship\'s orbital prediction was\r\nbased on this timed interruption of the freighter\'s drive. So much as\r\ntwo minutes off, he had been impressed, would make their search hours\r\nlonger, since they were approaching from the rear at an angle.\r\n\r\nHe sagged into the pilot\'s chair again, but sitting down was no good.\r\nInstantly the ghost faces began their parade, and the death smell,\r\nmingled with the saturated dessicant\'s rank stink threatened to\r\nstrangle him. The belly full of rations he had force-fed himself to\r\nsustain him the twenty hours of waiting pressed heavily against his\r\nheaving diaphragm.\r\n\r\nHe gained his feet, stood with his hand on the fuel lever control and\r\nstared fixedly at his chronometer. Two minutes.\r\n\r\nThe navigator\'s swollen face, eyes bulging, stared into his helmet.\r\n\r\n"Get out of my way. Got to see my watch. Get--"\r\n\r\nHe brushed at the phantom as if it were a cloud of gnats. He was\r\nconfident now. The temperature gauge showed his body heat to be\r\nconstant at 104.4 F. Thirty seconds now and he could give himself over\r\nto his fever dreams. Twenty seconds.\r\n\r\nThe broken jawed image persisted mistily. But now the face was\r\nrepaired. It was the young tense face before he had crushed it with his\r\nblaster. It had that hard, determined look on it.\r\n\r\nThe fire in his body swept up into his brain. The bodyless image spoke\r\nsoftly, "You\'re going to die. You are going to move the fuel control\r\nthe wrong way. You can\'t remember which way they said to move it. It\r\nisn\'t marked. You can\'t remember.

=== Chunk 12 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I can!" The chronometer said twelve seconds.\r\n\r\n"You made one mistake. You put on your clothes over the spaceman\'s\r\nunderwear. Your body heat can\'t escape. Your brain is burning up. You\r\ncan\'t remember about the lever. You will move it the wrong way.

=== Chunk 13 ===
"\r\n\r\n"So what? Then I\'ll move it the other way," Frane screamed.\r\n\r\nThe tiny clock zeroed. Frane pressed the lever away from him. That was\r\nthe way to stop any earth vehicle--pressure forward on the air brake\r\npedal. He shoved hard.\r\n\r\nThe rockets roared out full blast far behind him. The building\r\nacceleration caught him and flung him stumbling back against the\r\nbulkhead. Then the firing took on complete departure blast rate.\r\n\r\nPinned like a butterfly specimen, eight G\'s smashed Frane Lewis\' space\r\nsuit against the metal wall. Lewis, being free inside the suit, was\r\npressed hard against the interior of its back side.\r\n\r\nThe cold he had been seeking struck through the wet, felt lining and\r\nhis exterior clothes. The thickly corded spaceman\'s underwear delayed\r\nthe frost momentarily, but then the sweat froze. The death smell seized\r\nhis throat. Dimly he knew what was happening, but he felt only heat.\r\nThe sear of an atomic furnace burning his shoulders, buttocks, leg\r\ncalves, through into his spine.\r\n\r\nThe heat--the terrible sear of space cold.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
