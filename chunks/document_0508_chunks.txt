Nothing has ever given me the thrill that reading\r\nhis first novel, _Roo-So Of The Jungle_, in installments of varying\r\nlength in the old _Thursby\'s All-Star Electrical Fiction Weekly_ did.\r\nUnless it was reading the twenty-three sequels, especially _Roo-So\'s\r\nRevenge_ and _Roo-So, Friend Of Animals_.\r\n\r\nThis present story belongs with Beemis\' planet adventure yarns. It was\r\nin the winter months of 1929 that Arthur Wright Beemis penned the first\r\nof his many scientifiction novels. In an era when space travel was\r\nlittle known or speculated on Beemis had his likeable two-fisted hero,\r\nHyacinth Robinson, travel between planets with ease. Hyacinth Robinson,\r\nas you may remember, had been standing too near a reservoir in upstate\r\nNew York and when the water evaporated he went with it, eventually\r\ndrifting to Venus where most of _Vandals Of Venus_ takes place. This\r\nstory was an instant hit and was soon followed by _Vagrants of Venus_,\r\n_Mermen Of Mars_, _Misfits Of The Moon_, _Plundered On Pluto_ and many\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nNow that many of Beemis\' books are freely available it was felt by his\r\nestate that his unfinished work should also be given to the public. So\r\nhere is the new Beemis we have all been waiting for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Chapter 1: A Minor Cataclysm\r\n\r\n\r\nMy heart was heavy as I drifted over the remote reaches of the Pacific\r\nOcean in the atomic powered Zeppelin the World League of Peaceful\r\nGovernments had thoughtfully allowed me to borrow in order to show\r\ntheir gratitude for my having ended the 4th World War several weeks\r\nahead of time with my lucky discovery of a powerful ray that made gun\r\npowder ineffectual. This balloon cruise, as pleasant as it was, had\r\nbeen planned as more than just a dedicated scientific attempt to map\r\nthe migratory routes of the Arctic Curlew. It was to have been, too, my\r\nwedding journey.\r\n\r\nAs I followed, with my binoculars, the happily paired curlews flapping\r\nto warmer climes I tried to think of some reason for the unpleasant\r\nturn events had taken. When I had called for my beloved Joanna on the\r\nprior morning her father, the noted munitions tycoon, John Plunderbund\r\nBrimstone, had left, not his best wishes for a safe honeymoon but,\r\nrather, orders for myself and my Zeppelin to be thrown unceremoniously\r\nfrom the grounds. All my leaden heart could be sure of was that I would\r\nnever again walk hand in hand with the handsomest, most athletic and\r\nyet feminine, girl in the state of New Jersey. The thought of what\r\nI was doing would have brought tears to my eyes had I not been as\r\nmasculine and manly as I am. For the curlew was the one bird that my\r\nJoanna and I had always thought of as _our_ bird.\r\n\r\nBut the rapid deflation of my Zeppelin vanquished all self pity from my\r\nmind. I was galvanized into action. Placing my binoculars back in their\r\ncase, I dived without further thought from the gondola of the falling\r\nZeppelin and into the placid waters of the Pacific Ocean. Perhaps some\r\nwell placed parting shot from one of the minions of Joanna\'s father had\r\ndone its slow work and been the cause of the untimely cessation of my\r\nmeans of transportation.\r\n\r\nI am an excellent swimmer and so there was no dread on my part of the\r\nlong swim ahead. However, I had barely covered a mile when I became\r\naware that something was tugging rather forebodingly at my ankle. My\r\nimpression was that I had caught my foot in the compelling maw of some\r\ngreat clam. Before I could reflect more the creature had pulled at me\r\nso forcefully that my head, the hair of which I wore in a somewhat long\r\nthough manly fashion, was yanked below the breath stopping waters of\r\nthe ocean in which I had so recently found myself. I fought bravely,\r\nbeing an excellent boxer. An old ring axiom has it that a good big\r\nman can beat a good little man. However, most rules of honest boxing\r\nwere not made with giant clams in mind. For one thing, I could not be\r\nsure if I was fouling the creature or not. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
As I struggled I became more\r\nand more lightheaded and giddy. As I drove an excellent jab home to\r\nwhat I hoped was a vital spot of the clam I suddenly lost consciousness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Chapter 2: The Mysterious Host\r\n\r\n\r\nI came to in a clean white bed with a large handsome man looking down\r\nat me. He was a striking fellow. To give you some idea I will simply\r\nsay that this man, whose name I soon learned was Lowell Hawthorne, was\r\neven better developed and more manfully handsome than myself.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve had a bit of a close shave, old man," he said, gripping my\r\nshoulder in a perfectly manly way.\r\n\r\n"American, aren\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Right you are, old man," he said. "Mabu, my native boy and Numba, his\r\nnative boy, fished you out of the briny. Scared the simple fellows a\r\nbit at first. They\'re not used to finding chaps such as yourself inside\r\ngiant clams. I had some talking to do to convince them you weren\'t a\r\nlarge pearl or some such thing."\r\n\r\n"I believe it is oysters rather than clams that are best known for\r\ntheir pearls," I said, good naturedly, for I took to this handsome,\r\nthough mysterious, American almost at once.\r\n\r\n"Who can tell a native anything?" was his honest reply.\r\n\r\n"I suppose I am to be laid up here for a time," I said.\r\n\r\n"A few days," said Hawthorne, drawing a bamboo chair near to my side.\r\n"If you don\'t object I\'d like to tell you a few of my adventures. For,\r\nif I do say so myself, my life has been both curious and strange."\r\n\r\n"By all means," I encouraged, being anxious to learn more of this\r\nenigmatic man who apparently lived contentedly here among savages and\r\ngiant clams.\r\n\r\n"I can tell by your look," he began, "that you are a man of science and\r\nthat you may at first be a bit skeptical. Let me begin by saying that\r\nfor the past five years I have been in close radio contact with a man\r\nliving inside the planet Venus."\r\n\r\n"Inside?" I asked. "Come, Hawthorne. Science is well aware that people\r\nlive on the outside of that damp junglous planet. But inside?"\r\n\r\n"Put aside all your scientific learning for a moment," my new friend\r\nreplied. "If you do you may learn something. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
At least you will have\r\nwhiled away your convalescence."\r\n\r\nSo he began the odd and compelling narrative that you will read in the\r\nnext chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Chapter 3: Down And Out On Mars\r\n\r\n\r\nI am the reincarnation, began Hawthorne, of an Egyptian priest, whose\r\nname if I were to mention it you would recognize as being as familiar\r\nto you as your own. Having lived several lives I reached this one with\r\nmore than the usual sense of ennui. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
I tried many things: shopkeeping,\r\nthe cavalry, gold prospecting, writing for the magazines. None of\r\nthese helped, nor could love. For in ancient Egypt I had loved a\r\nhandsome and sporting priestess named Isis. After her all other women\r\nwere anticlimactic. As Fate would have it, she whom I sincerely and\r\nrespectfully loved, never seemed to get reincarnated during the same\r\nera as myself. You know how women are about keeping appointments.\r\n\r\nOne evening toward the end of 1970 I was strolling through Central\r\nPark long after the hour when most men thought it safe. To a man such\r\nas myself, a man who fought the Red Indians without a qualm, the worst\r\nterrors of Central Park after dark held no dread. Still I was taken\r\naback when seven youths fell upon me with baseball bats. You have\r\nperhaps found, as I did that night, that even a superb physical being\r\nis no match for seven men with little respect for the correct way of\r\nlife, and large clubs. Though I maimed and injured a good number of\r\nthem I was nevertheless knocked unconscious.\r\n\r\nWhen I awoke and took a step I bounced twelve feet into the air.\r\n\r\nSome reappraisal of my surroundings seemed in order. Central Park had\r\nsurely changed considerably. It was now a great red desert. I took\r\nanother step and bounced again. Then the awesome truth came home to me.\r\nI was no longer in Central Park. I was on Mars.\r\n\r\nI am aware that you scientifically inclined chaps talk of space travel\r\nas being a remote possibility. You will realize, of course, that in\r\n1970 no such thing was even at the experimental stage. Therefore I knew\r\nI had been transported to the Red Planet by some mystical means there\r\nis no way to explain.\r\n\r\nI was still engrossed in seeing how high I could bounce when three\r\nlarge green men rode toward me mounted on gigantic hairy horses that\r\nboasted two extra sets of legs. The green men themselves were twenty\r\nfeet high and turned out to have, now that I noticed, an extra set of\r\ngreen arms. This is not the sort of sight someone who has only recently\r\nbeen battered with wooden clubs wishes to see on awakening.\r\n\r\nBut appearances are not always the best indication of the man and I\r\nsoon found my green welcomers to be quite decent. By means of a method\r\ntoo complex to burden you with we soon taught each other our respective\r\nlanguages.\r\n\r\nThe green men were named Yarl Zun, Zin Yerg and Yex Zurb. I explained\r\nto them that I had apparently transmigrated to Mars by some strange\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\n"You picked a bad time to transmigrate," said Yarl Zun, shaking his\r\ngreat green head.\r\n\r\n"Why is that?"\r\n\r\nThe three of them proceeded to explain to me as we shared a breakfast\r\nof kex, which is rather like our cold oatmeal, that Mars was in\r\nthe midst of a great depression. It seems that the head of their\r\ngovernment, the Daktor, who is roughly equivalent to two of our\r\npresidents, had been wooed into the camp of the more radical element\r\nin the Martian society and instead of listening to his Yax-Daktros, or\r\nwell-wishers as we would call them, and building up comforting supplies\r\nof zugbeams, or what we would call deathrays, he had foolishly poured\r\nthe taxpayers\' money into Yerb, which is something like our social\r\nsecurity. The result was rampant radicalism and poverty with little or\r\nno respect for Goomba, roughly equal to our patriotism.\r\n\r\nThe upshot of this enlightening political indoctrination was that I\r\nwould have a tough time making my way on Mars at the moment. Zin Yerg\r\nand the rest helpfully offered to bat me over the head with Zoobs,\r\nroughly equivalent to our baseball bats, in the hope that I might then\r\ntransmigrate back to Earth. I, though, having been an optimist in nine\r\nout of ten of my previous reincarnations, decided to brazen it out.\r\nStick I would and albeit I was down and out at the moment I felt I\r\nwould not be for long.\r\n\r\nSuch was indeed the case, as I will next relate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Chapter 4: The Great Games Of Maroom\r\n\r\n\r\nI threw in my lot with the green men who were, it evolved, enroute to\r\nMaroom, the capital of this country, to enroll in the Great Games. It\r\nis difficult for me to find a parallel on our own planet for these\r\nGreat Games. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
What transpired at them, as I was to learn only too well\r\nand shortly, was this. The blood-thirsty citizens of Maroom flock to a\r\nlarge stadium and there witness various fellows fighting one another\r\nand also great and ferocious beasts, of which there are many on this\r\ndepression-torn planet. Should a poor mendicant triumph in one of these\r\ngruesome contests he is awarded a cash prize. This explains why the\r\ndown-and-out of Mars flock to Maroom.\r\n\r\nTo Maroom then my new friends and I made our way. For although on Mars\r\nI was now called Yar Sud, or Shorty, I still vowed that I would beat\r\nany man or beast I came up against in fair combat. Especially if there\r\nwas money involved.\r\n\r\nWe had hardly reached the suburbs of the great and decadent capital\r\nwhen I heard a girl screaming in a tone that indicated her very honor\r\nwas at stake. Borrowing a sword from Yex Zurb I jumped from my riding\r\nposition just to the rear of his saddle and ran toward the scene of the\r\nstruggle.\r\n\r\nMy green acquaintances had informed me that the green men were not the\r\nonly race on Mars. There was also a pink skinned human type much like\r\nmyself only taller. Still I was not prepared as I dived into the murky,\r\nsward-choked alley between two crumbling ruins to see before me a girl\r\nof striking beauty of figure being pummeled by a large pink man in a\r\nleather suit.\r\n\r\n"One kiss is all I request," the man pleaded in a slimy voice that was\r\nfar from manly.\r\n\r\n"One will lead to another," the girl responded in a tone I admired.\r\n"Soon you will require other favors."\r\n\r\n"One little kiss. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
By Zarg (their idea of God)! If you don\'t kiss me\r\nquickly, Dina Taurus, I will have you locked away where kissing is out\r\nof the question."\r\n\r\n"Lock if you will," said the brave girl. "For kiss you I never shall."\r\n\r\nI waited to hear no more. "Stand, sir!" 

=== Chunk 7 ===
I cried. "The young lady does\r\nnot wish to be kissed."\r\n\r\nThe man was nearly eight feet high, though it was evident that his\r\npursuit of physical gratification left little room for a careful\r\nprogram of physical fitness. "Beat it, Yar Sud," he bellowed. "Do you\r\ndare to interfere with a Yax-Tarkas on his appointed rounds?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what a Yax-Tarkas is," I replied, "But I know that my\r\nblade will cut you down if you don\'t depart this woman\'s side at once."\r\n\r\nHis only reply was an angry grunt. He then came at me with sword drawn.\r\nIn my student days in Paris I had astounded my teachers with my ability\r\nas a foilsman. Fortunately, on Mars they fence in the Parisian manner\r\nand I was soon able to run the pleasure-bent Yax-Tarkas through and\r\nthen dispose of his body in a pit beneath the ruins.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to the heavy-breathing girl I suddenly gasped. "Isis!

=== Chunk 8 ===
"\r\nI cried. For she, indeed, it was.\r\n\r\n"My name is Dina Taurus," she replied. "I do thank you for aiding me.\r\nFor your kind act, though, I fear you will incur the wrath of all\r\nMaroom."\r\n\r\n"My own Isis," I continued. "Whom I have not seen for nearly two dozen\r\nreincarnations. Don\'t you remember me? Have you forgotten Egypt, my\r\nlove?"\r\n\r\n"You speak, sir, of love," the girl said in a tender voice. "I was\r\nabout to bring up the topic myself. I feel somehow that even though\r\nyou are shorter than most you are a man I could someday marry and kiss\r\nfreely. I fear I have never met you before."\r\n\r\n"Look, look," I said, beginning to draw a map of the solar system in\r\nthe dust of the alley with the tip of my recently engored sword. "Look\r\nthere." I proceeded to explain where the planet Earth was in relation\r\nto Mars and then where Egypt had been. I told of our great love on that\r\nspot. "No wonder I haven\'t been able to find you again," I concluded.\r\n"You\'ve been reincarnating here on another planet. Be that as it may,\r\nIsis, we are together again."\r\n\r\n"As you talk and as I look at your handsome face it comes upon me more\r\nstrongly that I am fond of you. Isis, however, I am not. Dina Taurus, a\r\nsimple shopgirl, is who I am. As Dina Taurus I sincerely hope you will\r\nfind your way clear to love me."\r\n\r\nShe was my own Isis and yet she had no recollection of it. I determined\r\nto court her under whatever name she was using. Once you have loved a\r\nwoman such as Isis it is hard to shake the habit. "Dina Taurus you\r\nshall be," I smiled. "Dina Taurus, I love you and ask your leave to pay\r\ncourt to you."\r\n\r\n"My leave you have had since the moment you leaped into this fetid\r\nalley," she replied tenderly. "Tell me, by the way, what is your name?"\r\n\r\n"My name is Lowell Hawthorne."\r\n\r\nFrom behind us a grim voice spoke, "Lowell Hawthorne, we take you\r\nprisoner in the name of the City and County of Maroom."\r\n\r\nA dozen heavily armed men had approached us quietly while we had talked\r\nof love. "What is the charge?"\r\n\r\n"Killing a Yax-Tarkas and throwing him in a pit. Come along with us.

=== Chunk 9 ===
"\r\n\r\nTo my new found Dina Taurus I whispered, "Just what is a Yax-Tarkas, my\r\nlove?"\r\n\r\n"The talent agent for the Great Games," she gasped as the lawmen carted\r\nme away.\r\n\r\nThat is how I came to be sentenced to fight in the arena of Maroom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Chapter 5: In The Dungeons\r\n\r\n\r\nMy cellmate in the dark stone room under the arena was a handsome\r\ntanned man named Joel Lars. We soon became fast friends, not merely\r\nbecause we were padlocked together but because we shared a great\r\ncommunity of interests and also believed in the manly virtues and a\r\nplanned program of daily exercise.\r\n\r\n"We will not be called into the arena for many days," Joel Lars told me.\r\n\r\n"Unfortunate," I said. "For I have only now re-met a girl for whom I\r\nhave searched many centuries on many worlds."\r\n\r\n"Too bad," he replied with real sympathy. "Speaking of girls, would you\r\ncare to hear my story?"\r\n\r\n"It would help pass the dark hours here."\r\n\r\n"It took place on Venus, which as you may know, is a planet in this\r\nsystem of ours."\r\n\r\n"I am a great admirer of that planet," I said, "Please to continue."\r\n\r\n"Of the overall surface of that planet I know little," went on Joel\r\nLars. "Of its interior I know only too much. For it is there that the\r\nonly woman I will ever love, Virl Yank, is at this moment a captive of\r\nthe fiendish Yes Men of Venus."\r\n\r\n"How does she happen to be inside Venus?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Let me go back a bit," said Joel Lars. "My parents were missionaries\r\nand one fine day they took their spaceship to Venus. Our crewmen proved\r\ndisloyal and in a dispute over shorter hours they threw my beloved\r\nparents and myself over the side. We were stranded in the steamy\r\njungles and my parents soon succumbed to the moist living. I, a mere\r\nboy of seven, survived and was raised to manhood by the Boogdabs, what\r\nthe Martians would call Yarznigs, roughly equivalent to the Earth\'s\r\ngreat apes."\r\n\r\n"What of the cursed Yes Men and your dear Virl Yank?"\r\n\r\n"Being raised by great apes has a strange effect on one," answered Joel\r\nLars. "It took several years of therapy to completely rid me of the\r\nidea that I might be an ape myself. I still dream sometimes that my\r\nmother was. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
Now, as to the Yes Men."\r\n\r\nHis narrative was cut short at this point by the arrival of a group of\r\nguards who flung our cell open and pulled us to our feet. "There has\r\nbeen a last minute cancellation," one of them, a coarse hairy fellow,\r\nexplained. "The star gladiator is ill and you two will have to go on in\r\nhis place."\r\n\r\nCLOSING NOTE: What transpired next would fill a book itself. And this\r\nis exactly what my agent has advised me to do with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
