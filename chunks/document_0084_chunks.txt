Polly had\r\nbrewed it. June thought it was too strong. Doris and Sue stayed out of\r\nthe argument at first.\r\n\r\nPolly defended, "Sure, it\'s a little stronger, but men like it strong.\r\nYou might as well get used to it."\r\n\r\nJune said, "See here, he\'s got to make some concessions. After all, why\r\nshould four of us suffer--"\r\n\r\n"Suffer? You call being married to Hollis Jamison suffering?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be so impressed. He\'s not doing badly marrying us, either. He\r\ncould do a lot worse."\r\n\r\n"Why, you vain witch! Just because you play a fair game of chess--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m not taking all the credit. You\'re a fine cook, Doris is witty\r\nand Sue\'s body would make any man\'s mouth water--but that\'s just the\r\npoint! Look what he\'s getting! Why should we have to change all our\r\nhabits and tastes to conform with his?"\r\n\r\nNow Doris entered the argument. "You know darn well why! It\'s still\r\na man\'s world and a man\'s choice. Back when there was a man for\r\npractically every woman, it was different. But it\'s five women to one\r\nman right now--don\'t ever forget that--five to one, and so far the law\r\nonly requires a quadracell. Just be grateful you aren\'t the one who\'s\r\nleft out.

You and your chess-playing! How far would you get attracting\r\na man, all by yourself?"\r\n\r\n"Shhh, now, all of you," Sue broke into the telepathic conversation.\r\n"Let\'s clear the dishes and get the apartment straightened up. Hollis\r\ndid make one concession--moving in with us, instead of making us live\r\nin that dismal bachelor\'s hole of his. Let\'s not make him regret it.

"\r\n\r\nThey heeded Sue and got busy. Sue was the arbiter. She ruled the\r\nquartet with a gentle but confident mind. All four knew that her lithe,\r\nathletic body with its soft curves and golden hair was the greatest\r\nasset in this transaction of matrimony.\r\n\r\nThere had been no dissension on this point, nor could there have been.\r\nThe bureau would never have allowed them to be together and form a\r\nmarriage cell had there been the slightest dispute.\r\n\r\nMany differences of opinion were allowable, but the four had been\r\ncarefully screened in certain matters of basic tastes. They liked the\r\nsame colors, foods, styles of clothing, video programs, sports and\r\nvacation activities. All were carefully schooled ambiverts of roughly\r\nequal education. Instead of conflicting, their differences of skills,\r\ntalents and personality traits complemented each other.\r\n\r\nEven with all this care in selecting and matching, however, the big\r\ntest was the culmination of the marriage, itself--the whole purpose of\r\nthis banding together. The unpredictable quality of the most stable\r\nfeminine emotions made the choice of a mate most difficult of all.\r\n\r\nThis awareness was in all their minds this day, and it made them a\r\nlittle nervous. Even the argument that had started over the coffee had\r\nbeen faintly alarming to Sue. They were a team, welded together by the\r\nwonderful gift of telepathy, which was only possible through formation\r\nof a marriage cell. The most complete intimacy of thought and feeling\r\nhad been nurtured for a whole year before marriage was permissible.\r\nSympathy, tolerance and sharing a common experience with mutual\r\nenjoyment and happiness was the keystone of the polygamous unions.\r\nNothing must spoil it now.\r\n\r\nThe delivery vault thumped, and the signal light flicked on. Sue rushed\r\nto slide up the door.\r\n\r\n"Orchids!" they chorused mentally, and Sue noticed with satisfaction\r\nthat June\'s thought was as strong as the others. The lovely flowers\r\nwere put in the cooler, the apartment was tidied and they turned to the\r\nexciting task of becoming beautiful for their handsome husband.\r\n\r\nThe tiff over the coffee was forgotten as they became immersed in\r\nsprays, powders, tints, cosmetics, body ornaments and the precious\r\nnuptial perfume. This latter, issued to them only yesterday when they\r\nsigned the register and received the license, was now as traditionally\r\nexclusive to weddings as trousseaus had been centuries ago.\r\n\r\nFeminine clothing, of course, had long since been eliminated from the\r\noccasion, along with other redundancies such as waggish and mischievous\r\nguests, old shoes, rice and hectic honeymoon trips.\r\n\r\nThe official and religious arrangements had been completed yesterday at\r\nthe registry and the chapel, the union to become legal and effective\r\nat noon on this day. When Hollis Jamison walked through their door at\r\ntwelve o\'clock he would bring four gold rings, and the moment the rings\r\nwere placed on the proper fingers the ceremony was complete.\r\n\r\nDoris said, "Let\'s steal just a tiny whiff of the perfume. I\'m too\r\ncurious to wait.

"\r\n\r\nJune and Polly were game, but Sue cut them off. "Not on your life! I\r\nused to know a chemist at the hormone labs where they compound this\r\nstuff, and he told me about it. We have things to do, and if what he\r\ntold me is true--well, it\'s very distracting."\r\n\r\nPolly backed her up, "I hear it is terribly volatile. I guess we\r\nwouldn\'t want it to wear off before Hollis came."\r\n\r\n"Hollis!" The thought was June\'s, and it came thin and quavery.\r\n"What--do you suppose it\'s like to be married?"\r\n\r\nNo one answered, for there was no experience among them. Each had\r\nher own romantic idea, so cherished, so private that even within the\r\nintimacy of their clique it was too sacred to discuss.\r\n\r\nSuddenly June said, "I\'m scared."\r\n\r\nThe thought had come sharply and unexpectedly. It was contagious. Polly\r\nsaid, "Me, too.

"\r\n\r\n"Of what?" Doris asked, "Of drinking strong coffee the rest of your\r\nlives?"\r\n\r\nIt was a weak, nervous stab at humor, and Sue knew that Doris was as\r\njumpy as the rest of them. "Steady, gals," she said sympathetically.\r\n"It\'ll be worth it. We want a baby, don\'t we?"\r\n\r\nIt was the right thought at the right time. Sue felt their minds relax,\r\nand the thought even did her some good. A sweet, little, round, pink\r\nbaby--\r\n\r\nShe let the mental picture flow out to the others, and the little\r\ncrisis passed.\r\n\r\nThe minutes flew, and soon it was five minutes to twelve. "Have we\r\nforgotten anything?" Sue asked.\r\n\r\n"The perfume!" Polly and June said together.\r\n\r\n"Hurry!" Doris said. "I think he\'s coming."\r\n\r\nThe seal on the tiny vial was broken, one drop on each breast, and the\r\nrich, exotic fumes exuded a gentle, warm excitement that was entirely\r\ndifferent from the innocent scents they had known.\r\n\r\nThe door was unlocked, and now it opened.\r\n\r\nHollis stepped in, bronzed body bared to the waist.\r\n\r\n"The flowers!" Polly wailed inwardly. "We forgot the orchids--"\r\n\r\nBut Hollis Jamison didn\'t notice the discrepancy. He advanced smiling\r\nfrom his gray eyes and strong mouth. Sue opened her lips and her fine,\r\nwhite teeth showed a welcoming smile. She was proud of her lovely body,\r\nand June, Polly and Doris shared in that pride.\r\n\r\nSue held out her left hand with fingers outstretched. Her man came\r\nforward jingling the four rings in his right hand. He paused before\r\nher, drew her left hand to his lips, kissed the little finger and slid\r\nthe proper ring on it, then, in order he kissed Sue\'s other three\r\nfingers and banded them with the remaining rings, symbolic of the four\r\nseparate feminine entities who dwelt in this one magnificent body.\r\n\r\nAnd with each ring he said a name: "June, Polly, Doris, Sue--"\r\n\r\nHe straightened and gazed into the two blue eyes.\r\n\r\n"I thee wed," he said simply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
