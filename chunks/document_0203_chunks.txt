=== Chunk 2 ===
But I knew we were within\r\nforty or fifty miles of the Trans-Space base. I had counted the miles on\r\nthis particular trip because of the load of radium we were carrying from\r\nthe Venusian mines. I wouldn\'t draw a completely relieved breath until\r\nwe were down and the stuff was in the hands of the commerce agents.\r\n\r\nI eased my position slightly to relieve the pressure on my broken\r\nflipper and grinned at the pilot, Lucky Larson, the screwiest, most\r\nunpredictable void trotter who had ever flown for dear old Trans-Space.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve been too good to be true this trip," I said, "and it\'s a good\r\nthing. The chief told me that if you so much as _thought_ about clowning\r\naround or stunting he was going to clip your wings for good."\r\n\r\nLucky grinned, an impish, devil-may-care grin that lightened up his\r\nfreckled face and bunched the tiny wrinkles at the corners of his eyes.\r\nThen with characteristic abruptness he scowled.\r\n\r\n"That grandmother," he said disgustedly. "Who does he think I am,\r\nanyway? Some crazy irresponsible madman who hasn\'t got enough brains to\r\nstay on a space beam?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s just what he does think," I grinned, "and you\'ve given him\r\nplenty of reason to think it. You can\'t bring your crate in to the base\r\nwithout stunting around and showing off and risking your damn neck.\r\nThat\'s why he sent me along with you this trip. Just to see that you\r\nact like a pilot--instead of circus acrobat."\r\n\r\n"A lot of good you\'d do," Lucky mumbled. "You got a broken arm. The only\r\nreason he sent you is because he didn\'t want to pay you while you was in\r\nthe hospital so he cooks up this trip to get his money out of you. And\r\nsay," he turned to me belligerently, "when did I ever crack up a ship?\r\nWhen did I ever even dent one of the babies?"\r\n\r\n"You haven\'t," I was forced to admit, "but that\'s just because of that\r\nscrewy luck of yours. But it won\'t last forever and one of these days\r\nit\'s going to run out just when you need it. So just remember--no\r\nstunting this trip or you\'ll be out of the strata for the rest of your\r\nnatural life."\r\n\r\n"Aw, that\'s the trouble with this racket," Lucky grumbled, "a guy can\'t\r\nhave no fun no more. Back when I was with the Space circus--"\r\n\r\n"Okay, okay," I cut in, "I\'ve heard that before. Just fly your ship,\r\nnow, and forget about the deep dark plot of the company to take all the\r\njoy out of your life. I\'m going to take a look-see at the atomic floats\r\nand get the passengers bundled together."\r\n\r\nI stood up and crawled over him and opened the door leading to the body\r\nof the ship. I could still hear him grumbling as I slid the light\r\nchrome-alloy door shut. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
I chuckled to myself and headed up the aisle to\r\nthe baggage compartments. Lucky Larson was a legend as space pilots go.\r\nAn unpredictable, erratic screwball but one of the finest rocket riders\r\nwho ever flashed through the void.\r\n\r\nCompany regulations and interplanetary commissions were the bane of his\r\nexistence. He made his own rules and regulations and got by with it.\r\nThat is he _had_ gotten by with it. Now they were cracking down on him.\r\nHe had been grounded twice and the chief had threatened to set him down\r\nfor life if any more infractions were charged to him. I shook my head\r\ngloomily. He was a great guy, the last of a great and gallant army of\r\nspace adventurers, but he was on the way out. The rules were necessary,\r\nvital to safe space travel and the Lucky Larsons would have to live up\r\nto them, or else.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy mind was a long way away from the cabin of the space ship and maybe\r\nthat\'s why I got what I did. I didn\'t see it coming. One minute I was\r\nwalking through the aisle, thinking about Lucky Larson and the next\r\nsecond something slammed into the back of my head knocking me to my\r\nknees.\r\n\r\nThrough a haze of red and white lights I heard a voice bark, "Toss him\r\ninto a chair and grab that good arm of his."\r\n\r\nI wasn\'t out. Just damn sick. Something like a cold hand seemed to have\r\nclosed over my stomach and for an awful moment I gagged and tried to\r\nretch. But the moment passed and I forced open my eyes and focused them\r\non two tough-looking, hard-eyed gents who stood in front of me. Another\r\nunpleasant-looking little man knelt along side of me, twisting my good\r\narm behind my back.\r\n\r\n"Okay," I gritted, "what\'s the gag?"\r\n\r\nThe tallest of the three, evidently their leader, smiled at me. "It\'s no\r\ngag," he murmured calmly, "we happen to need the radium you\'re carrying.\r\nWe\'re going to take it. Any objections?"\r\n\r\n"You\'ll never get away with this," I snapped, "your names and\r\ndescriptions are registered with the passenger office. You\'ll be tracked\r\ndown in twenty-four hours."\r\n\r\nI was bluffing, of course, and I knew from their contemptuous smiles\r\nthat they knew it, too. They probably had given fictitious names, and\r\nthe descriptive information which the bureau required consisted of a few\r\ngeneralities, such as height, weight and the like. I cursed myself for a\r\nstupid, careless fool. The three men had been the only passengers from\r\nVenus and they had kept to themselves the entire trip. Once or twice I\r\nhad wondered at their reticence and quietness but I had not been\r\nsuspicious enough to make a check-up.\r\n\r\nOne of the men laughed shortly. "Let us worry about that. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
We\'ve covered\r\nevery angle that could possibly come up. With the help of your friend up\r\nfront, this ship will be flown to a certain deserted asteroid where a\r\nfew friends of _ours_ are to meet us with another ship. How you come out\r\nafterward will depend on how you co-operate now. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Clear enough?

=== Chunk 6 ===
"\r\n\r\nIt was clear enough all right. Lucky and I wouldn\'t last long after we\r\nserved our purpose.\r\n\r\nThe tall man turned from me and nodded significantly to the man standing\r\nnext to him and then pointed to the closed door to the pilot\'s chambers.\r\n\r\n"Take care of the pilot," he murmured, "and tell him if he isn\'t\r\nobliging we\'ll take the cast off his friend\'s arm and--" he smiled at\r\nme, "massage it a bit."\r\n\r\nI felt a cold sweat break out on my forehead.\r\n\r\nThe thug grinned wolfishly at me and then winked at his leader. "I\'ll\r\ntell him, boss." He dug his hand into his pocket and drew out a stubby\r\natomic pistol. "If he won\'t listen to me maybe this\'ll persuade him."\r\n\r\nStill grinning he turned and headed up the aisle, the gun clenched in\r\nhis huge fist.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI glanced at the tall figure standing in front of me and saw that he was\r\nwatching the retreating figure of his henchman with a saturnine smile on\r\nhis face. I thought swiftly. If I could yell a warning to Lucky, he\r\ncould bolt the door of the pilot\'s chamber and then set the ship down at\r\nthe Trans-Space base. It was the only way to save Lucky and the radium.\r\nI wasn\'t very optimistic about my own chances. I knew they were zero.\r\n\r\nI opened my mouth, took a deep breath and then, before I could scream\r\nthe words that would warn Lucky, it happened. The ship shuddered for an\r\ninstant and then zoomed upward, the smooth hum of the rocket motors\r\ncrescendoing to a roaring song of power and speed.\r\n\r\nThe sudden jolting acceleration hurled me to the tail of the ship and I\r\nsaw, like an image in a kaleidoscope, the tangled thrashing figures of\r\nthe space bandits as they were tossed to the floor, a dazedly struggling\r\nmass of arms and legs.\r\n\r\nThe ship was lying over on its back in a few seconds, and before I could\r\ncatch a breath it suddenly whipped over and blasted toward Earth in a\r\nscreeching, hissing power-dive.\r\n\r\nIt was terrific punishment even for this type of space crate but it was\r\nworse for human beings. The three bandits were clutching at their\r\nstomachs as if they were afraid of losing them. Their faces were mottled\r\nand blotchy and their eyes were rolling beseechingly.\r\n\r\nI didn\'t mind the erratic convolutions the ship was making but my arm\r\nwas burning as if it were on fire. Numbing waves of pain were coursing\r\nup and down my entire body.\r\n\r\nI tried to crawl to my knees but the floor rolled under me as the ship\r\nwhipped over in a twisting spiral and I crashed forward on my face. Then\r\neverything dissolved into inky blackness....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen I came to, I heard a great commotion, then a sudden shot and then a\r\nbabble of voices booming around me. I remember thinking fleetingly of\r\ncrooks, Lucky Larson and a mountain of radium and then--because nothing\r\nmade sense--I passed out again.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next time I opened my eyes I found myself stretched out on a cot in\r\nthe chief\'s office. I turned my head slightly and saw Lucky Larson, the\r\nchief and a half dozen other guys staring down at me.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not very original," I said, "but where the hell am I?" That was\r\nsilly of me because I knew where I was, so I said: "Never mind that but\r\nplease tell me what the hell happened?"\r\n\r\nThe chief laughed and Lucky Larson laughed and then they slapped each\r\nother on the back. "Don\'t worry about a thing," the chief said, "those\r\ncrooks are under lock and key and there\'s not a thing to worry about."\r\n\r\n"But how--I mean what...?" My voice trailed off. Nothing made sense.\r\n\r\n"Well," the chief broke in, "Lucky here really deserves the credit for\r\ncatching them. And I\'m not forgetting your good work either. Both of you\r\nwill receive more tangible evidence of my appreciation. But Lucky really\r\ndid the brainwork."\r\n\r\n"Awww," Lucky mumbled, "it wasn\'t much. Just a little common sense and,\r\nuh, a little luck."\r\n\r\n"It was damn fast thinking," the chief cut in belligerently, "you knew\r\nyour stunting over the base would drive me crazy. You knew I\'d get so\r\nmad I\'d call out the base police and have you thrown in when you moored.\r\nAnd when you did moor and the crooks toppled out we were right on hand\r\nto receive them. They were so weak from the shaking up you gave them\r\nthat they didn\'t have a chance.

=== Chunk 7 ===
"\r\n\r\nLucky rolled innocent eyes to the ceiling. "Sometimes," he remarked\r\npiously, "stunting has its uses."\r\n\r\n"Congratulations," I said weakly. "You certainly used your head. Caught\r\nthe chief\'s attention with your stunting and almost knocked the crooks\r\nout with it too. That\'s killing two birds with one stone, all right."\r\nThen another thought occurred to me.\r\n\r\n"How did you know I was in trouble?" I asked curiously. "How did you\r\nknow we had those crooks on board?"\r\n\r\n"Why--why," Lucky sputtered, "that was simple. I just happened to look\r\nbehind me and I saw those boys piling into you. So I did a little fast\r\nthinking and then I whipped the ship into a few maneuvers and, like the\r\nchief says, they caught his eye all right."\r\n\r\nThe chief was beaming fondly and I turned my head to hide the smile on\r\nmy lips. "So you just looked behind you," I muttered. "Well, Lucky, you\r\ncertainly are--and were."\r\n\r\nHe grinned down at me and winked. "You said it, kid."\r\n\r\nI wanted to ask him a question then, but I decided to wait until we were\r\nalone. I closed my eyes and smiled again, thinking of his expression\r\nwhen I would ask him how he had been able to look behind him and see me\r\nstruggling with those crooks, _when the door of the pilot\'s chamber was\r\nclosed all the time_....\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ January 1943.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.
