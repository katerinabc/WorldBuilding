The frenetic bustle of Denver\r\nspaceport, his ominous spiriting away through screaming hordes of\r\nspectators, left him bewildered and uneasy.\r\n\r\nAlone in the first brief privacy of his Denver Heptagon apartment, he\r\nideographed a facsimile transmission to Yrml at once. "I long for you\r\nalready," he said.

"And for the serenity of home. Earthpeople are as\r\nbarbarous and mercurial as their weather."\r\n\r\nBabelous decades of taped newsreels and video serials should have\r\nprepared him for that inconstancy, but the first-hand reality was\r\nappalling. He would gladly have returned home at once, before planetary\r\nconjunction\'s end cut him off for two interminable years, but for the\r\ninevitable stumbling-block: Earth had sent an exchange of her own, and\r\nMirrh Yahn y Cona could not back down without disgracing his planet as\r\nwell as himself.\r\n\r\n"Write often," he pleaded, in closing. "That I may take comfort in your\r\nsteadfast regard even in this simian hurlyburly."\r\n\r\nThe missive finished, he found time remaining before Ellis, of\r\nDiplomatic, arrived to switch on the multisensory projection of his\r\nlast evening with Yrml. The projection had been cubed in a Privileged\r\nCouples nook complete with real plants and hermetically sealed\r\nfountain, and near its close the two of them had sung the traditional\r\nSong of Parting from the ancient _Tchulkione Serafi_.\r\n\r\nEllis arrived all too soon, trailing an aura of Scotch, diplomatic\r\nenthusiasm and geniality.\r\n\r\n"No time to waste," Ellis said briskly. "Little enough of it before you\r\nleave us, and you\'re going to see Earth from pole to pole. The three of\r\nus begin this evening with a sample of Denver night life."\r\n\r\n"Three?"\r\n\r\n"Came early to brief you," Ellis said.

"Found a guide for you. Can\'t\r\nrun about unescorted, you know."\r\n\r\nHe answered the door buzzer and admitted a young woman in evening\r\ndress. Rushed from the spaceport in what amounted to cloak-and-dagger\r\nsecrecy, Mirrh Yahn y Cona had until now seen Earthwomen only on video\r\nand at indistinguishable distance, and the sudden appearance of this\r\none in the flesh unnerved him completely.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe girl was small and slender, well under Mirrh Yahn y Cona\'s athletic\r\nsix-foot height. She was warmly and roundly vital with a stunning\r\nabundance of life at which the two-dimensional simulacra of recorded\r\nsoap-opera could only hint.\r\n\r\n"Miss Leila Anderson," Ellis introduced her. "Member of Diplomatic, so\r\nit\'s all in the family."\r\n\r\nShe took the hand that Mirrh Yahn y Cona raised as if to defend himself.\r\n\r\n"I\'m to see that you aren\'t bored to death here among strangers," she\r\nsaid. "All work and no play isn\'t good for anyone. Especially," she\r\nsaid to Ellis, "for one so handsome. I didn\'t dream he\'d look so--"\r\n\r\n"So Terran," Ellis finished before she could say _so human_. "And why\r\nnot? 

=== Chunk 4 ===
We\'re from the same original stock, separated ages before our\r\nhistory begins. Martian annals run back for millennia, did you know?\r\nGold mine of information, settle problems our experts have puzzled over\r\nfor centuries."\r\n\r\n"I am not truly representative of my people," Mirrh Yahn y Cona said\r\nwith some bitterness. "A special case, reared from birth for this\r\nassignment."\r\n\r\nThe multisensory projector swung into the _Tchulkione Serafi\'s_ Song of\r\nParting. Mirrh Yahn y Cona\'s resonant baritone, operatically assertive\r\nabove Yrml\'s reedy soprano, filled the room. He shut off the machine\r\nabruptly, feeling a sense of desecration that the tender scene had been\r\nbared to alien eyes.\r\n\r\nStill he felt a puzzling premonitory twinge of guilt when the\r\nprojection collapsed. Yrml had been infinitely desirable when the\r\nsequence was cubed; why should she now seem so sallow and angular, so\r\nsuddenly and subtly distant?\r\n\r\n"Remarkable voice," Ellis said. "You could make a fortune with it\r\nhere."\r\n\r\n"It was lovely," Leila Anderson said. "Could I hear the rest of it some\r\ntime?"\r\n\r\n"No." He realized his curtness and added, "It is the Song of Parting\r\nfor lovers. Very personal."\r\n\r\nHe found that he was still holding Leila\'s hand, and dropped it\r\nhastily. Ellis, who had risen high in Diplomatic for good reasons,\r\nstepped competently into the breach.\r\n\r\n"Night duty calls," Ellis said. "Let\'s be off."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA diplomatic limousine without insignia took them to a nightclub large\r\nenough, and dim enough, to promise anonymity. On the way a quick summer\r\nshower left the streets wet and glistening and turned the night into a\r\nmany-scented freshness that was sheer fantasy to one accustomed to the\r\nsterile air of sealed underground ways.\r\n\r\nThe rain had ended when they left the car, but the brief moment\r\noutside, under a vast openness of night sky empty except for dispersing\r\nclouds and speeding white moon, struck Mirrh Yahn y Cona suddenly cold\r\nwith too-familiar panic.\r\n\r\nThey had found their table before anyone spoke.\r\n\r\n"Agoraphobia?" Ellis said, in frowning concern. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
"I should think you\'d\r\nbe conditioned against that, with all the time they\'ve had to prepare\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nLeila Anderson put an impulsive hand on the Martian\'s.\r\n\r\n"I\'m a touch claustrophobic, so I know how it must be." She shivered.\r\n"To be buried under all those tons and tons of--"\r\n\r\n"Immurement is security," Mirrh Yahn y Cona said. "The ultimate\r\nstability."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll get acclimatized," Ellis said. "It takes time."\r\n\r\nHe broke off to peer through the gloom beyond the dance floor. "Good\r\nLord, there\'s Ryerson of the _Post_, camera and all. If he recognizes\r\nme he\'ll know who Mirrh is and--"\r\n\r\n"Yahn," Mirrh Yahn y Cona corrected automatically. "With us the second\r\nname is impersonal. First is used only by loved ones."\r\n\r\n"Yahn, then," Ellis said. "If Ryerson tumbles, he\'ll want pictures and\r\nan interview. Yahn will be lionized before he\'s ready. Can\'t publicize\r\nhim until he knows the ropes."\r\n\r\n"You\'d better skip," Leila said. "If we all go, he\'ll spot us for sure."\r\n\r\n"Right." Ellis shoved some money at Leila. "Call me at my office when\r\nit\'s safe."\r\n\r\nWhen Ellis had gone and their waiter had brought drinks, they faced\r\neach other across the table, Yahn visibly on guard and Leila with the\r\nbeginning of speculation in her eyes.\r\n\r\n"Maybe it\'s better like this, without protocol," she said. "Yahn, can\r\nyou--do you dance in our gravity?"\r\n\r\nHe was bitter again. "Remember my training. I am taller, stronger and\r\nmore freakishly agile than any Martian--including my fiancee--has been\r\nfor thousands of years."\r\n\r\nHer clear look made him ashamed and he added, "With us the dance is an\r\nart form only. Here the intent seems different."\r\n\r\n"It is," Leila said almost grimly. "Finish your drink, Buster. You\'re\r\ngoing to need it.

"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe needed several before the evening was finished. The Terran dance in\r\nits limited variations offered small challenge; Yahn mastered it with\r\nan ease that delighted Leila and brought tacit envy from other couples.\r\nThe cocktails may have contributed to his own mixed reactions, lending\r\nprimitive tactility to Leila\'s pliant response.\r\n\r\nNeither of them, when Ryerson of the _Post_ went away with his camera,\r\nconsidered calling Ellis.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t often enjoy my work so much," Leila said. "Let\'s not spoil the\r\nevening with diplomacy, shall we?"\r\n\r\nThey left the Diplomatic vehicle for Ellis, rented an agency car and\r\ndrove through the charged serenity of the night into the mountains.\r\nThey talked the Moon down and the Sun up. Nothing took place that might\r\nhave shocked a reasonably tolerant duenna, but by dawn they had reached\r\nthe sort of understanding that comes spontaneously or not at all.\r\n\r\n"The biologists who tailored me to Terrestrial standards," Yahn said,\r\n"did their work too well. I find myself more Terran than Martian."\r\n\r\nThe immovable obstacle, of course, was Yahn\'s obligation to Yrml,\r\nwho would be waiting with enduring Martian patience for his return.\r\nLeila went into that matter later with Ellis, not so much to enlist\r\nhis dubious sympathies as to clarify the bristly problem in her own\r\ntroubled mind.\r\n\r\n"Martians use our broadcasts as a standard of judgment," Leila said.\r\n"And you know where _that_ leads. The more prominent the people in\r\nthe newscasts, the higher the divorce rate. The more popular a video\r\nserial, the greater its emotional shilly-shallying. To Martians we\'re\r\nthe last word in fickleness."\r\n\r\n"I know," Ellis agreed. "Our cultural geometry was always triangular."\r\n\r\n"Exactly. So how can Mirrh-Yahn break the news to his dry little\r\nfiancee back home? We\'re accustomed to inconstancy and to incontinence.\r\nWe sing corny songs about girls who write jilting letters to their men\r\nin service. Our opera flaunts Perkinses and Mesdames Butterfly, and\r\nthe fact that we enjoy them shocks the ascetic pants off the Martians.\r\nDid you know that their population control quota demands a strictly\r\nequal sex-ratio, so that there\'s never more than one boy for one girl\r\nfrom the beginning? Mirrh-Yahn simply hasn\'t it in him to leave Yrml\r\ndangling. He\'d feel a renegade for the rest of his life."\r\n\r\n"_Mirrh_-Yahn," Ellis noted. "Obviously he\'s willing enough, if you\'re\r\non a first-name footing."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t call him Yahn any longer, like a stranger. Mirrh-Yahn is a\r\ncompromise."\r\n\r\nEllis rummaged in his desk and brought out a personnel folder. "Dossier\r\non J. Frederic Thomas, our young man on Mars. Maybe we can turn up an\r\nangle through him."\r\n\r\nThe exchange ambassador\'s folder was neither interesting nor helpful.\r\nJ. Frederic Thomas stood revealed as a dwarfish scholastic type,\r\ncomplete with massive glasses and receding hairline.\r\n\r\n"He looks more Martian than Terran," Leila said. "Is that deliberate?"\r\n\r\n"Mars sent us a man specially bred to fit into our culture, didn\'t\r\nthey? Simple job here to turn up a Martian type. Matter of fact, J.\r\nF.\'s reports show he fits in up there like a native."\r\n\r\n"Check with him, then," Leila said. "Though I can\'t imagine what help\r\nwe can expect from a wizened little stick like that."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLeila was wrong. J. Frederic Thomas--who quite predictably, being\r\npaired off with the only unattached female on Mars as his cicerone,\r\nhad immediately found himself caught in the same thorny dilemma that\r\ngouged his opposite number on Earth--was eager to help. The result of\r\nEllis\' inquiry was a swift letter from Yrml Orise y Yrl to Mirrh Yahn\r\ny Cona; a letter which Ellis turned over in duplicate, one in Martian\r\nideograph, the other a translation, to Leila.\r\n\r\nIt broke Yrml\'s engagement to Yahn for the excellent reasons that J.\r\nFrederic Thomas was not only more Martian in physique and deportment,\r\nbut also possessed a fine reedy tenor which blended ever so better with\r\nYrml\'s soprano in the less poignant duets from the _Tchulkione Serafi_.\r\n\r\n"The man never lived," Ellis pointed out, "Martian or Terran, no matter\r\nhow relieved he might be, whose ego wouldn\'t need attention after a\r\nletter beginning _Dear Yahn_. Shall I let it go on through the mails,\r\nor will you--"\r\n\r\nLeila answered him on her way out.

"Don\'t bother," she said.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
