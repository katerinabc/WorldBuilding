YOUNG\r\n\r\n\r\n _A touching story of the most\r\n enduring love in all eternity._\r\n\r\n\r\nThat night her son was the first star.\r\n\r\nShe stood motionless in the garden, one hand pressed against her heart,\r\nwatching him rise above the fields where he had played as a boy, where\r\nhe had worked as a young man; and she wondered whether he was thinking\r\nof those fields now, whether he was thinking of her standing alone in\r\nthe April night with her memories; whether he was thinking of the\r\nverandahed house behind her, with its empty rooms and silent halls, that\r\nonce upon a time had been his birthplace.\r\n\r\nHigher still and higher he rose in the southern sky, and then, when he\r\nhad reached his zenith, he dropped swiftly down past the dark edge of\r\nthe Earth and disappeared from sight. A boy grown up too soon, riding\r\nround and round the world on a celestial carousel, encased in an\r\nairtight metal capsule in an airtight metal chariot ...\r\n\r\n_Why don\'t they leave the stars alone?_ she thought. _Why don\'t they\r\nleave the stars to God?_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe general\'s second telegram came early the next morning: Explorer XII\r\n_doing splendidly. Expect to bring your son down sometime tomorrow_.\r\n\r\nShe went about her work as usual, collecting the eggs and allocating\r\nthem in their cardboard boxes, then setting off in the station wagon on\r\nher Tuesday morning run. She had expected a deluge of questions from her\r\ncustomers. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
She was not disappointed. "Is Terry really way up there all\r\nalone, Martha?" "Aren\'t you _scared_, Martha?" "I do hope they can get\r\nhim back down all right, Martha." She supposed it must have given them\r\nquite a turn to have their egg woman change into a star mother\r\novernight.\r\n\r\nShe hadn\'t expected the TV interview, though, and she would have avoided\r\nit if it had been politely possible. But what could she do when the line\r\nof cars and trucks pulled into the drive and the technicians got out and\r\nstarted setting up their equipment in the backyard? What could she say\r\nwhen the suave young man came up to her and said, "We want you to know\r\nthat we\'re all very proud of your boy up there, ma\'am, and we hope\r\nyou\'ll do us the honor of answering a few questions."\r\n\r\nMost of the questions concerned Terry, as was fitting. From the way the\r\nsuave young man asked them, though, she got the impression that he was\r\ntrying to prove that her son was just like any other average American\r\nboy, and such just didn\'t happen to be the case. But whenever she opened\r\nher mouth to mention, say, how he used to study till all hours of the\r\nnight, or how difficult it had been for him to make friends because of\r\nhis shyness, or the fact that he had never gone out for\r\nfootball--whenever she started to mention any of these things, the suave\r\nyoung man was in great haste to interrupt her and to twist her words, by\r\nrequestioning, into a different meaning altogether, till Terry\'s\r\nbehavior pattern seemed to coincide with the behavior pattern which the\r\nsuave young man apparently considered the norm, but which, if followed,\r\nMartha was sure, would produce not young men bent on exploring space but\r\nyoung men bent on exploring trivia.\r\n\r\nA few of the questions concerned herself: Was Terry her only child?\r\n("Yes.") What had happened to her husband? ("He was killed in the Korean\r\nWar.") What did she think of the new law granting star mothers top\r\npriority on any and all information relating to their sons? ("I think\r\nit\'s a fine law ... It\'s too bad they couldn\'t have shown similar\r\nhumanity toward the war mothers of World War II.")\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was late in the afternoon by the time the TV crew got everything\r\nrepacked into their cars and trucks and made their departure. Martha\r\nfixed herself a light supper, then donned an old suede jacket of Terry\'s\r\nand went out into the garden to wait for the sun to go down. According\r\nto the time table the general had outlined in his first telegram,\r\nTerry\'s first Tuesday night passage wasn\'t due to occur till 9:05. But\r\nit seemed only right that she should be outside when the stars started\r\nto come out. Presently they did, and she watched them wink on, one by\r\none, in the deepening darkness of the sky. She\'d never been much of a\r\none for the stars; most of her life she\'d been much too busy on Earth to\r\nbother with things celestial. She could remember, when she was much\r\nyounger and Bill was courting her, looking up at the moon sometimes; and\r\nonce in a while, when a star fell, making a wish. But this was\r\ndifferent. It was different because now she had a personal interest in\r\nthe sky, a new affinity with its myriad inhabitants.\r\n\r\nAnd how bright they became when you kept looking at them! They seemed to\r\ncome alive, almost, pulsing brilliantly down out of the blackness of the\r\nnight ... And they were different colors, too, she noticed with a start.\r\nSome of them were blue and some were red, others were yellow ... green\r\n... orange ...\r\n\r\nIt grew cold in the April garden and she could see her breath. There was\r\na strange crispness, a strange clarity about the night, that she had\r\nnever known before ... She glanced at her watch, was astonished to see\r\nthat the hands indicated two minutes after nine. Where had the time\r\ngone? Tremulously she faced the southern horizon ... and saw her Terry\r\nappear in his shining chariot, riding up the star-pebbled path of his\r\norbit, a star in his own right, dropping swiftly now, down, down, and\r\nout of sight beyond the dark wheeling mass of the Earth ... She took a\r\ndeep, proud breath, realized that she was wildly waving her hand and let\r\nit fall slowly to her side. Make a wish! she thought, like a little\r\ngirl, and she wished him pleasant dreams and a safe return and wrapped\r\nthe wish in all her love and cast it starward.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSometime tomorrow, the general\'s telegram had said--\r\n\r\nThat meant sometime today!\r\n\r\nShe rose with the sun and fed the chickens, fixed and ate her breakfast,\r\ncollected the eggs and put them in their cardboard boxes, then started\r\nout on her Wednesday morning run. "My land, Martha, I don\'t see how you\r\nstand it with him way up there! 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Doesn\'t it get on your _nerves_?" ("Yes\r\n... Yes, it does.") "Martha, when are they bringing him back down?"\r\n("Today ... 

=== Chunk 4 ===
_Today_!") "It must be wonderful being a star mother,\r\nMartha." ("Yes, it is--in a way.")\r\n\r\nWonderful ... and terrible.\r\n\r\nIf only he can last it out for a few more hours, she thought. If only\r\nthey can bring him down safe and sound. Then the vigil will be over, and\r\nsome other mother can take over the awesome responsibility of having a\r\nson become a star--\r\n\r\nIf only ...\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe general\'s third telegram arrived that afternoon: _Regret to inform\r\nyou that meteorite impact on satellite hull severely damaged\r\ncapsule-detachment mechanism, making ejection impossible. Will make\r\nevery effort to find another means of accomplishing your son\'s return._\r\n\r\nTerry!--\r\n\r\nSee the little boy playing beneath the maple tree, moving his tiny cars\r\nup and down the tiny streets of his make-believe village; the little\r\nboy, his fuzz of hair gold in the sunlight, his cherub-cheeks pink in\r\nthe summer wind--\r\n\r\n_Terry!--_\r\n\r\nUp the lane the blue-denimed young man walks, swinging his thin tanned\r\narms, his long legs making near-grownup strides over the sun-seared\r\ngrass; the sky blue and bright behind him, the song of cicada rising and\r\nfalling in the hazy September air--\r\n\r\n_Terry ..._\r\n\r\n_--probably won\'t get a chance to write you again before take-off, but\r\ndon\'t worry, Ma. The _Explorer XII_ is the greatest bird they ever\r\nbuilt. Nothing short of a direct meteorite hit can hurt it, and the odds\r\nare a million to one ..._\r\n\r\n_Why don\'t they leave the stars alone? Why don\'t they leave the stars to\r\nGod?_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe afternoon shadows lengthened on the lawn and the sun grew red and\r\nswollen over the western hills. Martha fixed supper, tried to eat, and\r\ncouldn\'t. After a while, when the light began to fade, she slipped into\r\nTerry\'s jacket and went outside.\r\n\r\nSlowly the sky darkened and the stars began to appear. At length _her_\r\nstar appeared, but its swift passage blurred before her eyes. Tires\r\ncrunched on the gravel then, and headlights washed the darkness from the\r\ndrive. A car door slammed.\r\n\r\nMartha did not move. _Please God_, she thought, _let it be Terry_, even\r\nthough she knew that it couldn\'t possibly be Terry. Footsteps sounded\r\nbehind her, paused. Someone coughed softly. She turned then--\r\n\r\n"Good evening, ma\'am."\r\n\r\nShe saw the circlet of stars on the gray epaulet; she saw the stern\r\nhandsome face; she saw the dark tired eyes. And she knew. Even before he\r\nspoke again, she knew--\r\n\r\n"The same meteorite that damaged the ejection mechanism, ma\'am. It\r\npenetrated the capsule, too. We didn\'t find out till just a while\r\nago--but there was nothing we could have done anyway ... Are you all\r\nright, ma\'am?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. I\'m all right."\r\n\r\n"I wanted to express my regrets personally. I know how you must feel.

=== Chunk 5 ===
"\r\n\r\n"It\'s all right."\r\n\r\n"We will, of course, make every effort to bring back his ... remains ...\r\nso that he can have a fitting burial on Earth."\r\n\r\n"No," she said.\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon, ma\'am?"\r\n\r\nShe raised her eyes to the patch of sky where her son had passed in his\r\nshining metal sarcophagus. Sirius blossomed there, blue-white and\r\nbeautiful. She raised her eyes still higher--and beheld the vast\r\nparterre of Orion with its central motif of vivid forget-me-nots, its\r\nfar-flung blooms of Betelguese and Rigel, of Bellatrix and Saiph ... And\r\nhigher yet--and there flamed the exquisite flower beds of Taurus and\r\nGemini, there burgeoned the riotous wreath of the Crab; there lay the\r\npulsing petals of the Pleiades ... And down the ecliptic garden path,\r\nwafted by a stellar breeze, drifted the ocher rose of Mars ...\r\n\r\n"No," she said again.\r\n\r\nThe general had raised his eyes, too; now, slowly, he lowered them. "I\r\nthink I understand, ma\'am. And I\'m glad that\'s the way you want it ...\r\nThe stars _are_ beautiful tonight, aren\'t they."\r\n\r\n"More beautiful than they\'ve ever been," she said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter the general had gone, she looked up once more at the vast and\r\nvariegated garden of the sky where her son lay buried, then she turned\r\nand walked slowly back to the memoried house.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ January 1959.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.
