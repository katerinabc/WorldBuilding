If it\'s not\r\n    a new wrinkle in nuclear fission, it\'s a gun to shoot around corners\r\n    and down winding staircases. Or maybe a nice new strain of bacteria\r\n    guaranteed to give you radio-active dandruff. Our own suggestion is\r\n    to pipe a few of our television commercials into Russia and bore the\r\n    enemy to death._\r\n\r\n    _Well, it seems that Ivar Jorgensen has hit on the ultimate engine\r\n    of destruction: a weapon designed to exploit man\'s greatest\r\n    weakness. The blueprint can be found in the next few pages; and as\r\n    the soldier in the story says, our only hope is to keep a sense of\r\n    humor!_\r\n\r\n\r\nMe? I\'m looking for my outfit. Got cut off in that Holland Tunnel\r\nattack. Mind if I sit down with you guys a while? Thanks. Coffee? Damn!\r\nThis is heaven. Ain\'t seen a cup of coffee in a year.\r\n\r\nWhat? You said it! This sure is a hell of a war. Tough on a guy\'s feet.\r\nYeah, that\'s right. Holland Tunnel skirmish. Where the Ruskies used that\r\nnew gun. Uhuh. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
God! It was awful. Guys popping off all around a guy and\r\nhim not knowing why. No sense to it. No noise. No wound. Just popping\r\noff.\r\n\r\nThat\'s the trouble with this war. It won\'t settle down to a routine.\r\nAlways something new. What the hell chance has a guy got to figure\r\nthings out? And I tell you them Ruskies are coming up with new weapons\r\njust as fast as we are. Enough to make your hair stand on end.\r\n\r\nSugar? 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Christ, yes! Ain\'t seen sugar for a year. You see, it\'s like\r\nthis: we were bottled up in the pits around the Tunnel for seven damn\r\ndays. It was like nothing you ever saw before. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Oops--sorry. Didn\'t mean\r\nto splash you. I was laughing about something that happened there--to a\r\nguy. Maybe you guys would get a kick out of it. After all, we got to\r\nkeep our sense of humor.\r\n\r\nYou see, there was me and a Kentucky kid named Stillwell in this pit--a\r\npretty big pit with lots of room--and we were all alone. This Stillwell\r\nwas a nice kid--green and lonesome and it\'s pretty sad, really, but\r\nthere\'s a yak in it, and--as I say--we got to keep a sense of humor.\r\n\r\nWell, this Stillwell--a really green kid--is unhappy and just plain\r\ndrooling for his gal back home. He talks about his mother, of course,\r\nand his old man, but it\'s the girl that\'s really on his mind as you guys\r\ncan plainly understand.\r\n\r\nHe\'s seeing her every place--like spots in front of his eyes--nice spots\r\ndoing things to him, when this Ruskie babe shows up.\r\n\r\nMy gun came up without any orders from me just as she poked her puss\r\nover the edge of the pit, and--huh? Oh, thank you kindly. It sure tastes\r\ngood but I don\'t want to short you guys. Thank you kindly.\r\n\r\nWell, as I was saying, this Ruskie babe pokes her nose over the edge of\r\nthe pit and Stillwell dives and knocks down my gun. He says, "You\r\nson-of-a-bitch!" Just like that. Wild and desperate, like you\'d say to a\r\nguy if the guy was just kicking over the last jug of water on a desert\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nIt would have been long enough for her to kill us if I hadn\'t had good\r\nreflexes. Even then, all I had time to do was knock the pistol out of\r\nher hand and drag her into the pit.\r\n\r\nWith her play bollixed, she was confused and bewildered. She ain\'t a\r\nfighter, and she sits back against the wall staring at us dead pan with\r\nbig expressionless eyes. She\'s a plenty pretty babe and I could see\r\nexactly what had happened as far as Stillwell was concerned. His spots\r\nhad come to life in very adequate form so to speak.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nStillwell goes over and sits down beside her and I\'m very much on the\r\nalert, because I know where his courage comes from. But I decide it\'s\r\nall right, because I see the babe is not belligerent, just confused kind\r\nof. And friendly.\r\n\r\nAnd willing. Kind of a whipped-little-dog willing, and man oh man! She\r\nwas sure what Stillwell needed.\r\n\r\nThey kind of went together like a hand and a glove--natural-like. And\r\nit followed--pretty natural--that when Stillwell got up and led her\r\naround a wing of the pit, out of sight, she went willing--like that same\r\nlittle dog.\r\n\r\nUhuh. No, you guys. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Two\'s enough. I wouldn\'t rob you. Well, okay, and\r\nthanks kindly.\r\n\r\nWell, there I was, all alone, but happy for Stillwell, cause I know it\'s\r\nwhat the kid needs, and in spots like that what difference does it make?\r\nYank--Ruskie--Mongolian--as long as she\'s willing.\r\n\r\nThen, you guys, Stillwell comes back out--wall-eyed--real\r\nwall-eyed--like being hit but not knocked out and still walking. I know\r\nwhat it is--some kind of shock. I get up and walk over and take a look\r\nat the babe where he\'d left her--and I bust out laughing. I told you\r\nguys there was a yak in this. I laughed like a fool--it was that funny.\r\nAs much as I had time to, before Stillwell cracked. It was enough to\r\ncrack him--the little thing that pushes a guy over the edge.\r\n\r\nHe lets out a yell and screams, "For crisake! For crisake! Nothing but a\r\nbucket of bolts! Nothing but a couple of plastic lumps--"\r\n\r\nThat was when I hit him. I had to. He was for the birds, Stillwell was.\r\nAn hour later we got relieved and a couple of medicos carried him away\r\nstrapped to a stretcher--gone like a kite.\r\n\r\nThey took the robot too, and its clothes, but they forgot the brassiere,\r\nso I took it and I been carrying it ever since, but I\'ll leave it with\r\nyou guys if you want--for the coffee. Might make you think about home.\r\nAfter all, like the man says, we got to keep our sense of humor.\r\n\r\nWell, so long, you guys--and thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ April-May 1953.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.
