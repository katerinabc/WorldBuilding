I was blind, I was choking, I was mangled\r\nby the pressure. All I could think was that I had to get up and out, up\r\nand out.\r\n\r\nMy sleep-cramped brain battled toward consciousness. The blackness\r\naround me gave way to deep violet, then gray, then a vague colorless\r\ndinginess as I rose to wakefulness. I moved my arms, tentatively,\r\nfeeling the centuries-old numbness starting to give way. _This is what\r\nit feels like to be born_, my mind said.\r\n\r\nThen, voices. Loud, strident, horribly painful to nerves that hadn\'t\r\nfelt the impact of sound in five hundred years. A kind of terror ran\r\nthrough me; I cringed at the thought of the unknown future into which\r\nI had so boldly plunged. It had seemed like a joke, once--but I had\r\nslept away half a millennium, and time for awakening was here.\r\n\r\nVoices. Someone shouting, "He\'s mine! I got here before you did, Sam!"\r\n\r\nAnother voice: "The hell you did, Phil. _I_ was here. You get out of\r\nhere."\r\n\r\nI shook my head foggily and stirred. Sam and Phil, whoever they were,\r\nwere making much too much noise. I wanted them to go away; I was\r\nterribly tired, wanting nothing but another few hundred years of sleep.\r\n\r\nI yawned and sat up. And gasped. For as I opened my eyes and gradually\r\nfocussed them, I saw Sam and Phil. They were having a knockdown tussle,\r\nand it was hard to tell which one was on top.\r\n\r\nBut there was one thing I could tell: they were both female. One\r\nseemed to be a magnificent brunette, wide-shouldered and fiery-eyed;\r\nthe other, a redhead, lithe and wiry. They wore only skin-tight blue\r\ntrunks; as they rolled over and over on the floor, I caught occasional\r\nglimpses of bare breasts and lovely flashing thighs.\r\n\r\nI climbed out of my somno-casket and lowered myself to the floor of the\r\nchamber, wobbling unsteadily. They ignored me, and continued to battle\r\nit out.\r\n\r\n"Hold on, girls," I said finally. "This is no way to welcome a man from\r\nthe distant past."\r\n\r\nAt my words they cut out the wrestling instantly. They clambered to\r\ntheir feet, glaring bitterly at each other, and turned to look at me.\r\n\r\nThey were really stacked. To my astonishment I discovered that they\r\nstood nearly six feet tall, both of them, with high, proud breasts and\r\ntapering, well-muscled bodies. _What a pair of amazons_, I thought\r\nadmiringly.\r\n\r\nBut they seemed to be doing some admiring too. The redhead emitted a\r\nmost feminine sigh and said, "Isn\'t he _lovely_!"\r\n\r\n"He certainly is," the brunette agreed. "Worth waiting five hundred\r\nyears for."\r\n\r\nWith sudden dismay I realized I was naked. I reddened and grabbed for a\r\ncloth that had been draped over the somno-casket, and wrapped it around\r\nmyself. I felt a little bewildered by things; I hadn\'t expected to be\r\ngreeted by a pair of half-naked amazons when I woke.\r\n\r\nThe brunette nudged the other and said, "Let\'s get out of here with him\r\nnow, Phil. We won\'t fight over him.

=== Chunk 2 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Good idea," the redhead responded. "If we keep on fighting over who\r\ngets him, Her Majesty\'ll find out he\'s awake and take him away from\r\nboth of us. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Let\'s go!"\r\n\r\nThey approached me and grabbed me firmly, one on each side. "Come on,\r\nmuscles," the one named Phil said. "Let\'s travel."\r\n\r\n"Just a second," I said. "Who are you? 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Where are you taking me?" I\r\ndidn\'t feel like trusting myself to these two till I had my bearings.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t worry about that, honey," Sam said. "We\'ll take good care of\r\nyou." She winked broadly and said, "Won\'t we, Phil?"\r\n\r\nThey started to propel me out the door of the chamber. I was still a\r\nlittle too woozy to put up much of an argument, and they were both\r\nsubstantial specimens who knew how to swing their weight around. Weak\r\nas I was, I had no choice but to let them push me into the corridor.\r\n\r\n"Where to?" Sam asked.\r\n\r\n"To the Lower Quarters," Phil said. "There\'s a copter there, and\r\nwe--oh, oh! 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Here comes trouble!"\r\n\r\nI glanced over my shoulder and saw a truly gigantic woman coming down\r\nthe corridor towards us. She looked about seven feet tall, a real\r\nmonster. She was wearing the usual trunks, plus some sort of jeweled\r\ndiadem dangling between at her bosom.\r\n\r\n"Hold up there!" she bellowed. "Where are you three going? Where\'s the\r\nguard on the Sleep Chamber?"\r\n\r\nPhil and Sam didn\'t stop to make conversation. They tightened their\r\ngrips on my arm and started to run. I dragged helplessly for a couple\r\nof steps, then got straightened away and began to run with them.\r\n\r\n"Stop! Come back!" the big woman yelled--and she came roaring after\r\nus. The floor seemed to shake as she thundered along the corridor.\r\n\r\nWe fled. I allowed myself to be dragged along by my two amazon captors,\r\nwith the third pounding away behind us. The corridor seemed to be\r\nendless.\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly it stopped being endless. There was a horde of women\r\ncoming up toward us from the other direction.\r\n\r\n"The old cow\'s called the guards," Sam muttered. "We\'re caught, now!"\r\n\r\nWe were. The tide of female guards swept over us like a herd of cattle,\r\nand abruptly I found myself in the midst of a vast heaving mass of\r\nstruggling women. At first I thought they were after Sam and Phil, who\r\nhad tried to steal me and failed--but the truth dawned only after I had\r\neluded the steel-like clutches of one powerful mademoiselle and fallen\r\nright into another\'s arms.\r\n\r\nAs she hugged me triumphantly to her surging bosom, I understood. They\r\nwere after me.\r\n\r\nMe.\r\n\r\nTwo dozen women, chasing after me. And I was still not really fully\r\nconscious from my long stay under suspended animation.\r\n\r\n_Maybe I\'m dreaming!_ I thought.\r\n\r\nNo. No dream. I was at least wide-awake enough to tell that. The women\r\nwere battling furiously; I was being shunted back and forth from one\r\nto another. I was starting to feel like a plaything. So I struck back.\r\n\r\nI landed a fist in a tough, unyielding female stomach, then splatted a\r\nhand into a pair of lovely lips. I was fighting for my life now; they\r\nwere threatening to smother me. Two of them got me down, while a third\r\ngrabbed one arm and tried to drag me away.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I heard a loud voice yell, "_Stop!_" And an instant later,\r\neverything stopped. Completely. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
None of us could move a muscle. I was\r\nlocked in the embrace of a wild-looking but rather lovely blonde, whose\r\nface was frozen in an expression of glee.\r\n\r\nOnly my eyes could move. I rolled them around and saw a woman in regal\r\npanoply stalking majestically toward us. She held a small metal weapon\r\nin her hand.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve all behaved _disgracefully_!" she said ringingly. She clicked\r\nthe weapon at us a second time and the stasis broke. The horde of women\r\npicked themselves up and stood staring sheepishly at the floor. The\r\nQueen--for her rank seemed obvious--swept imperiously toward me.\r\n\r\n"Are you the Sleeper?" she demanded.\r\n\r\n"I believe so, your majesty."\r\n\r\n"Excellent. Come to my chamber at once. The rest of you remand\r\nyourselves to the guardhouse, for punishment. Follow me, male!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs I followed her up the long corridor, I was struck by the humor of\r\nthe situation. I had volunteered for the Somno-casket project after the\r\nbustup of my engagement; feeling that there was no place for me in the\r\nworld of the twentieth century and that I wasn\'t much interested in\r\ncontinuing to live in it. I grabbed at a straw and let myself be tucked\r\naway in suspended animation, as a guinea-pig. The scientists of five\r\nhundred years from now would revive me, and I would be a living man\r\nfrom the distant past.\r\n\r\nSo I had awakened. But in the intervening five centuries, while I\r\nslumbered under my time-lock, my casket had been shifted from Professor\r\nOstrov\'s laboratory to this--this madhouse of furious amazons, and I\r\nwas now apparently playing Adam to a few dozen Eves.\r\n\r\nAnd now the queen bee herself had grabbed me off. Two guards prodded\r\nme from behind, and the Queen strutted ahead of me toward her private\r\nchambers. What waited for me there, I didn\'t know.\r\n\r\nI wasn\'t to find out, either. Because as we came to a bend in the\r\ncorridor, two men stepped out of nowhere. Men--real males.\r\n\r\nI was so astonished to see another unshaven face again that I froze and\r\nglared at them goggle-eyed. One of the men turned to me and said, "Help\r\nus! We\'re here to rescue you!"\r\n\r\nThat sounded good to me. So I took the club one of them handed me,\r\nand while they grabbed the two guards I clonked them--gently, but\r\nefficiently. The Queen finally caught on to what was happening, and\r\nturned.\r\n\r\nShe let out a howl. "Guards! 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Guards!"\r\n\r\nI shut my eyes and pictured another madhouse and another wild chase\r\nback down the corridor. But this time it didn\'t happen. The two men\r\nnodded to one side. The wall opened, and we stepped in, out of sight.\r\n\r\nInto an elevator.\r\n\r\nDown, down, down ... into the depths of the Earth, it seemed. Finally\r\nthe elevator stopped.\r\n\r\n"We get out here," one of the men said.\r\n\r\nWe were in a dank, dungeon-like place. We started up a cold, crawling\r\ncorridor, but happily turned off before we had gone too far. One of my\r\nmale escorts opened a door.\r\n\r\n"Here he is, boss."\r\n\r\nA man sat behind the desk--unshaven, naked to the waist. His face was\r\naggressively male; his bare chest was covered with a thick mat of\r\nblack hair. "My name is Lola," he said, in a rumbling basso. "Welcome\r\nto our happy land."\r\n\r\n"_Lola?_" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it a beaut? The women take men\'s names now--and we get theirs.\r\n_Lola_," he repeated, bitterly.\r\n\r\n"So that explains Phil and Sam, then."\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"Two chicks I met topside, before all the fuss began. I couldn\'t\r\nunderstand why they were named like that."\r\n\r\n"Now you do," Lola said. "Let\'s get down to business: you come from\r\n1957, don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s right. I--"\r\n\r\n"You know what it\'s like to live in a world where _men_ were supreme.\r\nRight?"\r\n\r\n"Right."\r\n\r\n"We\'re in a pretty bad fix here," Lola said. "The women grabbed control\r\nabout three hundred years ago. It started with little things like\r\nrunning for office, and now it mushroomed into _this_. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
We\'re under\r\ntheir heels! And we can\'t do a thing about it!"\r\n\r\n"Why not? Do they outnumber you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes and no," Lola said. "In terms of actual arithmetic, we\'re about\r\neven; they\'ve got a slight numerical edge, not much. But in terms\r\nof battle strength, they\'ve got us licked. Most of today\'s men are\r\nweaklings."\r\n\r\n"But you don\'t look like any milksop," I pointed out.\r\n\r\n"I\'m an exception. There\'s a pretty tight core of us, down here biding\r\nour time. We\'ve planned a rebellion against the Matriarchs. But we need\r\nyou, brother."\r\n\r\n"Me? 

=== Chunk 9 ===
What for?"\r\n\r\n"You\'ve been asleep for five hundred years--and all that time, the\r\nworld\'s been waiting for you to awaken. You\'re almost a demigod\r\nnow--you\'re a historical figure. Imagine the impact if you come to life\r\nand spearhead a rebellion against the Matriarchs! You\'ll kindle the\r\nspirits of millions of downtrodden males who wouldn\'t have dared to do\r\nany such thing unless--"\r\n\r\n"Wait a second," I said uneasily, thinking of the amazons upstairs. "I\r\ndon\'t plan to get messed up in any private quarrels of this century,\r\nfriend. Those girls look pretty tough, and I\'m not going to risk my--"\r\n\r\n"The hell you aren\'t," Lola said quietly. "We\'ve been waiting for\r\nthis day too long for you to mess it up now that you _are_ awake. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
You\r\ncooperate or else.

=== Chunk 11 ===
"\r\n\r\nI was tempted to ask what the "or else" was, but I didn\'t. There was\r\ntoo much menace hidden in Lola\'s flat voice.\r\n\r\n"You\'re going to appear suddenly in Central Plaza tonight," he told\r\nme. "You\'ll use this photonic amplifier and tell everyone who you are.\r\nIt\'ll attract a big crowd--and then you yell out, \'On to the Palace.\'\r\n\r\n"At that moment, my men appear. There are about five hundred of us, and\r\nwith them as a nucleus we recruit as many of the men in the Plaza as we\r\ncan. We storm the Palace, take over the place, and on the impetus of\r\nthat we bring the women under our dominance again."\r\n\r\nI folded my arms. "Suppose I don\'t make your speech?" I could see\r\nmyself getting assassinated, torn to pieces by wild women, or dying in\r\nany number of horrid ways.\r\n\r\nLola smiled. "Then we brainwash you and hype you up with something\r\nthat\'ll _make_ you give your speech. After that, we throw what\'s left\r\nof you away. Sound better?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll think it over," I said.\r\n\r\n"Good." He glanced at one of his brawny underlings. "Clara, lock this\r\nguy up in the keep until we\'re ready to spring things. Then start\r\ngetting the boys together, huh?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI sat alone in the dark and tried to figure things out. Somehow, the\r\nwomen had gotten the upper hand in this society, and most of the men\r\nwere reduced to mere milksops. Except for a handful of determined\r\nmusclemen, that is, who were holed up down here ready to make a last\r\nstand against feminine supremacy.\r\n\r\nInto this situation, enter me.\r\n\r\nI was just an average joe in the past, a fellow who ran into some\r\ntrouble and decided the easiest way out was to duck into this\r\nguinea-pig job. Some way out!\r\n\r\nApparently these women saw something in me--maybe there aren\'t enough\r\nmen to go around, or something, and they jumped for me. So I got away\r\nfrom them. Talk about frying pans and fires, though!\r\n\r\nI heard Clara\'s steady pacing outside my cell. They weren\'t going to\r\nlet me out until the time came for my speech. And if I delivered the\r\nspeech as instructed, some amazon was likely to nail me; if I didn\'t,\r\nLola would take care of me. I was cooked either way.\r\n\r\nI cursed myself for having left 1957 in the first place. But it was too\r\nlate to worry about that now. 

=== Chunk 12 ===
I was here, and I was going to operate\r\nunder my own steam or else.\r\n\r\nAnd no matter which way I moved, I was doomed. Even if Lola and his men\r\nwon, probably Lola\'s first action would be to put _me_ out of his way,\r\nas a possible rival for his throne. And naturally if the women held the\r\nfort they\'d waste no time slitting my throat before I fomented another\r\nrebellion.\r\n\r\nMaybe wishing wouldn\'t make it so, but I wished desperately to be back\r\nin the 20th century where I belonged. I practically yelled it out loud.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to be here!" I yelled. "I should a stayed where I was!"\r\n\r\n"Cut out that caterwauling," Clara growled. "You want the Queen to hear\r\nyou? She\'s only a hundred stories above us, y\' know."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care," I said miserably. "I\'m going to die either way, so what\r\ndoes it matter?"\r\n\r\nThen I realized the foolishness of my own attitude. I was due to face\r\ndeath; why not do it bravely? So I shut up. I waited.\r\n\r\nHours passed. Then the cell door swung open, and Lola walked in.\r\n\r\n"Ready to go make your speech, pal? Remember--all of masculine\r\nmankind\'s future depends on the pitch you make."\r\n\r\n"Okay," I said. 

=== Chunk 13 ===
"I\'ll go." But my knees were quivering, and I didn\'t\r\nreally mean it.\r\n\r\nHe handed me a small round capsule. "This is the photonic amplifier.\r\nWhen I give you the signal, just switch it on and start to talk. You\'ll\r\nbe heard all over the city."\r\n\r\n"Downtrodden males of the world, unite!" I said, grinning despite\r\nmyself. "All right, Lola. I\'ll do what I can in the name of mankind."\r\n\r\n"You\'d better," he said ominously.\r\n\r\nWhat happened after that is pretty hazy. Lola and Clara led me through\r\na fantastic passageway into the open, and conducted me to the Central\r\nPlaza. I remember making a speech of some kind. I remember three of\r\nthe amazon women racing madly toward me, trying to reach me and shut\r\nme up. I remember starting to run in the middle of my speech, turning,\r\nslugging it out with the three women. They were like pillars of stone.\r\nThey closed in on me.\r\n\r\nAnd I blanked out. Sometime later, I awoke--\r\n\r\nAnd saw the patient, kindly face of Professor Ostrov peering down at me.\r\n\r\n"What are _you_ doing here?" I demanded. "Did you suspend yourself too?\r\nAnd what\'s been going on?"\r\n\r\n"This is the year 1957, son," he said calmly. "Everything is all right."\r\n\r\n"Like hell it is," I snapped. "Where am I? What--"\r\n\r\n"You\'re in my laboratory," he said. "You\'ve been under-going\r\npreliminary psychological tests before I put you into the somno-casket.\r\nI\'ve been keeping close electroencephalographic check on you all the\r\ntime you were living through that purely fictional incident."\r\n\r\nI sat bolt upright. "You mean that never happened?"\r\n\r\n"Merely a test," he said mildly. "But I\'m happy to report that you\r\nshowed commendable adaptability in strange situations, that you handled\r\nyourself well--though we observed one momentary lapse in stability--and\r\nthat, in general--"\r\n\r\nI got off the table and silenced him. "I want to thank you, Doctor."\r\n\r\n"What for?"\r\n\r\n"For giving me a second chance," I said. I reached for my clothes and\r\nstarted getting into them. "I\'ve had one look at the future, and maybe\r\nit was a phony, but it taught me one thing--life can\'t be any worse\r\nhere."\r\n\r\n"Are you, then, planning to withdraw from the experiment?" he asked,\r\ngaping.\r\n\r\n"Damned right I am!" I smiled happily, put on my coat, and left the lab\r\nwithout a further word. I knew now that there was no sense in running\r\noff to the future; things weren\'t any simpler there.\r\n\r\nI knew what I would do: I would find my girl, take her out someplace,\r\ntalk over all our misunderstandings. I was confident we\'d patch things\r\nup somehow.\r\n\r\nAll I had to do to make our marriage work was be a little more\r\nconsiderate--and let her share the responsibilities, instead of trying\r\nto run the whole show myself. Yes, I thought, as I started down the\r\nfamiliar dirty old twentieth-century street. Women needed to be given\r\nmore responsibility in running things.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
