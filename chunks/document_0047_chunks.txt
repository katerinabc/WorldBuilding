]\r\n\r\n\r\nCoxe, an unusually phlegmatic citizen, came to buy the new refrigerator\r\nin the usual fashion. He was looking for a bargain. It was the latest\r\nmodel, fresh from the new production line in Los Angeles, and was\r\nmarked down considerably below standard. The freezing compartment held\r\n245 lbs. of meat.\r\n\r\n"How come so cheap?" Coxe wanted to know.\r\n\r\n"Frankly," the salesman said, "I asked myself that. Usually there\'s a\r\ndent in them or something, when they have that factory tag on them. But\r\nI checked it over and I can\'t find anything wrong with it. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
However,\r\nshe goes as is."\r\n\r\n"At that price," Coxe said, "I\'ll take it."\r\n\r\nIt arrived, refinished in a copper color to his specifications, the\r\nfollowing Tuesday. It was plugged in and operated perfectly. He checked\r\nit out by freezing ice cubes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWednesday evening, when he opened the door to chill some beer, there\r\nwas a package in the freezing compartment. He took out the package.\r\n\r\nIt was some sort of plastic and appeared to contain fish eggs.\r\n\r\nCoxe had not seen fresh fish eggs, considered by some a delicacy, for\r\na number of years.\r\n\r\nHe chilled the beer and fried the eggs.\r\n\r\nBoth tasted about right.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following Friday, his girl friend came over to fix dinner for him,\r\nand when she looked in the freezing compartment, she said, "What\'s\r\nthis?"\r\n\r\n"Fish eggs," Coxe said. "How many of them?"\r\n\r\n"Two packages."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll fry them up for breakfast," he said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSaturday morning, there were three packages of eggs in the refrigerator.\r\n\r\n"Where do they come from?" his girl friend wanted to know.\r\n\r\n"They just appear. I ate some and they\'re very good."\r\n\r\nShe was reluctant, but he talked her into preparing a package.\r\n\r\nShe agreed they were very good.\r\n\r\n"What are you going to do about it?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think there\'s anything to do about it," he said. "I like fish\r\neggs."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, the package they had eaten Saturday had been replaced. They\r\nwere coming in at a steady rate of one a day. Coxe cooked a package for\r\nbreakfast and took the other two to his parents.\r\n\r\nBy Tuesday, he was getting tired of the eggs, and by the end of the\r\nweek, he had four more packages. He succeeded in giving two packages to\r\nthe neighbors.\r\n\r\nAt the end of another week, he had eight packages.\r\n\r\nHe explained to his girl friend. She suggested they visit all their\r\nfriends, leaving a package with each of them.\r\n\r\nAt the end of another two weeks, this method for disposing of the eggs\r\nhad worn thin. They finally managed to give the last two packages to\r\nthe landlady.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the end of still another week, there were seven more packages.\r\nOtherwise, the refrigerator was a good buy.\r\n\r\nCoxe calculated that, at the present rate, had he left the packages in\r\nthe compartment, it would have been filled by the end of the month.\r\nHe felt that once that point was reached, the eggs would stop coming.\r\nShould this prove to be incorrect, he was prepared to arrange for some\r\nmethod of commercial distribution for the product.\r\n\r\nOn schedule, the eggs stopped coming.\r\n\r\nHe waited two days. No more came. It was over.\r\n\r\nHe ate the last package.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe refrigerator worked perfectly, and he began to stock it with things\r\nfreezers are conventionally stocked with.\r\n\r\nIt was almost two weeks after the last package had appeared, early one\r\nSunday morning, when the doorbell rang.\r\n\r\nAt the door was a small, nondescript man with a vaguely--and really\r\nindefinably--unpleasant aspect. His head was bandaged.\r\n\r\n"Mr. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Coxe?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"That\'s me."\r\n\r\n"May I come in?"\r\n\r\n"Come on."\r\n\r\nThe man seated himself. "Something terrible has happened," he said. "A\r\nhorrible mistake has been made."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry to hear that. You look as if you were in an accident."\r\n\r\n"I was. I\'ve been in the ... hospital ... for nearly two months. But\r\nto come to the point, Mr. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Coxe. I\'ve come about the refrigerator you\r\nrecently purchased. It was a special refrigerator that was erroneously\r\nshipped out of the plant as a second. When I didn\'t come in, it got\r\nshipped out and sold."\r\n\r\n"Good refrigerator," Coxe said.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you\'ve noticed ... ah ... something unusual about it?"\r\n\r\n"It runs okay. For a while there were a bunch of packages of fish eggs\r\nin it."\r\n\r\n"Fish eggs!" the little man cried in horror. After he had recovered\r\nsufficiently, he asked, "You do, of course you do, I\'m sure you still\r\nhave all the ... little packages?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," said Coxe.\r\n\r\n"NO? Oh, my God. What did you do with them, Mr. Coxe?"\r\n\r\n"Ate them."\r\n\r\n"You ... ate ... them? Ate--? No. You didn\'t. Not all of them. You\r\ncouldn\'t have done that, Mr. Coxe. Please tell me that you could not\r\nhave done that."\r\n\r\n"I had to give a lot of them away, and everybody said they were\r\ndelicious. And really.... Uh, Mr.--? Mr., uh...."\r\n\r\nThe little man got unsteadily to his feet. His face was ashen. "This is\r\nhorrible, horrible." He stumbled to the door. "You are a fiend. All our\r\nwork ... all our plans ... and you, you...." He turned to Coxe. "I hate\r\nyou. Oh, I hate you."\r\n\r\n"Now, see here."\r\n\r\n"... Mr. Coxe, you\'ll never realize the enormity of your crime. _You\'ve\r\neaten all of us!_" With that, he slammed the door and was gone.\r\n\r\nCoxe went back to the other room.\r\n\r\n"Who was it, honey?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, some nut. Seems he had first claim on the refrigerator."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll bet it was about the fish eggs."\r\n\r\n"Yeah, he wanted them.

=== Chunk 6 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear. Do you think he can do anything to us?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think so, not now. It\'s too late," Coxe concluded. "We ate\r\nthem all."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
