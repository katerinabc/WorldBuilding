Andrew North_\r\n\r\n\r\n    Under normal conditions a whole person has a decided advantage\r\n    over a handicapped one. But out in deep space the normal may\r\n    be reversed--for humans at any rate.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteena of the spaceways--that sounds just like a corny title for one of\r\nthe Stellar-Vedo spreads. I ought to know, I\'ve tried my hand at writing\r\nenough of them. Only this Steena was no glamour babe. She was as\r\ncolorless as a Lunar plant--even the hair netted down to her skull had a\r\nsort of grayish cast and I never saw her but once draped in anything but\r\na shapeless and baggy gray space-all.\r\n\r\nSteena was strictly background stuff and that is where she mostly spent\r\nher free hours--in the smelly smoky background corners of any\r\nstellar-port dive frequented by free spacers. If you really looked for\r\nher you could spot her--just sitting there listening to the\r\ntalk--listening and remembering. She didn\'t open her own mouth often.\r\nBut when she did spacers had learned to listen. And the lucky few who\r\nheard her rare spoken words--these will never forget Steena.\r\n\r\nShe drifted from port to port. Being an expert operator on the big\r\ncalculators she found jobs wherever she cared to stay for a time. And\r\nshe came to be something like the master-minded machines she\r\ntended--smooth, gray, without much personality of her own.\r\n\r\nBut it was Steena who told Bub Nelson about the Jovan moon-rites--and\r\nher warning saved Bub\'s life six months later. It was Steena who\r\nidentified the piece of stone Keene Clark was passing around a table one\r\nnight, rightly calling it unworked Slitite. That started a rush which\r\nmade ten fortunes overnight for men who were down to their last jets.\r\nAnd, last of all, she cracked the case of the _Empress of Mars_.\r\n\r\nAll the boys who had profited by her queer store of knowledge and her\r\nphotographic memory tried at one time or another to balance the scales.\r\nBut she wouldn\'t take so much as a cup of Canal water at their expense,\r\nlet alone the credits they tried to push on her. Bub Nelson was the only\r\none who got around her refusal. It was he who brought her Bat.\r\n\r\nAbout a year after the Jovan affair he walked into the Free Fall one\r\nnight and dumped Bat down on her table. Bat looked at Steena and\r\ngrowled. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
She looked calmly back at him and nodded once. From then on\r\nthey traveled together--the thin gray woman and the big gray tom-cat.\r\nBat learned to know the inside of more stellar bars than even most\r\nspacers visit in their lifetimes. He developed a liking for Vernal\r\njuice, drank it neat and quick, right out of a glass. And he was always\r\nat home on any table where Steena elected to drop him.\r\n\r\nThis is really the story of Steena, Bat, Cliff Moran and the _Empress of\r\nMars_, a story which is already a legend of the spaceways. And it\'s a\r\ndamn good story too. I ought to know, having framed the first version of\r\nit myself.\r\n\r\nFor I was there, right in the Rigel Royal, when it all began on the\r\nnight that Cliff Moran blew in, looking lower than an antman\'s belly and\r\ntwice as nasty. He\'d had a spell of luck foul enough to twist a man into\r\na slug-snake and we all knew that there was an attachment out for his\r\nship. Cliff had fought his way up from the back courts of Venaport. Lose\r\nhis ship and he\'d slip back there--to rot. He was at the snarling stage\r\nthat night when he picked out a table for himself and set out to drink\r\naway his troubles.\r\n\r\nHowever, just as the first bottle arrived, so did a visitor. Steena came\r\nout of her corner, Bat curled around her shoulders stole-wise, his\r\nfavorite mode of travel. She crossed over and dropped down without\r\ninvitation at Cliff\'s side. That shook him out of his sulks. Because\r\nSteena never chose company when she could be alone. If one of the\r\nman-stones on Ganymede had come stumping in, it wouldn\'t have made more\r\nof us look out of the corners of our eyes.\r\n\r\nShe stretched out one long-fingered hand and set aside the bottle he had\r\nordered and said only one thing, "It\'s about time for the _Empress of\r\nMars_ to appear again."\r\n\r\nCliff scowled and bit his lip. He was tough, tough as jet lining--you\r\nhave to be granite inside and out to struggle up from Venaport to a ship\r\ncommand. But we could guess what was running through his mind at that\r\nmoment. The _Empress of Mars_ was just about the biggest prize a spacer\r\ncould aim for. But in the fifty years she had been following her queer\r\nderelict orbit through space many men had tried to bring her in--and\r\nnone had succeeded.\r\n\r\nA pleasure-ship carrying untold wealth, she had been mysteriously\r\nabandoned in space by passengers and crew, none of whom had ever been\r\nseen or heard of again. At intervals thereafter she had been sighted,\r\neven boarded. Those who ventured into her either vanished or returned\r\nswiftly without any believable explanation of what they had\r\nseen--wanting only to get away from her as quickly as possible. But the\r\nman who could bring her in--or even strip her clean in space--that man\r\nwould win the jackpot.\r\n\r\n"All right!" Cliff slammed his fist down on the table. "I\'ll try even\r\nthat!"\r\n\r\nSteena looked at him, much as she must have looked at Bat the day Bub\r\nNelson brought him to her, and nodded. That was all I saw. The rest of\r\nthe story came to me in pieces, months later and in another port half\r\nthe System away.\r\n\r\nCliff took off that night. He was afraid to risk waiting--with a writ\r\nout that could pull the ship from under him. And it wasn\'t until he was\r\nin space that he discovered his passengers--Steena and Bat. We\'ll never\r\nknow what happened then. I\'m betting that Steena made no explanation at\r\nall. She wouldn\'t.\r\n\r\nIt was the first time she had decided to cash in on her own tip and she\r\nwas there--that was all. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Maybe that point weighed with Cliff, maybe he\r\njust didn\'t care. Anyway the three were together when they sighted the\r\n_Empress_ riding, her dead-lights gleaming, a ghost ship in night space.\r\n\r\nShe must have been an eerie sight because her other lights were on too,\r\nin addition to the red warnings at her nose. She seemed alive, a Flying\r\nDutchman of space. Cliff worked his ship skillfully alongside and had no\r\ntrouble in snapping magnetic lines to her lock. Some minutes later the\r\nthree of them passed into her. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
There was still air in her cabins and\r\ncorridors. Air that bore a faint corrupt taint which set Bat to sniffing\r\ngreedily and could be picked up even by the less sensitive human\r\nnostrils.\r\n\r\nCliff headed straight for the control cabin but Steena and Bat went\r\nprowling. Closed doors were a challenge to both of them and Steena\r\nopened each as she passed, taking a quick look at what lay within. The\r\nfifth door opened on a room which no woman could leave without further\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nI don\'t know who had been housed there when the _Empress_ left port on\r\nher last lengthy cruise. Anyone really curious can check back on the old\r\nphoto-reg cards. But there was a lavish display of silks trailing out of\r\ntwo travel kits on the floor, a dressing table crowded with crystal and\r\njeweled containers, along with other lures for the female which drew\r\nSteena in. She was standing in front of the dressing table when she\r\nglanced into the mirror--glanced into it and froze.\r\n\r\nOver her right shoulder she could see the spider-silk cover on the bed.\r\nRight in the middle of that sheer, gossamer expanse was a sparkling heap\r\nof gems, the dumped contents of some jewel case. Bat had jumped to the\r\nfoot of the bed and flattened out as cats will, watching those gems,\r\nwatching them and--something else!\r\n\r\nSteena put out her hand blindly and caught up the nearest bottle. As she\r\nunstoppered it she watched the mirrored bed. A gemmed bracelet rose from\r\nthe pile, rose in the air and tinkled its siren song. It was as if an\r\nidle hand played.... Bat spat almost noiselessly. But he did not\r\nretreat. Bat had not yet decided his course.\r\n\r\nShe put down the bottle. Then she did something which perhaps few of the\r\nmen she had listened to through the years could have done. She moved\r\nwithout hurry or sign of disturbance on a tour about the room. And,\r\nalthough she approached the bed she did not touch the jewels. She could\r\nnot force herself to that. It took her five minutes to play out her\r\ninnocence and unconcern. Then it was Bat who decided the issue.\r\n\r\nHe leaped from the bed and escorted something to the door, remaining a\r\ncareful distance behind. Then he mewed loudly twice. Steena followed him\r\nand opened the door wider.\r\n\r\nBat went straight on down the corridor, as intent as a hound on the\r\nwarmest of scents. Steena strolled behind him, holding her pace to the\r\nunhurried gait of an explorer. What sped before them both was invisible\r\nto her but Bat was never baffled by it.\r\n\r\nThey must have gone into the control cabin almost on the heels of the\r\nunseen--if the unseen had heels, which there was good reason to\r\ndoubt--for Bat crouched just within the doorway and refused to move on.\r\nSteena looked down the length of the instrument panels and officers\'\r\nstation-seats to where Cliff Moran worked. On the heavy carpet her boots\r\nmade no sound and he did not glance up but sat humming through set teeth\r\nas he tested the tardy and reluctant responses to buttons which had not\r\nbeen pushed in years.\r\n\r\nTo human eyes they were alone in the cabin. But Bat still followed a\r\nmoving something with his gaze. And it was something which he had at\r\nlast made up his mind to distrust and dislike. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
For now he took a step or\r\ntwo forward and spat--his loathing made plain by every raised hair along\r\nhis spine. And in that same moment Steena saw a flicker--a flicker of\r\nvague outline against Cliff\'s hunched shoulders as if the invisible one\r\nhad crossed the space between them.\r\n\r\nBut why had it been revealed against Cliff and not against the back of\r\none of the seats or against the panels, the walls of the corridor or the\r\ncover of the bed where it had reclined and played with its loot? What\r\ncould Bat see?\r\n\r\nThe storehouse memory that had served Steena so well through the years\r\nclicked open a half-forgotten door. With one swift motion she tore loose\r\nher spaceall and flung the baggy garment across the back of the nearest\r\nseat.\r\n\r\nBat was snarling now, emitting the throaty rising cry that was his\r\nhunting song. But he was edging back, back toward Steena\'s feet,\r\nshrinking from something he could not fight but which he faced\r\ndefiantly. If he could draw it after him, past that dangling\r\nspaceall.... He had to--it was their only chance.\r\n\r\n"What the...." Cliff had come out of his seat and was staring at them.\r\n\r\nWhat he saw must have been weird enough. Steena, bare-armed and\r\nshouldered, her usually stiffly-netted hair falling wildly down her\r\nback, Steena watching empty space with narrowed eyes and set mouth,\r\ncalculating a single wild chance. Bat, crouched on his belly, retreating\r\nfrom thin air step by step and wailing like a demon.\r\n\r\n"Toss me your blaster." Steena gave the order calmly--as if they still\r\nsat at their table in the Rigel Royal.\r\n\r\nAnd as quietly Cliff obeyed. She caught the small weapon out of the air\r\nwith a steady hand--caught and leveled it.\r\n\r\n"Stay just where you are!" she warned. "Back, Bat, bring it back!"\r\n\r\nWith a last throat-splitting screech of rage and hate, Bat twisted to\r\nsafety between her boots. She pressed with thumb and forefinger, firing\r\nat the spacealls. The material turned to powdery flakes of ash--except\r\nfor certain bits which still flapped from the scorched seat--as if\r\nsomething had protected them from the force of the blast. Bat sprang\r\nstraight up in the air with a scream that tore their ears.\r\n\r\n"What...?" began Cliff again.\r\n\r\nSteena made a warning motion with her left hand. "_Wait!_"\r\n\r\nShe was still tense, still watching Bat. The cat dashed madly around the\r\ncabin twice, running crazily with white-ringed eyes and flecks of foam\r\non his muzzle. Then he stopped abruptly in the doorway, stopped and\r\nlooked back over his shoulder for a long silent moment. He sniffed\r\ndelicately.\r\n\r\nSteena and Cliff could smell it too now, a thick oily stench which was\r\nnot the usual odor left by an exploding blaster-shell.\r\n\r\nBat came back, treading daintily across the carpet, almost on the tips\r\nof his paws. He raised his head as he passed Steena and then he went\r\nconfidently beyond to sniff, to sniff and spit twice at the unburned\r\nstrips of the spaceall. Having thus paid his respects to the late enemy\r\nhe sat down calmly and set to washing his fur with deliberation. Steena\r\nsighed once and dropped into the navigator\'s seat.\r\n\r\n"Maybe now you\'ll tell me what in the hell\'s happened?" Cliff exploded\r\nas he took the blaster out of her hand.\r\n\r\n"Gray," she said dazedly, "it must have been gray--or I couldn\'t have\r\nseen it like that. I\'m colorblind, you see. I can see only shades of\r\ngray--my whole world is gray. Like Bat\'s--his world is gray too--all\r\ngray. But he\'s been compensated for he can see above and below our range\r\nof color vibrations and--apparently--so can I!"\r\n\r\n\r\nHer voice quavered and she raised her chin with a new air Cliff had\r\nnever seen before--a sort of proud acceptance. She pushed back her\r\nwandering hair, but she made no move to imprison it under the heavy net\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"That is why I saw the thing when it crossed between us. Against your\r\nspaceall it was another shade of gray--an outline. So I put out mine and\r\nwaited for it to show against that--it was our only chance, Cliff.\r\n\r\n"It was curious at first, I think, and it knew we couldn\'t see it--which\r\nis why it waited to attack. But when Bat\'s actions gave it away it\r\nmoved. So I waited to see that flicker against the spaceall and then I\r\nlet him have it. It\'s really very simple...."\r\n\r\nCliff laughed a bit shakily. "But what _was_ this gray thing? 

=== Chunk 6 ===
I don\'t\r\nget it."\r\n\r\n"I think it was what made the _Empress_ a derelict. Something out of\r\nspace, maybe, or from another world somewhere." She waved her hands.\r\n"It\'s invisible because it\'s a color beyond our range of sight. It must\r\nhave stayed in here all these years. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
And it kills--it must--when its\r\ncuriosity is satisfied." Swiftly she described the scene in the cabin\r\nand the strange behavior of the gem pile which had betrayed the creature\r\nto her.\r\n\r\nCliff did not return his blaster to its holder. "Any more of them on\r\nboard, d\'you think?" 

=== Chunk 8 ===
He didn\'t look pleased at the prospect.\r\n\r\nSteena turned to Bat. He was paying particular attention to the space\r\nbetween two front toes in the process of a complete bath. "I don\'t think\r\nso. But Bat will tell us if there are. He can see them clearly, I\r\nbelieve."\r\n\r\nBut there weren\'t any more and two weeks later Cliff, Steena and Bat\r\nbrought the _Empress_ into the Lunar quarantine station. And that is the\r\nend of Steena\'s story because, as we have been told, happy marriages\r\nneed no chronicles. And Steena had found someone who knew of her gray\r\nworld and did not find it too hard to share with her--someone besides\r\nBat. It turned out to be a real love match.\r\n\r\nThe last time I saw her she was wrapped in a flame-red cloak from the\r\nlooms of Rigel and wore a fortune in Jovan rubies blazing on her wrists.\r\nCliff was flipping a three-figure credit bill to a waiter. And Bat had a\r\nrow of Vernal juice glasses set up before him. Just a little family\r\nparty out on the town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                                                              |\r\n  | Transcriber\'s note:                                          |\r\n  |                                                              |\r\n  | Inconsistent hyphenation (space-all/spaceall) has been       |\r\n  | retained.                                                    |\r\n  |                                                              |\r\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
