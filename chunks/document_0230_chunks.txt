It\r\n wasn\'t their fault that they\r\n came to Earth much too late._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beings stood around my bed in air suits like ski suits, with globes\r\nover their heads like upside-down fishbowls. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
It was all like a\r\nmasquerade, with odd costumes and funny masks.\r\n\r\nI know that the masks are their faces, but I argue with them and find I\r\nthink as if I am arguing with humans behind the masks. They are people.\r\nI recognize people and whether I am going to like this person or that\r\nperson by something in the way they move and how they get excited when\r\nthey talk; and I know that I like these people in a motherly sort of\r\nway. You have to feel motherly toward them, I guess.\r\n\r\nThey all remind me of Ronny, a medical student I knew once. He was small\r\nand round and eager. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
You had to like him, but you couldn\'t take him very\r\nseriously. He was a pacifist; he wrote poetry and pulled it out to read\r\naloud at ill-timed moments; and he stuttered when he talked too fast.\r\n\r\nThey are like that, all fright and gentleness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI am not the only survivor--they have explained that--but I am the first\r\nthey found, and the least damaged, the one they have chosen to represent\r\nthe human race to them. They stand around my bed and answer questions,\r\nand are nice to me when I argue with them.\r\n\r\nAll in a group they look half-way between a delegation of nations and an\r\nark, one of each, big and small, thick and thin, four arms or wings, all\r\nshapes and colors in fur and skin and feathers.\r\n\r\nI can picture them in their UN of the Universe, making speeches in their\r\ndifferent languages, listening patiently without understanding each\r\nother\'s different problems, boring each other and being too polite to\r\nyawn.\r\n\r\nThey are polite, so polite I almost feel they are afraid of me, and I\r\nwant to reassure them.\r\n\r\nBut I talk as if I were angry. I can\'t help it, because if things had\r\nonly been a little different ... "Why couldn\'t you have come sooner? 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Why\r\ncouldn\'t you have tried to stop it before it happened, or at least come\r\nsooner, afterward...?"\r\n\r\nIf they had come sooner to where the workers of the Nevada power pile\r\nstarved slowly behind their protecting walls of lead--if they had looked\r\nsooner for survivors of the dust with which the nations of the world had\r\nslain each other--George Craig would be alive. He died before they came.\r\nHe was my co-worker, and I loved him.\r\n\r\nWe had gone down together, passing door by door the automatic safeguards\r\nof the plant, which were supposed to protect the people on the outside\r\nfrom the radioactive danger from the inside--but the danger of a failure\r\nof politics was far more real than the danger of failure in the science\r\nof the power pile, and that had not been calculated by the builders. We\r\nwere far underground when the first radioactivity in the air outside had\r\nshut all the heavy, lead-shielded automatic doors between us and the\r\noutside.\r\n\r\nWe were safe. And we starved there.\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t you come sooner?" I wonder if they know or guess how I feel.\r\nMy questions are not questions, but I have to ask them. He is dead. I\r\ndon\'t mean to reproach them--they look well meaning and kindly--but I\r\nfeel as if, somehow, knowing why it happened could make it stop, could\r\nlet me turn the clock back and make it happen differently. If I could\r\nhave signaled them, so they would have come just a little sooner.\r\n\r\nThey look at one another, turning their funny-face heads uneasily,\r\nmoving back and forth, but no one will answer.\r\n\r\nThe world is dead.... George is dead, that thin, pathetic creature with\r\nthe bones showing through his skin that he was when we sat still at the\r\nlast with our hands touching, thinking there were people outside who had\r\nforgotten us, hoping they would remember. We didn\'t guess that the world\r\nwas dead, blanketed in radiating dust outside. Politics had killed it.\r\n\r\nThese beings around me, they had been watching, seeing what was going to\r\nhappen to our world, listening to our radios from their small\r\nsettlements on the other planets of the Solar System. They had seen the\r\ndoom of war coming. They represented stellar civilizations of great\r\npower and technology, and with populations that would have made ours\r\nseem a small village; they were stronger than we were, and yet they had\r\ndone nothing.\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t you stop us? You could have stopped us."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA rabbity one who is closer than the others backs away, gesturing\r\npolitely that he is giving room for someone else to speak, but he looks\r\nguilty and will not look at me with his big round eyes. I still feel\r\nweak and dizzy. It is hard to think, but I feel as if they are hiding a\r\nsecret.\r\n\r\nA doelike one hesitates and comes closer to my bed. "We discussed it ...\r\nwe voted...." It talks through a microphone in its helmet with a soft\r\nlisping accent that I think comes from the shape of its mouth. It has a\r\nmuzzle and very soft, dainty, long nibbling lips like a deer that\r\nnibbles on twigs and buds.\r\n\r\n"We were afraid," adds one who looks like a bear.\r\n\r\n"To us the future was very terrible," says one who looks as if it\r\nmight have descended from some sort of large bird like a penguin. "So\r\nmuch-- Your weapons were very terrible."\r\n\r\nNow they all talk at once, crowding about my bed, apologizing. "So much\r\nkilling. It hurt to know about. But your people didn\'t seem to mind."\r\n\r\n"We were afraid."\r\n\r\n"And in your fiction," the doelike one lisped, "I saw plays from your\r\namusement machines which said that the discovery of beings in space\r\nwould save you from war, not because you would let us bring friendship\r\nand teach peace, but because the human race would unite in _hatred_ of\r\nthe outsiders. They would forget their hatred of each other only in a\r\nnew and more terrible war with us." Its voice breaks in a squeak and it\r\nturns its face away from me.\r\n\r\n"You were about to come out into space. We were wondering how to hide!"\r\nThat is a quick-talking one, as small as a child. He looks as if he\r\nmight have descended from a bat--gray silken fur on his pointed face,\r\nbig night-seeing eyes, and big sensitive ears, with a humped shape on\r\nthe back of his air suit which might be folded wings. "We were trying to\r\nconceal where we had built, so that humans would not guess we were near\r\nand look for us."\r\n\r\nThey are ashamed of their fear, for because of it they broke all the\r\nkindly laws of their civilizations, restrained all the pity and\r\ngentleness I see in them, and let us destroy ourselves.\r\n\r\nI am beginning to feel more awake and to see more clearly. And I am\r\nbeginning to feel sorry for them, for I can see why they are afraid.\r\n\r\nThey are herbivores. I remember the meaning of shapes. In the paths\r\nof evolution there are grass eaters and berry eaters and root diggers.\r\nEach has its functional shape of face and neck--and its wide,\r\nstartled-looking eyes to see and run away from the hunters. In all their\r\nracial history they have never killed to eat. They have been killed and\r\neaten, or run away, and they evolved to intelligence by selection. Those\r\nlived who succeeded in running away from carnivores like lions, hawks,\r\nand men.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI look up, and they turn their eyes and heads in quick embarrassed\r\nmotion, not meeting my eye. The rabbity one is nearest and I reach out\r\nto touch him, pleased because I am growing strong enough now to move my\r\narms. He looks at me and I ask the question: "Are there any\r\ncarnivores--flesh eaters--among you?"\r\n\r\nHe hesitates, moving his lips as if searching for tactful words. "We\r\nhave never found any that were civilized. We have frequently found them\r\nin caves and tents fighting each other. Sometimes we find them fighting\r\neach other with the ruins of cities around them, but they are always\r\nsavages."\r\n\r\nThe bearlike one said heavily, "It might be that carnivores evolve more\r\nrapidly and tend toward intelligence more often, for we find radioactive\r\nplanets without life, and places like the place you call your asteroid\r\nbelt, where a planet should be--but there are only scattered fragments\r\nof planet, pieces that look as if a planet had been blown apart. We\r\nthink that usually ..." He looked at me uncertainly, beginning to\r\nfumble his words. "We think ..."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"Yours is the only carnivorous race we have found that was--civilized,\r\nthat had a science and was going to come out into space," the doelike\r\none interrupted softly. "We were afraid."\r\n\r\nThey seem to be apologizing.\r\n\r\nThe rabbity one, who seems to be chosen as the leader in speaking to me,\r\nsays, "We will give you anything you want. Anything we are able to give\r\nyou.

=== Chunk 5 ===
"\r\n\r\nThey mean it. We survivors will be privileged people, with a key to all\r\nthe cities, everything free. Their sincerity is wonderful, but puzzling.\r\nAre they trying to atone for the thing they feel was a crime; that they\r\nallowed humanity to murder itself, and lost to the Galaxy the richness\r\nof a race? Is this why they are so generous?\r\n\r\nPerhaps then they will help the race to get started again. The records\r\nare not lost. The few survivors can eventually repopulate Earth. Under\r\nthe tutelage of these peaceable races, without the stress of division\r\ninto nations, we will flower as a race. No children of mine to the\r\nfurthest descendant will ever make war again. This much of a lesson we\r\nhave learned.\r\n\r\nThese timid beings do not realize how much humanity has wanted peace.\r\nThey do not know how reluctantly we were forced and trapped by old\r\ninstitutions and warped tangles of politics to which we could see no\r\nanswer. We are not naturally savage. We are not savage when approached\r\nas individuals. Perhaps they know this, but are afraid anyhow,\r\ninstinctive fear rising up from the blood of their hunted, frightened\r\nforebears.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe human race will be a good partner to these races. Even recovering\r\nfrom starvation as I am, I can feel in myself an energy they do not\r\nhave. The savage in me and my race is a creative thing, for in those who\r\nhave been educated as I was it is a controlled savagery which attacks\r\nand destroys only problems and obstacles, never people. Any human raised\r\noutside of the political traditions that the race inherited from its\r\nbloodstained childhood would be as friendly and ready for friendship as\r\nI am toward these beings. I could never hurt these pleasant, overgrown\r\nbunnies and squirrels.\r\n\r\n"We will do everything we can to make up for ... we will try to help,"\r\nsays the bunny, stumbling over the English, but civilized and cordial\r\nand kind.\r\n\r\nI sit up suddenly, reaching out impulsively to shake his hand. Suddenly\r\nfrightened he leaps back. All of them step back, glancing behind them as\r\nthough making sure of the avenue of escape. Their big luminous eyes\r\nwiden and glance rapidly from me to the doors, frightened.\r\n\r\nThey must think I am about to leap out of bed and pounce on them and eat\r\nthem. I am about to laugh and reassure them, about to say that all I\r\nwant from them is friendship, when I feel a twinge in my abdomen from\r\nthe sudden motion. I touch it with one hand under the bedclothes.\r\n\r\nThere is the scar of an incision there, almost healed. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
An operation. The\r\nweakness I am recovering from is more than the weakness of starvation.\r\n\r\nFor only half a second I do not understand; then I see why they looked\r\nashamed.\r\n\r\nThey voted the murder of a race.\r\n\r\nAll the human survivors found have been made sterile. There will be no\r\nmore humans after we die.\r\n\r\nI am frozen, one hand still extended to grasp the hand of the rabbity\r\none, my eyes still searching his expression, reassuring words still half\r\nformed.\r\n\r\nThere will be time for anger or grief later, for now, in this instant, I\r\ncan understand. They are probably quite right.\r\n\r\nWe were carnivores.\r\n\r\nI know, because, at this moment of hatred, I could kill them all.\r\n\r\n                                                        --G.
