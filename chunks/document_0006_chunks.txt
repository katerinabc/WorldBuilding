Still,\r\nCaptain Hinrik clung to the hope that the legend would not be borne out\r\nby truth. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
Perhaps the west continent still existed; perhaps, dare he\r\nhope, with civilization. The crew of the Semilunis thought him quite\r\nmad. After all, hadn't the east and south continents been completely\r\nannihilated from the great sky fires; and wasn't it said that they had\r\nsuffered but a fraction of what the west continent had endured?\r\n\r\nThe Semilunis anchored at the mouth of a great river. The months of fear\r\nand doubt were at end. Here, at last, was the west continent. A small\r\nparty of scouts was sent ashore with many cautions to be alert for\r\nluminescent areas which meant certain death for those who remained too\r\nlong in its vicinity. Armed with bow and arrow, the party made its way\r\nslowly up the great river. Nowhere was to be seen the color green, only\r\ndull browns and greys. And no sign of life, save for an occasional patch\r\nof lichen on a rock.\r\n\r\nAfter several days of rowing, the food and water supply was almost half\r\ndepleted and still no evidence of either past or present habitation. It\r\nwas time to turn back, to travel all the weary months across the West\r\nWater, the journey all in vain. What a small reward for such an arduous\r\ntrip ... just proof of the existence of a barren land mass, ugly and\r\nuseless.\r\n\r\nOn the second day of the return to the Semilunis, the scouting party\r\ndecided to stop and investigate a huge opening in the rocky mountainside.\r\nHow suspiciously regular and even it looked, particularly in comparison\r\nto the rest of the countryside which was jagged and chaotic.\r\n\r\nThey entered the cave apprehensively, torches aflare and weapons in\r\nhand. But all was darkness and quiet.

Still, the regularity of the cave\r\nwalls led them on. Some creature, man or otherwise, must have planned\r\nand built this ... but to what end? Now the cave divided into three\r\nforks. The torches gave only a hint of the immensity of the chambers\r\nthat lay at the end of each. They selected the center chamber,\r\napproaching cautiously, breath caught in awe and excitement. The torches\r\nreflected on a dull black surface which was divided into many, many\r\nlittle squares. The sameness of them stretched for uncountable yards in\r\nall directions. What were these ungodly looking edifices? The black\r\nsurface was cold and smooth to the touch and quite regular except for a\r\nstrange little hole at the bottom of each square and a curious row of\r\npictures along the top.\r\n\r\nThey would copy these strange pictures. Perhaps back home there would be\r\na scholar who would understand the meaning behind these last remains of\r\nthe people of the west continent.
