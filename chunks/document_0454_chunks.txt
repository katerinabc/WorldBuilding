But George Barlow, like\r\n           other fathers, knew that disaster would end his--\r\n\r\n                              WANDERLUST\r\n\r\n                           By Alan E. Nourse\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Imagination Stories of Science and Fantasy\r\n                             October 1952\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSomehow George Barlow had sensed that something was wrong the moment\r\nhis son drove into the barnyard that evening. He had been waiting\r\nimpatiently for Tad\'s return all afternoon; the men needed those\r\ntractor bolts before they could do the mowing. But George had felt the\r\nuneasiness, quite suddenly, deep in his chest when he heard the boy\'s\r\nthree-wheeler chugging up the rutted country road from town.\r\n\r\nHe sat quietly, waiting, stroking old Snuffy behind the ears. He heard\r\nthe little motor-car pop into silence as Tad drove it into the garage;\r\nthen there was a long silence. George waited several minutes before\r\nrunning a hand through his tawny hair. "What\'s that boy doing out\r\nthere, anyway?" he growled.\r\n\r\nFlorence Barlow glanced up through the kitchen window. "He\'s gone up on\r\nthe ridge," she said. "He\'s just standing up there, looking down the\r\nvalley." She turned back to the stove, pushing back an unruly whisp of\r\ngraying hair.\r\n\r\nGeorge sat back in his chair, puffing his pipe, the uneasiness growing.\r\nTad was usually back from town hours earlier. The oats had to be\r\ncut this week--the shipment of Venusian _taaro_ was due from the next\r\nRocket, and they had to have a field free for it. But still, he knew it\r\nwas more than the tractor bolts that bothered him.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly the door burst open and Tad was there, filling the room\r\nwith his broad shoulders, whistling tunelessly to himself. A cool east\r\nbreeze followed him in the door, and with it an aura of excitement.\r\nTad\'s sunbaked hair was wild from the ride through the wind, his sharp\r\neyes sparkling:\r\n\r\n"Dad! The Rocket landed this afternoon. Out at Dillon\'s Landing. It\'s\r\nthree weeks early this time!"\r\n\r\nA chill swept up George\'s spine, tingling his scalp. "Then we should\r\nget the _taaro_ in a couple of days," he said smoothly.\r\n\r\n"We should." Tad\'s eyes were bright as he patted the dog\'s head. His\r\nwhole body seemed alive with excitement. "I walked up on the ridge to\r\nget a look at it, dad. It\'s a beauty--tall and slim--you should see it\r\ndown there. It catches the sunset like you never saw before--"\r\n\r\nHe was still talking as he walked out to the kitchen, stooping to kiss\r\nhis mother on the forehead. "You ought to go up and take a look at it,\r\nmom--before the sun\'s gone."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got plenty to do without going to gawk at a Rocket ship," his\r\nmother\'s voice was sharp. "You have too, for that matter. Did you get\r\nthe tractor bolts for your father?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe boy frowned suddenly, and snapped his fingers. "Plumb forgot them.\r\nThe ship was landing just as I got into town, so I went over to watch\r\nit--" he took his place opposite his father at the table, his face\r\nbrightening again. He didn\'t see the cloud on his father\'s face. "And\r\nthey let us go inside it to look around, dad. I never saw anything\r\nlike it. You wouldn\'t believe that they could get such a ship off the\r\nground. Why, even I can remember when it was all they could do to blast\r\noff with a little ten-man ship, and now--why, this one is like a yacht.\r\nIt\'s the STAR KING, the newest one in Dillon\'s fleet."\r\n\r\nGeorge Barlow scowled, the tightness in the pit of his stomach suddenly\r\nmaking his food tasteless. "That\'s lovely," he said sourly. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
"They can\r\nbuild them a mile long for all I care. They still aren\'t fit for rats.\r\nAt least here you can wash your face if you want to--" He turned back\r\nto his plate, hoping the discussion was over, hoping--\r\n\r\n"But this one had complete showers, soft bunks, everything. Hydroponic\r\ntanks that make the experimental station look like pikers--"\r\n\r\n"Eat," said George.\r\n\r\nTad lapsed into silence, the hearty silence of a hungry\r\nnineteen-year-old before a full dinner plate. His father took another\r\nmouthful and put down his fork, his appetite gone. He could feel the\r\ntension growing, the tightness of his breathing. He sensed his wife\'s\r\napprehension as she too slowed and stopped eating. As if she, too,\r\nwere waiting--\r\n\r\n"Saw Len Cooper when he came off the ship, too, dad. Do you remember\r\nLen? 

=== Chunk 3 ===
This was his first cruise." Tad\'s eyes sparkled. "He says there\'s\r\nnothing like it, that Rocket life. They stopped on Venus, you know, and\r\nthen did a reconnaissance in toward the Mercury orbit before they came\r\nback. Almost five years away from Earth! They\'ve got a stack of reports\r\nas big as an almanac for printing. And Len--you know how scrawny he\r\nwas? He\'s put on muscle now. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Looks great." Tad put down his fork, a\r\nsubtle change in his voice, his hand trembling. "We had a long talk,\r\ndad. Len says--"\r\n\r\n"Len Cooper\'s a fool!" George Barlow\'s voice snapped irritably. "He\r\nhasn\'t got all his marbles. A kid like that--all the potential in the\r\nworld--brains, opportunity--and what does he do with it? Shoots it into\r\nRockets! First cruise, huh? It isn\'t his last, by a long shot. Those\r\nRocket boys aren\'t stupid. They know it takes a good cruise to teach\r\na youngster his way around out there. He can\'t begin to work for his\r\nwages until the second cruise, or the third. And then it\'s too late to\r\ncome back--"\r\n\r\nTad fiddled with his fork, his eyes down. The room was silent; even\r\nFlorence sat tense, startled by the outburst. George sat glumly. That\r\nwas stupid, he thought. Inexcusably stupid. You\'ll have to face it\r\nsome day--you know that. Now? Maybe--oh, Lord, not now--maybe tomorrow.\r\nBut what could you say? What if it _is_ now? His hand trembled as he\r\nfumbled awkwardly for his pipe. Where were the words, the phrases, the\r\narguments, so long rehearsed, so sensible, so fatherly?\r\n\r\n"Dad."\r\n\r\nHis fingers were like ice on the pipe bowl. Not tomorrow, then. Now.\r\n\r\n"Dad."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Tad."\r\n\r\nThe boy looked straight at his father, his voice very low. "I\'m going,\r\ndad," he said. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
"I\'m going with it."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe chill widened in George Barlow\'s stomach, spreading into his legs\r\nand chest. He heard his wife\'s startled gasp, and the chill deepened.\r\nHe searched for words, and no words came. How long, now, had he\r\nprepared, rehearsed? And now--nothing. He just sat there in the dead\r\nstill room--\r\n\r\n"Well, I never heard anything more ridiculous in all my life!" Florence\r\nburst out finally. "You\'re crazy, Tad. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Plumb crazy. Do you mean to sit\r\nthere and say that you\'re going to give up college, throw away this\r\nfarm?" She set the cream pitcher down with a thump. "It\'s out of the\r\nquestion. You just can\'t mean it."\r\n\r\nTad wriggled uneasily. "I do mean it, mom. The STAR KING is signing up\r\ncrew tomorrow. They have places for four novices, this time. They\'ll\r\ntake me. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
I know they will. I--I asked this afternoon. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
I want to go."\r\n\r\nGeorge Barlow gripped the edge of the table, fighting for control.\r\n"Don\'t be silly, boy," he said finally, his voice tight. "You\'re no\r\nRocket man. You don\'t know what you\'re saying--" his hands trembled.\r\n"Space is no place for a fellow like you--you belong here, studying,\r\nworking--not hopping around space like a common tramp." He tamped\r\ntobacco into his pipe bowl with an air of finality. "Every boy nowadays\r\nthinks about going to Space, I know. The fleets are growing larger,\r\ntaking more and more boys--but the smart ones stay home."\r\n\r\nTad\'s voice was low and quiet, more deadly firm than George had ever\r\nheard it. "You don\'t understand, dad. I know you don\'t like it--I\r\nknow you think it\'s foolish not to finish college, you hate to see me\r\nleave home--but you don\'t understand." He looked up, his boyish face\r\npale under deep summer tan. "I can\'t explain it, dad. Ever since I was\r\nlittle, since I saw my first Rocket shooting up into the sky toward\r\nthe stars, I knew I had to go, too, sometime." He shook his head\r\nhelplessly. "It\'s what I\'ve wanted all my life, dad. I\'ve _got_ to go."\r\n\r\n"But the farm, son--" Florence was almost in tears. "Doesn\'t that mean\r\nanything to you? Your family\'s been here for a hundred years, Tad.\r\nIt\'s yours, as soon as you\'re ready to farm it. Don\'t you _care_ about\r\nit after all these years?"\r\n\r\n"You know I care, mom." The boy avoided her tearful eyes, ran a hand\r\nthrough his hair. "You know I like the place, and I feel awful running\r\nout after all the work you and dad and the men have put in, building\r\nit up--but I couldn\'t make a go of it. I don\'t want to be earth-bound,\r\ntied down to a piece of land all my life--"\r\n\r\nHis mother\'s face was suddenly very, very tired. "Oh, you fool," she\r\nsaid, her voice bitter. "You don\'t know how you\'ll long for green\r\ngrass again--" her face flared red in anger. "You\'ve barely started to\r\nshave, and you want to go to Space. Well, it\'s nonsense! 

=== Chunk 9 ===
You can\'t do\r\nit, that\'s final. Tell him, George! Tell him why he can\'t go--tell him\r\nwhy--"\r\n\r\n"_Florence!_"\r\n\r\nShe stopped short, eyes wide. "George, I\'m sorry--"\r\n\r\nHis voice was sharp, urgent. "I think--maybe Tad and I ought to talk\r\nthis out--ourselves--"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry, George." Florence Barlow rose silently. She began clearing\r\nthe table, her eyes brimming.\r\n\r\nTad\'s face was troubled. "I wish you wouldn\'t make a fuss, dad. I\r\nsuppose it\'s a surprise to you both--"\r\n\r\nGeorge smiled sourly. "Hardly. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
We\'ve been around a while, Tad. We saw\r\nLen Cooper go, and a half-dozen like him. We knew you\'d get the bug\r\nsooner or later. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
But you\'ve got to understand why we can\'t allow it."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe room was silent, except for the faint rustling of the breeze\r\nthrough the curtains. "You don\'t know what you\'re walking into, Tad.\r\nNone of you boys really know. You only see one side of the picture,\r\nthe excitement and adventure. I know, it\'s a thrilling picture, but\r\nthe thrill wears off, and then you have the long dull days of waiting,\r\nsitting, always waiting, with nothing to see but the bulkhead and a\r\ndozen men cramped into impossible tight quarters without any room to\r\nmove around. You don\'t know how you\'d get to hate those men, how you\'d\r\nwish you could be alone for just a little while, how you\'d long for\r\nprivacy. And you don\'t realize the danger--not the exciting, bravado\r\nkind of danger that you read about, but the live, horrible danger of\r\ndepending for your life on a little sliver of metal.\r\n\r\n"So many things can go wrong, and any one of them means you\'re through.\r\nNot a brave death, son, nor a heroic death--just a very lonely death,\r\nwhere you freeze and starve, and feel the life choke out of you. There\r\nare so many ways to die in Space, such horrible ways, so easily. And\r\nthere isn\'t any reward worth the risk. It\'s all risk, and you have\r\nnothing for it. A few days of glory when you\'re back home, and then\r\nyou\'re off again. Once you go, you\'re gone. You\'ll never come back.\r\nOnly the lucky ones come back. You\'ll be in Space \'til it kills you."\r\n\r\n"But the colonies, dad. Mars Mountain, Player\'s Folly,\r\nIronstone--they\'re all going concerns. They need men, lots of men, with\r\nideas--men who aren\'t afraid of work--"\r\n\r\n"The colonies!" George Barlow\'s voice rose angrily, his control wearing\r\nthin. "Why the colonies? What glory can you see in working a lifetime\r\nto squeeze a living out of Mars rock? Scraping and fighting, squeezing\r\nevery last drop of water, every possible inch of topsoil to dig up\r\nenough to keep barely alive--and then dying thirty years before your\r\ntime? What can you see in that? Or Venus, where you sweat, and waste\r\naway, until the fungus gets into your lungs and blood, and you finally\r\njust go to sleep forever? You\'re crazy, Tad! 

=== Chunk 12 ===
You can\'t do it!"\r\n\r\nTad shuffled his feet, his eyes downcast. "I knew you wouldn\'t\r\nunderstand. I can\'t explain it, dad--I don\'t know the words. But I\'ve\r\ngot to go, even if you don\'t--"\r\n\r\nGeorge\'s face flushed in exasperation. "Now look. Just listen a minute.\r\nI understand perfectly, I just--"\r\n\r\n"_You don\'t understand!_" The boy\'s eyes blazed in sudden anger, his\r\nvoice was bitter. "How _could_ you understand? You\'ve been nothing but\r\na slogging dirt farmer all your life! How could you understand why I\'d\r\nwant to go to the stars? What do you know about Mars, or Venus? _You\'ve\r\nnever been there!_"\r\n\r\nGeorge Barlow sat stiff, as though he had been struck. The room was\r\ntense, and he heard the boy breathing across the room. "Then you give\r\nme no choice," he said finally, his voice suddenly tired and barely\r\naudible. "I\'m your father. I forbid you to go."\r\n\r\nThere was a long, silent moment. Then: "I\'m sorry, dad. I\'m going\r\nanyway."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGeorge Barlow lay in bed, breathing quietly. The room was close, the\r\nair stuffy and humid. He heard his wife\'s steady breathing, peaceful\r\nnow, after sobbing herself to sleep. And somehow, deep within him,\r\nhe seemed to hear the steady pom-pom-pom of spaceship engines, deep,\r\nthroaty, thrilling, throbbing, vibrating--\r\n\r\nCalling--\r\n\r\nHe rose quietly and walked to the window. He heard Snuffy stir herself,\r\nheard her claws scrabbling on the bare farmhouse floor, and felt her\r\nwarm muzzle, firm and comforting in his hand. Then he heard nothing but\r\nthe buzzing of cicadas, the quiet night-sounds of the farm, smelled\r\nthe cool, hearty odor of hay and clover, heard the occasional uneasy\r\nstomping of cattle in the barn. And still, deep in his mind, he heard\r\nolder sounds, more familiar sounds, sounds tinged with fear, horror,\r\nhate, desperation--he shook his head, trying to forget, but there was\r\nexcitement there, too, that intangible, overpowering thrill of the\r\nwanderlust--\r\n\r\nMemories flooded back into his mind, memories he had thought long ago\r\nblotted out and forgotten. The rich thrill of excitement as the last\r\nseconds crowded in close, with the strap cutting a deep welt across his\r\nchest--the muffled roar, the powerful sledge-hammer blow, driving his\r\nstomach and legs down like lead, then easing, easing gently into no\r\npressure, then less than no pressure--the exhilarating, wonder-filled\r\nvision of the Earth rushing away, dwindling into a mottled patchwork,\r\nstill dwindling--\r\n\r\nOh, he understood, all right. He knew what tugged at his son\'s heels,\r\nhe knew the consuming thrill, the insatiable hunger to reach higher\r\nand higher, to seek out unknown places. He knew the wonder of stepping\r\non another land, an alien land, the thrill of watching two moons creep\r\nsoftly over a reddish horizon. He knew the deep, rich thrill of pushing\r\nthe frontier outward until the sun winked coldly like another star.\r\nMemories flooded his mind, and he remembered too well the insistent tug\r\nof the wanderlust at his heels, the call of the open road, the call of\r\nspace. And he knew that, try as he would, no Earth-bound answer would\r\never drive it away--\r\n\r\nYes, he understood. But deep in his heart he felt the coldness, the\r\npain and agony, the sense of bitter loss. He was one of the lucky. He\r\nhad come back. Tad would never come back. The odds were too great,\r\nthere were too few of the lucky. And it was better _not_ to be one of\r\nthe lucky, better to die out there, forgotten, unmourned.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMaybe he should have told the boy while he was young, tried to teach\r\nhim, to make him understand. Perhaps he\'d been wrong to conceal it all\r\nthese years, to lie to Tad, to make Florence conceal, too. Perhaps Tad\r\nshould have been told--but even knowing that someday the wanderlust\r\nwould come, he knew he couldn\'t have told him. Better to conceal, to\r\nwait for the contempt, wait to hear the words, short, bitter words:\r\n"_How could you ever understand? You\'ve never been there_--"\r\n\r\nGeorge felt the perspiration trickle down his neck. How could he\r\nexplain the things he hardly dared think about himself? The fear, the\r\nbitterness, the horror? Tad would be sleeping now, peacefully, in his\r\nroom, his bag half packed on the dresser, dreaming dreams of wonder\r\nin his sleep, and never dreaming for an instant of the terror, the\r\npain--never knowing how hard a taskmaster the wanderlust could be, what\r\nterrible fees it could exact.\r\n\r\nHe knew he couldn\'t fight it. He had known since Tad was born that it\r\nwould be useless. For the young saw only what they wanted to see.\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly George was fumbling in his dresser drawer, frantically\r\nsearching for the small oblong box, rushing, before he changed his\r\nmind. His hands closed on the small container, and its contents were\r\ncold between his fingers. And then he was in Tad\'s room, quietly,\r\nseeking the bag, half packed, a few meager clothes, a few meager\r\nmemories to go away with a hopeful heart. He fumbled in the bag, and\r\nsuddenly the memories closed in on George Barlow, and he was living\r\nagain the horrible moments, the rumbling, jolting thunder in the\r\nbowels of the ship; the frantic scrambling down the dark passageways,\r\nthe men, fear-crazed and tumbling over each other in free fall--the\r\ngleaming white-hot of the atomic fires gone wild; the screams of agony,\r\nthe crashing, fiery groping through oven-like chambers, the twisting,\r\nwrenching of controls, fighting to stay alive, fighting in blazing\r\nagony, fire burning to the bottom of his soul--\r\n\r\nThe little metal disc slipped into the boy\'s bag, down between a pair\r\nof pants and a book; a thin metal disc of pure gold, a simple symbol,\r\nwith simple words: _To George L. Barlow, for Heroism in Space_--\r\n\r\nHe dropped the disc into the boy\'s bag and stumbled back to his room.\r\nHe sat in the silence stroking old Snuffy\'s soft muzzle, sat in\r\ndarkness, eternal since that hour of terror, as tears streamed down\r\nscarred cheeks from his sightless eyes....\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
