I went\r\nto this one mainly to listen to Paul Kutrov and Frank Alva bait each\r\nother, which is usually more entertaining than most double features.\r\nKutrov adheres to the "onward and upward" school of linear progress,\r\nwhile Alva is more or less of a Spenglerian. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
More when he goes along by\r\nhimself; less when you try to pin him down to it. And since the subject\r\nof tonight\'s revelations would be the pre-Mohammed Arabian Culture, I\'d\r\nfind Alva inclined toward my side of the debate, which is strictly\r\nmorphological and without any pious theories of "progress".\r\n\r\nI\'d completely forgotten that Jocelyn had mentioned something about\r\nhaving a special attraction: a "Mr. Fayliss", who, she insisted, was a\r\ntroubadour. I didn\'t comment, not wanting to spend a day with Jocelyn on\r\nthe phone, exploring the Provence.\r\n\r\nThe night wasn\'t too warm for August, and there were occasional gusts of\r\nair seeping through the layers of tobacco smoke that hovered over the\r\nassemblage. As usual, it was a heterogeneous crowd, which rapidly formed\r\nnumerous islands of discourse. The trade winds carried salient gems of\r\nintelligence throughout the entire archipelago at times, and Jocelyn\r\nwalked upon the water, scurrying from one body to another, sopping up\r\nthe overflow of "culture". She visited our atoll, where Kutrov\'s\r\npassionate exposition had already raised the mean temperature some\r\ndegrees, but didn\'t stay long. Such debates didn\'t suggest any course of\r\nsocial or political action, and couldn\'t be trued in to any of her\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\nMy attention was wandering from the Kutrov-Alva variations, for Bill had\r\nonly been speaking for ten minutes, and could not be expected to arrive\r\nat any point whatsoever for at least another fifteen. From the east of\r\nus came apocalyptic figures of nuclear physics; from the west, I heard\r\nthe strains of Mondrian interwoven with Picasso; south of us, a post\r\nmortem on the latest "betrayal" of this or that aspiration of "the\r\npeople", and to the north, we heard the mysteries of atonality. It was\r\nwhile I was looking around, and letting these things roll over me, that\r\nI saw the stranger enter. Jocelyn immediately bounced up from a couch,\r\nleaving the crucial problem of atmosphere-poisoning via fission and/or\r\nfusion bombs suspended, and made effusive noises.\r\n\r\nThis, then, was the "troubadour"--Mr. Fayliss. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
The Main Attraction was\r\ndecidedly prepossessing. Tall, peculiarly graceful both in appearance\r\nand manner, dressed with an immaculateness that seemed excessive in this\r\npost-Bohemian circle. There was a decided musical quality to his speech,\r\nas he made polite comments upon being introduced to each of us, and an\r\nexactness in sentence-structure, word-choices and enunciation that\r\nbespoke the foreigner. Jocelyn took him around with the air of\r\nconducting a quick tour through a museum, then settled him momentarily\r\nwith the music group, now in darkest Schoenberg, only partially\r\nilluminated by "Wozzek". I watched Fayliss long enough to solidify an\r\nimpression that he was at ease here--but not merely in this particular\r\ndiscussion. It was a case of his being simply at ease, period.\r\n\r\nKutrov was watching him, too, and I saw now that there would be a\r\nmost-likely permanent digression. Too bad--I\'d had a feeling that when\r\nhe came to his point, it would have been a strong one. "Hungarian, do\r\nyou suppose?" he asked.\r\n\r\nAlva examined the evidence. Fayliss had high cheekbones, longish eyes,\r\nwith large pupils. He was lean, without giving an impression of\r\nthinness. He had not taken off his gloves, and I wondered if he would\r\ncome forth with a monocle; if he had, it would not have seemed an\r\naffectation.\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t say Slavic," Alva said. He started off on ethnology, and we\r\ntoured the Near East again. I jumped into the break when Kutrov was\r\nswallowing beer and Alva lighting a cigaret to observe that Fayliss\r\nreminded me of some Egyptian portraits--although I couldn\'t set the\r\nperiod. "If those eyes of his don\'t shine in the dark," I added, "they\r\nought to."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA brief pause for appreciation, then Jocelyn was calling for all men\'s\r\nattention. She managed to get it in reasonably short order, took a deep\r\nbreath, then dived into announcing that our "special guest, Mr. Fayliss"\r\nwas going to deliver a song-cycle.\r\n\r\nFayliss arose, bowed slightly, then nodded to Mark Loring, who brought\r\nforth his oboe. "These songs were not conceived or composed in the form\r\nI am presenting them," he said. "But I believe that the arrangement I\r\nuse is an effective one.\r\n\r\n"I call this, \'Song of the Last Men\'." He nodded again to Loring, and\r\nthe performance began. His voice was affecting, and his artistry\r\nunmistakable. And there were overtones in his voice that gave an added\r\neeriness to the weird music itself.\r\n\r\nThe songs told of the feelings, the memories, and despair of a\r\nnearly-extinct people--one which had achieved a great culture and a\r\nworld-wide civilization. The singer knows that the civilization has been\r\ndestroyed; that the people created by this culture and civilization are\r\ngone, the few survivors being pitiful fellaheen, unable to rebuild or\r\nbring forth a culture of their own. There is despair at the loss of the\r\ncomforts the civilization they knew brought them, sorrow at their\r\ninability to share in its greatness--even in memory; and a resigned\r\ncertainty that they are the last of the race--they will soon be gone,\r\nand no others shall arise after them.\r\n\r\nThere was silence when Fayliss finished, then discreet but firm\r\napplause, as if the audience felt that giving full reign to their\r\napproval would make an impious racket. Fayliss seemed to sense this\r\nfeeling, and smiled as he bowed.\r\n\r\n"These are not songs of your people, are they?" asked Jocelyn.\r\n\r\nFayliss shook his head. "Oh no--they are far removed from us. I am\r\nmerely an explorer of past cultures and civilizations, and I enjoy\r\nadapting such masterpieces of the past as I can find. This arrangement\r\nwas made for you; I shall make a different one for my own people, so\r\nthat the sonic values of the music and the words agree with each other."\r\n\r\nKutrov blinked, then asked him--"Well, can you tell us something more\r\nabout the people who created this cycle? It has a familiar ring to it,\r\nyet I cannot tie it in with any past culture I have heard of.

"\r\n\r\nJocelyn cut in with the regretful announcement that Mr. Fayliss had\r\nanother appointment, and called for a note of thanks to him for coming.\r\nMore applause--this time unrestrained. Fayliss smiled again and swept\r\nhis eyes around us, as if filled with some amusing secret. Then he said\r\nto Kutrov, "You would find them quite understandable."\r\n\r\nI wandered over to the window, in search of air, and noted that someone\r\nhad indiscreetly left a comfortable chair vacant. I was near the door,\r\nso that I could hear Jocelyn say to Fayliss: "It was--very moving. Why,\r\nI could almost feel that you were singing about us."\r\n\r\nFayliss smiled again. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
"That is as it should be."\r\n\r\n"Of course," chimed in Loring, who\'d come up to ask Fayliss if he could\r\nhave a copy of the score, "that\'s the test of expert performance."\r\n\r\nThe lights were dimmed again by the fog of tobacco smoke, and I could\r\nsee the street quite clearly by moonlight. I decided I would watch\r\nFayliss, and see if his eyes did glow in the dark. I saw him go down the\r\nsidewalk, with that graceful stride of his, his hands in his pockets.\r\nBut I couldn\'t see his eyes at all.\r\n\r\nThen a gust of wind tugged his hat, and, for an instant I thought he\'d\r\nhave to go scrambling after it. But, quick as a rapier thrust, a tail\r\ndarted out from beneath his dress coat, caught the hat, and set it back\r\nupon his head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Future combined with Science Fiction\r\n    Stories_ September 1951.
