]\r\n\r\n\r\nI stepped back out of the gutter and watched the tight clot of men\r\ndisappear around the corner. They hadn\'t really been menacing, just had\r\nmade it obvious they weren\'t going to break up. And that I had better\r\nget out of their way. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
I got. We were well trained.\r\n\r\nThe neon of the bar across the street flickered redly on my uniform.\r\nI watched the slush trickle off my boots for a while, then made up my\r\nmind and headed into the bar. It was a mistake.\r\n\r\nNew York had always been considered safe for us. Of course there were\r\nmany parts of the country that were absolutely forbidden "for your own\r\ngood" and others that were "highly dangerous" or at least "doubtful."\r\nBut New York had always been a haven. The stares there had even been\r\nadmiring sometimes, especially in the beginning.\r\n\r\nBut things had changed. I had realized that about half an hour after\r\ntouchdown, when we were being herded through Health Check, Baggage\r\nCheck, Security Check ... you know the lot. Before, there had been\r\nfriendly questions, genuine interest in the Mars colony, speculations\r\nabout the second expedition to Venus, even a joke or two. This time\r\nthe examiners\' only interest seemed to be in fouling us up as much as\r\npossible. And when we finally got through the rat race, New York was\r\nbleak.\r\n\r\nI should have stayed with the rest, I guess, and of course a public\r\nbar was the last place any smart spaceboy would have gone to. But I had\r\nsome nice memories of bars, memories from the early days.\r\n\r\nThe whole room went silent, as though a tube had blown, when I shoved\r\nthrough the door. I got over to an empty table as quickly as I could\r\nand inspected the list of drinks on the dispenser. This one had a lot\r\nof big nickel handles sticking up over the drink names and the whole\r\njob was shaped like one of those beer kegs you used to see pictures of.\r\nWhat I mean is, this was an _authentic_ bar.\r\n\r\nPhony as hell.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom the way this sounds, you can guess the kind of mood I\'d gotten\r\nin. The noise had picked up again right after I sat down and some\r\nof the drunker drunks were knocking the usual words around, in loud\r\nwhispers and with lots of glances at me. One of the pro-girls (her hair\r\nwas green and her blouse covered her breasts--another change while I\r\nwas out) gave me a big wink and then jabbed the man next to her and\r\nsquawked with laughter.\r\n\r\nI fed a bill into the change machine at the table and then dribbled\r\nseveral coins (prices had gone up too) into the dispenser.\r\n\r\nI guess I must have had several, because after a while I began to feel\r\ncheerful. The noise that was coming out of the box in the corner\r\nstarted to sound like music, and I got to tapping and rocking.

And\r\nsmiling, I guess. And that\'s what triggered it.\r\n\r\nPeople had been coming and going, but mainly coming. And the crowd at\r\nthe bar had been getting louder, and one guy there had been getting\r\nlouder than the rest. All of a sudden, he slammed down his glass and\r\nheaded for my table. He orbited around it for a while, staring at me,\r\nand then settled jerkily down in the chair across from me.\r\n\r\n"Why all the hilarity, spaceboy? Feeling proud of yourself?"\r\n\r\nHe looked pretty wobbly and pretty soft and pretty old. And very angry.\r\nBut I was kind of wobbly myself by that time. And anyway there are\r\nstrict rules about us and violence. _Very_ strict. So I just tried to\r\nmake the smile bigger and said, "I\'m just feeling good. We had a good\r\nrun and we brought in some nice stuff."\r\n\r\n"Nice stuff," he said, kind of mincing. "Buddy, do you know what you\r\ncan do with your sandgems and your windstones?"\r\n\r\n"We brought back some other things too. There was a good bit of uranium\r\nand--"\r\n\r\n"We don\'t need it!" He was getting purple. "We don\'t need anything from\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"And maybe _we_ don\'t need you." I was getting sort of fired up\r\nmyself. "Carversville is self-sufficient now. You can\'t give us\r\nanything."\r\n\r\n"Well, why the hell don\'t you stay there? Why don\'t all of you stay off\r\nEarth? There\'s no place for you here."\r\n\r\nI could have pointed out that we brought things that Earth really\r\nneeded, that Mars and Venus had literally worlds of natural resources,\r\nwhile Earth had almost finished hers. But he began to quiet down then\r\nand I began to feel the loneliness again, the sense of loss. You can\'t\r\ngo home again ... that phrase kept poking around in my skull.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he sat up and looked straight at me, and his eyes really\r\nfocused for the first time. "What lousy luck. What incredibly lousy\r\nluck. And how could anyone have known?"\r\n\r\nIt wasn\'t hard to peg what he was talking about. "It was probably\r\n_good_ luck that the first space crew was selected the way it was," I\r\nsaid. "Otherwise you\'d have had a dead ship full of dead men and no\r\nknowing why. But that one man brought the ship back."\r\n\r\n"Yeah, yeah.

I know. And the scientists figured everything out. About\r\nradiation in space being lethal to almost all types of man. But there\r\nwas one thing that made a man immune. One thing."\r\n\r\n"The scientists tried to find a protective covering that would be\r\npracticable. They tried to synthesize slaves that would protect you.\r\nIt wasn\'t our fault that they couldn\'t."\r\n\r\n"No, not your fault." His eyes had begun to dull again. "Just a matter\r\nof enough melanin in the skin. That\'s all...." Then he straightened up\r\nand slammed his fist on the table. "Damn you, did you know I was a jet\r\npilot a long time ago? Did you know I was going to be one of the space\r\npioneers? Open up brave new worlds for Man...."\r\n\r\nHe sat there staring at me for a minute or so and the last thing he\r\nsaid was, "Don\'t you come here again--nigger."\r\n\r\nI got up and left the table and walked out of the bar. I wasn\'t\r\nprovoked. As I said before, we were well trained.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first time I realized where I was was when I bumped into the fence\r\naround the spacefield. I must have walked all the way over there from\r\nthe bar. I had a memory of crumbling buildings and littered streets.\r\nThings had changed while I had been out there. They were letting the\r\ncity run down.\r\n\r\nAs I started to walk along the fence to the gate, I saw the ship\r\ntowering against the stars. The stars and the ship. And tomorrow there\r\nwould be colonists getting aboard.\r\n\r\nI stopped and looked till I knew where home was and who the real exiles\r\nwere.\r\n\r\nI stopped feeling sorry for myself. And started feeling sorry for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
