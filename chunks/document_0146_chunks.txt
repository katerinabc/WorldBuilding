One instant the big Earth-Venus rocket\r\nfreighter was sizzling through the fog to a perfect landing on the\r\nfield below. Then suddenly she dipped, undershot the field and vanished\r\nin a flash and a thundering explosion that shook the observation tower.\r\n\r\nIn the dream-like quiet that followed, Dan Kearns heard the faint yells\r\nof the landing crew. He saw the big searchlights switch on, cutting\r\nwide swaths of light through the boiling fog. Tiny white-coated medics\r\ncrossed the patches of light, running frantically. Dan sat down in the\r\nchair feeling sick and very tired. Then the door of the tower room\r\nopened and Rawlins, the supervisor, stepped in.\r\n\r\n"All right, Kearns," he said curtly, "you\'re through. And if anyone\r\nasks me about your ability as an electronics engineer, I\'ll write out\r\nthe blackest recommendation I can think of.

"\r\n\r\nDan got up slowly. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
"How many were killed?"\r\n\r\n"Two!" Rawlins glared. "Two of my best pilots!"\r\n\r\nDan\'s shoulders stiffened. "Listen, Rawlins, I\'m just as interested as\r\nyou in breaking Roehm\'s monopoly on Earth-Venus rockets."\r\n\r\n"Get out!"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t get out. Don\'t forget you have another rocket due in twenty\r\nminutes--a passenger rocket."\r\n\r\nRawlins\' face went pale. "My God! I\'d forgotten." He threw up his\r\nhands. "Turn \'em back," he shrieked. "Send \'em back to earth! It\'s\r\nsuicide to land on that guide beam."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t send them back to Earth," Dan said quietly. "They haven\'t\r\nenough fuel."\r\n\r\n"Then send \'em to one of Roehm\'s fields. It\'s an admission of complete\r\ndefeat, but we can\'t kill \'em."\r\n\r\nDan swallowed. "You\'re forgetting that Roehm uses invisible light for\r\nlanding--not ultra short waves. Anyway, do you think Roehm would miss\r\nsuch a chance to crash one of our rockets?"\r\n\r\nRawlins sat down with a groan. "Where in thunder did I ever get the\r\nidea we could bring in a ship through that magnetic murk on ultra short\r\nwaves?"\r\n\r\nDan lifted his head. "There\'s nothing the matter with my guide beam. It\r\nbrought in the experimental rocket yesterday and magnetic conditions\r\nwere even worse."\r\n\r\n"I see." The smile on Rawlins\' lined face was cynical. "In other words\r\nyou\'re trying to pass the buck to Stevens, your control-room operator."\r\n\r\nThe door of the observation room swung open and a wild-eyed mechanic\r\nburst in.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Rawlins, the control-room is still locked. Stevens is sitting in\r\nfront of the table and he won\'t answer us."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDan tore down the stairs and across the catwalk two steps ahead of\r\nRawlins. He hammered on the door. Through the thick glass he could see\r\nStevens hunched over the lighted control table.\r\n\r\n"Stevens! Stevens!" 

=== Chunk 5 ===
He turned to Rawlins. "We\'ll have to cut the lock.\r\nGet a torch--and get a doctor!"\r\n\r\nIt took a minute with a high torch before they crashed into the room.\r\n\r\n"He\'s been dead several minutes," the doctor said as he took his hand\r\nfrom Steven\'s forehead.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry, Kearns," Rawlins said. He looked at the doctor. "Well, I\r\nguess that explains everything. He must have lost control just as she\r\nwas coming in. What was it? Heart attack?"\r\n\r\nThe doctor shook his head. "Some sort of convulsion. Muscles violently\r\ncontracted. Funny he didn\'t fall to the floor. Must have affected the\r\nwhole nervous system. Even the eye pupils are down to pin points." He\r\nlooked around at Rawlins. "I may be sticking my neck out, sir, but off\r\nhand I\'d say Stevens was killed."\r\n\r\n"Killed?" Rawlins blinked at the form in the chair. "But that\'s\r\nimpossible. The door was locked. The room hasn\'t been disturbed and\r\nthere aren\'t any holes in the glass. Nothing could get in here except\r\nlight."\r\n\r\nDan walked to the big windows. He examined the ledge and the joints.\r\nHe came back to the control table and tested the switches. Suddenly he\r\nleaned over Stevens\' huddled body and pulled the log book from under\r\nhis stiff fingers.\r\n\r\n"Look at this!"\r\n\r\nScrawled across the pad in big jerky letters were the words "_Purple\r\nlight bea_...." The pencil had torn through the sheet in a violent\r\nfinal contraction.\r\n\r\nRawlins rubbed his chin. "We don\'t use any purple beams. It doesn\'t\r\nmake sense.

=== Chunk 6 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Maybe it does," Dan said. He turned to the doctor. "Wasn\'t there\r\nsome experiments made by a Dr. Aren Linden several years ago on the\r\ninjurious effect of certain kinds of light on the nervous system?"\r\n\r\nThe doctor frowned. "Yes, I think there was, but the experiments were\r\nnever completed."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right. The foundation refused to up his salary, so he went to\r\nwork for Roehm." Dan swung around to Rawlins. "It was Linden who helped\r\nwork out the invisible light landing system that Roehm uses on his\r\nVenus rocket ports."\r\n\r\n"Seems to me you\'re jumping to some pretty wild conclusions, Kearns,"\r\nRawlins said slowly.\r\n\r\nDan looked at him. "Suppose Linden has found the exact wave-length\r\nof the most potent ray. It would be simple for anyone to climb the\r\nframework of one of the buildings and shine that light in here."\r\n\r\nRawlins straightened up. "I\'ll search every tower on the field."\r\n\r\n"But you haven\'t time. That passenger rocket will be here in five\r\nminutes."\r\n\r\nThe supervisor sucked in his breath. "What\'s your idea?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll sit at the control table myself. You can do the preliminary\r\nlocating in the observation tower." He ran to the door. "Where\'s the\r\nwelder that cut the lock?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe doctor and a medic were carrying out Stevens when he came back a\r\nfew seconds later. Dan was slipping on the welder\'s helmet.\r\n\r\n"Keep everyone away from the control-room level," he said to Rawlins.\r\n"And you better have the crash trucks and the flame quenchers standing\r\nby on the field."\r\n\r\nRawlins stared at him. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
"And what happens to you?"\r\n\r\nDan licked his lips. "I--I don\'t know. I\'m going to try something."\r\n\r\nRawlins smiled. He reached out his hand. "Good luck, Dan," he said. He\r\nclapped him on the shoulder.\r\n\r\nWhen they were gone, Dan dropped the helmet over his face. He walked\r\nslowly across the room with his hands in front of him like a blind man.\r\nFinally he lifted up across the room with his hands in front of the\r\nhelmet and knocked out the dark glass in the eye slot. Then he slipped\r\nit back on. From one of the drawers in a small desk beside the control\r\ntable he lifted out a small rectangular object and slipped it in his\r\npocket. He seated himself before the control table.\r\n\r\nThe dials on the edge of the table glowed dimly. In the center of the\r\nflat top was a large circular graph with white lines that pulsed like\r\na network of capillaries. He looked across the table through the big\r\nwindow. Everything except one nearby tower was hidden in swirling mists.\r\n\r\nThe speaker at his side clicked on. He heard Rawlins\' voice. "I picked\r\n\'em up Dan. They\'re coming in at minimum speed--seventy point two nine\r\nfive degrees. I didn\'t mention the freighter."\r\n\r\nDan flicked a small switch on the table edge. A straight white line\r\nof light shot out across the graph, then swung slowly back and forth\r\nthrough an arc of ten degrees like a searching feeler. Suddenly it\r\nsteadied and an orange bead appeared at its terminus. Dan watched the\r\nbead travel down the line, across the pulsing capillaries. He reached\r\nout and grasped a small lever sticking out of the table top. As he\r\npressed the lever to one side, the line moved around the graph like\r\na pointer, carrying the orange bead with it. He watched it till the\r\nbead reached the center of the graph, and then glanced up through the\r\nwindow. Above the far end of the field he could discern the dim orange\r\nglow of a rocket\'s keel jets.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he jerked back his head. A beam of purple light was playing\r\nback and forth across the table. It swept over his gloved hands, across\r\nhis arms and chest, and moved upward toward his face. He jumped up,\r\nkeeping hold of the lever and studied the angle of the small beam. The\r\nreflection on the dark cloth of his jacket was making him dizzy. He\r\nreached into his pocket....\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Suddenly ... a beam of purple light!_]\r\n\r\nFrom the observation tower Rawlins watched the rocket sweep toward the\r\nfield with keel jets blazing. As it reached the strip it seemed to\r\nfalter and dip. Rawlins clenched his hands and swore. Then it steadied\r\nand slid in to a perfect landing.\r\n\r\nThe intercommunication telaudio flashed on. He saw Dan Kearns\' haggard\r\nface under the uplifted welder\'s helmet.\r\n\r\n"Rawlins. The roof on tower three. Check it right away. I think...."\r\nKearns\' body abruptly went rigid; he fell across the control-room table.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDan Kearns came to on the floor of the control-room with the doctor\r\nworking over him.\r\n\r\n"How do you feel?" the doctor asked.\r\n\r\n"Like I\'ve been sitting in an electric chair."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll be all right," the doctor said. "Compared to Stevens you got a\r\nmild dose."\r\n\r\nDan looked around him. He saw Rawlins\' boots and glanced upward. "Did\r\nyou check the tower?"\r\n\r\n"Yep, we found him--dead. Just like Stevens. He was one of Roehm\'s men\r\nall right. He had a flashlight. We tried it on one of the doc\'s white\r\nrats." Rawlins shook his head. "Stevens must have gone through hell."\r\nSuddenly he stared down at Dan. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
"But how...?"\r\n\r\nDan smiled. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
He lifted up his gloved hand. In it was a small rectangular\r\nsignaling mirror.\r\n\r\n"I reflected it right back at him."\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
