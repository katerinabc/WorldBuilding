]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sun was a shrunken red disk against the starfields, a distant\r\npale luminosity surrendering to the encroachment of the falling night.\r\nHoarfrost crunched under Marley\'s feet as he walked by the still black\r\nwaters of the canal, and then thin wind whispered over the sand and\r\nacross the breasts of the ancient hills. Starlight gleamed in the dark\r\nwater as the day faded. Earth hung low in the sky, like an emerald\r\npendant over the bosom of a sleeping woman.\r\n\r\nMarley pulled his silks and furs closer about his shoulders. The air\r\nwas sharp and cold. His breath froze wraithlike in the icy evening as\r\nhe hurried down the path toward Tydore\'s tower.\r\n\r\nThe green planet shone like a beacon in his eyes. Home. The thought\r\nbrought impatience and a longing to walk again under a pale sky and a\r\nwarm sun. He looked about him with faint distaste. This peace--this\r\nsolitude of low red hills and blue-black nights--was alien to Marley.\r\nIt was unreal. Mars was a dream. An ancient wasted slumbering dream.\r\n\r\nMarley\'s lips compressed as he thought of Tydore and their last\r\nmeeting. It seemed that Tydore laughed at him. Tydore withheld too\r\nmuch, and there was so little time left. There was an acrid core\r\nof decadence in the old Martian, Marley thought. A consciousness\r\nof too many millenia of civilization and decay. Devious was the\r\nword, perhaps, though it seemed a pallid one for the reality of the\r\nMartian\'s intricate mind. It was always impossible to know what he was\r\nthinking--how much he knew. About Marley being a spy. About the war on\r\nEarth. In spite of himself, Marley smiled. It sounded so melodramatic\r\nthat way, but it was the way it really was. The Martians held the\r\nperfect weapon. Marley needed that weapon, and his nation had put forth\r\na gigantic effort to get him to Mars so that he might steal it.\r\n\r\nTydore\'s tower loomed up before him in the fading light, a fey\r\nfilligree of minarettes and graceful flying buttresses too delicate\r\nfor a grosser world than Mars. The tower\'s reflection shimmered in the\r\nstill dark waters of the canal like an alter ego extending deep into\r\nthe liquid depths.\r\n\r\nMarley descended the steps of delicately wrought stone that led to the\r\ntower\'s underground entrance with care, for the drifted ferric sand\r\nmade them treacherous. How like the Martians, he thought with some\r\nirritation, to make it necessary to travel down in order to enter a\r\ntower. Everything the long way, the hard and devious way.\r\n\r\nThe outer doorway was shaped like a fleur-de-lis and it opened from the\r\ntop down, sliding into a recess of ancient, oily machinery. It would\r\nbe far too simple to make a door that looked and worked like a door.\r\nEverything Marley had seen during his months on Mars served only to\r\nincrease his sense of alienage. He had seen only Tydore, of course, of\r\nthe living Martians. There were only a handful left and they lived\r\nin their isolated towers along the still canals surrounded by their\r\ntissue-thin manuscripts and ancient, reedlike music spools that filled\r\nthe air of their retreats with skeins of weird and enharmonic melody.\r\n\r\nThe weapon was Tydore\'s. He had rebuilt it from plans drawn by some\r\nensorcelled armorer dead over five thousand years. Rebuilt it in the\r\nparadoxical way that Martians seemed to do everything, for if there was\r\none thing that no Martian needed it was a weapon. No strife had marred\r\nthe planet\'s peace for millenia. But build it he had, and Marley\'s\r\nhands itched for the sleek deadliness of it--the smooth grained stock,\r\nthe oddly wrought, ornate muzzle. There was a vicious, tangy violence\r\nfrozen into every line of the weapon. And it was the only hand gun\r\nMarley had ever seen that chained the forces of the atom. With such\r\nweapons an army could be invincible.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTydore stood to greet him. With the elaborate courtesy of his kind, he\r\nperformed the ritual gestures of welcome, his slender, finely veined\r\nhands tracing the ancient symbols in the air.\r\n\r\n"The gods of sand and wind have brought you safely to my house, man\r\nof Earth. I give thanks and pray you find peace and wisdom within my\r\nwalls."\r\n\r\nThe old Martian\'s chanting voice was like the fluting grace of a\r\nScarlatti choral. It was one with the miniscule paintings that covered\r\nthe walls, the finely wrought carvings on the antique flagstones under\r\nhis feet. Marley was not at home in the fluid Martian tongue, but the\r\nvery sound of the words conjured for him the serried ranks of spectral\r\ngenerations that had reached their culmination in this one robed\r\nancient.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, he thought with irritation, Tydore\'s words mean not at all\r\nwhat they said. Through the finely polished phrases of welcome ran\r\na thread of hidden mockery--even hate--for Marley and everything he\r\nrepresented. Never once had Tydore, by word or deed, indicated that he\r\nfelt anything but friendship for his visitor from the silvery ship out\r\non the desert, and yet there was no mistaking the nuance of contempt.\r\nTydore despised Marley as an outworld savage. One with the despoilers\r\nof the holy places of Mars.\r\n\r\nNot that the Martians had gods. They had lived too long for that, and\r\ntheir deities existed only in their beautifully turned phrases and\r\ntheir hyper-cultured ritual. But the first men from Earth had looted\r\nthe libraries and shattered the soaring towers. It was a thing no\r\nMartian would ever forget--or forgive. It marked Earthmen for what\r\nthey were. In Martian eyes--precocious barbarians. Targets for Martian\r\nsubtlety.\r\n\r\n"I give thanks for your welcome," Marley said slowly, his tongue clumsy\r\non the singing syllables.\r\n\r\nTydore inclined his head slightly and indicated that Marley should\r\nfollow him up the winding ramp that pierced the core of the tower. Each\r\ntime Marley came, the ritual was the same, as unchanging as the still\r\nwaters of the dark canals or the frozen loneliness of the red hills\r\nbeyond. They would pass the first level, where the old engines supplied\r\nTydore with what little heat and sustenance he needed. They would go on\r\nto the second level, where the music spools lay in ordered confusion\r\namid the sonic transcribers that Tydore used to weave the sounds of the\r\nMartian night into atonal poems of melody. And then they would reach\r\nthe level of the weapon.\r\n\r\nIt would still be in its crystal case, guarded by a lock of bronze. A\r\nlock to which there was one key, and that one key on a silver chain\r\naround Tydore\'s neck. They would pass the weapon by and seek the top\r\nlevel, a platform shielded against the frigid night by a crystal\r\ncanopy. And there they would begin their nightly fencing with words and\r\nideas under the guise of friendship.\r\n\r\nMarley\'s heart was pounding suddenly as he drew near to the weapon. His\r\npatience was failing him at long last, he knew. He was sick of Mars,\r\nsick of Tydore. Sick of posing as a humble seeker after knowledge. If\r\nhe could not trick the Martian into parting with the weapon soon, he\r\nknew that he must chance violence. He had not dared it before, because\r\nhe could never be sure that Tydore and his kind were as defenseless as\r\nthey seemed. It was paradoxical that they should possess a weapon such\r\nas _the_ weapon and yet be unwilling or unable to use it.\r\n\r\nStill it seemed to Marley that such must be the case. He could only\r\nexplain it to himself by saying that they had lived too long, amid\r\ntoo much deviousness and inverted purpose to be quite virile. They\r\nwere--the word came readily to mind from the days of his training on\r\nEarth--decadent. And the meek did not inherit the earth or anything\r\nelse, he told himself with satisfaction. Only the militant, the\r\nruthless.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe time had come, Marley thought, for the calculated risk. Direct\r\naction. He could scarcely contain himself as they passed the weapon and\r\nclimbed to the top level.\r\n\r\n"You seem preoccupied tonight, Marley," Tydore said, pouring two tiny\r\ngoblets of wine, "Can it be that you grow tired of Mars?"\r\n\r\nMarley sipped the wine thoughtfully. To him it seemed completely\r\ninsipid and without flavor. Subtlety again? 

=== Chunk 3 ===
He doubted it. "I mean to\r\nask a favor of you, Tydore," he said, "And I but ponder how I should\r\nbegin."\r\n\r\n"My house is yours," the Martian replied softly, "And all that it\r\ncontains."\r\n\r\nMarley\'s eyes narrowed. Did he imagine the accent on the last phrase,\r\nor was it actually there? He decided to be very cautious. "I came here,\r\nas you know," he said, "To learn everything I might about your kind. As\r\nyou know, we of Earth are a young race, still much in need of guidance\r\nand knowledge."\r\n\r\n"You have learned much," Tydore said.\r\n\r\nMarley\'s tone grew harder. "But not enough."\r\n\r\nTydore\'s eyebrows arched delicately. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
"So? You have read my books,\r\nlistened to my music. You have tasted the wines and eaten the fruits of\r\nMars. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
You have seen the stars and the sand, the waters and the lichens.\r\nHave you not known my world?"\r\n\r\n"I want more," Marley said flatly.\r\n\r\nTydore smiled. In that smile Marley saw a flash of more distilled\r\nvenom and ancient hatred that he could have imagined existed. The utter\r\nvirulence of it left him shaken and his illogical fear brought anger.\r\n\r\nHe got to his feet, the tiny goblet in his hand. It was old and\r\ndelicate, a tiny gem of carved jade and ivory. To one such as\r\nTydore--priceless. Brutally, Marley crushed it to shards in his hands\r\nand dropped it to the flagstones. The fragments tinkled as they fell.\r\n\r\n"So it must always be," said Tydore in a soft voice.\r\n\r\n"I have not come here to listen to music, Tydore," Marley said, "Nor to\r\nread your books or to know your world. You have one thing that I want.\r\nYou will give it to me, or I will take it from you." He ground his heel\r\nonto the remains of the goblet with a grating sound.\r\n\r\n"The weapon," the Martian said, "You want the weapon. You may have it.\r\nYou need not have broken my goblet...."\r\n\r\nMarley was almost sorry that he had won so easily. He suddenly wanted\r\nto crush the old Martian as he had crushed the goblet. In both there\r\nwas a quality that eluded him, and it was maddening.\r\n\r\nTydore handed him the key. "Come, we will get it together."\r\n\r\nMarley followed him cautiously, alert for any trickery. Presently they\r\nstood before the case and Marley unlocked it, reaching greedily for\r\nthe polished stock. He cradled the gun in his arms lovingly, savoring\r\ntriumph. With this in his hands, he could defy a world.\r\n\r\n"There is no other like it, nor any but I to make one," Tydore said\r\nwith a strange smile.\r\n\r\n"Why did you make it?" asked Marley.\r\n\r\n"I made it for you."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "_I made it for you...._"]\r\n\r\nMarley laughed aloud. It was an alien sound in the thin, cold air of\r\nthe tower. "You\'re a liar, Tydore. You built this weapon long before I\r\never left Earth and you know it."\r\n\r\n"By you, I meant simply men like you," Tydore said. "When the first\r\nEarthmen came and befouled Mars with their presence, I knew that I\r\nmust make the weapon." He smiled, showing even white teeth. "A small\r\ntriumph, but things are not to be measured by whether they are great\r\nor small. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Rather by their flavor, their grace, and their neatness,\r\nMarley."\r\n\r\n"You speak of triumph, old man," snorted Marley derisively, "while your\r\nprecious weapon is in my hands."\r\n\r\nTydore shrugged. "As I knew it would be one day when I spread the tales\r\nof what the weapon would do. It drew you as a lodestone draws a sliver\r\nof iron."\r\n\r\nMarley felt a pang of panic. "You mean this thing is a fake?"\r\n\r\nTydore shook his head. "No counterfeit. It will do what I said it would\r\ndo. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Kill. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
What more can one ask of a weapon?"\r\n\r\nIt was Marley\'s turn to smile. "Nothing. And there is only this one.\r\nAnd if you were to die...."\r\n\r\nTydore smiled a veiled smile. "It is as the gods of sand and wind\r\ndecree."\r\n\r\nMarley pointed the weapon at Tydore. He had only to kill the old\r\nMartian and return to his ship. The mission was over. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
Completed. He was\r\ndone with Mars and with Tydore and his subtle scorn.\r\n\r\nHe cradled the weapon lovingly, laying his cheek to the carven stock.\r\nOld Tydore had built well. There was perfect balance in the feel of\r\nit. His finger curled around the trigger and he sighted carefully down\r\nthe long barrel at the robed figure of the Martian. Tydore was smiling\r\nin the face of death, and Marley wanted to laugh out loud. This is the\r\nway the world ends, he was thinking. Not with a bang but a whimper. He\r\nsqueezed the trigger....\r\n\r\nThe universe exploded in Marley\'s face. There was a streak of searing\r\npain that carried away half his face, and as he fell he could hear a\r\nstrange sound. For the first time, Tydore was laughing aloud. It was a\r\nhideous sound. A voice for the torment and hatred of a race that had\r\nlived too long, planned too much. Marley felt the tower pinwheel around\r\nhim, the flagstones leapt up to meet him, greeting the searing agony of\r\nhis face with the soundless laughter of a million intricate patterns of\r\nlonely death. And blackness welled up out of the stones to engulf him,\r\nbut not before he knew--\r\n\r\nTydore had made the weapon with the muzzle resembling the stock. It was\r\nas simple as that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
