T. Oliver\r\n\r\n                Smith made a profitable business out of\r\n             murder. It was all quite simple--he killed a\r\n              man and then disposed of the body--forever!\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Imagination Stories of Science and Fantasy\r\n                              March 1952\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sign on the door said Ernest H. Smith, Private Investigator.\r\nThe door opened and a woman came in. She was a brunette, about\r\nfive-feet-two, wearing a yellow dress with black buttons. She carried a\r\nbrown alligator handbag. "I am Mrs. Wilma Rogers," she said. "You were\r\nrecommended to me."\r\n\r\nSmith motioned to a chair in front of his desk. "Sit down, Mrs. Rogers.\r\nDo you have a card?"\r\n\r\nShe sat down and opened her handbag. She took out a small card and\r\nhanded it to him. He looked at the printed words, "Recommended to\r\nSmith." He opened a desk drawer and removed a small bottle of red\r\nliquid, spilling a few drops on the blank side of the card. Soon there\r\nwas visible writing on it.

"Okay for any service," it said.\r\n\r\n"All right," Smith nodded, "what can I do for you?"\r\n\r\n"I want you to kill my husband," she said pleasantly.\r\n\r\nSmith swiveled his chair around to face the typewriter, inserted a\r\nblank sheet of white paper, and began to type. "Why do you want him\r\nkilled?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s stingy--he won\'t give me enough money."\r\n\r\n"How much money will he leave you, Mrs. Rogers?"\r\n\r\n"Roughly two hundred thousand," she said. "There\'s insurance, of\r\ncourse, but I understand we can\'t count on that."\r\n\r\nSmith smiled. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
"That\'s a nice sum. Now what time would be most\r\nconvenient?"\r\n\r\nShe shrugged her shoulders. "Any time suits me."\r\n\r\nSmith laughed. "I mean for your husband. What time would be best for\r\nkilling him?"\r\n\r\n"Oh," she said. Her brow wrinkled and she began to mutter, "Let\'s see,\r\nnow ... home at five-fifteen, reads the paper ... takes a shower ...\r\ndinner at six-fifteen ... I can send the servants out at\r\nseven-thirty ... oh, I think eight will be perfect."\r\n\r\n"Eight it is," said Smith, putting the information on paper. "Now for a\r\nbit of information about the house and grounds. Can\'t afford to bungle\r\ninto the wrong place and foul up the job."\r\n\r\nMrs. Rogers opened her purse again and withdrew a folded sheet of\r\npaper. "I\'ve got a floor-plan of the house here, with the address and\r\neverything marked off."\r\n\r\nSmith took the paper and looked at it. "You don\'t overlook anything, do\r\nyou? Why didn\'t you just go ahead and do the job yourself?"\r\n\r\nShe smiled and shrugged. "I understand you can perform a perfect\r\nmurder. I\'m afraid I couldn\'t."\r\n\r\nSmith removed the typewritten sheet from the machine and inserted a\r\nfresh sheet. He filled it in with names, dates, and figures. When he\r\nfinished he handed it to her. "Sign on the bottom line."\r\n\r\nShe took the paper and looked at it.\r\n\r\n"It\'s our contract," said Smith. "I have to have a guarantee that\r\nyou\'ll go through with your part of the bargain. If you don\'t, I\'ll\r\nhave that signed confession."\r\n\r\nMrs. Rogers looked at him in silence for a moment, then she laughed and\r\nsigned the paper. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
"You don\'t overlook anything, yourself."\r\n\r\n"No, Ma\'am," said Smith.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt exactly five minutes before eight, Smith drove his panel truck\r\nthrough the gate to the Rogers home, turned out the lights, and drove\r\nsilently to the house. He parked near the side entrance, got out, went\r\naround the truck, which was labeled, "Smith\'s TV Repair," and opened\r\nthe back doors. He lifted a pile of ragged quilts from the floor and\r\npicked up a small air-pistol. Wrapped carefully in the quilts was a\r\ntiny bottle of dark green liquid, marked "Poison." He took a small\r\ndart from his pocket, opened the bottle and applied a small amount of\r\nthe liquid to the tip of the projectile. Then he loaded the pistol with\r\nthe dart, stuck it in his coat pocket, and replaced the bottle.\r\n\r\nHe walked rapidly to the door of the house, stopped at the steps to\r\nconsult the floor-plan, and then entered. He went up the stairs and\r\ndirectly to the second door on the left. He turned the knob silently\r\nand eased inside.\r\n\r\nA small man, dressed in a dark suit, was seated at a desk, writing with\r\na fountain pen on light blue paper. He looked up and said, "Who are\r\nyou?

=== Chunk 5 ===
"\r\n\r\n"I\'m Smith, the TV repairman--are you Rogers?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but I--"\r\n\r\nThen Smith killed him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe emerged from the house with Rogers draped over his shoulder and\r\nstaggered over to the truck. He shoved the corpse in and crawled in\r\nafter. Moving rapidly, he opened the door of a trim metal cabinet\r\ndirectly behind the cab and shoved Rogers inside. Then he pushed a\r\nbutton on the side of the contraption and it began to hum.\r\n\r\nAfter two minutes he cut the power and opened the cabinet. It was empty.\r\n\r\nSmith whistled softly as he walked back to the house. He strode noisily\r\nin and called, "Hey, Mrs. Rogers!"\r\n\r\nShe emerged from a door near the head of the stairs and came down.\r\n"Yes?" she said.\r\n\r\nSmith grinned at her. "It\'s okay, lady--the job is over."\r\n\r\n"Good! Let me fix you a drink, and you can tell me all about it."\r\n\r\nSmith sat down on a couch. She prepared the drinks and brought his\r\nover. They sat together and sipped the liquor.\r\n\r\n"Science is wonderful," she said.\r\n\r\n"Yeah, it sure is," said Smith. "They spend millions figuring out fancy\r\nways to catch crooks, and then some dumb professor invents a way so I\r\ncan kill people and never be caught."\r\n\r\n"I wonder what the cops a hundred years in the future will think when\r\nbodies start popping up all over the place?" she observed.\r\n\r\n"Who cares?" 

=== Chunk 6 ===
said Smith. "I\'m making my dough, even if I will have to\r\nwait seven years for the heirs to collect."\r\n\r\n"It won\'t be too hard to wait," she said, "since we know for certain\r\nwe\'ll get it."\r\n\r\n"Let\'s drink to our success," Smith said.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s," she smiled.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s to a fine old professor, who invented a time machine and\r\nkindly let me kill him and take it away. Here\'s to a policeman\'s\r\nnightmare--the perfect murder."\r\n\r\nThey drank.\r\n\r\nSmith got to his feet then and put the glass down. "Well, I\'ve got to\r\ngo now, I--"\r\n\r\nHe saw the blank look of astonishment on her face. Her mouth had\r\ndropped open and her eyes were wide, staring. But they weren\'t looking\r\nat him--they were looking _behind_ him.\r\n\r\nAnd then he heard the polite cough.\r\n\r\nSmith spun around. He stared in amazement at the figure of a man\r\nstanding there. A man clad in a strange shimmering metallic uniform.\r\nThe man held an odd-looking weapon in his hand. He was smiling.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Smith, I believe?"\r\n\r\nSmith nodded automatically. "Yes, but who--"\r\n\r\n"--am I?" the stranger completed the sentence for him. "It\'s quite\r\nsimple. I\'m Inspector Graevod, homicide. I\'m arresting you for murder."\r\n\r\nSmith shook his head dully. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
"But that\'s impossible. There\'s no\r\nmurder--no body.... Where did you come from?"\r\n\r\nThe shimmering man smiled pleasantly. "Oh but there is a body. Matter\r\nof fact there are quite a few. We\'ve had quite a bit of difficulty in\r\ntracing you down. I\'ve come all the way from 2035 to find you." He\r\nturned his eyes to the woman. "As an accessory to the fact you are also\r\nunder arrest. Come along, both of you."\r\n\r\nHe pointed the strange weapon at them and a silver radiance swept from\r\nit to envelope their bodies.\r\n\r\nBut only for a moment. Then they were gone....\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
