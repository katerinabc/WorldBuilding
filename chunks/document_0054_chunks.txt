However, let\'s kibitz for a moment ..._\r\n\r\n\r\nFIELD TRIP\r\n\r\nBy Gene Hunter\r\n\r\n\r\nKial was disgusted with the slow, cumbersome train. He disliked using\r\nthis uncomfortable means of travel, but since he wanted to learn more\r\nabout these strange creatures who were his ancestors, he had decided to\r\ntry to become used to their ways.\r\n\r\nHe was lonely in this strange, backward age and when he unexpectedly saw\r\nanother being like himself in the same coach, he hastened to make his\r\npresence known. He introduced himself and asked politely:\r\n\r\n"When are _you_ from?"\r\n\r\n"8000," the other replied. "Name\'s Broyk, from VII Galaxy."\r\n\r\n"I\'m from out XIX way myself," Kial said. "Just a country boy. But\r\n8000--that\'s only a period ahead of my own time. Maybe you could tell\r\nme ..."\r\n\r\n"Ah, ah!" 

=== Chunk 2 ===
the other admonished. "Remember the First Law of Thek!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Center," Kial grumbled. "I know: \'One may not divulge any\r\nscientific, technical or social information to anyone from his own past\r\nwhom he may meet at an equidistant point in a Thek-travel.\' I forgot."\r\n\r\n"Bad," Broyk said. Then he added, almost jokingly: "You wouldn\'t want to\r\nbe marooned in this dismal era, would you?"\r\n\r\nKial shuddered. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
"Of course not. But the Laws seem so ridiculous."\r\n\r\n"Not a bit," Broyk said, warming up to the subject. "It\'s very simple,\r\nreally. Same principle that doesn\'t allow anyone to Thek-travel into the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n"Look. I\'m from 8000. Say that I went into 12,000, where I memorized as\r\nmuch information as I could on some subject such as medicine. So I\r\nreturn to 8000, retaining all such knowledge in my mind that\'s been\r\nlearned in four periods. Therefore, I\'d have knowledge that wasn\'t\r\ndreamed of in my own time, but was discovered sometime during the next\r\nfour periods. But then it couldn\'t be discovered, because I\'d brought\r\nit back to 8000 and--well, I\'m no Logician, but you see my point."\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s reasonable, I suppose," Kial admitted. "I realize the Laws are\r\nreally for our own good. By the way--I\'m here on a field trip to gather\r\nmaterial for my thesis on Advanced Therapeutical Psychology and its\r\ndevelopment since the Twentieth Century. What phase of this era are you\r\nhere to study?"\r\n\r\n"I--I\'m afraid I couldn\'t tell you that," Broyk said. "It\'s of rather a\r\nsecret nature and ..."\r\n\r\n"You mean we might violate a Law and be stuck here for good--is that\r\nit?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--in a way."\r\n\r\nFrightened, Kial let the matter drop. His gaze wandered through the\r\ncoach, examining the other passengers with interest. As time-travelers\r\nfrom a different space-time plane from their 20th Century ancestors, he\r\nand Broyk were naturally invisible to their fellow travelers.\r\n\r\nTwo pompous old gentlemen were lighting cigars and Kial was about to\r\nremark on the habit of smoking when he noticed an even more remarkable\r\nphenomenon. A few seats ahead of them sat a good-looking young couple,\r\noblivious to others about them.\r\n\r\n"Look!" Kial cried excitedly. "Lovers! Honeymooners! I\'ve read about\r\nsuch things! Isn\'t it disgusting?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know," Broyk said, a little wistfully. "I sometimes think\r\nit was a mistake for Center to do away with sex. It must have been\r\ninteresting."\r\n\r\n"Atavist!" Kial snapped in horror.\r\n\r\nHad his people\'s emotional make-up provided for blushing, Kial would\r\nundoubtedly have turned beet-red. Broyk\'s words had caused him acute\r\nembarrassment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs he sat reflecting upon his strange companion, he suddenly began to\r\nfeel a sensation he had often heard about but never before had\r\nexperienced. Terror and dismay filled him as he sought to throw off the\r\nprobing finger that was penetrating his mind.\r\n\r\nHe looked at Broyk. There was the faintest notion of a smile on the\r\nother\'s face as he said: "Yes, Kial--I am a Telepath."\r\n\r\nKial\'s mind reeled. He felt himself on the brink of some gigantic abyss\r\nand then, as suddenly as it had come, the searching sensation faded\r\naway.\r\n\r\n"Since you are unable to enter my mind," Broyk said calmly, "it\'s only\r\nfair that I tell you about myself. You were right--I\'m an atavist. Even\r\nin period 8000, such things can happen. Always such creatures are\r\ndestroyed after their first psychotests, but my case was different.\r\nThe Controller who bred me was only a dabbler in such things. I\r\nwas a failure, but he took a fancy to me. I was allowed to mature\r\nsecretly--few people knew of my existence. When I reached my majority my\r\npresence became dangerous and I was sent back into time to try and find\r\nthe proper place for myself. And I think I\'ve found it--here!"\r\n\r\nKial was a very amazed young man. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
"But such a barbarous age," he\r\ncomplained. "Sex and atom bombs and everything ..."\r\n\r\n"Remember," Broyk smiled, "these people are the forebears of the\r\ngeniuses who created Center and the Galactic Empire. They\'ll survive,\r\ndespite their barbarism. The existence of Center is proof."\r\n\r\n"It\'s rather horrible to contemplate," Kial said thoughtfully, calmer\r\nnow, "and yet, this might really be a great age. In a way I almost envy\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Of course you do," Broyk said. "You have certain tendencies--they\r\nbother you, although you manage to hide them well. I discovered them\r\nwhen I took the liberty of telepathing you. Artificial Genetics isn\'t\r\nperfect, even in our time--perhaps because we originally sprang from\r\nman. Perhaps we\'ll never be quite perfect, because of that, even after\r\nthousands of periods of breeding."\r\n\r\nKial took another look at the loving young couple. "It--it might be fun,\r\nafter all."\r\n\r\nBroyk laughed. "You needn\'t envy me at all, you know."\r\n\r\nKial frowned.\r\n\r\n"I\'m telling you about myself," Broyk went on, "I have also told you of\r\na specific condition existing a period ahead of your own time. Remember\r\nthe First Law?"\r\n\r\n"Center!"\r\n\r\n"We\'re marooned in the Twentieth Century. You have to accept it.

=== Chunk 5 ===
"\r\n\r\n"But what will we _do_?" Kial\'s mind was reeling again.\r\n\r\n"Since we\'ve already broken the First Law," Broyk said, "we may just as\r\nwell break the Second: \'No Thek-traveler may enter the body of a native\r\nof a foreign space-time ...\'"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe young lovers kissed again and this time there seemed to be an added\r\nzest, even to their passionate embrace.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _If Worlds of Science Fiction_ May\r\n    1953.
