While the rocket moved inexorably toward\r\nEarth--an immense silver needle threading the dark fabric of space--he\r\nwaited calmly through the final hours, knowing that the verdict was\r\nabsolute, that hope no longer existed.\r\n\r\nElectronically self-sufficient, the ship was doing its job perfectly,\r\nthe job it had been built to do. After twenty years in space, the ship\r\nwas taking Robert Murdock home.\r\n\r\nHome. Earth. Thayerville, a small town in Kansas. Clean air, a shaded\r\nstreet, and a white, two-story house at the end of the block.\r\nHome--after two decades among the stars.\r\n\r\nSitting quietly before the round port, seeing and not seeing the\r\nendless darkness surrounding him, Murdock was remembering.\r\n\r\nHe remembered the worried face of his mother, her whispered prayers for\r\nhis safety as he mounted the rocket ramp those twenty years ago; he\r\ncould still feel the final, crushing handshake of his father moments\r\nbefore the outer airlock slid closed. His mother had been 55 then, his\r\nfather 63. It was almost impossible to believe that they were now old\r\nand white-haired.\r\n\r\nAnd what of himself?\r\n\r\nHe was now 41, and space had weathered him as the plains of Kansas\r\nhad weathered his father. He, too, had labored as his father had\r\nlabored--but on strange, alien worlds, under suns far hotter than Sol.\r\nMurdock\'s face was square and hard-featured, his eyes dark and deep\r\nunder thrusting ledges of bone. He had changed as they had changed.\r\n\r\nHe was a stranger going home to strangers.\r\n\r\nCarefully, Murdock unfolded his mother\'s last letter, written in her\r\nflowery, archaic hand, and received just before Earth take-off.\r\n\r\n    _Dearest Bob,_\r\n\r\n    _Oh, we are so excited! Your father and I listened to your voice\r\n    on the tape over and over, telling us that you are coming home to\r\n    us at last. We are both so eager to see you, son. As you know, we\r\n    have not been too well of late. Your father\'s heart does not allow\r\n    him out much any more, and I have had a few fainting spells over\r\n    the past month. But Doctor Thom says that we are all right, and you\r\n    are_ not _to worry. Just hurry home to us, Bob. We both pray\r\n    God you will come back safely._\r\n\r\n                                                         _All our love,\r\n                                                                Mother_\r\n\r\nRobert Murdock put the letter aside and clenched his fists. Only brief\r\nhours remained to him, and the small Kansas town of Thayerville was an\r\nimpossible distance across space. He knew he would never reach it alive.\r\n\r\nThe lines of an ancient poem by Robert Frost whispered through his mind:\r\n\r\n    But I have promises to keep,\r\n    And miles to go before I sleep\r\n\r\nHe had promised his parents that he would come home--and he meant to\r\nkeep that promise.\r\n\r\nThe doctors had shown him that it was impossible. They had charted his\r\ndeath; they had told him when his heart would stop beating, when his\r\nbreathing would cease. Death, for Robert Murdock, was a certainty. His\r\nalien disease was incurable.\r\n\r\nBut they had listened to his plan. They had listened, and agreed.\r\n\r\nNow, with less than a half-hour of life remaining, Murdock was walking\r\ndown one of the ship\'s long corridors, his boot-heels ringing on the\r\nnarrow metal walkway.\r\n\r\nHe was ready, at last, to keep his promise.\r\n\r\nMurdock paused before a wall storage locker, twisted a small dial.\r\nA door slid smoothly back. He looked up at the tall man standing\r\nmotionless in the darkness. Reaching forward, Murdock made a quick\r\nadjustment.\r\n\r\nThe tall man stepped down into the corridor, and the light flashed in\r\nhis deep-set eyes, almost hidden behind thrusting ledges of bone. The\r\nman\'s face was hard and square-featured.\r\n\r\n"My name is Robert Murdock," said the tall figure in the neat patrol\r\nuniform. "I am 41 years of age, a rocket pilot going home to Earth." He\r\npaused.

"And I am sound of mind and body."\r\n\r\nMurdock nodded slowly. "Indeed you are," he said.\r\n\r\n"How much longer do you have, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Another ten minutes. Perhaps a few seconds beyond that," replied\r\nMurdock.\r\n\r\n"I--I\'m sorry," said the tall figure.\r\n\r\nMurdock smiled. He knew that a machine, however perfect, could not\r\nexperience the emotion of sorrow, but it eased him to hear the words.\r\n\r\nYou will be fine, he thought. You will serve well in my place and my\r\nparents will never suspect that their son has not come home to them.\r\n\r\n"It must all be perfect," said Murdock.\r\n\r\n"Of course," said the machine. "When the month I am to spend with them\r\nis over they\'ll see me board a rocket for space--and they\'ll understand\r\nthat I cannot return to them for another twenty years. They will accept\r\nthe fact that a spaceman must return to the stars, that he cannot leave\r\nthe service before he is 60. Let me assure you, sir, it will all go\r\nwell."\r\n\r\nYes, Murdock told himself, it _will_ go well; every detail has been\r\nconsidered. My voice is his voice, my habits his own. The tapes I have\r\npre-recorded will continue to reach them at specified intervals until\r\ntheir death. They will never know I\'m gone.\r\n\r\n"Are you ready now, sir?" the tall figure asked gently.\r\n\r\nMurdock drew in his breath.

"Yes," he said, "I\'m ready now."\r\n\r\nAnd they began to walk down the long corridor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMurdock remembered how proud his parents had been when he was finally\r\naccepted for Space Training--the only boy in Thayerville to be chosen.\r\nBut then, it was only right that he should have been the one. The other\r\nboys, those who failed, had not _lived_ the dream as he had lived it.\r\nFrom the moment he\'d watched the first moon rocket land he had known,\r\nbeyond any possible doubt, that he would become a rocketman. He had\r\nstood there, in that cold December of 1980, a boy of 12, watching the\r\ngreat rocket fire down from space, watching it thaw and blacken the\r\nfrozen earth. He had known that he would one day follow it back to the\r\nstars, to vast and alien horizons, to worlds past imagining.\r\n\r\nHe remembered his last night on Earth, twenty long years ago, when\r\nhe had felt the pressing immensity of the vast and terrible universe\r\nsurrounding him as he lay in his bed. He remembered the sleepless hours\r\nbefore dawn, when he could feel the tension building within the single\r\nroom, within himself lying there in the heated stillness of the small,\r\nwhite house. He remembered the rain, near morning, drumming the roof,\r\nand the thunder roaring powerfully across the Kansas sky. And then,\r\nsomehow, the thunder\'s roar blended into the deep atomic roar of a\r\nrocket, carrying him away from Earth, away to the burning stars ...\r\naway ...\r\n\r\n_Away._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe tall figure in the neat patrol uniform closed the outer airlock\r\nand watched the body drift into blackness. The ship and the android\r\nwere one; two complex and perfect machines doing their job. For Robert\r\nMurdock, the journey was over, the long miles had come to an end.\r\n\r\nNow he would sleep forever in space.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the rocket landed, the crowds were there, waving and shouting out\r\nMurdock\'s name as he appeared on the silver ramp. He smiled and raised\r\nhis hand in salute, standing there tall in the sun, his splendid dress\r\nuniform reflecting the light in a thousand glittering patterns.\r\n\r\nAt the far end of the ramp two figures waited. An old man, bowed and\r\ntrembling over a cane, and a seamed and wrinkled woman, her hair\r\nblowing white, her eyes shining.\r\n\r\nWhen the tall spaceman reached them they embraced him feverishly,\r\nclinging tight to his arms.\r\n\r\nTheir son had returned. Robert Murdock had come home from space.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Well," said a man at the fringe of the crowd, "there they go."\r\n\r\nHis companion sighed and shook his head.

"I _still_ don\'t think it\'s\r\nright somehow. It just doesn\'t seem right to me."\r\n\r\n"It\'s what they wanted, isn\'t it?" asked the other. "It\'s what they\r\nwrote in their wills. They vowed their son would never come home to\r\ndeath. In another month he\'ll be gone anyway. Back for another twenty\r\nyears. Why ruin it all for him?" The man paused, shading his eyes\r\nagainst the sun. "And they _are_ perfect, aren\'t they? He\'ll never\r\nknow."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you\'re right," nodded the second man. "He\'ll never know."\r\n\r\nAnd he watched the old man and the old woman and the tall son until\r\nthey were out of sight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
