GROW\r\n\r\n                  The moment is at hand--the fingers\r\n                 are poised--this is what comes next!\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\r\n               Worlds of If Science Fiction, March 1963.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n10 years of uneasy peace, since the Hour of Tragedy ... ten\r\napprehensive, uneasy years pungent with fear, with hatred, distrust ...\r\nten years like ten thousand in the past of man ... ten units out of the\r\ninfinite, out of time the eternal, immutable, nonexistent dimension....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n9 planets spinning ... nine spawn of the sun, one of them nascent, a\r\nhairsbreadth from its heritage. But which heritage? It could choose.\r\nThe fertile warmth of the parent star ... or the star's pure fire?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n8 periods, in the gibberish of the sifters of chaos ... eight:\r\nPre-Cambrian to Triassic--while flame cooled and became stone and lay\r\nlatent, lambent, pent awaiting release--before from the fetid Jurassic\r\ndarknesses the beasts of warm blood crawled.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n7 seas, once the womb of life, then too long its caul ... the common\r\nbirthplace, then a strangling wall between. (Once too, briefly a\r\nhigh road for the courageous, now a new kind of night for marauders,\r\nshadowed shapes armed with pieces of the sun.

)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n6 masses of land, cradles for the genesis of a myriad species ...\r\nand one of them Man. Man the Creator, the Protector, the Destroyer:\r\nbuilder of shrines, burner of saints, good father, good soldier, good\r\nkiller.... Man, the creature of choice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n5 nations remaining, sparse ruddy fruit of a thousand wars, nurtured by\r\na billion dead. Five, the bloody consequence of union into pack, into\r\ntribe, into fief, to kingdom, empire and nation. The threads of history\r\ngathered finally into five flags, entwined in alliance at this point in\r\ntime by a searing wind: Pan-American, Sino-Russian, Afro-Arabian ...\r\nracial armies, sons of the first beast to kill from anger, fathers of\r\nthe unborn. Armies in the terrible truce of the fusion bomb ... waiting.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n4 farflung networks: metal wire and machines, and vacuum. Interlinked\r\nwebs of detection and retaliation or attack, within the webs bombs ...\r\nwithin the bombs targets, mapped and doomed by a spark. Each alliance\r\na network of aimed and armed missiles, in deserts, on mountaintops,\r\nhidden deep and in the surrounding seas. Each alliance a pattern of\r\ntargets, always an instant from obliteration.\r\n\r\n(Such had come to Britain in its Hour of Tragedy when the last savage\r\nhope of Empire Regained dissolved into vapor, and the Isles became\r\nslag. There the fourth network corroded under a shroud of ash; but the\r\nsurviving three ceaselessly hummed.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n3 men, of one species but riven somehow at this point in time by\r\npigment, tongue and details of dress: a man from Brownsville, a man\r\nfrom Vladivostok, a man from Khartoum ... buried deep in the hearts\r\nof the networks, each already entombed, and so safe from death. Each\r\nchosen by his masters to be the nock of the arrow, the final factor;\r\nyet not an arrow, for each network of course was aimed at both the\r\nothers. A moment's trust is fatal once the truce is broken, the masters\r\nreasoned, and so the bombs and the men were trained.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n2 buttons, a choice under the fingers of each of these men: one, red,\r\nto loose deliberately the double pronged torrent of bombs if the\r\nmasters so decreed. The other, white, to cancel the launching command\r\nbroadcast automatically if massive radiation spewed across the\r\nhomeland ... a vast, vicious death reflex. Each man, then, if the\r\ndetectors tolled, had the decision: error or attack.

Fail or be unable\r\nto press the white instantly, and the counter-attack, if such it was,\r\nbegan. This, then, was the masters' last concession to the human\r\nfactor, their grudging one to humanity.\r\n\r\nAnd like most of the masters' concessions to the masses, it was false.\r\nIdentically, in each network, the white button was a dummy. The real\r\nchoice was as it always was--red button, kill ... or wait yet a while\r\nmore. The men in the tombs, unknowing, knew this was the choice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1 man's brain, whosoever, however carefully masters may mold it, is\r\na fragile thing. Ten thousand years have not fitted man to live with\r\nhimself; could a single man live with the lives of two billion? The\r\nchoice, distillate of a hundred centuries of pain, the weariness of a\r\nspecies with race: blame them, blame all. One of the men sitting in a\r\ncold tomb sweated. His finger hovered over the red button, trembled ...\r\nand fell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
