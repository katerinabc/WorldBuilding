They\r\nwere addressed to Captain Johnny Martin of the spaceship 13-XV-1, which\r\nis my name and my ship.\r\n\r\nThey said:\r\n\r\n_Proceed to Aldebaran VII at once. You are to pick up an Aldebaranian\r\nambassador and transfer him to Earth for high-level diplomatic talks._\r\n\r\n_You are to treat him with utmost courtesy. Relations between Earth and\r\nAldebaran VII are in a very delicate state at this time._\r\n\r\n_The ambassador informs us he plans to bring a pet with him to Earth._\r\n\r\nPets, huh? I snorted a little and folded the orders away in my pocket.\r\nWell, I supposed it came in the line of duty. If they ordered me to\r\nferry Aldebaranian pets, I\'d ferry Aldebaranian pets. All in a day\'s\r\nwork, I told myself.\r\n\r\nI stopped off and had a couple of beers before returning to the ship.\r\nMeersal, my First Officer, was waiting for me.\r\n\r\n"Well? Pick up the orders?

"\r\n\r\nI nodded. "Yep. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Got \'em right here." I unfolded them and handed them\r\nover to him.\r\n\r\nHe ran his eyes over them quizzically. "Hokay," he said. "I guess we go\r\nto Aldebaran, huh?"\r\n\r\nOur instructions came in detail a little while later. We were to hover\r\nover Aldebaran VII and give a special signal; a transfer-tug would come\r\nup to us from the surface and hand the Ambassador and his pet over to\r\nus. Under no conditions were we to land on Aldebaran VII itself; the\r\nnatives would regard it as a breach of the truce that currently existed\r\nbetween their world and ours.\r\n\r\nOkay, I thought. I didn\'t care.\r\n\r\nI gave the orders to the crew at nightfall and we left Earth a little\r\npast midnight. Meersal had already instructed the astrogator about our\r\nnext destination and he had whipped up the course.\r\n\r\nWe did some hundred thousand miles on ion-drive and then, safely clear\r\nof the Earth\'s grav-field, converted over and popped into warp.\r\nAldebaran lay three weeks ahead of us through hyperspace.\r\n\r\nEarth and Aldebaran had first contact about 10 years before. I didn\'t\r\nknow anything particular about the planet or its people--there are\r\nenough worlds in the galaxy so you don\'t get to know each type of\r\nalien there is. We had a special cabin ready aboard the ship for the\r\nAldebaranian ambassador and his pet. Instructions told us to prepare a\r\nspecial fluorine atmosphere, which meant the Aldebaranians couldn\'t be\r\nmuch like us.\r\n\r\nBut they had agreed to negotiate a treaty of friendship with Earth and\r\nwere sending an ambassador. That was good news, I thought.\r\n\r\nWe popped out of warp right on schedule and there was the giant hazy\r\nred sun that was Aldebaran, staring us right in the face. It seemed to\r\nfill the entire sky.\r\n\r\nOur astrogator plotted a course rapidly for Aldebaran VII, which was\r\nthen at perihelion and a good ways across the heavens from where we\r\nwere. The Aldebaran system is a huge one--31 planets spread out over\r\nsix or seven billion miles of space.\r\n\r\nMost of them were dead worlds, though. It was only Aldebaran VII that\r\nhad any sort of intelligent life, or so our survey teams reported.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt took three days more to get within hailing distance of the seventh\r\nplanet. It spun beneath us, a pretty blue-green ball about the size of\r\nEarth.\r\n\r\nWe came within about a million miles and set up an orbit as per\r\ninstructions. No sooner had we done that than we found ourselves\r\nsurrounded by a flock of alien warships.\r\n\r\nI went to the radio room and made contact.\r\n\r\n"State name and object here," I was ordered in a crisp, business-like\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n"I\'m Johnny Martin, Captain of the Terran vessel 13-XV-1, with no\r\nhostile intent. We\'re here to pick up an ambassador from Aldebaran to\r\nEarth, along with his pet."\r\n\r\nI heard some hasty conferring going on and then someone said, "Hold on,\r\nTerran ship. We\'ll check with the home planet."\r\n\r\nFive tense minutes passed--minutes in which I half expected to be\r\nblown out of the sky by a sudden attack. You never can tell with\r\naliens. They\'re likely to do almost anything; their psychologies are\r\nunpredictable in Terran terms--as, I guess, ours are in theirs.\r\n\r\nBut finally my receiver crackled and the alien voice said, "Everything\r\nis clear, 13-XV-1. Remain in orbit and ambassador will be transferred\r\nto your ship. Any suspicious move on your part will bring immediate\r\nattack by our defense fleet."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t worry. I\'m not going any place. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
I\'ll wait right here."\r\n\r\nI watched in the viewscope as a small ship bellied upward from the\r\nblue-green world below and approached us. They matched velocities with\r\nus, airlock to airlock.\r\n\r\n"Get that fluorine room ready," I ordered my men. "The Ambassador\'s\r\ncoming aboard."\r\n\r\nThe two ships hung side by side in space. Of course, there was no\r\napparent relative motion since we had the same velocity. It was\r\npossible to walk back and forth from their ship to ours.\r\n\r\n"Prepare to receive Ambassador," came the message from the other ship.\r\n"His excellency, Quelf Tharkol, Minister Plenipotenitiary--and his pet."\r\n\r\n"I\'m ready," I said. "Our airlock\'s open."\r\n\r\nSlowly the lock of the other ship slid back and two space-suited\r\nfigures appeared--the Ambassador, Quelf Tharkol, and his pet. The\r\nAmbassador was invisible within his spacesuit but he stood upright and\r\nlooked to be about the size of a man. I was happy about that; it\'s\r\nalways a lot easier to negotiate with a humanoids-type alien than with\r\nsomething totally bizarre.\r\n\r\nI chuckled when I saw the space-suited cat--for so I thought of it.\r\nIt was cat-size, in a little form-fitting spacesuit, and it scampered\r\nafter its master on four legs, space-suited tail wagging behind. It was\r\nsort of a cute little thing, I thought; no wonder its master didn\'t\r\ncare to leave it behind.\r\n\r\n"Everything all set?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Transfer is completed," said the captain of the other ship. He closed\r\nhis lock, and pulled away from us.\r\n\r\n"Close the lock!" I ordered.\r\n\r\nI gestured to a crewman standing by. "Show the Ambassador to his room,"\r\nI said.\r\n\r\nWhen the Ambassador and his pet were in their special fluorinated\r\nstateroom I called them on the special television hookup I had set up\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nThey had taken their spacesuits off and were lying sprawled out in\r\ntheir green murky atmosphere, the Ambassador in his bunk and the pet\r\nin his. I could hardly see into the room over my circuit but I could\r\nsee that the Ambassador was very human and that the pet was pretty much\r\nlike a cat, except that he had sharp-clawed fingers instead of the soft\r\nlittle pads a cat has.\r\n\r\n"Everything all right in there?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Fine, just fine. How long will it take to get to Earth?"\r\n\r\n"About three weeks," I said. "We\'ll be going into warp any minute."\r\n\r\n"Very well," came the reply.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI didn\'t expect to have many dealings with the Ambassador. I had\r\nbeen told that he would have his own food supply and naturally he was\r\nconfined to his fluorinated stateroom. So we settled down to a pleasant\r\nreturn trip.\r\n\r\nBut on the second day of warp I was awakened from sweet dreams by\r\nWhitey Durbin, the Night Engineer. He shoved me around in my bunk until\r\nI opened one eye and said "Whatsamatter?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s the cat, Chief!"\r\n\r\n"Cat? What cat? You crazy, Whitey? Lemme go back to sleep."\r\n\r\nBut he was obstinate. "The Ambassador\'s pet. It\'s out of its room."\r\n\r\n"Huh? But it can\'t breathe--"\r\n\r\n"It\'s wearing a spacesuit. And it\'s wandering all over the ship,\r\nsnooping around. I caught it in the drive section and up front with the\r\ncharts. I don\'t like it, Chief."\r\n\r\n"No. Neither do I." 

=== Chunk 5 ===
I was wide awake all at once. There had been\r\nsomething fishy about this pet business all along and now I was\r\nsuspicious. Suppose the pet were a little smarter than a cat? Suppose\r\nit was snooping around innocently enough--and actually soaking up vital\r\nsecret information about the workings of a Terran spaceship?\r\n\r\nBut I didn\'t know what to do. My orders stressed the fact that I had to\r\nhandle the Ambassador with kid gloves--but on the other hand, was I\r\nsupposed to let that creature roam all over the ship?\r\n\r\n"Get me a hookup with Home Base," I said. "And in the meantime keep an\r\neye on that cat. Don\'t let it catch wise but try to follow it around.\r\nAnd _don\'t_ stop it from roaming. These aliens may be touchy about the\r\nfunniest things."\r\n\r\nI got in touch with Home Base in jig time. Commander Mahoney was the\r\nman I spoke to.\r\n\r\n"How\'s that Ambassador, Martin?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s why I\'m calling, sir. You see--the Ambassador\'s pet is creeping\r\nall around the ship. It\'s sort of a cat but I wonder whether maybe it\'s\r\ndoing a very neat job of spying on us."\r\n\r\n"Have you taken any action yet?"\r\n\r\n"No. I wanted to check with Home Base."\r\n\r\nMahoney thought for a moment. "I suppose it would be all right to\r\nspeak to the Ambassador about this and tactfully request that he keep\r\nthe creature in his own quarters. But be _tactful_ about it, Martin.\r\nRemember, we don\'t want to offend these aliens."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was the middle of the "night" aboard ship, so I didn\'t think it\r\nwould be particularly tactful to call the Ambassador just then.\r\n\r\nI waited until morning, by which time my men reported that the cat had\r\ncompleted its survey and had promptly returned to the Ambassador\'s room.\r\n\r\nWhen the television came on, the Ambassador and his pet were again\r\nreclining leisurely on their bunks.\r\n\r\n"Sorry if I\'m disturbing you," I said hesitantly.\r\n\r\n"That\'s quite all right. What can I do for you?"\r\n\r\n"A matter of shipboard procedure I\'d like to point out. It seems last\r\nnight your pet left your cabin and explored the ship, or so some of\r\nmy men reported. I\'d appreciate it if you\'d restrain the animal to\r\nquarters from now on. It upsets shipboard routine--and, besides, my\r\ninstructions request that I keep the operating sections of the ship\r\nunder security wrap."\r\n\r\nThere was silence for a moment. I held my breath, hoping I hadn\'t\r\nsaid something wrong, some thing that might foul up the delicate\r\nEarth-Aldebaran negotiations in progress.\r\n\r\nFinally came the reply. "I understand fully. I\'m sorry about the\r\nexploration trip--it was mere curiosity. It won\'t be repeated. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
But\r\nyou\'re mistaken about one thing.

=== Chunk 7 ===
"\r\n\r\n"What\'s that?" I asked somewhat puzzledly.\r\n\r\n"My pet remained in the cabin all night. _I_ was the one who explored\r\nthe ship." There was a sneer in his voice.\r\n\r\n"You? But--"\r\n\r\nMy mouth clammed shut. And then I understood. I couldn\'t keep the flush\r\nof embarrassment from my face and he saw it over the screen. It seemed\r\nto please him. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
Pretty damned clever, I thought. Smart psychology for\r\nthe aliens to bring a "human" as a pet, putting our diplomats on the\r\ndefensive right from the start. The Ambassador must have known what I\r\nwas thinking for the sneer grew on his face.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly I grinned. It seemed to surprise him. This, he hadn\'t\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\n"Captain, something strikes you as humorous?" There was uncertainty in\r\nhis tone. Plus a little annoyance.\r\n\r\nMy grin widened. "Just a little private joke, Ambassador," I said. I\r\nwas thinking that this joker was in for a shock. Two planets could play\r\nat this game and I would have plenty of time to tip off Home Base.\r\n\r\nAfter all, we have pets too....\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
