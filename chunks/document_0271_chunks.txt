=== Chunk 2 ===
]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe land was dark in the softly falling rain, and the smell of green\r\nthings was in the air. The crew huddled in their cloaks and peered into\r\nthe approaching dusk as they unloaded the great silver space ship.\r\nThey were apprehensive of the stark ruins that began barely a mile from\r\nthe ship, the ruins that seemed to sprawl interminably across the flat\r\nland beside the broad river.\r\n\r\nIn the metal headquarters hut, the commander glanced nervously at his\r\nchronometer. The astrogator looked up from his interminable reckonings\r\nand smiled.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t worry, captain," he said. "They\'ll be all right. After all, we\r\nhaven\'t seen any life but a few small animals. And they ran from us."\r\n\r\nThe commander nodded absently, but went to the open door and stared out\r\ninto the rain. It made a musical tinkling on the thin metallic dome of\r\nthe hut.\r\n\r\n"I know," he said. "Perhaps that\'s why I\'m worried. It\'s the feeling of\r\ndeath here, as though it might spring at us from some corner in those\r\nruins.... I should have sent out a stronger scout party."\r\n\r\nThe astrogator shrugged and returned to his log. "If anything had gone\r\nwrong, they would have messaged us."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe commander smiled an unwilling agreement, but he stayed in the open\r\ndoor, searching the gathering darkness toward the city. He could not\r\nshake loose from the feeling of doom that had settled on him as soon\r\nas they had made their landfall and clambered from the airlocks of the\r\nspaceship. This was a strange world, the commander thought to himself.\r\nIt seemed to have everything--everything but intelligent inhabitants.\r\nThey had circled it for two days before they had chosen this wide green\r\nvalley for their landfall. They had seen cities, many of them, great\r\ncities along seacoasts and in rich plains, cities in mountains and in\r\nvalleys, but nowhere had they seen life.\r\n\r\nThe first cautious explorations after the landing that morning had\r\nshown that there was plenty of good water. The soil seemed rich, and\r\nvegetation grew in profusion, even among the ruins they had warily\r\nskirted. The atmosphere was perfect ... it was what they had searched\r\nfor through the long bitter years ... this stable atmosphere with\r\nits abundance of life-giving oxygen. And minerals aplenty ... the\r\nburned and blasted metal skeletons of the ruined city showed that. The\r\ncommander told himself that he was a fool for worrying, when he should\r\nbe shouting with joy at his luck.\r\n\r\nThere was a shout from the outpost, a laugh, and then his\r\nsecond-in-command loped through the rain, smiling broadly. Behind him\r\nwere the others, laughing and joking, shrugging their packs to the\r\nground. Gladness and wonder were in their faces and their voices, and\r\nthe commander knew that this was the world they had sought for so long.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant ducked into the doorway and paused to warm himself at\r\nthe little thermal unit. He wiped the rain from his face, reached for\r\nthe wine bottle beside the astrogator\'s work board, and tilted it.\r\n\r\n"This is it, sir," he said. He was young, and Fate had been good to\r\nhim, and he was exulting in it. "It\'s everything we ever dared dream\r\nabout. It will support the whole race, every one of us, I think, if the\r\nrest of this world is anything like what we\'ve seen this day."\r\n\r\nThe commander grinned back at him, relief plain in his face. He was\r\nphrasing the message that he would send home across the void, the\r\nmessage they had waited for down through the weary years, the years\r\nthat had rolled by while the land burned up under a blazing sun, while\r\nthe water disappeared and the atmosphere became thin.... But there was\r\nstill in him the doubt, the remnant of fear....\r\n\r\n"Did you," he spaced the words carefully, "find any sign\r\nof--intelligent life?"\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant\'s smile faded. He glanced quickly out at the men,\r\nbreaking out their rations, resting from the labor, and looked back at\r\nhis captain. He nodded.\r\n\r\n"Tracks," he said. "We came across them leading out of the deserted\r\ncity."\r\n\r\n"Many?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think so. Five or six, perhaps. And we found where they had\r\nkilled one of the small animals and eaten it."\r\n\r\n"Did they seem--intelligent? 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Really, I mean?"\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant shrugged. "Who knows? 

=== Chunk 4 ===
They\'re bipeds, at any rate. We\r\nfollowed the tracks, but they had taken to a small stream bed, and we\r\nlost them.

=== Chunk 5 ===
"\r\n\r\nThe commander pondered. Then he made his decision.\r\n\r\n"In a country as large as this," he said, "five or six can\'t make any\r\ndifference to us, not even to a small party like our own. And certainly\r\nnot when the ships begin arriving from home."\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant leaned back on his pack, his face content. The commander\r\nsat at a field desk and started writing, carefully, knowing that\r\nwhat he wrote would someday be in every textbook. The message was not\r\ndifficult, really. Thousands of space captains had phrased the message\r\nin their minds down through, the years of The Search. So had he, time\r\nand again, as he lay in his bunk or watched the wheeling stars from\r\nthe bridge. In the glow of the thermal unit his stern face glowed with\r\npride and the certainty that it was his ship that had saved a world....\r\n\r\nIn another hut the scholar stared thoughtfully at the thing he had\r\nfound in the old house where they had discovered the tracks. There had\r\nbeen a language on this dead world, and in his hand he held some of the\r\nbrown mouldering pages upon which the language had been written. He\r\napplied his scholar\'s mind to the puzzle....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe city crouched grimly about them. Even though they had neither seen\r\nnor heard any life in these streets save a few small animals who had\r\nfled their coming, they gripped their projectors at the ready.\r\n\r\nAlmost every structure had been damaged. Many were mere twisted heaps\r\nof debris, timbers and girders thrusting insanely at a sky that today\r\nwas blue and benign. The taller, sturdier buildings still stood, but\r\ntheir walls were cracked and their windows gaping hollow eyes in the\r\nblank faces. Rubble clogged the streets, and grass had split the\r\npavements. Here and there among the ruins a sapling stood bravely, its\r\nroots grasping in the shattered masonry.\r\n\r\nIn the streets, rusting and ancient, were objects which they surmised\r\nmust have been vehicles. In some of them they found fragments of bone\r\nand shreds of clothing. They had seen other bones; in doorways, on the\r\nground floors of the few buildings they had penetrated.\r\n\r\n"Whatever it was," the second-in-command said, "it struck them swiftly."\r\n\r\n"Some sickness, a virus, perhaps?" the astrogator suggested.\r\n\r\nThe commander shook his head. "War," he said. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
"Only war could do this\r\nto a city."\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant said admiringly, "Whoever they were, they certainly\r\ndeveloped some pretty terrific weapons."\r\n\r\nThe commander had smiled, and patted his projector. "No more terrific\r\nthan these," he said. "Our own people developed weapons, too. Thank the\r\nstars that we have learned not to use them on each other."\r\n\r\nThe scholar looked up from the inscription he had found on the side of\r\na building.\r\n\r\n"And thank the stars," he said, "that we learned in time. The people of\r\nthis world apparently did not."\r\n\r\nIt was then, while they spoke, that from somewhere in the ruins there\r\nwas a sharp crack, and one of the crew spun around and fell in the\r\nstreet. In the shattered silence of the city the sound echoed crazily.\r\n\r\n"Take cover!" the captain shouted, and he plunged into a huge doorway,\r\npeering around the protecting portal. There was another crack, and\r\nsomething whined by him.\r\n\r\n"Projectile weapon!" 

=== Chunk 7 ===
whispered the lieutenant behind him. He was prone,\r\nsighting his projector at a half-ruined four-story house at the corner.\r\nHe pressed the control switch, once, and a section of the second floor\r\nseemed to explode into hurtling gray dust and shrieking steel.\r\n\r\nOther projectors were spitting from doorways and from behind piles of\r\nbrick and debris in the streets. The captain, watching the building\r\nfrom which the answering fire seemed to come, thought he saw movement\r\nbehind one of the blank windows. Before he could take aim, there was a\r\nripping series of shots and the masonry of the portal flew into dust.\r\nHe heard the low flat whine of ricochets, and he withdrew deeper into\r\nthe dimness of the great entranceway. Up the street he heard a crew\r\nmember cry out in pain.\r\n\r\n"The second floor!" he cried, and a hurricane of electron bolts ripped\r\ninto the building at the corner. The building seemed to rip apart\r\nunder the impact and there was the roar of falling bricks and timber\r\nas a floor gave way with a crash. They dashed out of cover, crouching,\r\nfiring as they went.\r\n\r\nThey found three bodies in the ruins. Bipeds. Pale pasty flesh, faces\r\nhalf-hidden by tangled hair. The bodies were only partially clad in\r\nfaded tattered clothes, and the feet were encased in what appeared\r\nto be the tanned hide of an animal. The flesh and the clothing were\r\nfilthy, and they stank. The bodies were huddled around their weapon, a\r\nmetallic-looking projectile-thrower mounted on three legs. Its barrel\r\nwas still hot.\r\n\r\nA little later they flushed another of the creatures in a narrow\r\nstreet. It howled gibberish at them and fled, but they cornered the\r\nthing against a heap of rubble. It mouthed things at them, and hurled\r\nbits of brick. Its eyes were wild and staring, and spittle trickled\r\ndown the face into the sodden filthy rags it wore. They had to kill it,\r\nfinally.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _They had to kill it, finally._]\r\n\r\nThe commander turned the dead thing over with his projector stock, and\r\nstared at it.\r\n\r\n"Mad," he said. "There are only a few of them, and they are mad."\r\n\r\nThe scholar nodded. He had found many of the writings, and they were\r\nstuffed in his pack and in his pockets, and he held one while he talked.\r\n\r\n"They are mad," he said, "and there cannot be many of them. Certainly\r\nnot enough to halt the advance of civilization."\r\n\r\nIt was as if he saw, already, the soaring towers of the cities they\r\nwould build here over the pitiful ruins, as though the busy highways\r\nalready spanned this rich new world.\r\n\r\n"We have won our bridgehead here," he said. "Soon we will have won the\r\nworld. The world," he looked down at the carcass at his feet, "that\r\nthese poor fools threw away."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe scholar made his greatest find late that afternoon, on the\r\nstreet-level floor of an almost-intact building. It must have been\r\na place where writings had been stored, or perhaps sold. The brown\r\nrotting pages were everywhere, and the mouldering covers in which the\r\nwritings had been bound. The scholar cried out with pleasure, and the\r\ncommander was forced to delay their return to the ship so that the crew\r\ncould carry part of the loot with them, for further study.\r\n\r\nThe scholar was squatting in a corner of the room, poring over one of\r\nthe ancient records, when he looked up and shouted, "I think I\'ve got\r\nit! I think I\'ve got it! I think I\'ve found the key to their language!"\r\n\r\nThe commander had smiled indulgently, for though he believed in\r\naction, he had respect for the scholar, and knew that the things the\r\nscholar might discover in the old writings might help him in his own\r\ntask as leader of the expedition.\r\n\r\nIt was then that the creatures attacked for the last time. They must\r\nhave crept into the building and gathered there in the dimness, waiting\r\ntheir opportunity. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
There were six of them. They poured through a rear\r\ndoor into the room of writings, howling, their projectile-throwers\r\nbarking. Their wild ululations were the screams of the demented. The\r\ncommander could see the madness in their eyes and he knew why he had\r\nbeen afraid.\r\n\r\nThe astrogator was down before they could return the fire, and then the\r\nprojectors cracked out their blue-flamed doom.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant cursed as he was hit; he dropped to one knee, firing\r\nswiftly, and then the creatures were down and it was over. The wild\r\nbearded faces were charred and blackened, and in the sudden silence was\r\nthe crackle of the little blue flames as they danced over the filthy\r\nragged clothing of the dead. The commander let his breath go, at last,\r\nin a long gasping sigh.\r\n\r\nHe started to walk toward the bodies, knowing that they were the\r\nlast, knowing that if there had been any more they would have waited,\r\ngathering strength, and they would not have made the crazy suicidal\r\nattack. The fighting was over. The savage creatures, unbalanced by\r\ntheir miserable existence among the ruins of the glory that had been\r\ntheirs, would never again threaten the bridgehead he had carved on this\r\nworld. It was his world now.\r\n\r\nThere was a frantic tugging at his sleeve, and he shook the battle fog\r\nfrom his eyes and grinned at the scholar. The commander remembered\r\nthat even while the fight had roared hot and sharp, the scholar had\r\nnot moved from his corner, nor taken his eyes from the pages he was\r\nstudying. And now the scholar was fairly dancing with excitement.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got it!" he said, almost chortling. "It wasn\'t hard with the\r\nkey--and I found the key!"\r\n\r\nHe gestured toward the little tangle of bodies, silent in the room of\r\nwritings.\r\n\r\n"They called themselves \'Men,\'" he said.\r\n\r\nThe commander shrugged.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
