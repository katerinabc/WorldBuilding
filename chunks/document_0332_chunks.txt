It gives a\r\n               definite if entirely unsuspected answer.\r\n\r\n    _Even among those who accept time travel as at least a theoretical\r\n    possibility, there exists a tendency to regard this unseen fourth\r\n    dimension as something which moves back and forth along a single\r\n    track. However, now and again some ingenious soul arises with a\r\n    suggestion that time may move in other directions as well. Not\r\n    since Murray Leinster\'s memorable "Sidewise in Time" have we met\r\n    such a scramble as this._\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n               Fantastic Universe October-November 1953.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a long way in time and dimension from his friendly home seas\r\nand the Irritant was hungry and ill-humored. The voids about him\r\nlooked cold, unrelieved by any twinkling of tasty intellect. Not even\r\nthe flicker of an edible consciousness for eons around. Crossly the\r\nIrritant baited a line and cast it in all directions. The bait was a\r\ntangled skein of thoughts about Conflict. The hook, a hard and slender\r\ncurve of sharpened Vertigo.\r\n\r\nHe began trolling through the blankness of Time....\r\n\r\nThe Major in Air Corps blues pulled a bound sheaf of papers from his\r\nsmart brief and slid them across the table. "Of course, Ed, my say-so\r\ncan pet pretty damn lost between here and the Pentagon but I think\r\nyou\'re a cinch for the job."\r\n\r\nHe plucked the short cigarette from between his thin lips and snubbed\r\nit out in the overflowing petri-dish that served as an ashtray.\r\n"And"--Major Hall cocked a speculative eye at his friend--"I can\'t\r\nthink of a better way for you to get this joint out of the red."\r\n\r\n"Quicker, you mean--not better." Ed Wilkes riffled through the\r\nspecification booklet. "Lump this for me, huh?"\r\n\r\n"Right. But first you tell me something, chum. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
Why should you, an\r\nM.I.T. honor grad--a laddie with more degrees than the Kremlin has\r\nReds--bury yourself down here in the mouldering South, presiding angel\r\nover the destiny of an insignificant little college?"\r\n\r\nHe waved his hand in an encompassing gesture that pointed up the\r\nstained lab table, the cracks in the wall and ceiling, the general\r\nair of save and make do that characterized the entire campus.\r\n"Insignificant and crumbling even when Lincoln was president."\r\n\r\n"I like Virginia," Wilkes replied. "I am not buried, I am not presiding\r\nangel but just Chair of Higher Math--and this place was new in\r\nLincoln\'s time. I have no intention of fighting the Civil War with you\r\njust now but allow me to say--as a Northerner, mind you--that the South\r\nhas done pretty good. Now sum up this sheaf of High Brass doubletalk."\r\nHe tossed the papers back to Major Hall. "First, though, let me call in\r\nMosby.

=== Chunk 3 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Who and why?"\r\n\r\nEd swiveled around and flicked a switch on an office-to-office phone.\r\n"Worked with me before the war on the argon-valve gimmick."\r\n\r\n"The what?"\r\n\r\n"A widget to help stabilize thiotimoline," he obliged with bland level\r\ngaze.\r\n\r\n"Oh."\r\n\r\nWilkes jiggled the switch again. "Hello, Doc Mosby? Wilkes. Got\r\nsomething that might interest you. Wouldst cross the hall and look in?\r\nSwell." He hung up. "You\'ll like Mosby, Pete. Smart as hell. Awful nice\r\nto work with too. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
We\'ve both got classes this summer."\r\n\r\nThe door opened and a handsome woman came in, an expectant questioning\r\ntilt to the dark wings of her brows. She was in her middle thirties,\r\nher bright blond hair tucked into a trim bun, and wore a severely\r\ntailored linen suit that almost managed to hide an interesting body.\r\n\r\n"Julie, this is Major Peter Hall. He sat out part of the war with me at\r\nWright Field. Pete, Doctor Julie Mosby. Chair of Physics, builder of\r\nvigorous martinis and good guy."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Major scrambled to his feet and took the cool hand she offered him.\r\n"Well, he_llo_! I can see why Ed left Northwestern."\r\n\r\n"You drafting him? 

=== Chunk 5 ===
I hope not." She looked from Major Hall to Wilkes to\r\nthe booklet before them. "What gives?"\r\n\r\n"Pete here," said Wilkes as they seated themselves, "bears gifts and\r\nassorted tidings. I want you to hear his yarn."\r\n\r\n"Well...." Major Hall picked up the document and ahemed. "Special\r\nTesting and Materials needs a job done. I thought Ed was the man for\r\nit, so they sent me down to talk things over.\r\n\r\n"The prize is a calculator we\'ll install and leave here and--"\r\n\r\nJulie\'s dark eyes sparkled. "Lawd, Ed! Sign up quick. A calculator! I\r\ncan see next fall\'s catalogue now. It\'ll jump enrollment thirty percent\r\nat the very least."\r\n\r\n"Yeah," said Wilkes cautiously. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
"That it might. But hear the soldier\r\nman out."\r\n\r\n"We want him and his team to come up with a nozzle lining. My guess is\r\nthat the work would be about nine-tenths sheer math and then a little\r\nfield work in New Mexico."\r\n\r\n"Nozzle, eh." Julie put her elbows on the table, her chin on her folded\r\nhands. "Flame thrower? Garden hose?" she asked brightly.\r\n\r\n"Rockets, Julie. Seems that V One and Two and the rest of their hive\r\naren\'t mean enough."\r\n\r\nMajor Hall opened the booklet and hurried on. "We need a nozzle or\r\nnozzle lining that will stand the two or three second change from\r\nnear zero to full blast temperatures. Frankly the long-range missile\r\nbusiness is up a creek. It seems there\'s a limit to the range."\r\n\r\n"Incandescence," Julie offered.\r\n\r\nThe major looked at her with new respect. "How\'d you know? They go too\r\nfar--they come down too fast. They burn up on reentering lower and\r\ndenser air. We\'ve got to slow up their approach somehow--anyhow."\r\n\r\n"And I\'ll bet you\'re going to try using nose rockets to brake with,"\r\nshe mused. "Tried carborundum with pre-heating units?"\r\n\r\n"No, we haven\'t, but.... How the hell--pardon me--did you guess about\r\nbraking rockets?" The officer glowered suspiciously. "You doing work\r\nfor the _Navy_?" He made a mild oath of the word.\r\n\r\nChuckling, Ed Wilkes put a soothing hand on the other\'s arm. "Hang on,\r\nPete--simmer down. I told you we could use Julie. You see, weapons are\r\nher hobby. Check the library lists sometime. You\'ll find a sweet work\r\nthere of hers dealing with every persuader from cross-bow to tommy gun."\r\n\r\n"To say nothing of shillelagh, arbalest and stylet," she added\r\nmodestly. "Nor of whinyard, haguebut and assagai."\r\n\r\n"Well, break me to sergeant!" The Major shook his head wonderingly.\r\n"How come a sweet little Southern thing like you got such a bloody\r\nmind?"\r\n\r\nWilkes tilted back against the wall. "Runs in her family, Pete. Ever\r\nheard of her great-uncle--John Singleton Mosby?"\r\n\r\n"Let\'s see...." Hall squinted, pursed his lips reflectively. "Something\r\nabout mobility.... Got it--Mosby\'s raiders. Couple of hundred\r\ncutthroats who operated behind Northern lines in the Civil War. Each\r\nman carried four or five pistols. Mobility plus firepower. As I recall\r\nfrom a rather dull West Point course--and that was years ago, my\r\nchildren--he raised merry hell with the Union war effort for a time.\r\nEven captured a General, didn\'t he, Ed?"\r\n\r\n"General Stoughton," Julie supplied. "And he would have snatched Grant\r\nbut peace broke out. My father used to insist that he could have won\r\nthe war for us."\r\n\r\n"If?" Hall favored her with a rather indulgent smile. "If he\'d just\r\nbeen somewhere at the right time with the right weapon. A couple of\r\nP-thirty-eights, perhaps?"\r\n\r\nJulie Mosby studied him calmly. "Hardly--a few-score Garands would\r\nhave done it. A light submachine-gun like the Thompson or the crude\r\ngrease-gun."\r\n\r\n"Grease-gun?" Wilkes slumped further back in his chair. "That\'s a new\r\none on me."\r\n\r\n"It was quite a weapon," Hall told him. "A few pieces of pipe, some\r\nsprings and other scraps. They made them in garages during the war.\r\nCrude, like Julie says, but damn mean gadgets. Light and rugged. The\r\nunderground in Europe loved them. Would have been just the thing for\r\nyour great-uncle Mosby and his crew. But as for his winning the war...."\r\n\r\nHe glanced at his watch, then jumped up. "Judas! I\'ve got to catch a\r\nplane out of here in an hour. Enjoyed talking with you, Doctor Mosby.\r\nWe\'ll get together again." He nodded his thanks. "And you, Ed? Are you\r\nin on this nozzle project?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t know." Ed Wilkes regarded Julie\'s eagerness. "Let\'s leave it up\r\nto you, Julie. I\'ll be a big thing for the school. You see, Pete, the\r\nplace is only partly State supported--Julie\'s family has been making up\r\nmost of the balance for years--and they must be weary of it. I don\'t\r\nlike the idea of bigger and better weapons--you both know me that\r\nwell--but I guess I hate what\'s with Europe and Asia even worse."\r\n\r\n"Then us ole Rebels," Julie said, "we all\'d be proud to help y\'all\r\nNawthners."\r\n\r\n"Fine." The officer stepped aside to let Julie pass first through the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s have a couple of beers with the Major, Ed. Is there time?

=== Chunk 7 ===
"\r\n\r\nHall frowned at his watch. "I suppose. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
And we can settle a couple of\r\nthe whens and wherefores of the project."\r\n\r\nThey left the Science building together, walked down the worn stone\r\nsteps and out onto the rather neglected-looking June campus.\r\n\r\n"There\'s a student beer hall about a block from here," said Julie.\r\n"Will that do, Major?"\r\n\r\n"Umm?" Hall was eyeing the rolling black sky. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
"Oh, yes--fine. Hope it\'s\r\nnot going to storm. My flight\'ll be scratched and I\'ve got to be in\r\nWashington by five at the latest." The first big drops came spattering\r\ndown. "Damn! Left my raincoat in the staff car."\r\n\r\nThe three hurried past a blighted, moss-grown statue of a wounded\r\nConfederate soldier saluting General Lee in full uniform.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the first tug of intelligence registered, the Irritant was\r\nsleeping restlessly. The second brought him out of troubled dreams. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
At\r\nthe third he hauled in. Nothing--nothing but a jumbled scattering of\r\nlow-order babble and memories and impressions. Not enough for a meal.\r\n\r\nAngrily, he examined the trashy catch--three minor intelligence--mental\r\npictures of a crude something that stored, then propelled bits of\r\nmetal forward--and.... The Irritant took more careful note--A weave of\r\nthoughts about some other intelligence called johnsingletonmosby. And\r\nclose at hand too. Just a few moves to the side, then around.\r\n\r\nThe Irritant patiently fashioned a new bait--a summary of the concepts\r\nconcerning the metallic object--the tube attached so to the middle\r\nattached so to the rest, then filled with that which coiled and slid\r\nand turned. Might be just the lure.\r\n\r\nDone! Now ... the quarry should be about ... here!\r\n\r\nOut went the bait into space-time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe ordnance sergeant, Jake Lavender, looked up from the Sharps carbine\r\nhe was repairing. "Huh?"\r\n\r\nThere was no reply.\r\n\r\nFrowning he took an oily rag and began wiping the bolt he had filed\r\ninto a better fit. Sure as thunder someone had called out the captain\'s\r\nname. Or whispered it, more like. His gaze darted about the littered\r\nbarn loft--boxes of ammunition, two saddles, piles of stolen rifles and\r\nan empty bunk. No room for anyone to hide.\r\n\r\nSergeant Lavender vigorously renewed his wiping.\r\n\r\n... johnsingletonmosby....\r\n\r\n"By God!" He snatched up a loaded pistol and rose. That voice had been\r\nas close as his skin. "Show yourself," he bawled.\r\n\r\nAt the far end of the loft a door creaked open and a short slender\r\nman, pistol in each hand, came out blinking sleepily. "What in blazes\r\nis the matter with you, Jake?"\r\n\r\n"Somebody called you, Captain. I could\'a sworn it! Somebody right\r\nhere." He indicated the room with a nervous wave of his pistol. "Used\r\nall three of your names too. Like whisperin\', it was. Captain, sir--you\r\nall right? Sir? 

=== Chunk 11 ===
_There!_--you hear \'em? A woman and a man, whisperin\'\r\nsomething about a daft sorta gun. Who is it, Captain? 

=== Chunk 12 ===
How are we\r\nhearin\' \'em?"\r\n\r\nWhen the hackles rose just so high on Jake Lavender\'s neck he fainted.\r\n\r\nHis captain followed suit a few moments later.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n... glanced at his watch, climbed respectfully to his feet. "Madam, my\r\npardons but my visitor\'s visa is up tomorrow noon. I\'ll have to ride\r\ntill night to catch the Shenandoah stage or I\'ll never make my morning\r\nsteamboat connections to New York."\r\n\r\nThe artillery major, Peter Hall, bowed gravely to his hostess. "It\'s\r\nextremely kind of such an important personage as yourself, Miss Mosby,\r\nto spend a while with a poor foreigner."\r\n\r\nHe straightened, studied his friend. "Well, Ed, are you in on this\r\nproject? Our Government needs your help if we are ever to perfect an\r\nelectric cannon. And you are, remember, still a Union citizen."\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t forgotten, Pete." He regarded Julie Mae\'s placid face. "It\'s\r\nsort of up to you, Miss Julie. I don\'t like the idea of bigger and\r\nbetter weapons--you both know me that well, but I guess I hate what the\r\nFrench are doing in Mexico even worse."\r\n\r\n"Our Governments now stand together, Major. 

=== Chunk 13 ===
Ed has my leave to do the\r\nresearch."\r\n\r\n"Fine." The officer stepped aside to let Julie Mae pass first through\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n"Have y\'all time for refreshments before leaving, sir? There\'s a very\r\nproper tavern on the campus."\r\n\r\nHall frowned at his watch. "I\'ll make the time, Ma\'am."\r\n\r\nJulie Mae Mosby, heir to her family\'s huge grants and honorary\r\npresident of the culturally important Mosby University, patted a long\r\ncurl into perfection with her folded fan. "I\'ve learned one thing from\r\ny\'all. Not all Northernahs are the uncouth messes your Erskine Caldwell\r\nsays y\'all are."\r\n\r\nThe officer managed a bleak smile. "You refer to his \'Marijuana Road\'?"\r\n\r\nJulie Mae nodded, allowed herself to be helped down a short flight of\r\nlustrous tiled steps. "That\'s the very book. I should think y\'all\'d be\r\nmighty unhappy with that scamp."\r\n\r\n"He\'s not too well received in polite Union circles, I assure you,\r\nMa\'am."\r\n\r\nProfessor Wilkes decided his friend had taken enough. "Miss Julie\'s\r\njust teasin\' you, Pete. She\'s traveled quite extensively in Union."\r\n\r\n"That\'s where I met Ed here, major. Three or four years ago--nineteen\r\nforty-eight, I believe. He was slavin\' his little ole brains away at\r\ndinky little Northwestern U." The woman nodded graciously to a bowing\r\nnegro slave, trilled her charming laugh. "Why, Major, I do believe it\'s\r\nstorming up to rain. If I\'m going to walk with y\'all to the tavern\r\nsomeone\'s going to have to give me his coat. Professor?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly, Miss Julie. Here."\r\n\r\nThey paused at the end of the wide and gleaming hallway, staring out\r\nacross the splendid campus at the rolling black sky.\r\n\r\n"Rain," grumbled the Major. "And my horse is a bad mudder. I\'ve got to\r\nbe in Fredericksburg by nine to make connections."\r\n\r\nThe first big drops came sailing down. "Heck! Hope my cape is in the\r\nsaddlebag."\r\n\r\nThe three hurried past a magnificent group of marble statuary that\r\ndepicted Grant surrendering to Lee. Beside them stood General Mosby\r\nwith his once incredible home-made grease-gun.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen his leisurely feast was done the Irritant launched himself in the\r\ndirection of home and before he had coasted a single thousand years or\r\nso was fast asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
