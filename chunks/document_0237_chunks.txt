DORMAN\r\n\r\nIllustrated by SCHELLING\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was an old house not far from the coast, and had descended generation\r\nby generation to the women of the Putnam family. Progress literally went\r\nby it: a new four-lane highway had been built two hundred yards from the\r\nancient lilacs at the doorstep. Long before that, in the time of Cecily\r\nPutnam\'s husband, power lines had been run in, and now on cold nights\r\nthe telephone wires sounded like a concert of cellos, while inside with\r\na sound like the breaking of beetles, the grandmother Cecily moved\r\nthrough the walls in the grooves of tradition.\r\n\r\nSimone Putnam, her granddaughter; Nina Putnam, her great-granddaughter;\r\nthe unbroken succession of matriarchs continued, but times the old woman\r\nthought that in Simone it was weakened, and she looked at the\r\nfour-year-old Nina askance, waiting, waiting, for some good sign.\r\n\r\nSometimes one of the Putnam women had given birth to a son, who grew\r\nsickly and died, or less often, grew healthy and fled. The husbands were\r\nusually strangers to the land, the house, and the women, and spent a\r\nlifetime with the long-lived Putnam wives, and died, leaving their\r\nstrange signs: telephone wires, electric lights, water pumps, brass\r\nplumbing.\r\n\r\nSam Harris came and married Simone, bringing with him an invasion of\r\nwasher, dryer, toaster, mixer, coffeemaster, until the current poured\r\nthrough the walls of the house with more vigor than the blood in the old\r\nwoman\'s veins.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t approve of him," Simone said to her grandmother.\r\n\r\n"It\'s his trade," Cecily Putnam answered. "Our men have been carpenters,\r\nor farmers, or even schoolmasters. But an engineer. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
Phui!"\r\n\r\nSimone was washing the dishes, gazing out across the windowsill where\r\ntwo pink and white Murex shells stood, to the tidy garden beyond where\r\nNina was engaged in her private games.\r\n\r\nShe dried the dishes by passing her hand once above each plate or glass,\r\nbringing it to a dry sparkle. It saved wear on the dishtowels, and it\r\namused her.\r\n\r\n"Sam\'s not home very much," she said in a placating voice. She herself\r\nhad grown terrified, since her marriage, that she wouldn\'t be able to\r\nbear the weight of her past. She felt its power on her and couldn\'t\r\ncarry it. Cecily had brought her up, after her father had disappeared\r\nand her mother had died in an unexplained accident. Daily she saw the\r\nreflection of her failure in the face of her grandmother, who seemed\r\nbuilt of the same seasoned and secure wood as the old Putnam house.\r\nSimone looked at her grandmother, whom she loved, and became a mere\r\nvapor.\r\n\r\n"He\'s not home so much," Simone said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHer face was small, with a pointed chin, and she had golden-red hair\r\nwhich she wore loose on her shoulders. Nina, too, had a small face, but\r\nit was neither so pale nor so delicate as her mother\'s, as if Sam\'s\r\ntougher substance had filled her out and strengthened her bone\r\nstructure. If it was true that she, Simone, was a weak link, then Sam\'s\r\nstrength might have poured into the child, and there would be no more\r\nPutnam family and tradition.\r\n\r\n"People don\'t change that easily," the old woman said.\r\n\r\n"But things--" Simone began. The china which had a history of five\r\ngenerations slipped out of her hands and smashed; Sam\'s toaster wouldn\'t\r\ntoast or pop up; Simone couldn\'t even use the telephone for fear of\r\ngetting a wrong number, or no number at all.\r\n\r\n"Things, things!" her grandmother cried. "It\'s blood that counts. If the\r\nblood is strong enough, things dissolve. They\'re just garbage, all those\r\nthings, floating on the surface of our history. It\'s our history that\'s\r\ndeep. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
That\'s what counts."\r\n\r\n"You\'re afraid of Sam," the young woman accused.\r\n\r\n"Not afraid of any man!" Cecily said, straightening her back. "But I\'m\r\nafraid for the child. Sam has no family tradition, no depth, no talent\r\nhanded down and perfected. A man with his head full of wheels and\r\nwires."\r\n\r\nSimone loved him. She leaned on him and grew about him, and he supported\r\nher tenderly. She wasn\'t going to give him up for the sake of some\r\nabstract tradition--\r\n\r\n"--it\'s not abstract," her grandmother said with spirit. "It\'s in your\r\nblood. Or why don\'t you sweep the floors the way other women do? The way\r\nSam\'s mother must?"\r\n\r\nSimone had begun to clean the house while she was thinking, moving her\r\nhand horizontally across the floor, at the height of her hip, and the\r\ndust was following the motion of her hand and moving in a small,\r\nsun-brightened river toward the trash basket in the kitchen corner. Now\r\nSimone raised her hand to her face to look at it, and the river of dust\r\nrose like a serpent and hung a foot below her hand.\r\n\r\n"Yes," she agreed, "at least I can clean the house. If I don\'t touch the\r\ngood china, and look where I\'m going."\r\n\r\n"Phui," the old woman said again, angrily. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
"Don\'t feel so sorry for\r\nyourself."\r\n\r\n"Not for myself," Simone mumbled, and looked again toward the garden\r\nwhere her daughter was doing something with three stones and a pie plate\r\nfull of spring water.\r\n\r\n"I do despair of Nina," Cecily said, as she had said before. "She\'s\r\nfour, and has no appearance. Not even balance. She fell out of the\r\napplerose tree, and couldn\'t even help herself." Suddenly the old woman\r\nthrust her face close to her granddaughter. It was smooth, round, and\r\nsweet as a young kernel of corn. The eyes, sunk down under the bushy\r\ngrey brows, were cold and clear grey.\r\n\r\n"Simone," the old woman said. "You didn\'t lie to me? You did know she\r\nwas falling, and couldn\'t get back in time to catch her?"\r\n\r\nA shudder passed through Simone\'s body. There was no blood in her veins,\r\nonly water; no marrow in her bones, they were empty, and porous as a\r\nbird\'s. Even the roots of her hair were weak, and now the sweat was\r\nstarting out on her scalp as she faced her grandmother and saw the\r\nbristling shapes of seven generations of Putnam women behind her.\r\n\r\n"You lied," the old woman said. "You didn\'t know she was falling."\r\n\r\nSimone was a vapor, a mere froth blowing away on the first breeze.\r\n\r\n"My poor dear," the old woman said in a gentle voice. "But how could you\r\nmarry someone like Sam? Don\'t you know what will happen? He\'ll dissolve\r\nus, our history, our talents, our pride. Nina is nothing but an ordinary\r\nlittle child."\r\n\r\n"She\'s a good child," Simone said, trying not to be angry. She wanted\r\nher child to be loved, to be strong. "Nina isn\'t a common child," she\r\nsaid, with her head bent. "She\'s very bright."\r\n\r\n"A man with his head full of wheels, who\'s at home with electricity and\r\nwires," the old woman went on. "We\'ve had them before, but never allowed\r\nthem to dominate us. My own husband was such a man, but he was only\r\nallowed to make token gestures, such as having the power lines put in.\r\nHe never understood how they worked." She lowered her voice to a\r\nwhisper, "Your Sam understands. I\'ve heard him talk to the water pump."\r\n\r\n"That\'s why you\'re afraid of him," Simone said. "Not because I\'m weak,\r\nand he might take something away from me, but because he\'s strong, and\r\nhe might give us something. Then everything would change, and you\'re\r\nafraid of that. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Nina might be our change." She pointed toward the\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFollowing the white line of her granddaughter\'s finger, Cecily looked\r\nout into the garden and saw Nina turn toward them as though she knew\r\nthey were angry. The child pointed with one finger directly at them in\r\nthe house. There was a sharp crackle, and something of a brilliant and\r\nvibrating blue leaped between the out-stretched fingers of mother and\r\ndaughter, and flew up like a bird to the power lines above.\r\n\r\n"Mommy," Nina called.\r\n\r\nSimone\'s heart nearly broke with wonder and fright. Her grandmother\r\ncontemptuously passed through the kitchen door and emerged on the step\r\noutside, but Simone opened the door and left it open behind her. "What\r\nwas that?" 

=== Chunk 6 ===
she asked Nina. "Was it a bluebird?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be silly," Nina said. She picked up the pie plate and brought it\r\ntoward them. Cecily\'s face was white and translucent, one hand went to\r\nher throat as the child approached.\r\n\r\nBrimfull of crackling blue fire with a fluctuating heart of yellow, the\r\npie plate came toward them, held between Nina\'s small, dusty hands. Nina\r\ngrinned at them. "I stole it out of the wires," she said.\r\n\r\nSimone thought she would faint with a mixture of joy and fear. "Put it\r\nback," she whispered. "Please put it back."\r\n\r\n"Oh Mommy," Nina said, beginning to whine. "Not now. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Not right away. I\r\njust got it. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
I\'ve done it lots of times." The pie plate crackled and\r\nhissed in the steady, small hands.\r\n\r\nSimone could feel the old woman\'s shocked silence behind her. "You\r\nmustn\'t carry it in a pie plate, it\'s dangerous," Simone said to her\r\nchild, but she could see Nina was in no danger. "How often have you done\r\nthis?" She could feel her skirt and her hair billow with electricity.\r\n\r\n"Lots of times. You don\'t like it, do you?" She became teasing and\r\nroguish, when she looked most like Sam. Suddenly she threw back her head\r\nand opened her mouth, and tilting up the pie plate she drank it empty.\r\nHer reddish gold hair sprang out in crackling rays around her face, her\r\neyes flashed and sparks flew out between her teeth before she closed her\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n"Nina!" the old woman cried, and began to crumple, falling slowly\r\nagainst Simone in a complete faint. Simone caught her in trembling hands\r\nand lowered her gently. She said to her daughter, "You mustn\'t do that\r\nin front of Grandy. You\'re a bad girl, you knew it would scare her," and\r\nto herself she said: I must stop babbling, the child knows I\'m being\r\nsilly. O isn\'t it wonderful, isn\'t it awful, O Sam, how I love you.\r\n\r\n"Daddy said it would scare you," Nina admitted. "That\'s why I never\r\nshowed you before." Her hair was softly falling into place again, and\r\nshe was gazing curiously at her great-grandmother lying on the doorstep.\r\n\r\n"It did scare me," Simone said. "I\'m not used to it, darling. But don\'t\r\nkeep it secret any more."\r\n\r\n"Is Grandy asleep?"\r\n\r\nSimone said hastily, "Oh yes, she\'s taking a nap. She is old, you know,\r\nand likes to take naps."\r\n\r\n"That\'s not a nap," Nina said, leaning over and patting the old woman\'s\r\ncheek, "I think she\'s having a bad dream."\r\n\r\nSimone carried her grandmother into the house. If that old, tired heart\r\nhad jumped and floundered like her own, there must be some damage done\r\nto it. If anything happened to her grandmother, the world would end,\r\nSimone thought, and was furious with Nina, and at the same time, full of\r\njoy for her.\r\n\r\nCecily Putnam opened her eyes widely, and Simone said, "It does change,\r\nyou see. But it\'s in the family, after all."\r\n\r\nThe old woman sat upright quickly. "That wicked child!" she exclaimed.\r\n"To come and frighten us like that. She ought to be spanked." She got up\r\nwith great strength and rushed out to the garden.\r\n\r\n"Nina!" she called imperiously. The child picked up one of the small\r\nstones from the pie plate now full of spring water, and came to her\r\ngreat-grandmother.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll make something for you, Grandy," she said seriously. She put the\r\nstone in the palm of her hand, and breathed on it, and then held out her\r\nhand and offered the diamond.\r\n\r\n"It\'s lovely. Thank you," the old woman said with dignity, and put her\r\nhand on the child\'s head. "Let\'s go for a walk and I\'ll show you how to\r\ngrow rose-apples. That\'s more becoming to a young lady."\r\n\r\n"You slept on the step."\r\n\r\n"Ah! I\'m old and I like to take little naps," Cecily answered.\r\n\r\nSimone saw them disappear among the applerose trees side by side. She\r\nwas still trembling, but gradually, as she passed her hand back and\r\nforth, and the dust followed, moving in a sparkling river toward the\r\ntrash basket, Simone stopped trembling and began to smile with the\r\nnatural pride of a Putnam woman.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ January 1963.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.
