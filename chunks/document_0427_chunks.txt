Only\r\n4W382ZT won free--though he couldn\'t beat the awful rap._\r\n\r\n[Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\nPlanet Stories May 1952.\r\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was silence in the grim room broken only by the riffle of filing\r\ncards from the corner where a trusty, in gray uniform, sat working at\r\na small desk. Warden Hughes sat at his large desk, idly fingering a\r\nsmall scale-model of a space ship which he used for a paperweight.\r\nAcross the desk from him, in a stiff-backed, plastic-covered chair,\r\nsat Greg Purnell, special investigator for the Congress of Earth.\r\n\r\nBefore Purnell had time to speak a bell shrilled on the warden\'s desk.\r\nHughes tabled the paperweight and picked up the phone. Purnell could\r\nnot tell from any change of expression what the message might be. The\r\nwarden listened carefully, grunted an uninforming "Yes, and then?" 

=== Chunk 2 ===
into\r\nthe phone, listened some more, and finally hung up. Immediately he\r\nlifted it again and dialed a number.\r\n\r\n"Send Rol, Dorta, and two mertha to my office at once. Have the\r\nhelicopter ready to go in ten minutes.... What?... Then have two zerda\r\nsaddled and ready. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Hop to it."\r\n\r\nPurnell nodded but the warden had already turned his back and was\r\npunching out a code on the panel behind his desk. He had scarcely\r\nfinished when there was a sigh and a ting. He slid a panel aside and\r\ntook a flat spool out of the cavity behind it. He placed it carefully\r\nin a squat machine which stood beside his desk.\r\n\r\nThere was evidently nothing more to be done until the arrival of Rol,\r\nDorta, and the two mertha, for the warden settled back in his chair and\r\nturned toward Greg.\r\n\r\n"That spool is the mentape of 4W382ZT, the prisoner who escaped. You\'ll\r\nsee what it\'s used for in a minute or so.

=== Chunk 4 ===
"\r\n\r\nThere was a firm tap at the warden\'s door. Purnell mentally chalked up\r\na note to commend Hughes for efficiency when he sent in his report. The\r\nwarden touched a button on his desk and the door swung open violently,\r\npushed aside by two creatures which bounded into the room.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPurnell jumped up from his chair and bit his lower lip to keep from\r\nscreaming. Then two tall men followed through the door and the biting,\r\ntearing flashes faded out of his mind. He slumped back into his chair.\r\nHis forehead was covered with fine droplets of perspiration and his\r\nshirt fluttered to his heart\'s violent throbs. Yet Greg Purnell was\r\na hard man who had come face to face with death many times on many\r\nstrange planets.\r\n\r\nPurnell looked over towards the desk in the corner. The trusty had\r\ndropped a set of cards and was trying to pick them up. His hands\r\nshook so violently that in three trials he succeeded in getting only\r\ntwo cards back on the desk. His face was pale and the sound of his\r\nbreathing rasped through the room.\r\n\r\nThe warden looked over towards the man. "I\'m sorry, Jim, I forgot it\r\nwas your tour of duty. You can leave now.

=== Chunk 5 ===
"\r\n\r\nJim hastily went through the side door of the room. Purnell turned back\r\ntowards the warden\'s desk. Rol and Dorta, for Greg decided that these\r\nmust be their names, were not men, though almost human. Their faces had\r\ntwo eyes, a nose and a mouth, but no ears.\r\n\r\nPurnell had seen natives of many different planets and knew how\r\ndifficult it was to try to interpret the meaning of an alien\r\nexpression. But he was certain that Rol and Dorta had absolutely no\r\nexpressions on their faces. The two mertha walked on all fours and\r\nhad heads which were more carnivorous looking than the men. They did\r\nnot have any ears, either. Their appearance would not have disturbed\r\nPurnell, except for the memory of his sensations when they had bounded\r\ninto the room.\r\n\r\nThe men and the animals were clustered about the squat machine and each\r\none wore a headset from it. The machine was buzzing softly. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
The buzzing\r\nstopped and Rol and Dorta took off all of the headsets. Warden Hughes\r\nspoke aloud to them, Purnell supposed out of courtesy to him, although\r\nthe Zirthans are telepaths.\r\n\r\n"Now you know the thought-pattern of the escaped prisoner. The weather\r\nover the valley has turned bad, too bad for the helicopter. There are\r\ntwo zerda ready below. Cross the Malu by the lower bridge and cast\r\nalong down the river. He will probably have turned off through the\r\nforest. If he doesn\'t try to hide there, he will head over the ridge\r\ntowards Zadda City. He mustn\'t reach it."\r\n\r\nThe two Zirthans saluted and silently left the room, followed by the\r\nmertha. The warden shrugged his shoulders and spoke to Purnell. "It\'s\r\nup to them, now. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
I apologize for exposing you to the mertha without\r\nwarning. But I know that men in your job have healthy hearts. You got a\r\ntouch of what is in store for that poor devil who got away."\r\n\r\n"What are the mertha?" asked Purnell.\r\n\r\n"Animals from Zirth," answered the warden. "They have the same\r\ntelepathic sense that the men from Zirth have, but can detect\r\nthought-patterns many miles away, whereas a Zirthan must be near. Of\r\ncourse they are not very intelligent but they obey simple telepathed\r\norders from the Zirthans."\r\n\r\n"But what happened when they came into the room? 

=== Chunk 8 ===
It was a terrifying\r\nfeeling." Purnell shivered involuntarily as he spoke of it.\r\n\r\nThe warden smiled grimly. "Yes, I\'ve experienced it. You see, on Zirth\r\nthe animals have no sense of hearing but instead can sense things\r\ntelepathically. The mertha came into the room and sensed a stranger.\r\nThey were \'barking\' and \'growling\' at you, but mentally. As soon as\r\nDorta came in he called them off with a mental command."\r\n\r\nPurnell crossed his long legs and spoke. "But you told me that your\r\nZirthan guards made escape impossible. How did this fellow get away?"\r\n\r\nThe warden grunted. "Excuse me, I said planned escape was impossible,\r\nand it is. Let a prisoner start making plans to get away and the guards\r\nare on to it at once. But this man made no plans. He was out on a work\r\ndetail and saw a log floating down the river. In an instant he dived\r\ninto the water and rode the log over the rapids. The guards fired at\r\nhim but missed, and he made the rapids--they saw him still on the log\r\nbelow the white water. Impromptu action is still possible."\r\n\r\n"Pardon me," said Purnell, "I see how that would be. But where could he\r\ngo? Isn\'t this planet just a prison colony for Earth?"\r\n\r\n"There are a few settlements," answered the warden. "Mostly space rats\r\nand prisoners whose terms have been served but who do not want to go\r\nback to Earth. And the space pirates have bases on some of the moons\r\nand contacts with the villagers. If he gets to a settlement they will\r\nhide him until the space pirates take him in. But he can\'t escape the\r\nmertha."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPurnell looked out the narrow window of the warden\'s office. The\r\nstorm driving up the valley had reached them now and rain was beating\r\nfiercely against the plastic. He thought of the fugitive stumbling\r\nthrough the fury of the storm and of the two mertha coming closer and\r\ncloser until the poor fellow\'s mind started cringing from the howling\r\nof these mental bloodhounds. He turned back to the warden.\r\n\r\n"I noticed that you ran the mentape through the machine but didn\'t show\r\nthe men any pictures of the escaped man. Are they familiar with his\r\nlooks?"\r\n\r\n"No. They have never seen the man, nor any picture of him." The warden\r\npaused to let this statement sink in, then went on before Purnell had\r\na chance to speak. "There would be no use. The Zirthans cannot tell\r\nus apart by features. Not only do all of us humans look alike to them\r\nbecause we are alien, but they are not in the habit of using physical\r\nlooks for such purposes. They have always used mental scanning for\r\nthat. You notice the total lack of expression on their faces. Anger,\r\nhate, love, whatever emotion you think of, is expressed by a Zirthans\r\nthoughts, not by his facial expression. Telepathy has its advantages.\r\nZirthans live in a world of mental calm and honesty that is unknown to\r\nus."\r\n\r\nThe more Purnell thought about this the more he realized that it\r\nwould be true. To a telepath the mind is an infinitely better source\r\nof information than the face would be. And just think, no physical\r\ndisguise would be of the slightest use.\r\n\r\n"What if the man falls asleep? Can the mertha trace him then?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied the warden. "Thoughts go on in sleep, as when we dream.\r\nThe mertha can\'t detect a man as far away when he is asleep, but an\r\nescaped prisoner does not go to sleep until he puts as great a distance\r\nbetween him and his prison as he can."\r\n\r\nThe wind had grown stronger, so strong that the thick plastic over the\r\nwindow shivered slightly. Purnell thanked the galaxy that he wasn\'t out\r\nchasing an escaped prisoner. He never liked those jobs, regardless of\r\nthe weather. He remembered once when he had gone out with hounds after\r\na murderer. Closer and closer they had come, with the hounds baying and\r\nyelping. At the end they trapped the man in a cave and the dogs got in\r\nfirst. It was not a pretty sight and Purnell had found it too easy to\r\nthink of himself in the other man\'s shoes. It didn\'t seem right.\r\n\r\nHe turned to the warden. "What happens when the mertha corner the\r\nfellow. Do they attack?"\r\n\r\n"Not physically, but they leave terrible mental scars unless the men\r\nget there quickly and call them off. You saw how Jim acted when they\r\ncame into the room. They weren\'t paying any attention to him, but he\r\nescaped once and the mertha tracked him down. Now he goes to pieces\r\nwhenever he sees one of them."\r\n\r\nPurnell grunted and pushed himself out of the chair. "It will be quite\r\na while before they can catch him. I am going to the office you were\r\nhelpful enough to lend me and work on my report. We can finish our\r\nbusiness after you get this affair off your mind. Will you let me know\r\nhow the chase comes out?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mr. Purnell, I shall be glad to. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
I\'ll call you."\r\n\r\nThe warden turned to a stack of papers on his desk and Purnell strode\r\nthrough the door.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe water was cold. He clung to the log for as long as he dared but his\r\nfingers were getting numb and his thighs could no longer grip the log\r\ntightly. It swung close to the left bank and the man slid off it and\r\nwearily stroked himself over to the bank. It was steep, and slippery\r\nfrom the rain, but he managed to crawl up. He lay on the wet grass\r\nfeeling the rain soak through his prison uniform. If he could just\r\nclose his eyes, but he had to go on. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
They would be after him in no time\r\nat all. The mertha. He shuddered at the thought of the stories he had\r\nheard.\r\n\r\nThe rain was thicker, slanting sharply from the strong wind. It was\r\nvile weather but it would keep the helicopters grounded. They wouldn\'t\r\ndare fly in the gusts that were sweeping up the valley. The mertha were\r\nfast but not as fast as a helicopter. If he could get over the ridge\r\nand into Zadda City there was always a space scout ready to take an\r\nescaped prisoner to the pirates\' moon.\r\n\r\nHe had been walking and running for an eternity. He slipped and\r\nstumbled up the long slope to the ridge, gasping for breath and digging\r\nhis fist into his side to dull the sharp pain that cut him there from\r\nthe running. He found himself straining to listen through the pounding\r\nof the rain. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
Then he cursed to himself. There wouldn\'t be anything\r\nto hear, no baying of these hell hounds, the mertha. Nothing for the\r\near--just torture and anguish for the mind.\r\n\r\nHe was near the top now. The last pitch was very steep and covered with\r\nhuge rocks. But what was that faint flicker in his mind? It ebbed and\r\nthen was back, a little stronger. A roiling, a hand dipping through his\r\nskull and stirring his brains. He clenched his fist harder and hauled\r\nhimself over another boulder.\r\n\r\nThe mertha were getting closer. The flashes were stabbing harder into\r\nhis brain now. But how close was that? He had no way of telling. Were\r\nthey behind him? Or in front? The torment in his mind had no direction.\r\nHe sobbed as he climbed.\r\n\r\nHe was on top of the ridge and Zadda City lay in the next valley. Maybe\r\nhe would make it. But it was getting harder and harder to think, his\r\nmind was racked with even greater force. They were getting closer and\r\ncloser. Hurry, run, run. But were they behind him? Oh, galaxy, had they\r\ncircled and come up the ridge in front of him? They were closing in\r\nahead of him, he felt it in every searing stroke which flashed through\r\nhis brain.\r\n\r\nHe turned sharp right and ran stumblingly along the ridge. Was it a\r\ntrifle easier? Yes, the flashes were fainter. He ran faster and faster.\r\nThe torment eased still more and a pale spectre of hope crept into his\r\nmind. And then fled. Ahead of him was the end of the ridge, a cliff,\r\nvertical and smooth. Before he could scarcely wonder if he had time to\r\nturn back, he knew he hadn\'t. His mind again flinched as a mental blast\r\nhit it.\r\n\r\nThere was a small cabin standing alone at the very edge of the cliff.\r\nThe windows were tightly boarded and it was evidently derelict. The\r\ndoor hung partly open and through it the fugitive scrambled. He slammed\r\nthe door shut and by force of desperation managed to shoot the rusty\r\nbolt into the hasp.\r\n\r\nInside he stood, wincing occasionally from a thrust into his mind, and\r\nstaring dumbly and despairingly around the barren room. But it wasn\'t\r\nquite barren. A gleam of hope calmed his mental torture when he saw an\r\nold shirt and pair of work pants hanging from a hook in a far corner\r\nof the room. He dashed across the floor, tearing his prison garb off\r\nas he went. The dust from the old clothes almost choked him as he flung\r\nthem on. He cast his hated prison garb into a dark corner and stamped\r\non it. Then he rushed to the door.\r\n\r\nHe had his hand on the bolt, ready to shove it open, when realization\r\nfinally came to him. He sank to the floor, numbed. No physical disguise\r\ncould fool the mertha or the prison guards. They tracked minds, not\r\nbodies or uniforms. The dreaded mertha gnawed a man\'s very brain.\r\n\r\nThe flaring hope which repulsed the mertha from his mind for the brief\r\nperiod of action there in the cabin had gone out. Again anguish crept\r\ninto his brain and contorted it. He opened his mouth to shriek, but\r\ninstead tore the shirt from off his back and stuffed it into his mouth.\r\nGagged, the poor wretch fell to the floor writhing, deprived of the\r\nslight relief that screams would have brought to the mind tormented\r\ninto physical action, but too anguished to realize that screams could\r\nnot be heard by his earless pursuers.\r\n\r\nHis mind was filled constantly with torment, now. He hoped and prayed\r\nfor the arrival of the guards but they did not come. 

=== Chunk 12 ===
It beat against\r\nhis brain, pound, pound, pound. In his mind was only the frantic I\r\ncan\'t stand it, I can\'t stand it, I....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLater in the day Purnell was asked to go to Warden Hughes\' office.\r\nHe entered the room with great interest and saw the warden seated at\r\nhis desk with a glum expression on his face. One of the Zirthans was\r\nstanding in front of the desk, but the other one and the two mertha\r\nwere not in the room.\r\n\r\n"Come in, Mr. Purnell," said the warden. "The prisoner got away, the\r\nfirst one to escape since we brought the mertha here two years ago.\r\nI waited for you to come before hearing Rol\'s full report. Here, put\r\non this headset and you can \'hear\' his thoughts." The warden handed\r\nPurnell one of the sets from the squat machine. Purnell noticed that\r\nthe warden and Rol were each wearing one and he quickly adjusted his.\r\n\r\nThe Zirthan\'s thoughts sounded deep in his mind, almost like hearing,\r\nsince his brain translated the thoughts into English words, but yet\r\ndifferent enough for Purnell to realize that it wasn\'t ordinary speech.\r\n\r\n"Dorta and I, with the mertha, tracked the prisoner to the final slope\r\nof the ridge. Here we had to dismount and follow on foot. At this point\r\nwe came close enough to sense the man\'s thought-pattern, so we know we\r\nwere following the right man. Then he evidently reached the top and\r\nspeeded up, for we lost touch again. The mertha were far ahead of us\r\nwhen we finally reached the top of the ridge. When we came close to\r\nthem, they were running around and around a cabin, which we first took\r\nto be abandoned, perched at the edge of the cliff. We were still not\r\nclose enough to sense the fugitive when suddenly the mertha stopped\r\nrunning and started casting around. They had lost the thought-pattern.\r\n\r\n"We had a clear view of the only door of the cabin and we found later\r\nthat all the windows were nailed shut. We approached the cabin to\r\ninvestigate but before we reached the door it opened and a man came\r\nout. Dorta went on past the man into the cabin, which he searched\r\nquickly. But he found no one there. I stopped the man and scanned his\r\nmind lightly for pattern and knowledge of the fugitive. He was not the\r\nescaped convict nor had he seen or heard anyone.\r\n\r\n"He was a strange figure, standing there in a pair of dirty old pants\r\nand no shirt. He drew himself up to full height and stared at me for an\r\ninstant. Then he turned and strode off in the direction of Zadda City."\r\n\r\n"But didn\'t you find out who he was," came the warden\'s thoughts. "What\r\nwas his name?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I found out his name. He was Napoleon. Napoleon Bonaparte."\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
