In the present, piracy is as tawdry as tabloid headlines.\r\n    But piracy in the far future, when presented as vividly as in this\r\n    story, can be scary stuff._\r\n\r\n\r\n    this\r\n     one\r\n problem\r\n\r\n _by ... M. C. Pease_\r\n\r\n\r\n The shortest distance between two points may be\r\n the long way around--and a path of dishonor may\r\n well turn into the high road to virtue.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarc Polder, Resident Comptroller of Torran, strolled idly down the\r\ndusty littered path that passed for a street. In the half-light of the\r\npint-sized moon overhead the town looked almost romantic. One day, when\r\ncivilization had at last been brought to these Asteroid bases, memory\r\nwould make Torran heroic. But now, with the fact before the eyes, it was\r\nmerely dirty and squalid. Only the scum of the Solar System called it\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nIdly Marc Polder pushed a swinging door aside and entered what passed on\r\nTorran for a restaurant. Pushing his way through the tables until he saw\r\nhis only aide, Female Personnel Manager Lee Treynor, he sat down.\r\n\r\n"What\'s new?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Not a thing." But for a certain softness of voice and curve of\r\nunmade-up lips, Lee could have passed for a boy. Her light hair was\r\nshort, she wore a man\'s coveralls. She added, "Only the usual murder,\r\narson and brigandage that you don\'t want to hear about."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t let such trifles get you down," said Marc with a crooked\r\nhalf-smile.\r\n\r\n"I\'m fed up," the girl said shortly. "I must have been still wet behind\r\nthe ears when I agreed to come out here two months ago. I thought I was\r\ngoing to help establish a place where decent people could live and work.\r\nSo far I\'ve just watched my boss swig Venerian swamp beer with the worst\r\nelements in town, and do nothing about the lawlessness that runs riot\r\nall over the place."\r\n\r\n"Look, lady," Marc answered gently, "I certainly admire those lofty\r\nsentiments of yours. I admit they are maybe what ought to be. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
But the\r\nway I see it they just don\'t fit the facts. Out here the Federation\r\nspace fleet is supposed to be the big stick. Only right now it\'s off\r\nplaying mumbly-peg with the Venerians.\r\n\r\n"The Big Wheels seem to think there\'ll be a shooting war in a couple of\r\nmonths. There\'s only three or four destroyers left in the whole damn\r\nAsteroid Belt. And without the big stick behind me I\'m not hankering to\r\ncommit suicide by looking for trouble."\r\n\r\nMarc smiled again ruefully. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
"What I can do I try to do," he added with\r\nsudden earnestness. "I figure the most important thing is to protect the\r\nAsteroid Development Company so they can buy the nuclear ore the\r\nAstrodites bring in. Without that ore the Federation\'s going to be in a\r\nhell of a fix if it actually does come to war. And along with that\r\nthere\'s the matter of guarding the stuff the Navy\'s got stored here." He\r\nwaved toward the Navy warehouse that could be seen outside the window.\r\n\r\n"Listening to and fraternizing with the characters you call the biggest\r\ncrooks in town," the comptroller went on with a shrug, "I\'ve a chance at\r\ngetting tipped off in advance to anything that may make trouble for our\r\ninterests. As long as I ignore their rackets they accept me in their\r\nmidst, talk freely with me around. And it\'s a hell of a lot easier to\r\nstop something when you know the score beforehand."\r\n\r\nThe young woman\'s lips parted as if she seemed about to say something.\r\nThen they closed in a thin line. Obviously she was not happy with Marc\r\nPolder\'s explanation. She was too young to be willing to compromise her\r\nideals, no matter how potent the logic of necessity.\r\n\r\nShe was about to leave the table when the shrill screams of a distant\r\nwhistle sliced through the noise of the crowd. Voices broke off in\r\nmid-sentence and bodies froze into immobility. As the siren\'s piercing\r\ntones faded the restaurant\'s customers looked at one another in silent\r\nterror. Then, as the shock wore off and unanswered questions were\r\nbeginning to fly, a man suddenly ran in through the revolving doors.\r\n\r\n"Raiders!" he gasped. "The listening gear\'s picked up a signal that\'s\r\nnot from any Astrodite or destroyer. Signal Corps figures it\'s a\r\npirate!"\r\n\r\nThere was a mad rush for the doors and seconds later the place was empty\r\nexcept for Marc Polder, still sitting calmly at the table drinking his\r\nbeer, and Lee Treynor who sat watching him.\r\n\r\n"What are you going to do?" she finally asked.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. What _can_ I do?" Marc said.\r\n\r\n"Good heavens!" the girl exploded. "Are you just going to sit there\r\nguzzling beer while pirates take over the town?" She stared at him\r\nincredulously.\r\n\r\n"What do you suggest I do?" the comptroller asked. "We haven\'t anything\r\nto fight with. There\'s no way we can get help. As far as I can see\r\nthere\'s nothing we _can_ do--not yet anyway." He calmly lifted his\r\nglass.\r\n\r\n"You mean we\'re just going to _sit_ here?" the girl gaped.\r\n\r\n"Sure. The others left to hide their money and valuables. I\'ve got\r\nnothing to hide."\r\n\r\n"What about that stuff the Navy has cached in their warehouse?" Lee\r\nasked. "That new rocket fuel their destroyers use when they need a\r\nlittle extra push. Isn\'t that worth hiding?"\r\n\r\n"The hyper-degenerate-thorium, you mean? I\'d like to hide that\r\nsomewhere," Marc conceded. "But where do you hide ten tons of stuff in\r\nfive minutes? Besides, it wouldn\'t do the raiders any good. Too hot.\r\nIt\'ll burn out their jets. They\'d go up like an A-bomb two minutes after\r\nthey threw it on. They know that. Only thing they could do with it is\r\nsell it to Venus. Not that that would be bad. Shortage of H.D.T.\'s may\r\nbe the chief reason why there\'s been no war started yet. But for now\r\nthere\'s nothing you and I can do." Calmly he lit a cigarette.\r\n\r\n"Of course," he went on, smiling, "we _could_ bum a ride out with some\r\nof the company men. No doubt they\'re all hightailing it away from here\r\nin their space-buggies."\r\n\r\n"I\'m surprised," Lee said with a trace of sarcasm, "that you\'re not\r\ndoing just that, leaving me and the other women to the beasts!"\r\n\r\nMarc eyed her unblinkingly. "You know as well as I do that most of the\r\nfemales on this asteroid take pirates in their stride. They might even\r\nwelcome a change of partners. As for you"--he paused--"you stick close\r\nto me and keep your pretty mouth shut. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
I think we\'ll manage somehow."\r\n\r\nIn silence they walked back to the comptroller\'s office.\r\n\r\n"Marc," Lee said as they entered, "what about the new radar? Maybe we\r\ncould get a message out with it, in code or something."\r\n\r\n"What?" 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Marc turned, astonished. "You want to play our only hole-card on\r\nan off-chance like that? There aren\'t more than four or five people\r\nhere who even know it\'s been set up on the other side of the asteroid.\r\nThere\'s hardly a chance the raiders will find out about it. And you want\r\nto blast the news at them!" He looked disgusted.\r\n\r\nThe girl said stubbornly, "You can\'t just give up without a fight. And\r\nthat\'s our only weapon."\r\n\r\n"Look," Marc said grimly, "that\'s only a second-hand destroyer radar, so\r\nit wouldn\'t carry far. No. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
I\'m not going to use it on any such\r\nharebrained scheme as that. And if you breathe a word about it I\'ll take\r\nyou apart." 

=== Chunk 7 ===
He added with a faint smile, "Not that _that_ wouldn\'t be a\r\npleasure."\r\n\r\nLooking at him she knew he meant the tender joke and the knowledge\r\nhelped her.\r\n\r\n"I think," Marc went on after a moment, "I\'d better warn the boys over\r\non the radar project or they might accidentally start it up while the\r\nraiders are here." He closed the door as he went into the inner office\r\nto make the call.\r\n\r\nA moment later he emerged and studied the still angry girl through\r\nhalf-closed eyes. She blushed under his scrutiny, said coldly, "What\'s\r\nthe matter? Afraid I\'m not attractive enough for our visitors?"\r\n\r\nHe grinned. "You could do with a mite of padding here and there. But I\r\nwas thinking the other way, as a matter of fact. It\'s a pity you don\'t\r\nhave a small mustache."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t have to insult me!" Lee cried bitterly. "I\'m _glad_ I\'m\r\nthin!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not insulting you," Marc said mildly. "I even wish you were a bit\r\nskinnier. It\'s the plump girls our guests are going to be looking at\r\nfirst. Remember now--you stick right with me and keep your mouth shut,\r\nd\'you hear?

=== Chunk 8 ===
"\r\n\r\n"I hear," she said shortly. But he could see the fear she was trying to\r\nhide and he knew she was honestly frightened for the first time in her\r\nadult life. She said, "What will they--be like?"\r\n\r\n"If it\'s John Mantor, and I suspect it is, they\'ll be rough," Marc\r\ninformed her. "He\'s a tough ex-pilot who got bounced off Space Patrol\r\nand turned outlaw. He seems to hold a grudge against the whole human\r\nrace. If it\'s one of the others--it may be a lot worse."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see why outlaws are allowed to exist at all," she said.\r\n\r\nMarc sighed, shook his head. "A lot of people have felt that way over a\r\nlot of pirates over a lot of eras. But somehow they keep turning up."\r\n\r\nA few minutes later the space-scarred pirate ship had made a rocky\r\nlanding in the middle of the small spaceport and John Mantor, pirate\r\nchief, drove up to the comptroller\'s office in a cloud of dust. He was\r\ntall and dirty and thin and tough. "Which one of you is the\r\ncomptroller?" he demanded, as he faced Marc Polder and Lee Treynor.\r\n\r\n"I am," Marc said, not rising from behind the desk.\r\n\r\n"Then you\'re the guy responsible for any trouble here," Mantor said. "So\r\nI\'m going to tell you how to avoid trouble." His brutally scarred face\r\ntwisted into a grin.\r\n\r\n"There\'s a lot of loot around here. I\'m not going to ask you where it\r\nis. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
My boys can take care of that matter. But there\'s also the Navy\r\nwarehouse. Maybe we won\'t know what some of the stuff in there is for,\r\nso you\'re going to tell us."\r\n\r\nMantor leaned across the desk, his eyes as hard and cold as chips of\r\nduratite. "And if you won\'t, there\'s going to be trouble and you\'ll be\r\nit--you and your friend here."\r\n\r\nMarc sat impassively, meeting the hard-eyed gaze. "That warehouse is\r\ngovernment property," he said. "So far, there\'s only piracy against you.\r\nBut if you raid that building you\'re going to be the personal problem of\r\nthe Navy. If I were you I\'d leave it alone."\r\n\r\n"You let me worry about that," said Mantor.\r\n\r\n"Besides," Marc went on, "I don\'t see what good the stuff in that\r\nwarehouse can be to you. There\'s little of cash value in there. And I\r\ndoubt if you can use any of the parts on your ship."\r\n\r\n"That could be," Mantor replied. "But on the other hand, maybe we can\r\nfind a market for certain items." He smiled coldly. Watching, Lee knew\r\nhe referred to Venus. She sat perfectly still, praying for him not to\r\nnotice her.\r\n\r\nMantor spread his hands on the desk, a look of hatred and ferocity on\r\nhis face. "What I want to know is--are you or are you not going to\r\ncooperate? And I want to know fast."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t get me wrong," Marc said softly. "I\'m not telling you what to do\r\nor what not to do. But that warehouse is the thing I\'m here to protect.\r\nAnd if I were to agree to help you, the Navy would be after me, too. So\r\nI\'ve got to say to hell with you."\r\n\r\nJohn Mantor rocked back on his heels, hooking his thumbs in his belt. A\r\nslow smile spread over his face. "Okay," he said. "I think I get what\r\nyou mean. So I guess we got to work you over. And we\'ll do it where\r\nthere aren\'t any outside witnesses."\r\n\r\nMarc grinned back at him.\r\n\r\nLee was puzzled. It took her a moment to realize that the grins sealed a\r\ncontract between the two men. Marc would cooperate if he were beaten up\r\nenough first to satisfy a later investigation--but not too severely for\r\nhis own comfort!\r\n\r\nLee found it difficult to hide her contempt. She stared at her hands,\r\nclenched in her lap, and waited for Mantor to leave.\r\n\r\nThe looting and destruction were well under way an hour later when a\r\ncouple of Mantor\'s men joined their chief, who stood with a somewhat\r\nbruised Marc Polder and an unharmed but furious Lee Treynor. Between\r\nthem they carried a small, obviously heavy box.\r\n\r\n"You know what this stuff is, boss?" one of the men asked. "They got a\r\nhundred or a hundred-fifty boxes like this in there." He nodded at the\r\nNavy warehouse.\r\n\r\nThey set the box down and Mantor flung back its lid. It was filled with\r\nsmall grey pellets. Mantor picked up a handful and stood fingering them.\r\n\r\n"Looks like rocket fuel," he said. "Only I\'ve never seen any this color.\r\nAnd it\'s too heavy, also." He turned to the comptroller. "_You_ tell me\r\nwhat it is."\r\n\r\nMarc shrugged. "I don\'t know. It\'s a Navy secret."\r\n\r\nMantor\'s eyes glinted. Without warning his fist flew out, sent the\r\ncomptroller sprawling in the dust where he lay stunned. Lee\'s hands flew\r\nto her mouth barely in time to suppress a cry.\r\n\r\nAfter a few moments Marc rolled over slowly and pushed himself painfully\r\nto a sitting position. He looked up at Mantor who stood watching him\r\ncoldly, his fist flexing.\r\n\r\nThe comptroller licked his lips and looked around at the several men who\r\nstood watching, their faces impassive. "Okay," he said in a\r\nnone-too-steady voice. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
"I\'ll tell you. You\'d find out anyway from the\r\nfiles."\r\n\r\n"Cut the alibis and give," Mantor growled.\r\n\r\n"Keep your shirt on." Marc\'s voice indicated he was regaining control of\r\nhimself. "It\'s H.D.T.--Hyper-Degenerate-Thorium--the stuff the\r\ndestroyers use to get extra push."\r\n\r\nMantor roared his glee. "Pack it aboard, boys--_all_ of it! And put it\r\nwhere it will be handy, just in case."\r\n\r\nThis was it, Lee thought as she stood by, watching--the final bitter\r\npill. Mantor had as much as told them he was working for Venus. And the\r\nH.D.T. was all Venus needed to be ready for war--a war that might well\r\nblast civilization from the Solar System. Strange that so much should\r\ndepend upon one man; tragic that the one man was a weakling.\r\n\r\nWith an effort Lee forced herself to be fair. It might have done no good\r\nto lie, she conceded. But anyone with even a normal amount of simple\r\ncourage would have tried.\r\n\r\nIt was about two hours later when the siren went off again like a\r\nbanshee wailing to a low-hanging moon. Men came running from all\r\ndirections, shouting questions at the tops of their voices.\r\n\r\nA midget auto came skidding down the pirate ship\'s ramp, its driver\r\nstanding on the accelerator. The car knifed through the swirling crowd,\r\nbarely missing several people, and skidded to a dusty stop directly in\r\nfront of Mantor.\r\n\r\n"_Radar signal!_" the driver yelled. "The search receiver picked up a\r\nsignal that sounds like a destroyer\'s radar. It suddenly came in strong.\r\nProbably sneaked up on us from behind that damn moon. It\'s coming in\r\nfast and braking hard!"\r\n\r\nThere was a mad scramble as the looters raced for their ship.\r\nHeavy-handed horseplay was forgotten. They knew they were helpless\r\nagainst a Navy destroyer. Their only hope lay in a fast getaway. Seconds\r\ncould easily spell the difference between safety and defeat.\r\n\r\nIn less than ten minutes the ship\'s locks were sealed and they fired\r\noff. As the flames roared out and the huge ship lifted swiftly it was\r\nobvious that they were throwing on all the fuel their jets could take.\r\n\r\nMarc Polder had faded back into the crowd at the first sound of the\r\nsiren. As he stood watching the blastoff Lee joined him, hands in her\r\npockets, looking more than ever like a boy.\r\n\r\n"Maybe my idea of asking for help wasn\'t so far-fetched," she said\r\nquietly. "Maybe the patrol might have been here in time. Maybe you\r\nwouldn\'t have had to tell them about the H.D.T."\r\n\r\n"Maybe," Marc answered without turning his eyes from the dwindling point\r\nof reddish light high in the dark sky.\r\n\r\n"And just by way of keeping the record straight," the girl went on in a\r\nvoice that began to rasp, "you know as well as I do that the files don\'t\r\nlist any H.D.T. It\'s under a code name."\r\n\r\n"Maybe," Marc replied in a noncommittal tone.\r\n\r\nThe point of light in the sky suddenly turned blue. Lee was staring at\r\nit too, now. And she knew also what the change of color meant. Mantor\r\nhad started to use the new fuel!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was a blinding flash. Lee cried out and staggered back,\r\ncovering her eyes. Marc, who had closed his eyes when the color change\r\ncame, took hold of the girl\'s arm.\r\n\r\n"I told you what would happen if they used the stuff," he said gently.\r\n"It\'s too hot for their jet chambers. It melts the walls. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
A lot of gas\r\npiles up in the tubes. The pressure pushes the fire back. And when it\r\ngets shoved back into the recoil chamber and you lose the protective\r\nlayers of cold gas there--well, then you\'ve got to look for your ship\r\nwith an ionization gauge!\r\n\r\n"I told you all that long ago. The trouble is, you\'re too idealistic,\r\nLee. That\'s not the same as _having ideals_. I admire ideals--I might\r\neven confess to a few of my own. But _you_ don\'t stop to figure out just\r\nwhat your ideals are--exactly what you\'re fighting for.\r\n\r\n"You come to a crisis like this one and you forget about the _big_ goal.\r\nAll you see is this one problem. And by giving them yes-or-no\r\nanswers--good or bad, brave or cowardly--to the problem of the\r\nmoment--you may miss a simple solution to the big one.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got to keep a cool head and never forget for even a moment\r\nexactly what it is you want to accomplish." His voice was gentle, and it\r\nheld no rebuke.\r\n\r\n"All right," said Lee unhappily, "you win. You needn\'t bother to rub in\r\nthe salt. I was going to chase you through all the inquiry courts for\r\nthis. Instead, you got a lucky break, so I can\'t do a thing. You ought\r\nto be tarred and feathered through every city of the Federation, but\r\nbecause a destroyer happened to stumble in here at the right time you\'ll\r\nend up a hero." Her voice caught in a sob.\r\n\r\n"Oh, the destroyer," Marc replied. "Ah, yes, that _was_ lucky, wasn\'t\r\nit? The only hitch is--there wasn\'t any destroyer. Probably not one\r\nwithin a million miles!" He laughed as Lee turned surprise-widened eyes\r\ntoward him.\r\n\r\n"What they thought was a destroyer was the radar system on the side of\r\nthe rock, bouncing a signal off the moon. I gave the radar boys the word\r\njust before Mantor dropped in on us. The crew did a damned good job of\r\njuggling the power and frequency and all." He grinned. 

=== Chunk 12 ===
"Remind me to buy\r\nthem a beer sometime."\r\n\r\nHe laughed then at the girl\'s expression as it changed from bitter\r\ndisillusion to something akin to awe, close to hero-worship.\r\n\r\n"And this, by the way," Polder said, "is as good a time as any to tell\r\nyou that I\'d like to see you look like a woman, for a change. How about\r\nchanging into a dress before we go into town. You know, I\'ve never seen\r\nyou out of that uniform?"\r\n\r\nShe hesitated, unsure of herself now. "That will take a little time,"\r\nshe said doubtfully.\r\n\r\nHe put hands on her slim shoulders, gave her a gentle shove toward her\r\nquarters. "We\'ve got time," he told her. "Lots of it. 

=== Chunk 13 ===
But I\'ve been\r\nwaiting quite a while."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ March 1954.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.
