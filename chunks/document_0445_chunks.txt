"\'The\r\nsecret of immortality,\' it sounds as dated as the philosopher\'s stone."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean? We\'re not immortal."\r\n\r\n"No, we\'re not--though you may not have noticed that the last report of\r\nthe committee for India gives the life expectancy there now as seventy\r\nyears. And because of consistently good medical care, you and I both\r\nlook a good ten years younger than our actual chronological age."\r\n\r\nScott was in his early thirties: he had the trim body and resilient\r\nskin of first maturity.\r\n\r\n"That\'s not immortality."\r\n\r\n"No, of course not. That\'s what I\'m driving at. How do we arrest aging\r\nand prolong life? With some mysterious serum, by some dark business\r\nwith a fantastic ray? Hocus-pocus of a sort which would be the\r\nequivalent of the philosopher\'s stone I mentioned?\r\n\r\n"We\'ve increased our temporal range to the point where it\'s not\r\nat all unusual to meet active and alert people who\'ve passed the\r\ncentury mark. Society has done that by a system of care which is\r\npre-prenatal, by seeing to it that every human being grows up in the\r\nbest possible environment and receives the best possible nutrition,\r\nand by prophylactic measures of all possible sorts. In a word, we\'ve\r\neliminated from human life all the stresses and strains which can be\r\neliminated. And that\'s the nearest to immortality we\'ll ever get."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrost raised his eyebrows. "You heard what Thor-na\'thor said. How do\r\nyou account for it?"\r\n\r\nScott went over to the viewing plates and turned them to low power. The\r\nmass of buildings that was Tarthal leaped into visibility. "I don\'t\r\naccount for it," he said, with his back to Frost. "We don\'t speak his\r\nlanguage very well yet; we may have misunderstood. Or he may have been\r\nspeaking metaphorically."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense! You heard him say, \'And you let him die?\' when we were\r\ntelling him about Kynaston\'s burial. That wasn\'t metaphor. He sounded\r\ndeeply and genuinely shocked. In my opinion, Thor-na\'thor was shocked\r\nbecause, here on Vardia, among his own people, no one ever dies."\r\n\r\nScott shrugged and did not answer for a moment. "I might believe," he\r\nwent on after a pause, "that they\'d worked out therapeutic techniques\r\nwhich are more successful than ours in prolonging life, if the Vardians\r\nweren\'t obviously at a low level of scientific progress. Their vehicles\r\nare steam-powered, and they light their buildings with carbon-filament\r\nelectric lights. Their young men and women dabble in science, yes, but\r\nfor exactly the same reason that they take an interest in music and\r\npainting and the dramatic arts--because it\'s cultural."\r\n\r\n"Got you there!" 

=== Chunk 2 ===
Frost said in some triumph. He got up and began to\r\npace the cabin\'s length. "You\'re assuming that scientific advances\r\noccur evenly and are distributed, so to speak, on a plane. Didn\'t you\r\ntake any courses in the history of science?\r\n\r\n"One of the most striking features of terrestrial science has been\r\nits uneven development. Man knew the diameter of the earth before he\r\nwas aware of the circulation of the blood, and it was more than two\r\nhundred years after the laws of moving bodies were formulated before\r\nthe science of psychology was born. First the physical sciences, then\r\nbiology, and at last sociology and the psychology of the depths.\r\n\r\n"What reason is there to think that Thor-na\'thor\'s people haven\'t\r\nreversed the progression and developed the life sciences first?"\r\n\r\n"The order of development on earth wasn\'t accidental, but dictated by\r\nthe nature of things; physics is an easier science than psychology. And\r\nleaving that aside, why is Thor-na\'thor so reticent about it, assuming\r\nyou\'re right? You\'ve tried to pump him a dozen times since he made that\r\nremark about Kynaston, and all he does is look embarrassed and change\r\nthe subject. Supposing he\'s understood you, and you him, his attitude\r\nis more appropriate to a religious matter than a scientific one."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got a theory about that." Frost ruffled up his hair. "I suppose\r\nyou mean the way he\'s so careful to keep us away from that building in\r\nthe north of the city.\r\n\r\n"Would it be the first time a scientific discovery has been taken over\r\nby religion? Remember those steam engines and assorted gadgets the\r\nAlexandrians invented, and how they were used to produce miracles for\r\nthe devout? Or there may have been a gradual decadence with religion\r\nmoving slowly in on science. That might explain the general quietism in\r\nthe atmosphere, though I admit the Vardians don\'t seem decadent."\r\n\r\n"Um."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t believe me?" Frost said.\r\n\r\n"Not a bit of it. Nope."\r\n\r\n"Will you help me?"\r\n\r\n"... Yes."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThor-na\'thor was a good dinner guest. He held his liquor well, he\r\nlaughed in the places where laughter was appropriate, he even essayed a\r\nmild jest or two of his own. He was genuinely friendly and amiable.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Frost and Scott were not pleased. They were too tense\r\nand excited to enjoy their guest\'s social qualities, and his ability\r\nto soak up liquor without being affected by it was nothing less than\r\ncatastrophic. They were both a good deal drunker than Thor-na\'thor was,\r\nand it was not their tongues the evening had been designed to loosen.\r\n\r\nScott twitched an eyelid in signal to Frost. "Got a Venusian liquor,"\r\nthe latter said feebly to Thor-na\'thor. "Like your opinion on it." He\r\ngot a bottle from the buffet.\r\n\r\n"Certainly," Thor-na\'thor replied, smiling and holding out his glass.\r\n"Delighted, my boy. What generous hosts you terrestrials are!"\r\n\r\n"Thanks." With inebriated precision, Frost poured a huge snort of\r\nphyteumah into the Vardian\'s glass, and portions as much smaller as was\r\nconsistent with decency into Scott\'s and his own.\r\n\r\n"I especially appreciate your invitation," Thor-na\'thor went on,\r\nsipping at his drink, "since I have been distressed--absurdly, I\r\nsuppose, but there it is--over the death a few days ago of a pet of\r\nmine. This evening has been a welcome distraction for me." He sipped\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nFrost and Scott exchanged quick glances. Was this going to be easier\r\nthan they had thought?\r\n\r\n"That\'s too bad," Scott said. "What was it, a dog?"\r\n\r\n"An animal very similar to a dog. I had reared Lilil from shortly after\r\nher birth. One grows attached to them."\r\n\r\nStill sipping, Thor-na\'thor launched on an anecdote designed to\r\nillustrate Lilil\'s cleverness and quasi-human abilities. It grew into a\r\nbiography, and still he sipped phyteumah from his glass. When the glass\r\nwas empty, Frost poured more in it unobtrusively while Thor-na\'thor\r\ntalked on. The glass was refilled twice before the Vardian paused. "I\r\nregret her death," he finished.\r\n\r\nScott decided to plunge. "How fortunate you are spared such losses with\r\nyour own people!" he said, tripping over the consonants. "You Vardians\r\ndon\'t die, do you?"\r\n\r\n"No." The answer was immediate.\r\n\r\nFrost cast a glance of triumph at Scott. The latter scarcely perceived\r\nit; Thor-na\'thor\'s open admission had nonplussed him. He halted and\r\ntried to cudgel his foggy mind into deciding what to say next.\r\n\r\n"What is the cause of that?" he got out at last; he had had too much to\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\n"What boys you terrestrials are!" the Vardian answered, smilingly. He\r\ngot to his feet. "Thank you for a delightful evening. Good night." 

=== Chunk 3 ===
He\r\nhalted at the top of the companionway. "I believe we shall have rain\r\nbefore morning," he said, and was gone.\r\n\r\n"The blamed old buzzard!" Scott said. He took a sip of water and\r\nanother Sobrior pill. "Leading us on, guzzling our food, guzzling our\r\ndrink, and finally laughing at us! He told us that yarn about that dog\r\nof his just so we\'d bite and ask him if the Vardians were immortal! The\r\nblamed old ape!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but never mind that," Frost replied. He had taken two Sobrior\r\npills and was quite himself again. "The important thing is that he\r\nadmitted it."\r\n\r\n"He only said that to make us look like fools."\r\n\r\n"What does he care whether we\'re fools or not? There\'s really something\r\nthere, or he wouldn\'t be so coy about it!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll find out what he\'s up to if it\'s the last thing I do!"\r\n\r\n"Listen, let\'s try--"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThor-na\'thor said, "Yes, this machine would be most useful to my\r\npeople. We have dramatic entertainments, but nothing like that." He\r\nindicated the tiny stereo projector Scott was holding out to him. "We\r\nVardians are a happy folk, but I believe your machine would make us a\r\nlittle happier."\r\n\r\n"You could make a lot of money with it," Scott said.\r\n\r\nThor-na\'thor gave a slight shrug. "Money--that is not so important on\r\nVardia. But it is true that I should be the object of a great deal of\r\ngratitude from my people if I introduced it to them."\r\n\r\n"You\'d like that?" Scott asked. "You Vardians value that?"\r\n\r\n"We value it greatly. I should like it very much."\r\n\r\n"It\'s yours," Scott said, holding out the stereo projector.\r\n\r\nAn expression of extreme pleasure came over Thor-na\'thor\'s face. "Thank\r\nyou!" he said, extending his hand. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
"You are very generous."\r\n\r\n"If," Scott hurried on, "you\'ll tell us why the Vardians don\'t die."\r\n\r\nThor-na\'thor pulled his hand back. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
"I beg your pardon," he said\r\nquietly. "I had thought it was a gift."\r\n\r\nScott\'s cheeks began to burn. "Oh, heck," he said bruskly, "take the\r\nth--"\r\n\r\n"Shut up, Scott," Frost broke in. And then, to Thor-na\'thor, "We\'ll\r\ngive it to you, and gladly--and a lot of other stuff, too--if you\'ll do\r\nwhat Scott said. How can it hurt you to tell us? Why don\'t you want us\r\nto know?"\r\n\r\n"You are joking. You terrestrials are always joking. There are things\r\nof which one does not speak."\r\n\r\n"Then take us to the building we\'ve never been allowed inside."\r\n\r\n"You mean the library? No, it would do you no good. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
I am sorry, my\r\nboy." Thor-na\'thor always addressed the two earth-men as "my boy"\r\nthough only heaven knew what the temporal relationship between them\r\nwas. "It is impossible."\r\n\r\n"You can have this too if you\'ll only tell us the secret," Frost said.\r\nHe brought out a power generator, a model of compactness, less than\r\nthirty centimeters on a side, with a sealed-in permanent power source,\r\nand added it to the stereo projector.\r\n\r\nThor-na\'thor listened politely while Frost explained the generator\'s\r\nworking and use, and at the end shook his head once more. "No. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
I am\r\nsorry, there is no secret. No." He nodded good-by to both of them, and\r\nstarted toward the airlock.\r\n\r\n"Hey!" Scott shouted after him. And then, when he turned, "take the\r\nprojector with you!"\r\n\r\n"But--"\r\n\r\n"It\'s okay. We want you to have it. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
It\'s a gift."\r\n\r\nWhen Thor-na\'thor, holding the projector carefully between his hands,\r\nhad departed, Frost turned on Scott.\r\n\r\n"What the heck did you do that for?" he demanded. "Are you crazy? He\r\nwanted that projector; it\'s possible we might have been able to make a\r\ndeal with him after all."\r\n\r\n"You know we wouldn\'t. And--oh, he made me feel so cussed small when\r\nhe said that about having thought it was a gift. I could\'ve hidden\r\nunderneath one of those little blue Martian geckos. And besides, the\r\nold buzzard\'s pretty decent. Likeable."\r\n\r\n"Hunh! You\'d better get into a different frame of mind before tonight,\r\nthen. Maybe I\'d better try it by myself."\r\n\r\n"No. I\'ll back you up."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nScott whispered to Frost, "Funny sort of library. People go in and\r\npeople come out, but none of them is carrying anything. Of course, it\r\ncould be the books don\'t circulate."\r\n\r\n"It could be Thor-na\'thor was lying, you mean." Frost whispered back.\r\n"It\'s not a library, it\'s the place where the Vardians go for their\r\nshots or what. Thor-na\'thor must think we\'re awful fools."\r\n\r\nScott made no reply. He was shivering. The nights on Vardia in this\r\nlatitude had a penetrating chill, and they had been waiting behind the\r\ngelid marble of the monument for Thor-na\'thor for several hours. The\r\nVardians were addicted to routine, but Scott was beginning to wonder\r\nif something had prevented their official host from taking his regular\r\nevening stroll. Scott wished he had worn a heated suit.\r\n\r\n"I think--" Frost said at last. "Yes, here he comes. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
And he\'s by\r\nhimself."\r\n\r\nAs the Vardian moved past the base of the monument to Trj Doteon, the\r\ntwo earth-men fell in on either side of him.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve got you centered," Frost said into the Vardian\'s ear.\r\n\r\n"What do you want me to do?" Thor-na\'thor answered placidly.\r\n\r\n"Go with us to the ship."\r\n\r\nWhen they were inside the _Alceste\'s_ cabin again, Frost said,\r\n"You forced this on us. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
I hope you\'ll decide to be reasonable. Do you\r\nknow what a sliver gun is?"\r\n\r\n"I have not that honor," Thor-na\'thor replied. His expression was\r\npeculiar; whatever it expressed, he did not appear to be alarmed.\r\n\r\nStill centering the Vardian in his bolter, Frost got out a sliver gun\r\nfrom a locker and pointed it at the Vardian.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Frost got out a sliver gun from a locker and pointed it\r\nat Thor-na\'thor.]\r\n\r\n"Little but mighty," he said. "Thor-na\'thor, this is it. Being shot by\r\na sliver gun is rarely fatal, unless you\'re hit in a nerve center. But\r\na wound from it produces tonic spasms of all the voluntary muscles. I\r\nwas shot by one once; I\'d rather have a major burn without anesthesia.\r\n\r\n"Scott, hold out his hand."\r\n\r\nScott locked the Vardian\'s wrist in a tight grip and held the member\r\nout to Frost.\r\n\r\n"Now," Frost said. "Why don\'t you Vardians die?"\r\n\r\nThor-na\'thor laughed. "Torture, my boy?" he said. "It is too bad, I am\r\nafraid I shall look ridiculous. But there is no secret. You are too\r\nyoung to understand."\r\n\r\nFrost drew a deep breath. His finger wavered on the lever of the sliver\r\ngun. Then he tossed the gun down on the cover of the locker and turned\r\nbitterly on his heel.\r\n\r\nScott released the Vardian\'s wrist. "As I thought," he said. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
"You\'d\r\nbetter go, Thor-na\'thor. I imagine we\'ll be starting back to Terra in a\r\nfew hours."\r\n\r\n"So soon?" the Vardian asked courteously. "We Vardians should like an\r\nopportunity to say farewell properly to our guests."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid so. I wish--"\r\n\r\n"Would you like me to give you the projector back? You do not need to\r\nbe ashamed; it is a very valuable thing.

=== Chunk 12 ===
"\r\n\r\n"No, not that. I was wishing that the all-earth Central Committee would\r\ndecide to send a commission to Vardia to investigate this business\r\nabout Vardians never dying. But it\'s impossible; the committee has a\r\ngreat respect for local autonomy."\r\n\r\nHandshakes, at Thor-na\'thor\'s request, were exchanged. 

=== Chunk 13 ===
Their parting\r\nwas friendly. As the _Alceste_ took off on the first leg of the\r\nlong return, Frost said: "I wonder what it was?"\r\n\r\nScott shook his head. "There might have been something. But we\'ll never\r\nknow."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThor-na\'thor walked up the broad low steps of the library. He tipped\r\nback his head to look at the inscription over the big door; it was in\r\nthe long-obsolete non-phonetic Vardian script, but he knew what it said.\r\n\r\nAt the threshold an attendant smiled at him and held out a basin for\r\nhim to wash his hands. The attendants knew him well by sight, since his\r\nvisits to the library always exceeded the daily minimum prescribed by\r\nlaw; Thor-na\'thor was a pious man.\r\n\r\nWhen he was clean, he passed into the enormous adytum. He paused at the\r\nentrance to enjoy the deep pleasure which the sight of the vast room\r\nalways roused in him.\r\n\r\nFrom ceiling to floor it was lined with books; the biographies,\r\nlovingly, piously compiled, of every man, woman and child who had\r\never lived on Vardia since the enormously distant time when the art\r\nof writing had come to the race. Two balconies zoned the room, and\r\neverywhere were reading desks.\r\n\r\nThor-na\'thor approached one of the librarians. He walked slowly, for he\r\nwas thinking of what he had read above the door, "No one who ever lived\r\ndeserves to die," and feeling for the thousandth time its deep truth.\r\n\r\nThe librarian greeted him courteously. "Will you have one of your\r\nfriends," she asked, "or shall it be a stranger?"\r\n\r\n"A stranger," Thor-na\'thor replied without hesitation. It was\r\nconsidered far more pious to peruse a stranger\'s life than that of one\r\nof one\'s friends.\r\n\r\nShe went to a shelf, handed him a book. "No one has had this for a long\r\ntime."\r\n\r\nThor-na\'thor went over with it to a reading desk. He opened it,\r\nsavoring to the full his grateful task of rescuing from oblivion one of\r\nthe honored Vardian dead.\r\n\r\n"Habor-binhabor," he read in the second chapter, "was inordinately\r\nfond of the old-fashioned game of matzor. On the ninth of Satatius,\r\n20034, he stayed up until after midnight playing it, and on another\r\noccasion."\r\n\r\nThor-na\'thor closed the volume over his forefinger. How strange the\r\nearth people were, he thought, how violent, how crude, how young!\r\nHeartless, too--witness how they had let their comrade Kynaston\r\ndie utterly. There had been not the slightest attempt to write his\r\nbiography. Perhaps, as their race grew older, they would learn that\r\nthe whole purpose of man on earth is to keep alive the memory of\r\nthe honored dead. Perhaps they would learn then that no one who is\r\nremembered ever dies.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
