]\r\n\r\n\r\nBy putting himself into reverse, the doom-intended man left the\r\ntwentieth century far ahead. Nineteen fifty-six was a good year to\r\nget out of. John Arthur Benn watched the roaring twenties go by, and\r\nthe gay nineties, backwards, and wondered how it would be to pilot a\r\nriverboat on the Mississippi, or to fight under John Paul Jones.\r\n\r\nBefore he was really aware of it, he was for a speeding second a\r\ncontemporary of another John--Smith--and thought about the life of the\r\nRedman before the colonists began changing things around. By that time\r\nthe scenery had begun to get monotonous--just shrinking trees--and John\r\nArthur Benn swung over into lateral. Ah, England.\r\n\r\nThere went another namesake--Ben Jonson--and in a very little while he\r\nconsidered slowing down to meet still another. But King Arthur flashed\r\npast and into a womb in West Wales just as John was convulsed by a\r\nsneeze (it was quite drafty and he should have dressed more warmly),\r\nand as he stuffed his handkerchief back in his pocket he caught just a\r\ntantalizing glimpse of an interesting Druid ceremony.\r\n\r\nJohn Arthur Benn blacked out somewhere in the limbo of the\r\npre-Christian era, as he'd been warned he might, and when he came to\r\nhe found himself lying in a rather uncomfortable heap with his head\r\nin a mushroom patch. The mushrooms and the trees around him weren't\r\nshrinking any more, so John knew he'd stopped--or at least was going\r\nvery slowly. After a while he decided he wasn't going at all, and got\r\nto his feet.\r\n\r\nIt seemed very pleasant here, in the woods, so he found a fallen tree\r\nto sit on and took a wrapped sandwich and a small vacuum bottle of\r\ncoffee out of his pocket. When he'd finished his meal he walked to a\r\nstream nearby, rinsed the bottle, tossed the waxed paper onto the water\r\nto be carried away and pocketed the vacuum bottle.\r\n\r\nNow, he thought, what? This was scarcely dinosaur country. At this\r\npoint a wild boar chased him up a tree. To be killed by a boar would\r\nbe ignominious, after all this, although the animal was well enough\r\ntusked to have done the job, and so John Arthur Benn climbed to a high\r\nbranch, where the boar's persistence forced him to spend the night.\r\nHe slept, somehow, and, with the closing of his conscious mind--the\r\none that wanted to meet a dinosaur in fatal combat--the conventional\r\nsubconscious, which also sought suicide, but in a more familiar way,\r\nshifted him out of reverse.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke, he was back in 1956, in Philadelphia. Irrevocably, John\r\nArthur Benn knew.\r\n\r\nHe went home and hanged himself in a closet.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
