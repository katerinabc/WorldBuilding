They\'d paid through the\r\nnose to get him here, and they meant to get their money\'s worth.\r\n\r\nThe exit led only to a little balcony, but it seemed to be deserted. He\r\ntook a deep breath of the night air and his eyes moved unconsciously\r\ntoward the stars.\r\n\r\nComing back to Earth had been a mistake, but he\'d needed the\r\nmoney. Space Products Unlimited wanted a real deepspace hero to\r\nhelp celebrate its hundredth anniversary. He had just finished the\r\nRegulation of Rigel, so he\'d been picked.

Damn them and their silly\r\nspeeches and awards--and damn Earth! What was one planet when there\r\nwere a billion up there among the stars?\r\n\r\nFrom the other side of a potted plant there was a soft sigh.\r\n\r\nClifton swung his head, then relaxed as he saw the other man was not\r\nlooking at him. The eyes behind the dark glasses were directed toward\r\nthe sky.\r\n\r\n"Aldebaran, Sirius, Deneb, Alpha Centauri," the voice whispered. It\r\nwas a high-pitched voice with an odd accent, but there was the poetry\r\nof ancient yearning in it.\r\n\r\nHe was a small, shriveled old man. His shoulders were bent. A long\r\nbeard and the dark glasses covered most of his face, but could not\r\nentirely conceal the deep wrinkles, even in the moonlight.\r\n\r\nClifton felt a sudden touch of pity and moved closer, without quite\r\nknowing why. "Didn\'t I see you on the platform?"\r\n\r\n"Your memory is very good, Captain. I was awarded publicly--for fifty\r\nyears of faithful service making space boots. Well, I was always a\r\ngood cobbler, and perhaps my boots helped some men out there." The old\r\nman\'s hand swept toward the stars, then fell back to grip the railing\r\ntightly. "They gave me a gold watch, though time means nothing to me.\r\nAnd a cheap world cruise ticket. As if there were any spot on this\r\nworld I could still want to see."

He laughed harshly. "Forgive me if I\r\nsound bitter. But, you see, I\'ve never been off Earth!"\r\n\r\nClifton stared at him incredulously. "But everyone--"\r\n\r\n"Everyone but me," the old man said. "Oh, I tried. I was utterly weary\r\nof Earth and I looked at the stars and dreamed. But I failed the early\r\nrigid physicals. Then, when things were easier, I tried again. A\r\nplague grounded the first ship. A strike delayed another. Then one\r\nexploded on the pad and only a few on board were saved. It was then I\r\nrealized I was meant to wait here--here on Earth, and nowhere else. So\r\nI stayed, making space boots."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPity and impulse forced unexpected words to Clifton\'s lips. "I\'m taking\r\noff for Rigel again in four hours, and there\'s a spare cabin on the\r\n_Maryloo_. You\'re coming with me."\r\n\r\nThe old hand that gripped his arm was oddly gentle. "Bless you,\r\nCaptain.

But it would never work. I\'m under orders to remain here."\r\n\r\n"Nobody can order a man grounded forever. You\'re coming with me if I\r\nhave to drag you, Mr.--"\r\n\r\n"Ahasuerus."\r\n\r\nThe old man hesitated, as if expecting the name to mean something. Then\r\nhe sighed and lifted his dark glasses.\r\n\r\nClifton met the other\'s gaze for less than a second. Then his own eyes\r\ndropped, though memory of what he had seen was already fading. He\r\nvaulted over the balcony railing and began running away from Ahasuerus,\r\ntoward his ship and the unconfined reaches of space.\r\n\r\nBehind him, the eternal wanderer tarried and waited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
