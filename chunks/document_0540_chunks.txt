What a game! Such excitement they hadn\'t\r\nknown in years. The children catapulted this way and that across the\r\ngreen lawns, shouting at each other, holding hands, flying in circles,\r\nclimbing trees, laughing.... Overhead, the rockets flew and beetle-cars\r\nwhispered by on the streets, but the children played on. Such fun, such\r\ntremulous joy, such tumbling and hearty screaming.\r\n\r\nMink ran into the house, all dirt and sweat. For her seven years she\r\nwas loud and strong and definite. Her mother, Mrs. Morris, hardly saw\r\nher as she yanked out drawers and rattled pans and tools into a large\r\nsack.\r\n\r\n"Heavens, Mink, what\'s going on?"\r\n\r\n"The most exciting game ever!" gasped Mink, pink-faced.\r\n\r\n"Stop and get your breath," said the mother.\r\n\r\n"No, I\'m all right," gasped Mink. "Okay I take these things, Mom?"\r\n\r\n"But don\'t dent them," said Mrs. Morris.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, thank you!" cried Mink and boom! she was gone, like a\r\nrocket.\r\n\r\nMrs. Morris surveyed the fleeing tot. "What\'s the name of the game?"\r\n\r\n"Invasion!" said Mink. The door slammed.\r\n\r\nIn every yard on the street children brought out knives and forks and\r\npokers and old stove pipes and can-openers.\r\n\r\nIt was an interesting fact that this fury and bustle occurred only\r\namong the younger children. The older ones, those ten years and more\r\ndisdained the affair and marched scornfully off on hikes or played a\r\nmore dignified version of hide-and-seek on their own.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, parents came and went in chromium beetles. Repair men\r\ncame to repair the vacuum elevators in houses, to fix fluttering\r\ntelevision sets or hammer upon stubborn food-delivery tubes. The\r\nadult civilization passed and repassed the busy youngsters, jealous\r\nof the fierce energy of the wild tots, tolerantly amused at their\r\nflourishings, longing to join in themselves.\r\n\r\n"This and this and _this_," said Mink, instructing the others with\r\ntheir assorted spoons and wrenches. "Do that, and bring _that_ over\r\nhere. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
No! _Here_, ninnie! Right. Now, get back while I fix this--"\r\nTongue in teeth, face wrinkled in thought. "Like that. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
See?"\r\n\r\n"Yayyyy!" shouted the kids.\r\n\r\nTwelve-year-old Joseph Connors ran up.\r\n\r\n"Go away," said Mink straight at him.\r\n\r\n"I wanna play," said Joseph.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t!" said Mink.\r\n\r\n"Why not?"\r\n\r\n"You\'d just make fun of us."\r\n\r\n"Honest, I wouldn\'t."\r\n\r\n"No. We know _you_. Go away or we\'ll kick you."\r\n\r\nAnother twelve-year-old boy whirred by on little motor-skates. "Aye,\r\nJoe! 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Come on! Let them sissies play!"\r\n\r\nJoseph showed reluctance and a certain wistfulness. "I _want_ to play,"\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\n"You\'re old," said Mink, firmly.\r\n\r\n"Not _that_ old," said Joe sensibly.\r\n\r\n"You\'d only laugh and spoil the Invasion."\r\n\r\nThe boy on the motor-skates made a rude lip noise. "Come on, Joe! Them\r\nand their fairies! Nuts!"\r\n\r\nJoseph walked off slowly. He kept looking back, all down the block.\r\n\r\nMink was already busy again. She made a kind of apparatus with her\r\ngathered equipment. She had appointed another little girl with a pad\r\nand pencil to take down notes in painful slow scribbles. Their voices\r\nrose and fell in the warm sunlight.\r\n\r\nAll around them the city hummed. The streets were lined with good\r\ngreen and peaceful trees. Only the wind made a conflict across the\r\ncity, across the country, across the continent. In a thousand other\r\ncities there were trees and children and avenues, business men in their\r\nquiet offices taping their voices, or watching televisors. Rockets\r\nhovered like darning needles in the blue sky. There was the universal,\r\nquiet conceit and easiness of men accustomed to peace, quite certain\r\nthere would never be trouble again. Arm in arm, men all over earth\r\nwere a united front. The perfect weapons were held in equal trust by\r\nall nations. A situation of incredibly beautiful balance had been\r\nbrought about. There were no traitors among men, no unhappy ones, no\r\ndisgruntled ones; therefore the world was based upon a stable ground.\r\nSunlight illumined half the world and the trees drowsed in a tide of\r\nwarm air.\r\n\r\nMink\'s mother, from her upstairs window, gazed down.\r\n\r\nThe children.\r\n\r\nShe looked upon them and shook her head. Well, they\'d eat well, sleep\r\nwell, and be in school on Monday. Bless their vigorous little bodies.\r\nShe listened.\r\n\r\nMink talked earnestly to someone near the rose-bush--though there was\r\nno one there.\r\n\r\nThese odd children. And the little girl, what was her name? Anna? Anna\r\ntook notes on a pad. First, Mink asked the rose-bush a question, then\r\ncalled the answer to Anna.\r\n\r\n"Triangle," said Mink.\r\n\r\n"What\'s a tri," said Anna with difficulty, "angle?"\r\n\r\n"Never mind," said Mink.\r\n\r\n"How you spell it?" asked Anna.\r\n\r\n"T-R-I--" spelled Mink, slowly, then snapped, "Oh, spell it yourself!"\r\nShe went on to other words. "Beam," she said.\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t got tri," said Anna, "angle down yet!"\r\n\r\n"Well, hurry, hurry!" cried Mink.\r\n\r\nMink\'s mother leaned out the upstairs window. "A-N-G-L-E," she spelled\r\ndown at Anna.\r\n\r\n"Oh, thanks, Mrs. Morris," said Anna.\r\n\r\n"Certainly," said Mink\'s mother and withdrew, laughing, to dust the\r\nhall with an electro-duster-magnet.\r\n\r\nThe voices wavered on the shimmery air. "Beam," said Anna. Fading.\r\n\r\n"Four-nine-seven-A-and-B-and-X," said Mink, far away, seriously. "And a\r\nfork and a string and a--hex-hex-agony ... hexagon_al_!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt lunch, Mink gulped milk at one toss and was at the door. Her mother\r\nslapped the table.\r\n\r\n"You sit right back down," commanded Mrs. Morris. "Hot soup in a\r\nminute." She poked a red button on the kitchen butler and ten seconds\r\nlater something landed with a bump in the rubber receiver. Mrs. Morris\r\nopened it, took out a can with a pair of aluminum holders, unsealed it\r\nwith a flick and poured hot soup into a bowl.\r\n\r\nDuring all this, Mink fidgeted. "Hurry, Mom! 

=== Chunk 5 ===
This is a matter of life\r\nand death! Aw--!"\r\n\r\n"I was the same way at your age. Always life and death. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
I know."\r\n\r\nMink banged away at the soup.\r\n\r\n"Slow down," said Mom.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t," said Mink. "Drill\'s waiting for me."\r\n\r\n"Who\'s Drill? What a peculiar name," said Mom.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t know him," said Mink.\r\n\r\n"A new boy in the neighborhood?" asked Mom.\r\n\r\n"He\'s new all right," said Mink. She started on her second bowl.\r\n\r\n"Which one is Drill?" asked Mom.\r\n\r\n"He\'s around," said Mink, evasively. "You\'ll make fun. Everybody pokes\r\nfun. Gee, darn."\r\n\r\n"Is Drill shy?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. No. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
In a way. Gosh, Mom, I got to run if we want to have the\r\nInvasion!"\r\n\r\n"Who\'s invading what?"\r\n\r\n"Martians invading Earth--well, not exactly Martians. They\'re--I don\'t\r\nknow. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
From up." She pointed with her spoon.\r\n\r\n"And _inside_," said Mom, touching Mink\'s feverish brow.\r\n\r\nMink rebelled. "You\'re laughing! You\'ll kill Drill and _every_body."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t mean to," said Mom. "Drill\'s a Martian?"\r\n\r\n"No. He\'s--well--maybe from Jupiter or Saturn or Venus. Anyway, he\'s\r\nhad a hard time."\r\n\r\n"I imagine." 

=== Chunk 9 ===
Mrs. Morris hid her mouth behind her hand.\r\n\r\n"They couldn\'t figure a way to attack earth."\r\n\r\n"We\'re impregnable," said Mom, in mock-seriousness.\r\n\r\n"That\'s the word Drill used! Impreg--That was the word, Mom."\r\n\r\n"My, my. Drill\'s a brilliant little boy. Two-bit words."\r\n\r\n"They couldn\'t figure a way to attack, Mom. Drill says--he says in\r\norder to make a good fight you got to have a new way of surprising\r\npeople. That way you win. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
And he says also you got to have help from\r\nyour enemy."\r\n\r\n"A fifth column," said Mom.\r\n\r\n"Yeah. That\'s what Drill said. And they couldn\'t figure a way to\r\nsurprise Earth or get help."\r\n\r\n"No wonder. We\'re pretty darn strong," laughed Mom, cleaning up. Mink\r\nsat there, staring at the table, seeing what she was talking about.\r\n\r\n"Until, one day," whispered Mink, melodramatically, "they thought of\r\nchildren!"\r\n\r\n"_Well!_" said Mrs. Morris brightly.\r\n\r\n"And they thought of how grown-ups are so busy they never look under\r\nrose-bushes or on lawns!"\r\n\r\n"Only for snails and fungus."\r\n\r\n"And then there\'s something about dim-dims."\r\n\r\n"Dim-dims?"\r\n\r\n"Dimens-shuns."\r\n\r\n"Dimensions?"\r\n\r\n"Four of \'em! And there\'s something about kids under nine and\r\nimagination. It\'s real funny to hear Drill talk."\r\n\r\nMrs. Morris was tired. "Well, it must be funny. You\'re keeping Drill\r\nwaiting now. It\'s getting late in the day and, if you want to have your\r\nInvasion before your supper bath, you\'d better jump."\r\n\r\n"Do I have to take a bath?" growled Mink.\r\n\r\n"You do. Why is it children hate water? No matter what age you live in\r\nchildren hate water behind the ears!"\r\n\r\n"Drill says I won\'t have to take baths," said Mink.\r\n\r\n"Oh, he does, does he?"\r\n\r\n"He told all the kids that. No more baths. And we can stay up till ten\r\no\'clock and go to two televisor shows on Saturday \'stead of one!"\r\n\r\n"Well, Mr. Drill better mind his p\'s and q\'s. I\'ll call up his mother\r\nand--"\r\n\r\nMink went to the door. "We\'re having trouble with guys like Pete Britz\r\nand Dale Jerrick. They\'re growing up. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
They make fun. They\'re worse than\r\nparents. They just won\'t believe in Drill. They\'re so snooty, cause\r\nthey\'re growing up. You\'d think they\'d know better. They were little\r\nonly a coupla years ago. I hate them worst. We\'ll kill them _first_."\r\n\r\n"Your father and I, last?"\r\n\r\n"Drill says you\'re dangerous. Know why? 

=== Chunk 12 ===
Cause you don\'t believe in\r\nMartians! They\'re going to let _us_ run the world. Well, not just us,\r\nbut the kids over in the next block, too. I might be queen." She opened\r\nthe door. "Mom?"\r\n\r\n"Yes?"\r\n\r\n"What\'s--lodge ... ick?"\r\n\r\n"Logic? Why, dear, logic is knowing what things are true and not true."\r\n\r\n"He _mentioned_ that," said Mink. "And what\'s im--pres--sion--able?" It\r\ntook her a minute to say it.\r\n\r\n"Why, it means--" Her mother looked at the floor, laughing gently. "It\r\nmeans--to be a child, dear."\r\n\r\n"Thanks for lunch!" Mink ran out, then stuck her head back in. "Mom,\r\nI\'ll be sure you won\'t be hurt, much, really!"\r\n\r\n"Well, thanks," said Mom.\r\n\r\n_Slam_ went the door.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt four o\'clock the audio-visor buzzed. Mrs. Morris flipped the tab.\r\n"Hello, Helen!" she said, in welcome.\r\n\r\n"Hello, Mary. How are things in New York?"\r\n\r\n"Fine, how are things in Scranton? You look tired."\r\n\r\n"So do you. The children. Underfoot," said Helen.\r\n\r\nMrs. Morris sighed, "My Mink, too. The super Invasion."\r\n\r\nHelen laughed. "Are your kids playing that game, too?"\r\n\r\n"Lord, yes. Tomorrow it\'ll be geometrical jacks and motorized\r\nhopscotch. Were we this bad when we were kids in \'48?"\r\n\r\n"Worse. Japs and Nazis. Don\'t know how my parents put up with me.\r\nTomboy."\r\n\r\n"Parents learn to shut their ears."\r\n\r\nA silence.\r\n\r\n"What\'s wrong, Mary?" asked Helen.\r\n\r\nMrs. Morris\' eyes were half-closed; her tongue slid slowly,\r\nthoughtfully over her lower lip. "Eh," She jerked. 

=== Chunk 13 ===
"Oh, nothing. Just\r\nthought about _that_. Shutting ears and such. Never mind. Where were\r\nwe?"\r\n\r\n"My boy Tim\'s got a crush on some guy named--_Drill_, I think it was."\r\n\r\n"Must be a new password. Mink likes him, too."\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t know it got as far as New York. Word of mouth, I imagine. 

=== Chunk 14 ===
Looks\r\nlike a scrap drive. I talked to Josephine and she said her kids--that\'s\r\nin Boston--are wild on this new game. It\'s sweeping the country."\r\n\r\nAt this moment, Mink trotted into the kitchen to gulp a glass of water.\r\nMrs. Morris turned. "How\'re things going?"\r\n\r\n"Almost finished," said Mink.\r\n\r\n"Swell," said Mrs. Morris. "What\'s _that_?"\r\n\r\n"A yo-yo," said Mink. "Watch."\r\n\r\nShe flung the yo-yo down its string. Reaching the end it--\r\n\r\nIt vanished.\r\n\r\n"See?" said Mink. 

=== Chunk 15 ===
"Ope!" Dibbling her finger she made the yo-yo\r\nreappear and zip up the string.\r\n\r\n"Do that again," said her mother.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t. Zero hour\'s five o\'clock! \'Bye."\r\n\r\nMink exited, zipping her yo-yo.\r\n\r\nOn the audio-visor, Helen laughed. "Tim brought one of those yo-yo\'s in\r\nthis morning, but when I got curious he said he wouldn\'t show it to me,\r\nand when I tried to work it, finally, it wouldn\'t work."\r\n\r\n"You\'re not _impressionable_," said Mrs. Morris.\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"Never mind. 

=== Chunk 16 ===
Something I thought of. 

=== Chunk 17 ===
Can I help you, Helen?"\r\n\r\n"I wanted to get that black-and-white cake recipe--"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe hour drowsed by. The day waned. 

=== Chunk 18 ===
The sun lowered in the peaceful\r\nblue sky. Shadows lengthened on the green lawns. The laughter and\r\nexcitement continued. One little girl ran away, crying.\r\n\r\nMrs. Morris came out the front door.\r\n\r\n"Mink, was that Peggy Ann crying?"\r\n\r\nMink was bent over in the yard, near the rose-bush. "Yeah. She\'s a\r\nscarebaby. We won\'t let her play, now. She\'s getting too old to play. I\r\nguess she grew up all of a sudden."\r\n\r\n"Is that why she cried? Nonsense. Give me a civil answer, young lady,\r\nor inside you come!"\r\n\r\nMink whirled in consternation, mixed with irritation. "I can\'t quit\r\nnow. It\'s almost time. I\'ll be good. 

=== Chunk 19 ===
I\'m sorry."\r\n\r\n"Did you hit Peggy Ann?"\r\n\r\n"No, honest. You ask her. 

=== Chunk 20 ===
It was something--well, she\'s just a\r\nscaredy-pants."\r\n\r\nThe ring of children drew in around Mink where she scowled at her work\r\nwith spoons and a kind of square shaped arrangement of hammers and\r\npipes. "There and there," murmured Mink.\r\n\r\n"What\'s wrong?" said Mrs. Morris.\r\n\r\n"Drill\'s stuck. Half way. If we could only get him all the way through,\r\nit\'ll be easier. Then all the others could come through after him."\r\n\r\n"Can I help?"\r\n\r\n"No\'m, thanks. I\'ll fix it."\r\n\r\n"All right. I\'ll call you for your bath in half an hour. I\'m tired of\r\nwatching you."\r\n\r\nShe went in and sat in the electric-relaxing chair, sipping a little\r\nbeer from a half-empty glass. The chair massaged her back. Children,\r\nchildren. Children and love and hate, side by side. Sometimes children\r\nloved you, hated you, all in half a second. Strange children, did they\r\never forget or forgive the whippings and the harsh, strict words of\r\ncommand? She wondered. How can you ever forget or forgive those over\r\nand above you, those tall and silly dictators?\r\n\r\nTime passed. A curious, waiting silence came upon the street, deepening.\r\n\r\nFive o\'clock. A clock sang softly somewhere in the house, in a quiet,\r\nmusical voice, "Five o\'clock ... five o\'clock. Time\'s a wasting. Five\r\no\'clock," and purred away into silence.\r\n\r\nZero hour.\r\n\r\nMrs. Morris chuckled in her throat. Zero hour.\r\n\r\nA beetle-car hummed into the driveway. Mr. 

=== Chunk 21 ===
Morris. Mrs. Morris smiled.\r\nMr. Morris got out of the beetle, locked it and called hello to Mink at\r\nher work. Mink ignored him. He laughed and stood for a moment watching\r\nthe children in their business. Then he walked up the front steps.\r\n\r\n"Hello, darling."\r\n\r\n"Hello, Henry."\r\n\r\nShe strained forward on the edge of the chair, listening. The children\r\nwere silent. Too silent.\r\n\r\nHe emptied his pipe, refilled it. "Swell day. Makes you glad to be\r\nalive."\r\n\r\nBuzz.\r\n\r\n"What\'s that?" asked Henry.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know." She got up, suddenly, her eyes widening. She was going\r\nto say something. She stopped it. Ridiculous. Her nerves jumped. "Those\r\nchildren haven\'t anything dangerous out there, have they?" she said.\r\n\r\n"Nothing but pipes and hammers. Why?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing electrical?"\r\n\r\n"Heck, no," said Henry. "I looked."\r\n\r\nShe walked to the kitchen. The buzzing continued. "Just the same\r\nyou\'d better go tell them to quit. It\'s after five. Tell them--" Her\r\neyes widened and narrowed. "Tell them to put off their Invasion until\r\ntomorrow." She laughed, nervously.\r\n\r\nThe buzzing grew louder.\r\n\r\n"What are they up to? I\'d better go look, all right."\r\n\r\nThe explosion!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe house shook with dull sound. There were other explosions in other\r\nyards on other streets.\r\n\r\nInvoluntarily, Mrs. Morris screamed. "Up this way!" she cried,\r\nsenselessly, knowing no sense, no reason. Perhaps she saw something\r\nfrom the corners of her eyes, perhaps she smelled a new odor or heard\r\na new noise. There was no time to argue with Henry to convince him.\r\nLet him think her insane. Yes, insane! Shrieking, she ran upstairs. He\r\nran after her to see what she was up to. "In the attic!" she screamed.\r\n"That\'s where it is!" It was only a poor excuse to get him in the attic\r\nin time--oh God, in time!\r\n\r\nAnother explosion outside. The children screamed with delight, as if at\r\na great fireworks display.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not in the attic!" cried Henry. "It\'s outside!"\r\n\r\n"No, no!" Wheezing, gasping, she fumbled at the attic door. "I\'ll show\r\nyou. Hurry! I\'ll show you!"\r\n\r\nThey tumbled into the attic. She slammed the door, locked it, took the\r\nkey, threw it into a far, cluttered corner.\r\n\r\nShe was babbling wild stuff now. It came out of her. All the\r\nsubconscious suspicion and fear that had gathered secretly all\r\nafternoon and fermented like a wine in her. All the little revelations\r\nand knowledges and sense that had bothered her all day and which she\r\nhad logically and carefully and sensibly rejected and censored. Now it\r\nexploded in her and shook her to bits.\r\n\r\n"There, there," she said, sobbing against the door. "We\'re safe until\r\ntonight. Maybe we can sneak out, maybe we can escape!"\r\n\r\nHenry blew up, too, but for another reason. "Are you crazy? Why\'d you\r\nthrow that key away! Damn it, honey!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, I\'m crazy, if it helps, but stay here with me!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know how in hell I _can_ get out!"\r\n\r\n"Quiet. They\'ll hear us. Oh, God, they\'ll find us soon enough--"\r\n\r\nBelow them, Mink\'s voice. The husband stopped. There was a great\r\nuniversal humming and sizzling, a screaming and giggling. Downstairs,\r\nthe audio-televisor buzzed and buzzed insistently, alarmingly,\r\nviolently. _Is that Helen calling?_ thought Mrs. Morris. _And is she\r\ncalling about what I_ think _she\'s calling about_?\r\n\r\nFootsteps came into the house. Heavy footsteps.\r\n\r\n"Who\'s coming in my house?" demanded Henry, angrily. "Who\'s tramping\r\naround down there?"\r\n\r\nHeavy feet. Twenty, thirty, forty, fifty of them. Fifty persons\r\ncrowding into the house. The humming. The giggling of the children.\r\n"This way!" cried Mink, below.\r\n\r\n"Who\'s downstairs?" roared Henry. "Who\'s there!"\r\n\r\n"Hush, oh, nonononono!" said his wife, weakly, holding him. "Please, be\r\nquiet. They might go away."\r\n\r\n"Mom?" called Mink, "Dad?" A pause. 

=== Chunk 22 ===
"Where are you?"\r\n\r\nHeavy footsteps, heavy, heavy, _very_ HEAVY footsteps came up the\r\nstairs. Mink leading them.\r\n\r\n"Mom?" A hesitation. "Dad?" A waiting, a silence.\r\n\r\nHumming. Footsteps toward the attic. Mink\'s first.\r\n\r\nThey trembled together in silence in the attic, Mr. and Mrs. Morris.\r\nFor some reason the electric humming, the queer cold light suddenly\r\nvisible under the door crack, the strange odor and the alien sound of\r\neagerness in Mink\'s voice, finally got through to Henry Morris, too. He\r\nstood, shivering, in the dark silence, his wife beside him.\r\n\r\n"Mom! Dad!"\r\n\r\nFootsteps. A little humming sound. The attic lock melted. The door\r\nopened. Mink peered inside, tall blue shadows behind her.\r\n\r\n"Peek-a-boo," said Mink.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
