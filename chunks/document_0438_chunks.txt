COBLENTZ\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nNothing was further from my mind, when I discovered the "Release Drug"\r\nRelin, than the realization that it would lead me through as strange and\r\nghastly and revealing a series of adventures as any man has ever\r\nexperienced. I encountered it, in a way, as a mere by-product of my\r\nexperiments; I am a chemist by profession, and as one of the staff of\r\nthe Morganstern Foundation have access to some of the best equipped\r\nlaboratories in America. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
The startling new invention--I must call it\r\nthat, though I did not create it deliberately--came to me in the course\r\nof my investigations into the obscure depths of the human personality.\r\n\r\nIt has long been my theory that there is in man a psychic entity which\r\ncan exist for at least brief periods apart from the body, and have\r\nperceptions which are not those of the physical senses. In accordance\r\nwith these views, I had been developing various drugs, compounded of\r\nmorphine and adrenalin, whose object was to shock the psychic entity\r\nloose for limited periods and so to widen the range and powers of the\r\npersonality. I shall not go into the details of my researches, nor tell\r\nby what accident I succeeded better than I had hoped; the all-important\r\nfact--a fact so overwhelming that I shudder and gasp and marvel even as\r\nI tell of it--is that I did obtain a minute quantity of a drug which, by\r\nputting the body virtually in a state of suspended animation, could\r\nrelease the mind to travel almost at will across time and space.\r\n\r\nYes, across time and space!--for the drag of the physical having been\r\nstricken off, I could enter literally into infinity and eternity. But\r\nlet me tell precisely what happened that night when at precisely 10:08\r\nin the solitude of my apartment room, I swallowed half an ounce of Relin\r\nand stretched myself out on the bed, well knowing that I was taking\r\nincalculable risks, and that insanity and even death were by no means\r\nremote possibilities of the road ahead. But let that be as it may! In my\r\nopinion, there is no coward more despicable than he who will not face\r\ndanger for the sake of knowledge.\r\n\r\nMy head reeled, and something seemed to buzz inside it as soon as the\r\nbitter half ounce of fluid slipped down my throat. I was barely able to\r\nreach the bed and throw myself upon it when there came a snapping as of\r\nsomething inside my brain ... then, for a period, blankness ... then a\r\ngradual awakening with that feeling of exhilaration one experiences only\r\nafter the most blissful sleep. I opened my eyes, feeling strong and\r\nlight of limb and charged with a marvelous vital energy--but, as I\r\npeered about me, my lips drew far apart in astonishment, and I am sure\r\nthat I gaped like one who has seen a ghost.\r\n\r\nWhere were the familiar walls of my two-by-four room, the bureau, the\r\nbook-rack, the ancient portrait of Pasteur that hung in its glass frame\r\njust above the foot of the bed? Gone!

vanished as utterly as though they\r\nhad never been! I was standing on a wide and windy plain, with the gale\r\nbeating in my ears, and with rapid sunset-colored clouds scudding\r\nacross the blood-stained west. Mingled with the wailing of the blast,\r\nthere was a deep sobbing sound that struck me in successive waves, like\r\nthe ululations of great multitudes of far-off mourners. And while I was\r\nwondering what this might mean and felt a prickling of horror along my\r\nspine, the first of the portents swept across the sky. I say "portents,"\r\nfor I do not know by what other term to describe the apparitions; high\r\nin the heavens, certainly at an altitude of many miles, the flaming\r\nthing swept across my view, comet-shaped and stretching over at least\r\nten degrees of arc, swift as a meteor, brilliantly flesh-red, sputtering\r\nsparks like an anvil, and leaving behind it a long ruddy trail that only\r\nslowly faded out amid the darkening skies.\r\n\r\nIt must have been a full minute after its disappearance before the\r\nhissing of its flight came to my ears--a hissing so sharp, so nastily\r\ninsistent that it reached me even above the noise of the wind. And more\r\nthan another minute had passed before the earth beneath me was wrenched\r\nand jarred as if by an earthquake and the most thunderous detonations I\r\nhad ever heard burst over me in a prolonged series.\r\n\r\nLet me emphasize that none of this had the quality of a dream; it was\r\nclear-cut, as vivid as anything I had ever experienced; my mind worked\r\nwith an unusual precision and clarity, and not even a fleeting doubt\r\ncame to me of the reality of my observations. "This is some sort of\r\nbombing attack," I remember reflecting, "some assault of super-monsters\r\nof the skies, perfected by a super science." And I did not have to be\r\ntold the fact; I knew, as by an all-illuminating inner knowledge, that I\r\nhad voyaged into the future.\r\n\r\nEven as this realization came to me, I made another flight--and one that\r\nwas in space more than in time. It did not surprise me, but I took it as\r\nthe most natural thing in the world when I seemed to rise and go\r\nfloating away through the air. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
It was still sunset-time, but I could see\r\nclearly enough as I went drifting at a height of several hundred yards\r\nabove a vast desolated space near the junction of two rivers. Perhaps,\r\nhowever, "desolated" is not the word I should use; I should say, rather,\r\n"shattered, pulverized, obliterated," for a scene of more utter and\r\nhopeless ruin I have never seen nor imagined. Over an area of many\r\nsquare miles, there was nothing but heaps and mounds of broken stone,\r\ncharred and crumbling brick, fire-scarred timbers, and huge contorted\r\nmasses of rusting steel like the decaying bones of superhuman monsters.\r\nFrom the great height and extent of the piles of debris, and from the\r\noccasional sight of the splintered cornice of a roof or of some battered\r\nwindow-frame or door, I knew that this had once been a city, one of the\r\nworld\'s greatest; but no other recognizable feature remained amid the\r\ngray masses of ruins, and the very streets and avenues had been erased.\r\nBut here and there a tremendous crater, three hundred feet across and a\r\nhundred to a hundred and fifty feet deep, indicated the source of the\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nAs if to reinforce the dread idea that had taken possession of my\r\nbrain, one of the comet-like red prodigies went streaking across the sky\r\neven as I gazed down at the dead city; and I knew--as clearly as if I\r\nhad seen the whole spectacle with my own eyes--that the missile had\r\nsprung from a source hundreds or thousands of miles away, possibly\r\nacross the ocean; and that, laden with scores of tons of explosives, it\r\nhad been hurled with unerring mechanical accuracy upon its mission of\r\nannihilation.\r\n\r\nThen I seemed to float over vast distances of that sunset-tinted land,\r\nand saw great craters in the fields, and villages shot to ribbons, and\r\nfarms abandoned; and the wild dogs fought for the wild cattle; and\r\nthistles grew deep on acres where wheat had been planted, and weeds\r\nsprouted thickly in the orchards, and blight and mildew competed for the\r\ncrops. But though here and there I could see a dugout, with traces of\r\nfire and abandoned tools flung about at random, nowhere in all that\r\ndismal world did I observe a living man.\r\n\r\nAfter a time I returned to a place near the ruined city by the two\r\nrivers; and in the rocky palisades above one of the streams, I made out\r\nsome small circular holes barely large enough to admit a man. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
And, borne\r\nonward by some impulse of curiosity and despair, I entered one of these\r\nholes, and went downward, far downward into the dim recesses. And now\r\nfor the first time, at a depth of hundreds of yards, I did at last\r\nencounter living men. My first thought was that I had gone back to the\r\nday of the cave-man, for a cave-like hollow had been scooped out in the\r\nsolid rock. It was true that the few hundreds of people huddled together\r\nthere had the dress and looks of moderns; it was true, also, that the\r\ngloom was lighted for them by electric bulbs, and that electric\r\nradiators kept them warm; yet Dante himself, in painting the ninth\r\ncircle of his Inferno, could not have imagined a drearier and more\r\ndespondent group than these that slouched and drooped and muttered in\r\nthat cavernous recess, seated with their heads fallen low upon their\r\nknees, or moodily pacing back and forth like captives who can hope for\r\nno escape. "Here at least we will be safe from the sky marauders," I\r\nheard one of them muttering. Yet I could not help wondering what the\r\nmere safety of the body could mean when all the glories of man\'s\r\ncivilization were annihilated.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThere came a whirring in my head, and another blank interval; and when I\r\nregained my senses I knew that another period of time had passed,\r\npossibly months or even years. I stood on the palisade above the river,\r\nnear the entrance of the caves; and the sun was bright above me; but\r\nthere was no brightness in the men and women that trailed out of a small\r\ncircular hole in the ground. Drab as dock-rats, and pasty pale of\r\ncountenance as hospital inmates, and with bent backs and dirty, tattered\r\nclothes and a mouse-like nosing manner, they emerged with the wariness\r\nof hunted refugees; and they flung up their hands with low cries to\r\nshield them from the brilliance of the sun, to which they were evidently\r\nunaccustomed. From the packs on their backs and the bundles in their\r\nhands, I knew that they were emerging from their subterranean refuge, to\r\ntry to begin a new life in the ravaged world above; and my heart went\r\nout to them, for I saw that, few as they were--not more than fifty in\r\nall--they were the sole survivors of a once-populous region, and would\r\nhave a bitter fight to wage in the man-made wilderness that had been a\r\nworld metropolis.\r\n\r\nBut as they roamed above through the waste of ash and rubble, and as\r\nthey wandered abroad where the fields had been and saw how every brush\r\nand tree had been seared from the earth or poisoned by chemical brews, I\r\nknew that their fight was not merely a bitter one--it was hopeless. And\r\nI heard them muttering among themselves, "We have not even any tools!",\r\nand again, "We have no fuel left for the great machines!" ... For they\r\nhad lived in a highly mechanical world, and the technicians who alone\r\nunderstood the workings of that world had all been destroyed, and the\r\nsources of power had all been cut off--and power was the food without\r\nwhich they could not long survive.\r\n\r\nUnable to endure their haggard, hangdog looks and grim, despondent eyes,\r\nI went wandering far away, over the length and breadth of many lands.\r\nAnd nowhere did I see a factory that had not been hammered to dust, nor\r\na village that had not been unroofed or burnt, nor a farm where the\r\nworkers went humming on their merry, toilsome way. Yet here and there I\r\ndid observe little knots of survivors. Sometimes they were half-clad\r\ngroups, lean and ferocious as famished wolves, who roamed the houseless\r\ncountryside with stones and clubs, hunting the wild birds and hares, or\r\nmaking meager meals from bark and roots. Sometimes three or four men,\r\nwith the frenzied eyes and hysterical shrieks and shouts of maniacs,\r\nwould emerge from a brush hut by a river flat. Sometimes little bands of\r\nmen and women, in a dazed aimless way, would go wandering about a huge\r\njagged hole in the ground, where their homes and their loved ones lay\r\nburied. I came upon solitary refugees high up on the scarred mountain\r\nslopes, with nothing but a staff to lean upon and a deer-skin to keep\r\nthem warm. I saw more than one twisted form lying motionless at the foot\r\nof a precipice. I witnessed a battle between two half-crazed, ravenous\r\nbands, with murder, and cannibalism, and horrors too grisly to report. I\r\nobserved brave men resolutely trying to till the soil, whose productive\r\npowers had been ruined by a poison spray from the sky; and I noted some\r\nwho, though the fields remained fertile enough, had not the seed to\r\nplant; and others who had not the tools with which to plow and reap. And\r\nsome who, with great labor, managed to produce enough for three or four\r\nmouths, had twenty or thirty to feed; and where the three or four might\r\nhave lived, the twenty or thirty perished.\r\n\r\nThen, with a great sadness, I knew that man, having become civilized,\r\ncannot make himself into a savage again. He has come to depend upon\r\nscience for his sustenance, and when he himself has destroyed the means\r\nof employing that science, he is as a babe without milk. And it is not\r\nnecessary to destroy all men in order to exterminate mankind; one need\r\nonly take from him the prop of his mechanical inventions.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nAgain there came a blankness, and I passed over a stretch of time,\r\nperhaps over years or even decades. And I had wandered far in space, to\r\nan island somewhere on a sunny sea; and there once more I heard the\r\nsound of voices. And somehow, through some deeper sense, I knew that\r\nthese were the voices of the only men left anywhere on the whole wide\r\nplanet. And I looked down on them, and saw that they were but few, no\r\nmore than a dozen men and women in all, with three or four children\r\namong them. But their faces, unlike those which I had seen before, were\r\nnot haggard and seamed, nor avid like those of hunting beasts, nor\r\ndistorted by fury or famine. Their brows were broad and noble, and their\r\neyes shone with the sweetness of great thoughts, and their smiles were\r\nas unuttered music; and when they glanced at me with their clear, level\r\ngaze, I knew that they were such beings as poets had pictured as\r\ndwellers in a far tomorrow. And I did not feel sad, though I could not\r\nforget that they were the only things in human form that one could find\r\non all earth\'s shores, and though I knew that they were too few to\r\nperpetuate their kind for long. Somehow I felt some vast benevolent\r\nspirit in control, that these most perfect specimens of our race should\r\nendure when all the wreckers had vanished.\r\n\r\nAs I watched, I saw the people all turning their eyes to an eastern\r\nmountain, whose summit still trailed the golden of the dawn-clouds. And\r\nfrom above the peak a great illuminated sphere, like a chariot of\r\nlight, miraculously came floating down; and the blaze was such that I\r\ncould hardly bear to look at it. And exclamations of wonder and joy came\r\nfrom the people\'s throats; and I too cried out in joy and wonder as the\r\nradiant globe descended, and as it alighted on the plain before us,\r\ncasting a sunlike aura over everything in sight. Then through the sides\r\nof the enormous ball--I would not say, through the door, for nothing of\r\nthe kind was visible--a glorious being emerged, followed by several of\r\nhis kind. He was shaped like a man, and was no taller than a man, and\r\nyet there was that about him which said that he was greater than a man,\r\nfor light seemed to pour from every cell of his body, and a golden halo\r\nwas about his head, and his eyes shot forth golden beams so intense and\r\nso magnetic that, once having observed them, I could hardly take my gaze\r\naway.\r\n\r\nWith slow steps he advanced, motioning the people to him; and they drew\r\nnear, and flung themselves before him on the ground, and cried out in\r\nadoration. And I too threw myself to earth, in worship of this\r\nsuperhuman creature; and I heard the words he spoke, and with some\r\ndeeper sense I translated them, though they were not uttered in any\r\nlanguage I knew:\r\n\r\n"Out of the stars we come, O men! and back to the stars we shall go,\r\nthat the best of your race may be transplanted there, and survive\r\nthrough means known to us, and again be populous and great. Through the\r\nimmense evil within the breasts of your kind, you have been purged and\r\nall but annihilated; but the good within your race has also been mighty,\r\nand can never be expunged; and that good has called through you\r\nsurviving few to us your guardians, that we may take you to another\r\nplanet, and replenish you there, and teach you that lore of love and\r\ntruth and beauty which the blind members of your species have neglected\r\nhere while they unfitted the earth for human habitation."\r\n\r\nSo speaking, the radiant one motioned to the people, who arose, and\r\nfollowed him inside the great sphere of light; and when they had all\r\nentered, it slowly began to ascend, and slowly dwindled and disappeared\r\nagainst the morning skies. And now, I knew, there was no longer a man\r\nleft anywhere on earth; yet as I gazed at the deserted shore, the empty\r\nbeach and the bare mountainside, a sense of supreme satisfaction came\r\nover me, as though I knew that in the end, after fire and agony and\r\ndegradation, all was eternally well.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat sense of supreme satisfaction remained with me when, after still\r\nanother blank interval, I opened my eyes as from a deep slumber, and\r\nstared at the familiar book-rack, the bureau, the mottled paper walls of\r\nmy own room. The clock on the little table at my side indicated the hour\r\nof 10:09--in other words, all that had happened had occupied the space\r\nof one minute! Yet I know as surely as I know that I write these\r\nwords--that the Release Drug had freed my spirit to range over thousands\r\nof miles of space, and that I have looked on people and events which no\r\nother eye will view for scores, hundreds or even thousands of years to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Fantasy Book_ Vol. 1 number 1 (1947).\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.
