De Vet_\r\n\r\n\r\n     Doctors had given him just one month to\r\n live. A month to wonder, what comes afterward?\r\n There was one way to find out--ask a dead man!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe amber brown of the liquor disguised the poison it held, and I\r\nwatched with a smile on my lips as he drank it. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
There was no pity in my\r\nheart for him. He was a jackal in the jungle of life, and I ... I was\r\none of the carnivores. It is the lot of the jackals of life to be\r\ndevoured by the carnivore.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the contented look on his face froze into a startled stillness.\r\nI knew he was feeling the first savage twinge of the agony that was to\r\ncome. He turned his head and looked at me, and I saw suddenly that he\r\nknew what I had done.\r\n\r\n"You murderer!" he cursed me, and then his body arched in the middle and\r\nhis voice choked off deep in his throat.\r\n\r\nFor a short minute he sat, tense, his body stiffened by the agony that\r\nrode it--unable to move a muscle. I watched the torment in his eyes\r\nbuild up to a crescendo of pain, until the suffering became so great\r\nthat it filmed his eyes, and I knew that, though he still stared\r\ndirectly at me, he no longer saw me.\r\n\r\nThen, as suddenly as the spasm had come, the starch went out of his body\r\nand his back slid slowly down the chair edge. He landed heavily with his\r\nhead resting limply against the seat of the chair. His right leg doubled\r\nup in a kind of jerk, before he was still.\r\n\r\nI knew the time had come.

"Where are you?" I asked.\r\n\r\nThis moment had cost me sixty thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nThree weeks ago the best doctors in the state had given me a month to\r\nlive. And with seven million dollars in the bank I couldn\'t buy a minute\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nI accepted the doctors\' decision philosophically, like the gambler\r\nthat I am. But I had a plan: One which necessity had never forced me to\r\nuse until now. Several years before I had read an article about the\r\nmedicine men of a certain tribe of aborigines living in the jungles at\r\nthe source of the Amazon River. They had discovered a process in which\r\nthe juice of a certain bush--known only to them--could be used to poison\r\na man. Anyone subjected to this poison died, but for a few minutes after\r\nthe life left his body the medicine men could still converse with him.\r\nThe subject, though ostensibly and actually dead, answered the medicine\r\nmen\'s every question. This was their primitive, though reportedly\r\neffective method of catching glimpses of what lay in the world of death.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI had conceived my idea at the time I read the article, but I had never\r\nhad the need to use it--until the doctors gave me a month to live. Then\r\nI spent my sixty thousand dollars, and three weeks later I held in my\r\nhands a small bottle of the witch doctors\' fluid.\r\n\r\nThe next step was to secure my victim--my collaborator, I preferred to\r\ncall him.\r\n\r\nThe man I chose was a nobody. A homeless, friendless non-entity, picked\r\nup off the street.

He had once been an educated man. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
But now he was only\r\na bum, and when he died he\'d never be missed. A perfect man for my\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nI\'m a rich man because I have a system. The system is simple: I never\r\nmake a move until I know exactly where that move will lead me. My field\r\nof operations is the stock market. I spend money unstintingly to secure\r\nthe information I need before I take each step. I hire the best\r\ninvestigators, bribe employees and persons in position to give me the\r\ninformation I want, and only when I am as certain as humanly possible\r\nthat I cannot be wrong do I move. And the system never fails. Seven\r\nmillion dollars in the bank is proof of that.\r\n\r\nNow, knowing that I could not live, I intended to make the system work\r\nfor me one last time before I died. I\'m a firm believer in the adage\r\nthat any situation can be whipped, given prior knowledge of its\r\ncoming--and, of course, its attendant circumstances.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor a moment he did not answer and I began to fear that my experiment\r\nhad failed. "Where are you?" I repeated, louder and sharper this time.\r\n\r\nThe small muscles about his eyes puckered with an unnormal tension\r\nwhile the rest of his face held its death frost. Slowly, slowly,\r\nunnaturally--as though energized by some hyper-rational power--his lips\r\nand tongue moved. The words he spoke were clear. "I am in a ... a ...\r\ntunnel," he said. "It is lighted, dimly, but there is nothing for me to\r\nsee." Blue veins showed through the flesh of his cheeks like watermarks\r\non translucent paper.\r\n\r\nHe paused and I urged, "Go on."\r\n\r\n"I am alone," he said. "The realities I knew no longer exist, and I am\r\ndamp and cold. All about me is a sense of gloom and dejection. It is an\r\napprehension--an emanation--so deep and real as to be almost a tangible\r\nthing. The walls to either side of me seem to be formed, not of\r\nsubstance, but rather of the soundless cries of melancholy of spirits I\r\ncannot see.\r\n\r\n"I am waiting, waiting in the gloom for something which will come to me.\r\nThat need to wait is an innate part of my being and I have no thought of\r\nquestioning it." His voice died again.\r\n\r\n"What are you waiting for?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"I do not know," he said, his voice dreary with the despair of centuries\r\nof hopelessness. "I only know that I must wait--that compulsion is\r\ngreater than my strength to combat."\r\n\r\nThe tone of his voice changed slightly. "The tunnel about me is widening\r\nand now the walls have receded into invisibility. The tunnel has become\r\na plain, but the plain is as desolate, as forlorn and dreary as was the\r\ntunnel, and still I stand and wait. How long must this go on?"\r\n\r\nHe fell silent again, and I was about to prompt him with another\r\nquestion--I could not afford to let the time run out in long\r\nsilences--but abruptly the muscles about his eyes tightened and subtly a\r\nnew aspect replaced their hopeless dejection. Now they expressed a\r\nblack, bottomless terror. For a moment I marveled that so small a\r\nportion of a facial anatomy could express such horror.\r\n\r\n"There is something coming toward me," he said. "A--beast--of brutish\r\nfoulness! Beast is too inadequate a term to describe it, but I know no\r\nwords to tell its form. It is an intangible and evasive--thing--but very\r\nreal. And it is coming closer! It has no organs of sight as I know them,\r\nbut I feel that it can see me. Or rather that it is aware of me with a\r\nsense sharper than vision itself. It is very near now. Oh God, the\r\nmalevolence, the hate--the potentiality of awful, fearsome\r\ndestructiveness that is its very essence! And still I cannot move!"\r\n\r\nThe expression of terrified anticipation, centered in his eyes, lessened\r\nslightly, and was replaced, instantly, by its former deep, deep despair.\r\n"I am no longer afraid," he said.\r\n\r\n"Why?" I interjected. "Why?" I was impatient to learn all that I could\r\nbefore the end came.\r\n\r\n"Because ..." He paused. "Because it holds no threat for me. Somehow,\r\nsomeday, I understand--I know--that it too is seeking that for which I\r\nwait."\r\n\r\n"What is it doing now?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"It has stopped beside me and we stand together, gazing across the\r\nstark, empty plain. Now a second awful entity, with the same leashed\r\nvirulence about it, moves up and stands at my other side. We all three\r\nwait, myself with a dark fear of this dismal universe, my unnatural\r\ncompanions with patient, malicious menace.\r\n\r\n"Bits of ..." He faltered. "Of ... I can name it only _aura_, go out\r\nfrom the beasts like an acid stream, and touch me, and the hate, and the\r\nvenom chill my body like a wave of intense cold.\r\n\r\n"Now there are others of the awful breed behind me. We stand, waiting,\r\nwaiting for that which will come.

What it is I do not know."\r\n\r\nI could see the pallor of death creeping steadily into the last corners\r\nof his lips, and I knew that the end was not far away. Suddenly a black\r\nfrustration built up within me. "What are you waiting for?" I screamed,\r\nthe tenseness, and the importance of this moment forcing me to lose the\r\niron self-control upon which I have always prided myself. I knew that\r\nthe answer held the secret of what I must know. If I could learn that,\r\nmy experiment would not be in vain, and I could make whatever\r\npreparations were necessary for my own death. I had to know that answer.\r\n\r\n"Think! Think!" I pleaded. "What are you waiting for?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know!" The dreary despair in his eyes, sightless as they met\r\nmine, chilled me with a coldness that I felt in the marrow of my being.\r\n"I do not know," he repeated. "I ... Yes, I do know!"\r\n\r\nAbruptly the plasmatic film cleared from his eyes and I knew that for\r\nthe first time, since the poison struck, he was seeing me, clearly. I\r\nsensed that this was the last moment before he left--for good. It had to\r\nbe now!\r\n\r\n"Tell me. I command you," I cried. "What are you waiting for?"\r\n\r\nHis voice was quiet as he murmured, softly, implacably, before he was\r\ngone.\r\n\r\n"We are waiting," he said, "for _you_."\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Imagination Stories of Science and\r\n    Fantasy_ August 1953.
