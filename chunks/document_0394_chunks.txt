For someone should claim--\r\n\r\n                        Mr. Chipfellow\'s Jackpot\r\n\r\n                                  _by\r\n                             Dick Purcell_\r\n\r\n\r\n"I\'m getting old," Sam Chipfellow said, "and old men die."\r\n\r\nHis words were an indirect answer to a question from Carter Hagen, his\r\nattorney. The two men were standing in an open glade, some distance from\r\nSam Chipfellow\'s mansion at Chipfellow\'s Folly, this being the name Sam\r\nhimself had attached to his huge estate.\r\n\r\nSam lived there quite alone except for visits from relatives and those\r\nwho claimed to be relatives. He needed no servants nor help of any kind\r\nbecause the mansion was completely automatic. Sam did not live alone\r\nfrom choice, but he was highly perceptive and it made him uncomfortable\r\nto have relatives around with but one thought in their minds: _When are\r\nyou going to die and leave me some money?_\r\n\r\nOf course, the relatives could hardly be blamed for entertaining this\r\nthought. It came as naturally as breathing because Sam Chipfellow was\r\none of those rare individuals--a scientist who had made money; all kinds\r\nof money; more money than almost anybody. And after all, his relatives\r\nwere no different than those of any other rich man. They felt they had\r\nrights.\r\n\r\nSam was known as The Genius of the Space Age, an apt title because there\r\nmight not have been any space without him. He had been extremely\r\nversatile during his long career, having been responsible for the\r\nso-called eternal metals--metal against which no temperature, corrosive,\r\nor combinations of corrosives would prevail. He was also the pioneer of\r\ntelepower, the science of control over things mechanical through the\r\nelectronic emanations of thought waves. Because of his investigations\r\ninto this power, men were able to direct great ships by merely\r\n"thinking" them on their proper courses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThese were only two of his contributions to progress, there being many\r\nothers. And now, Sam was facing the mystery neither he nor any other\r\nscientist had ever been able to solve.\r\n\r\nMortality.\r\n\r\nThere was a great deal of activity near the point at which the men\r\nstood. Drills and rock cutters had formed three sides of an enclosure in\r\na ridge of solid rock, and now a giant crane was lowering thick slabs of\r\nmetal to form the walls. Nearby, waiting to be placed, lay the slab\r\nwhich would obviously become the door to whatever Sam was building. Its\r\nsurface was entirely smooth, but it bore great hinges and some sort of a\r\nlocking device was built in along one edge.\r\n\r\nCarter Hagen watched the activity and considered Sam\'s reply to his\r\nquestion. "Then this is to be a mausoleum?"\r\n\r\nSam chuckled. "Only in a sense. Not a place to house my dead bones if\r\nthat\'s what you mean."\r\n\r\nCarter Hagen, understanding this lonely old man as he did, knew further\r\nquestions would be useless. Sam was like that. If he wanted you to know\r\nsomething, he told you.\r\n\r\nSo Carter held his peace and they returned to the mansion where Sam gave\r\nhim a drink after they concluded the business he had come on.\r\n\r\nSam also gave Carter something else--an envelope. "Put that in your\r\nsafe, Carter. You\'re comparatively young. I\'m taking it for granted you\r\nwill survive me."\r\n\r\n"And this is--?"\r\n\r\n"My will. All old men should leave wills and I\'m no exception to the\r\nrule. When I\'m dead, open it and read what\'s inside."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCarter Hagen regarded the envelope with speculation. Sam smiled. "If\r\nyou\'re wondering how much I left you, Carter, I\'ll say this: You might\r\nget it all."\r\n\r\nHagen strove to appear nonchalant but his eyes widened regardless. Sam\r\nenjoyed this. He said, "Yes, you\'ll have as much chance as anyone else."\r\n\r\n"You mean as much chance as any of your relatives?"\r\n\r\n"I mean what I said--as much as anyone. I\'ve given them no more\r\nconsideration than anyone else."\r\n\r\nCarter Hagen stared, puzzled. "I\'m afraid I don\'t understand you."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t expect you to, but that will come later. I\'ll tell you this\r\nmuch, though. No one will be barred. The winner will take all, and the\r\nwinner may be anyone on this planet. My one regret is that I won\'t be\r\naround to see who gets the jackpot."\r\n\r\nCarter Hagen dutifully pocketed the will and left. He returned on other\r\nbusiness a week later. Sam Chipfellow\'s first question was, "Well, what\r\ndid you think of it?"\r\n\r\n"Think of what?"\r\n\r\n"My will."\r\n\r\nCarter Hagen straightened to an indignant five-foot-six. "Mr.\r\nChipfellow, I don\'t like having my integrity questioned. Your will was\r\nin a sealed envelope. You instructed me to read it after your death. If\r\nyou think I\'m the sort of man who would violate a trust--"\r\n\r\nSam put a drink into his attorney\'s hand. "Here, take this. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
Calm down."\r\n\r\nCarter Hagen gulped the drink and allowed his feathers to smooth down.\r\nAs he set down his glass, Sam leaned back and said, "Now that that\'s\r\nover, let\'s get on with it. Tell me--what did you think of my will?"\r\n\r\nThe attorney flushed. It was no use trying to fool Chipfellow. He was a\r\nmaster at that damned thought business. "I--I did look at it. I couldn\'t\r\nresist the temptation. The envelope was so easily opened."\r\n\r\nSam was regarding him keenly but without anger. "I know you\'re a crook,\r\nHagen, but no more so than most people. So don\'t sit there cringing."\r\n\r\n"This will is--well, amazing, and getting an advance look didn\'t help me\r\na bit unless--" Hagen looked up hopefully. "--unless you\'re willing to\r\ngive me a slight clue--"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll give you nothing. You take your chances along with the rest."\r\n\r\nHagen sighed. "As to the will itself, all I can say is that it\'s bound\r\nto cause a sensation."\r\n\r\n"I think so too," Sam said, his eyes turning a trifle sad. "It\'s too bad\r\na man has to die just at the most interesting point of his life."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll live for years, Mr. Chipfellow. You\'re in fine condition."\r\n\r\n"Cut it out. You\'re itching for me to shuffle off so you can get a crack\r\nat what I\'m leaving behind."\r\n\r\n"Why, Mr.--"\r\n\r\n"Shut up and have another drink."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCarter Hagen did not have long to wait as life-times go. Eighteen months\r\nlater, Sam Chipfellow dropped dead while walking in his garden. The news\r\nwas broadcast immediately but the stir it caused was nothing to the\r\nworldwide reaction that came a few days later.\r\n\r\nThis was after all the relatives, all those who thought they had a faint\r\nchance of proving themselves relatives, and representatives of the\r\npress, radio, and video, gathered in the late Sam Chipfellow\'s mansion\r\nto hear the reading of the will. Carter Hagen, seeking to control his\r\nexcitement, stood before a microphone installed for the benefit of those\r\nwho couldn\'t get in.\r\n\r\nHe said, "This is the last will and testament of Samuel Chipfellow,\r\ndeceased. As his lawyer, it becomes my duty to--"\r\n\r\nAn angry murmur went up from those assembled. Exclamations of\r\nimpatience. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
"Come on! 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Get on with it. Quit making a speech and read the\r\nwill, we can\'t wait all day!"\r\n\r\n"Quiet, please, and give me your closest attention. I will read slowly\r\nso all may hear. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
This is Mr. Chipfellow\'s last testament:\r\n\r\n"_I, Samuel B. Chipfellow, have made a great deal of money during my\r\nactive years. The time now comes when I must decide what will become of\r\nit after my death. I have made my decision, but I remain in the peculiar\r\nposition of still not knowing what will become of it. Frankly, I\'m of\r\nthe opinion that no one will ever benefit from it--that it will remain\r\nin the place I have secreted it until the end of time._"\r\n\r\nA murmur went up from the crowd.\r\n\r\n"A treasure hunt!" someone cried. "I wonder if they\'ll distribute maps!"\r\n\r\nCarter Hagen raised his hand. "Please! 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Let\'s have a little more order or\r\nthe reading will not continue."\r\n\r\nThe room quieted and Hagen\'s droning voice was again raised:\r\n\r\n"_This place consists of a vault I have had erected upon my grounds.\r\nThis vault, I assure you, is burglar-proof, weather-proof,\r\ncyclone-proof, tornado-proof, bomb-proof. Time will have no effect upon\r\nits walls. It could conceivably be thrown free in some great volcanic\r\nupheaval but even then the contents would remain inaccessible._\r\n\r\n"_There is only one way the vault can be opened. Its lock is sensitized\r\nto respond to a thought. That\'s what I said--a thought. I have selected\r\na single, definite, clear-cut thought to which the combination will\r\nrespond._\r\n\r\n"_There is a stone bench in front of the vault door and I decree that\r\nany person who wishes, may sit down on this bench and direct his or her\r\nthought at the door. If it is the correct one, the door will open and\r\nthe person causing this to happen shall then be the possessor of all my\r\nworldly wealth which lies inside._\r\n\r\n"_Because of the number of persons who will no doubt wish to try their\r\nluck, I decree further that each shall be given thirty seconds in which\r\nto project their thought. A force of six men shall be hired to supervise\r\nthe operation and handle the crowds in the neighborhood of the vault. A\r\ntrust fund has been already set up to pay this group. The balance of my\r\nwealth lies awaiting the lucky thinker in the vault--all save this\r\nestate itself, an item of trifling value in comparison to the rest,\r\nwhich I bequeath to the State with the stipulation that the other terms\r\nof the will are rigidly carried out._\r\n\r\n"_And so, good luck to everyone in the world. May one of you succeed in\r\nopening my vault--although I doubt it. Samuel B. Chipfellow. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
P.S. The\r\nthought-throwing shall begin one week after the reading of the will. I\r\nadd this as a precaution to keep everyone from rushing to the vault\r\nafter this will is read. You might kill each other in the stampede. S.\r\nB. C._"\r\n\r\nThere was a rush regardless. Reporters knocked each other down getting\r\nto the battery of phones set up to carry the news around the world. And\r\nSam Chipfellow\'s will pushed all else off the video screens and the\r\nfront pages.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the following weeks, millions were made through the sale of\r\nChipfellow\'s thought to the gullible. Great commercial activity began in\r\nthe area surrounding the estate as arrangements were made to accommodate\r\nthe hundreds of thousands who were heading in that direction.\r\n\r\nA line began forming immediately at the gate to Chipfellow\'s Folly and a\r\nbrisk market got under way in positions therein. The going figure of the\r\nfirst hundred positions was in the neighborhood of ten thousand dollars.\r\nA man three thousand thoughts away was offered a thousand dollars two\r\ndays before the week was up, and on the last day, the woman at the head\r\nof the line sold her position for eighteen thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nThere were many learned roundtables and discussions as to the nature of\r\nChipfellow\'s thought. The majority leaned to the belief that it would be\r\nscientific in nature because Chipfellow was the world\'s greatest\r\nscientist.\r\n\r\nThis appeared to give scientifically trained brains the edge and those\r\nfortunate in this respect spent long hours learning what they could of\r\nChipfellow\'s life, trying to divine his performance in the realm of\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nSo intense was the interest created that scarcely anyone paid attention\r\nto the activities of Chipfellow\'s closer relatives. They sued to break\r\nthe will but met with defeat. The verdict was rendered speedily, after\r\nwhich the judge who made the ruling declared a recess and bought the\r\neleven thousandth position in line for five hundred dollars.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the appointed day, the gates were opened and the line\r\nmoved toward the vault. The first man took his seat on the bench. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
A\r\nstopwatch clicked. A great silence settled over the watchers. This\r\nlasted for thirty seconds after which the watch clicked again. The man\r\ngot up from the bench eighteen thousand dollars poorer.\r\n\r\nThe vault had not opened.\r\n\r\nNor did it open the next day, the next, nor the next. A week passed, a\r\nmonth, six months. And at the end of that time it was estimated that\r\nmore than twenty-five thousand people had tried their luck and failed.\r\n\r\nEach failure was greeted with a public sigh of relief--relief from both\r\nthose who were waiting for a turn and those who were getting rich from\r\nthe commercial enterprises abutting upon the Chipfellow estate.\r\n\r\nThere was a motel, a hotel, a few night clubs, a lot of restaurants, a\r\nhastily constructed bus terminal, an airport and several turned into\r\nparking lots at a dollar a head.\r\n\r\nThe line was a permanent thing and it was soon necessary to build a\r\ncement walk because the ever-present hopeful were standing in a ditch a\r\nfoot deep.\r\n\r\nThere also continued to be an active business in positions, a group of\r\nprofessional standers having sprung up, each with an assistant to bring\r\nfood and coffee and keep track of the ever fluctuating market in\r\npositions.\r\n\r\nAnd still no one opened Chipfellow\'s vault.\r\n\r\nIt was conceded that the big endowment funds had the inside track\r\nbecause they had the money to hire the best brains in the world; men who\r\nwere almost as able scientifically as had been Chipfellow himself but\r\nunfortunately hadn\'t made as much money. The monied interests also had\r\naccess to the robot calculators that turned out far more plausible\r\nthoughts than there were positions in the line.\r\n\r\nA year passed. The vault remained locked.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy that time the number of those who had tried and failed, and were\r\nnaturally disgruntled, was large enough to be heard, so a rumor got\r\nabout that the whole thing was a vast hoax--a mean joke perpetrated upon\r\nthe helpless public by a lousy old crook who hadn\'t any money in the\r\nfirst place.\r\n\r\nVituperative editorials were written--by editors who had stood in line\r\nand thrown futile thoughts at the great door. These editorials were\r\nvigorously rebutted by editors and columnists who as yet had not had a\r\nchance to try for the jackpot.\r\n\r\nOne senator, who had tried and missed, introduced a law making it\r\nillegal to sit on a stone bench and hurl a thought at a door.\r\n\r\nThere were enough congressional failures to pass the law. It went to the\r\nSupreme Court, but was tossed out because they said you couldn\'t pass a\r\nlaw prohibiting a man from thinking.\r\n\r\nAnd still the vault remained closed.\r\n\r\nUntil Mr. and Mrs. Wilson, farm people impoverished by reverses, spent\r\ntheir last ten dollars for two thoughts and waited out the hours and the\r\ndays in line. Their daughter Susan, aged nine, waited with them,\r\npassing the time by telling her doll fairy tales and wondering what the\r\nworld looked like to a bird flying high up over a tree top. Susan was\r\nglad when her mother and father reached the bench because then they all\r\ncould go home and see how her pet rabbit was doing.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson hurled his thought and moved on with drooping shoulders. Mrs.\r\nWilson threw hers and was told to leave the bench. The guard looked at\r\nSusan. "Your turn," he said.\r\n\r\n"But I haven\'t got any thought," Susan said. "I just want to go home."\r\n\r\nThis made no sense to the guard. The line was being held up. People were\r\ngrumbling. The guard said, "All right, but that was silly. You could\r\nhave sold your position for good money. Run along with your mother and\r\nfather.

=== Chunk 9 ===
"\r\n\r\nSusan started away. Then she looked at the vault which certainly\r\nresembled a mausoleum and said, "Wait--I have too got a little thought,"\r\nand she popped onto the bench.\r\n\r\nThe guard frowned and snapped his stop watch.\r\n\r\nSusan screwed her eyes tight shut. She tried to see an angel with big\r\nwhite wings like she sometimes saw in her dreams and she also tried to\r\nvisualize a white-haired, jolly-faced little man as she considered Mr.\r\nChipfellow to be. Her lips moved soundlessly as she said,\r\n\r\n_Dear God and all the angels--please have pity on poor Mr. Chipfellow\r\nfor dying and please make him happy in heaven._\r\n\r\nThen Susan got off the bench quickly to run after her mother and father\r\nwho had not waited.\r\n\r\nThere was the sound of metal grinding upon metal and the great door was\r\nswinging open.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Imagination_ April 1956.
