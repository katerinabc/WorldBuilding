]\r\n\r\n\r\nSeptember, 1931.\r\n\r\nThe lights of Europe still burned.\r\n\r\nThe black hulk of Ploving Manor was broken by the squares of brilliant,\r\nfriendly light from its many windows that gave the old country seat\r\nalmost a cheerful aspect. From the stone terrace to the south of\r\nProfessor Ploving\'s study long strings of bobbing, soft-glowing\r\nlanterns stretched across the close-cropped lawn to the dark outline of\r\nthe orchard. Beyond the orchard was the pounding beat of the Channel.\r\n\r\nOn a platform under the lights young men and young women danced to the\r\nstrange new throbbing music from the Americas. It was a pulsing tom-tom\r\nbeat, that music, that called for a measure of gay abandon and a great\r\ndeal of muscular dexterity. But not quite the same sort of abandon\r\nthat their mothers and father had known. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
For those lovely women at the\r\nterrace tables and the gray-templed men at their sides had been the\r\nfabulous, almost forgotten "lost generation" of an almost forgotten\r\n"post-war" period. These youngsters dancing under the English stars\r\nand pressing hands in the orchard\'s shadow were the fortunate chosen\r\nones who would build at last the brave new world that had been their\r\nfathers\' dream.\r\n\r\nStephen Darville stood in the shadows of a great clump of rhododendrons\r\nat the terrace edge watching the swirl of color on the lawn, his eyes\r\nsearching the laughing crowd for a sight of Jean. His eyes found her\r\nand followed her across the lawn. When she came near he called her name.\r\n\r\nShe hurried to him and took his hands in a friendly tug.\r\n\r\n"One dance together, Steve, before you go out to the workshop."\r\n\r\nHe shook his head.\r\n\r\n"Just one," she pleaded.\r\n\r\nHe pressed her hands, watching the way the stiff sea breeze ruffled the\r\ngay silk kerchief at her throat.\r\n\r\n"There\'s no time. Your father\'s waiting for me now."\r\n\r\n"Confound father, confound you and confound science."\r\n\r\nShe laughed, but there had been a note of real annoyance in her voice.\r\n\r\nDarville looked at the soft curve of her throat and the high-lighted\r\nsheen of her close-cropped brown hair and beyond the moving figures on\r\nthe lawn. He suddenly wanted it all; the music and the laughter and the\r\ngaiety and the feel of her in his arms. But he wanted the other, too;\r\nthe thing that awaited him out there in John Ploving\'s workshop. The\r\nfeel of metal cold in his hands, metal that his own hands had helped to\r\nshape, and the crazy swaying of the thin needles on the control board\r\nbefore him. The age-old call of the twin, conflicting fires in the\r\nblood of youth--Duty and Romance.\r\n\r\nShe, too, was looking out toward the dancing couples. He took her\r\nimpulsively in his arms and for a moment she clung to him.\r\n\r\n"You can come back to me later on this evening when you and father are\r\nthrough," she whispered.\r\n\r\nHe wanted to crush her to him, wanted to whisper "If I do come back,\r\nif there is a \'later on this evening\' for me." But he only pressed her\r\nfingers lightly.\r\n\r\n"Save me a dance," he said, and hurried away down the narrow path to\r\nProfessor Ploving\'s shop.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe things that Professor Ploving and his young assistant did there in\r\nthe shop were known only to themselves; even those in the immediate\r\nfamily had long ago learned to ask no questions and, above all, never\r\nto "snoop." Ploving was no more immune than others to longings for\r\nfame, but years of observing with his keen, analytical mind the affairs\r\nof men both in and out of laboratories, had taught him caution. A\r\nprofessor of the august University of London, even a professor of\r\nindependent wealth and impeccable family, could hardly dare lay\r\nhimself open to ridicule.\r\n\r\nHad he been seeking to release atomic energy he could have spoken\r\nglibly and weightily of corpuscular radiations and electrodes and\r\natom-smashing and even the news-reporters would have managed to splash\r\nhim upon the Sunday feature pages as a brainy and adventurous fellow\r\nand a chap to know. But let him once point to his much discussed\r\nmathematical equations on his theory of the time-curve and suggest\r\nthat he intended to utilize his theory in a most practical way and the\r\nworld, he knew, would shout "time machine" and "crack-pot." For time\r\nmachines, in 1931, were things to be left to H. G. Wells and to the\r\nrising crop of talented and imaginative English and American fantasy\r\nwriters. It was no doings for a man of action and, above all, for a man\r\nof science.\r\n\r\nSteve Darville closed the workshop door behind him, muting the tom-tom\r\nrhythms of the music from the terrace lawn.\r\n\r\nThe Ploving Tube stood with its small door, not unlike the door of a\r\nChannel transport plane, swinging open. The professor was beside it,\r\nwiping his glasses on a linen kerchief, trying to hide the nervousness\r\nthat made the knotty blue veins of his hands jerk spasmodically. He\r\nhad thrown open the small window at the south wall and through it\r\nSteve caught a glimpse of the rooftops of the newly-built Ploving\r\nLaboratories which lay just under the hill, almost beside the Channel.\r\nThe laboratories that were to mean so much--or nothing.\r\n\r\nIntricate calculations, founded upon his own theories of the\r\n"time-curve," had been utilized by Professor Ploving in creation of the\r\nPloving Tube, a cylinder most undramatic in appearance. But the heart\r\nof the tube was the tiny Ploving Button, a small incased mechanism no\r\nmore than an inch in thickness and a couple of inches in diameter. If\r\nthe tube were to be a success, it must depend upon that one tiny button.\r\n\r\nThe button in the present tube was the result of nearly ten years of\r\nintensive labor. If it failed, another five to ten years would be\r\nneeded to duplicate the experiment. According to his figures, Ploving\r\nfelt the button capable of sending the tube no more than ten years into\r\nthe future and return.\r\n\r\nThe professor\'s plan, based upon that single assumption, was unique.\r\n\r\nAlready the first wing of the new Ploving Laboratories was complete.\r\nThere, in the building that would absorb nearly his entire fortune, the\r\ncarefully assembled corps of young experimenters would work night and\r\nday to perfect the Ploving Button, although they could only guess at\r\nits ultimate purpose. Within ten years, if things went well, Ploving\r\nfelt that a button should have been developed capable of opening the\r\nentire time-curve to the adventurous exploration of mankind.\r\n\r\n"But I\'m an old man," the professor had snorted in the confidence of\r\nthe little workshop. "I\'ve no time to be dawdling about for a decade\r\nwaiting for something to happen."\r\n\r\nThe Ploving plan was as simple as it was astounding. He meant to use\r\nthat single button already created to go ten years into the future,\r\ntake the finished products of his laboratories--the Ploving Button of\r\nten years hence--return with them to his own time and proudly present\r\nthem to their creators, the technicians who were so far only fumbling\r\nwith the problem of their perfection.\r\n\r\nThe technicians would "save" themselves ten years of labor and the new\r\nsweeping highway into the future and the past would be open to mankind\r\nwithin the life of its discoverer.\r\n\r\nOnly cold, inexorable logic kept the old man from insisting that he\r\nshould be at the controls when the Ploving Tube met its first test.\r\nBut logic was a god to whom the professor could always bow gracefully,\r\nif grudgingly, and logic certainly dictated the need for youthful\r\nco-ordination and strength during those fateful moments that could\r\nadvance the scope of man\'s knowledge by a decade.\r\n\r\nPloving had conveyed his decision to his younger colleague only the day\r\nbefore in his characteristic way.\r\n\r\n"You\'re elected, young man, by a unanimous vote of two."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSteve Darville, gazing past Professor Ploving to the moonlit scene\r\nbeyond the window, wondered what changes ten years would have wrought.\r\nThere could be little alteration in the immediate vicinity of the\r\nworkshop, he knew, for the cautious professor had taken no chances. His\r\niron law had decreed that nothing be erected or remodeled or torn away\r\nin the vicinity of the workshop; the provision, as an added precaution,\r\nbeing incorporated as the first item in his will.\r\n\r\nThe professor fumbled with his spectacles, managed at last to place\r\nthem upon his nose at an unaccustomed angle, and coughed hesitatingly.\r\n\r\n"Ready?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Ready," Darville told him, and turned to the tube.\r\n\r\nIt was a moment made for drama, but there was no time for drama.\r\nHe climbed into the narrow tube, strapped himself into the awkward\r\njump-seat and carefully checked the dial readings on the control panel\r\nbefore him. He nodded without glancing out toward the professor, jerked\r\nhis hand in a quick salute and closed the tube\'s door.\r\n\r\nFor a single moment he thought of the music and laughter out on the\r\nlawn beyond, the laughter and music he was missing tonight as he had\r\nbeen missing them for so many nights on end. But in the moment that he\r\neased the control stick toward him he knew that it had been a small\r\nprice for this moment. One hour more, less than an hour, and there\r\nwould be time again for music and laughter and cool arms--or no longer\r\nneed of them.\r\n\r\nThe thin needles vibrated to life, swayed crazily across the faces of\r\ncompact dials and as suddenly hesitated and stopped. To the man within\r\nthe tube it seemed impossible that anything could have happened in\r\nthose seconds. It was ludicrous; a moment more, he knew, and he must\r\nstep out to face the heartbreak in the eyes of the kindly old man\r\nwaiting just outside those thin metal walls.\r\n\r\nTo open that door required a kind of courage Darville had never needed\r\nbefore and for seconds he hesitated, prolonging the moment. What could\r\nhe say to the broken man at the other side of that door, what would\r\nthere be to say? His white-knuckled fist twisted the latch, threw the\r\ndoor open almost rudely.\r\n\r\nThe workshop was dark, save for soft moonlight that flooded across a\r\nsection of the floor from a gaping hole in the roof and farther wall.\r\nRubble lay in heaps over the shop; broken plaster and crumbled bricks\r\nand twisted, jagged fingers of steel.\r\n\r\nHe had to pick his way among them as he sought the old familiar path\r\nbeyond that gaping splotch of moonlight.\r\n\r\nThe path, too, was strewn with rubble and beyond the path a black,\r\npitted hole yawned among the broken, uprooted trees that had been\r\nthe orchard--was it only a few minutes ago? Darville rubbed a hand\r\nacross his face, pulling roughly at his cheeks with thumb and fingers.\r\nInstinctively he wheeled toward the booming reverberation of the\r\nChannel, toward the costly Ploving Laboratories that were his goal.\r\n\r\nHe felt suddenly sick and tired and old.\r\n\r\nThey, too, were gone; a single tall chimney, like a blackened finger\r\nagainst the moon-swept sky, was all that marked the site of the first\r\ngreat sprawling wing that had been the crux of Ploving\'s dream.\r\n\r\nPloving, Jean, where were they?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBlindly, almost running, Darville stumbled up the path toward the\r\nsouth lawn, then stood weak and trembling at the edge of the twisted,\r\nfire-scorched orchard, gazing toward the bulk of Ploving Manor across\r\nthe lawn that had been, for him, only minutes ago aglow with the soft\r\nlight of swinging lanterns.\r\n\r\nThe manor was in ruins; a black, blind, toothless hag squatting in\r\nsullen anger against the rolling meadow--windowless, fire-charred,\r\nforlorn. As though his body moved to some other will than his own,\r\nDarville walked slowly across that barren lawn toward the house.\r\n\r\nHe was almost within one of the gaping doorways, the doorway to old\r\nPloving\'s study, before his keen eyes caught the faint glimmer of\r\nyellow light from a single crack at the foot of the cellar stairs.\r\nLight meant human beings who could tell him the things he dreaded to\r\nhear yet must know. Running down the steps he tried the door and,\r\nfinding it locked, beat upon it with his fists.\r\n\r\nThe crack of light suddenly expanded and through the partially opened\r\ndoorway Darville saw the ugly snout of an automatic trained at his\r\nribs. His eyes followed the uniformed arm upward to the insignia on the\r\nshoulder and to the stiff, tired face of the young officer who eyed him\r\nquestioningly. The automatic waved him inside and the door was shut\r\nquickly behind him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWithin the smoke-filled room several men, all in uniform, sat about a\r\ntable. Together they turned to stare at the newcomer. But it was the\r\nface of the lanky major with the shrapnel scar jagged across a cheek,\r\nthat held Stephen Darville riveted. The major\'s lips were opened, as if\r\nto speak, and his eyes dilated strangely.\r\n\r\nDarville watched the man shake his head to clear away the sudden\r\nparalysis; saw his eyes soften.\r\n\r\n"Sorry," the major said, rising. "Terribly sorry. But fact is, you\r\nlook remarkably like a chap I soldiered with in Flanders. Died the\r\nlast night of Dunkirk. Blown to bits. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Shame, too. A brilliant fellow.\r\nScientist of promise, I believe, before the war. You\'re a good ten\r\nyears or so younger of course, but the resemblance is uncanny."\r\n\r\nThe lanky major hesitated awkwardly.\r\n\r\n"I say, you couldn\'t be--But no, I remember he was an only child."\r\n\r\nThe tension had broken. A stubby fellow in captain\'s uniform turned to\r\nhis superior officer.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean Darville, do you? Steve Darville?"\r\n\r\nThe major nodded.\r\n\r\n"Funny," the captain said. "I never met Darville, you know. But last\r\nfortnight I bumped into his wife. Ploving her name was. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Plucky. Air\r\nwarden in the Dover area. Caught hell there. Lost an arm eight months\r\nago, but do you know, she wouldn\'t quit. Not her. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Back on duty and one\r\nof the best they\'ve got."\r\n\r\nSteve Darville stumbled blindly to the door and up the steps. Out on\r\nthe path he did not turn to look back at the shell of the manor, black\r\nand gaunt and desolate against the sky.\r\n\r\nHis hands shook as he reset the dial readings and pulled the control.\r\nHe saw the needles sway and dance. He was hardly aware of it when they\r\nceased swaying. Numbly he reached for the door latch.\r\n\r\nInside the workshop was the bright glow of bulbs. A stiff breeze blew\r\nin at the open window. Instinctively, Darville glanced at his wrist\r\nwatch. He had been away, in that future that was not his future, for\r\nless than three-quarters of an hour.\r\n\r\nProfessor Ploving\'s eyes met his, read the frustration there. The older\r\nman said nothing, but put a hand out to the smooth surface of the tube\r\nand buried his face in his arm.\r\n\r\nDarville slipped quietly out of the workshop and up the familiar path,\r\nmoonlight-flooded between the orchard trees. At the orchard\'s edge he\r\nhalted; stood listening to the gay abandon of the music and the voices,\r\nsearching that blob of light and color for Jean. She was standing at\r\nthe edge of the lawn, a little apart from the others.\r\n\r\nStephen Darville went to her quickly, smothered her cry of pleased\r\nsurprise with a quick kiss and led her to the jerry-built dance floor.\r\nTogether they caught the tom-tom rhythm, moved into the circling stream\r\nof the dancers.\r\n\r\n"Steve," she said, her voice eager, "do you have to go back tonight?"\r\n\r\n"Not tonight or ever," he said.\r\n\r\n"Steve!"\r\n\r\n"From now on, young one, I have time only for you."\r\n\r\n"Steve," she cried. Her arm pressed him, her hand squeezed his. "We\'ll\r\nbe the happiest people in the world, Steve. The happiest, gayest,\r\nmost in love two people in the world. And we\'ll go on being that,\r\nSteve--forever."\r\n\r\nTwo trumpets were taking a hot chorus, unmuted, their notes sharp and\r\nhigh and quivering.\r\n\r\n"Forever," he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s Forever is Not So Long, by F.
