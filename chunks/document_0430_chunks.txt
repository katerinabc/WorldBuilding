CLAIR\r\n\r\n                Like all her other plants from far-off\r\n              worlds, Aunt Amy hoped the Venusian Rambler\r\n                  would win a prize. It hoped so too.\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n                      Planet Stories Summer 1950.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Bjornson shook a grizzled head. "I never saw a plant I liked\r\nthe looks of less," he said. "I don\'t know how he got it through the\r\nplanetary plant quarantine. You take my advice, Amy, and watch out for\r\nit." He took another of the little geela nut cookies from the quaint\r\nold lucite platter, and bit into it appreciatively.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dinsmore sniffed, "I don\'t know what you\'re driving at," she said\r\ncoldly, "or why you\'re so prejudiced against my poor little Rambler.\r\nYou know perfectly well that Robert would never send me anything the\r\nleast bit dangerous."\r\n\r\nCaptain Bjornson paused with another cookie half-way to his lips and\r\nlooked at her. "Wouldn\'t send you anything dangerous!" he exclaimed.\r\n"Why, Amy, have you forgotten how your face was swelled up for two\r\nweeks from that tree cutting he sent you? The doctor said it was a\r\ncontact poison worse than sumach, and he tried to get you to go to the\r\nhospital. What about the time that cactus from the Blue Desert went\r\nto seed, and I spent thirty-six hours picking spines out of you? What\r\nabout--" Mrs. Dinsmore gave a warning sniff.\r\n\r\n"Well, all right," Bjornson said. "I know how fond you are of Bob, and\r\nI know you don\'t like me to mention his mistakes. I\'ll grant you he\r\nmeans well. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
So what? He\'s flighty, scatter-brained, and brash. To use\r\nan expression that was current when I was a boy, Bob is a twerp."\r\n\r\nMrs. Dinsmore pulled the lucite platter so far over to her own side\r\nof the table that Bjornson couldn\'t get another cookie from it\r\nwithout getting up and stretching out along the table cloth. "I don\'t\r\nagree with you," she said distantly. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
"Robert is a splendid fellow,\r\nso thoughtful and considerate. He takes a real interest in my soap\r\ncarvings, and how many young men with an important position like his,\r\nthird mate on a space freighter with a regularly scheduled run, would\r\nremember to send back plants from every port of call to an aunt on\r\nearth? I shouldn\'t be surprised if I won a blue ribbon at the flower\r\nshow again this year; my Golden Rain plant is about to bloom. Robert\r\ntells me it\'s a lovely thing."\r\n\r\nThe captain cast a wistful look at the cookie plate. "Well, don\'t say I\r\ndidn\'t warn you," he replied. "When\'s Bob due in port?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Dinsmore\'s face relaxed. "Around the twenty-fifth," she said, "he\r\nsent me a \'gram. Here, have another cookie. I must think up some little\r\nthing to cook for him as a surprise."\r\n\r\nThe captain snaffled a handful of cookies from the plate and stood up\r\nto go. "Your ordinary cooking\'s good enough for me," he declared, "but,\r\nif you mean something like those little shrimps fried in batter you\r\nhad the last time he was here, go ahead. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
And watch for that plant." He\r\nstalked off across the lawn.\r\n\r\nHe\'s getting old, thought Amy Dinsmore, watching the gruff old codger\r\nlimp around a flower bed (Bjornson had had prosthetic surgery after he\r\nlost his foot and, though it had been successful, grafts were never\r\nas flexible as natural members), positively old. He ought to see a\r\ngeriatrician right away. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
She\'d tell him so the next time he came to see\r\nher. Talking about Robert that way!\r\n\r\nShe set the dial on the robot gardener on the front lawn to "Weeding:\r\ndandelions" and started along the path that led to the little hothouse\r\nwhere most of the plants Robert had sent her were growing; even in\r\nthe deep tropics Terra was, with few exceptions, too cold and dry for\r\nthem. The Martian subjects, on the other hand, were in a psychroplex\r\nlean-to, with hygro-scopes and a battery of infra-red lamps to keep the\r\ntemperature up during the day.\r\n\r\nThe heavy moist air of the hothouse made Amy Dinsmore pant a little as\r\nshe entered it--but how _interesting_ it was! Even the leaves of her\r\nVenusian plants were fascinating, thick and leatherlike, thin and dry\r\nand hard like parchment, hanging in heavy serpentine coils or bristling\r\npointed and sharp as so many spears. And their coloring ranged from\r\ncerise through a silky taupe and indigo around to an angry bright\r\nmetallic blue. As for their flowers--oh, my. Amy Dinsmore had never\r\nseen anything like them. All you could do was stand in front of them\r\nwith your mouth open and stare. When she wasn\'t looking at her Martian\r\nsucculents, they were her favorites of anything she grew.\r\n\r\nShe halted in front of the plant Robert had sent her last. Yes, Hjalmar\r\nBjornson was getting definitely senile. How could anybody think that\r\nthis poor little dried-up thing could be harmful? It was a mere bundle\r\nof desiccated stems, with only a tiny new leaf or two to indicate that\r\nit was alive. It looked a little better than it had yesterday, though;\r\nthe colchine solution must have been good for it. Amy brushed a few\r\ndead flies from the ledge behind it into her hand and threw them into\r\nthe composter. She liked to have things neat.\r\n\r\nNow, what should she cook as a surprise for Robert? He was fond of\r\nsweet things, of course, but it always seemed to her that he praised\r\nher meat dishes and entrees most. He liked her cooking so much\r\nbecause her roast turkeys and grilled steaks had a crust on them;\r\nelectronically cooked food was quick to prepare and it might be as good\r\nfor you as they said it was, but the outside looked like the inside,\r\nand it all tasted flavorless and grey. What was the use of saving time\r\nin cooking if you ended up with food that wasn\'t any fun to eat?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"You aren\'t looking well, Amy," Captain Bjornson said three or four\r\nweeks later. He looked at her with the critical attention of an old\r\nfriend. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
"You\'ve got on a lot of cosmi-lac, but you still look peaked.\r\nWhat\'s the matter, worried about Bob? Ships don\'t get hurt in meteor\r\nswarms any more." He looked down at his grafted foot reminiscently.\r\n"Not like it was when _I_ was a third mate."\r\n\r\nAmy Dinsmore shook her head. She picked up one of the brightly-colored\r\nhexagons--they had been playing a desultory game of Maroola in the airy\r\ncoolness of the side stoa--and fiddled with it.\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t been sleeping well," she confessed at last. "I\'ve had such\r\nunpleasant dreams. Horrid things."\r\n\r\n"What about?" Bjornson asked. "That blasted plant? Honestly, Amy, it\r\nlooks like some kind of spider to me."\r\n\r\n"No! I don\'t know why you can\'t leave my Venusian Rambler alone! Robert\r\ntold me it was a very valuable plant, rare even in its own habitat.\r\nIt\'s doing so nicely, too. A spider! I wish you\'d stop trying to spoil\r\nit for me."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry," Bjornson apologized. "Forget it. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Go on, tell me about your\r\ndreams."\r\n\r\n"Well, on Tuesday--or was it Wednesday?--no, it must have been Tuesday\r\nbecause that was the day after I flew over to Hartford--I was down by\r\nthe hothouse and I found the most unpleasant thing beside the path."\r\nShe shuddered. "I\'ve been dreaming about it ever since."\r\n\r\n"What was it?" Bjornson urged.\r\n\r\n"Oh, a--I guess it must have been a rabbit once. One of the wild ones.\r\nOnly it was nothing except some fur and some bones. Not decayed,\r\nHjalmar, you understand, just gone. I can\'t imagine what had happened\r\nto it."\r\n\r\n"Better see a mental hygienist," the Captain advised after a pause.\r\n"Nightmares can be very serious."\r\n\r\n"I suppose so. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
I really dread going to sleep."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next morning, very early, Amy turned on the fluor with unsteady\r\nfingers. What a horrid dream it had been! She could hardly believe that\r\nit hadn\'t been real and that she was safe and sound in her own bedroom\r\nafter all.\r\n\r\nOutside, the noise that had wakened her--the jagged, unearthly\r\ncaterwauling of a couple of tomcats promenading in the moonlight--came\r\nagain. Ordinarily it was a noise Amy disliked very much--the poor\r\nthings always sounded as if they were in deadly agony--but now she\r\nwas glad to hear it. Heavens, if it hadn\'t been for those cats crying\r\nand waking her up, she might still be asleep and dreaming. Dreaming\r\nabout--about--_blood_....\r\n\r\nShe turned the ceiling selector to "summer sky," lay back on her\r\npillow, and tried to relax. It was her favorite of all the ceilings\r\nher bedroom had, so lovely and calm and blue, and right now she needed\r\nsomething lovely and calm. One thing was sure, she wasn\'t going to\r\nstand this much longer. She didn\'t believe in pampering herself, but,\r\nif she had that dream once more she was going to take Bjornson\'s advice\r\nand see a mental hygienist.\r\n\r\nShe\'d think about something pleasant. Amy tried to fix her mind on her\r\ngardening, on how well her plants were doing, but it wasn\'t a success.\r\nWhen she tried to keep her thoughts on her Venusian Rambler (why did\r\nthey call it a Rambler?--it was turning into a large, stocky, compact\r\nbush more like an outsized Camellia than anything else Amy Dinsmore\r\ncould think of), they kept veering back to her dream and all that--all\r\nthat--\r\n\r\nWell, then she\'d think about Robert. She was a lucky woman to have\r\na nephew like him. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
She\'d worked out several menus, all the things\r\nhe liked best, but she wished she could think of something a little\r\ndifferent. There were so few kinds of meat, when everything was said\r\nand done. Lamb and beef and musk ox and bollo and pork. And she always\r\nthought bollo was stringy and tough.\r\n\r\nGradually Amy\'s nerves began to quiet. The cats had grown quiet too,\r\nexcept for an occasional outburst that sounded like lightning made\r\naudible. Her thoughts drifted lazily from Robert to her soap carving.\r\nAfter a while she went to sleep....\r\n\r\nThe morning was sunny and bright, and she felt almost ashamed of\r\nherself for having let a dream affect her so seriously. She had\r\nfinished her matutinal inspection of the hothouse and the succulent\r\ngrowing-shed and had started back to the house when she came on a\r\nbundle lying by the hothouse wall. At first she didn\'t recognize it for\r\nwhat it was, and stooped over it, poking at it with a stick.\r\n\r\nAfter an instant she straightened, nauseated, remembering where she had\r\nlast seen that ginger-colored fur. The bundle was the not very bulky\r\nremains--bones, and some patches of hide--of a cat. Hadn\'t there been\r\nsome pieces of white fur too?--of two cats.\r\n\r\nShe\'d better call Hjalmar. It might be dangerous. There must be some\r\nwild animal living near her hothouse, a lynx or ferret or wildcat or\r\nstoat. Mrs. Dinsmore wasn\'t strong on zoology, but she knew exactly\r\nwhat sort of an animal she had in mind--something lithe and dark and\r\nblood-thirsty. Goodness. It was quite frightening.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Robert would be in port in a couple of days. If\r\nshe asked Hjalmar to help her, he\'d either make an enormous masculine\r\nfuss over it (she still remembered the time she\'d asked him to put up\r\na towel rack for her and he\'d arrived with a set of socket wrenches, a\r\nhand electric drill, four pairs of pliers, and a portable arc welding\r\noutfit) or he\'d pooh-pooh and pish-tush her into silence. Either way,\r\nit wouldn\'t be satisfactory. She\'d wait for Robert; Robert was so\r\ncomforting. If only she didn\'t have more of those dreams!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDespite her apprehensions, her next night\'s slumber was profound and\r\nsweet. She hadn\'t felt so rested and refreshed in weeks. She put the\r\nsomni-spray (maybe if she\'d thought to use it before she wouldn\'t have\r\nhad those horrid nightmares) back in the closet and decided that she\'d\r\ndo some soap carving after breakfast. She felt in the mood for it, and\r\nRobert would be disappointed if she didn\'t have something new to show\r\nhim that she\'d carved since he had last been in port. Besides, she\r\nmight be able to think of the special dish she wanted to make for him\r\nwhile she was working: she\'d found from experience that some of her\r\nbest culinary ideas came to her while she was making a statuette or\r\nplaque out of soap.\r\n\r\nThe meal concluded, she got out her set of modeling knives and a couple\r\nof cakes of soap. Soap was rather hard to get, since most people used\r\nsynthetic detergents nowadays, but she knew a little store in Perth\r\nAmboy that carried it. This last batch had a lovely texture.\r\n\r\nAmy rotated the living room on its axis until the light was exactly\r\nright, and then sat down in front of her carving desk. What should she\r\nmake? A statuette? A plaque? A plaque in low relief, a plaque of a\r\nflower. Somehow, she didn\'t want to think about animals right now.\r\n\r\nShe had sketched in the conventionalized Hermodactylus and was\r\nbeginning to pick it out carefully from the background when it occurred\r\nto her that she hadn\'t been down to the hothouse this morning to see\r\nher plants.\r\n\r\nWhy, that would never do, she mustn\'t neglect them, it was terribly\r\nimportant. Important. (Her head hurt; how dizzy she felt!) She\'d better\r\ngo at once, she\'d better ... go.... Cake of soap in one hand, knife\r\nin the other, panting a little, Amy set out toward her plants in a\r\nstumbling run.\r\n\r\nShe was half-way to the hothouse before it occurred to her to question\r\nthe impulse which had taken her incontinently from her carving and\r\nset her in blind motion toward the hothouse, and by then it was too\r\nlate. She was no longer a free agent in any sense of the term. The\r\nmental grip which had taken the rabbit and the cats to their death\r\nhad tightened on her inescapably. Remote from her body, in a glassy\r\nparalysis of fear and impotence, Amy watched her feet moving briskly\r\ndown the path.\r\n\r\nOh, if she could only cry out, call Hjalmar! She felt the muscles of\r\nher throat straining, but no sound came. And now she was standing\r\nbefore the hothouse, and her hand had opened the door.\r\n\r\nThe Rambler was waiting for her. Very slowly, like a man flexing his\r\narm, it reached out one of the stocky branches toward her. Amy saw that\r\nat the end of the branch, well hidden under the dark green, glossy\r\nleaves, was a slender, translucent, hollow thorn. It was about the size\r\nof the hypodermic needle the doctor had used when, in her last year\'s\r\nphysical examination, he\'d taken a sample of blood.\r\n\r\nAmy knew exactly what was going to happen. First the hollow thorn,\r\nuntil her veins were dry, and then the slowly opening maw, gaping above\r\nthe big, swollen, meter-wide base the thick leaves of the Rambler had\r\nserved to conceal. It would take a long time, but Hjalmar would never\r\nmiss her before it was too late.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _She knew exactly what was going to happen._]\r\n\r\nThe Rambler\'s branch moved delicately over the surface of Amy\'s right\r\nwrist, the one with the modeling knife. The other branches were\r\ndrooping limply away from the purple-pink of its swollen base, waiting,\r\nwhile it hunted the exact spot. It hesitated for an instant and\r\nthen--Amy\'s mouth drew into a soundless Oh of pain--struck home.\r\n\r\nA dark fluid began to stain the hollow thorn. For just a fraction\r\nof a second the Rambler\'s mental grip on Amy Dinsmore relaxed; she\r\ncould feel its blind concentration on its own black enjoyment. And in\r\nthat fraction of a second Amy threw the cake of soap in her left hand\r\nstraight into the Rambler\'s fleshy maw.\r\n\r\nThe Rambler gripped at her mind again, but it was a disturbed and\r\nfeeble grip. Its branches began to move around the fleshy bole they\r\nhad shielded, slowly, and then in a furious heaving. The thorn which\r\nhad entered her wrist was jaggedly withdrawn. Amy, her wrist streaming\r\nblood, stared at the Rambler for a moment and then lunged at it with\r\nthe menacing knife.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSitting outside on the ground beside the hothouse afterward, her\r\nforehead on her hands, feeling sick and faint, Amy had an idea. At\r\nfirst she pushed it from her; it was far-fetched, silly, even a little\r\nrepulsive.\r\n\r\nBut was it so silly after all? And as to being unpleasant, well, bollo\r\nmeat commanded enormous prices in the market and, from everything she\'d\r\never heard, the bollo was the very reverse of a fastidious feeder. Even\r\npigs certainly weren\'t dainty in their eating habits. If she parboiled\r\nit in several waters and then braised it slowly, with a hint of ginger\r\nin the sauce.... Well, after all, why not?\r\n\r\nAmy, the modeling knife in her hand, went into the hothouse again....\r\n\r\n... "Gee, Aunt Amy, this meat\'s good," Robert said. He was talking with\r\nhis mouth full. "I\'ve eaten indigenous chow on three planets--four, if\r\nyou call the stuff they serve you on Uranus food--and it\'s my opinion\r\nthat there isn\'t a better cook anywhere in the system than you. Fact.\r\nHow do you do it, anyhow?"\r\n\r\nAmy Dinsmore lowered her eyes. She could feel herself blushing through\r\nher cosmi-lac. "Oh ... thank you, Robert."\r\n\r\n"She sure is, Bob," Hjalmar Bjornson said expansively. "That gravy!\r\nShe\'s the best cook on Terra all the time, but when you\'re in port she\r\ngets sort of inspired."\r\n\r\n"What kind of meat is this, though, Amy? And could I have some more?"\r\n\r\n"Of course," Amy said. She refilled Hjamar\'s plate. "It\'s something new\r\nI found in the big auto-market in the city," she said vaguely.\r\n\r\n"By the way, Aunt Amy," Bob said, laying down his fork, "after I sent\r\nyou that plant I heard it was supposed to be carnivorous. I forgot to\r\nmention it in my last \'gram. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
You didn\'t get into any trouble with it,\r\ndid you?"\r\n\r\n"No, it died," Amy said smoothly. "I had to throw it out. Too bad." She\r\nbrightened. "Pass your plate, Robert dear," she said.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
