Come in.\r\n    All clear for landing. Over.\r\n\r\n    KOSTOV: Check. Coming in. Speed now ten thousand. Over.\r\n\r\n    GCA: You are now visible in northern sky. Will have drink\r\n    ready. Over.\r\n\r\n    KOSTOV: That you, Ralph?\r\n\r\n    GCA: Yeah, Tony. Welcome back. Will you have that with soda\r\n    or on the rocks?\r\n\r\n    KOSTOV: Straight, with a blonde chaser, if you don\'t mind. You\r\n    say you can see me?\r\n\r\n    GCA: Like Sirius on a clear night. Only one problem.\r\n\r\n    KOSTOV: What\'s that?\r\n\r\n    GCA: You\'re smack in between me and that girl in Omaha. I\r\n    wish you wouldn\'t block the view like that.\r\n\r\n    KOSTOV: I\'ll take my hat off. Better?\r\n\r\n    GCA: Much. Say, what\'s that light on your starboard side?\r\n\r\n    KOSTOV: Light? There shouldn\'t be any....\r\n\r\n(AN EXPLOSION, FOLLOWED BY SOUND OF ROARING FLAME)\r\n\r\n    GCA: Tony! What happened? GCA calling American Beauty!\r\n\r\n    JENSEN: Stewardess to pilot! Stewardess to pilot! The starboard\r\n    fuel tank\'s exploded! Fire in passageway!\r\n\r\n    KOSTOV: Activate all extinguishers--clear the passengers forward--I\'m\r\n    going to close the emergency bulkheads.\r\n\r\n    GCA: My God, it\'s a ball of fire!

Kostov relative to the unfortunate business\r\nof 5/14/68 in which thirty-six passengers and two crewmen lost their\r\nlives. Gave him the news that he is through as a pilot, due to the fact\r\nthat we feel the experience has broken his nerve. Offered him a desk\r\njob, which he declined as expected. Accepted his resignation, effective\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nCOMMENT: Entire incident most unfortunate. Understand that the Line\r\nmight lose passengers to Interplanetary Transport Service if the\r\nAmerican Beauty pilot continued to operate our ships, but regret\r\nthis loss of a valuable employee. Of course he will not be taken on\r\nby any other line, but the profession will be the poorer for the\r\nabsence of this talented, fearless pilot. On the personal level, hope\r\nthat this man of whom all associates were fond will not take out his\r\nunderstandable bitterness in any violent manner.--A. J.

Should this prove true the spaceship, a travel\r\nfixture for two centuries, would soon be obsolete.\r\n\r\nThe principle of the converter-transmitter, long known to scientific\r\nenthusiasts, is that of television carried a step farther. As\r\ntelevision converts voices and images into electrical impulses and\r\nbeams them to a receiving set which reassembles the picture and voice\r\nwhich started out, solid objects are converted, transmitted and\r\nreassembled by this mechanism.\r\n\r\nClearly, workable converter-transmitters would quickly cause the\r\nspaceship to become outmoded, as they would transmit anything and\r\neverything at the speed of light. The moon could be reached in less\r\nthan two seconds, Mars in four minutes.\r\n\r\nThe great question is whether humans could endure the stress of such\r\nan experience. The current speculation has been caused by rumors\r\nthat a leading scientific foundation has secretly started human\r\nexperimentation with a converter-transmitter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    YOUNG MAN WANTED to Take Part in Scientific Experiment.

=== Chunk 3 ===
Name--Anthony Kostov. Claims to be a former space pilot.\r\nFeel that he is the perfect subject--age 28, physically and morally\r\ntough. Most important, however, he is obviously under a compulsion\r\nto prove his courage, due to some incident in his recent past. This\r\ncompulsion should prove helpful in case he learns what happened to\r\nSartorius--Garski.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nREPORT\r\n\r\nFROM   : Council Member #7\r\n\r\nTO     : The Science Council\r\n\r\nSUBJECT: Peiffer Converter-Transmitter\r\n\r\n1. Verified rumor that Nicholas Garski, director of experiment, plans\r\nto use human subject again, despite Council ruling after the Sartorius\r\nincident. He admits this intention, defies Council to stop him.\r\n\r\n2. Ruled that all activity in connection with this experiment be halted\r\npending investigation and ruling of the full Council.\r\n\r\n3. Strongly urge that:\r\n\r\n    a. Garski be permanently restrained from further experimentation\r\n    with the converter-transmitter, as he has proved himself\r\n    irresponsibly reckless.\r\n\r\n    b. The machine be impounded, since neither the Foundation nor its\r\n    agent Garski have exhibited restraint in their handling of this\r\n    tremendous force or respect for the edicts of this Council.\r\n\r\n    c. That Anthony Kostov, the proposed human subject, be acquainted with\r\n    the facts in the case of Steven Sartorius.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM\r\n\r\nFROM: The Science Council\r\n\r\nTO  : Anthony Kostov, c/o Peiffer Science Foundation\r\n\r\nThe attached medical record is forwarded for your attention.\r\n\r\n(Signed) Robert Shepard, President\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSTATE NEURO-PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL\r\n\r\nEVANSTON, ILL.\r\n\r\nCase History 8739\r\n\r\nName__Sartorius, Steven\r\n\r\nDate of Admission__Dec. 18, 2166\r\n\r\nAge at Date of Admission__25\r\n\r\nPatient was employed by Peiffer Science Foundation as electronic\r\nengineer for six years, following graduation summa cum laude from\r\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology. Worked under Dr. Nicholas Garski\r\non the Peiffer converter-transmitter for the three years immediately\r\nprior to his mental collapse. No evidence of psychiatric disturbance\r\nduring these years, in college or in childhood.\r\n\r\nOn Dec. 15, 2166, Sartorius placed himself in the converter-transmitter\r\nand acted as a human guinea pig in an experiment. Appeared dazed but\r\nunhurt after the experience and was placed in bed. Arose late at night,\r\nhowever, and returned to the laboratory.\r\n\r\nQuestioned by a night watchman, he attacked and strangled the man. In\r\nthe morning he was found, in excellent spirits, working on the machine.\r\nAt his feet was the dead body of the watchman.\r\n\r\nPatient cannot be classified as paranoic, as there are no persecution\r\ndelusions, nor does he exhibit symptoms of hebephrenia or catatonia. Is\r\ncool, lucid at all times, but totally unable to distinguish right from\r\nwrong. Inclines toward capricious violent outbursts of the most vicious\r\nsort, as above.\r\n\r\nDiagnosis: Insane, Unclassified. Dangerous.\r\n\r\nPrognosis: Incurable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPEIFFER SCIENCE FOUNDATION\r\n\r\nPROGRESS REPORT\r\n\r\nPROJECT 3889, NICHOLAS GARSKI, DIRECTOR\r\n\r\n27 SEPT., 2168\r\n\r\nThose bumbling amateurs on the Science Council are throwing every\r\npossible roadblock in my path. But they will not stop me. A Council\r\nmember inspected the laboratory last week, ordered me to suspend\r\nall operations, even took care that the complete medical dossier on\r\nSartorius was sent to my volunteer. When the volunteer showed it to\r\nme I freely admitted the accuracy of the record. Told him that if he\r\nwere afraid, he could withdraw and I would understand. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
This brought\r\nhim quickly into line. My theory as to his compulsion was evidently\r\nwell-founded. As to the suspension of operations, I shall see to it\r\nthat it is strictly temporary.--Garski\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Robert Shepard\r\n\r\n_Personal_\r\n\r\nIt is regrettable that your organization has seen fit to interfere with\r\nmy work. If it comes to the hearing before the full Council, I suppose\r\nI shall be forced to bring out the facts about some unfortunate medical\r\nexperiments at the University forty-two years ago. Of course this might\r\nnot bother the august President of the Council. Perhaps he likes to be\r\nreminded of carefree student days....\r\n\r\nG.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDIRECTIVE\r\n\r\nFROM: THE PRESIDENT OF THE SCIENCE COUNCIL\r\n\r\nTO  : All Members\r\n\r\n29 SEPT., 2168\r\n\r\nSUSPENSION OF OPERATIONS ON PROJECT 3889, PEIFFER SCIENCE FOUNDATION,\r\nIS REVOKED EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY AND EXPERIMENTATION WILL BE PERMITTED\r\nTO PROCEED UNHINDERED. SHEPARD, PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Ralph Watson\r\n\r\nGround Control Approach Division\r\n\r\nSpaceport New Dallas, Mars\r\n\r\nDear Ralph:\r\n\r\nI may be seeing you sooner than you expect. Maybe you\'ve read the\r\nrumors about converter-transmitter experiments in the facsimile papers.\r\nWell, that\'s me, baby. I\'m the human cannonball that they\'re going to\r\nshoot through space.\r\n\r\nYou\'ve heard of the Peiffer Foundation. They turned out that stepped-up\r\natomic fuel a couple of years ago. Well, they\'re my new bosses, and an\r\nold bird by the name of Garski is getting ready to load me into his\r\ncannon. And the target is Mars.\r\n\r\nSo if you hear somebody go shooting by your window one of these nights,\r\nhollering, "Look, Ma--no rocket ship!" that\'ll be your old buddy.\r\n\r\nI\'m not exactly crazy about this Garski character--he looks at you like\r\nyou were an interesting smear under a microscope--but I\'m not getting\r\npaid to love him. I\'m getting paid to take a chance, and the money\'s\r\ngood--enough to buy me a tramp ship so I can start my own little line\r\nwhen this is over.\r\n\r\nAnd speaking of lines, tell our friend Bannerman I\'ll be glad to hold\r\nhim on my lap on the return trip--that is, if he\'s got the nerve.\r\n\r\nSee you soon, buddy.\r\n\r\nTony\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPEIFFER SCIENCE FOUNDATION\r\n\r\nPROGRESS REPORT\r\n\r\nPROJECT 3889, NICHOLAS GARSKI, DIRECTOR\r\n\r\n4 OCT., 2168\r\n\r\nAll is in readiness for the final step in the experiment. The volunteer\r\nhas signed a waiver of all claims save that of payment, the mechanism\r\nhas been triple-checked in test runs with inanimate solids. Tomorrow at\r\napproximately 2:30 p.m. Central Standard Time the Earth will come into\r\nthe ideal juxtaposition with Mars. I am confident that the adjustments\r\nI have made in the resistor coils and elsewhere will eliminate all\r\nshock to the subject and success will be mine. But twenty-four hours\r\nfrom now and a galaxy will echo to the name of--Garski\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPEIFFER SCIENCE FOUNDATION\r\n\r\nFINAL REPORT\r\n\r\nPROJECT 3889, NICHOLAS GARSKI, DIRECTOR\r\n\r\n5 OCT., 2168\r\n\r\n(Note: This report made by Laboratory Technician D. J. Williams in the\r\nabsence of Dr. Garski, for the record. Complete report will be made by\r\nthe Doctor upon his return.)\r\n\r\nProject 3889 was today completed. Result: Failure. The subject Kostov\r\nhas been found insane and removed under guard. Dr. Garski left the\r\nlaboratory in a highly agitated state immediately after the experiment\r\nand has not returned. It might be observed by one who was present at\r\nboth experiments that the eyes of the subject Kostov were of the same\r\nlifeless glassiness as those of Sartorius after the first experiment in\r\n\'66.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUNIDENTIFIED BODY DISCOVERED\r\n\r\nChicago, Oct. 6--The body of an elderly man was found floating in Lake\r\nMichigan this morning by fishermen. There was no identification on the\r\nbody, but the clothing seemed to indicate a hospital or laboratory\r\nworker. Suicide was indicated by an unsigned note in a pocket reading,\r\n"I know now what I have done and it is unthinkable."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Journal of Steven Sartorius_\r\n\r\nOct. 6, 2168.... There is another nearby like myself. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
I can feel its\r\npresence. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
This is great news--the time approaches! Soon I will no\r\nlonger have to while away the hours by writing these pages and then\r\ndestroying them before the guards come around. For this other must\r\nsense my presence too, and working together, we will quickly escape\r\nthis house of madness.\r\n\r\nThey have put it in the compartment next to mine. That is excellent. I\r\nwill communicate with it by wall-taps, and we will soon devise a code.\r\nOnce this is done, I will communicate to it my plan for overpowering\r\nthe night guard and we will be away from this place.\r\n\r\nAway--free--free of these fools who class us with lunatics. And of them\r\nall, Garski was the greatest fool. I hear the guards in the hall saying\r\nhe destroyed himself when the second experiment failed.\r\n\r\nFailed, he thought! A fool to the end. It succeeded! Just as the first\r\none did, it succeeded.\r\n\r\nAn answer so beautifully simple, and he never saw it. Garski the\r\nperfectionist, meticulously checking each last detail. And not seeing\r\nthe most important fact of all.\r\n\r\nOf course the machine works--up to a point. The body that is assembled\r\nin the receiving set is physically complete. Atoms and molecules can be\r\nconverted into electrical impulses and beamed through space, for atoms\r\nand molecules are solids. But a soul is not.\r\n\r\nThere is more to a man than atoms and molecules, and that is why I am\r\nnot a man, although I have a man\'s body. Thanks to Garski\'s machine, I\r\nam the first of all time to be free of that foul encumbrance men call a\r\nsoul. The chains of conscience struck off, I am free to destroy those\r\nwho oppose me, to kill--to conquer!\r\n\r\nYes--conquer. For there will be more of us when we have escaped this\r\nprison. I know how to build the machine. And I hear the guards saying\r\nthis other is strong and bold. That is well. What a combination we will\r\nmake, I to create the supermen of tomorrow and my new brother to lead\r\nthem! A terrible army of soulless creatures to enslave these weaklings\r\nthat call themselves men.\r\n\r\nWait! Do I hear a faint tapping?
