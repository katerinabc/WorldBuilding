He was\r\n            on his way to the Moon, but only because that\'s\r\n             where he\'d find the road to all the money he\r\n               could spend. Holt had it all planned....\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n          Science Fiction Adventures Magazine, February 1953.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nA flare of light arced upwards and moments later the shattering report\r\ndinned in the ears of the crowd, rolling across the field like thunder.\r\nThe noise covered the sharply indrawn breath of ten thousand people.\r\nA sonorous voice amplified a millionfold announced: "X Minus Fifteen\r\nMinutes!"\r\n\r\nThere was a second or two of absolute silence and then the waiting\r\ncrowd let out its breath all at once in an audible sigh. They wiped\r\ntheir glasses nervously, or poised their binoculars, or scratched their\r\nheads for the last nervous time, hoping that they would not sneeze at\r\nthe improper second and so miss the takeoff; it would be over just\r\nabout that quickly.\r\n\r\nOut across the field, the focus of ten thousand pairs of eyes, stood\r\nthe _Lady Luna_. She looked small from the crowd, but the three men who\r\nstood at one tail-fin were dwarfed by her size.\r\n\r\n"This is about it, Gordon," said the oldest of the lot.\r\n\r\nGordon Holt nodded. "I\'ve about five minutes yet," he said nervously.\r\n\r\nThe middle-aged man said, "Time for a last cigarette, Gordon."\r\n\r\nHolt shook his head. "Not after training to do without for six months.\r\nSave it until I come back."\r\n\r\nDoctor Walsch nodded. "That\'s good sense, Gordon. We\'ll be waiting for\r\nyou. How do you feel?"\r\n\r\n"Fine. Just a bit jumpy."\r\n\r\n"You ought to feel as fit as a Guarnerius. You\'ve been trained and\r\nyou\'re trim and fit. I doubt that you\'ll ever feel any better in your\r\nlife than you do right now."\r\n\r\nGeneral Towne nodded. "Don\'t forget the honor, either," he said. "The\r\nexcitement should give your high feelings another lift. Imagine being\r\nthe first man to ever set foot on the soil of another world."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a bit of a sterile world, I\'m told. Not much more honor than\r\nthe first man to put his sandal on the top of Pike\'s Peak. They sell\r\npostcards there, now."\r\n\r\n"Too bad we\'ve named all the visible Lunar Craters," said General\r\nTowne. "Seems to me that some signal honor--well, anyway, Gordon, we\'ll\r\nname a big one on the other side after you."\r\n\r\n"It--"\r\n\r\nA siren wailed and Holt jumped. "That\'s it," he said.\r\n\r\n"Good luck, Gordon," said the general, wringing the spaceman\'s hand.\r\nThe doctor clapped Gordon on the back as he turned away.\r\n\r\nDoctor and general got into the waiting jeep, and the driver turned and\r\ncalled, "Don\'t take any wooden moonbeams up there, Holt!"\r\n\r\nHolt shrugged noncommittally and climbed the ramp into the spacelock.\r\nHe sneered at the crowd beyond closing spacelock.\r\n\r\n"Wooden moonbeams?" he said aloud. "Oh brother!"\r\n\r\nHe went to the control chamber of the _Lady Luna_ and ran through his\r\nchecklist almost mechanically. He waited almost breathlessly until the\r\nradio barked the word that told him to hit the ignition switch, and\r\nwhen it came he hit it with a vigor and enjoyed the crushing sensation\r\nthat followed. The thunder from below was music in his ears; now he was\r\non his way and they wouldn\'t call him back.\r\n\r\nHolt was no mere glory machine. Not for him was the simple honor. He\r\nhad it planned, had it planned from the moment he was selected.\r\n\r\nFor Holt, the honor of setting the first foot on another world was a\r\nflat and tasteless award. It would last only until someone else did\r\nsomething slightly better. What could he get out of driving a space\r\nrocket to Luna? Not a hell of a lot. He was not headed for an adventure\r\nand he knew it; with everything precalculated, including the risk, what\r\nadventure could he have? To land and collect a quart of pumice and a\r\npound of rock and maybe a shiny stone. Look for lichen or moss. Listen\r\nto the Geiger.\r\n\r\nThis sort of dry action would sell no books, collect no royalties,\r\nmake no moving pictures, bring in no dough.\r\n\r\nGordon took a deep breath as soon as the motor cut off. He was on his\r\nway and he knew how to handle everything from here on in.\r\n\r\nHe had seen enough of human nature to foresee it all. A slight mishap\r\nand a call for help would start it. A landing just hard enough to bend\r\nthe control vanes or to plug up the rocket exhaust. Maybe to dinge up\r\nthe spacecraft enough to make it unspaceworthy. Then--\r\n\r\nThe cry for help and the whole world crying in return that a Human\r\nBeing was marooned out there, helpless and alone.\r\n\r\nThey\'d come.\r\n\r\nThey\'d turn handsprings to get out there. Time and money would be\r\ntossed down the drain, and men would strive and women would cry, and\r\nthe news would be filled with daily columns of how the rescue was\r\nprogressing.\r\n\r\nDrop a man in the ocean and the navies of every country go out and comb\r\nthe sea to find him. Put a cat on the telephone pole and three hundred\r\npeople struggle to get the animal down. Drop a child in a well and the\r\ncountryside turns out en masse to help.\r\n\r\nWell, maroon a man on the moon and watch \'em struggle.\r\n\r\nHe had air for ninety days and food and water and just about anything\r\na man would need. He could sit it out and he knew it. And he knew that\r\nthere was a second rocket that could be put in space within a couple of\r\nmonths. Sixty days he\'d sit it out and then--\r\n\r\nIt would be the story of his life, the tale of his rescue, the bright\r\nlights and the personal appearances. Radio and television and endorsing\r\nthis junk and that googoo. Women and liquor and money.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe came down in the Crater Plato, tail first but far too fast. The\r\ntailfins crumpled and the sifting pumice drove up into the exhaust and\r\npacked like cement. A seam whistled far below to let out some air from\r\na sealed compartment, cracked in the bump.\r\n\r\nThe crash staggered him a bit, but all he suffered was a nosebleed and\r\na set of sprained chest muscles. He sat up and looked around.\r\n\r\nThe radio. He snapped it on and called: "_Lady Luna_ Gordon Holt\r\nreporting. Made a crash landing. May be dangerous. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
Will check and call\r\nat 0300."\r\n\r\nHe eyed the radio thoughtfully; it only took about three seconds for\r\nan answer, but in that time Gordon considered smashing the radio in\r\nthe middle of the next broadcast and then discarded the idea because\r\nit might lead people to think that he, too, had been smashed. Gordon\r\nwanted to be rescued, not given a hero\'s brief hail and farewell.\r\n\r\n"Calling _Lady Luna_. Holt! 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Are you all right? Explain!"\r\n\r\n"I am all right. I am not hurt. Crash landing rather rough but nothing\r\nbroken. No air leakage, nothing completely ruined that I can tell.\r\nLanded as per program in the dead center of Plato, but a little too\r\nhard."\r\n\r\nThat ought to do it. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Let \'em get excited slowly. They\'ll forget me less\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\n"_Lady Luna_ what happened?" They were worried.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. I have a hunch that the pumice does not provide a true\r\nground-plane for the radar. We landed as though the ground were about\r\nthirty feet below the surface."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat sounds logical. Such things are entirely possible, I\'m told.\r\nPowdery, filmy stuff with no water shouldn\'t have a firm ground-plane.\r\n\r\n"_Lady Luna_ inspect your damage and report as planned at 0300."\r\n\r\nHolt checked his air first. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Plenty of it. Not a bit gone. Water next\r\nand food next. He checked the hull as well as he could from the inside\r\nand then went out in his space suit to view the damage.\r\n\r\nHe had done an admirable job. The tail fins were bent messily and the\r\nhull was crumpled a bit just above the place where the rocket motor\r\nended. If this ship took off--\r\n\r\n"_Lady Luna_ calling home. Reporting as per plan. Hull bent, tail fins\r\nruined. Crater filled with powdery pumice and I feel that the exhaust\r\nis packed. Shall I try a blast to clear it?"\r\n\r\nWhile he waited for the answer Gordon found a bit of wire and shorted\r\nthe battery for a second. He had to fade out slowly enough to fool them\r\ncompletely.\r\n\r\n"_Lady Luna_, do not try a clearing blast. You\'ll explode. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Wait for\r\ninstructions."\r\n\r\n"Will do. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Will do."\r\n\r\nHe shorted the battery a couple more times and watched the voltmeter\r\ndrop.\r\n\r\n"_Lady Luna_ can you dig down to the exhaust port?"\r\n\r\n"Will try. Note battery dropping. Nothing else in danger. Food, water,\r\nair all okay. Hull sound but battery dropping."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSeconds went on and Holt could see the resources of the entire world\r\ncollecting to prepare the First Spacewreck Rescue. Complete with\r\nvideo, reporters, clergymen, politicians, and humanity waiting.\r\n\r\n"_Lady Luna_ repeat. You are fading."\r\n\r\nHolt repeated, insisting that he was all right. "I can stick it out. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
I\r\ncan stick it out."\r\n\r\nHe watched the radio battery fade.\r\n\r\nLet it fade. He could stand the silence for two months until rescue\r\ncame.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA billion people listened to his voice die away. And when their radio\r\nnetworks went dead, they raced to their telephones and clogged the land\r\nwires demanding that something had to be done.\r\n\r\nCongressmen gave speeches and clergymen spoke and doctors gave opinions\r\nand scientists differed. A government seldom known for its cooperation\r\nannounced that its new atomic-powered rocket was about to effect the\r\nrescue single-handedly. But the atomic part blew up in front of the\r\nvideo cameras and took some of the landscape with it. The Council\r\nof the United Nations called a meeting. The newspapers and networks\r\ncovered everything.\r\n\r\nA man known for his brilliance came on the air.\r\n\r\n"The batteries of the _Lady Luna_ have run down," he said. "We must\r\nget there in less than ten days."\r\n\r\nThey tried to do it.\r\n\r\nA second rocket exploded in France.\r\n\r\nA third blew up in Germany.\r\n\r\nThe fourth would not be ready for space for sixty days.\r\n\r\nThat was seventy long days after Holt\'s landing.\r\n\r\nWithout a miracle, Holt would be dead, even if the experts were wrong.\r\n\r\nProtestants prayed, Catholics crossed themselves, and Mohammedans\r\ncalled it _kismet_ and let it go at that. A scientist suggested that\r\nsince there was no habitable planet in the solar system and that\r\nmankind could never reach the stars, there was small point in this\r\neffort to make space travel pay off. An economist computed the sum of\r\nmoney shelled out already and called it damned foolishness. A Senator\r\nMaculay suggested that taxes could be lowered if such expenditures were\r\ncut out.\r\n\r\nAnd ten days after the accident there was a world-wide prayer said for\r\nGordon Holt.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe other rocket at White Sands grew cobwebs in its empty fuel tanks.\r\n\r\nAnd the _Lady Luna_ slipped into the dark of the moon. It grew colder\r\nand colder as time went on....\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
