SHEA_\r\n\r\n\r\n They had been cramped for space, him and his people.\r\n Obviously this new age had solved the problem better.\r\n\r\n\r\n"You\'re a fascinating person," the girl said. "I\'ve never met anyone\r\nlike you before.

Tell me your story again."\r\n\r\nThe man was short and stocky, with Asiatic features and a long, stringy\r\nmustache. "The whole story?" he asked. "It would take a lifetime to tell\r\nyou." He stared out the window at the yellow sun and the red sun. He\r\nstill hadn\'t gotten used to seeing two suns. But that was minor, really,\r\nwhen there were so many other things he had to get used to.\r\n\r\nA robot waiter, with long thin metal tubes for arms and legs, glided\r\nover. When he\'d first seen one of those, he\'d thought it was a demon.\r\nHe\'d tried to smash it. They\'d had trouble with him at first.\r\n\r\n"They had trouble with me at first," he said.\r\n\r\n"I can imagine," said the girl. "How did they explain it to you?

"\r\n\r\n"It was hard. They had to give me the whole history of medicine. It was\r\nyears before I got over the notion that I was up in the Everlasting Blue\r\nSky, or under the earth, or something." He grinned at the girl. She was\r\nthe first person he\'d met since they got him a job and gave him a home\r\nin a world uncountable light years from the one he\'d been born on.\r\n\r\n"When did you begin to understand?"\r\n\r\n"They simply taught all of history to me. Including the part about\r\nmyself. Then I began to get the picture. Funny. I wound up teaching them\r\na lot of history."\r\n\r\n"I bet you know a lot."\r\n\r\n"I do," the man with the Asiatic features said modestly. "Anyway, they\r\nfinally got across to me that in the 22nd century--they had explained\r\nthe calendar to me, too; I used a different one in my day--they had\r\nlearned how to grow new limbs on people who had lost arms and legs."\r\n\r\n"That was the first real step," said the girl.\r\n\r\n"It was a long time till they got to the second step," he said. "They\r\nlearned how to stimulate life and new growth in people who had already\r\ndied."\r\n\r\n"The next part is the thing I don\'t understand," the girl said.\r\n\r\n"Well," said the man, "as I get it, they found that any piece of matter\r\nthat has been part of an organism, retains a physical \'memory\' of the\r\nentire structure of the organism of which it was part. And that they\r\ncould reconstruct that structure from a part of a person, if that was\r\nall there was left of him. From there it was just a matter of pushing\r\nthe process back through time. They had to teach me a whole new language\r\nto explain that one."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it wonderful that intergalactic travel gives us room to expand?"\r\nsaid the girl. "I mean now that every human being that ever lived has\r\nbeen brought back to life and will live forever?"\r\n\r\n"Same problem I had, me and my people," said the man. "We were cramped\r\nfor space. This age has solved it a lot better than I did.

But they had\r\nto give me a whole psychological overhauling before I understood that."\r\n\r\n"Tell me about your past life," said the girl, staring dreamily at him.\r\n\r\n"Well, six thousand years ago, I was born in the Gobi Desert, on Earth,"\r\nsaid Genghis Khan, sipping his drink.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ December 1957.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.
