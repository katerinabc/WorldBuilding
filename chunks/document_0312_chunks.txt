However,\r\nwhen the bell rang, she was wearing her new Chinese red housecoat, had\r\njust lustered her nails to a blinding scarlet, and Harry Junior was\r\nsleeping like an angel.\r\n\r\nYawning, Melinda answered the door and the little man said, beaming,\r\n"Excellent day. I have geegaws for information.

=== Chunk 2 ===
"\r\n\r\nMelinda did not quite recoil. He was perhaps five feet tall, with a\r\ngleaming hairless scalp and a young-old face. He wore a plain gray\r\ntunic, and a peddler\'s tray hung from his thin shoulders.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t want any," Melinda stated flatly.\r\n\r\n"_Please._" He had great, beseeching amber eyes. "They all say that. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
I\r\nhaven\'t much time. I must be back at the University by noon."\r\n\r\n"You working your way through college?"\r\n\r\nHe brightened. "Yes. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
I suppose you could call it that. Alien\r\nanthropology major."\r\n\r\nMelinda softened. The initiations those frats pulled nowadays--shaving\r\nthe poor guy\'s head, eating goldfish--it was criminal.\r\n\r\n"Well?" she asked grudgingly. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
"What\'s in the tray?"\r\n\r\n"Flanglers," said the little man eagerly. "Oscilloscopes. Portable\r\nforce-field generators. A neural distorter." Melinda\'s face was blank.\r\nThe little man frowned. "You use them, of course? This _is_ a Class IV\r\nculture?" Melinda essayed a weak shrug and the little man sighed with\r\nrelief. His eyes fled past her to the blank screen of the TV set. "Ah, a\r\nmonitor." He smiled. "For a moment I was afraid--May I come in?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMelinda shrugged, opened the door. This might be interesting, like a\r\nvacuum-cleaner salesman who had cleaned her drapes last week for free.\r\nAnd Kitty Kyle Battles Life wouldn\'t be on for almost an hour.\r\n\r\n"My name is Porteous," said the little man with an eager smile. "I\'m\r\ndoing a thematic on Class IV cultures." 

=== Chunk 6 ===
He whipped out a stylus, began\r\njotting down notes. The TV set fascinated him.\r\n\r\n"It\'s turned off right now," Melinda said.\r\n\r\nPorteous\'s eyes widened impossibly. "You mean," he whispered in horror,\r\n"that you\'re exercising Class V privileges? This is terribly confusing.\r\nI get doors slammed in my face, when Class Fours are supposed to have a\r\nsplendid gregarian quotient--you _do_ have atomic power, don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, sure," said Melinda uncomfortably. This wasn\'t going to be much\r\nfun.\r\n\r\n"Space travel?" The little face was intent, sharp.\r\n\r\n"Well," Melinda yawned, looking at the blank screen, "they\'ve got Space\r\nPatrol, Space Cadet, Tales of Tomorrow ..."\r\n\r\n"Excellent. Rocket ships or force-fields?" Melinda blinked. "Does your\r\nhusband own one?" Melinda shook her blonde head helplessly. "What are\r\nyour economic circumstances?"\r\n\r\nMelinda took a deep rasping breath, said, "Listen, mister, is this a\r\ndemonstration or a quiz program?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, my excuse. Demonstration, certainly. You will not mind the\r\nquestions?"\r\n\r\n"Questions?" There was an ominous glint in Melinda\'s blue eyes.\r\n\r\n"Your delightful primitive customs, art-forms, personal habits--"\r\n\r\n"Look," Melinda said, crimsoning. "This is a respectable neighborhood,\r\nand I\'m not answering any Kinsey report, understand?"\r\n\r\nThe little man nodded, scribbling. "Personal habits are tabu? I so\r\nregret. The demonstration." He waved grandly at the tray. "Anti-grav\r\nsandals? A portable solar converter? Apologizing for this miserable\r\nselection, but on Capella they told me--" He followed Melinda\'s\r\nentranced gaze, selected a tiny green vial. "This is merely a\r\nregenerative solution. You appear to have no cuts or bruises."\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Melinda nastily. "Cures warts, cancer, grows hair, I\r\nsuppose."\r\n\r\nPorteous brightened. "Of course. I see you can scan. Amazing." He\r\nscribbled further with his stylus, glanced up, blinked at the obvious\r\nscorn on Melinda\'s face. "Here. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Try it."\r\n\r\n"You try it." Now watch him squirm!\r\n\r\nPorteous hesitated. "Would you like me to grow an extra finger, hair--"\r\n\r\n"Grow some hair." Melinda tried not to smile.\r\n\r\nThe little man unstopped the vial, poured a shimmering green drop on his\r\nwrist, frowning.\r\n\r\n"Must concentrate," he said. "Thorium base, suspended solution. Really\r\njolts the endocrines, complete control ... see?

=== Chunk 8 ===
"\r\n\r\nMelinda\'s jaw dropped. She stared at the tiny tuft of hair which had\r\nsprouted on that bare wrist. She was thinking abruptly, unhappily, about\r\nthat chignon she had bought yesterday. They had let her buy that for\r\neight dollars when with this stuff she could have a natural one.\r\n\r\n"How much?" she inquired cautiously.\r\n\r\n"A half hour of your time only," said Porteous.\r\n\r\nMelinda grasped the vial firmly, settled down on the sofa with one leg\r\ntucked carefully under her.\r\n\r\n"Okay, shoot. But nothing personal.

=== Chunk 9 ===
"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPorteous was delighted. He asked a multitude of questions, most of them\r\npointless, some naive, and Melinda dug into her infinitesimal fund of\r\nknowledge and gave. The little man scribbled furiously, clucking like a\r\ngravid hen.\r\n\r\n"You mean," he asked in amazement, "that you live in these primitive\r\nhuts of your own volition?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s a G.I. housing project," Melinda said, ashamed.\r\n\r\n"Astonishing." He wrote: _Feudal anachronisms and atomic power, side by\r\nside. Class Fours periodically "rough it" in back-to-nature movements._\r\n\r\nHarry Junior chose that moment to begin screaming for his lunch.\r\nPorteous sat, trembling. "Is that a Security Alarm?"\r\n\r\n"My son," said Melinda despondently, and went into the nursery.\r\n\r\nPorteous followed, and watched the ululating child with some\r\ntrepidation. "Newborn?"\r\n\r\n"Eighteen months," said Melinda stiffly, changing diapers. "He\'s cutting\r\nteeth."\r\n\r\nPorteous shuddered. "What a pity. Obviously atavistic. Wouldn\'t the\r\ncreche accept him? You shouldn\'t have to keep him here."\r\n\r\n"I keep after Harry to get a maid, but he says we can\'t afford one."\r\n\r\n"Manifestly insecure," muttered the little man, studying Harry Junior.\r\n"Definite paranoid tendencies."\r\n\r\n"He was two weeks premature," volunteered Melinda. "He\'s real\r\nsensitive."\r\n\r\n"I know just the thing," Porteous said happily. "Here." He dipped into\r\nthe glittering litter on the tray and handed Harry Junior a translucent\r\nprism. "A neural distorter. We use it to train regressives on Rigel Two.\r\nIt might be of assistance."\r\n\r\nMelinda eyed the thing doubtfully. Harry Junior was peering into the\r\nshifting crystal depths with a somewhat strained expression.\r\n\r\n"Speeds up the neural flow," explained the little man proudly. "Helps\r\ntap the unused eighty per cent. The pre-symptomatic memory is\r\nunaffected, due to automatic cerebral lapse in case of overload. I\'m\r\nafraid it won\'t do much more than cube his present IQ, and an\r\nintelligent idiot is still an idiot, but--"\r\n\r\n"How dare you?" Melinda\'s eyes flashed. "My son is _not_ an idiot! You\r\nget out of here this minute and take your--things with you." As she\r\nreached for the prism, Harry Junior squalled. Melinda relented. "Here,"\r\nshe said angrily, fumbling with her purse. "How much are they?"\r\n\r\n"Medium of exchange?" Porteous rubbed his bald skull. "Oh, I really\r\nshouldn\'t--but it\'ll make such a wonderful addendum to the chapter on\r\nmalignant primitives. What is your smallest denomination?"\r\n\r\n"Is a dollar okay?" Melinda was hopeful.\r\n\r\nPorteous was pleased with the picture of George Washington. He turned\r\nthe bill over and over in his fingers, at last bowed low and formally,\r\napologized for any tabu violations, and left via the front door.\r\n\r\n"Crazy fraternities," muttered Melinda, turning on the TV set.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKitty Kyle was dull that morning. At length Melinda used some of the\r\nliquid in the green vial on her eyelashes, was quite pleased at the\r\nresults, and hid the rest in the medicine cabinet.\r\n\r\nHarry Junior was a model of docility the rest of that day. While Melinda\r\nwatched TV and munched chocolates, did and re-did her hair, Harry Junior\r\nplayed quietly with the crystal prism.\r\n\r\nToward late afternoon, he crawled over to the bookcase, wrestled down\r\nthe encyclopedia and pawed through it, gurgling with delight. He\r\ndefinitely, Melinda decided, would make a fine lawyer someday, not a\r\nuseless putterer like Big Harry, who worked all hours overtime in that\r\ndamned lab. She scowled as Harry Junior, bored with the encyclopedia,\r\nbegan reaching for one of Big Harry\'s tomes on nuclear physics. One\r\nputterer in the family was enough! But when she tried to take the book\r\naway from him, Harry Junior howled so violently that she let well enough\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nAt six-thirty, Big Harry called from the lab, with the usual despondent\r\nmessage that he would not be home for supper. Melinda said a few\r\nresigned things about cheerless dinners eaten alone, hinted darkly what\r\nlonesome wives sometimes did for company, and Harry said he was very\r\nsorry, but this might be _it_, and Melinda hung up on him in a temper.\r\n\r\nPrecisely fifteen minutes later, the doorbell rang. Melinda opened the\r\nfront door and gaped. This little man could have been Porteous\'s double,\r\nexcept for the black metallic tunic, the glacial gray eyes.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Melinda Adams?" Even the voice was frigid.\r\n\r\n"Y-Yes. Why--"\r\n\r\n"Major Nord, Galactic Security." The little man bowed. "You were visited\r\nearly this morning by one Porteous." He spoke the name with a certain\r\ndisgust. "He left a neural distorter here. Correct?"\r\n\r\nMelinda\'s nod was tremulous. Major Nord came quietly into the living\r\nroom, shut the door behind him. "My apologies, madam, for the intrusion.\r\nPorteous mistook your world for a Class IV culture, instead of a Class\r\nVII. Here--" He handed her the crumpled dollar bill. "You may check the\r\nserial number. The distorter, please."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMelinda shrunk limply onto the sofa. "I don\'t understand," she said\r\npainfully. "Was he a thief?"\r\n\r\n"He was--careless about his spatial coordinates." Major Nord\'s teeth\r\nshowed in the faintest of smiles. "He has been corrected. Where is it?"\r\n\r\n"Now look," said Melinda with some asperity. "That thing\'s kept Harry\r\nJunior quiet all day. I bought it in good faith, and it\'s not my\r\nfault--say, have you got a warrant?"\r\n\r\n"Madam," said the Major with dignity, "I dislike violating local tabus,\r\nbut must I explain the impact of a neural distorter on a backwater\r\nculture? What if your Neanderthal had been given atomic blasters? Where\r\nwould you have been today? Swinging through trees, no doubt. What if\r\nyour Hitler had force-fields?" He exhaled. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
"Where is your son?"\r\n\r\nIn the nursery, Harry Junior was contentedly playing with his blocks.\r\nThe prism lay glinting in the corner.\r\n\r\nMajor Nord picked it up carefully, scrutinized Harry Junior. His voice\r\nwas very soft.\r\n\r\n"You said he was--playing with it?"\r\n\r\nSome vestigial maternal instinct prompted Melinda to shake her head\r\nvigorously. The little man stared hard at Harry Junior, who began\r\nwhimpering. Trembling, Melinda scooped up Harry Junior.\r\n\r\n"Is _that_ all you have to do--run around frightening women and\r\nchildren? Take your old distorter and get out. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
Leave decent people\r\nalone!"\r\n\r\nMajor Nord frowned. If only he could be sure. He peered stonily at Harry\r\nJunior, murmured, "Definite egomania. It doesn\'t seem to have affected\r\nhim. 

=== Chunk 12 ===
Strange."\r\n\r\n"Do you want me to scream?" Melinda demanded.\r\n\r\nMajor Nord sighed. He bowed to Melinda, went out, closed the door,\r\ntouched a tiny stud on his tunic, and vanished.\r\n\r\n"The manners of some people," Melinda said to Harry Junior. She was\r\nrelieved that the Major had not asked for the green vial.\r\n\r\nHarry Junior also looked relieved, although for quite a different\r\nreason.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBig Harry arrived home a little after eleven. There were small worry\r\ncreases about his mouth and forehead, and the leaden cast of defeat in\r\nhis eyes. He went into the bedroom and Melinda sleepily told him about\r\nthe little man working his way through college by peddling silly goods,\r\nand about that rude cop named Nord, and Harry said that was simply\r\nastonishing and Melinda said, "Harry, you had a drink!"\r\n\r\n"I had two drinks," Harry told her owlishly. "You married a failure,\r\ndear. Part of the experimental model vaporized, _wooosh_, just like\r\nthat. On paper it looked so good--"\r\n\r\nMelinda had heard it all before. She asked him to see if Harry Junior\r\nwas covered, and Big Harry went unsteadily into the nursery, sat down by\r\nhis son\'s crib.\r\n\r\n"Poor little guy," he mused. "Your old man\'s a bum, a useless tinker. He\r\nthought he could send Man to the stars on a string of helium nuclei. Oh,\r\nhe was smart. Thought of everything. Auxiliary jets to kick off the\r\nnegative charge, bigger mercury vapor banks--a fine straight thrust of\r\npositive Alpha particles." He hiccuped, put his face in his hands.\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t you ever stop to think that a few air molecules could defocus\r\nthe stream? Try a vacuum, stupid."\r\n\r\nBig Harry stood up.\r\n\r\n"Did you say something, son?"\r\n\r\n"Gurfle," said Harry Junior.\r\n\r\nBig Harry reeled into the living room like a somnambulist.\r\n\r\nHe got pencil and paper, began jotting frantic formulae. Presently he\r\ncalled a cab and raced back to the laboratory.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMelinda was dreaming about little bald men with diamond-studded trays.\r\nThey were chasing her, they kept pelting her with rubies and emeralds,\r\nall they wanted was to ask questions, but she kept running, Harry Junior\r\nclasped tightly in her arms. Now they were ringing alarm bells. The\r\nbells kept ringing and she groaned, sat up in bed, and seized the\r\ntelephone.\r\n\r\n"Darling." Big Harry\'s voice shook. "I\'ve got it! More auxiliary\r\nshielding plus a vacuum. We\'ll be rich!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s just fine," said Melinda crossly. "You woke the baby."\r\n\r\nHarry Junior was sobbing bitterly into his pillow. He was sick with\r\ndisappointment. Even the most favorable extrapolation showed it would\r\ntake him nineteen years to become master of the world.\r\n\r\nAn eternity. Nineteen years!\r\n\r\n                                                        --JAMES CAUSEY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Galaxy Science Fiction_ January 1953.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.
