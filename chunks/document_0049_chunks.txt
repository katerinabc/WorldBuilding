FONTENAY\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the morning inspection tour, Tardo, the Solar Council\'s Planetary\r\nAid agent, and his companion, Peo, were taken to the castle which stood\r\non a hill overlooking the area.\r\n\r\nTardo and Peo were entertained royally at luncheon by Saranta, their\r\nhost, who appeared to be the wealthy overlord of this portion of the\r\nplanet. The meal was delicious--tender, inch-thick steaks served with\r\ndelicate wine sauce and half a dozen of the planet\'s exotic vegetables,\r\ntopped off by a cool fruit dessert.\r\n\r\n"My recommendation will be of considerable importance to you," said\r\nTardo as they ate.

"If it is favorable, there is certain technical aid\r\naboard ship which will be made available to you at once. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Of course, you\r\nwill not receive advanced equipment from the Solar Council until there\r\nis a more thorough investigation."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid our culture is too simple and agrarian to win your\r\napproval," said Saranta modestly.\r\n\r\n"That isn\'t a major consideration. The Council understands the\r\ndifficulties that have faced colonies in other star systems. There are\r\ncertain fundamental requirements, of course: no abnormal religious\r\npractices, no slavery ... well, you understand what I mean."\r\n\r\n"We really feel that we have done well since we ... our ancestors, that\r\nis ... colonized our world a thousand years ago," said Saranta, toying\r\nwith a wineglass. A smiling servant filled the glasses of Tardo and Peo.\r\n"You see, there was no fuel for the ship to explore other planets in the\r\nsystem, and the ship just rusted away. Since we are some distance from\r\nthe solar system, yours is the first ship that has landed here since\r\ncolonization."\r\n\r\n"You seem to have been lucky, though," said Peo. He was navigator of the\r\nCouncil ship, and had asked to accompany Tardo on the brief inspection\r\ntrip. "You could have landed on a barren planet."\r\n\r\n"Well, no, the colonizers knew it was liveable, from the first\r\nexploration expedition," said Saranta. "There were difficulties, of\r\ncourse. Luxuriant vegetation, but no animal life, so we had no animals\r\nto domesticate. Pulling a plow is hard work for a man."\r\n\r\n"But you were able to solve this situation in a humanitarian way?" asked\r\nTardo, peering at him keenly.

"That is to say, you didn\'t resort to\r\nslavery?"\r\n\r\nSaranta smiled and spread his hands slightly.\r\n\r\n"Does this look like a slave society to you?" he countered. "The\r\ncolonists were anxious to co-operate to make the planet liveable. No one\r\nobjected to work."\r\n\r\n"It\'s true we\'ve seen no slaves, that we know about," said Tardo. "But\r\ntwo days is a short time for inspection. I must draw most of my\r\nconclusions from the attitudes of you and the others who are our hosts.\r\nHow about the servants here?"\r\n\r\n"They are paid," answered Saranta, and added ruefully: "There are those\r\nof us who think they are paid too well. They have a union, you know."\r\n\r\nTardo laughed.\r\n\r\n"A carry-over from Earth, no doubt," he commented. "An unusual one, too,\r\nfor a culture without technology."\r\n\r\nWhen the meal was over, the two men from the ship were conducted on a\r\ntour of the area. It was a neat agricultural community, with broad\r\nfields, well-constructed buildings and, a short distance from Saranta\'s\r\ncastle-like home, a village in which artisans and craftsmen plied their\r\npeaceful trades.\r\n\r\nPeo tried to notice what he thought Tardo would look for on such a short\r\ninspection. The Council agent, he knew, had had intensive training and\r\nmany years of experience. It was hard for Peo to judge what factors\r\nTardo would consider significant--probably very minor ones that the\r\naverage man would not notice, he thought.\r\n\r\nTardo had seemed most intent on the question of slavery, and Peo looked\r\nfor signs of it. He could see none. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
The people of the planet had had\r\ntime to conceal some things, of course. But the people they saw in the\r\nvillage wore a proud air of independence no slave could assume.\r\n\r\nSaranta apologized for their having to walk, explaining that there was\r\nno other means of transportation on the planet.\r\n\r\n"And, without transportation, you can understand why we have not been\r\nable to develop a technology," he added. "We hope transport will be\r\nincluded in the first assistance you will give us."\r\n\r\nTardo asked about the fields.\r\n\r\n"I see there is no one working them," he said. "Is that done by the\r\nvillagers?"\r\n\r\n"Our labor supply is transient," answered Saranta after a moment\'s\r\nhesitation. "The laborers who will work our fields--for a wage, of\r\ncourse--are probably in the next town or the one beyond it now."\r\n\r\nAlpha Persei was sinking in the western sky when Tardo and Peo took\r\ntheir leave of Saranta and made their way down the road toward their\r\nplanetary landing craft.\r\n\r\n"It looks like a good world to me," said Peo. "If tomorrow\'s inspection\r\nis as satisfactory, I suppose you will recommend the beginning of\r\ntechnical aid?"\r\n\r\n"There will be no inspection tour tomorrow, and I shall recommend\r\nagainst aid at this time," replied Tardo. "I\'ve seen enough."\r\n\r\n"Why?" asked Peo, surprised.\r\n\r\n"There are two classes of people on this planet, and we\'ve seen only\r\none," said Tardo. "Those we have seen are freemen. The others are no\r\nbetter than animals. We give no aid that helps men tighten their hold\r\nover their fellows."\r\n\r\n"If you haven\'t seen them, how do you know there is another class?"\r\ndemanded Peo. "There is no evidence of any such situation."\r\n\r\n"The evidence is well hidden. But if you think your stomach can take it\r\nnow, I\'ll tell you. If you remember your history, colonizing ships 1000\r\nyears ago had no space to carry animals along. They had to depend on\r\nnative animal life of the planet, and this planet had none."\r\n\r\n"Saranta said that. But I don\'t see ..."\r\n\r\n"Those were delicious steaks, weren\'t they?" remarked Tardo quietly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _If Worlds of Science Fiction_\r\n    September 1954.
