]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sign said: RIDE THE ROCKET! TWICE AROUND THE UNIVERSE FOR 25\xc2\xa2!\r\nWhich was cheap enough, Pete Moore thought. Cheap enough at twice the\r\nfare.\r\n\r\nGlory giggled and pulled at his arm. "Let\'s ride, Pete. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Let\'s see what\r\nyou\'re in for."\r\n\r\nHe smiled down at her thinly, because it wasn\'t really anything for\r\nher to giggle about, but that was Glory for you. She was young enough,\r\ngay enough, to be able to make a joke of it, and that was good and he\r\nshouldn\'t spoil it. Not many other wives would feel like that. Not many\r\nother wives would want to spend his last night home on the midway, for\r\nthat matter. But then again, that was Glory.\r\n\r\nHe listened to the tinny carousel music and the babble of the crowd,\r\nthe laughter and the mingled drone of barkers. He smelled the tang\r\nof roasting popcorn and the hot-doggy stink of the lunchcounters. He\r\nlooked at the ferris wheel and the crazy swoop of lights that was the\r\nscenic railway and the people crowding along the boardwalk with kewpie\r\ndolls and spun-sugar candy cones in their hands.\r\n\r\nQuestion! his mind demanded: Is this reality?\r\n\r\nAnswer: Of course. What else?\r\n\r\nI\'ve been too long away from cities, he thought. Too many silent nights\r\nin the desert, too many high flights in cold blue air. Too long away\r\nfrom Glory?\r\n\r\nHe felt guilty and depressed at the thought. It wasn\'t the way for a\r\nman to feel. Not before the great adventure. Still, he couldn\'t avoid\r\nan almost homesick longing for the deep darkness of the desert and the\r\nsilver ship waiting there.\r\n\r\nSoon, he thought. Three days; three days and a few hours.\r\n\r\nHe felt a tug at his arm.\r\n\r\n"Pete!" Glory was smiling up at him, half-aggrieved, half-loving. He\r\nlooked again at the garishly painted sign.\r\n\r\nRIDE THE ROCKET!\r\n\r\n"Let\'s ride it, Pete," Glory said. "Let\'s!"\r\n\r\nThere was something in her smile that touched him. Pride? That, and\r\nlove and youth. To her, he was _the_ man. For her, and for all the\r\nworld. The one who was going to reach out beyond the far horizon and\r\ntouch the sky and bring back a pot of gold for everyone.\r\n\r\nShe thinks no one else could do it, he told himself. That\'s love. There\r\nwere a dozen qualified men, and yet--\r\n\r\nThe moonshot was his.\r\n\r\nRIDE THE ROCKET!\r\n\r\n"All right, baby," he said.\r\n\r\nAs he paid their fare for the rocket-ride, Pete found himself looking\r\nat the girl in the booth. Tired eyes and stringy hennaed hair. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
No\r\ndreams there. He had an impulse to tell her that soon he\'d really be\r\nriding the rocket and that from then on things would be different.\r\n\r\nNew frontiers and new dreams for everybody. Up and up.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe girl\'s eyes met his, and it was Pete who looked away. You don\'t\r\ntalk frontiers to pale, worn faces and eyes bleached of color by tinny\r\nmusic and stinks and men.\r\n\r\nThey walked up a wooden ramp to where a little metal bullet on rails\r\nwaited. The paint, once bright, was all scuffy. A sour-faced attendant\r\nin grayish coveralls stood by a large lever.\r\n\r\n"Fasten ya seat belts, Mac."\r\n\r\n"We\'re off to the sky," Glory said.\r\n\r\nSomewhere old machinery wheezed.\r\n\r\nThe little bullet began to move along the rails toward a hinged\r\ntrap-door in a wall painted to look like clouds.\r\n\r\n"Hold my hand, Pete," Glory said breathlessly.\r\n\r\nGlory, Glory, he thought. Young and simple and in love with life. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Any\r\nkind of life. Real or unreal. Glory with a bubbling laughter, a zest, a\r\nfaith. Maybe it was really for her that he was taking the big flight.\r\nIf only he could bring back the pot of gold. If only he could tell\r\nweary Man that the sky was all his. He thought of the strained, unhappy\r\nfaces in the streets, the fear-filled eyes. If he could return and say\r\nto them: "Here\'s your new frontier!" Yes, by God, it was worth the\r\nwork, and the risk. Glory was right. It was something to be proud of.\r\n\r\nI\'m going to the moon!\r\n\r\nMe, Pete Moore, to the _moon_!\r\n\r\n"There it is, Pete!"\r\n\r\nThey had bumped through the painted door into a musty semi-darkness.\r\nThe walls were perforated with holes for stars, and from somewhere\r\nbelow a huge yellowish moon was rising.\r\n\r\nOff a short way to the right was a glowing papier-m\xc3\xa2ch\xc3\xa9 globe painted\r\nwith broad bands slightly askew, and behind that was another with rings.\r\n\r\nA loudspeaker whistled tinnily and overhead, on wire runners, an\r\nelectric globe crossed the dim chamber, pieces of yellow and white\r\ncrepe paper fluttering feebly behind.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Pete! A comet?"\r\n\r\n"Sure enough, Glory," he said.\r\n\r\nThe rumbling little bullet skirted the walls and Pete could see the\r\nelectric lights behind the holes. Stars, he thought sardonically. Close\r\nenough to touch. Lucky us.\r\n\r\n"There\'s Mars, Pete," Glory said, squeezing his hand.\r\n\r\nI\'m getting disenchanted, he thought.\r\n\r\nA red ball, all painted with canals and white polar caps far too big.\r\n\r\nThey should have had a technical advisor on this project, he thought.\r\nPaging Palomar.\r\n\r\nThe bullet began its second circuit of the papier-m\xc3\xa2ch\xc3\xa9 universe,\r\nand the moon was high now, projected on the wall by some kind of\r\nlantern-slide lamp. There was a face on the moon.\r\n\r\nIt began then--just a tiny bead of fear way down inside his belly. But\r\nit grew. He felt suffocated, claustrophobic, oppressed by fakery and\r\ncheapness.\r\n\r\nGlory was laughing with delight. "Oh, it\'s wonderful!"\r\n\r\nShut up! 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Pete thought savagely. Shut up, _shut up_!\r\n\r\nWith an effort, he got hold of himself.\r\n\r\nI\'ve been working too hard. I\'m jittery thinking about the moonshot,\r\nand all this seedy burlesque just irritates me. There\'s nothing to get\r\nheated up about. Calm down.\r\n\r\nBut why am I suddenly afraid?\r\n\r\nHe looked again at the ridiculous moon with its smirking face. He saw\r\nthat plaster had fallen from the wall in places, peeling away, leaving\r\nthe bare hexagons of wire and laths.\r\n\r\nMy God, he thought. A chickenwire sky.\r\n\r\nHe thought again of the girl in the ticket booth, and of the tired,\r\nfrightened people all laughing too much and shoving and running outside.\r\n\r\nThe bullet started down at last, toward the hinged door. On this side\r\nit was painted to look like Earth, with a distorted map of North\r\nAmerica. All wrong, somehow.\r\n\r\nPete felt ill. It was as though someone were making ill-tempered fun\r\nof the dreams and the tall silver ship waiting out on the desert.\r\nCheapening it. Laughing nastily.\r\n\r\nThe little bullet bumped through the seedy, scruffy Earth and out\r\ninto the night of the midway, out into the crowd-sounds and music and\r\nhot-doggy smells.\r\n\r\n"It was fun, Pete," Glory said.\r\n\r\nHe helped her out onto the rickety platform. He had the insane notion\r\nthat the girl in the ticket booth and the lounging attendant were\r\nlaughing at him.\r\n\r\n"It sure was, honey," he said wearily, still feeling the illogical fear\r\nof he-knew-not-what inside himself. "Real fun."\r\n\r\nGlory looked up at him, eyes alight and almost feverishly gay. "I did\r\nwhat you are going to do. I touched the sky!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNew frontiers. New lands in the sky. New hope.\r\n\r\nIt was quiet. The jet was still and no sound was anywhere in the ship.\r\nNow a soft tick from the timer. A whisper from the questing radarscope.\r\nAnd again, the stillness.\r\n\r\nWe\'ve done it, Pete thought. We\'ve really done it. The hard part is\r\nover.\r\n\r\nRide the rocket!\r\n\r\nHe remembered the pain of the takeoff and the absolute panic that had\r\nwelled up in him when the irrevocability of his action came home. He\r\nremembered riding a tail of red fire up out of the hot desert air of\r\nNew Mexico into the still blue, and then the silence and the almost\r\nunnerving thrill of the realization that the moonshot was going to\r\nsucceed.\r\n\r\nThe radio hissed at him with the voice of the desert base half around\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n"Hello moonshot. This is Base. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
All\'s okay. Stage one landed in the\r\nGulf. Stage two just reported floating off the Azores. Good show."\r\n\r\nPete lifted himself from the acceleration couch and felt a moment of\r\nnausea and panic as he floated toward the ceiling of the tiny cell.\r\nFree flight. He steadied himself and checked the flow of telemetered\r\ninformation binding the ship to the glowing curve far below. All okay.\r\nExcept that--\r\n\r\nExcept that you\'re still afraid, he told himself. Not just the normal\r\nfear-of-falling-afraid that the psychs told you about. Afraid like\r\nbefore--in that silly damn carnival ride thing.\r\n\r\nAfraid of the dark?\r\n\r\nNo, not quite that. More a closed in, cheated feeling.\r\n\r\nPremonition? Nonsense.\r\n\r\nHe clung to the radarscope, trembling. With every rushing mile upward,\r\noutward, his fear was growing. It wasn\'t right, it didn\'t make sense.\r\nBut he felt as though he were rushing straight at a brick wall, head\r\ndown, eyes closed.\r\n\r\nHe lit the telescreens.\r\n\r\nThe stars look funny, he thought uneasily.\r\n\r\nThe timer ticked. The radar whispered, searching. Time passed and his\r\nfear grew thicker, less reasonable.\r\n\r\nHis fingers dug hard at the metal of the instrument panel as the night\r\nslipped by outside the hull. The ship\'s orbital ellipse, Kepler\'s\r\ncontribution to the new frontier, was established.\r\n\r\nPete thought, something\'s wrong. Very wrong. The stars look queer.\r\n\r\nThe constellations in the telescreens were distorting, and there\r\nwas something ahead of the ship where there should be nothing but\r\nemptiness. It showed in the screen for just an instant and was lost. A\r\nringed sphere.\r\n\r\nI must be dreaming, Pete thought. But then, what is reality? That\r\nsphere was Saturn. And it was a hundred yards across.\r\n\r\nReality? _Insanity!_\r\n\r\nI\'d better check with Base, Pete thought, and tell them I\'ve gone off\r\nmy rocker, that I\'m suffering hallucinations.\r\n\r\nBut he did nothing except cling shaking to the panel, watching the\r\ndistorted stars in the screen. They were blurring now, streaks of light\r\nthat seemed to be very close to the ship.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd then came the moon. It came and went very quickly, pocked and\r\nscarred and with only one face. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
And _small_. Very small and very close.\r\n\r\nPete felt closed in, suffocated. The radar alarm was screaming at him\r\nthat something was near, too near.\r\n\r\nHe clamped down savagely on himself. There was an explanation\r\nsomewhere. He had to find it! He had to think!\r\n\r\nItem. The stars. Distorted. Blurred.\r\n\r\nItem. Saturn. A hundred yards across.\r\n\r\nItem. A tiny replica of the moon, like a pimple on the inside of an egg.\r\n\r\nReplica? No. _The_ moon. The only moon. Reality.\r\n\r\nHypothesis. Say that space is not as men imagined it. Say that it is an\r\nillusion, without lightyears, without great suns, without huge planets.\r\nSay for the sake of argument that it is a shell with holes in it, and\r\nlight outside, and the Sun itself an illusion of heat and power, and--\r\n\r\nSay that this hollow shell is man\'s new frontier; a fraud, a toy for\r\nthings outside--\r\n\r\nThe alarm screamed at him. The ship was plunging toward the blurry\r\nlight of the stars.\r\n\r\nWith an icy hand on his heart, Pete Moore turned to look at the\r\ntelescreen behind him. A misty blue ball swam in musty darkness. The\r\noceans gleamed in the light of the sun, cloud masses whitened it, the\r\nwrinkled face of the land looked unreal--\r\n\r\nHe began to laugh. Tears streaked his cheeks as he pounded his bloody\r\nfists against the instrument panel in time to the clanging of the alarm.\r\n\r\nThe Earth, the Earth--\r\n\r\nIt _did_ rather look like papier-m\xc3\xa2ch\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\nHe touched the sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
