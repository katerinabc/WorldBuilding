]\r\n\r\n    _Only rarely will the_ Infinity-plus _symbol--INFINITY\'s award\r\n    of unusual merit--appear on an individual story. (For a typical\r\n    example of the way it will be used, see "Tales of Tomorrow"\r\n    elsewhere in this issue.)_ The Men Return _is an exception by\r\n    virtue of being one of the most unusual stories ever written. We do\r\n    not guarantee that you will like it, but we are sure that you will\r\n    either like it tremendously or hate it violently. And we\'re very\r\n    anxious to learn your reactions!_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Relict came furtively down the crag, a shambling gaunt creature\r\nwith tortured eyes. He moved in a series of quick dashes, using panels\r\nof dark air for concealment, running behind each passing shadow, at\r\ntimes crawling on all fours, head low to the ground. Arriving at the\r\nfinal low outcrop of rock, he halted and peered across the plain.\r\n\r\nFar away rose low hills, blurring into the sky, which was mottled and\r\nsallow like poor milk-glass. The intervening plain spread like rotten\r\nvelvet, black-green and wrinkled, streaked with ocher and rust. A\r\nfountain of liquid rock jetted high in the air, branched out into black\r\ncoral. In the middle distance a family of gray objects evolved with\r\na sense of purposeful destiny: spheres melted into pyramids, became\r\ndomes, tufts of white spires, sky-piercing poles; then, as a final\r\n_tour de force_, tesseracts.\r\n\r\nThe Relict cared nothing for this; he needed food and out on the plain\r\nwere plants. They would suffice in lieu of anything better. They\r\ngrew in the ground, or sometimes on a floating lump of water, or\r\nsurrounding a core of hard black gas. There were dank black flaps of\r\nleaf, clumps of haggard thorn, pale green bulbs, stalks with leaves\r\nand contorted flowers. There were no recognizable species, and the\r\nRelict had no means of knowing if the leaves and tendrils he had eaten\r\nyesterday would poison him today.\r\n\r\nHe tested the surface of the plain with his foot. The glassy surface\r\n(though it likewise seemed a construction of red and gray-green\r\npyramids) accepted his weight, then suddenly sucked at his leg. In a\r\nfrenzy he tore himself free, jumped back, squatted on the temporarily\r\nsolid rock.\r\n\r\nHunger rasped at his stomach. He must eat. He contemplated the plain.\r\nNot too far away a pair of Organisms played--sliding, diving, dancing,\r\nstriking flamboyant poses. Should they approach he would try to kill\r\none of them. They resembled men, and so should make a good meal.\r\n\r\nHe waited. A long time? 

=== Chunk 3 ===
A short time? It might have been either;\r\nduration had neither quantitative nor qualitative reality. The sun had\r\nvanished, and there was no standard cycle or recurrence. Time was a\r\nword blank of meaning.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMatters had not always been so. The Relict retained a few tattered\r\nrecollections of the old days, before system and logic had been\r\nrendered obsolete. Man had dominated Earth by virtue of a single\r\nassumption: that an effect could be traced to a cause, itself the\r\neffect of a previous cause.\r\n\r\nManipulation of this basic law yielded rich results; there seemed no\r\nneed for any other tool or instrumentality. Man congratulated himself\r\non his generalized structure. He could live on desert, on plain or\r\nice, in forest or in city; Nature had not shaped him to a special\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\nHe was unaware of his vulnerability. Logic was the special environment;\r\nthe brain was the special tool.\r\n\r\nThen came the terrible hour when Earth swam into a pocket of\r\nnon-causality, and all the ordered tensions of cause-effect dissolved.\r\nThe special tool was useless; it had no purchase on reality. From the\r\ntwo billions of men, only a few survived--the mad. They were now the\r\nOrganisms, lords of the era, their discords so exactly equivalent to\r\nthe vagaries of the land as to constitute a peculiar wild wisdom.\r\nOr perhaps the disorganized matter of the world, loose from the old\r\norganization, was peculiarly sensitive to psycho-kinesis.\r\n\r\nA handful of others, the Relicts, managed to exist, but only through a\r\ndelicate set of circumstances. They were the ones most strongly charged\r\nwith the old causal dynamic. It persisted sufficiently to control the\r\nmetabolism of their bodies, but could extend no further. They were fast\r\ndying out, for sanity provided no leverage against the environment.\r\nSometimes their own minds sputtered and jangled, and they would go\r\nraving and leaping out across the plain.\r\n\r\nThe Organisms observed with neither surprise nor curiosity; how could\r\nsurprise exist? The mad Relict might pause by an Organism, and try to\r\nduplicate the creature\'s existence. The Organism ate a mouthful of\r\nplant; so did the Relict. The Organism rubbed his feet with crushed\r\nwater; so did the Relict. Presently the Relict would die of poison\r\nor rent bowels or skin lesions, while the Organism relaxed in the\r\ndank black grass. Or the Organism might seek to eat the Relict; and\r\nthe Relict would run off in terror, unable to abide any part of the\r\nworld--running, bounding, breasting the thick air; eyes wide, mouth\r\nopen, calling and gasping until finally he floundered in a pool of\r\nblack iron or blundered into a vacuum pocket, to bat around like a fly\r\nin a bottle.\r\n\r\nThe Relicts now numbered very few. Finn, he who crouched on the rock\r\noverlooking the plain, lived with four others. Two of these were old\r\nmen and soon would die. Finn likewise would die unless he found food.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOut on the plain one of the Organisms, Alpha, sat down, caught\r\na handful of air, a globe of blue liquid, a rock, kneaded them\r\ntogether, pulled the mixture like taffy, gave it a great heave. It\r\nuncoiled from his hand like rope. The Relict crouched low. No telling\r\nwhat devilry would occur to the creature. He and all the rest of\r\nthem--unpredictable! The Relict valued their flesh as food; but they\r\nalso would eat him if opportunity offered. In the competition he was\r\nat a great disadvantage. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Their random acts baffled him. If, seeking\r\nto escape, he ran, the worst terror would begin. The direction he set\r\nhis face was seldom the direction the varying frictions of the ground\r\nlet him move. But the Organisms were as random and uncommitted as the\r\nenvironment, and the double set of vagaries sometimes compounded,\r\nsometimes canceled each other. In the latter case the Organisms might\r\ncatch him....\r\n\r\nIt was inexplicable. But then, what was not? The word "explanation" had\r\nno meaning.\r\n\r\nThey were moving toward him; had they seen him? He flattened himself\r\nagainst the sullen yellow rock.\r\n\r\nThe two Organisms paused not far away. He could hear their sounds, and\r\ncrouched, sick from conflicting pangs of hunger and fear.\r\n\r\nAlpha sank to his knees, lay flat on his back, arms and legs flung out\r\nat random, addressing the sky in a series of musical cries, sibilants,\r\nguttural groans. It was a personal language he had only now improvised,\r\nbut Beta understood him well.\r\n\r\n"A vision," cried Alpha, "I see past the sky. I see knots, spinning\r\ncircles. They tighten into hard points; they will never come undone."\r\n\r\nBeta perched on a pyramid, glanced over this shoulder at the mottled\r\nsky.\r\n\r\n"An intuition," chanted Alpha, "a picture out of the other time. It is\r\nhard, merciless, inflexible."\r\n\r\nBeta poised on the pyramid, dove through the glassy surface, swam under\r\nAlpha, emerged, lay flat beside him.\r\n\r\n"Observe the Relict on the hillside. In his blood is the whole of the\r\nold race--the narrow men with minds like cracks. He has exuded the\r\nintuition. Clumsy thing--a blunderer," said Alpha.\r\n\r\n"They are all dead, all of them," said Beta. "Although three or\r\nfour remain." (When _past_, _present_ and _future_ are no more than\r\nideas left over from another era, like boats on a dry lake--then the\r\ncompletion of a process can never be defined.)\r\n\r\nAlpha said, "This is the vision. I see the Relicts swarming the Earth;\r\nthen whisking off to nowhere, like gnats in the wind. This is behind\r\nus."\r\n\r\nThe Organisms lay quiet, considering the vision.\r\n\r\nA rock, or perhaps a meteor, fell from the sky, struck into the surface\r\nof the pond. It left a circular hole which slowly closed. From another\r\npart of the pool a gout of fluid splashed into the air, floated away.\r\n\r\nAlpha spoke: "Again--the intuition comes strong! There will be lights\r\nin the sky."\r\n\r\nThe fever died in him. He hooked a finger into the air, hoisted himself\r\nto his feet.\r\n\r\nBeta lay quiet. Slugs, ants, flies, beetles were crawling on him,\r\nboring, breeding. Alpha knew that Beta could arise, shake off the\r\ninsects, stride off. But Beta seemed to prefer passivity. That was well\r\nenough. He could produce another Beta should he choose, or a dozen\r\nof him. Sometimes the world swarmed with Organisms, all sorts, all\r\ncolors, tall as steeples, short and squat as flower-pots.\r\n\r\n"I feel a lack," said Alpha. "I will eat the Relict." He set forth, and\r\nsheer chance brought him near to the ledge of yellow rock. Finn the\r\nRelict sprang to his feet in panic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlpha tried to communicate, so that Finn might pause while Alpha ate.\r\nBut Finn had no grasp for the many-valued overtones of Alpha\'s voice.\r\nHe seized a rock, hurled it at Alpha. The rock puffed into a cloud of\r\ndust, blew back into the Relict\'s face.\r\n\r\nAlpha moved closer, extended his long arms. The Relict kicked. His feet\r\nwent out from under him, and he slid out on the plain. Alpha ambled\r\ncomplacently behind him. Finn began to crawl away. Alpha moved off to\r\nthe right--one direction was as good as another. He collided with Beta,\r\nand began to eat Beta instead of the Relict. The Relict hesitated; then\r\napproached and, joining Alpha, pushed chunks of pink flesh into his\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\nAlpha said to the Relict, "I was about to communicate an intuition to\r\nhim whom we dine upon. I will speak to you."\r\n\r\nFinn could not understand Alpha\'s personal language. He ate as rapidly\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\nAlpha spoke on. "There will be lights in the sky. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
The great lights."\r\n\r\nFinn rose to his feet and, warily watching Alpha, seized Beta\'s legs,\r\nbegan to pull him toward the hill. Alpha watched with quizzical\r\nunconcern.\r\n\r\nIt was hard work for the spindly Relict. Sometimes Beta floated;\r\nsometimes he wafted off on the air; sometimes he adhered to the\r\nterrain. At last he sank into a knob of granite which froze around him.\r\nFinn tried to jerk Beta loose, and then to pry him up with a stick,\r\nwithout success.\r\n\r\nHe ran back and forth in an agony of indecision. Beta began to\r\ncollapse, wither, like a jellyfish on hot sand. The Relict abandoned\r\nthe hulk. Too late, too late! 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Food going to waste! The world was a\r\nhideous place of frustration!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTemporarily his belly was full. He started back up the crag, and\r\npresently found the camp, where the four other Relicts waited--two\r\nancient males, two females. The females, Gisa and Reak, like Finn, had\r\nbeen out foraging. Gisa had brought in a slab of lichen; Reak a bit of\r\nnameless carrion.\r\n\r\nThe old men, Boad and Tagart, sat quietly waiting either for food or\r\nfor death.\r\n\r\nThe women greeted Finn sullenly. "Where is the food you went forth to\r\nfind?"\r\n\r\n"I had a whole carcass," said Finn. "I could not carry it."\r\n\r\nBoad had slyly stolen the slab of lichen and was cramming it into his\r\nmouth. It came alive, quivered and exuded a red ichor which was poison,\r\nand the old man died.\r\n\r\n"Now there is food," said Finn. "Let us eat."\r\n\r\nBut the poison created a putrescence; the body seethed with blue foam,\r\nflowed away of its own energy.\r\n\r\nThe women turned to look at the other old man, who said in a quavering\r\nvoice, "Eat me if you must--but why not choose Reak, who is younger\r\nthan I?"\r\n\r\nReak, the younger of the women, gnawing on the bit of carrion, made no\r\nreply.\r\n\r\nFinn said hollowly, "Why do we worry ourselves? Food is ever more\r\ndifficult, and we are the last of all men."\r\n\r\n"No, no," spoke Reak. "Not the last. We saw others on the green mound."\r\n\r\n"That was long ago," said Gisa. "Now they are surely dead."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps they have found a source of food," suggested Reak.\r\n\r\nFinn rose to his feet, looked across the plain. "Who knows? 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Perhaps\r\nthere is a more pleasant land beyond the horizon."\r\n\r\n"There is nothing anywhere but waste and evil creatures," snapped Gisa.\r\n\r\n"What could be worse than here?" Finn argued calmly.\r\n\r\nNo one could find grounds for disagreement.\r\n\r\n"Here is what I propose," said Finn. "Notice this tall peak. Notice\r\nthe layers of hard air. They bump into the peak, they bounce off, they\r\nfloat in and out and disappear past the edge of sight. Let us all\r\nclimb this peak, and when a sufficiently large bank of air passes, we\r\nwill throw ourselves on top, and allow it to carry us to the beautiful\r\nregions which may exist just out of sight."\r\n\r\nThere was argument. The old man Tagart protested his feebleness; the\r\nwomen derided the possibility of the bountiful regions Finn envisioned,\r\nbut presently, grumbling and arguing, they began to clamber up the\r\npinnacle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt took a long time; the obsidian was soft as jelly, and Tagart several\r\ntimes professed himself at the limit of his endurance. But still they\r\nclimbed, and at last reached the pinnacle. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
There was barely room to\r\nstand. They could see in all directions, far out over the landscape,\r\ntill vision was lost in the watery gray.\r\n\r\nThe women bickered and pointed in various directions, but there was\r\nsmall sign of happier territory. In one direction blue-green hills\r\nshivered like bladders full of oil. In another direction lay a\r\nstreak of black--a gorge or a lake of clay. In another direction were\r\nblue-green hills--the same they had seen in the first direction;\r\nsomehow there had been a shift. Below was the plain, gleaming like\r\nan iridescent beetle, here and there pocked with black velvet spots,\r\novergrown with questionable vegetation.\r\n\r\nThey saw Organisms, a dozen shapes loitering by ponds, munching\r\nvegetable pods or small rocks or insects. There came Alpha. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
He moved\r\nslowly, still awed by his vision, ignoring the other Organisms. Their\r\nplay went on, but presently they stood quiet, sharing the oppression.\r\n\r\nOn the obsidian peak, Finn caught hold of a passing filament of air,\r\ndrew it in. "Now--all on, and we sail away to the Land of Plenty."\r\n\r\n"No," protested Gisa, "there is no room, and who knows if it will fly\r\nin the right direction?"\r\n\r\n"Where is the right direction?" asked Finn. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
"Does anyone know?"\r\n\r\nNo one knew, but the women still refused to climb aboard the filament.\r\nFinn turned to Tagart. "Here, old one, show these women how it is;\r\nclimb on!

=== Chunk 11 ===
"\r\n\r\n"No, no," he cried. "I fear the air; this is not for me."\r\n\r\n"Climb on, old man, then we follow."\r\n\r\nWheezing and fearful, clenching his hands deep into the spongy mass,\r\nTagart pulled himself out onto the air, spindly shanks hanging over\r\ninto nothing. "Now," spoke Finn, "who next?"\r\n\r\nThe women still refused. "You go then, yourself," cried Gisa.\r\n\r\n"And leave you, my last guarantee against hunger? Aboard now!"\r\n\r\n"No. The air is too small; let the old one go and we will follow on a\r\nlarger."\r\n\r\n"Very well." Finn released his grip. The air floated off over the\r\nplain, Tagart straddling and clutching for dear life.\r\n\r\nThey watched him curiously. "Observe," said Finn, "how fast and easily\r\nmoves the air. Above the Organisms, over all the slime and uncertainty."\r\n\r\nBut the air itself was uncertain, and the old man\'s raft dissolved.\r\nClutching at the departing wisps, Tagart sought to hold his cushion\r\ntogether. It fled from under him, and he fell.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the peak the three watched the spindly shape flap and twist on its\r\nway to earth far below.\r\n\r\n"Now," Reak exclaimed vexatiously, "we even have no more meat."\r\n\r\n"None," said Gisa, "except the visionary Finn himself."\r\n\r\nThey surveyed Finn. Together they would more than outmatch him.\r\n\r\n"Careful," cried Finn. "I am the last of the Men. You are my women,\r\nsubject to my orders."\r\n\r\nThey ignored him, muttering to each other, looking at him from the side\r\nof their faces. "Careful!" cried Finn. "I will throw you both from this\r\npeak."\r\n\r\n"That is what we plan for you," said Gisa.\r\n\r\nThey advanced with sinister caution.\r\n\r\n"Stop! I am the last Man!"\r\n\r\n"We are better off without you."\r\n\r\n"One moment! Look at the Organisms!"\r\n\r\nThe women looked. The Organisms stood in a knot, staring at the sky.\r\n\r\n"Look at the sky!"\r\n\r\nThe women looked; the frosted glass was cracking, breaking, curling\r\naside.\r\n\r\n"The blue! The blue sky of old times!"\r\n\r\nA terribly bright light burnt down, seared their eyes. The rays warmed\r\ntheir naked backs.\r\n\r\n"The sun," they said in awed voices. "The sun has come back to Earth."\r\n\r\nThe shrouded sky was gone; the sun rode proud and bright in a sea of\r\nblue. The ground below churned, cracked, heaved, solidified. They felt\r\nthe obsidian harden under their feet; its color shifted to glossy\r\nblack. The Earth, the sun, the galaxy, had departed the region of\r\nfreedom; the other time with its restrictions and logic was once more\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\n"This is Old Earth," cried Finn. "We are Men of Old Earth! The land is\r\nonce again ours!"\r\n\r\n"And what of the Organisms?"\r\n\r\n"If this is the Earth of old, then let the Organisms beware!"\r\n\r\nThe Organisms stood on a low rise of ground beside a runnel of water\r\nthat was rapidly becoming a river flowing out onto the plain.\r\n\r\nAlpha cried, "Here is my intuition! It is exactly as I knew. The\r\nfreedom is gone; the tightness, the constriction are back!"\r\n\r\n"How will we defeat it?" asked another Organism.\r\n\r\n"Easily," said a third. "Each must fight a part of the battle. I\r\nplan to hurl myself at the sun, and blot it from existence." And he\r\ncrouched, threw himself into the air. He fell on his back and broke his\r\nneck.\r\n\r\n"The fault," said Alpha, "is in the air; because the air surrounds all\r\nthings."\r\n\r\nSix Organisms ran off in search of air and, stumbling into the river,\r\ndrowned.\r\n\r\n"In any event," said Alpha, "I am hungry." He looked around for\r\nsuitable food. He seized an insect which stung him. He dropped it. 

=== Chunk 12 ===
"My\r\nhunger remains."\r\n\r\nHe spied Finn and the two women descending from the crag. "I will eat\r\none of the Relicts," he said. "Come, let us all eat."\r\n\r\nThree of them started off--as usual in random directions. By chance\r\nAlpha came face to face with Finn. He prepared to eat, but Finn picked\r\nup a rock. The rock remained a rock, hard, sharp, heavy. Finn swung it\r\ndown, taking joy in the inertia. Alpha died with a crushed skull. One\r\nof the other Organisms attempted to step across a crevasse twenty feet\r\nwide and disappeared into it; the other sat down, swallowed rocks to\r\nassuage his hunger, and presently went into convulsions.\r\n\r\nFinn pointed here and there around the fresh new land. "In that\r\nquarter, the new city, like that of the legends. 

=== Chunk 13 ===
Over here the farms,\r\nthe cattle."\r\n\r\n"We have none of these," protested Gisa.\r\n\r\n"No," said Finn. "Not now. But once more the sun rises and sets, once\r\nmore rock has weight and air has none. Once more water falls as rain\r\nand flows to the sea." He stepped forward over the fallen Organism.\r\n"Let us make plans."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
