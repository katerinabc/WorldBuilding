But he\'d washed out of\r\n        the Academy while his friends went on to greatness--and\r\n             to death. He\'d missed the boat at every turn.\r\n           But now there were no turns left, with raw space\r\n         around him and death waiting on a lonely asteroid....\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n                      Rocket Stories, July 1953.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nJubil drifted slowly, alone except for the phosphorescent star shine\r\nthat filtered through the face-plate of his suit. He was resting,\r\nconserving the oxygen that hissed steadily and quietly through the\r\nvalve near his neck. It was time for peace; there had been too much\r\nviolence already.\r\n\r\nOnce, as his body continued its involuntary and aimless turning, Jubil\r\nsaw the dark hull of the _Mercury II_, the outer access door firmly\r\nclosed now and the stern beginning to fluoresce with the secondary\r\nradiation that betokened the firing of the drives. Still, Jubil could\r\nfeel no anger at Radik.\r\n\r\nWhen the crew had conspired to mutiny, when Radik, Olgan and the rest\r\nhad decided to take over the operation of the _Mercury II_, at that\r\ntime had been the need for honest anger. Jubil had hesitated weakly\r\ninstead, had chosen to be a bystander and had suffered the fate of the\r\naverage non-participant; he had been outcast from the closed circle\r\nof both friend and enemy. Kane, once Captain of the _Mercury II_, was\r\nnow dead and his _dis_-charred body drifting somewhere in the spatial\r\nwilderness.\r\n\r\n"Have you changed your thinking, Jubil?" It was Radik\'s voice in the\r\nhelmet phones and Jubil could almost see the heavy face with its\r\nfringe of space-black beard. Jubil rested, listening to the cosmic\r\ninterference in his R-link equipment.\r\n\r\n"Jubil! Jubil Marken! Have you changed your mind?"\r\n\r\n"Radik--" Jubil formed the words slowly, using his lips only and\r\nbreathing shallowly. "Piracy suits you, Radik. You are one of the\r\nruthless...."\r\n\r\nJubil could hear Radik\'s throaty chuckle. "A dead man of honor is still\r\ndead, Jubil." The communication circuit went silent except for the buzz\r\nof voices in the background. Jubil drifted on, conscious of the fact\r\nthat he was moving but so full of the lethargy of the moment that he\r\nneglected it. What would it be like, this bit of time that was left? It\r\nhad been an hour since Jubil had been forcibly ejected from the access\r\ndoor of the _Mercury II_; the flask at his back carried oxygen for\r\nfour. Three hours of life--while around his slowly turning body was the\r\nagelessness of endless space. Jubil smiled, just a little, conscious\r\nof the fact that he felt no fear. The die was cast now; he had made his\r\ndecision finally, and he did not regret it.\r\n\r\n"There is space-craft in Sector 180, Jubil," it was Radik again, "Racon\r\nhas just reported it. But they\'ll miss you by at least ten parsecs.\r\nHave you changed your mind?"\r\n\r\n"No.

"\r\n\r\n"Very well." 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Jubil could see the pulsing of the _Mercury\'s_ drives,\r\nnow. Radik was taking no chances on the strange ship still light years\r\naway from his stern being patrol. "Good news for you, Jubil. You are\r\nin the gravitational field of an asteroid. You can\'t see it, yet; it\'s\r\ndirectly above you. But you\'ll drift to it and cling like a snail on a\r\nstone for as long as time itself. Good-bye, Jubil."\r\n\r\nStrange, Jubil thought, that there was no anger in him now. There\r\nshould be oxygen enough for a good two hours yet, so this eerie ennui\r\ncould not be the prelude to a rising carbon dioxide quotient. A normal\r\nman would be bitter, perhaps even hysterical in his anger and his\r\nfear of death. Yet there was only this peaceful drifting toward the\r\nstill-invisible asteroid that hung in space above his own head. Jubil\r\nclosed his eyes, shutting out the phosphorescence of the velvet that\r\nwas space. The exhaust of the _Mercury II_ might still be in sight.\r\nIf so, it was not visible through the restriction of the plastic\r\nface-plate of Jubil\'s suit.\r\n\r\nJubil found himself wondering where Kane could have drifted since the\r\ncaptain\'s inert body had been shoved out of the _Mercury II\'s_ access\r\ndoor. Perhaps, even now, it was bound, like a rudderless ship, toward\r\nthe selfsame asteroid that would be Jubil\'s last and permanent home.\r\n\r\nThinking of Kane, Jubil remembered also Schoenbirk, the erratic\r\ngenius whose mathematical theorizing was used in the design of the\r\nSchoenbirk-Halsted De-Fouling Gear. Had it been years, or lifetimes\r\nago, when the three of them had been undergraduates together at the\r\nAcademy?\r\n\r\nSchoenbirk, working with the high electrostatic potentials necessary\r\nto insure the exhaust of opposite-sign waste from the complex guts of\r\nthe atomic drive had been blown to pieces by the accumulation of the\r\nvery thing his device was designed to prevent. Random electrical forces\r\ngathering around the discharge ring until their workable mass became\r\ngreat enough to enter and initiate a chain reaction in the fuel storage\r\ntank. Along with Schoenbirk had gone even the tremendously heavy\r\nconcrete walls of the laboratory. All that, however, had been after\r\nJubil had washed out of the Academy and gone into the space-freighters\r\nas a Drive-Engineer. In the intervening years, Jubil had become\r\nthoroughly familiar with the perfected Schoenbirk-Halsted....\r\n\r\nKane! There was a man who had made the Academy his own playground.\r\nKane had passed with the greatest of ease, worked his way through\r\nastro-navigation, the Allen Drives, space-time computations....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJubil grimaced wryly. It had been the latter with its advanced\r\nmathematics that had been his own downfall. So Kane had gone on to the\r\nfirst officer berth in a gilded passenger liner while Jubil developed\r\nradiation scars on his hands from "in the hole" engineering on decrepit\r\nfreighters.\r\n\r\nAnd the great leveller had met and conquered them all....\r\n\r\nSchoenbirk, even in the explosion that took his life had accomplished\r\na great thing: the discovery of the final flaw in the De-Fouling\r\nGear that had lived after him. For without proper removal of the\r\nionized waste from its drive engines, the largest freighter became an\r\never-accumulating and treacherously unstable fissionable pile.\r\n\r\nKane--one of the legendary figures of the history of astro-navigation.\r\nKane with his Academy background and his proud but personable air had\r\nbecome one of the most talked-of Space captains who had ever lived.\r\nJubil could still, in memory, see Kane, standing spread-kneed on the\r\nbridge of the _Comet_, one of the first; later the _Wanderer_, the\r\nfirst of the luxury space liners. The _Mercury_, and the _Mercury II_,\r\nthe super-ships that made week-end excursion flights that spanned from\r\ngalaxy to galaxy.\r\n\r\nA misplaced decimal point and a misplaced trust and the greatness\r\nof Schoenbirk and Kane lay behind them. Even as his drifting body,\r\ncumbersome in the space-suit, touched the asteroid, Jubil was aware of\r\na strange weariness that invaded every part of him except his mind. At\r\nleast, the waning oxygen would leave him his thoughts.\r\n\r\nHe rested, conserving his strength. For what reason? 

=== Chunk 4 ===
The thing that was\r\nto happen was as certain as Fate and as unavoidable by the machinations\r\nof man. Was it, after all, because Jubil was prey to anger? No. He was\r\nnow too near death for anger to seem important.\r\n\r\nThe face of the asteroid was cold and Jubil lay against it, held as\r\nlightly as a maiden\'s kiss by the ounce or so of gravity.\r\n\r\nHe was smiling as the darkness of space was suddenly brilliantly\r\nlighted. Spears of bluish flame, each with its tip of crimson, spread\r\nacross the warp of time, and subconsciously Jubil found himself waiting\r\nfor the shock wave. Then he laughed. In space there was no atmosphere;\r\nhe would never be buffeted by the blast that had destroyed the _Mercury\r\nII_ and the mutineer Radik.\r\n\r\nJubil thought again of the hellish radiation to which he had exposed\r\nhimself. There was no other way. To destroy the delicate regulating\r\nlinkage of the Schoenbirk-Halsted, a man must enter the combustion\r\nchamber where the pilot-piles idled. There had been just time enough\r\nfor that, before Radik had sent for him.\r\n\r\nHad there been ample oxygen, Jubil Marken knew that he would only have\r\nlived until his radiation-seared heart painfully failed to function.\r\nBut, thanks to Radik, Jubil had been spared both the disintegration of\r\nthe _Mercury II_ and an agonizing death from slow radiation burn.\r\n\r\nHe was, Jubil reflected, as effective in his own way as was Schoenbirk\r\nand Kane. In the end, he was still an Academy man with them.

He\r\nwas peacefully smiling as he twisted tight the oxygen valve at his\r\nthroat....\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
