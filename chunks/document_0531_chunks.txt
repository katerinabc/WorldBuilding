But they combined when he met--\r\n\r\n                         The Incredible Aliens\r\n\r\n                        By William Bender, Jr.\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Imagination Stories of Science and Fantasy\r\n                               July 1954\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was only a tiny dot on the view screen when the military lookout\r\non the armed cruiser identified it as an alien spaceship and sounded\r\nthe general alert. Technicist Ninth Class Narant, chief psychanalyst\r\naboard, studied its approach with a rebellious, almost passionate hope\r\nthat the impossible was at last going to happen.\r\n\r\nOr was it impossible? They were the first men to visit this planetary\r\nsystem. Why couldn\'t they expect to encounter a truly superior race for\r\na change?\r\n\r\nIntently, Narant examined the course of the alien craft. Rather\r\nmischievously he hoped the stranger would suddenly adopt evasion\r\ntactics showing it had detected their presence in the black void\r\nbetween the 6th and 7th planets of the Star Restus. That would\r\ncertainly be a sign of superiority! And what a blow to Central\r\nScientific Headquarters back home. The anti-detection shield was one of\r\ntheir proudest accomplishments.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, though still wishful, Narant realized deep in his heart that\r\nsuch hopes were blighted. Illogical and improbable. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
No people in the\r\nUniverse could even compare with them. Explorers and merchants and\r\nmilitary ships and privateers had prowled all the great planetary\r\nsystems of the galaxy. They and their technology reigned supreme\r\neverywhere. Indeed, the accumulated evidence of their supremacy even\r\nformed the irrefutable foundation of Central Scientific\'s dogma on\r\nselective breeding.\r\n\r\n"I must ask you to leave the bridge now, doctor." The voice, crisp and\r\nauthoritative, crackled over Narant\'s shoulder.\r\n\r\nCommander Karsine had entered the control room during Narant\'s brief\r\nreverie in front of the viewing screen. An able and successful combat\r\nofficer still in his early thirties, Karsine wore the light weight\r\nspace armor the regulations prescribed for moments of impending action.\r\nEven if the enemy blasted a hole in the control room itself, that armor\r\ncould protect Karsine long enough to save or disintegrate the cruiser,\r\nas the case might be.\r\n\r\n"Commander," Narant suddenly blurted. "One request. I should like to\r\nremain this one time and observe your tactics right here."\r\n\r\n"Denied." Karsine explained brusquely that only combat personnel were\r\nallowed in the central control room during contact with a strange\r\nvessel. "But," he ended, patronizingly, "you can watch from the\r\nobservation room. When we have made the capture, I\'ll be happy to\r\nreview my operations with you."\r\n\r\n_When_ we have made the capture. The Commander\'s abundant self\r\nconfidence only served to further depress Narant. Out there in the\r\nvoid rode a space vessel of an altogether unknown race. And there was\r\nno question in Karsine\'s mind but that their cruiser would take the\r\nalien. Not "_if_" we make the capture. Simply, "_when_." It was small\r\nsolace for Narant to recall that he himself had firmly established\r\nSelf Confidence as one of the highest-rated mental traits for military\r\ncommand. It had been one of his major projects as a Psychanalyst 4th\r\nClass.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs he left the bridge, the airlock rumbled shut behind him, sealing\r\noff the control room from the rest of the ship. Narant climbed the\r\nspiral staircase into the observation room. One entire wall was a thick\r\nquartzite pane over-looking the control center. You could see as much\r\nfrom up here as down below. But somehow it wasn\'t the same.\r\n\r\nOther technicists with non-combatant specialties were already strapped\r\nto seats in the room, prepared to watch the show on which their very\r\nlives might depend. The "VM" lamp winked slowly on and off, its orange\r\nglow warning against "possible violent maneuvers." Narant found a seat\r\nand obediently fastened the safety harness. He studied the view screen\r\non the bridge below. The alien ship, seemingly unaware of the danger\r\nthat now threatened it, still followed its initial course.\r\n\r\nNarant tried to concentrate on the scrambling activity in the control\r\ncenter, but his rebellious mind would have none of it. Unwanted\r\nmemories rose up to haunt him. He had been assigned to this trip\r\nmainly to purge those thoughts from his mind with work and action, but\r\nthe cure appeared no cure at all.\r\n\r\nThree months ago his final request for the marriage permit had returned\r\ndisapproved. The accompanying explanation had been a masterpiece\r\nof scientific doggerel. It analyzed the genetic composition of\r\nNarant and Technicist 3rd Class Melda. It presented carefully\r\nworked-out Tables of Probability regarding the nature and potential\r\nachievement of the offspring of such a union. It called attention\r\nto the low probability rate of Melda and Narant begetting a genius.\r\n"Therefore," it had concluded, "it is not in the best interests of the\r\nintended participants, nor will it serve to build the race, if the\r\naforementioned are joined in matrimony."\r\n\r\nThere followed a rare bit of sterilized philosophy: "It is to be hoped\r\nthat each party mentioned in the above will readily find another\r\nindividual in whom to repose his and her natural emotional interest."\r\nNarant felt, with a startling sense of the primeval, that if he should\r\nfind the person who phrased that report he would delightfully club him\r\nto death.\r\n\r\nBut of course emotionalism was absurd. The whole thing had been\r\nhandled dispassionately. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Certain basic factors had been fed into banks\r\nof electronic calculators and, a few micro-seconds later, the resultant\r\nstatistical data came out. It simply failed to measure up. There was\r\nno arguing or quibbling about the results for the calculators were\r\nmechanically infallible.\r\n\r\nHowever, Narant had taken one more step: an application for "random\r\nmating." But the retention drums of the master calculators had\r\naccumulated a far too overwhelming amount of information about the\r\nadvantages of scientific breeding. So that application, too, had been\r\nrefused.\r\n\r\nAnd shortly after, Narant found himself assigned to this cruiser bound\r\nfor Restus. A report that the inhabitants had begun space flight. A\r\ndistant, but conceivable threat to the security of the home planet. He\r\nknew the assignment resulted from some scientific effort to mollify his\r\ndisappointment. So he left home. But he took with him the forlorn hope\r\nthat on this voyage, or the next, or the one after that, he would find\r\nsomewhere in the vast reaches of space an advanced people who still\r\npracticed random mating; that he might find them, analyze them and feed\r\nthat information back to the master calculators. For only by placing\r\nhard new facts into the "brain" could there be any chance of changing\r\nthe decision.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the sealed combat control center, Commander Karsine finished\r\nstrapping himself into the anthropometric chair in front of the view\r\nscreen. A subordinate lowered the master control panel into position.\r\nNarant perked up with new interest. A specialist of Karsine\'s class, he\r\nrealized, could manipulate that control panel with the consummate skill\r\nof a master musician at a great organ. The battery of keys, buttons and\r\nswitches built into the panel gave Karsine complete domination over the\r\nthousands of small engines and servo-mechanisms, tens-of-thousands of\r\nelectric tubes, and the millions of electrical synapses that comprised\r\nthe fighting apparatus of the space cruiser.\r\n\r\nAbruptly the "VM" sign began flashing more rapidly, its color changing\r\nfrom orange to red. A siren whooped throughout the ship. Karsine\'s\r\nvoice, somewhat metallic over the speakers, gave the "Imminent Combat"\r\nalert. The ship was going into action.\r\n\r\nNarant felt the seat straps pull at his chest. In the view screen\r\nbelow, the alien vessel began to swell rapidly. A low hum permeated\r\nthe observation room. Narant glanced out the nearest port. Glistening\r\nmetallic spines were expanding outward from the body of the cruiser.\r\nAt the tip of each bulged the glowing cone of the force and detection\r\nheads, the cruiser\'s most potent tools of attack and defense.\r\n\r\n"Engine room!" Karsine\'s peremptory voice snapped through the speakers.\r\n\r\n"Engine room standing by."\r\n\r\n"For ten seconds only, do not ... repeat, do _not_ act on manual signal\r\ncontrol. This is a test only. Read them off."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir. Reading test signals: Fire eight ... fire six ... fire\r\nnine ... fire one ... fire main." The voice paused. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
"Is that all, sir?"\r\n\r\n"The ten seconds are up," reproached Karsine. Henceforth, his every\r\ncommand would have to be acted upon instantly. "Divert seventy per cent\r\nof main power supply into armament system."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"Check spinal extension."\r\n\r\n"Extended and locked. All force heads burning, Commander." Another\r\nvoice had answered this time.\r\n\r\n"Good." Karsine\'s brief acknowledgment for an efficient crew. "Activate\r\nthe combat calculator."\r\n\r\n"In action, sir."\r\n\r\nThere, Narant realized, was another de-humanizing achievement of\r\nCentral Scientific. Years ago in the war with the repulsive exoskeletal\r\ninhabitants of Sirius 13, earth\'s military commanders had gone into\r\nbattle with terrible ardor. To destroy the Sirians they had taken\r\nfrequent, unnecessary risks, and in so doing had sacrificed dozens\r\nof brand new combat ships. So a special calculator had been designed\r\nfor all craft except humble merchantmen. It kept a running check on\r\nthe enemy\'s tactics, his power output, his course, speed and relative\r\naggressiveness; it measured the power consumption of its own ship\r\nin counteracting enemy weapons, and a score of other factors. Once\r\nactivated, the "brain" computed the mathematical probabilities of\r\nultimate success at each instant of the battle. If the scale ever\r\ntipped in favor of the enemy craft, the calculator instantly selected\r\nthe best evasion course, fired auxiliary rockets and broke off the\r\nengagement.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNarant unconsciously shook his head in disapproval. He wondered if he\r\nwas getting old? Such efficiency disturbed him more than he cared to\r\nadmit. Only in the histories, it seemed, could you find those thrilling\r\nbattles where human ingenuity played the decisive role. Where a handful\r\nof courageous men could face outrageous odds and win through to victory\r\nby wit and resourcefulness. Yes, only in the histories.\r\n\r\nNowadays warfare, like love, revolved about mathematics and probability\r\ncurves and trillions of electrons chasing themselves through a maze of\r\nwires and throwing switches and making decisions that once had been the\r\nprerogative of man alone.\r\n\r\nNarant yearned for man\'s lost freedom to make an honest error.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Karsine\'s harsh voice came blasting over the loudspeaker.\r\n"Prepare to grapple!"\r\n\r\nNarant glanced quickly out through the port into the black sky. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
The\r\nalien ship, its bright metal reflecting the light of the distant sun,\r\nfloated a mile away. Motionless. Or so it seemed against the unchanging\r\nstellar background.\r\n\r\nIt possessed hard sleek lines, pointed nose, flaring tail vanes. Its\r\ndesigners, he guessed, must still be thinking in terms of atmospheric\r\nflight. It hardly seemed the type of craft that could cross the broad\r\ninterstellar reaches; probably had been built simply to plod about its\r\nneighboring planets. It must be an early development, for spaceships\r\nhad never before been detected in the Restus system. More than likely\r\nthe ship had not even become aware of their presence. Small wonder\r\nKarsine had decided to grapple.\r\n\r\nThe force heads on Narant\'s side of the cruiser began to shimmer under\r\nthe surge of power being fed to them. They grew red hot, almost\r\ntranslucent. They would hold fire until the beam became powerful enough\r\nto withstand tremendous forces. Sometimes in grappling, an enemy craft\r\nhad been known to discharge its main rocket batteries in an effort to\r\nwrench loose. But any second now....\r\n\r\n"Execute grapple!" Karsine ordered.\r\n\r\nThe cruiser shuddered. Lights dimmed as the force heads sucked at every\r\navailable bit of power. With a blinding flash, a blue-white ribbon of\r\nenergy streaked across the mile-wide void to the alien ship. It flicked\r\nthe nose of the Restus craft, gripped, and swept over the entire hull\r\nlike a glittering cocoon.\r\n\r\n"Tension indicator: Nine-eight-point-eight," reported a too-casual\r\nvoice over the speaker. "Enemy ship secured."\r\n\r\n"Opposing force?"\r\n\r\n"Negative."\r\n\r\nKarsine cautiously studied his dials, alert for the first sign of\r\na counter-blow. Nothing happened. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
A minute dragged by. The tension\r\nindicators remained constant; detection heads, zero. And then: "Bring\r\nit alongside."\r\n\r\nThe grappling beam slowly began to contract, bringing the alien ship\r\ncloser. As it passed through the invisibility screen, multi-colored\r\nde-action rays focussed upon it, nullifying virtually every weapon\r\nknown to man.\r\n\r\nNarant\'s hopes dissolved. The emptiness left only an aching futility.\r\nAs usual, the capture had been simple ... and complete.\r\n\r\n"Advance parties prepare to go aboard," commanded the loudspeaker.\r\n\r\nA man behind Narant unbuckled his straps, got up and stretched. "Here\r\nwe go again," he said. And then, to nobody in particular: "I used to\r\nget a kick out of investigating strange creatures. Now it\'s work. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Just\r\nwork."\r\n\r\nNarant looked over his shoulder at the cruiser\'s anthropometrist. He\r\nwould have to board the ship right behind the combat team, analyze\r\nthe tools, controls, living conditions of the crew. Perhaps he, too,\r\nexperienced this ennui of persistent success?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNarant had ended his preparations in the psych-examination chamber by\r\nthe time they brought the first of the alien people to him. Narant\r\nstared in sudden amazement. The creature was humanoid. It had a\r\nwell-formed head with a squat, shrunken nose and steep brows; there\r\nwere prehensile arms, and hands with five fingers. But the man was\r\nhairy and, Narant winced, immodestly naked.\r\n\r\nThe humanoid was still in the grip of the paralytic when they took him\r\ninto the examination chamber and strapped him to the table. Narant\r\njudged the alien a little taller, give or take a few inches, than a\r\nnormal human being. His interest began to perk up. It always did when\r\nhe could study another creature that had learned to conquer space.\r\nFor perhaps the first time in three months, thoughts of Melda were\r\nover-shadowed by the immediate prospect of exploring the mysteries of\r\nan alien mind.\r\n\r\nAs the attendant came back out of the chamber, Narant secured the door.\r\n"How many of them?" he asked.\r\n\r\nThe attendant shook his head in evident amazement. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
"Four. I don\'t know\r\nhow they do it, but that ship had only a four man crew."\r\n\r\n"Impossible," Narant exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"That\'s all there are," the man insisted. "We\'ve covered the whole\r\nship."\r\n\r\n"But how could they...?"\r\n\r\n"The engineers are working on that now. I heard one of them remark\r\nabout the great number of automatic controls, but even so ... isn\'t\r\nthat one for the book?"\r\n\r\nThat, Narant agreed, was one for the book. Four men. The space vessels\r\nhe knew usually held scores of crewmen and specialists to handle the\r\nmanifold emergencies that arose in flight. His imagination soaring,\r\nNarant turned rapidly to begin his experiments.\r\n\r\nHe started the automatic recorder that would code his findings on\r\na thin strip of tape and then, more excited than usual, began the\r\nexamination. Inside the chamber, a giant multi-faceted crystal began to\r\nrotate slowly in the gimbals which held it suspended from the ceiling.\r\nSharp individual beams of light swept over the face of the alien being\r\non the table. One by one, the lights flickered over him and passed on,\r\neach one probing, measuring, comparing with universal norms, and then\r\nrecording its findings on both dial and tape.\r\n\r\nLong before the five-hour examination was over, the hopes of\r\nTechnicist 9th Class Narant far transcended any he had experienced in\r\nthe past three months. The aliens had almost human potential. They\r\nwere fun-loving, kindly, clannish. Their resourcefulness _and their\r\ningenuity_ were literally unsurpassed.\r\n\r\nBut then the most amazing fact of all revealed itself: The time-lapse\r\nsince this race had been entirely primitive was fantastically short.\r\nIn one brief--almost abrupt--transition, they had gone from jungle to\r\nthe conquest of space. The mind, the racial background and the obvious\r\nachievements of these creatures presented such a picture of rapid\r\nadvancement as to stagger the imagination.\r\n\r\nOnce he had transmitted the coded tapes to Central Scientific, Narant\r\nsought out the anthropometrist. His lingering doubts vanished when\r\nthe two compared findings. Everything inside the spaceship had been\r\ndesigned expressly for these strange creatures with the five fingers\r\nand the prehensile hands and arms.\r\n\r\nAs the cruiser finally pointed toward home, Narant was a new man. Of\r\ncourse their information would set the scientific world spinning on\r\nits collective ear. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
But more important, it would have vast personal\r\nsignificance. According to the crystal, the mating pattern of these\r\nsurprisingly progressive beings was entirely one of random selection!\r\n\r\nAlready that data would be digesting inside the master calculators.\r\nThe knowledge would become a part of all future decisions. Probability\r\nrates would change strikingly ... especially those that governed the\r\nissuance of "random-mating" licenses. For Narant, the voyage had been a\r\ntremendous success.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHowever, in the space experimental laboratories near the Nevada desert\r\non the third planet of the sun Restus, no such optimism existed.\r\n\r\nTwenty-four hours had passed since the S-X-2 had vanished. They had\r\nhad a precise fix on it as it blistered through the void on an elliptic\r\ncourse that would return it automatically to Earth. Everything had\r\nseemed to be going perfectly. All the bugs of the first Spacerocket\r\nExperimental had evidentally been straightened out in making the "2".\r\nAnd then, some 250-thousand miles beyond Saturn, it had disappeared.\r\nJust like that.\r\n\r\nDr. Gordon Basset glanced distastefully at the telephone on his desk.\r\nThen he began thumbing through the metropolitan directory for a number.\r\nThe hands that held the directory were strong, supple. They would have\r\nbeen a revelation to Technicist Ninth Class Narant, if he had seen them.\r\n\r\nBut then Technicist Ninth Class Narant himself would have been\r\nsomething of a revelation to Dr. Gordon Basset, what with his twenty\r\nclaw-like extensors.\r\n\r\nBasset found the number, dialed, and waited for the connection.\r\n\r\n"Hello, Dr. Farrell? 

=== Chunk 10 ===
Basset here. I\'ve got bad news on the S-X-2.... No\r\ndetails yet, but the ship has broken contact.... Yes, I must presume\r\nit\'s lost.... I\'ll file a complete report as soon as possible....\r\nWhat\'s that?... I suppose you\'re right--we\'ll have the S.P.C.A. on our\r\nnecks for sacrificing four more test animals. What the hell, they\r\ncan\'t expect us to send men on these experimental flights!"\r\n\r\nBasset talked for a moment longer and then replaced the phone. He\r\nsighed. Another report. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
Another failure. Another requiem to be written\r\nfor a lost ship--and four chimpanzees.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
