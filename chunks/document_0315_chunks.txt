F. W.\r\n\r\nBy G. L. VANDENBURG\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              _There\'s nothing like a parade, I always\r\n                  say. Of course, I\'m a Martian._\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
Cruthers was a busy man. Coordinating the biggest parade in New\r\nYork\'s history is not easy. He was maneuvering his two hundred pounds\r\naround Washington Square with the agility of a quarterback. He had his\r\nhands full organizing marchers, locating floats, placing the many brass\r\nbands in their proper order and barking commands to assistants. But Mr.\r\nCruthers approached the job with all the zeal of an evangelist at a\r\nrevival meeting.\r\n\r\nAs he approached the south-west corner of the square he saw something\r\nthat jarred his already frayed nerves. He stopped abruptly. The mass of\r\nclipboards and papers he was carrying fell to the street. There before\r\nhim were one hundred and fifty ants, each of them at least six feet\r\ntall. His first impulse was to turn and run for the nearest doctor. He\r\nwas certain that the strain of his job was proving too much for him. But\r\none of the ants approached him. It seemed friendly enough, so Mr.\r\nCruthers stood his ground.\r\n\r\n"My group is waiting for their assignment." The ant\'s voice seemed to be\r\ncoming from the very core of its thorax which was a violent red.\r\n\r\n"Good Lord!" Mr. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Cruthers\' mouth opened up as wide as an oven door.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Cruthers, I believe the parade is about to start and my group--"\r\n\r\nMr. Cruthers managed to blurt out. "What the devil _are_ you anyway!"\r\n\r\n"This _is_ the parade marking the International Geophysical Year, is it\r\nnot?" The ant had a pleasant, friendly voice.\r\n\r\n"Well, yes, but--"\r\n\r\n"And you are Mr. Cruthers, the manager of the parade, is that not\r\ncorrect?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Cruthers rubbed his eyes and took another look at the strange\r\ncreature. Its head was a brilliant yellow. It had two large goggle eyes\r\nwhich rolled like itinerant marbles when it spoke. The low slung abdomen\r\nwas a burnt brown. It was bad enough, Cruthers thought, that these ants\r\nwere six feet tall, but it was nightmarish to see them in three colors.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Cruthers," the ant continued, "haven\'t you been instructed by the\r\nNational Academy of Sciences that the Martian V.F.W. is to participate\r\nin this parade?"\r\n\r\n"The Martian--!!" 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Mr. Cruthers\' mouth was open again. Then he realized\r\nthat when the ant spoke its mouth didn\'t move. He picked up his\r\nclipboard and papers from the street. His voice was hostile now. "What\r\nthe hell is this, some kind of a gag! What are you trying to do, scare a\r\nman half to death!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, we\'re not joking, Mr. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Cruthers. The National Academy--"\r\n\r\n"They didn\'t say anything to me about a bunch of clowns dressed up like\r\nants!" Mr. Cruthers\' indignation became intensified. He was loathe to\r\nadmit that he\'d been taken in by such obviously animated costumes. "Now\r\nlook here, I\'m a very busy man."\r\n\r\n"The arrangements _have_ been made, Mr. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Cruthers. If my group is refused\r\na place in this parade we shall file suit immediately. As manager you\'ll\r\nbe named co-defendant." The ant was gentle but firm.\r\n\r\nThe thought of being sued softened Mr. Cruthers\' attitude. "Well, I\'m\r\nvery sorry, pal, but every contingent in this parade is listed on my\r\nclipboard and you\'re not. I know this list by heart. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
What did you say\r\nthe name of your group was?"\r\n\r\n"The Martian V.F.W."\r\n\r\nMr. Cruthers was amused. "Those sure are the craziest outfits I\'ve ever\r\nseen," he chuckled. "Where\'d you get them? Walt Disney make them for\r\nyou?" He followed his own little joke with a long throaty laugh.\r\n\r\nThe ant was impatient. "About the parade, Mr. Cruthers, there isn\'t much\r\ntime."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, the parade. Well, let me see," he thumbed through the\r\nclipboard, "I guess there\'s always room for a few laughs. How many in\r\nyour group?"\r\n\r\n"One hundred and fifty. And we also have a float with us. Not a very\r\nlarge one. It measures twenty by twenty."\r\n\r\n"Tell you what. You move your group to the corner of Thompson Street and\r\nThird Street. Get behind the Tiffany float and follow them, okay?"\r\n\r\nThe ant paused a moment to record the instructions in his mind. Then he\r\nturned to leave.\r\n\r\n"Oh, wait a minute," Mr. Cruthers cried before the ant could rejoin his\r\ngroup. "Just who did you speak to at the National Academy of Sciences?"\r\n\r\n"I believe it was a Mr. Canfield."\r\n\r\nMr. Cruthers\' face lit up. "Well, why didn\'t you say so in the first\r\nplace! I\'d have placed you right away."\r\n\r\n"That\'s perfectly all right, Mr. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
Cruthers."\r\n\r\n"Listen, I don\'t know what you guys do but those costumes should\r\ncertainly bring the house down. There\'s going to be four million people\r\nwatching this parade. I bet that\'s the biggest audience you\'ve ever\r\nseen."\r\n\r\n"It certainly is." With that the ant strode away.\r\n\r\n"Good luck!" Mr. Cruthers shouted after him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Daddy! Daddy, look! Look at the big rocket!" The little boy jumped up\r\nand down gleefully. "It must be a whole mile long, Daddy! What kind is\r\nit?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s the Vanguard, son."\r\n\r\nAn autumn breeze from the East River chilled their vantage point at\r\nSixty-First Street and Fifth Avenue.\r\n\r\n"The Vanguard?" The name meant nothing to the boy. "Gee, I\'ll bet it can\r\nfly all the way to the stars!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s the rocket that carried the first artificial satellite into\r\nspace."\r\n\r\nThe parade, now three hours old, continued past the reviewing stand.\r\n\r\n"I wanna get a better look at the Vanguard!" the boy shouted.\r\n\r\nThe father lifted the boy onto his shoulders. The little fellow laughed\r\nand whooped it up, firing several shots from his Captain Video Ray gun\r\nat the passing missile.\r\n\r\nThe rocket moved on and the noise of the crowd diminished slightly.\r\n\r\nA one-hundred piece brass band was passing in front of them. They were\r\nplaying "The Stars and Stripes Forever." They were followed by the Sak\'s\r\nFifth Avenue display; nine small floats, each depicting life on another\r\nplanet. The National Academy of Sciences had a success on its hands.\r\n\r\n"Wow! Daddy, I wanna ride on it! I wanna ride on that float and visit\r\nall those planets! Can I, Daddy!" The boy became all limbs trying to\r\nsquirm down from his father\'s shoulders.\r\n\r\n"You stay right where you are, young man," the father struggled to hold\r\nhis balance.\r\n\r\n"But I wanna go to the stars. I can watch the rest of the parade from\r\nVenus or Mercury! Please, Daddy!"\r\n\r\nThe father grinned. "Not just yet, son, but it won\'t be long before man\r\nwill go to the stars."\r\n\r\n"Who lives up there, Daddy?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, there isn\'t any life up there yet."\r\n\r\n"If no one\'s living up there why does anyone want to go there?"\r\n\r\n"Well, maybe there\'ll be too many people on earth someday and then we\'ll\r\nhave to find other planets with more room."\r\n\r\nAnother monstrous brass band was going by. The boy became restless. He\r\nbegan to toy with his ray gun, half interested in seeing if there were\r\nany sparks left in it. "Why can\'t there be something besides so many\r\nbands in a parade? I wanna see another float."\r\n\r\nThe father tried to interest the boy by pointing out all the famous\r\npeople who were also there: a variety of statesmen the world\'s leading\r\nscientists and religious and cultural leaders, the president of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe boy was interested but not in what his elder was saying to him. He\r\nwas looking downtown, his eyes squinting, trying to make out figures as\r\nfar away as Fifty-sixth Street. Then his mouth opened, not uttering a\r\nsound yet, just waiting to burst with joy at what was coming toward\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nHis father looked up at him. "I wish you\'d tell me what you are looking\r\nat. I\'m all the way down here on street level, remember?"\r\n\r\n"Daddy, they look like ants!"\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"Ants, Daddy, ants! A whole army of them. Ain\'t it exciting?

=== Chunk 9 ===
"\r\n\r\n"What on earth are you talking about?"\r\n\r\n"They\'re doing somersaults and back flips and everything! They\'re coming\r\nright this way! Gee, there\'s hundreds of them. And they got a float\r\nbehind them, Daddy! A great big float with something burning on it."\r\n\r\nThe child sitting on his shoulders made mobility impossible for the\r\nfather. And he couldn\'t see around the spectators. He resigned himself\r\nto stand and wait for this new spectacle to overtake them. The reaction\r\nto this new sight had already begun to work its way uptown. In the\r\ndistance, but getting closer every second, he could hear unrestrained\r\nlaughter and rejoicing.\r\n\r\n"Hey, take it easy!" The boy was beginning to ride the shoulders like a\r\nbronco buster. "By the time they get here I won\'t have any shoulders\r\nleft. Where are they now?"\r\n\r\n"They\'re almost here, Daddy! And they aren\'t ants at all. They\'re just a\r\nbunch of clowns dressed up like it." He began to giggle hysterically.\r\n"Golly, they\'re funny. Can you see them yet, Daddy?"\r\n\r\nBefore the father could produce an answer the ants were in view. They\r\nwere a sight that couldn\'t fail to stimulate the funny bone. By\r\ncomparison with real ants everything about them had been grossly\r\nexaggerated to achieve the proper effect. They walked on their two back\r\nlegs but the four front apertures were far from idle. Some of them\r\nturned somersaults, others did complicated flips consisting of two or\r\nthree spins in mid-air. Still others, doing a kind of animated cakewalk,\r\ncarried toy ray guns which they fired at random into the crowd. The\r\nguns were something like the little boy\'s Captain Video ray gun, only\r\nlarger. They emitted little streaks of blue sparks which shone brightly\r\nbut disappeared when contact was made with air.\r\n\r\nThey were easily the hit of the parade, a three ring circus all by\r\nthemselves, as they pranced and clowned their way up Fifth Avenue giving\r\nthe spectators a whale of a show that was completely new.\r\n\r\nThe guests on the reviewing stand refrained from any hilarity until they\r\nsaw the float that four of the ants were pulling behind them. It was in\r\nkeeping with the rest of the nonsense they were perpetrating. The float\r\nboasted eight larger ray guns, three on either side and two in the rear,\r\nthat fired the same fascinating blue sparks. Behind each gun an ant\r\nstood on its head, wildly waving six legs in the breeze, begging to be\r\nnoticed and laughed at. Above the guns, emblazoned in fiery orange\r\nletters, were the words: "MARTIAN V.F.W." This was interpreted by one\r\nand all as a punch line and was treated accordingly.\r\n\r\nIt was heartwarming to be able to see the president and so many other\r\ndignitaries abandon composure in favor of a good old fashioned belly\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n"Daddy, I can\'t laugh any more," the boy had to pause between every\r\nother word. "My stomach hurts. Aren\'t they the funniest things you ever\r\nsaw?"\r\n\r\nThe father was too convulsed to be able to answer him.\r\n\r\n"Daddy, one of them is coming this way! He\'s firing his Captain Video\r\nray gun at us!" They boy squeezed his father and held on tight.\r\n\r\nThe father took a deep breath in order to be able to speak. "Take your\r\ngun and fire back at him, son. Fire away! Go on, he\'s just being\r\nplayful!" He broke forth with another gust of laughter. "I won\'t see\r\nanything as funny as this again if I live to be a hundred!"\r\n\r\nThe ant pranced over to where they were standing, firing its gun in\r\nevery direction. The boy fired back. The ant took one look at the lad\'s\r\ngun and let out a long cackling sound which built to a crescendo and\r\nthen stopped as though it had been turned off. The ant rejoined the\r\ngroup and they continued on their merry way.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe boy fired several shots into the float as it passed. He wanted to\r\nsee if he could knock out those blazing orange letters: MARTIAN V.F.W.\r\nThe letters continued to burn, but in the boy\'s mind he was certain he\r\nhad made several direct hits.\r\n\r\nThe boy and his father watched the float until it was out of sight. They\r\nknew there wouldn\'t be another attraction like those ants. They must\r\nhave been real professionals, the father thought. Such teamwork! Such\r\nprecision! 

=== Chunk 10 ===
Each one of them having a specific job to do and each doing\r\nit to perfection. After them everything was bound to be anticlimactic.\r\n\r\nMore marchers, more bands, a few more floats. The boy was beginning to\r\ntire. It had been a long day. Now everything was dull. "Daddy, I don\'t\r\nwant to see any more. Let\'s go home."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll stay another five minutes."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe parade somehow seemed to be slowing down. The father yawned and let\r\nhis son down from his shoulders. He looked across the street at the\r\npresident and the other dignitaries on the reviewing stand. All were\r\nslowly raising their hands in salute as another color guard drowsily\r\nmade its way by.\r\n\r\nSoon the last group in the parade was passing the reviewing stand.\r\nAnother brass band. They were moving with the speed of a glacier. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
A full\r\nfive seconds elapsed between each note of music. Everything was\r\nhappening in slow motion. On the reviewing stand the dignified hands\r\nwent up, agonizingly slow, to a final salute and they stayed there. The\r\ngreatest minds in the world stood motionless, unalterably still. Just as\r\neach wave of pandemonium had unfurled itself up Fifth Avenue during the\r\nparade, so now did silence take command.\r\n\r\nThe little boy tugged at his father\'s coat. "Daddy! Daddy," he\r\npleaded, "why has the parade stopped? I wan-na-go-home--" His\r\nwords came more slowly with each passing second, like a high\r\nspeed phonograph playing at thirty-three and a third r.p.m.\r\n"Dad-dy--why--don\'t--you--an--swer--me--Da--ddy--why--don\'t--" His\r\nfather never heard him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFifty miles above the Atlantic the fleet of spaceships hung suspended\r\nlike lanterns. In the lead ship the ant in charge of communications\r\nreported to the commander.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve just received the first communique from the advance guard, sir."\r\n\r\n"Read it to me.

=== Chunk 12 ===
"\r\n\r\nThe communications chief read from a large perforated paper.\r\n"Time--0600--mission accomplished. Manhattan island cut down the\r\nmiddle--immediate result of super-isonic rays; four million dead--rays\r\nspreading east and west--estimated time of rays\' full effect;\r\n0800--island will then be neutralized--awaiting further orders." The ant\r\nfolded the paper and looked up at the commander. "Shall I relay further\r\norders, sir?"\r\n\r\n"No." The commander of the ants paused and stroked his chin. "We\'re\r\nmoving in."\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\nThis etext was produced from _Amazing Science Fiction Stories_ May 1959.\r\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright\r\non this publication was renewed.
