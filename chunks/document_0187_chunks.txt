=== Chunk 2 ===
"\r\n             He smiled grimly. Yes, he knew what to do....\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n                      Planet Stories Winter 1946.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fifth Sector Commander was known as a rigid man, that was true, and\r\nyet no one could say exactly how rigid.\r\n\r\nHis office, aboard the _Polaris_, was a rather grim place. All command\r\noffices were, essentially, being limited pretty much to regulation\r\nfurnishings, but rare was the Commander who did not manage to plant\r\nsome of his personality there. It was perhaps characteristic of\r\nCommander Gray that there was only one item in his office which could\r\nbe said to reveal anything about him.\r\n\r\nHe sat now behind the cubical steel desk and looked down at the glowing\r\nscreen of the television set. The face in it was not at ease. Far from\r\nit.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, John Brullar, the Commissioner over Gray, was a\r\nself-important, unconsciously comical person. Now he looked neither\r\ncomical nor important. He just looked very, very frightened.\r\n\r\nHe licked his trembling lips and said, in a voice hoarse with fear,\r\n"Of _course_ there is something you can do, Commander! After all,"\r\nhe brightened faintly, "there are important people on the _Stella_.\r\nImportant people." He emphasized "important."\r\n\r\n"I am aware of that, Commissioner Brullar," said the Commander. "Yet,\r\nwhat can I do?"\r\n\r\n"You have authority!" sputtered Brullar. "And you know what you can\r\n_do_! Get through to Interstellar Command on Sirius VII and tell them\r\njust exactly what these Beolins are up to!" He glared, a fat man in\r\nmortal fear for his life. "And you can do it quickly, Commander!\r\nQuickly, do you understand?"\r\n\r\n"I understand," the Commander said.\r\n\r\n"Good." Brullar started to speak again, gulped, hesitated, and finally\r\nrepeated, "Good." He switched off.\r\n\r\nThe Commander gazed reflectively down the catwalk, through the ship,\r\nat the faint glimmer of green outside of an open lock. There was a\r\nturbulence deep in his steel-colored eyes. He tapped a small stud with\r\na slim, tapering forefinger.\r\n\r\nKina Staun came in.\r\n\r\nKina wasn\'t all Solarian. He had enough Sol blood in him to make him\r\none in almost every respect, but there were differences, if you looked\r\nclosely. He was the Commander\'s personal aide. There was actually\r\nmore than that between them. The tremendousness of all the Commander\r\ngoverned--and which Kina helped him run--made for a rather involved\r\nrelationship.\r\n\r\nWhen people saw the Commander, they looked for Kina Staun. The two\r\nhad not been a hundred yards apart since they had first met as\r\nnewly-appointed official and aide. It was said that Kina knew every\r\nbit as much about the Fifth Sector and the Commander\'s work as the\r\nCommander knew himself.\r\n\r\nFor that reason, if Kina ever left his post, he would certainly die\r\nwithin an hour.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Commander said, "Kina, call Hauns." The Secretary showed no\r\nsurprise, but somehow managed to give that impression.\r\n\r\n"The city of Hauns, capitol of Beolin III, the ruling planet of the\r\nBeolin system?" he asked very respectfully.\r\n\r\n"Yes. I want to talk to their Commissioner-in-Chief. And also find the\r\npresent location of the _Stella_."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," said Kina.\r\n\r\nHe came back within ten seconds. "The _Stella_," he said, "is now at\r\n3rd Quadrant 3521 NA, W-88236. Speed, one light-year per hour. Heading,\r\n338 Degrees NA of nearest sun, Beolin. And I have Beolin Command for\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nThe Commander touched a switch and the screen flicked on again. "Thank\r\nyou, Kina," he said.\r\n\r\nThe face in the screen was definitely not human. Its structure, and\r\neven more, its expression was alien. It was distinctly unpleasant.\r\n\r\nIt belonged to Krraula, who was Commander-in-Chief, and the foremost\r\nmurderer of the Beolin System. He smiled, a smile that was not a smile.\r\nHe said, "Ah, Commander." And he saluted, sneering slightly.\r\n\r\nThe Commander said, "Greetings, Krraula. I would like to inquire the\r\nreason for your fleet being in its present position."\r\n\r\nKrraula smiled again. "The fleet, Commander? Merely maneuvers," he said\r\nslyly. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
"Why do you ask?"\r\n\r\n"There is a liner transiting through the outer fringes of your\r\nterritory in--" he looked at a paper Kina had slipped before him\r\n"--about four hours. I would appreciate it if your fleet is withdrawn\r\nin time. It would not go well, Krraula, if an ... accident ... were to\r\nhappen to this liner of which I speak. I think you understand."\r\n\r\nHe gave Krraula no time to answer, but switched off. He sat back, and\r\nlooked aimlessly at Kina.\r\n\r\n"Kina," he said, after a few moments of thought.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Commander."\r\n\r\n"Do you get the framework of this problem?"\r\n\r\n"I do, sir," answered the aide.\r\n\r\n"Good. Let me hear it."\r\n\r\n"The question is one of Command," said Kina Staun quietly. "Out here in\r\nthe stars, power--the authority to command--goes not to men\'s heads but\r\nto their souls. Krraula of Beolin is an example, and, in a different\r\nway--"\r\n\r\n"Myself?"\r\n\r\n"No, Commander Brullar. He is the brass-hat type, while Krraula is\r\nsimply a tyrannical madman."\r\n\r\n"So far, you\'re right. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
But what of _this_ particular problem?

=== Chunk 5 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," the aide said. "Krraula, and the Beolin rulers, have power\r\nin and about their system to the extent that their depredations go\r\nunchallenged there. And an apathetic Interstellar Command--"\r\n\r\n"Does not act," finished the Commander. "You are entirely correct,\r\nKina." He touched studs on the desk and reports slid through the viewer\r\non the wall. He said quietly, "We have lost a score of ships--ships\r\nthat we are sure the Beolins could tell us about. And yet the Command\r\ndoes not act." He looked reflectively at the slim, impassive man, and\r\nthen spoke swiftly.\r\n\r\n"Kina, I want you to get me two more connections ... Sirius VII, and\r\nthe Command Cruiser nearest to Beolin. Hurry! 

=== Chunk 6 ===
The cruiser first."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA minute or so later, Kina slipped a sheet of paper onto the desk, and\r\ntouched a switch. The screen glittered into life, showing the face of\r\na man who wore a captain\'s shoulder bars. Glancing at the paper, which\r\ngave the name of the officer and the ship, the Commander said, "Captain\r\nStang, how far are you from Beolin?"\r\n\r\n"Roughly twenty light years, sir," was the immediate answer.\r\n\r\n"Do you think that you can make a speed of--say--five light-years per\r\nhour, or perhaps more?"\r\n\r\nThe captain frowned slightly. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
"I\'m not sure, Commander. Perhaps we can."\r\n\r\n"Good! Stand by, at your present position in space." Gray switched off.\r\n\r\nKina spoke softly at his side. "That one cruiser, Commander, is more\r\nthan a match for the entire Beolin fleet." He paused. "Here is your\r\ncall to Sirius Headquarters, sir."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "That one cruiser, Commander, is more than a match for\r\nthe entire Beolin fleet."]\r\n\r\nThe Commander turned back to the screen. "Over-Commissioner Branu, are\r\nyou aware of the present stage of relations with Beolin?"\r\n\r\nThe Over-Commissioner frowned at him. "Certainly! Why are you asking,\r\nCommander?" There was an imperious sharpness in his voice.\r\n\r\n"What are they?"\r\n\r\nBranu hesitated, said, "Relations are somewhat strained at present, of\r\ncourse, but not seriously. I--"\r\n\r\n"Suppose proof was given that Beolin was back of the recent\r\ndisappearances of spacecraft?"\r\n\r\n"My dear Commander Gray! You--you must not say that! Such an intimation\r\nmight _easily_ cost you your post! Why--"\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner cut him off.\r\n\r\n"You see, Commander," said Kina, "the Command simply cannot think of\r\nsuch a thing."\r\n\r\n"Yes ... but they could be made--forced--to think of it."\r\n\r\n"There is only one way to do _that_," said Kina. "Only one way."\r\n\r\n"Yes." Commander Gray fell silent for a minute, and then said quietly,\r\n"Kina."\r\n\r\n"I am listening, sir."\r\n\r\n"The hands of one man," said the Commander, "were never meant to hold\r\npersonal power such as this. We can do only the best we can ... and it\r\nwill never be perfect. We must be prepared to--" he hesitated slightly\r\nbefore going on "--to set aside all personal things, and substitute the\r\nstars for them. Because only in that way can we approach perfection."\r\n\r\nKina was silent and attentive, but his eyes flickered for a second\r\nacross the one personal item in the office.\r\n\r\n"I am not a god, Kina. And yet I must be. Because there are men--such\r\nas Krraula--who think they are." He fell silent.\r\n\r\nThen he said, "A god _must_ have power of life ... and death."\r\n\r\nThe screen was on again and, once more, it was Commissioner Brullar. He\r\nwas almost frantic.\r\n\r\n"Commander Gray! Have you acted yet? 

=== Chunk 8 ===
The captain says that we are being\r\nscreened out. Only this special set can get through--and only to you!"\r\nHe gulped, mopping at his forehead. "Commander, I have my entire family\r\naboard this ship! I--I know that you...." His voice faltered for an\r\ninstant. "Can\'t _you_ get through to the Command?"\r\n\r\nThen, nervously, without waiting for a reply, he plunged on. "The\r\nCaptain of the _Stella_ says he believes there is an Interstellar\r\nCommand cruiser within four hours or so. Can\'t you get it here? It\r\ncould escort us through the edge of the Beolin system in safety!\r\nCommander Gray, I in--"\r\n\r\nThe Commander cut Brullar off.\r\n\r\n"Kina," he asked, "what do you think the effect of a Beolin massacre\r\nwould be on the Command?"\r\n\r\n"Roughly estimating, Commander, considerably more than the effect of an\r\nunleashed power beam on inert matter."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the Commander. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
"Yes. Kina, at least ten thousand human\r\nlives have been lost on ships that I _know_ have been captured by the\r\nBeolins. Unless the Command takes action--now--there will never be a\r\ncheck on Krraula and his successors. And only a shocking catastrophe\r\nwould stir up the Sirius Command Headquarter. A certain kind of\r\ncatastrophe."\r\n\r\n"The sacrifice justifies itself," said Kina Staun. "The moral laws, the\r\nvery framework of civilization itself, is now of a shape incredible to\r\nthe person of two or three hundred years ago."\r\n\r\n"My orders, then, should be...?"\r\n\r\nKina stood up, stiffly. "It would be presumptuous of me, Commander."\r\n\r\nThe silence did not last very long.\r\n\r\nAt last the Commander said, "Kina, order Captain Stang to resume\r\nhis usual patrol activities. Arrange to follow the _Stella_ with a\r\nlong-range recording beam. Prepare for the Interstellar Command\'s\r\norder ... to proceed with a punitive expedition against the Beolin\r\nsystem." He looked long down the catwalk, and his fingers slowly closed\r\nabout the one personal touch to his office.\r\n\r\nHis voice was very low. "No more messages are to be received from the\r\n_Stella_."\r\n\r\nAnd he opened his hand.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLater, after the Commander had gone down the catwalk to walk about for\r\na while on the soft, Earthlike greenness of this world\'s vegetation,\r\nKina bent to pick up that which had fallen to the floor.\r\n\r\nIt was a color photograph, and the cold plastic sheen of the film\r\nsomehow managed to convey the impression of the blonde, young woman\'s\r\nsoft, warm loveliness.\r\n\r\nIt was inscribed, "_With all my love, John. Myra._" Kina had often seen\r\nCommissioner Brullar\'s daughter.\r\n\r\nHe dropped the photograph in to a disposal chute, and turned to some\r\npapers that had to be filed.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
