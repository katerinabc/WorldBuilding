Cydwick\r\n    Ohms, guaranteed to solve the accumulated problems of the world of\r\n    the year 2057._\r\n\r\n\r\n    of\r\n  time\r\n   and\r\n texas\r\n\r\n _by ... William F. Nolan_\r\n\r\n\r\n Open the C. Cydwick Ohms Time\r\n Door, take but a single step, and--\r\n\r\n\r\n"In one fell swoop," declared Professor C. Cydwick Ohms, releasing a\r\nthin blue ribbon of pipe-smoke and rocking back on his heels, "--I\r\nintend to solve the greatest problem facing mankind today. Colonizing\r\nthe Polar Wastes was a messy and fruitless business.

And the Enforced\r\nBirth Control Program couldn\'t be enforced. Overpopulation still remains\r\nthe thorn in our side. Gentlemen--" He paused to look each of the\r\nassembled reporters in the eye. "--there is but _one_ answer."\r\n\r\n"Mass annihilation?" quavered a cub reporter.\r\n\r\n"Posh, boy! Certainly not!"

The professor bristled. "The answer\r\nis--TIME!"\r\n\r\n"Time?"\r\n\r\n"Exactly," nodded Ohms. With a dramatic flourish he swept aside a red\r\nvelvet drape--to reveal a tall structure of gleaming metal. "As\r\nwitness!

"\r\n\r\n"Golly, what\'s _that_ thing?" queried the cub.\r\n\r\n"This _thing_," replied the professor acidly, "--is the C. Cydwick Ohms\r\nTime Door."\r\n\r\n"Whillikers, a Time Machine!"\r\n\r\n"Not so, not so. _Please_, boy! A Time Machine, in the popular sense,\r\nis impossible. Wild fancy! However--" The professor tapped the dottle\r\nfrom his pipe. "--by a mathematically precise series of infinite\r\ncalculations, I have developed the remarkable C. Cydwick Ohms Time Door.\r\nOpen it, take but a single step--and, presto! The Past!"\r\n\r\n"But, _where_ in the past, Prof.?"\r\n\r\nOhms smiled easily down at the tense ring of faces. "Gentlemen, beyond\r\nthis door lies the sprawling giant of the Southwest--enough land to\r\nabsorb Earth\'s overflow like _that_!" He snapped his fingers. "I speak,\r\ngentlemen, of Texas, 1957!"\r\n\r\n"What if the Texans _object_?"\r\n\r\n"They have no choice. The Time Door is strictly a one-way passage. I saw\r\nto that. It will be utterly impossible for anyone in 1957 to re-enter\r\nour world of 2057. And now--the Past awaits!"\r\n\r\nHe tossed aside his professorial robes. Under them Cydwick Ohms wore an\r\nancient and bizarre costume: black riding boots, highly polished and\r\ntrimmed in silver; wool chaps; a wide, jewel-studded belt with an\r\nimmense buckle; a brightly checked shirt topped by a blazing red\r\nbandana. Briskly, he snapped a tall ten-gallon hat on his head, and\r\nstepped to the Time Door.\r\n\r\nGripping an ebony handle, he tugged upward. The huge metal door oiled\r\nslowly back. "Time," said Cydwick Ohms simply, gesturing toward the gray\r\nnothingness beyond the door.\r\n\r\nThe reporters and photographers surged forward, notebooks and cameras at\r\nthe ready. "What if the door swings shut after you\'re gone?" one of them\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n"A groundless fear, boy," assured Ohms. "I have seen to it that the Time\r\nDoor can never be closed. And now--good-bye, gentlemen. Or, to use the\r\nproper colloquialism--_so long, hombres!_"\r\n\r\nOhms bowed from the waist, gave his ten-gallon hat a final tug, and took\r\na single step forward.\r\n\r\nAnd did _not_ disappear.\r\n\r\nHe stood, blinking. Then he swore, beat upon the unyielding wall of\r\ngrayness with clenched fists, and fell back, panting, to his desk.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve failed!" he moaned in a lost voice. "The C. Cydwick Ohms Time Door\r\nis a botch!" He buried his head in trembling hands.\r\n\r\nThe reporters and photographers began to file out.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the professor raised his head. "_Listen!_" he warned.\r\n\r\nA slow rumbling, muted with distance, emanated from the dense grayness\r\nof the Time Door. Faint yips and whoopings were distinct above the\r\nrumble. The sounds grew steadily--to a thousand beating drums--to a\r\nrolling sea of thunder!\r\n\r\nShrieking, the reporters and photographers scattered for the stairs.\r\n\r\nAh, another knotty problem to be solved, mused Professor Cydwick Ohms,\r\nswinging, with some difficulty, onto one of three thousand Texas steers\r\nstampeding into the laboratory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ November 1956.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.
