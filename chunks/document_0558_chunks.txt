He basked in flames._"]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe lived. He was aware. He was everything in his world. He was....\r\n\r\nFlames wrapped themselves around his body, pouring sinuously around\r\nhim. For a few seconds, as he stood in the center of the floor, he\r\nwrithed; pure reflex; then he relaxed and gave himself up to the heady\r\nluxury of the roaring fire which clothed his body. He basked in flames.\r\n\r\nHis mind was afire, too. _It feels like ... like satin ice! No, it\'s\r\ndifferent. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
It\'s_ ... it was something new; his senses were still\r\nadjusting themselves to the new reality, and his mind contained no\r\nimages with which to compare it. He didn\'t see or hear Fran open the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n"_MAX!_"\r\n\r\nHe shook his flaming body and a few brief cinders fell away in sparks.\r\nThen, suddenly, he had snuffed out the aura of flames; he was standing\r\nnude on a smoking carpet, grinning tentatively at the girl. He\r\nswallowed and said "Hell of a time for you to show up, Fran."\r\n\r\nShe seemed to stare at him without seeing him, her face taut, without\r\nexpression. He blinked, slowly coming down or up to reality again. Good\r\nGod, yes, she thought he\'d been burning up. The odor of the carpet--it\r\nsmelled like scorching hair.\r\n\r\n"I forgot about the carpet." He watched her glance down at it. Acrid\r\nsmoke still curled away from two singed-bare patches where he\'d been\r\nstanding.\r\n\r\nSlowly, Fran raised her eyes back to his. She said "Max--!"\r\n\r\nShe took one faltering step toward him; then she crumpled and swayed\r\nforward. He caught her in his arms as she fell, straining her close.\r\nThe physical contact of their bodies brought him back to the level of\r\nreality again, to a complete realization of Fran\'s plight. He tried to\r\nmake his grip as firm, as reassuring as he could--to bring her back to\r\na world in which men were not, one minute, cloaked in streaming flame,\r\nand the next minute alive and human and--\r\n\r\n"Max!" She straightened, "You don\'t have any _clothes_ on!"\r\n\r\n"I know. I lose more pajamas that way," he said, lightly, keeping his\r\nvoice casual. "Sit down, Fran, and I\'ll put on a pair of pants, at\r\nleast."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHer face was chalk-white; the color had drained from her mouth, leaving\r\nthe lipstick like paint on a corpse. She was rigid with shock. She\r\nhardly seemed to hear him, and let him lead her, like a child, to the\r\nsofa. _Oh, God, why did she have to come in just now?_\r\n\r\n"Lie down here for a minute, Fran. Here, put your feet up on the arm.\r\nFran, it\'s all right, I\'m all right; take it easy, now. I\'ll be right\r\nback."\r\n\r\nHe retreated into the bedroom, quietly closed the door behind him, and\r\nleaned against it for a moment. His whole body slumped.\r\n\r\nThe room was quiet, just a third-floor bedroom in an old house, now a\r\nconverted rooming-house for students, half filled with sunlight. Max\r\nheard his own breathing loud in the silence, looked down at his naked\r\nbody, then at his pants, draped over the bed. He stared at them and\r\nclosed his eyes. His body grew rigid.\r\n\r\nSlowly, the pants began to stir as if with a breeze; but all else was\r\nstill. Sunlight cut across the stationary dust-motes suspended in\r\nmid-air, and the warm summer noon seemed to hold its breath. The pants\r\nlegs flapped.\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, the room was filled with a timeless density. The\r\nsilence of the moment before thickened into a tangible, measurable\r\ndimension, possessing a reality of its own. He could taste the silence.\r\n\r\nHe rose three feet into the air, his head clearing the ceiling by\r\ninches. As he did so, the tension dissolved from his muscles; he lay\r\nloose-flung on the air and watched articles of clothing, first his\r\nbriefs, then pants, sweatshirt, socks and finally shoes, moving to him\r\nand draping themselves over, around, up and onto his body, flowing onto\r\nhim as if themselves fluid.\r\n\r\nThe door opened before he reached it. He took a deep breath, set his\r\nfeet on the floor, and walked into the other room. Fran started upright\r\nas he came in, and flinched away.\r\n\r\n"Fran, are you afraid of me?"\r\n\r\nShe nodded, moving her mouth mutely.\r\n\r\n_Easy, for God\'s sake, easy, the girl\'s on the ragged edge of\r\nhysterics. Take the light touch._\r\n\r\n"Afraid of me? Now that I\'m fully clothed again and didn\'t even attempt\r\nfelonious rape?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t laugh," she said, finding her voice. "I know what you\'re trying\r\nto do. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
But--don\'t. And don\'t tell me that I didn\'t see--what I saw."\r\nHer eyes moved quickly, a little rabbit movement, to the charred\r\ncarpet, and away again.\r\n\r\n"Fran." He seated himself beside her and took her face in his hands.\r\n"I\'m not denying anything. What you saw--it happened, yes--but it\r\nwasn\'t--" he ran out of words.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not crazy! And it wasn\'t an illusion!"\r\n\r\n"Okay, then! I\'m a warlock! I weave dark spells! I\'ve sold my soul to\r\nthe devil! Do you like that any better?" He flung the words at her,\r\nbitterly.\r\n\r\n"_Are_ you, Max?" she asked softly, when he had run down.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. I don\'t--Fran!" He fell against her, and felt her arms\r\nreach out for him, hold him as he collapsed at her side.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe touch did what words had failed to do; he felt the rigid, frozen\r\nfright flow out of her as she held him; hard, clasping his spent body\r\nin her arms. With a sigh, she drew his head against the softness of her\r\nbreast and let him lie there.\r\n\r\nThis was the best way. It had come to him without words; perhaps there\r\nwere no words. But what had he done to Fran, to this shy girl who held\r\nhim now so tightly? He sensed, through the tension of her terror and\r\nits release, that she loved him--did he love her? When he had asked\r\nhimself that, he could not answer--yet now, in his response to her, he\r\nsensed his own answer.\r\n\r\nWords, more words--what did they mean? Reasoning was a barrier, not a\r\npath. He had always felt most apart from her when he had tried to think\r\nout their relationship into words. Better to let the words go, better\r\nto react.\r\n\r\nThey lay together unmoving on the sofa for a moment which was, for\r\nthem, timeless--perhaps fifteen minutes, perhaps two or three hours.\r\nThey exchanged no words, no gestures, not even a kiss. They simply\r\n_were_, sharing a moment of that meshed, tangible silence in which\r\nthere was no Max, no Fran; instead a gestalt, a separate emotional\r\nentity.\r\n\r\n"Tell me about it," she said finally.\r\n\r\nIt was like surfacing after a deep dive. He blinked. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
"I don\'t know what\r\nhappened."\r\n\r\n"How did it begin?"\r\n\r\nHe turned slightly, snuggling closer to her, his cheek buried against\r\nher neck, his shoulder tucked under her arm, her arms warm around his\r\nbody. He paused, then reached out for words and found that the words\r\nwere there.\r\n\r\n"If you want to be rational about it--that is, if we _can_ be rational\r\nabout it--I guess it\'s what you\'d call a wild talent."\r\n\r\n"_Wild_ is right," she said with a shaky laugh.\r\n\r\n"Psi power, I guess you\'d call it--I can make things move, or--things\r\nhappen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"I had a dream last night. It was a very strange kind of dream--you\r\nknow how sometimes you have dreams about flying? Like, you\'re running\r\nalong on the ground, and sometimes you can jump, and pull your feet\r\ninto the air, and then you paddle yourself along with your hands--?\r\nI dreamed I\'d done this and I was floating and weightless, pulling\r\nmyself around with handholds like an astronaut in a spaceship, only\r\nthe handholds were the branches of a tree. I was floating, and pulling\r\nmyself into the tree.\r\n\r\n"Things began feeling strange. Like they were happening in double--like\r\nthe dream was fading out into sleepwalking. And then I woke up.\r\n\r\n"Fran, _I was holding on to the curtains of the window next to my bed,\r\nand I was floating about even with the top of the open window!_"\r\n\r\nHe felt her arms tighten around him, but she neither moved nor\r\ninterrupted him. Blessing her, he went on;\r\n\r\n"It scared me silly, but my first thought was; _Migod, I nearly flew\r\nout the window_--just as matter-of-fact about it as if I\'d been\r\nsleepwalking and woke up and said, _Oh, I almost walked down those\r\nstairs_. And then I guess I woke up the rest of the way and really\r\nrealized what was happening, and the next thing I knew, I was lying\r\ncross-ways on the bed, with all the breath knocked out of me."\r\n\r\nHis body had tensed again with the growing excitement in his voice;\r\nsensing it, he shivered and moved closer into the warmth of her arms.\r\n"Fran, don\'t let me do anything _now_!"\r\n\r\nSlowly, under the reassurance of her touch, he felt the spasm dissolve,\r\nflow into words again.\r\n\r\n"When I woke up, I thought it had all been a dream--I mean, I wanted to\r\nbelieve I\'d dreamed it, but I knew better. I wandered out here into the\r\nliving room, and just kind of went through the motions of breakfast,\r\nwithout noticing what I was doing. After a while I--well, located\r\nmyself sitting at the table, staring at my coffee and realizing it had\r\ngone cold. I wasn\'t thinking, Fran, I wasn\'t thinking about anything.\r\nI was just staring at that coffee and wishing it was good and hot\r\nagain, and--and then it started _steaming_.\r\n\r\n"Fran, I didn\'t touch it, I just looked at it. I looked at it, and\r\nsuddenly I wasn\'t just looking at a cup-of-coffee any more. I began\r\nto see it--really _see_ it. I began to see the relationships of every\r\ncomponent in the cup and the coffee, the chemical and molecular--no,\r\nthat\'s not what I mean, either--I could see, not really with my eyes,\r\nthe entire series of relationships between all the overlapping fields\r\nof energy--no--" he broke off again, helplessly.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t make sense of it for you. I don\'t have the words, maybe there\r\naren\'t any--I could _see_ it, you understand; I didn\'t try to explain\r\nit, even to myself. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
I can\'t, now. It\'s just--everything\'s _motion_, and\r\nI could reach out and--and speed it up, or slow it down, and I\'d heated\r\nit up--" he shook his head a little and was silent, clinging to her.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHer voice was levelled when she spoke, a flat surface spread thin over\r\npanic; toneless. "I\'m not a--a nuclear physicist, but it sounds as\r\nif you were trying to put the theory of atoms and force-fields into\r\none word. Like--matter not being solid but just little bits of loose\r\nenergy whirling around and building up into atoms and the atoms into\r\nmolecules."\r\n\r\n"That--I guess so. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
As if I\'d learned to--oh, to see into them. But how?\r\n_Why?_"\r\n\r\n"It takes in a lot of territory," she said, still the flat stretched\r\ntoneless voice. "Just to wake up and find out you had it, whatever it\r\nwas."\r\n\r\nHe hardly heard. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
He drew himself upright, his hands clasped, tensing,\r\nsearching for words. "Like--like ice and water and steam are all the\r\nsame thing, only we see them differently. We just see different aspects\r\nof the same thing, and it\'s all the same, all this--_motion_. And I\r\ncould control it! I could control _everything_!"\r\n\r\n"Max--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know. It\'s frightening. I\'m still afraid, and I think I\'ve been\r\nafraid ever since I woke up from that dream. I\'m afraid to really try\r\nanything--oh, thank God you came, Fran! Thank God! I think I\'d have\r\ncracked up if you hadn\'t!"\r\n\r\nBut the moment of complete and intense rapport was gone; Fran had drawn\r\naway from him again, and he felt cold and afraid. He had said too much;\r\nshe was afraid of him again, and her fear, like her love, communicated\r\nitself to him through the impalpable fibres in his very skin. He soaked\r\nup her fear and babbled it forth again.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been afraid to really try anything, because that\'s playing God.\r\nI\'ve been doing parlor tricks, Fran, because I haven\'t really wanted to\r\nface the fact that I could do so much more than that!\r\n\r\n"Think about it! I turned the air around myself to flames--and\r\nburned off my pajamas before I thought to do more than protect my\r\nbody--because that was sort of wild and weird and ego-inflating. I\'ve\r\nwished my clothes on, and levitated, and moved things around--but these\r\nare _little_ things! Petty things. But Fran, I could have done so much\r\nmore--I could wipe out war--there are a thousand ways I could do it. I\r\ncould feed the starving and house the homeless--Hell, that\'s minuscule,\r\nI could change this whole damn planet, I could change _myself_,\r\nmake my body so I could go anywhere, anywhere in the whole physical\r\nuniverse--Fran, _I could be God!_"\r\n\r\nHis whole body shook. "I could be God, and I\'m playing with burning\r\ncarpets! Fran--oh, Fran, it\'s too much for me! I\'m not God, I don\'t\r\nwant it, I\'m too small for it--I wish it was only a dream and now I\r\ncould really wake up and find it never happened--oh, Fran, Fran, tell\r\nme what I am, tell me what to do!"\r\n\r\nAware only of pain and terror, he felt his face wet and did not even\r\nknow he was sobbing.\r\n\r\n"You\'re Max, _Max_," Fran wept, "You\'re Max, and I love you--"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAgain the touch calmed him. He clutched at her desperately, clinging\r\nto reality, to the wholeness and rightness of her body in his arms, in\r\na sort of senseless terror lest that, too, should dissolve suddenly\r\ninto a flux of intermingling atoms and force-fields. He was aware only\r\nof Fran, close and warm against him, their mingling breath, his own\r\nrising hunger and need. He wanted to melt into her, lose himself in her\r\nflesh and her reality. The clothes she was wearing separated them, were\r\na senseless intrusion into his longing for contact, for one-ness. He\r\nmoved. They were gone, her body warm and naked in his arms.\r\n\r\n"Fran!"\r\n\r\nBut she was white and rigid in his arms, thrusting him away, gasping\r\nwith terror. "What are you doing? Max, no!"\r\n\r\nIt was an icy shock, a rejection like a flood of ice, thrusting him\r\nback into the wild senselessness of his sudden mad universe. He felt\r\nonly the desolation of being alone. He wept, feeling the tears on his\r\ncheek.\r\n\r\nDid God cry?\r\n\r\nCrying? Clutching desperately at this frigid slip of a girl for\r\nsalvation, when the whole universe awaited him? He pushed himself up,\r\naway from her; he heard her voice as if from a great distance, making\r\nwords, but he was past words.\r\n\r\nBlackness closed in about them; time slowed, the eddies of air swirled\r\nto a halt, and lances of fire swirled through his mind. Then, beyond\r\nthe realm of three dimensions he _saw_ her, clearly.\r\n\r\nHis mind shattered into a thousand crystals, reflecting prismatically\r\npounding emotions he could not directly face. He looked at Fran, into\r\nher, through her, beyond her.\r\n\r\nHe saw; not the immobilized figure of a frightened woman, her body\r\nhelpless beneath his own on the sofa. In fact, he saw not even the sofa.\r\n\r\nHe saw; beyond the immediacy of the fields of motion contained\r\nin finite space as his body, he comprehended other patterns of\r\nsub-atomic flux. Below him was a geometrically ordered matrix, a\r\nprecise framework simply constructed. But above it he found an area\r\nof disorder. Complexity, confusion, patterns and sub-patterns of a\r\nstructure so immensely varied and subtly differentiated as to be nearly\r\nincomprehensible. The motion! 

=== Chunk 9 ===
Movement! _Life!_\r\n\r\nIt offended him. It was vulgar, teeming, unruly, impossible! He began\r\nto reach out to it....\r\n\r\n"MAX!"\r\n\r\nA body had flung itself at him, kicking, scratching, screaming. He\r\nwas toppled back and suddenly lying on the floor, back in the narrow\r\nconfines of a single body again. His head rang and her words were\r\nslowly becoming words again.\r\n\r\nThey hurt his ears, jangling with their ridiculous cadences against the\r\nsublime expanse of perception. "No, _no_! I loved you, but you--you\'re\r\nmad--you\'re not Max--"\r\n\r\nAnd then she had flung herself through the door and was gone, her\r\nrunning footsteps growing fainter on the stairs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSlowly, Max surrendered himself to a chair, without any awareness of\r\nhis human motions. The old chair enveloped him with the old overstuffed\r\ncushioned arms and gave him a musty embrace and for a moment he was\r\npart of all its enfolding past, the weariness that had come into its\r\nunrejecting depths for comfort and rest. His face was still wet with\r\nthe tears he had shed before, and now they began to swell and flow\r\nagain, erupting and cascading almost without volition.\r\n\r\nFran was gone.\r\n\r\nShe was gone, and she had been all he had, all that was ever really\r\nreal to him. Dimly he sensed, without knowing, that it had been a\r\ndouble failure. Fran had refused, rejected his need--but was it Fran\'s\r\nfault, that he had been unable to reach her? Had he ever been able to\r\nreach any human creature? Had he ever _wanted_ to, except in his own\r\nselfish desire? He spoke of loving Fran, and yet he had shied away from\r\nthat answer--until he needed her.\r\n\r\nAnd so his vast paranormal powers were meaningless, because the\r\nphysical universe itself was without meaning. Ordered, yes. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
Finely\r\nstructured. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
But with no more meaning than an alarm clock. He could be\r\nGod, and yet the only safety and sanity he had felt was when Fran drew\r\nhim back from the brink of the bewildering nothingness into the shelter\r\nof her breast.\r\n\r\nBut for all his control of _things_, he had been unable to achieve\r\nthat blending that meant power. He had only a meaningless power over\r\nthings which now, in essence, were only nothingness in various rates of\r\nflow....\r\n\r\nThe sun had set and he had turned none of the lights on. The gloom\r\nof dusk settled, blanketing his body with darkness and his mind with\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\nIf Fran--If. A meaningless word now. If Fran had only accepted him--if\r\nhe could control his own emotions as easily as the magic-show flames\r\nhe had donned! But he had feared to surrender himself to any emotion,\r\nhe had given too little of himself to Fran--and when the moment of his\r\nneed came, she had nothing of him that could call him back safe from\r\nthe borderland of bleak despair.\r\n\r\nHe wasn\'t fit. Like a baby given a straight razor, he could not cope\r\nwith his gift, and the outcome was inevitable. There was only one\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nBest do it now.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuddenly the darkness was pierced by flames, a flickering, growing fire\r\nwhich enveloped and covered his body. His clothes vanished in a flare\r\nof flame, spreading to and attacking the soft upholstery of the chair.\r\n\r\nA small thing to salvage, his ego. But this was the grandiose way, the\r\n_big_ way--for the big failure.\r\n\r\nHe sat for long moments, crowned in golden flames, lost in\r\ncontemplation of the streams of superheated glowing ions radiated from\r\nthe burning carbon. Then the chair shifted as cloth burned through,\r\nfibre straps released their hold on the metal springs of the seat.\r\n\r\nTime.\r\n\r\nDeliberately, without emotion, he released his hold on the lines of\r\nforce which demarcated the limits of his body.\r\n\r\nHis hair vanished instantly in a shower of sparks and simultaneously\r\na furnace blast beat in on him. Then his skin was blistering and\r\nblackening; gone. He collapsed into his funeral pyre, flinging out\r\nlimbs in reflex spasm and struggle, and he was....\r\n\r\nHe lived. He was aware. He was everything in his world and still\r\nnothing; streams of force, patterns of sub-atomic flux. He was a moment\r\nwhen all fear and all perception had vanished, blending into a gestalt\r\nthat was more than himself....\r\n\r\nIn her uneasy sleep, Francine floated five inches above the surface of\r\nher bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
