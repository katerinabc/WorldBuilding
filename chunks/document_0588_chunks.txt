=== Chunk 2 ===
So you ask for your life. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
But wait! Are\r\n    you sure that\'s really what you want above all else?_\r\n\r\n\r\nAndy Larson was a hard-headed Swede. He had to be, to be still alive. He\r\nhadn\'t been able to move anything but that hard head for what he\r\nestimated to be about three hours since he regained consciousness. And\r\nin that time he hadn\'t heard anything that led him to believe anyone\r\nelse had survived the crash.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hurt and helpless, Larson waited for death.]\r\n\r\nThe only thing Andy Larson had heard was the water and the far-away\r\nwhine of the patrol ship on its grid track search pattern. It had not\r\nreached his area yet, and he wasn\'t at all excited about his chances of\r\nbeing spotted when it did get nearer. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
He could turn his head, and he\r\ncould see the tangled interlacing of tree branches and vines above and\r\naround him. He remembered, at the first moment of impact, just before\r\nthe ship began to break apart, a tremendous geyser of mud and water. The\r\npicture was indelibly imprinted on his mind. He couldn\'t see the water\r\nnow, but he could hear it. The litter he could see by twisting his head\r\nas far to the left as it would go told him they had crash-landed on the\r\nwater--a river by the sound of it--and had skipped drunkenly, in\r\nsomething approximating flat stone fashion, into the forest lining the\r\nriver\'s bank. There had been no explosion and no fire, there was no wide\r\nswath cut through the trees--and therefore no reason why he should\r\nassume the patrol would spot him. There might be pieces of the ship\r\nlying where the patrol could see them. But he doubted that, for the\r\nriver was deep and the vegetation was thick.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe strained his ears, not to hear if the patrol was approaching closer,\r\nbut listening for the sound of life around him. This was his one\r\nhope--another survivor, and of necessity a mobile one. Someone to shout\r\nand wave, to climb a tree, to find an open space and build a fire, to\r\nlight a flare, to do something--anything--that would attract the\r\npatrol\'s attention. Andy Larson wasn\'t afraid of dying. He felt no\r\npanic, no agonies of conscience, remorse or bitterness at the apparent\r\ninevitability of the prospect before him. But if he was not destined to\r\ndie he needed a miracle or the assistance of that almost impossible--but\r\nonly almost--survivor. And instead of praying for the miracle, he\r\nlistened with all the hearing power at his command for the sound of\r\nhuman life. That would be miracle enough, and he didn\'t intend to stop\r\nlistening until he couldn\'t any more.\r\n\r\nNot that he didn\'t pray at all; back home in New Jersey, while not\r\nconsidered a pillar of the church, Andy Larson was known as a good,\r\npracticing Lutheran. But it was doubtful if the Lutherans, or any other\r\nsect for that matter, had sent missionaries this high into the heavens\r\nyet; the misbegotten flight he had been on had been only the fourth to\r\nreach this strange little planet of Abernathy since its discovery by the\r\ngood professor back in \'92. So Andy was no longer a practicing Lutheran,\r\nif practicing meant going to church. But he had prayed more than once\r\nduring the long outward journey. And he was praying now, while his ears\r\nstrained for sounds and his eyes strained for movement; praying for\r\nhimself, yes, but even more for his wife, and for someone he had never\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nHe couldn\'t help being afraid for Elsie; he had been gone from home\r\nalmost seven months, and she had been rocked with morning sickness for\r\nthe last three weeks before he left, moaning over her saltines and\r\nbegging him not to go even though she knew he couldn\'t and would not\r\nback out. She was afraid of the unknown he was going into, and he was\r\nafraid of the unknown that awaited her--it was the first time for both\r\nunknowns for both of them.\r\n\r\nIn a little while he could stop straining his eyes. Greenish dusk was\r\nslipping into night. Soon his ears would have to do all the work. The\r\nthought of night-prowling creatures disturbed him somewhat; no-one knew\r\nfor sure yet what, if anything, lived in these thick, isolated jungles.\r\nParalyzed as he was, he was fair game--his choice of words in the\r\nthought brought a grimacing smile to his face. He tried once again--was\r\nit the thousandth time yet?--to move his arms, his legs, his hands, a\r\nfinger, a toe. Earlier, he had thought he was moving the big toe on his\r\nleft foot, but he couldn\'t raise his head to see past the twisted bulk\r\nof metal that lay across him, the toe had nothing to rub upon to give it\r\nfeeling, and there was absolutely no feeling between it and his head to\r\ngive it any meaning anyhow. But it would have been a nice feeling just\r\nto know it was still there.\r\n\r\nHe gave up the attempt when sweat beaded out on his forehead and went\r\nback to listening and praying. He was tempted to pray for the miracle\r\nnow, for blackness blotted out even the pitiful remains of the ship, and\r\nthe whine of the patrol had muted to a singing hum in the distance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe night turned cold and damp, but Andy Larson, in his sheathing of\r\nparalysis, didn\'t feel it. The loneliness was on him, the awesome\r\nloneliness of having to wait for death alone, with no warm hand to hold\r\non to until the parting. He still felt no great fear or bitterness. Only\r\nthe loneliness, and sadness. He would never know his son, or daughter,\r\nwould never know that it loved him, that he was the biggest thing in its\r\nlife. And it--that was ugly; he would call it "he"; if he had a choice a\r\nson it would be--he, his son, would never know his father, or how much\r\nhis father wanted to love him. And Elsie--how lonely it would be for\r\nher. Her time must be getting close now, and she would be frightened.\r\nThe doctor hadn\'t told her what he had told him--that she was too\r\nslight, definitely not built for child-bearing. But she knew. And she\r\nwould be brave, but frightened and alone.\r\n\r\nThe hours of night trudged by. The few stars that peeped through the\r\ntrees were no help in telling the time, and Andy had lost interest in it\r\nanyhow. It was night, it had been night for what seemed like years,\r\nthe blackness around him proclaimed it would be night still for many\r\nmore years. He dozed off and on, at times waking with a start, thinking\r\nhe had heard something. For a few minutes he would listen intently,\r\nfeverishly. But when nothing reached his ears but the little night\r\nsounds he had become accustomed to, he would sink back into the lethargy\r\nthat weighed upon his eyelids.\r\n\r\nHe wondered if he could be dying. He thought he was getting weaker--but\r\nhow could he tell for sure? He could feel nothing, there was no pain, no\r\nmuscular failure, no falling weakly to the ground. There were no muscles\r\nleft and he was on the ground already. It was a Herculean effort to keep\r\nhis eyes open, to listen as he had vowed he would. But that might be\r\nonly fatigue, the need for sleep. And shock! 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Of course. He had to be\r\nsuffering from shock, and from exposure, too. So if he didn\'t die of\r\nstarvation, and if some beast didn\'t devour him, and if whatever wounds\r\nand injuries he had didn\'t do him in, he would probably die anyhow from\r\npneumonia.\r\n\r\nThe thought was almost a comforting one. It took him off the hook,\r\nunburdened him of the need to worry about whether or not he lived. The\r\nthing was out of his hands, and no stubbornness on his part was going to\r\ndo any good. He had prayed himself out before, prayed until the words of\r\nthe prayers were nothing but imbecilic mutterings and mumblings,\r\nmeaningless monosyllables swirling pointlessly and endlessly through his\r\ntired brain. The thing was out of his hands. He--Andy Larson--he gave\r\nup. He quit. He was nothing but a head that was hard and a body that was\r\ndead. What right did he have thinking he had any control over what\r\nhappened to him? He was incapable of doing anything himself--he had to\r\nwait until something happened to him. And he knew what was going to\r\nhappen. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
So that\'s what he\'d do. He\'d just wait.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe closed his eyes and saw Elsie, and before he realized he was going to\r\ndo it he was praying again, talking to God about Elsie, and then talking\r\nto Elsie about God, and then back to God again and to Elsie again, and\r\nhe knew he was crying because he could taste the tears, and he knew he\r\nwas going to die because there wasn\'t anything else that could happen,\r\nand he knew suddenly that he was mortally afraid. He could not lay\r\nrigidly, tensely--there were no muscles to tighten. But the tension had\r\nto go somewhere. He felt a numbness creeping up the back of his neck,\r\nfelt his eyes bulging as if they would burst, heard a roaring in his\r\nears. He opened his mouth, gasping, trying to breathe deeply, the\r\nroaring in his ears reaching a crescendo and then breaking into a cold\r\nsighing wind that loudened and softened with the regularity of a pulse\r\nbeat. He didn\'t know if he was awake or sleeping, dozing or dreaming,\r\ndying or dead. But he heard Elsie.\r\n\r\nShe was calling him. Over the cold black nothingness that separated them\r\nshe was calling his name, her voice riding on the mournful wind sighing\r\nin his ears. He could hear her--it was as simple as that. He still\r\ndidn\'t know if he was dreaming or dead. He didn\'t care. She was calling\r\nto him and he could hear, and although it wasn\'t the miracle he had\r\nwanted to pray for, still it was a miracle. He didn\'t question it; the\r\ncomfort of hearing her voice after the terrible loneliness was enough.\r\nHe didn\'t wonder how it could happen, didn\'t doubt that she could hear\r\nhim answering her, as he was doing now. At first, so overcome with joy\r\nand relief, so thankful for the miracle, he didn\'t even recognize the\r\ntones of pain in her voice.\r\n\r\n"Elsie, Elsie, Elsie," he cried out with his mind, reaching for her,\r\nwanting to seize her and hold her and never let her slip away again. "I\r\nhear you, my darling. I hear you!"\r\n\r\n"Thank God!" Her voice broke, and the sound of sobbing carried on the\r\nwind reached his ears. For a moment it puzzled him. He had been crying,\r\nbut her sobs were something different. The night suddenly seemed to turn\r\nmuch colder. "What is it, Elsie?" he called in fright.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe sobbing became a choking cough. He heard her grunt and gasp, and\r\nthen a small scream turned his blood into ice. After a long moment she\r\nspoke again, panting, her voice strained and scratchy. "Thank God you\r\ncan hear me, Andy. I\'ve called and called. I prayed that I didn\'t care\r\nwhat happened, just so long as you could be with me. And you are, you\r\nare. It\'s a miracle and I don\'t know how. But you\'re with me and I\r\nwon\'t be afraid any more. I won\'t ... oh ... oh ..."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAndy suddenly understood. "Elsie," he cried frantically. "Where are you?\r\nAre you in the hospital? Is everything all right? Is the doctor there?\r\n_Elsie!_" He shouted her name aloud, angrily, trying to force it through\r\nthe immense absorbent space between them, cursing and screaming at his\r\nown helplessness.\r\n\r\n"Be quiet, Andy," she said at last. "Stop carrying on so. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
I\'m all right\r\nnow--it\'s just that the pain comes and sometimes I don\'t know what to\r\ndo."\r\n\r\n"But are you all right? Did the doctor--?"\r\n\r\n"Shhh, Andy. Of course I\'m all right. I\'m in the labor room and there\r\nare lots of nice people to take care of me. Dr. Bell says it\'s like this\r\noften with first babies. And since I\'m smaller than I should be--that\r\ndoesn\'t help any. But I\'m going to be all right."\r\n\r\n"You called me, though. You said you were afraid of something, and\r\nprayed that--"\r\n\r\n"You know how big a sissy I can be sometimes, Andy. Remember the time\r\nthe wasp got in the bathroom while I was taking a shower, and how we\r\ngot tangled up in the shower curtain where I was trying to hide from him\r\nand you were trying to catch him? And remember what happened right after\r\nthat? 

=== Chunk 8 ===
Right there in the bathroom?" She laughed lightly.\r\n\r\nTo hear her laugh again! Andy smiled to himself, remembering. She had\r\nbeen so soft and cool and pretty, snarled in the shower curtain, her\r\nhair damp and curly, her cheeks flushed, uttering little squeals and\r\nyelps and giggles that were exciting music, and suddenly he wasn\'t\r\nchasing the wasp any more and she wasn\'t giggling because the wasp was\r\ntickling her. She had pulled his head under the shower, and he had got\r\nsoaked anyway, so he climbed into the tub and she helped pull off his\r\nclothes and they soaped each other into a lather and they rinsed and\r\nthey climbed out together, but they never got dried off and they never\r\ngot out of the bathroom--at least not for a long time. And oh, how her\r\nlaugh had tinkled then, and how he loved her when she laughed.\r\n\r\nHe thought of her laughing now, and a pain shot through his head. He\r\ntried to visualize her now, as she laughed--the swollen, hurt-looking\r\nbelly, the heavy breasts dragging her frail shoulders forward, the\r\ndrawn, pinched look he knew must be between her eyes as it was always\r\nwhen she felt unwell. He could visualize her this way, but not laughing.\r\nThen he heard her, and she wasn\'t laughing any more, and her moans were\r\nneedles and her screams were knives.\r\n\r\nIt lasted longer this time. It lasted so long he could taste the blood\r\nwhere his teeth had ground through his lip, although he couldn\'t\r\nremember the pain of doing it. She came back to him at last, groaning\r\nweakly, and they talked, he cheerfully for her sake, she bravely for\r\nhis. They remembered things they had done together, good times, happy\r\ntimes. They talked of what they would do when he came home, and what\r\nwould they call the baby? Andy Junior if a boy? Elsie if a girl? Or\r\nKaren, or Mary, or Kirsten, or maybe Hermione? They laughed at that, and\r\nthey laughed again at the thought of twins. But the laughs turned into\r\ngasps and cries of pain. And Elsie lay thrashing in the labor room of a\r\nhospital in New Jersey, and Andy lay rigidly under a rigidity not of\r\nhis own making in a jungle far away.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShe came back to him and told him the doctors had had a consultation,\r\nand had agreed to wait a little longer. She came back and told him they\r\nhad decided they could not wait much longer, and would have to undertake\r\na Caesarean. She came back and told him she had begged them to give her\r\na little more time to try and do it herself, but she was afraid they\r\nwere going to give her something to knock her out. She came and she\r\nwent, but even when she was gone she was never so far away that Andy\r\ncould not hear her. He wanted to stop his ears to the hysterical\r\noutpourings, but he was helpless, and he hated himself for wanting to.\r\n\r\nWhen she came back the next time, with weakness turning her voice into a\r\nhoarse whisper, he begged her to take the drugs. But she wasn\'t\r\nlistening to him. "Andy, Andy," she said, "listen to me please. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
It\'s\r\nimportant. They\'ve decided on the Caesarean, and I haven\'t got much\r\ntime. I\'ve been thinking of the way we\'ve been talking, and I think it\r\nhappened because I needed you so much. That\'s how I got all the way to\r\nwhere you are. I needed you with me with every part of me, and somehow\r\npart of me found you. But Andy, you must have needed me, too. You must\r\nhave needed me, Andy, or how did you get back to me?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDespite the weakness of her voice, the fear in it rang out loudly. He\r\ntried to laugh and told her he was perfectly fine, except for worry\r\nabout her. He made up a story about lying on his bunk, sipping a cool\r\nlemonade and listening to soft music, trying to calm his nerves over the\r\nprospect of becoming a new father and wondering where he would get the\r\ncigars to distribute to the boys.\r\n\r\nBut she wouldn\'t believe him. She insisted that he tell her the truth,\r\npleading with him, crying out her love and her fear and her need. At\r\nlast he told her of the crash, speaking lightly, pointing out that the\r\npatrol ship would be back with daylight and all would be well. He didn\'t\r\nmention the fact that he had no body below the neck, but he knew she\r\nknew it was worse than he described.\r\n\r\nThen she was gone again, for so long a time he thought the operation had\r\nstarted. But the wind still blew raggedly in his ears, and she came\r\nback, slowly, but with new vibrancy in her voice. "Andy, you dope," she\r\nwhispered with a brave attempt at sprightliness. "Why didn\'t\r\nyou--tell--me--sooner?" She was gasping, but hurried on. "I can tell the\r\ndoctor, and he can telephone somebody and they can use the radio and\r\ntell the patrol where you are. Oh! 

=== Chunk 10 ===
Andy--where are you--? Hurry--"\r\n\r\nShe was going again, and as quickly as he could he told her of the river\r\nand the jungle, and where approximately the ship had been just before\r\nthe crash. Then she was gone and he closed his eyes and let the waves of\r\nnear-hysterical relief wash over him. He was exhausted, the strain of\r\nlong concentration had drained his strength, but he could almost feel\r\nthe nerve ends in his dead body tingling with the exhilaration that sang\r\nin his mind. It was the miracle he hadn\'t dared pray for. It would be\r\nthe greatest miracle ever performed, and he had almost lost it, almost\r\nkilled it, almost thrown it away. But Elsie-- He prayed feverishly now,\r\nthanking, thanking, and praying for the miracle to really happen and for\r\nElsie and his son to be all right.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen the wind was roaring blackly in his ears and the wind was turning\r\ninto a shrieking demon and above it he could hear her wild scream: "They\r\ndon\'t believe me! They say I\'m delirious. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
Andy! They\'re coming with\r\nsomething to put me to sleep. They don\'t believe me, Andy ..."\r\n\r\nIt ended. The wind stopped abruptly with her voice. The only things Andy\r\nLarson could hear were the blood pounding in his head and the grating of\r\ninsects singing their last to the approaching dawn. It was all over, and\r\nhe closed his eyes to the lightening sky. It was all over, the miracle\r\nwas dead, the miracle never was, he was dead, he never was. Elsie-- He\r\nrocked his head back and forth, wanting to cry, to curse and shout out\r\nhis hatred of life. But nothing would come out, nothing was left.\r\n\r\nIt was all over. He lay under his memorial, a junk pile of twisted\r\nmetal, inching his way toward death, the abortion of an abortive\r\nmiracle, alone, tearless, wifeless, sonless, helpless.\r\n\r\nA faint hum drifted to his ears. He looked up, wondering that the dawn\r\nhad come so soon. The sky was brilliant with light, but still he could\r\nnot see the patrol ship, knew that it couldn\'t see him, no matter how\r\nclose the hum got.\r\n\r\nThe hum came closer and closer, grew louder, and then he heard her soft\r\nlaugh and the hum faded away.\r\n\r\n"Andy? Aren\'t you coming?"\r\n\r\nHe stared at the sky, his eyes bulging, his tongue swollen in his\r\nthroat. He couldn\'t see anything, the light was so bright. He thought he\r\nmust be dreaming--he had heard that people had strange visions when they\r\nwere dying. But her voice sounded so real.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t worry, honey," she said softly. "Everything is all right now.\r\nCome on, we\'re waiting."\r\n\r\nHe strained his eyes to see, and the phrase _we\'re waiting_ struck him\r\njust as the other voice let out a cry.\r\n\r\n"What--?" he mumbled, stupidly, happily, afraid to believe.\r\n\r\nShe laughed again, and little pieces of glittering silver tinkled\r\nthrough the gold of the sky. "I guess we\'ll have to call him Andy,\r\nafter his father. He was a slow-poke too."\r\n\r\nShe was there beside him now--or he was beside her--he didn\'t know\r\nwhich, for he was suddenly free of the great weight that held him down,\r\nhe had the sensation of floating lightly through the air. But they were\r\ntogether and she was radiant, and he was happier than he had ever\r\nthought he could be, even though she couldn\'t put her arms around him as\r\nhe wanted her to because her arms were full of his son. His arms\r\nweren\'t full--only his eyes and his throat and his heart--and he put\r\nthem around her, holding her tightly.\r\n\r\nThe baby howled a protest, and Elsie, laughed her wonderful laugh again.\r\n"He has a good voice, Andy, don\'t you think?"\r\n\r\n"A lovely voice," Andy agreed, and his own voice sounded to him as if he\r\nwere singing.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ December 1957.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.
