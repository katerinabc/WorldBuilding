Now the\r\n            whole galaxy was his if he could remember to--\r\n\r\n                         Never Trust A Thief!\r\n\r\n                           By Ivar Jorgensen\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Imagination Stories of Science and Fantasy\r\n                             February 1958\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nKiley took one last, fond look at the glittering heap of jewels in the\r\nback of the spaceship, nodded happily to himself, and began to set up\r\na blastoff orbit. Somewhere down on the field far below, he could see\r\ndot-like figures--spaceport attendants, all firmly convinced that this\r\nwas an authorized flight.\r\n\r\nHe chuckled. _This is the right way to pull a job_, he thought\r\ncontentedly. _Hypnotize \'em silly and then walk in and take what you\r\nwant._\r\n\r\nHis fingers skipped lightly over the control panel as he readied the\r\nship for blastoff. For the first time in his life he felt truly happy.\r\nTwo million stellors of rare gems in the back of the ship, and even\r\nafter cutting Thaklaru in for his share, that still left a million. A\r\nmillion stellors! Lord, that sounded good!\r\n\r\n_Well, Kiley, are you going to spend all day dreaming? I\'m waiting for\r\nyou!_\r\n\r\nThe rolling thunder of Thaklaru\'s voice in Kiley\'s mind jolted him back\r\nto reality. "I\'m on my way," he said out loud, knowing that the alien\r\nwas listening. "I\'ve got the stuff, and I\'ll be there before you know\r\nit."\r\n\r\n_Good. I\'m anxious to see those jewels._\r\n\r\n"Don\'t worry about it, Thaklaru."\r\n\r\n_I\'m not worrying. But I know you\'d be quite willing to blast off in\r\nthe other direction and keep them all for yourself._\r\n\r\nKiley grinned. "Nothing\'s secret from you, eh, Thaklaru? 

=== Chunk 2 ===
You don\'t miss\r\na thing."\r\n\r\n_I can\'t afford to_, the alien\'s telepathic voice said. _The first rule\r\nin thievery is never to trust an accomplice._\r\n\r\n"That makes sense," Kiley admitted. "Only there\'s no way I can escape\r\nyou--not when you can telepath anywhere in the galaxy. How do I get to\r\nyour planet?"\r\n\r\n_Don\'t trouble yourself. Simply blast off and I\'ll assume mental\r\ncontrol of your ship once you\'re out in space. I\'d prefer that the\r\nlocation of my world remain a secret even to you._\r\n\r\nKiley shrugged. "Okay. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
I won\'t argue. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
I\'m blasting off now."\r\n\r\nHe jabbed down on the firing stud.\r\n\r\nThe stolen spaceship sprang up into the void, and Kiley felt the\r\nalien\'s mental emanations enfolding him, seizing control of the ship,\r\nguiding it--just as, a month before, similar emanations had come to\r\nhim in the darkness of a jail cell in the Under-Dungeon of Alpheraz VII.\r\n\r\nThey had nailed him for a bungled burglary--he\'d have made it, all\r\nright, except that he hadn\'t foreseen one of the new-model psionic\r\nalarms--and, since he was a four-timer, they\'d stuck him in solitary\r\ndeep in the dank heart of the planet.\r\n\r\nThe guard, a thick-muscled Alpherazian with three cold, slitted eyes,\r\nhad hurled him into the cell, thrown him sprawling against the slimy\r\nstone.\r\n\r\n"That ought to hold you, Kiley!" the Alpherazian growled. "You\'ve\r\nstolen your last jewel, Earthman."\r\n\r\n"Get out of here!" Kiley said thinly. "Don\'t stand here and gloat. I\'d\r\nbe free and out of here if that crazy alarm hadn\'t popped off."\r\n\r\nThe guard chuckled. "Relax and cool off, Kiley. You\'ve got plenty of\r\ntime to get used to your new home."\r\n\r\nThe door clanged shut. Kiley spat in the darkness as he heard the bolt\r\nslipping home--the unbreakable, foolproof bolt of the escape proof\r\nAlpheraz jail. And then--\r\n\r\n_How would you like to be free in five minutes?_ a voice asked.\r\n\r\n"Huh? Who\'s there?" Kiley looked around, narrowing his eyes to see in\r\nthe foggy blackness, but there was no one within sight.\r\n\r\n_Don\'t strain your eyes_, the voice said--and Kiley realized it was an\r\nunspoken voice in his mind. _I\'m a thousand light-years away. The name\r\nis Thaklaru._\r\n\r\n"Who are you? _What_ are you?

=== Chunk 5 ===
"\r\n\r\n_That doesn\'t concern you. I need your professional services, and I\r\nhave a proposition to make._\r\n\r\n"Go ahead," Kiley said, mystified.\r\n\r\n_You\'re a jewel-thief--and a good one. I can aid you in such a way that\r\nyou\'ll be a perfect one._\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n_How would you like the power of instant hypnosis?_ the alien asked.\r\n_You could go anywhere you liked--simply by convincing people you\r\nbelonged there. My mind, projected out through the focus of yours,\r\ncould do this thing. We could work as partners, and divide fifty-fifty._\r\n\r\n"Hold on," said Kiley suspiciously. "What do you need _me_ for, then?\r\nIf you\'ve got this power, why not just rob whatever you want yourself?"\r\n\r\nThere was the voiceless equivalent of a chuckle. _I do not like to\r\nleave my home world. You will act as my travelling--ah--agent._\r\n\r\n"Sounds good to me," Kiley said. "I\'ve got nothing to lose, anyway. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
But\r\nhow do I get out of here?"\r\n\r\n_A simple matter. Just be patient._\r\n\r\nKiley waited. A few minutes later, the Alpherazian jailer showed\r\nup--but the look of scorn was gone from his eyes.\r\n\r\n"Dreadfully sorry, Mr. Smith," the guard said humbly. "There\'s been\r\nsome mistake here--we thought you were someone else. Naturally, we\'ll\r\nindemnify you for this inconvenience."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all right," Kiley said casually. "Mistakes _do_ happen, you\r\nknow."\r\n\r\n"This way, please. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
We\'re terribly sorry about the whole affair."\r\n\r\nKiley smiled as the guard led him out of the cell-block to freedom.\r\n_You\'re a man of your word, Thaklaru_, he thought. _It\'s a deal._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOnce free, Kiley had spent a very pleasant three weeks on Alpheraz\r\nVII. Thaklaru\'s mind was with him at all times--and with his power of\r\ninstant hypnosis, all doors were open to him. It was a simple matter.\r\n\r\nThe big coup came when Kiley grew tired of the planet\'s pleasures. He\r\ntravelled to the Emperor\'s palace.\r\n\r\nThe guards bowed to him as he approached. "Good afternoon, your\r\nmajesty!"\r\n\r\nKiley smiled politely and kept on going. He walked quickly through the\r\npalace, stopping only to ask a butler where the jewel-room was.\r\n\r\nAs it turned out, the Emperor himself was in the jewel-room. "Pardon\r\nme, your majesty," Kiley said. "I\'ll have to have some of these, I\'m\r\nafraid."\r\n\r\nThe monarch looked up, met Kiley\'s eye, and froze. "Of course," he\r\nsaid politely. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
"Go right ahead." And he stood to one side while Kiley\r\nplundered the crown jewels.\r\n\r\nFrom there, he travelled to the spaceport outside the city, where he\r\ncommandeered a small one-man ship by asking its pilot to leave. Guided\r\nby Thaklaru, he arranged for clearance and blasted off.\r\n\r\nIt had been simple. Terribly, terribly simple--almost dull, Kiley\r\nreflected, as his ship sped through space toward Thaklaru\'s home world.\r\nHe wondered idly what his partner-in-crime looked like. A grotesque\r\npulsating slug floating in a bath of some slimy fluid, perhaps? It\r\nwould have to be something along those lines, Kiley thought--something\r\nthat would keep Thaklaru from entering the worlds of the galaxy by\r\nhimself and taking whatever he pleased.\r\n\r\n"We make a good team, Thaklaru," Kiley said aloud.\r\n\r\n_True_, the alien said. _With my power and your agility, we could steal\r\nanything the galaxy contained._\r\n\r\nKiley turned and looked at the heap of jewels again. Two million\r\nstellors! Quickly, he computed the value in Earth currency, and gasped.\r\nThe haul was worth nearly ten billion dollars!\r\n\r\nPerspiration broke out all over him. He tried frantically not to think\r\nwhat he was thinking, but there was no way to keep the thoughts from\r\nflooding into his mind.\r\n\r\nHe heard Thaklaru chuckling. _No, Kiley. There\'s no way you can cheat\r\nme of my share of the wealth._\r\n\r\n"Dammit, Thaklaru, do you have to keep listening to my mind? Can\'t I\r\nhave a _little_ privacy?"\r\n\r\n_Don\'t fear, Kiley. Your reaction is a perfectly understandable one,\r\nand I hold no rancor against you for desiring great wealth. I expect\r\nyou to think that way--which is why I keep listening to you. I never\r\ntrust an accomplice, remember._\r\n\r\nA new thought entered Kiley\'s mind. "Say--what do you _need_ these\r\njewels for? Seems to me you could have anything you wanted, money no\r\nobject--so why do you want to be rich?"\r\n\r\n_Rich? I do not want to be rich. The jewels are pretty, though--and I\r\nlike beautiful things. I covet them for purely esthetic reasons._\r\n\r\n"Okay with me," Kiley said. "I have more practical ends in mind.

=== Chunk 9 ===
"\r\n\r\n_It is understandable. Ah--you are approaching my home world now.\r\nPlease prepare for deceleration._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn hour later, Kiley stood on the soil of Thaklaru\'s planet and looked\r\naround.\r\n\r\n_Welcome_, the alien\'s voice said.\r\n\r\nKiley stood by the side of his spaceship and stared at the awesome\r\nsight. A vast chain of naked mountains sprang up like a row of\r\ngigantic teeth to the east--bare, jagged peaks stretching up into dim\r\nimmensity, twenty and thirty and forty thousand feet in air. Wild\r\nsavage-looking vegetation swept fiercely around him, trees well over a\r\nthousand feet high and looking to be a block wide at their base. Just\r\nat a distance of a few feet, a monstrous cliff reared straight upward\r\ntoward the swirling black-and-gold clouds. It was a strange and utterly\r\nprimitive world.\r\n\r\n"Okay, I\'m here!" Kiley shouted. "Where are you?"\r\n\r\n_I will be with you soon_, the alien responded. _Take the jewels from\r\nthe ship._\r\n\r\n"How do I decide which are yours and which are mine?"\r\n\r\n_Take them all. We will decide once they are out of the ship._\r\n\r\nA sudden ripple of terror ran through Kiley, turning the little\r\njewel-thief cold. He felt dwarfed by the sheer magnitude of Thaklaru\'s\r\nworld. He wondered where the alien was, what sort of creature he might\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n_Your curiosity will soon be ended_, Thaklaru said. _When you have\r\nbrought the jewels out, I will appear._\r\n\r\nKiley shrugged and started to climb the catwalk that led into the ship.\r\nThere was little sense in trying to argue with Thaklaru\'s abilities;\r\nif he didn\'t go willingly, the alien would only force him. He gathered\r\nthe jewels into a double handful and brought them back outside,\r\ndropping them onto a bare patch of reddish-green soil. Returning, he\r\nbrought the rest of them out.\r\n\r\n"Okay," he said. "They\'re all there."\r\n\r\n_Good. They are lovely._\r\n\r\n"Suppose you show up and let\'s divide these things," Kiley said. "I\'m\r\ntired of your mental voice--let\'s hear the real thing."\r\n\r\n_Very well._\r\n\r\nA clap of thunder seemed to split the sky--a deafening, booming noise\r\nthat made the ground quiver. Kiley cowered in fright as the sound was\r\nrepeated--and this time, he was able to detect words.\r\n\r\n"I am Thaklaru!"\r\n\r\n"Where are you?"\r\n\r\n"Look upward!" the booming voice cried.\r\n\r\nHesitantly, Kiley turned his gaze upward--and gasped. The "cliff" he\r\nhad thought stood next to him was no cliff at all. It was a vast alien\r\ncreature, stony and terrifying, whose head vanished in the fuzzy clouds\r\nfar overhead.\r\n\r\nAgain came the booming noise: "I am Thaklaru!"\r\n\r\n"I see why you needed an accomplice," Kiley said in a weak voice.\r\n"Something--someone of your size--"\r\n\r\n"Yes. I could never venture into anything as tiny as one of your\r\ncities."\r\n\r\nKiley licked his lips nervously. "Well--here are the jewels.\r\nLet\'s--let\'s divide them!"\r\n\r\n"One bit of business first," the alien\'s thunderous boom came. "You\r\nhave served well--but you cannot live."\r\n\r\n"_What?_"\r\n\r\n"It is necessary, Kiley. There are ways of extracting information from\r\na man\'s subconscious--and I would not have my existence known."\r\n\r\nSuddenly the sky was black. Kiley looked up and saw what could only be\r\na foot--a monstrous, horrible foot--blotting out the sunlight overhead.\r\n\r\n"I warned you, Kiley--never trust an accomplice. And _I_ was your\r\naccomplice."\r\n\r\nThe sky rang with the gigantic alien\'s cosmic laughter. Kiley covered\r\nhis ears to blot out the hideous sound. Tears of rage flooded his eyes.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not fair! It\'s--"\r\n\r\n"Sorry, Kiley."\r\n\r\n_Like an ant_, the thief thought bitterly. _I\'m dying like an ant._\r\n\r\nAnd then the great foot came down.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
