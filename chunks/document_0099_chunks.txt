Behind the desk the doctor\r\nsmiled down at James Wheatley through thick glasses.

"Now, then!

What\r\nseems to be the trouble?"\r\n\r\nWheatley had been palpitating for five days straight at the prospect of\r\ncoming here. "I know it\'s silly," he said. "But I\'ve been having a pain\r\nin my toe."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!" said the doctor. "Well, now! How long have you had this pain,\r\nmy man?"\r\n\r\n"About six months now, I\'d say. Just now and then, you know. It\'s never\r\nreally been bad. Until last week. You see--"\r\n\r\n"I see," said the doctor. "Getting worse all the time, you say."\r\n\r\nWheatley wiggled the painful toe reflectively. "Well--you might say\r\nthat. You see, when I first--"\r\n\r\n"How old did you say you were, Mr. Wheatley?"\r\n\r\n"Fifty-five."\r\n\r\n"Fifty-_five_!" The doctor leafed through the medical record on his\r\ndesk. "But this is incredible. You haven\'t had a checkup in almost ten\r\nyears!"\r\n\r\n"I guess I haven\'t," said Wheatley, apologetically. "I\'d been feeling\r\npretty well until--"\r\n\r\n"_Feeling_ well!" The doctor stared in horror. "But my dear fellow, no\r\ncheckup since January 1963! We aren\'t in the Middle Ages, you know. This\r\nis 1972."\r\n\r\n"Well, of course--"\r\n\r\n"Of course you may be _feeling_ well enough, but that doesn\'t mean\r\neverything is just the way it should be. And now, you see, you\'re having\r\npains in your toes!"\r\n\r\n"One toe," said Wheatley. "The little one on the right. It seemed to\r\nme--"\r\n\r\n"One toe _today_, perhaps," said the doctor heavily. "But _tomorrow_--"\r\nHe heaved a sigh. "How about your breathing lately? Been growing short\r\nof breath when you hurry upstairs?"\r\n\r\n"Well--I _have_ been bothered a little."\r\n\r\n"I thought so! Heart pound when you run for the subway? Feel tired all\r\nday? Pains in your calves when you walk fast?"\r\n\r\n"Uh--yes, occasionally, I--" Wheatley looked worried and rubbed his toe\r\non the chair leg.\r\n\r\n"You know that fifty-five is a dangerous age," said the doctor gravely.\r\n"Do you have a cough? Heartburn after dinner?

Just as I thought! And no checkup for ten years!" He sighed\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"I suppose I should have seen to it," Wheatley admitted. "But you see,\r\nit\'s just that my toe--"\r\n\r\n"My dear fellow! Your toe is _part_ of you. It doesn\'t just exist down\r\nthere all by itself. If your _toe_ hurts, there must be a _reason_."\r\n\r\nWheatley looked more worried than ever. "There must? I thought--perhaps\r\nyou could just give me a little something--"\r\n\r\n"To stop the pain?" The doctor looked shocked. "Well, of course I could\r\n_do_ that, but that\'s not getting at the root of the trouble, is it?\r\nThat\'s just treating symptoms. Medieval quackery. Medicine has advanced\r\na long way since your last checkup, my friend. And even treatment has\r\nits dangers. Did you know that more people died last year of _aspirin_\r\npoisoning than of _cyanide_ poisoning?"\r\n\r\nWheatley wiped his forehead. "I--dear me! I never realized--"\r\n\r\n"We have to _think_ about those things," said the doctor. "Now, the\r\nproblem here is to find out _why_ you have the pain in your toe. It\r\ncould be inflammatory. Maybe a tumor. Perhaps it could be, uh,\r\nfunctional ... or maybe vascular!"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you could take my blood pressure, or something," Wheatley\r\noffered.\r\n\r\n"Well, of course I _could_. But that isn\'t really my field, you know. It\r\nwouldn\'t really _mean_ anything, if I did it. But there\'s nothing to\r\nworry about. We have a fine Hypertensive man at the Diagnostic Clinic."\r\nThe doctor checked the appointment book on his desk. "Now, if we could\r\nsee you there next Monday morning at nine--"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Very interesting X rays," said the young doctor with the red hair.\r\n"_Very_ interesting. See this shadow in the duodenal cap? See the\r\nprolonged emptying time? And I\'ve never seen such beautiful\r\npylorospasm!"\r\n\r\n"This is my toe?" asked Wheatley, edging toward the doctors. It seemed\r\nhe had been waiting for a very long time.\r\n\r\n"Toe! Oh, no," said the red-headed doctor. "No, that\'s the Orthopedic\r\nRadiologist\'s job. I\'m a Gastro-Intestinal man, myself. Upper. Dr.\r\nSchultz here is Lower." The red-headed doctor turned back to his\r\nconsultation with Dr. Schultz. Mr. Wheatley rubbed his toe and waited.\r\n\r\nPresently another doctor came by. He looked very grave as he sat down\r\nbeside Wheatley. "Tell me, Mr. Wheatley, have you had an orthodiagram\r\nrecently?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"An EKG?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Fluoroaortogram?"\r\n\r\n"I--don\'t _think_ so."\r\n\r\nThe doctor looked even graver, and walked away, muttering to himself. In\r\na few moments he came back with two more doctors. "--no question in _my_\r\nmind that it\'s cardiomegaly," he was saying, "but Haddonfield should\r\nknow. He\'s the best Left Ventricle man in the city. Excellent paper in\r\nthe AMA Journal last July: \'The Inadequacies of Modern Orthodiagramatic\r\nTechniques in Demonstrating Minimal Left Ventricular Hypertrophy.\' A\r\nbrilliant study, simply brilliant! Now _this_ patient--" He glanced\r\ntoward Wheatley, and his voice dropped to a mumble.\r\n\r\nPresently two of the men nodded, and one walked over to Wheatley,\r\ncautiously, as though afraid he might suddenly vanish. "Now, there\'s\r\nnothing to be worried about, Mr. Wheatley," he said. "We\'re going to\r\nhave you fixed up in just no time at all. Just a few more studies. Now,\r\nif you could see me in Valve Clinic tomorrow afternoon at three--"\r\n\r\nWheatley nodded. "Nothing serious, I hope?"\r\n\r\n"Serious? Oh, no! 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Dear me, you _mustn\'t_ worry. Everything is going to\r\nbe all right," the doctor said.\r\n\r\n"Well--I--that is, my toe is still bothering me some. It\'s not nearly as\r\nbad, but I wondered if maybe you--"\r\n\r\nDawn broke on the doctor\'s face. "Give you something for it? Well now,\r\nwe aren\'t Therapeutic men, you understand. Always best to let the expert\r\nhandle the problem in his own field." He paused, stroking his chin for a\r\nmoment. "Tell you what we\'ll do. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Dr. Epstein is one of the finest\r\nTherapeutic men in the city. He could take care of you in a jiffy. We\'ll\r\nsee if we can\'t arrange an appointment with him after you\'ve seen me\r\ntomorrow."\r\n\r\nMr. Wheatley was late to Mitral Valve Clinic the next day because he had\r\ngone to Aortic Valve Clinic by mistake, but finally he found the right\r\nwaiting room. A few hours later he was being thumped, photographed, and\r\nlistened to. Substances were popped into his right arm, and withdrawn\r\nfrom his left arm as he marveled at the brilliance of modern medical\r\ntechniques. Before they were finished he had been seen by both the\r\nMitral men and the Aortic men, as well as the Great Arteries man and the\r\nPeripheral Capillary Bed man.\r\n\r\nThe Therapeutic man happened to be in Atlantic City at a convention and\r\nthe Rheumatologist was on vacation, so Wheatley was sent to Functional\r\nClinic instead. "Always have to rule out these things," the doctors\r\nagreed. "Wouldn\'t do much good to give you medicine if your trouble\r\nisn\'t organic, now, would it?" The Psychoneuroticist studied his sex\r\nlife, while the Psychosociologist examined his social milieu. Then they\r\nconferred for a long time.\r\n\r\nThree days later he was waiting in the hallway downstairs again. Heads\r\nmet in a huddle; words and phrases slipped out from time to time as the\r\ndiscussion grew heated.\r\n\r\n"--no doubt in my mind that it\'s a--"\r\n\r\n"But we can\'t ignore the endocrine implications, doctor--"\r\n\r\n"You\'re perfectly right there, of course. Bittenbender at the University\r\nmight be able to answer the question. No better Pituitary\r\nOsmoreceptorologist in the city--"\r\n\r\n"--a Tubular Function man should look at those kidneys first. He\'s\r\nfifty-five, you know.

"\r\n\r\n"--has anyone studied his filtration fraction?"\r\n\r\n"--might be a peripheral vascular spasticity factor--"\r\n\r\nAfter a while James Wheatley rose from the bench and slipped out the\r\ndoor, limping slightly as he went.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe room was small and dusky, with heavy Turkish drapes obscuring the\r\ndark hallway beyond. A suggestion of incense hung in the air.\r\n\r\nIn due course a gaunt, swarthy man in mustache and turban appeared\r\nthrough the curtains and bowed solemnly. "You come with a problem?" he\r\nasked, in a slight accent.\r\n\r\n"As a matter of fact, yes," James Wheatley said hesitantly. "You see,\r\nI\'ve been having a pain in my right little toe...."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
