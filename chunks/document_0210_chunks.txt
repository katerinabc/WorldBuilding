]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a perfectly conventional tour, once around the Milky Way with\r\nstops at several of the major stars. It was supposed to take about\r\neighty-eight million years so they planned to be back for supper.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning the students had remained in a fairly close knot\r\naround mundo Karftahiti, their instructor, but as the tour progressed\r\nsome of the more venturesome strayed further and further from the rest\r\nof the class.\r\n\r\nDro Orena and Dro Xeluchli had wandered a greater distance than usual\r\nfrom the crowd and were jamming experimental thought webs into a large\r\nspace vortex when Xeluchli signalled to Orena to tune her mind off the\r\nlecture frequency. It was against the rules, of course, but then Orena\r\nsupposed Xeluchli would take the blame for her if they were caught, so\r\nshe switched over to the conversational band.\r\n\r\n"Want to have some fun?" asked Xeluchli.\r\n\r\nOrena continued to stare into the space vortex. "How?" she asked.\r\n\r\nXeluchli waved a visible thought fragment in a circle about him. "The\r\nstars," he said.

"Let\'s explore a little on our own.

They never hit the\r\nreally good spots on these tours."\r\n\r\nOrena had been thinking for a long time of doing that very thing so she\r\nhardly argued at all before letting Xeluchli convince her.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll be gone only a little while and they\'ll never miss us," said\r\nXeluchli as they headed for a nearby star-cluster.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEverything would have been all right if they had obeyed the rules.\r\n"Hands off the planets," the rules said, and that was really a\r\nreasonable and intelligent demand. In all fairness to them, it must be\r\nadmitted that Orena and Xeluchli had no intention of breaking that rule\r\nwhen they strayed away from the rest of the crowd.\r\n\r\nThey found this little planet which was listed in the textbook as\r\n"BuP"; an .02F star with nine planets. By a lucky chance they were just\r\nin time to see a transient little civilization spring into being on its\r\nthird planet. This was too wonderful a chance to miss so they decided\r\nto stay a few hundred thousand years and see how it would end. They\r\nwould catch up with the rest of the tour afterward.\r\n\r\nThe creatures entering into civilization were bipeds and of a physical\r\nappearance rather low on the aesthetic scale but Orena and Xeluchli\r\nsoon discovered that they were bi-sexual. This pleased them very much\r\nand made them feel that they had something in common with this little\r\ncivilization, for Orena and Xeluchli were bi-sexuals too, and bi-sexual\r\ncivilizations were rare. Orena and Xeluchli had, in fact, been the\r\nonly bi-sexuals in the touring group, which had been composed mostly\r\nof the slow-moving amoeboids from Procyon and the emotionally unstable\r\npenta-sexuals from Antares.\r\n\r\nIt was a land civilization which they had found and, just as the\r\ntextbooks said, it was having its beginning in the river deltas of\r\nthe continents. The bipeds were both herbivorous and carnivorous and\r\nthe duration and bloodiness of their early wars was almost exactly as\r\npredicted by Globnung\'s food-war formula. The speed of advance of the\r\ncivilization was a little slow, but still comfortably within the lower\r\nlimits of the Atati equation.\r\n\r\nEverything went well for the first five thousand years, but then Orena\r\nand Xeluchli began to catch signs of Gibrait\'s anachronism. They\r\nwatched anxiously for a while, and soon they saw that their fears\r\nhad been justified. Sociological advance had fallen so far behind\r\ntechnological advance that the Law of Socio-Martial Flux had been\r\nbrought into play. The little civilization would almost certainly die a\r\npremature death.\r\n\r\nOrena and Xeluchli watched the invention of greater and greater weapons\r\nand the hopeless retardation of the social system and were saddened.\r\nThey had hoped to watch a real civilization and this one was not even\r\ngoing to go past the one-planet stage. They did not see how it could\r\nlast half a century more.\r\n\r\n"And they\'re bi-sexuals, too," said Xeluchli. "It\'s a shame. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
I wish we\r\ncould do something."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but you know what the rules are," reminded Orena. "We can only\r\nwatch. We can\'t help them."\r\n\r\n"I know," said Xeluchli a little crossly. "A bunch of poly-sexuals and\r\nsixth-degree intellectuals make rules and we\'re supposed to obey them.\r\nYou know, I\'m tempted to interfere. No one would know."\r\n\r\nOrena objected, but she was really in favor of violating the rule, too,\r\nand after a while she let Xeluchli have his way.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll start the civilization over," he suggested. "It was low in some\r\nqualities at the very start, but if we begin it over again with two\r\nabove-average specimens I\'m sure it will turn out better this time."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll save one of each sex and destroy the rest of the race," agreed\r\nOrena. "It will be just like one of the controlled experiments in the\r\nlaboratories of Arcturus 7, but on an even larger scale. Oh, this will\r\nbe interesting!"\r\n\r\n"We\'ll go down to the planet ourselves," said Xeluchli, "and pick the\r\ntwo creatures we\'ll use. We\'ll guide them and their descendants for a\r\nwhile until we\'re sure they\'ll turn out all right."\r\n\r\nThey had been heading down toward the planet and now they landed on a\r\nmountaintop. "Shall we stay together?" asked Orena.\r\n\r\n"No, let\'s each of us observe the creatures separately at close range\r\nfor a while. Then, after we\'ve seen enough to make a good choice, we\'ll\r\npick two of them and destroy the rest."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll each pick one," suggested Orena. "You pick the female and I\'ll\r\npick the male."\r\n\r\nXeluchli agreed, and added, "When you\'ve found him, enclose him in a\r\nbubble of mental protection and turn your mind to wavelength OEC. I\'ll\r\nturn my mind to wavelength HHW when I have a female protected and the\r\ncombination of these waves, each harmless by itself, will result in\r\na .0008w wave which will destroy the rest of the race. Afterward we\'ll\r\nmeet on this hill."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was a city at the foot of the mountains and Orena headed there.\r\nShe intermingled her atoms with those of a building for a while and\r\nwatched from one of its inner walls, trying to get some idea of the\r\nhabits of the bipeds.\r\n\r\nAt first she was puzzled by the fact that only one sex of the creatures\r\nentered the room she was watching. After a while, though, she began to\r\nsuspect its true nature. She was learning little here, so she went out\r\ninto the streets of the city where she could observe all phases of life.\r\n\r\nAt first she assumed a shape that the bipeds could not see, but after\r\na while she decided that she could best accomplish her purpose in the\r\nguise of one of the bipeds themselves. She turned herself into a female\r\nof the species and began in earnest her search for a desirable male.\r\n\r\nShe found that the society was very primitive in most respects and\r\nthat it was not at all difficult to integrate herself into it. This\r\nwas a new experience for her and one of the most thrilling things that\r\nhad ever happened to her. One by one she dropped the use of senses\r\nand mental ranges not possessed by the bipeds to make the game more\r\nexciting. Soon her senses and thoughts were operating on a level hardly\r\nabove that of the creatures themselves.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShe often found herself wishing that she had paid more attention to\r\nher classes in the lower civilizations so she could better understand\r\nthe things she was seeing. She was in no hurry to bring this adventure\r\nto an end, so for several weeks she investigated male after male,\r\nlooking for one with a high socio-kinetic rating and a low or average\r\ntechno-kinetic rating.\r\n\r\nIt was about thirty days later that she made her decision. She had been\r\ntalking to a young male biped in a bookstore when she realized that he\r\nwould do at least as well as any she had come across so far. She found\r\nthat his name was Adam Henessey and she proceeded to sound him out a\r\nlittle further.\r\n\r\n"And literature, then," she asked, picking up a book from one of the\r\ntables, "wouldn\'t you say that great literature should be placed above\r\nscience?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," Adam agreed, "the _material_ is emphasized too strongly at\r\npresent. We must pay more attention to the _spiritual_." He adjusted\r\nhis eyelenses. "I believe that that is one of the major troubles of\r\ncivilization." He tapped the ashes from his cigarette and looked at her\r\nfor confirmation.\r\n\r\n"Hell, yes!" she agreed heartily. "We are concentrating on the means\r\nand forgetting the ends."\r\n\r\n"We are concentrating on the transient," he echoed, "and forgetting the\r\neternal."\r\n\r\nThis bit of conversation was enough to convince the somewhat satiated\r\nOrena. She cast a web of mental protection over the biped and set her\r\nmind to an OEI wavelength.\r\n\r\nObviously Xeluchli had already made his choice and set his mind to the\r\nHHW wavelength, for all the bipeds she could see except the protected\r\nAdam Henessey immediately fell to the ground and lay still. The effect\r\nwas odd and uncheerful.\r\n\r\nNow came one of the most interesting games she had played in her stay\r\non the planet. She tried to match the biped\'s state of bewilderment and\r\nterror with one of her own and at the same time lead him to the top of\r\nthe mountain. She could, of course, have transported him, protective\r\nweb and all, to the mountaintop in a split second, but that would have\r\nseemed like cheating at the game. The web protecting Adam Henessey was\r\ninvisible to his eyes and Orena continued to play the part of a fellow\r\nbiped.\r\n\r\nIn his confused state, it was not difficult to lead Adam up the\r\nmountain by little suggestions or, often by merely taking the first\r\nstep. She suggested that from the mountaintop they could see better\r\nwhat had happened and whether anyone else was alive.

He even added\r\nthe idea that they might get out of the area of contamination or\r\nwhatever it was by climbing. "Heavy gases stay low," he said, assuming,\r\napparently, that another war had been declared.\r\n\r\nThey were the first to reach the top, Xeluchli and his find were not\r\nyet in sight. Orena kept up her act while they waited. She and Adam\r\nHenessey searched out over the valleys below and chattered worried\r\nideas at each other.\r\n\r\nOrena was secretly watching for Xeluchli whenever she looked down the\r\nmountain but soon the sun set and the light faded. It was very dark\r\nin the valleys and she did not wish to use any but biped eyes in the\r\npresence of Adam Henessey, at least not until Xeluchli arrived, so she\r\ngave up looking.\r\n\r\nAs time went by she began to get worried. It was cold on the mountain\r\nand she grew impatient to change to some other form. She searched the\r\nvalleys below again, but not even a light of the dead city was visible.\r\n\r\nThe biped was growing nervous and she was not sure how much longer she\r\ncould keep him here. He was standing sheltered by a crag of rock and\r\ngazing out into the dark spaces where the city had been, and for a long\r\nwhile Orena stood near him and looked far out into the valleys to the\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nTime passed and finally the sun began to rise and she grew more worried\r\nthan ever. A terrible thought hit her and she shivered. She stole\r\nglances at Adam Henessey from time to time and she noticed that he was\r\nglancing queerly at _her_ now and then. This continued for some time.\r\n\r\nFinally she could stand it no longer.\r\n\r\nShe turned to him and asked:\r\n\r\n"Heavens, is that you, Xeluchli?"\r\n\r\nShe really did not need an answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
