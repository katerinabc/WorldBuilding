Something was haywire in the fuel system of his\r\nInterstar Runabout. He was losing altitude fast, so fast that all five\r\npairs of his eyes couldn\'t focus on a place to land.\r\n\r\nFive pairs of arms, each pair about three feet apart on the loglike\r\nbody, pushed buttons and rotated controls frantically, but to no avail.\r\nIn a few short minutes it would all be over for Probos Five. Even if by\r\nsome miracle he remained unhurt after crashing, he would die shortly\r\nthereafter. The frigid climatic conditions of the third planet were\r\ndeadly to a Mercurian. He thought once of donning his space suit but\r\ndecided against it. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
That would merely prolong the agony. From Planet\r\nThree, when one has a smashed space cruiser, there is no return. Probos\r\nFive knew that death was riding with him in the helpless ship. The\r\nsituation did not unnecessarily dismay him; Mercurians are philosophers.\r\n\r\nProbos Five ceased to manipulate the unresponding controls. Stretching\r\nhis trunklike torso to its full twenty feet, four heads gazed through\r\nobservation ports at the four points of the compass while the remaining\r\nhead desultorily watched the instrument panel.\r\n\r\nSince die he must, Probos Five would meet his end stoically, and five\r\npairs of stumpy arms folded over five chests in a coordinated gesture of\r\nresignation.\r\n\r\nProbos Five thought fleetingly of his wife Lingua Four and remembered\r\nwith some annoyance that she was the author of his present predicament.\r\nA social climber, Probos Five thought to himself, but aside from that a\r\ngood wife and mother in addition to being a reigning beauty. Lingua Four\r\nwas tall even for a Mercurian. Already she scaled seven dergs, or in\r\nEarth terms, fourteen feet and was beginning to show evidences of a\r\nfifth head. Five heads were rarely found on females and Probos Five was\r\njustly proud of his good fortune. In all Mercury at the present time, he\r\nknew of but two females possessing five heads and soon Lingua Four would\r\nbe the third of her sex to be thus endowed.\r\n\r\nYes, thought Probos Five, a woman to be proud of; for today after three\r\nvargs of marriage the memory of her trim trunk with four pairs of eyes\r\nlaughing mischievously, filled his five brains with flame. Slim as a\r\nbirch she stood in his memory, and eight eyes whispered lovers\' thoughts\r\nacross space and time.\r\n\r\nProbos Five recalled his five minds from their nostalgic reverie and\r\ngazed at the contour of the Earth that was rushing up to meet him.\r\nWhite, blazing white reflecting the rays of the midnight sun covered the\r\nregion as far as the eye could reach.\r\n\r\n"Good," thought Probos Five, "the Polar regions. That means the end will\r\ncome quickly. One or two seconds at the most of that bitter cold would\r\nbe enough."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTurning away from the windows Probos Five let his thoughts return to\r\nLingua Four, to Probos Two, his son, and his home on the first planet\r\nfrom the sun. Ah, that is the place to live, thought Probos, the\r\ntemperature an unchanging 327\xc2\xb0; just comfortably warm, where one could\r\nenjoy a life of warmth and ease. Too bad that he would not live to see\r\nit again. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Thirty vargs, he reflected, is such a short time. With luck,\r\nperhaps he may have lived to see a hundred vargs slip by. And perhaps in\r\ntime he may have added three more heads and five dergs in length to his\r\ntowering trunk.\r\n\r\nHe thought of Probos Two and wondered idly if his son would also visit\r\nthe barbarian worlds to collect data for Lingua Four.\r\n\r\nHe wished that he could have seen more of Probos Two. There\'s an\r\nup-and-coming lad, he thought, not quite two vargs old and two heads\r\nalready. Yes, indeed, he\'s quite a boy, Probos Five remembered proudly;\r\nmaybe his mother will keep him at home instead of running him all over\r\nthe universe to get material for her committees.\r\n\r\nHe wished that Lingua Four would settle down and be content as a\r\nhousewife, but he doubted that she would. Social ambition was boring\r\nlike a termite under her bark.\r\n\r\nLingua Four was determined to be the first lady of Arbor, the capital\r\ncity of Mercury. To this end Lingua Four had labored unceasingly. She\r\nwas president of half the women\'s clubs of Arbor. She could always be\r\ndepended upon to furnish the best in new and diverting subjects.\r\n\r\nShe headed almost all committees for aid or research on any type of\r\nproblem. It was owing to Lingua Four being president of the Committee\r\nfor Undernourished Arborians that Probos Five was making this\r\nill-starred trip. His purpose was to capture a few of the upright,\r\ndivided trunk animals that inhabited the third planet.\r\n\r\nThey were to be transported to Mercury and given over to scientific\r\nstudy as to their edible qualities. If it were found that the divided\r\ntrunk creatures were fit for Mercurian consumption, the problem of\r\nundernourishment would no longer exist since the supply of divided\r\ntrunks was seemingly inexhaustible. Mercurians had made expeditions to\r\nthe third planet before and every report concluded with--"Divided trunk\r\ncreatures increasing in number."\r\n\r\nPrivately Probos Five doubted the possibility of using the divided\r\ntrunks for food, since the last expedition once again reported a\r\ncomplete lack of captives due to the frail and tenuous bodies of the\r\ndivided trunks. Then, too, transportation and preservation posed a\r\ntremendous problem, not to mention the difficulty of trying to eat\r\nsomething that might vaporize on your fork. But then these questions may\r\nnever arise, he decided, for of all the reports perused by Probos Five\r\nnot one expedition had succeeded in bringing a divided trunk to Mercury.\r\n\r\nAll reports were read to the last letter by Probos Five before\r\nassembling equipment for his own trip. In the reports he had noted many\r\nof the difficulties of the earlier missions. Planet Three was impossible\r\nfor a Mercurian without a heated space suit. The temperature of Planet\r\nThree was so low that it would literally freeze a Mercurian stiff in a\r\nmatter of seconds.\r\n\r\nThe casualties of the early expeditions had been numerous. Many\r\nMercurians had succumbed to the bitter cold due to flaws in space suits\r\nand other accidents. A break in the suit meant instant death. The\r\nvictims of such mishaps were invariably buried in the isolated, sparsely\r\ninhabited Polar regions to avoid alarming the divided trunk creatures.\r\n\r\nIt was strange, mused Probos Five, that the divided trunks were\r\nseemingly unable to bear the slightest increase in temperature. Their\r\nbodies disintegrated upon contact with a Mercurian. Some were roped and\r\ndragged from a distance up to the doors of the space ships, but no\r\ninhabitant of Planet Three had been closer to Mercury than the air lock\r\nof the space cruisers. As the divided trunk people were dragged into the\r\nair lock, warm air from the ship would be pumped into the lock to dispel\r\nthe frigid air of Planet Three. As the warmth of Mercury enveloped the\r\ndivided trunks they became quite red, began to melt and finally\r\ndissolved into a gaseous state, leaving a small pile of ashes and a\r\ndisagreeable odor in the air lock that sometimes lingered for days.\r\n\r\nProbos Five believed he had the solution for these obstacles in the path\r\nof scientific study of the divided trunks. He had decided to use guile\r\nin place of strength. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
For this reason he had come alone and in a small\r\nspace runabout to put his solution to the test. But his solution now\r\ncould never be tried, he remembered morosely.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the aft compartment Probos Five had constructed a refrigeration\r\nplant. By maintaining a constant degree of frigidity he hoped to deliver\r\na pair of each species of divided trunks to Mercury. He hoped especially\r\nto capture a complete set and perhaps a few over to make up for breakage\r\nand losses. As to what form of sustenance the divided trunks were\r\naccustomed to, he had no idea whatsoever. He had intended to bring\r\nsamples of earth, vegetation and anything else that may have suggested a\r\nsource of food for the divided trunks.\r\n\r\nThe thought too had occurred to him that possibly the divided trunk\r\ncreatures ate one another. On the possibility of this Probos Five had\r\ndetermined to capture three black ones, three white ones, three yellows,\r\nthree browns and three reds, and three of any other color that he might\r\nfind. He rather doubted that more colors or combination of colors\r\nexisted. All previous expedition reports had mentioned only the five\r\ncolors. However, Probos Five had determined to keep several eyes open on\r\nthe off chance that he might find a new and different species.\r\n\r\nHis refrigerator was modeled along the architectural lines of the dens\r\nof the divided trunks. The main room of the refrigerator opened to the\r\noutside of the ship by means of a small air lock. A Mercurian size air\r\nlock was not needed for the divided trunks, as few had been found to be\r\nmuch over three dergs in height.\r\n\r\nWinches and cables to pull the divided trunks into the refrigerator were\r\ninstalled in the refrigerator room itself to avoid burning the divided\r\ntrunks with hot cables from other parts of the ship.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Probos Five had cunningly devised a refrigerated trap. This\r\ntoo was designed to simulate the caves of the divided trunk creatures\r\nbut was smaller. It was constructed with entrances readily seen and\r\nexits well hidden. Probos Five had expected great things of his trap. He\r\nhad conceived the idea after reading the report of a Mercurian\r\nexpedition that explored the dens of the divided trunks at some place\r\nmarked "Coney Island." According to the reports the divided trunks\r\nshowed no hesitancy in entering these types of dens. In fact, the writer\r\nof the report gave it as his opinion that the divided ones perhaps\r\nplayed games in these types of caves. It also mentioned that some of the\r\ndens were equipped with flat shiny surfaces that cast reflections or\r\nimages. Probos Five had incorporated the image-making surfaces into his\r\ntrap design. A pity that all this effort must be wasted, thought Probos\r\nas he once more turned to the observation ports to check his remaining\r\ndistance from the planet\'s surface. Seeing that his time was short,\r\nProbos Five turned all five faces forward in the Mercurian gesture of\r\ndisdain for death. A moment later came the shock.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA week later the proprietor of a novelty shop in Fairbanks watched two\r\nnatives with their dog team pulling something loglike through the snow\r\ntoward the trading post. Turning to a customer he remarked,\r\n\r\n"Here comes Ketch and Ah Koo dragging in another Totem Pole. Guess that\r\nKetch must be the biggest liar ever produced by the Eskimos. He tried to\r\ntell me that Totem Poles fall from the sky. Says he can always find one\r\nif he sees it fall because it\'s so hot it melts the snow around it.\r\nPersonally I think he should be elected president of the Liars\' Club,\r\nbut I\'ll buy the Totem Pole anyway. Those pesky tourists always whittle\r\na chunk out of my Totem Pole for a souvenir.\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad he\'s bringing me another one," the storekeeper concluded, "the\r\none he sold me last year is about whittled away."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Planet Stories_ January 1954.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.
