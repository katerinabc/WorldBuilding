"True, it is a small-scale experimental model. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
It\r\nwill operate only on objects weighing less than three pounds, five\r\nounces and for distances into the past and future of twelve minutes or\r\nless. But it works."\r\n\r\nThe small-scale model looked like a small scale--a postage scale--except\r\nfor two dials in the part under the platform.\r\n\r\nProfessor Johnson held up a small metal cube. "Our experimental object,"\r\nhe said, "is a brass cube weighing one pound, two point three ounces.\r\nFirst, I shall send it five minutes into the future."\r\n\r\nHe leaned forward and set one of the dials on the time machine. "Look at\r\nyour watches," he said.\r\n\r\nThey looked at their watches. Professor Johnson placed the cube gently\r\non the machine\'s platform. It vanished.\r\n\r\nFive minutes later, to the second, it reappeared.\r\n\r\nProfessor Johnson picked it up. "Now five minutes into the past." He set\r\nthe other dial. Holding the cube in his hand he looked at his watch. "It\r\nis six minutes before three o\'clock. I shall now activate the\r\nmechanism--by placing the cube on the platform--at exactly three\r\no\'clock. Therefore, the cube should, at five minutes before three,\r\nvanish from my hand and appear on the platform, five minutes before I\r\nplace it there."\r\n\r\n"How can you place it there, then?" asked one of his colleagues.\r\n\r\n"It will, as my hand approaches, vanish from the platform and appear in\r\nmy hand to be placed there. Three o\'clock. Notice, please."\r\n\r\nThe cube vanished from his hand.\r\n\r\nIt appeared on the platform of the time machine.\r\n\r\n"See? Five minutes before I shall place it there, it _is_ there!"\r\n\r\nHis other colleague frowned at the cube. "But," he said, "what if, now\r\nthat it has already appeared five minutes before you place it there, you\r\nshould change your mind about doing so and _not_ place it there at three\r\no\'clock? Wouldn\'t there be a paradox of some sort involved?"\r\n\r\n"An interesting idea," Professor Johnson said. "I had not thought of it,\r\nand it will be interesting to try. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Very well, I shall _not_ ..."\r\n\r\nThere was no paradox at all. The cube remained.\r\n\r\nBut the entire rest of the Universe, professors and all, vanished.\r\n\r\n\r\nSentry\r\n\r\nHe was wet and muddy and hungry and cold, and he was fifty thousand\r\nlight-years from home.\r\n\r\nA strange blue sun gave light and the gravity, twice what he was used\r\nto, made every movement difficult.\r\n\r\nBut in tens of thousands of years this part of war hadn\'t changed. The\r\nflyboys were fine with their sleek spaceships and their fancy weapons.\r\nWhen the chips are down, though, it was still the foot soldier, the\r\ninfantry, that had to take the ground and hold it, foot by bloody foot.\r\nLike this damned planet of a star he\'d never heard of until they\'d\r\nlanded him there. And now it was sacred ground because the aliens were\r\nthere too. _The_ aliens, the only other intelligent race in the\r\nGalaxy ... cruel, hideous and repulsive monsters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nContact had been made with them near the center of the Galaxy, after the\r\nslow, difficult colonization of a dozen thousand planets; and it had\r\nbeen war at sight; they\'d shot without even trying to negotiate, or to\r\nmake peace.\r\n\r\nNow, planet by bitter planet, it was being fought out.\r\n\r\nHe was wet and muddy and hungry and cold, and the day was raw with a\r\nhigh wind that hurt his eyes. But the aliens were trying to infiltrate\r\nand every sentry post was vital.\r\n\r\nHe stayed alert, gun ready. Fifty thousand light-years from home,\r\nfighting on a strange world and wondering if he\'d ever live to see home\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nAnd then he saw one of them crawling toward him. He drew a bead and\r\nfired. The alien made that strange horrible sound they all make, then\r\nlay still.\r\n\r\nHe shuddered at the sound and sight of the alien lying there. One ought\r\nto be able to get used to them after a while, but he\'d never been able\r\nto. Such repulsive creatures they were, with only two arms and two legs,\r\nghastly white skins and no scales.\r\n\r\n                                                       --FREDRIC BROWN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Galaxy Science Fiction_ February 1954.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.
