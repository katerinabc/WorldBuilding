But of course, that was\r\n              before Professor Madigan\'s invention, the--\r\n\r\n                               MAN-TRAP\r\n\r\n                             By Hal Annas\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Imagination Stories of Science and Fantasy\r\n                             December 1953\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nJerry Kerran watched the news analyst fade from the screen to be\r\nreplaced by a woman who looked directly at him and said, "Listen,\r\ngirls! Professor Madigan\'s greatest invention. A new kind of magnetism\r\nmore powerful than gravity. Works as a supplement to a natural\r\nmagnetism. Can be controlled--"\r\n\r\nKerran switched off the current. "Women," he growled. "Bah!"\r\n\r\nHe had three rules concerning woman: a) if she won\'t stay home and neck\r\non the sofa get rid of her; b) if she will stay home and neck on the\r\nsofa suspect her of matrimonial intentions and get rid of her; c) don\'t\r\nmonkey with her to begin with and avoid the nuisance of bothering with\r\nthe first two rules.\r\n\r\nHe rose to his lanky six feet of height, brushed the unruly red hair\r\nout of his eyes, strode to the door and turned the knob. The door\r\nswung wide. He glanced about briefly, then looked down and saw the girl.\r\n\r\nShe had, he realized, removed her highheels. Ordinarily the top of her\r\nplatinum hair came an inch above his shoulders. Not that he was in the\r\nhabit of getting close enough to determine this factor accurately, but\r\nhe couldn\'t help seeing her enter and leave the apartment across the\r\nway from time to time.\r\n\r\n"You knocked?" he said bruskly.\r\n\r\nHer head was tilted back, her blue eyes wide. "I need a pound of\r\nsugar," she said. "My pneumatic is out of order. Can\'t get deliveries."\r\n\r\n"You mean, you cook?" He stared in awe.\r\n\r\n"I\'m making a cake," she breathed, inching closer.\r\n\r\nHe backed out of the doorway and she entered. Without giving him\r\nanother glance, she went to the pneumatic, cut in the phone and ordered\r\na pound of sugar. She turned back to him.\r\n\r\n"It shouldn\'t be a minute. I\'ll wait--if you don\'t mind."\r\n\r\nHe had tried to keep himself from studying her. Despite this, his\r\neyes told him that her figure was just about perfect and as both a\r\ncounteraction and a stimulant to the mounting tension in him, her smile\r\nwas surprisingly bright and full. There was little danger of the flavor\r\nof her warpaint confusing a man. She wore little, if any. Her bright\r\nlips and cheeks seemed to need no added color.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t bother to stand," she said considerately. She waited until he\r\nhad lowered himself to the couch, then dropped down beside him, a\r\ntrifle too close to allow him to put his mind on other things.\r\n\r\n"I hope I haven\'t troubled you." Her hand brushed his.\r\n\r\n"Not at all." He drew his hand away.\r\n\r\n"From the looks of your side-board," she went on cheerily, "you were\r\njust getting ready to mix a drink. I\'m an expert. Shall I mix a couple?"\r\n\r\nHe resisted the inclination to rise when she did, and deliberately kept\r\nhis eyes from following her. He snatched up the paper, rustled it\r\nnoisily and tried to concentrate on the headlines.\r\n\r\nTwo things distracted him. One was the faint scent of perfume and the\r\nother was the chinking of ice and glasses. He put the paper aside,\r\ntried to put his mind on distant things. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
This soon palled. He was about\r\nto get up and pace the floor when she returned and handed him a cool\r\nglass.\r\n\r\n"Thanks," he said and leaned back.\r\n\r\nShe sat down again, so close that her shoulder brushed his. He\r\nedged over against the arm of the couch, putting an inch of space\r\nbetween them, glanced sidelong at her, and drank. He rolled his eyes\r\nceiling-ward, smacked his lips and drank again.\r\n\r\n"What did you put in it?"\r\n\r\n"About a spoonful of creme de menthe, a couple drops of bitters and\r\nabout two ounces of rye. Like it?"\r\n\r\nHe scowled deliberately, armoring himself against his feelings. "It\'s\r\nfair--for a woman\'s mixings. You should have put in more liquor."\r\n\r\n"Of course. I\'ll learn."\r\n\r\n"Not from me," he snapped. "I\'m a woman-hater."\r\n\r\nShe leaned toward him. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
"Why?"\r\n\r\nHe tossed off the balance of the drink, set the glass on the table and\r\nmade a sweeping gesture. "They\'re all alike," he said brutally. "Fickle\r\nand treacherous. Deceivers. Always flinging their sex around."\r\n\r\n"Not all women," she countered. "Take this Professor Madigan who\r\ndiscovered that new adhesion force."\r\n\r\n"A woman?"\r\n\r\n"Of course. Professor Madigan is a scholarly young woman. Her sex\r\nappeal might not win a beauty contest, but she discovered a perfectly\r\nwonderful man-catcher."\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"A new force. Works like gravity--only it\'s different. Its strength\r\nincreases in ratio to the square of the distance."\r\n\r\n"What are you talking about? Women don\'t understand things like that."\r\n\r\n"No?"\r\n\r\n"No! Need I spell it out for you? Your delivery should be in the\r\npneumatic by now. Why don\'t you pick it up and go home and make your\r\ncake?"\r\n\r\n"I shall. I had no idea I was living next door to a misogynist, and a\r\nbrutal one at that."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like women," Kerran said emphatically. "They\'re all alike.\r\nFickle. Deceivers. Everything about them artificial. Lips, color,\r\nshape."\r\n\r\nThe girl rose and stood over him. "I\'m not wearing make-up," she\r\nasserted. "You flatter yourself in thinking I would put on my face to\r\ncome across the hall."\r\n\r\n"Your shape! Your hips aren\'t that neat!"\r\n\r\nThe color rose in her cheeks. She lifted a hand as though to strike\r\nhim. The hand trembled. She lowered it to her side. "I do not wear a\r\ngirdle. Want to feel?"\r\n\r\n"No," he said, his own color rising. "Go on home."\r\n\r\nIgnoring the pneumatic, she crossed to the door, snatched it open,\r\nmarched into the corridor. Through the open doorway he heard the knob\r\nturn on her door. He went to the pneumatic, picked up the sugar, strode\r\nacross the corridor and knocked. In a moment her head appeared, then\r\nthe door swung wide.\r\n\r\n"You forgot something," he said contritely. "Sorry I was rude. I\'m\r\na natural woman-hater, and a moment before you came in some wench\r\non television triggered my feelings on the subject.... Just keep on\r\nyour own side of the fence and I\'ll stay on mine. I\'ll even speak\r\nto you occasionally, if you wish, but that\'s as far as I\'ll go in\r\nneighborliness."\r\n\r\n"Thanks," she said. "You\'re more than kind. But I shan\'t trouble you.\r\nI\'ve just become a man-hater."\r\n\r\nKerran turned to go. Halfway across the corridor he felt something tug\r\nat him. It was a steady and increasingly powerful pull, forcing him\r\ninto the girl\'s apartment. He lost his balance, reeled through the\r\ndoorway, came to a halt against the table, noticed that the force still\r\ndrew him toward the girl on the far side of the table.\r\n\r\n"Well?" she said.\r\n\r\n"Er-uh, just dropped in. Going right back out."\r\n\r\nHe got halfway to the door before it again took effect. He leaned\r\nagainst it, dug his feet into the carpet, pushed. He almost reached the\r\ndoor. He could go no farther, knew he was going to be snatched back to\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\nHe turned, dug in his heels, braced himself, and then the girl came\r\nflying over the table and directly into his arms. Instantly the force\r\nreleased him and he fell with the girl on top.\r\n\r\nThe platinum hair was in his eyes, against his face, the scent of\r\nperfume all about, the full weight of the soft warm flesh pressing him\r\ndown. Then she struggled up, stood erect.\r\n\r\nGetting his feet under him, he said, "I want to apologize. Your shape\r\nis natural. You don\'t wear a girdle. And now I\'ll be going.

=== Chunk 4 ===
"\r\n\r\nHe had scarcely turned before he felt it again. He swung back quickly,\r\nsaw that the girl was hanging on the sofa. He lost his balance, went\r\nstaggering toward her, flung out his arms, and the next thing he knew\r\nshe was pressing against him, standing on her toes, and her lips were\r\nbrushing his cheek, and they were moist and warm and soft.\r\n\r\nShe drew back and said, belligerently, "I wish you\'d get out of here."\r\n\r\nHe started again, hesitated when he felt the force, turned back. "I\'ve\r\nheard of magnetic women," he said with restraint. "I never believed in\r\nit. But now--" He gestured vaguely. "Please turn off your charms."\r\n\r\nShe lowered her eyes. "I thought it was you. I\'ve been drawn to you\r\nfrom the first and I thought you\'d suddenly become irresistible. Do you\r\nmean you feel it too?"\r\n\r\nHe nodded. "I\'ve read about magnetic women in the best books. Now, dash\r\nit, turn it off! I\'m getting tired of hanging around here."\r\n\r\n"It\'s you," she insisted. "You turn it off."\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. "I\'m plain as an old shoe. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Everybody knows. But you!\r\nOne look at you and anybody\'d know you\'ve got this magnetism. That\'s\r\nwhy I had to be so brutal. It was the only way I could resist and keep\r\nmy woman-hating integrity. I can feel your magnetism now. It\'s getting\r\nstronger."\r\n\r\n"And I feel yours. It\'s pulling me right into your arms."\r\n\r\n"Stay back. I can\'t stand much more. I\'m a confirmed misogynist, and if\r\nyou keep on I\'ll have to go against my principles, and that wouldn\'t be\r\nhonest."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t help it," she murmured from two feet away. "I can\'t resist\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nKerran puzzled briefly. "Maybe that\'s it. I remember when I was\r\noverseas. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
But no! All they wanted was chewing gum and cigarets. Still,\r\nyou never can tell. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Maybe it came on me suddenly. Maybe looking at you\r\nsort of triggered my magnetism."\r\n\r\nShe smiled. "If you\'ll quit looking at me maybe we can stop it. Look\r\nthe other way and I\'ll try to stop thinking about you because you do\r\nsomething to me."\r\n\r\nKerran nodded. "That\'s it. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
Beat it! 

=== Chunk 9 ===
I\'ll put my mind on something else."\r\n\r\nVisualizing a horse race in which he had his money on the bang-tail\r\njust ready to break the tape, he didn\'t feel the tug for several\r\nseconds. He struggled mightily but futilely to resist. He wound up in\r\nthe kitchen where the girl was holding onto the electric range.\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t play fair," he said accusingly. "Treacherous. Just like\r\nall your sex. You thought about me."\r\n\r\nShe lowered her eyes. "I--I just couldn\'t help it."\r\n\r\nKerran felt his chest expand involuntarily. "One of us is\r\nirresistible," he said. "It isn\'t you because I positively was not\r\nthinking about you. So it must be me." His chest expanded another inch.\r\n"I guess a girl who can\'t resist me would be true. And since we can\'t\r\nbeat this force, the only solution is to get married."\r\n\r\nShe nodded. "That\'s the only solution. But maybe I don\'t want to solve\r\nthe problem. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
You\'ll have to persuade me."\r\n\r\nThe voice from the television in the living room was barely audible in\r\nthe kitchen: "The new force was originally developed for the purpose\r\nof drawing troops into a compact group so they could be atom-bombed.\r\nProfessor Madigan refused to disclose its secret to be used for that\r\npurpose. She pointed out that it had a far more useful potential. A\r\nfield of it, built into a woman\'s garments, enables her to attract at\r\na distance the man of her choice. She can control this with a switch\r\nconveniently located in a pocket. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
Her own charms do the rest."\r\n\r\nKerran ignored the telecast. She was in his arms and he had his face\r\nhalf-buried in her silken hair. "I don\'t even know your name ..." he\r\nlaughed embarrassedly.\r\n\r\nHer voice was low and soft as she murmured, "Madigan--Joyce Madigan."\r\n\r\nHe stiffened suddenly. "You mean you\'re _Professor_ Madigan--"\r\n\r\nShe snuggled closer against him and somehow it didn\'t really seem to\r\nmatter now what her name was. "Let\'s say I _was_ Professor Madigan--a\r\nwoman\'s place is in the home, don\'t you agree?"\r\n\r\nAfter a few emphatic kisses he did.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
