So Filmore decided he\r\n            might pick up a pointer or two before the big--\r\n\r\n                        Slaughter On Dornel IV\r\n\r\n                           By Ivar Jorgensen\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Imagination Stories of Science and Fantasy\r\n                              April 1957\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLarry Filmore stared at his beer and mentally roasted his fight manager\r\nfor the fiftieth time. Human beings were supposed to be the toughest\r\nrace that the Galaxy had ever spawned, but as a fighter, Larry didn\'t\r\nput too much faith in the theory. He had fought a good many races\r\nthroughout the Galaxy, and, although he had always come out the winner,\r\nhe had plenty of scars to show for it.\r\n\r\nHe looked around the bar. It was full of various beings, none of them\r\nhuman except himself.\r\n\r\n_What am I doing here?_ he asked himself. _I\'m sitting in a cheap\r\nlittle bar on Dornel IV, waiting for a Dornellian fighter to kill me\r\ntomorrow._\r\n\r\nBut there was no way out of it, Filmore thought bitterly. Blackmer,\r\nhis manager, had the whole thing sewed up. Larry had found out, three\r\nmonths before, that Blackmer was cheating him--but that had been too\r\nlate. According to the contract, Larry had to finish the season or go\r\nto prison. If he quit, he would, according to the law, be cheating his\r\nmanager.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if he got killed during the battle, his entire check\r\nwould go to Blackmer.\r\n\r\nSo Blackmer had done the smart thing--for him. He had lined up Larry\r\nwith Fornax Kedrin, the champion of Dornel.\r\n\r\nThe Dornellians were big--eight feet high, with fingers that ended\r\nin razor-sharp claws. Of course, Larry would be provided with steel\r\nextensions on his fingers, but they wouldn\'t help much; Larry had never\r\nlearned to use them. Fornax Kedrin would kill him in the first round.\r\n\r\nLarry took another sip of his beer and stared forlornly at the bar.\r\nWith his fingers, he traced meaningless designs in the moisture left by\r\nthe cold glass.\r\n\r\nMaybe he was taking the coward\'s way out--but it was the only way he\r\ncould see. Better a live coward, he thought, than a dead hero.\r\n\r\n"Another beer, bartender," he called, finishing the one he held.\r\n\r\n"Coming up, Earthman."\r\n\r\nThe beer arrived and he took a sip. Training? 

=== Chunk 2 ===
The hell with it, he\r\nthought happily. He was going to get himself completely stewed tonight.\r\nLive high, die young, and have a good-looking corpse.\r\n\r\nOr maybe it would be better simply to get aboard a spaceship and try to\r\nget away. Maybe the Interstellar Police would never find him.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head dismally. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
That wouldn\'t work, either. Nothing would\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nIf only he\'d had some practice fighting a Dornellian!\r\n\r\nHe reached out for his beer, not noticing that someone had taken the\r\nvacant seat next to him. His elbow collided with a glass. The glass\r\ntipped, pouring a green, bubbling liquor all over the Dornellian\r\nsitting next to him.\r\n\r\n"Stupid Earthman!" snapped the Dornellian contemptuously. "A clumsy\r\nbeast like you shouldn\'t be allowed to enter a public place!"\r\n\r\nWith one hairy paw, the Dornellian shoved against Larry\'s shoulder,\r\nintending to push him off the bar stool.\r\n\r\nLarry moved back, more in astonishment than anything else. He hadn\'t\r\nknown that Dornellians had any particular prejudice against Earthmen,\r\nbut there was unmistakable racial hatred in the alien\'s voice. He put\r\nout his hand to the bar and stopped himself from falling off the stool.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the idea of that?" Larry growled. "That was an accident, and--"\r\n\r\n"Are you trying to argue with me? Here is the rest of the drink!" The\r\nDornellian laughed and heaved the remaining contents of the glass in\r\nLarry\'s face.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA blinding tide of red fury washed over Larry. Without thinking,\r\nreacting purely by instinct, he lashed out at the Dornellian.\r\n\r\nHis fist didn\'t contact; it was blocked by the heavy forearm of his\r\nopponent. A hand raked out at Larry, a hand with six fingers, each of\r\nwhich was tipped with long, cutting talons. Larry moved his head aside\r\nbarely in time. The talons raked across his cheek, drawing blood. If he\r\nhadn\'t ducked, the cut would have ripped his throat open.\r\n\r\nThe Dornellian\'s other hand slashed out. Larry blocked it with his own\r\narm and sent a hard left to the midsection of the eight-foot monster.\r\n\r\nThe Dornellian backed away, snarling. The fight was on for real, now.\r\n"Little Earthman, I\'m going to kill you!"\r\n\r\nHe leaped in suddenly, and his fist smashed against Larry\'s face. Larry\r\nrolled with the blow, but it brought the taste of blood to his mouth.\r\n\r\nHis feet moving fast, the Earthman bobbed back away from the giant.\r\nHe felt a glow of pleasure within himself. Here was his chance to\r\npractice a little with a Dornellian! What better training was there for\r\na championship bout than a barroom brawl? He had to watch out for those\r\nclaws though--those deadly razors that sprouted from the Dornellian\'s\r\nfingertips.\r\n\r\nTwo other Dornellians started to move in, but an Aldebaranian--a huge\r\nreptilian beast, slow-moving but powerful--stepped in front of them.\r\n\r\n"Keep back," he hissed, in his snakelike voice. "This is a personal\r\nquarrel."\r\n\r\nLarry heard an Arcturian spider-man click his mandibles together and\r\nwhisper: "Yes, let the Earthman fight it out by himself."\r\n\r\nLarry wasn\'t too worried. He had fought to the death on half a hundred\r\nplanets, and hadn\'t been killed yet. An ordinary Dornellian didn\'t\r\nbother him much. He moved in confidently for the knockout.\r\n\r\nHis fist lashed out, but his opponent was even faster. Larry connected\r\nwith nothing but empty air, and the Dornellian\'s claws raked down his\r\nside as the other hand slammed against the side of his head.\r\n\r\nDazed, Larry danced back. His arm was dripping blood, and his head felt\r\ngroggy and heavy.\r\n\r\nThe Dornellian threw a left jab, and Larry blocked it with his own left\r\narm. But the giant had done something unexpected. Instead of striking\r\nwith his closed fist, he had suddenly extended his fingers. The sharp\r\nclaws stabbed deep into the muscle of the Earthman\'s forearm, sending a\r\nwave of pain to his shoulder.\r\n\r\nAgain Larry backed away, his arm aching from the wounds. Quickly, he\r\nreversed his direction and stepped back in. This time, he used a kick\r\nbut the Dornellian sidestepped. The toe of Larry\'s boot caught his hip.\r\nCursing, the Dornellian closed in.\r\n\r\nHe punched a hand forward, claws extended. Larry stepped to one side\r\nand grabbed the hairy wrist. Using the giant\'s strength and weight\r\nto his own advantage, he propelled the monster across the room,\r\nslamming him up against the bar. Then he leaped forward to smash in the\r\nDornellian\'s ribcage with his heavy boots.\r\n\r\nHe was not quick enough. The giant rolled aside and sprang to his feet.\r\nSnarling viciously, he advanced toward the Earthman.\r\n\r\nOne hand came down in a hard, chopping blow. Larry managed to fend\r\nit off, but the Dornellian\'s other hand slugged into the pit of his\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\nWeak with pain, Larry staggered back. He aimed a kick at the alien\'s\r\nshin, and it connected hard. Taking advantage of his opportunity, Larry\r\nstepped in. His heel came down on the Dornellian\'s toes at the same\r\ntime that his fist slammed into the bristly jaw.\r\n\r\nThe giant reeled backwards, his taloned hand slashing through the air.\r\nHe regained his balance and came forward again, but this time Larry was\r\nready for him.\r\n\r\nThe Dornellian stepped square into a blow to the stomach.\r\n\r\nOddly enough, it didn\'t seem to bother him much. Then Larry remembered\r\nthat the Dornellian nervous system wasn\'t much like an Earthman\'s; the\r\nnerves just weren\'t in the same places.\r\n\r\nBut where were they? Again he cursed Blackmer. The manager hadn\'t told\r\nhim anything about Dornellians, had let him sign for the fight with\r\nFornax Kedrin even though it would be sheer murder.\r\n\r\n_Well_, Larry thought somberly, _I\'ll learn tonight. If I ever get out\r\nof this bar alive._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe took a deep breath and glanced at the giant, who had recovered from\r\nLarry\'s onslaught. The Dornellian stepped in with a fast one-two--a\r\nrake across the face with his left and a smash to the heart with his\r\nright.\r\n\r\nThe claws to his face alerted Larry for the blow to the heart;\r\nhe stepped back just enough to avoid being really hurt. But the\r\nDornellian\'s talons had raked his forehead, cutting in deeply. Blood\r\nwas pouring down over his eyes.\r\n\r\nHe took a quick look around the bar. The customers were gathered in\r\na ring and were watching the contest wide-eyed, as if they were in\r\nfifty-credit ringside seats.\r\n\r\nThe Dornellian still looked relatively unscratched, while Larry knew he\r\nlooked as though he\'d rolled over a barbed-wire fence. But in spite of\r\nthe blood, Larry had finally gotten the measure of his opponent. The\r\neight-foot giant weighed close to five hundred pounds; his mass was too\r\ngreat for him to be able to handle his body rapidly, no matter how\r\nfast his reflexes were.\r\n\r\nLarry moved in again. He planted a hard right directly in the giant\'s\r\nthroat--there _had_ to be nerves there. The Dornellian gagged and\r\ndropped his head. Larry smiled and slammed his fist into the giant\'s\r\nrib cage, doubling him up even more. He could almost hear the crowd\r\ncheering now as he moved in for the kill.\r\n\r\nHe sucked in his breath and lifted one foot from the floor. His right\r\nfist came up from his knees, gaining speed as it rose. Like a hammer,\r\nit crashed into the hairy jaw of the Dornellian, and Larry could feel\r\nbone splintering against his knuckles.\r\n\r\nLike an oak with rotten roots, the great Dornellian toppled to the\r\nfloor. He landed with a crash that seemed to shake the building.\r\n\r\nLarry stood over the fallen giant for a moment, catching his breath,\r\nwondering when the referee was going to start the count. Then he\r\nrealized there wasn\'t going to be any count. There wasn\'t any referee.\r\n\r\nHis arms were quivering, and his face was dripping with blood. He\r\nturned away, mopping his face clean, and started to pick up his\r\nunfinished beer when the wailing of sirens echoed through the bar.\r\n\r\nPolice! Someone had called the Dornellian police!\r\n\r\nThe Arcturian spider-man sidled up to him. "Well done, Earthman," he\r\nsaid in his whispering voice. "Come with me; I have a car outside."\r\nWithout another word, the Arcturian scuttled toward the door.\r\n\r\nLarry paused for a fraction of a second before making up his mind. As\r\nwell trust the Arcturian as anyone; if the police caught him, his life\r\nwouldn\'t be worth a counterfeit credit.\r\n\r\nNo one tried to stop him as he ran out the door.\r\n\r\nThe Arcturian\'s car was waiting just outside. Larry climbed in, and the\r\nspider-man slammed one of his many feet down on the accelerator. The\r\ncar shot off into the night, its turboelectric engine humming smoothly.\r\n\r\n"Well, Earthman," said the grating, whispering voice, "You made hash\r\nout of the Dornellian. Frankly, I was surprised.

=== Chunk 4 ===
"\r\n\r\n"So was I," Larry said. "I don\'t know why I\'m bothering to run away.\r\nAll they\'ll have to do is pick me up at my hotel."\r\n\r\nThe Arcturian chuckled dryly. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
"No. I don\'t think anyone recognized you.\r\nDon\'t forget that all Earthmen look alike to other beings. The only\r\nreason I knew who you were is that I\'m a fan of yours. I was glad to\r\nsee you beat that Dornellian, believe me."\r\n\r\n"Thanks," Larry said. "But it\'s not going to do me any good when I get\r\ninto the ring against Fornax Kedrin. If an ordinary Dornellian citizen\r\nputs up a fight like that, what am I going to do against a professional\r\nboxer?"\r\n\r\nThe Arcturian laughed again. "Just get in there and fight, Filmore. You\r\ncan handle him. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
I\'m sure you can."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe car pulled up before the hotel where Larry and his manager were\r\nstaying, and Larry got out. The Arcturian waved to him and drove off.\r\n\r\nWearily, Larry dragged himself inside and into the elevator.\r\n\r\n"Seventeen, please."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, Mr. Filmore," said the Dornellian elevator boy.\r\n\r\nHe pushed open the door to his room and dropped on the bed, dead tired.\r\nHe didn\'t dare look in the mirror; he was afraid to see what a mess the\r\nDornellian had made out of his face, which hadn\'t been any too neat\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n"Blackmer?" he called.\r\n\r\nThere was no answer. The manager was not around. Larry got up, looked\r\nbleary-eyed into the other room, and, seeing no one, dropped off into\r\na deep sleep. His last thought before he blacked out was that he\'d get\r\ninto the ring and do his best. He\'d already beaten _one_ Dornellian;\r\nhow tough could Fornax Kedrin be? And what did it matter anyway? 

=== Chunk 7 ===
He\r\nwas bound to get killed sooner or later anyway. That was the unspoken\r\nassumption every fighter operated under.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke the following morning, he didn\'t feel quite so certain\r\nabout things. The brawl the night before had taken a terrific toll on\r\nhis nervous system, and he knew that he\'d be butchered if he stepped\r\ninto the ring with the Dornellian champ. He was in no condition to\r\nfight.\r\n\r\n"Blackmer? 

=== Chunk 8 ===
You here?"\r\n\r\nThe manager\'s bed had been slept in, but there was no sign of him.\r\nLarry groped for the house phone, grabbed it, spoke into it. "Do you\r\nknow where Mr. Blackmer is?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s in the bar, sir," said the switchboard boy. "Do you want me to\r\ncall him for you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, please."\r\n\r\nA moment later, Larry heard the manager\'s harsh voice. "Blackmer here.\r\nWho\'s calling?"\r\n\r\n"This is Larry. I\'m ready for that fight, Blackmer," he said, hoping\r\nhe\'d have the strength to go through with it. "And after I get through\r\nwith the Dornellian, I\'m going to knock your teeth in. This is my last\r\nfight for you."\r\n\r\n"Now Larry," Blackmer said. "Don\'t be hasty. I--"\r\n\r\n"Shut up! We\'re quits! I may get killed in that ring, but I\'ll fight\r\njust this once and--"\r\n\r\n"What? Haven\'t you heard? 

=== Chunk 9 ===
The fight\'s off!"\r\n\r\nLarry blinked in astonishment. "How would I have heard?"\r\n\r\n"I thought the news was all over. That\'s why I didn\'t bother to wake\r\nyou. Fornax Kedrin is in the hospital. He got his jaw broken in a bar\r\nbrawl last night. Nobody knows who did it. But I got another bout lined\r\nup on Domerang VI with--"\r\n\r\n"Skip it," Larry said. "I\'ll discuss it with you some other time."\r\n\r\nLarry slowly dropped the receiver back on the hook. He grinned. And\r\nthen he began to laugh.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
