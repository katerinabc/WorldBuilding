"No use trying to gloss it over,"\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\nThe young men nodded. If this shot failed it might be a hundred years\r\nbefore Congress could be conned into another appropriation. The three\r\nyoung men had an even better reason not to fail. They were going to be\r\nin the rocket.\r\n\r\nHagstrom spoke. "There were no technical difficulties in the previous\r\nshots."\r\n\r\n"Right," the general said. "Take-offs proceeded according to schedule.\r\nOrbital corrections were made; then everybody settled down for a\r\nfour-month wait. When deceleration time came the shot was still in the\r\ngroove."\r\n\r\n"We know," van den Burg said tiredly. He worked a microscopic speck of\r\ndirt from under a fingernail. There was a loud snap as he snipped the\r\nnail off. He stared at the general, a lean forefinger to one side of\r\nhis ascetic nose.\r\n\r\n"I\'m no expert," the general said wearily. "When you reach my age they\r\nturn you into an office boy."\r\n\r\nHagstrom lit a cigarette. "It\'s tomorrow, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\nThe general nodded. "They\'re loading now."\r\n\r\nThe third man\'s slight build and bushy black hair belied his mestizo\r\norigins. "I still don\'t think much of those rations," he said.\r\n\r\nHagstrom laughed suddenly. "You aren\'t going to con me into eating\r\npickled fire bombs for four months."\r\n\r\n"If I lived on prune soup and codfish balls I\'d make no cracks about\r\nMexican food," Ar\xc3\xa9chaga grunted. "You squareheads don\'t appreciate good\r\ncooking."\r\n\r\n"You won\'t get any good cooking in zero gravity," the general said.\r\nThey got up and filed out the door, putting on their caps and military\r\nmanners.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOutside, trucks clustered at the base of a giant gantry. Ar\xc3\xa9chaga\r\nshuddered as a fork lift dropped a pallet of bagged meat on the gantry\r\nplatform. The meat was irradiated and sealed in transparent plastic,\r\nbut the habits of a lifetime in the tropics do not disappear in spite\r\nof engineering degrees. All that meat and not a fly in sight, he\r\nthought. It doesn\'t look right.\r\n\r\nMultiple-stage rockets had gone the way of square sail and piston\r\nengines when a crash program poured twenty-two mega-bucks into a\r\nnon-mechanical shield. Piles now diverted four per cent of their output\r\ninto a field which reflected neutrons back onto the pile instead of\r\nabsorbing them. Raise the reaction rate and the field tightened. Those\r\nsudden statewide evacuations in the early years of the century were\r\nnow remembered only by TV writers.\r\n\r\nA liquid metal heat exchanger transferred energy to the reaction mass\r\nwhich a turbine pump was drawing from a fire hydrant. Since the hydrant\r\nwas fed from a sea water still there was no need for purification.\r\n\r\nThe last load of provisions went up and an asepsis party rode the\r\ngantry, burdened with their giant vacuum cleaners and germicidal\r\napparatus.\r\n\r\n"They\'ll seal everything but the control room," the general said. "When\r\nyou go aboard there\'ll only be one compartment to sterilize."\r\n\r\n"I still think it\'s a lot of hog-wash," Ar\xc3\xa9chaga said.\r\n\r\n"They can\'t have us carrying any bugs with us," van den Burg said\r\ntiredly.\r\n\r\n"The Martians might put us in quarantine," Hagstrom added sourly.\r\n\r\n"If there are any Martians--and if we get there," Ar\xc3\xa9chaga groused.\r\n\r\n"Now boys," the general began.\r\n\r\n"Oh, save it, Pop," Hagstrom said. "Let\'s be ourselves as long as the\r\npublic relations pests aren\'t around."\r\n\r\n"Anybody going to town?" van den Burg asked.\r\n\r\n"I am," Ar\xc3\xa9chaga said. "May be quite a while before I get another\r\nplate of fried beans."\r\n\r\n"Checkup at 0400," the general reminded.\r\n\r\nHagstrom went to B.O.Q. Van den Burg and Ar\xc3\xa9chaga caught the bus into\r\ntown and lost each other until midnight when they caught the same bus\r\nback to the base.\r\n\r\n"What\'s in the sack?" Hagstrom asked.\r\n\r\n"Snack," Ar\xc3\xa9chaga said. "I can\'t stand that insipid slop in the B.O.Q.\r\nmess."\r\n\r\n"Looks like a lot of snack to eat between now and daybreak."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t worry, I\'ve got quite an appetite."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt 0345 an orderly knocked on three doors in Bachelor Officers\'\r\nQuarters and three young men made remarks which history will delete.\r\nThey showered, shaved, and spat toothpaste. At 0400 they walked into\r\nthe Medical Officer\'s door. A red-eyed corpsman reached for a manometer\r\nand the three men began taking their clothes off. Fifteen minutes later\r\nthe doctor, a corpulent, middle-aged man in disgustingly good humor for\r\n0400, walked in with a cheery good morning. He poked and tapped while\r\nthe corpsman drew blood samples.\r\n\r\n"Turn your face and cough," he said.\r\n\r\n"You think I\'m going to develop hernia from riding a nightmare?"\r\nHagstrom growled. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
"You did all this yesterday."\r\n\r\n"An ounce of prevention," the doctor said cheerfully.\r\n\r\n"A pound of bull," van den Burg grunted.\r\n\r\n"Now boys, what if that got in the papers?" asked a voice from the\r\ndoorway.\r\n\r\n"Damn the papers!" they greeted the general.\r\n\r\n"Do we get breakfast?" Ar\xc3\xa9chaga asked.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll take acceleration better without it."\r\n\r\n"Tell my stomach that."\r\n\r\n"Bend over the table," the doctor said.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my aching back," Hagstrom moaned.\r\n\r\n"That\'s not the exact target, but you\'re close. And awaaaay we go," the\r\ndoctor chanted as he drove the needle home.\r\n\r\nEach man received an injection of antibiotics and drank a paper cupful\r\nof anise-flavored liquid.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t we get wrapped in cellophane?" Ar\xc3\xa9chaga asked.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll be pure enough when that purgative goes through you."\r\n\r\nThey dressed and rode in the general\'s staff car to the base of the\r\ngantry. As the car stopped, the general said, "Well boys, I hope you\r\ndon\'t expect a speech."\r\n\r\n"We love you too, Pop," van den Burg said. They shook hands and\r\nstepped aboard the gantry platform. Hagstrom muttered and they faced a\r\ntelescopic TV pickup with mechanical grins until the rising platform\r\nshielded them.\r\n\r\nEach had his own control board and each was prepared to take over\r\nanother\'s duties if necessary. They took off the baggy coveralls and\r\ntossed them into lockers. Ar\xc3\xa9chaga\'s made an odd clunk. He hitched up\r\nhis shorts and turned quickly. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
They checked each other\'s instruments\r\nand settings, then went to their couches. A clock with an extra hand\r\nticked the seconds off backward.\r\n\r\n"We\'re ready," van den Burg muttered into a throat mike.\r\n\r\n"So\'re we," a speaker answered tinnily.\r\n\r\nThe second hand began its final revolution in reverse. With blastoff it\r\nwould begin turning in its proper direction. There was a clang as the\r\nwater hose dropped its magnetic nipple. The rumbling became louder and\r\nthe G meter climbed to 3.5. After several minutes the needle dropped\r\nsuddenly to 2. Ar\xc3\xa9chaga tried to lift his head but decided it wasn\'t\r\nworth the effort. The rumbling stopped and he knew the sudden panic of\r\nfree fall.\r\n\r\nHe made the adjustment which controlled arc flights and free fall\r\nparachute jumps had taught him and unstrapped. The speaker\'s tinny\r\nvoice read off numbers which they transmuted into turns of two wheels\r\nwith axes at right angles. Since the weight of the remaining reaction\r\nmass could not be calculated with exactitude they spun by trial and\r\nerror the last few turns until a telescope parallel to the thrust axis\r\nzeroed on a third magnitude pinpoint whose spectroscope matched the\r\ntinny voice\'s demands.\r\n\r\n"Why such a razzy speaker?" Hagstrom groused as he spun a wheel.\r\n\r\n"A paper cone gets mush-mouthed in 3 G\'s," van den Burg grunted.\r\n\r\nAr\xc3\xa9chaga set the pump for 1.6 seconds at four liters. He nodded.\r\nHagstrom pulled the rods. Weight returned briefly; then they floated\r\nagain. Van den Burg belched. The tinny voice approved, and Hagstrom\r\ndropped the cadmium rods again. "Anybody for canasta?" Ar\xc3\xa9chaga asked.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first day nobody ate. Overtrained, blas\xc3\xa9--still, it _was_ the\r\nfirst time and the stomach had yet to make peace with the intellect.\r\nThe second day Ar\xc3\xa9chaga broke the pantry door seals and studied the\r\ninvoices. He gave a groan of disgust and went back to sleep. With\r\nsomething solid strapped in on top it was almost easy.\r\n\r\nOn the third day van den Burg put bags of steak and string beans into\r\nthe hi-fi oven and strapped himself into a chair. He used chopsticks to\r\nsnare the globules of soup and coffee which escaped from hooded cups\r\ndespite all precautions.\r\n\r\n"How is it?" Hagstrom asked.\r\n\r\n"It\'d taste better if you\'d come down and sit on the same side of the\r\nship."\r\n\r\nHuman Factors had recommended that table and chairs be situated in one\r\nplane and resemble the real thing. The sight of one\'s fellow man at\r\nease in an impossible position was not considered conducive to good\r\ndigestion.\r\n\r\nHagstrom dived across the room and in a moment Ar\xc3\xa9chaga joined him.\r\nAr\xc3\xa9chaga sampled the steak and vegetables and turned up his nose. He\r\nbroke seals and resurrected pork, beef, onions, garlic, and sixteen\r\nseparate spices. There was far too much _sancoche_ for one meal when he\r\nwas through.\r\n\r\n"What\'ll you do with the rest of it?" Hagstrom asked.\r\n\r\n"Eat it tomorrow."\r\n\r\n"It\'ll spoil."\r\n\r\n"In this embalmed atmosphere?" Ar\xc3\xa9chaga asked. He sampled the stew.\r\n"Irradiated food--pfui!" He went to his locker and extracted a jar.\r\n\r\n"What\'s that?" van den Burg asked.\r\n\r\n"_Salsa picante._"\r\n\r\n"Literal translation: shredding sauce," Hagstrom volunteered.\r\n"Guaranteed to do just that to your taste buds."\r\n\r\n"Where\'d you get it?" 

=== Chunk 5 ===
van den Burg asked.\r\n\r\n"Out of my locker."\r\n\r\n"Not sterile, I presume."\r\n\r\n"You\'re darn tootin\' it ain\'t. I\'m not going to have the only tasty\r\nitem on the menu run through that irradiator."\r\n\r\n"Out with it!" 

=== Chunk 6 ===
van den Burg roared.\r\n\r\n"Oh, come now," Ar\xc3\xa9chaga said. He poured _salsa_ over the stew and took\r\na gigantic bite.\r\n\r\n"I hate to pull my rank but you know what the pill rollers have to say\r\nabout unsterilized food."\r\n\r\n"Oh, all right," Ar\xc3\xa9chaga said morosely. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
He emptied the jar into the\r\ndisposal and activated the locks. The air loss gave the garbage a\r\ngradually diverging orbit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe began cranking the aligning wheels. When the stars stopped spinning,\r\nhe threw a switch and began reading rapidly into a mike. Finished, he\r\nhanded the mike to Hagstrom. Hagstrom gave his report and passed it to\r\nvan den Burg.\r\n\r\nAr\xc3\xa9chaga rewound the tape and threaded the spool into another machine.\r\nHe strapped himself before a telescope and began twiddling knobs.\r\nOutside, a microwave dish waggled. He pressed a trigger on one of the\r\nknobs. Tape screamed through the transmitter pickup.\r\n\r\n"Make it?" Hagstrom asked.\r\n\r\n"It began to wander off toward the end," Ar\xc3\xa9chaga said. He switched\r\nthe transmitter off. The temperature had risen in the four minutes\r\nnecessary to squirt and the sunward side was getting uncomfortable even\r\nthrough the insulation. Hagstrom began spinning the wheel.\r\n\r\nAr\xc3\xa9chaga fed tape into the receiver and played it back slowly. There\r\nwas background noise for a minute then, "ETV One. Read you loud and\r\nclear." There was a pause; then a familiar voice came in, "Glad to hear\r\nfrom you, boys. Thule and Kergeulen stations tracked you for several\r\nhours. Best shot so far. Less than two seconds of corrective firing,"\r\nthe general said proudly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHagstrom and van den Burg returned to their books. Ar\xc3\xa9chaga snapped off\r\nthe player and went into the pantry. The light dimmed and brightened as\r\nthe spin exposed and occulted its accumulator. He filed the information\r\nsubconsciously for his revision list and glared at the provisions.\r\n\r\nShelves were filled--meats, vegetables, fruits, all held in place by\r\nelastic netting. The skin-tight plastic was invisible in the dim light.\r\nAr\xc3\xa9chaga began to feel prickly as the lack of ventilation wrapped him\r\nin a layer of steam. All that food right out in the open and no flies.\r\nIt just isn\'t right, he thought. He shrugged and picked out three\r\napples.\r\n\r\n"Keep the doctor away?" he asked as he swam back into the control room.\r\nHagstrom nodded and caught one.\r\n\r\n"Thanks, I\'m not hungry," van den Burg said. He put his book under the\r\nnet and began taking his own pulse.\r\n\r\n"Something wrong?" Ar\xc3\xa9chaga asked.\r\n\r\n"Must have been something I ate," he grunted.\r\n\r\nHagstrom eyed his half-eaten apple with distaste. "I must have eaten\r\nsome too." He threw the apple into the disposal and belched. Ar\xc3\xa9chaga\r\nlooked at him worriedly.\r\n\r\nTwo days passed. Hagstrom and van den Burg sampled food fretfully.\r\nAr\xc3\xa9chaga evacuated the disposal twice in six hours and watched them\r\nworriedly. "Are you guys thinking the same thing I am?" 

=== Chunk 8 ===
he asked.\r\n\r\nVan den Burg stared for a moment. "Looks that way, doesn\'t it?"\r\n\r\nHagstrom started to say something, then dived for a bag and vomited.\r\nIn a moment he wiped his mouth and turned a pale face toward Ar\xc3\xa9chaga.\r\n"This is how it started with the others, isn\'t it?" he said.\r\n\r\nAr\xc3\xa9chaga began talking into the recorder. He killed spin long enough\r\nto squirt. In a few minutes the razzy speaker again made them part\r\nof Earth. "--and hope for the best," the general was saying. "Maybe\r\nyou\'ll adjust after a few days." The voice faded into background noise\r\nand Ar\xc3\xa9chaga turned off the player.\r\n\r\n"Any ideas?" he asked. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
"You know as much medicine as I do."\r\n\r\nVan den Burg and Hagstrom shook their heads listlessly.\r\n\r\n"There\'s got to be a reason," Ar\xc3\xa9chaga insisted. "How do you feel?"\r\n\r\n"Hungry. Like I hadn\'t eaten for two weeks."\r\n\r\n"The same," Hagstrom said. "Every time I eat it lays like a ton of\r\nlead. I guess we just aren\'t made for zero grav."\r\n\r\n"Doesn\'t seem to be hitting me as quickly as it did you two," Ar\xc3\xa9chaga\r\nmused. "Can I get you anything?" 

=== Chunk 10 ===
They shook their heads. He went into\r\nthe library and began skimming through the medical spools.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned the others slept fitfully. He ate a banana and\r\nwondered guiltily if his _salsa_ had anything to do with it. He\r\ndecided it didn\'t. The other crews had died the same way without any\r\nnon-sterile food aboard. He floated back into the pantry and stared at\r\nthe mounds of provisions until the mugginess drove him out.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThree more days passed. Hagstrom and van den Burg grew steadily weaker.\r\nAr\xc3\xa9chaga waited expectantly but his own appetite didn\'t fail. He\r\nadvanced dozens of weird hypotheses--racial immunity, mutations. Even\r\nto his non-medical mind the theories were fantastic. Why should a\r\nmestizo take zero grav better than a European? He munched on a celery\r\nstalk and wished he were back on Earth, preferably in Mexico where food\r\nwas worth eating.\r\n\r\nThen it hit him.\r\n\r\nHe looked at the others. _They\'ll die anyway._ He went to work. Three\r\nhours later he prodded Hagstrom and van den Burg into wakefulness and\r\nforced a murky liquid into them. They gagged weakly, but he persisted\r\nuntil each had taken a swallow. Thirty minutes later he forced a cup of\r\nsoup into each. They dozed but he noted with satisfaction that their\r\npulses were stronger.\r\n\r\nFour hours later Hagstrom awoke. "I\'m hungry," he complained. Ar\xc3\xa9chaga\r\nfed him. The Netherlander came to a little later, and Ar\xc3\xa9chaga was run\r\nragged feeding them for the next two days. On the third day they were\r\npreparing their own meals.\r\n\r\n"How come it didn\'t hit you?" van dan Burg asked.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," Ar\xc3\xa9chaga said. "Just lucky, I guess."\r\n\r\n"What was that stuff you gave us?" Hagstrom asked.\r\n\r\n"What stuff?" Ar\xc3\xa9chaga said innocently. "By the way, I raised hell\r\nwith the inventory getting you guys back in condition. Would you mind\r\ngoing into the far pantry and straightening things up a little?"\r\n\r\nThey went, pulling their way down the passage to the rearmost food\r\nlocker. "There\'s something very funny going on," Hagstrom said.\r\n\r\nVan den Burg inspected the stocks and the inventory list suspiciously.\r\n"Looks all right to me. I wonder why he wanted us to check it." They\r\nlooked at each other.\r\n\r\n"You thinking what I\'m thinking?" Hagstrom asked.\r\n\r\nVan den Burg nodded. They pulled themselves silently along the\r\npassageway back to the control room. Ar\xc3\xa9chaga was speaking softly into\r\nthe recorder, his back to the entrance. Hagstrom cleared his throat and\r\nthe black-haired little man spun guiltily. Van den Burg reached for the\r\nplayback switch.\r\n\r\n"It\'s just a routine report," Ar\xc3\xa9chaga protested.\r\n\r\n"We\'re curious," Hagstrom said.\r\n\r\nThe recorder began playing. "--I should have figured it right from the\r\nstart. If food is so lousy the flies won\'t touch it, then humans have\r\nno business eating it."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the food got to do with it?" Hagstrom asked.\r\n\r\n"Quiet!" van den Burg hissed.\r\n\r\n"--got by all right on Earth where there was plenty of reinfection,\r\nbut when you sealed us in this can without a bug in a million miles--"\r\nAr\xc3\xa9chaga\'s voice continued.\r\n\r\n"If food can\'t rot it can\'t digest either. Irradiate it--burn the last\r\nbit of life out of it--and then give us a whopping dose of antibiotics\r\nuntil there isn\'t one bug in our alimentary tracts from one end to the\r\nother. It\'s no wonder we were starving in the midst of plenty.

"\r\n\r\n"Wait a minute. 

=== Chunk 12 ===
How come you didn\'t get sick?" Hagstrom asked.\r\n\r\nAr\xc3\xa9chaga flipped a switch and the recorder ground to a stop.\r\n"I reinfected myself with a swallow of _salsa picante_--good,\r\nold-fashioned, unsanitary chili sauce."\r\n\r\nA horrible suspicion was growing in van den Burg\'s mind. "What did you\r\ngive us?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"You left me little choice when you threw out my _salsa_," Ar\xc3\xa9chaga\r\nsaid. "Why do you have to be so curious?"\r\n\r\n"What was it?" van den Burg demanded.\r\n\r\n"I scraped a little salsa scum from the inside of the disposal. It made\r\na fine culture. What did you think I gave you?"\r\n\r\n"I\'d rather not answer that," van den Burg said weakly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
