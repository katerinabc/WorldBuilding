Although\r\nThatcher Blitt was, by the standards of his time, an extremely\r\nsuccessful man financially, this was not considered _real_ distinction.\r\nUnfortunately for Blitt, it never has been.\r\n\r\nThe history books do not record the names of the most successful\r\nmerchants of the past unless they happened by chance to have been\r\nconnected with famous men of the time. Thus Croesus is remembered\r\nlargely for his contributions to famous Romans and successful armies.\r\nAnd Haym Solomon, a similarly wealthy man, would have been long\r\nforgotten had he not also been a financial mainstay of the American\r\nRevolution and consorted with famous, if impoverished, statesmen.\r\n\r\nSo if Thatcher Blitt was distinct among men, the distinction was not\r\nimmediately apparent. He was a small, gaunt, fragile man who had the\r\nkind of face and bearing that are perfect for movie crowd scenes.\r\nAbsolutely forgettable. Yet Thatcher Blitt was one of the foremost\r\nbusinessmen of his time. For he was president and founder of that noble\r\ninstitution, Genealogy, Inc.\r\n\r\nThatcher Blitt was not yet 25 when he made the discovery which was to\r\nmake him among the richest men of his time. His discovery was, like all\r\ngreat ones, obvious yet profound. He observed that every person had a\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCarrying on with this thought, it followed inevitably that every father\r\nhad a father, and so on. In fact, thought Blitt, when you considered\r\nthe matter rightly, everyone alive was the direct descendant of untold\r\nnumbers of fathers, down through the ages, all descending, one after\r\nanother, father to son. And so backward, unquestionably, into the\r\nunrecognizable and perhaps simian fathers of the past.\r\n\r\nThis thought, on the face of it not particularly profound, struck\r\nyoung Blitt like a blow. He saw that since each man had a father, and\r\nso on and so on, it ought to be possible to construct the genealogy of\r\nevery person now alive. In short, it should be possible to trace your\r\nfamily back, father by father, to the beginning of time.\r\n\r\nAnd of course it was. For that was the era of the time scanner. And\r\nwith a time scanner, it would be possible to document your family tree\r\nwith perfect accuracy. You could find out exactly from whom you had\r\nsprung.\r\n\r\nAnd so Thatcher Blitt made his fortune. He saw clearly at the beginning\r\nwhat most of us see only now, and he patented it. He was aware not only\r\nof the deep-rooted sense of snobbishness that exists in many people,\r\nbut also of the simple yet profound force of curiosity. Who exactly,\r\none says to oneself, _was_ my forty-times-great-great-grandfather? A\r\nRoman Legionary? A Viking? A pyramid builder? One of Xenophon\'s Ten\r\nThousand? Or was he, perhaps (for it is always possible), Alexander the\r\nGreat?\r\n\r\nThatcher Blitt had a product to sell. And sell he did, for other\r\nreasons that he alone had noted at the beginning. The races of mankind\r\nhave twisted and turned with incredible complexity over the years; the\r\nnumbers of people have been enormous.\r\n\r\nWith thirty thousand years in which to work, it was impossible that\r\nthere was not, somewhere along the line, a famous ancestor for\r\neverybody. A minor king would often suffice, or even a general in some\r\nforgotten army. And if these direct ancestors were not enough, it was\r\nfairly simple to establish close blood kinship with famous men. The\r\nblood lines of Man, you see, begin with a very few people. In all of\r\nancient Greece, in the time of Pericles, there were only a few thousand\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\nSeeing all this, Thatcher Blitt became a busy man. It was necessary not\r\nonly to patent his idea, but to produce the enormous capital needed\r\nto found a large organization. The cost of the time scanner was at\r\nfirst prohibitive, but gradually that obstacle was overcome, only for\r\nThatcher to find that the government for many years prevented him from\r\nusing it. Yet Blitt was indomitable. And eventually, after years of\r\nheart-rending waiting, Genealogy, Inc., began operations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was a tremendous success. Within months, the very name of the\r\ncompany and its taut slogan, "An Ancestor for Everybody," became\r\nhousehold words. There was but one immediate drawback. It soon became\r\napparent that, without going back very far into the past, it was\r\nsometimes impossible to tell who was really the next father in line.\r\nThe mothers were certain, but the fathers were something else again.\r\nThis was a ponderable point.\r\n\r\nBut Blitt refused to be discouraged. He set various electronic\r\nengineers to work on the impasse and a solution was found. An ingenious\r\ndevice which tested blood electronically through the scanner--based\r\non the different sine waves of the blood groups--saved the day. That\r\ninvention was the last push Genealogy, Inc., was ever to need. It\r\nrolled on to become one of the richest and, for a long while, most\r\nexclusive corporations in the world.\r\n\r\nYet it was still many years before Thatcher Blitt himself had time to\r\nrest. There were patent infringements to be fought, new developments\r\nin the labs to be watched, new ways to be found to make the long and\r\narduous task of father-tracing easier and more economical. Hence he was\r\nwell past sixty when he at last had time to begin considering himself.\r\n\r\nHe had become by this time a moderately offensive man. Surrounded as\r\nhe had been all these years by pomp and luxury, by impressive names\r\nand extraordinary family trees, he had succumbed at last. He became\r\nunbearably name-conscious.\r\n\r\nHe began by regrouping his friends according to their ancestries. His\r\ninfrequent parties were characterized by his almost Parliamentarian\r\nsystem of seating. No doubt, all this had been in Thatcher Blitt to\r\nbegin with--it may well be, in perhaps varying quantities, in all of\r\nus--but it grew with him, prospered with him. Yet in all those years he\r\nnever once inspected his own forebears.\r\n\r\nYou may well ask, was he afraid? One answers, one does not know. But at\r\nany rate, the fact remains that Thatcher Blitt, at the age of 67, was\r\none of the few rich men in the world who did not know who exactly their\r\nancestors had been.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd so, at last, we come to the day when Thatcher Blitt was sitting\r\nalone in his office, one languid hand draped vacantly over his brow,\r\nlistening with deep satisfaction to the hum and click of the enormous\r\noperations which were going on in the building around him.\r\n\r\nWhat moved him that day remains uncertain. Perhaps it was that, from\r\nwhere he was sitting, he could see row upon row of action pictures of\r\nfamous men which had been taken from his time scanners. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
Or perhaps it\r\nwas simply that this profound question had been gnawing at him all\r\nthese years, deeper and deeper, and on this day broke out into the\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nBut whatever the reason, at 11:02 that morning, he leaped vitally from\r\nhis chair. He summoned Cathcart, his chief assistant, and gave him the\r\nimmortal command.\r\n\r\n"Cathcart!" he grated, stung to the core of his being. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
"Who am I?"\r\n\r\nCathcart rushed off to find out.\r\n\r\nThere followed some of the most taut and fateful days in the brilliant\r\nhistory of Genealogy, Inc. Father-tracing is, of course, a painstaking\r\nbusiness. But it was not long before word had begun to filter out to\r\ninterested people.\r\n\r\nThe first interesting discovery made was a man called Blott, in\r\neighteenth century England. (No explanation was ever given for the\r\nname\'s alteration from Blott to Blitt. Certain snide individuals\r\ntook this to mean that the name had been changed as a means to avoid\r\nprosecution, or some such, and immediately began making light remarks\r\nabout the Blotts on old Blitt\'s escutcheon.) This Blott had the\r\ndistinction of having been a wineseller of considerable funds.\r\n\r\nThis reputedly did not sit well with Thatcher Blitt. Merchants, he\r\nsnapped, however successful, are not worthy of note. He wanted empire\r\nbuilders. He wanted, at the very least, a name he had heard about. A\r\nname that appeared in the histories.\r\n\r\nHis workers furiously scanned back into the past.\r\n\r\nMonths went by before the next name appeared. In 9th century England,\r\nthere was a wandering minstrel named John (last name unprintable) who\r\nachieved considerable notoriety as a ballad singer, before dying an\r\nunnatural death in the boudoir of a lady of high fashion. Although\r\nthe details of this man\'s life were of extreme interest, they did\r\nnot impress the old man. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
He was, on the contrary, rather shaken. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
A\r\nminstrel. And a rogue to boot.\r\n\r\nThere were shakeups in Genealogy, Inc. Cathcart was replaced by a man\r\nnamed Jukes, a highly competent man despite his interesting family\r\nname. Jukes forged ahead full steam past the birth of Christ (no\r\nrelation). But he was well into ancient Egypt before the search began\r\nto take on the nature of a crisis.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUp until then, there was simply nobody. Or to be more precise, nobody\r\nbut _nobodies_. It was incredible, all the laws of chance were against\r\nit, but there was, actually, not a single ancestor of note. And no\r\nway of faking one, for Thatcher Blitt couldn\'t be fooled by his own\r\nmethods. What there was was simply an unending line of peasants,\r\nserfs, an occasional foot soldier or leather worker. Past John the\r\nballad-singer, there was no one at all worth reporting to the old man.\r\n\r\nThis situation would not continue, of course. There were so few\r\nfamilies for men to spring from. The entire Gallic nation, for example,\r\na great section of present-day France, sprang from the family of one\r\nlone man in the north of France in the days before Christ. Every native\r\nFrenchman, therefore, was at least the son of a king. It was impossible\r\nfor Thatcher Blitt to be less.\r\n\r\nSo the hunt went on from day to day, past ancient Greece, past\r\nJarmo, past the wheel and metals and farming and on even past all\r\ncivilization, outward and backward into the cold primordial wastes of\r\nnorthern Germany.\r\n\r\nAnd still there was nothing. Though Jukes lived in daily fear of losing\r\nhis job, there was nothing to do but press on. In Germany, he reduced\r\nBlitt\'s ancestor to a slovenly little man who was one of only three\r\nmen in the entire tribe, or family, one of three in an area which now\r\ncontains millions. But Blitt\'s ancestor, true to form, was simply a\r\nmember of the tribe. As was his father before him.\r\n\r\nYet onward it went. Westward back into the French caves, southward\r\ninto Spain and across the unrecognizable Mediterranean into a verdant\r\nNorth Africa, backward in time past even the Cro-Magnons, and yet ever\r\nbackward, 30,000 years, 35,000, with old Blitt reduced now practically\r\nto gibbering and still never an exceptional forebear.\r\n\r\nThere came a time when Jukes had at last, inevitably, to face the old\r\nman. He had scanned back as far as he could. The latest ancestor he had\r\nunearthed for Blitt was a hairy creature who did not walk erect. And\r\nyet, even here, Blitt refused to concede.\r\n\r\n"It may be," he howled, "it _must_ be that my ancestor _was_ the first\r\nman to walk erect or light a fire--to do _something_."\r\n\r\nIt was not until Jukes pointed out that all those things had been\r\nalready examined and found hopeless that Blitt finally gave in. Blitt\r\nwas a relative, of course, of the first man to stand erect, the man\r\nwith the first human brain. But so was everybody else on the face of\r\nthe Earth. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
There was truly nowhere else to explore. What would be found\r\nnow would be only the common history of mankind.\r\n\r\nBlitt retired to his chambers and refused to be seen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe story went the rounds, as such stories will. And it was then\r\nat last, after 40,000 years of insignificance, that the name of\r\nBlitt found everlasting distinction. The story was picked up, fully\r\ndocumented, by psychologists and geneticists of the time, and inserted\r\ninto textbooks as a profound commentary on the forces of heredity. The\r\nname of Thatcher Blitt in particular has become famous, has persisted\r\nuntil this day. For he is the only man yet discovered, or ever likely\r\nto be discovered, with this particular distinction.\r\n\r\nIn 40,000 years of scanner-recorded history, the blood line of Blitt\r\n(or Blott) never once produced an exceptional man.\r\n\r\nThat record is unsurpassed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
