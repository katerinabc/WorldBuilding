]\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Weedlemeyer sputtered in his eagerness, making large gestures\r\nwith his hands.\r\n\r\n"Of course!" he shouted, his accent becoming thicker with his\r\nexcitement. "It is lunacy to think only man will increase in his\r\nintelligence! Animals will too--ya, und insects! It will be a fierce\r\ncompetition for the earth be--man and the animals!"\r\n\r\nJon Egan, science reporter and man of all work for the _Carolina\r\nBugle_, yawned and searched vainly through littered pockets for a\r\ncigarette that wasn\'t there. He had heard all this before.\r\n\r\n"Wish you\'d do something about my dog Spurious," he muttered. "He is\r\nthe dumbest--"\r\n\r\n"Stop annoying me with that fool hound!" Professor Weedlemeyer said\r\ncrossly. He lifted his voice in a bellow. "Myrtle! Myrtle--where is the\r\nbeer?"\r\n\r\nJon Egan brightened. The swinging door to the kitchen was opened by a\r\nfoot, and a tray with beer glasses and bottles came through, followed\r\nby Myrtle Weedlemeyer, the professor\'s daughter.\r\n\r\nDraw no hasty conclusions from the unfortunate name, product of\r\nabsent-minded and uneclectic parental haste. Myrtle Weedlemeyer was\r\nas beautiful as the sun. She was tall, with a magnificent lush body\r\nwhose curves were a constant threat to the flimsy material seeking to\r\nrestrain them.\r\n\r\nShe had gleaming black hair falling in smooth waves to a pair of\r\nwondrously formed shoulders. She had an oval face with skin as lambent\r\nas pearl and, as a final touch, a pair of huge, incredible blue eyes\r\nthat were alight with internal fires.\r\n\r\nShe crossed the room, balancing the tray of drinks effortlessly,\r\nand the fluid motion of her body made Jon Egan\'s breath stop in his\r\nthroat. As happened every time he saw this, he realized all over again\r\nthat the reason he came out here was to see her, not to listen to the\r\nProfessor\'s perpetual monolog on I.Q.\r\n\r\n"... man of the future," Weedlemeyer was droning, "will undoubtedly a\r\nlarge, bulging crown have--hairless of course--und his jaws will shrink\r\nin proportion."\r\n\r\nMyrtle sat down on the divan across from Egan, crossed sleekly rounded\r\nlegs and turned the full voltage of her eyes on the newspaper man.\r\nHe shuddered, downed half a glass of beer in a frenzied gulp that\r\nbackfired and nearly choked him to death.\r\n\r\nWhen he came out of the red fog of coughing, Myrtle sat beside him\r\npatting him on the back. The warmth of her closeness and the fragrant\r\nscent of her sent his blood pressure soaring.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s go to the movies," he mumbled, catching her hand and getting up.\r\n\r\n"Goody."\r\n\r\nShe snuggled against him. Professor Weedlemeyer regarded them sourly.\r\n\r\n"I think I take back what I said about the intelligence of humans,"\r\nhe grumbled. "Movies--when science offers you the world! Bah, less\r\nintelligence than donkeys you have."\r\n\r\n"You keep the science, daddy," Myrtle said generously. "I\'ll do better\r\nwith what I have."\r\n\r\nShe turned her eyes on Egan again and the reporter, feeling his bones\r\nbegin to soften like butter, agreed with no mental reservations.\r\n\r\n"How sharper than a serpent\'s tooth is an ungrateful child!"\r\nWeedlemeyer groaned. "I tell you, I bet I could take a cat--a\r\ndonkey--and make him smarter as you two!"\r\n\r\n"Yeh? How?" Egan said.\r\n\r\n"A nice question." Weedlemeyer\'s eyes went thoughtful. "Of course the\r\nbrain is not so highly convoluted. In generations, of course--but\r\nthere is no time." A new thought struck him. "Suppose an animal were\r\nsuddenly to have the mind and the thoughts of a man. What would he do?"\r\n\r\n"I am reminded of a story," Egan said, grinning. "A donkey was lost and\r\nnobody could find him. Then the village half-wit appeared, leading the\r\nbeast."\r\n\r\n"I know!" Weedlemeyer snapped. "You too could imagine yourself a\r\ndonkey--without trouble. So to the movies go--donkeys!"\r\n\r\nGiggling inanely, they pattered off.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn ten minutes Egan had forgotten the conversation. In two weeks it had\r\nfaded, it seemed, forever from his consciousness. The professor, of\r\ncourse, continued his interminable monologue on intelligence.\r\n\r\n"... not only the learning ability," he would drone earnestly, pounding\r\nit home with a pudgy fist, "but sagacity--the ability to apply what\r\nis learned. How many absent-minded professors do you know who have\r\nmemorized the encyclopedia, but who cannot fix a leaking hot water\r\nbottle? They lack sagacity--they cannot apply their learning!"\r\n\r\nBut Jon Egan was much too much taken up with the gorgeous Myrtle to\r\nbe amused by Professor Weedlemeyer\'s mutterings. He was running a\r\nconstant fever and his hard-shelled bachelordom was crumbling under the\r\noxy-acteylene flame of her incredible feminine appeal.\r\n\r\nAs competition, of course, he had only the entire campus--the male\r\nportion of it--plus a goodly number of the younger faculty members. But\r\nwith rare judgment, or the ability to spot a dying duck when she saw\r\none, Myrtle seemed actually to favor him. Amazing girl!\r\n\r\nShe kissed him on the porch swing, she held his hand in the movies, she\r\nmurmured low into his ear.\r\n\r\n"I hate my name. Myrtle Weedlemeyer--ugh! 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Sounds like something you\r\nspray on lawns."\r\n\r\nJon Egan gulped. He plunged.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you change it?" he trembled. "Myrtle Egan sounds pretty\r\nnice."\r\n\r\n"_Darling!_" said Myrtle.\r\n\r\nThe kiss she gave him topped all known scorch records and reduced him\r\nto a throbbing cinder. So, engaged officially, they went hand in hand\r\nto seek Papa Weedlemeyer and break the news.\r\n\r\nThey found him peering myopically through a comparison microscope.\r\n\r\n"So?" he grunted. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
"Am I supposed to be surprised? Any donkey could have\r\nseen it coming long ago. You will all the time fight and be perfectly\r\nhappy and miserable. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Now away go and talk your foolishness and let me\r\nwork."\r\n\r\nThe roseate daze in which Myrtle and Egan were now enveloped left no\r\nroom for curiosity about the nature of Professor Weedlemeyer\'s work. So\r\nit came to them with as much a shock as it did to anyone else when it\r\nfinally happened.\r\n\r\nThey were returning from the movies, strolling hand in hand, this warm\r\nspring night. Jasmine and magnolia were in full, fragrant bloom and\r\nthe night air was alive with romance. On a street corner a political\r\nmeeting was in full progress. Senator Foghorn was running for\r\nre-election. The senator was speaking in a quiet voice which could not\r\nbe heard for more than three miles.\r\n\r\n"... to perpetuate our gr-r-e-a-a-t form of government and our\r\ngr-r-e-a-a-t Constitution, the most perfect political work ever handed\r\ndown to mankind by Almighty God. Anybody who dares to change one word\r\nof that sacred document is a traitor to the ideals of our gr-r-e-a-a-t\r\ncountry, to our magnificent boys who fought and gave their lives and to\r\nthe flower of our lovely womenhood, the wives and mothers and sisters\r\nof all of us...."\r\n\r\nThe senator could go on like this indefinitely, saying nothing with\r\nunsurpassed volume and untiring energy. Myrtle and Egan heard him as\r\nthey left the movie house and his voice grew in volume as they drew\r\ncloser to the street corner meeting.\r\n\r\n"... democracy!" roared the senator. "The greatest gift ever handed\r\ndown to mankind by Almighty God, that gives every man of us a fair and\r\nsquare chance at life, liberty and the pur-suit of happiness!"\r\n\r\nHe paused to take a breath and in that tiny moment of silence a new\r\nvoice cut in.\r\n\r\n"That\'s all right for you!" said the voice. "But what about us?"\r\n\r\nCut off in mid-breath, the senator\'s jowls remained adroop, his mouth\r\nopen like a carp\'s. He caught his breath.\r\n\r\n"Who said that?" he roared.\r\n\r\n"I did," replied the voice.\r\n\r\n"Come out here where I can see you!"\r\n\r\nThere was a rippling and a pushing in the crowd and a sudden frenzied\r\nblat of voices. Then a woman screamed shrilly and there was a hurried\r\nmass movement to get away from the focal point of the moment.\r\n\r\n"What\'s going on there?" bellowed the senator. "I said, \'who said\r\nthat?\'"\r\n\r\n"I did!" snapped the voice and the next moment a big gray mule reared\r\nout of the crowd and planted its front hoofs on the speaker\'s platform.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA gurgle died in the senator\'s throat. His eyes bulged out glassily.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got \'em again," he muttered, passing a shaking hand before his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n"No, you haven\'t," said the mule coldly. "And you haven\'t answered my\r\nquestion. Democracy is all right for you humans, but what about us\r\nmules? We do all the work and what do we get? 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Do we get a fair crack at\r\nthat life, liberty and pursuit of happiness you like to talk about?"\r\n\r\nSenator Foghorn fell backwards off the platform. The sheriff and the\r\nmayor, who had been retreating all the time the mule was speaking,\r\nscrambled hastily down and fled for their lives, abandoning their\r\nhapless political colleague. Women screamed wildly and there was a vast\r\ntrampling of feet as the crowd left.\r\n\r\nOn the outskirts, Jon Egan pulled Myrtle hastily into a doorway to let\r\nthe maddened throng stream fast. The girl had one palm clapped over\r\nluscious lips to keep the hysterical laughter bottled up.\r\n\r\n"He\'s done it," she gurgled. "Papa\'s done it."\r\n\r\n"I\'m crazy," Egan whispered. "I\'ve gone crazy and I\'m seeing things."\r\n\r\n"No, you\'re not, darling," Myrtle said prosaically. "I see it too, and\r\nI\'m not crazy. It\'s poppa. He warned us and we wouldn\'t listen."\r\n\r\nThe mule was left alone on the deserted corner, except for the\r\nrecumbent, blimp-like figure of the senator. The animal took its\r\nfeet down from the platform, moved around it to look at the prone\r\npolitician. As the animal\'s investigating nose snuffed at the senator\'s\r\nface, he came to life with a jerk, loosed an unsenatorial howl of\r\nterror and, rolling to his hands and knees, scuttled off like a giant\r\ncrab.\r\n\r\nThe mule cocked a long ear after him and something suspiciously like\r\nlaughter bubbled in its throat. Then it ambled off into the darkness\r\nand was gone.\r\n\r\n"Come on," Jon Egan pulled Myrtle out of the doorway. "We\'ve got to\r\nget home and see what\'s happened to your father!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, dad\'s all right," Myrtle assured him. "He can take care of\r\nhimself."\r\n\r\n"Maybe," Egan said grimly. "But he may have bitten off more than he can\r\nchew."\r\n\r\nThe college town was a bedlam of running, yelling people. They were\r\nturning out with shotguns, horse-pistols (no mule pistols being\r\navailable) and fire-hoses.\r\n\r\nThe campus, however, was deserted and when Jon Egan and Myrtle got\r\nthere, some of Egan\'s forebodings were suddenly made plain. The house\r\nwas all but wrecked. Furniture had been knocked every which way, a\r\nlot of it was broken, a door hung askew on one hinge, the professor\'s\r\nlaboratory was an untidy sea of broken glass and apparatus. Of the\r\nprofessor himself there was no sign.\r\n\r\n"They\'ve k-kidnapped him!" Myrtle gasped.\r\n\r\n"What would a mule want with your father?" Egan puzzled.\r\n\r\nThe answer to that was more fantastic than anyone could have believed.\r\nA night of searching led them at last to the open countryside, where\r\nsome of the remaining plantations struggled to retain the last shreds\r\nof their grandeur amongst the crowding tenant farms. And there at last\r\nthey ran the missing Professor Weedlemeyer to earth.\r\n\r\nIt had been a night of terror. A vast army of mules, according to the\r\nfrantic stories, were terrorizing, pillaging, insulting the people\r\nof the town. Several had been shot at, but they apparently were\r\ninvulnerable to bullets.\r\n\r\nJon Egan, recognizing mass hysteria clearly, thought there was probably\r\nonly one mule and he had been seen simultaneously in dozens of places.\r\nAs it happened he was wrong. There were two mules which, under\r\nProfessor Weedlemeyer\'s god-like blundering, had received extra-asinine\r\npowers. And they were very busy on the old Clayburne plantation.\r\n\r\nEgan saw them first as he and the girl pushed through the thin fringe\r\nof timber surrounding the field at the back of the house. He grabbed\r\nMyrtle and pulled her hastily back into concealment behind the moss\r\ndripping live-oaks.\r\n\r\n"What is it?" she whispered.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t show yourself, just look," he breathed. And to himself he added\r\nincredulously, "If I didn\'t know I haven\'t had a drink in two days--"\r\n\r\nOut in the field was the most fantastic, incredible, unbelievable,\r\nwild, irregular, egregious, extraordinary, strange, wonderful,\r\nremarkable, unparalleled, grotesque, bizarre, unconventional, wanton,\r\npeculiar sight they had ever seen. It was also downright queer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was an old wooden ox cart in the field with high wooden wheels.\r\nPerched up in the driver\'s seat were two mules, reins and whip pinned\r\nclumsily in their front hoofs. And at the other end of the reins,\r\nhauling the wagon\'s wooden tongue, were four men, clad in nothing more\r\nthan a bridle and a breech-clout apiece!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Perched in the driver\'s seat of the old wooden ox cart,\r\ntwo mules were driving four men.]\r\n\r\n"They\'ve reversed things!" Myrtle gasped. "The mules driving men!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s democracy," Egan said, grinning a little in spite of himself. But\r\nhe sobered quickly. "Look," he said pointing.\r\n\r\nThe lead man in the team was Professor Weedlemeyer.\r\n\r\nTarzan in a breech-clout is one thing--or Uncas. But a fat and past\r\nmiddle-aged professor has no dignity without his clothes. Professor\r\nWeedlemeyer was a sorry wreck of his normal rubicund self. He was\r\ngasping and disheveled with unexpected physical travail. His mouth\r\nopened for air, his eyes roamed in wild and general search for help.\r\n\r\n"Ooh, poor papa!" Myrtle cried. "We\'ve got to do something, Jon!"\r\n\r\nEgan went back in the underbrush and discovered a couple of heavy tree\r\nlimbs which would serve as clubs. He brought them out.\r\n\r\n"This is probably suicide," he reflected aloud, "but we\'ve got to make\r\na try. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
When I yell--charge \'em!"\r\n\r\nThey crouched like a pair of sprinters ready for the gun and when Egan\r\npanted "_Now!_" they broke cover and charged.\r\n\r\nThe mules whipped long ears and eyes around to cover them. One spoke to\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n"You take \'em, Percy. My heels are sore from kicking human rumps."\r\n\r\nThe mule with the reins tossed them to his fellow and dropped awkwardly\r\noff the wagon seat, nearly falling, but managing to regain its four\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nEgan knew they were licked. What could even a stout club do against the\r\nlethal hoofs of a mule? And a smart mule at that who could probably\r\noutthink both of them.\r\n\r\nBut he kept charging. There was nothing else to do except turn and\r\nrun, which was undignified. Interruption came from an unexpected\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\nThe unhappy Professor Weedlemeyer straightened in his harness and with\r\na flash of the old fire sent his voice at them.\r\n\r\n"Jon! _No!_ The wire--the wire!"\r\n\r\nBefuddled, Jon slacked his racing feet to look aloft where the\r\nprofessor\'s arm pointed. The high tension wire which supplied all the\r\ntown with electricity soared over this field, supported by a many-armed\r\ntower close by.\r\n\r\nEgan didn\'t get it, but the word "wire" had been clear enough in the\r\nprofessor\'s shout. Obeying the impulse, he reversed his field like a\r\nrunning halfback and dashed for the tower.\r\n\r\nAs though sensing danger, the other mule promptly abandoned the wagon,\r\nleaped off and charged for him. The original mule bore down upon\r\nMyrtle. The girl swung her club, catching the animal on its nose.\r\n\r\n"_Ow!_" yelped the mule. "I\'ll fix you for that, you little hinny!

=== Chunk 8 ===
"\r\n\r\nMyrtle dodged him and, gaining the shelter of the oxcart, raced around\r\nit. The men hitched to the team broke loose and scattered in every\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Jon Egan made the latticed tower a jump ahead of his pursuer\r\nand scrambled up the metal ladder like a squirrel. He continued to\r\nclimb until he reached the first of the giant cross arms. There he set\r\nhimself, holding on with one arm and a crooked leg, and swung his club.\r\n\r\nA glass insulator shattered. There was a blinding blue-white flare of\r\nlight accompanied by the smell of scorched insulation and metal. The\r\nwire melted, separated and the two ends fell to earth, trailing sparks\r\nand flame as they went.\r\n\r\n"Watch those live wires!" Egan shouted.\r\n\r\nThey didn\'t hit anybody. But a strange thing happened just the same.\r\nThe mules suddenly stopped what they were doing. Egan\'s mule, whose\r\nforehoofs had been planted well up on the tower ladder suddenly let\r\nhimself drop back to earth as though he had lost interest in the whole\r\nthing and went to grazing.\r\n\r\nThe other mule abruptly stopped chasing Myrtle, lowered his head and\r\nalso began to graze.\r\n\r\nEgan stared down from his tower in cautious bewilderment. But Professor\r\nWeedlemeyer waved him vigorously to earth.\r\n\r\n"It is over, thank heavens," the savant declared shakily, wiping his\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\n"What did it?" Egan asked. "Breaking that wire?"\r\n\r\n"Ya. The current stopped, so it broadcasting the impulses from my house\r\nstopped. Look here.

=== Chunk 9 ===
"\r\n\r\nHe walked straight to one of the now docile mules. In spite of Myrtle\'s\r\nlittle shriek of fear, the professor caught the mule and brought it\r\nback. It came quietly.\r\n\r\n"See here?" the professor revealed a thin chain around the animal\'s\r\nneck, high up, close to the base of the skull. A little metal capsule\r\nwas held firmly against the mousy fur. "That\'s the impulse collector."\r\nHe broke the chain and slipped the gadget into Egan\'s pocket. "Now we\r\nget the other and all is finished. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
I some clothes must get."\r\n\r\n"Explain this donkey business!" Egan cried.\r\n\r\n"Is simple," the professor said wearily. "I could not change the\r\nanimal\'s brains, so I short-circuited them. I plugged in on their\r\nnervous systems with this little gadget and I broadcast the wave\r\npatterns of human brains, which I had from the house recorded. These\r\ntwo mules that received the impulses, like humans acted. That is all."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll say they did," Egan said admiringly. "Uh, look, Professor." He\r\ncast a quick look about him. The other members of the professor\'s team\r\nhad long since disappeared. They three were alone in the field.\r\n\r\n"I\'d advise you to ditch these capsules and from here on be just as\r\nmystified about this outbreak of mule revolution as anybody else. If\r\nyou start to explain--if the town ever catches on that you had anything\r\nto do with it--they\'ll lynch you, do you hear?"\r\n\r\n"Ya," the professor sighed heavily. "I hear. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
Und I am afraid you right\r\ngot it. I say nothing, I know nothing."\r\n\r\n"Good," Egan said firmly. "As for me--" he sighed "--what a story I\r\nmiss! But nobody would believe me anyway, so what\'s the difference?"\r\n\r\n"Hey," said Myrtle, "Forgot about me?"\r\n\r\n"Who could forget you?" Egan muttered. He took her in his arms and\r\nkissed her.\r\n\r\nThe professor cleared his throat, but nobody paid him any attention. He\r\ncoughed and ditto. 

=== Chunk 12 ===
He looked unhappy. He scratched one hairy leg with\r\ntoes of the other.\r\n\r\n"I go some clothes get," he said. Nobody heard him, so he to get some\r\nclothes went.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
