]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe phonovision bell rang. Reed Kendall reached for the switch, not\r\ntaking his eyes off the blueprint that lay on his desk. He spoke\r\nabsently. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
"Yes?"\r\n\r\nThe reply came sharp and cold. "I\'d suggest you stop what you\'re doing\r\nand pay attention to me."\r\n\r\nKendall raised his head and looked at the screen. The image that faced\r\nhim was that of a man; a tall man in ordinary street clothes, but\r\nwearing an odd silver mask over his face.\r\n\r\nKendall made no effort to hide his annoyance. This was no time for\r\njokes. Some lab comedian with time on his hands. "Now listen here! I\'m\r\nbusy and I\'m in no mood to--"\r\n\r\n"Shut up!"\r\n\r\nThe tone was sharp, brutal, contemptuous. It stiffened Kendall, then\r\neased him slowly back into his chair. "What do you want?

=== Chunk 4 ===
"\r\n\r\n"That\'s better."\r\n\r\n"Take that absurd mask off."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll leave it on."\r\n\r\n"Then get this over with. Tell me what you want!"\r\n\r\n"It will take a few minutes. Go over and lock your door."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll do no such thing!"\r\n\r\n"I said--_go over and lock your door_."\r\n\r\nTheir eyes clashed; Kendall\'s frank, indignant, accusing; the\r\nstranger\'s dark and menacing in the holes of the mask.\r\n\r\n"Very well." Kendall crossed the room and stood for a moment with his\r\nback to the phonovision screen. This man meant business. But what could\r\nbe the nature of that business? Kendall\'s thoughts went of course to\r\nthe top secret material he had access to. The defense of the world lay\r\nwithin the boundaries of the Canadian Flats Ordnance Research Project.\r\nBut safely so.\r\n\r\nThe Centaurians were as eager to set these secrets as--well, as had\r\nbeen the Russians during the first phase of the atomic era when the\r\nworld was divided into two frightened and belligerent camps. Strange,\r\nKendall thought, that he should think of that period. The world had\r\nlong since become one frightened and belligerent camp but the problem\r\nof survival had greatened as advanced science had opened the starways.\r\n\r\n"I said--lock the door!"\r\n\r\nKendall complied. As he returned to his desk, he sensed the man was\r\nsmiling behind his mask. What was he? A Centaurian? Either that or a\r\nTerran. Certainly not a Venusian unless he was standing on a box.\r\n\r\n"Sit down."\r\n\r\n"All right. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Let\'s get on with it."\r\n\r\n"In my own good time. First, let me sympathize with you on your love\r\nfor your wife."\r\n\r\n"What sort of idiocy are you talking about?"\r\n\r\nThe man ignored the question. "You are unique in that love, Mr.\r\nKendall. We conducted a telepathic survey of every married scientist in\r\nthis project. And only one psych-pattern was suited to our purpose."\r\n\r\nKendall scowled. "I think you are enjoying this--but I\'m not. And\r\nbelieve me, you\'ll live to regret it."\r\n\r\n"We were fortunate in finding you, Mr. Kendall--the one man here who\r\nwould be incapable of allowing his wife to die horribly if he could\r\nprevent it--no matter what the cost."\r\n\r\nA vague fear coupled with a chill was seeping through Kendall\'s brain.\r\n"Say what you\'ve come to say and get it over with!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m doing just that. We have your wife, Kendall. We got her at ten\r\no\'clock this morning."\r\n\r\n"Impossible! Our security is foolproof. No person has ever been\r\nkidnapped from any world defense project!"\r\n\r\n"Never before, but let me tell you why. Because such a hostage would\r\nhave been of little value. Terran scientists and defense personnel have\r\nbeen psychologically conditioned to the point of fanaticism. We have\r\nnever before discovered a Terran scientist who would put his wife or\r\nany other loved one before his loyalty to Terra."\r\n\r\n"And what makes you think I will?"\r\n\r\n"Our tests are absolute. But if we are wrong it will be unfortunate for\r\nonly one person. Your wife."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKendall thought of Clare, trying the while to keep his panic from\r\nshowing through. Blonde, beautiful Clare--the one person who really\r\nmade his life worth living. Clare. As he worked at this brutal, tedious\r\ndefense business, he did not work for the defense of Terra, though that\r\nidea and its psychological drive was ever in his conscious mind. He\r\nworked to keep Clare safe and now he realized the stark fact; realized\r\nit as he cursed the Centaurians and their devilish extrasensory\r\npenetration; cursed this masked devil for being right.\r\n\r\nShocked out of wariness, he allowed these thoughts to spill through his\r\nconscious mind; then he caught himself and threw up the blank mental\r\nwall all defense people were taught to use.\r\n\r\nBut not until the man chuckled behind his mask and said, "I agree on\r\nall counts, but you have to admit that we clocked you perfectly, Mr.\r\nKendall. The risk we took in kidnapping your wife was well worthwhile.

=== Chunk 6 ===
"\r\n\r\n"On the contrary. One life is of little consequence."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry you feel that way," the man said with mocking lightness in\r\nhis voice. "Let me describe the manner in which your wife will die.\r\nFirst we\'ll strip her nak--"\r\n\r\n"What is it you\'re after?" Kendall snapped.\r\n\r\nThe man\'s chuckle was even more pronounced. "You\'re right of course in\r\nsurmising I\'m a Centaurian, and you\'re quite familiar with the way our\r\ncold war works--how the balance of power has been maintained these last\r\nhundred years."\r\n\r\n"The balance is tipped in our favor."\r\n\r\n"Of course, but we now intend--through you--to remedy that\r\nsituation. You people are very ingenious in that you invent a total\r\ndestruction-type weapon and then turn right around and conceive an\r\nabsolute defense against it. We do the same, of course, or try to, but\r\nwe find ourselves at all times slightly behind you. A sad situation for\r\nwe Centaurians, don\'t you think, Mr. Kendall?"\r\n\r\n"Your chances of ever balancing us are remote."\r\n\r\n"Not so. Let me explain. Our great hope lies in obtaining the plans of\r\nyour latest projectile. I think you call it _Willy Seven_."\r\n\r\n"I know of no such plans." _Clare, lying defenseless against the\r\nobscene tortures of these soulless animals...._\r\n\r\n"Let\'s not waste time with lies, Mr. Kendall. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
You have been working on\r\nthe project."\r\n\r\n"The defense against _Willy Seven_--"\r\n\r\n"--Is not perfected!" The Centaurian leaned forward and snapped out\r\nthe words in triumph. "It can\'t possibly be ready for use in less than\r\nsix months because the projectile involved a difficult combination of\r\nlethal--germs and subsonic vibrations. The toughest you ever tackled."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA deep sickness clawed at Kendall\'s stomach. The Centaurian had hit\r\nupon the truth while still evidently unaware of Terran defense\r\nprocedure. He did not seem to know that the development of an offensive\r\nweapon was never allowed to proceed faster than the development of\r\na defense against it, the theory being two-fold; that defense was\r\nthe most important element concerned and that defense against our\r\nown weapons would probably function as safeguards against those of\r\nCentaurian origination.\r\n\r\nAlso, the possibility of theft had been foreseen. To have the plans of\r\na nondefensible weapon stolen would mark the end of Terra. But in the\r\ncase of _Willy Seven_, the defensive unit had involved such problems\r\nthat the defensive half of the project had lagged.\r\n\r\n... _They will give her drugs to sensitize the flesh and nerves of her\r\nbody until her sufferings will be those of ten people crowded into one\r\nskin...._\r\n\r\n"We want _Willy Seven_, Mr. Kendall. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
We want it now."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t have access to the plans."\r\n\r\nThe eyes were again baleful behind the mask. "Let\'s not waste time.\r\nYou know very well we didn\'t launch this project only to leave such\r\nimportant angles to chance."\r\n\r\n"But getting them out--"\r\n\r\n"You will take microfilms of the plans within the next twenty-four\r\nhours. We left a thumbnail-sized camera under your wife\'s pillow in\r\ncase you have need of it."\r\n\r\n"You thought of everything, didn\'t you?" Kendall said. "Everything\r\nexcept the one all-important point."\r\n\r\n"What is that?"\r\n\r\n"My wife could never be returned to me because there would be no place\r\nto return her--after you destroy this globe."\r\n\r\n"We are not fools. That phase of it has been well-planned. You will\r\napply for a three-day vacation and meet our ship at a location in\r\nYellowstone National Park. Your wife is already on her way to our\r\nplanet. You will follow her in a second ship--you and the plans. After\r\nthe annihilation of your world is accomplished, you will not find us\r\nungrateful. You will both be sent to Venus to live out the rest of your\r\nlives in ease."\r\n\r\n"I have only your word for that."\r\n\r\n"It is enough."\r\n\r\nAnd Kendall knew of course, that it was. The Centaurians would keep\r\ntheir word, mainly because breaking it after they had obtained their\r\nobjective would gain them nothing. They would keep their word because\r\ntheir propaganda department would insist.\r\n\r\n"And now," the Centaurian said, "I have stayed on this circuit long\r\nenough. Soon it will cause suspicion. A note will be delivered to you\r\ngiving the time and place of our meeting in Yellowstone."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKendall finished out his hours. And this was not strange. No need to\r\ngo out hunting Clare. A waste of energy to rush home looking for her.\r\nShe would not be home. She was on her way to a far-distant and hostile\r\nplanet where--unless he followed orders--she would scream out her life\r\nin agony unbearable to even contemplate.\r\n\r\nThe Centaurian was right. Kendall had not the iron will to allow this\r\neven though a dozen planets were on the block. He worked like a man\r\nin a dream and then drove slowly from Plant Nine along ten miles of\r\nwinding road to the residential section reserved for scientists.\r\n\r\nThe house was dark. He went through the back door and stood alone in\r\nthe kitchen. The dishes had been done. The place was spick and span. He\r\nknew the other rooms would be the same; beds made, floors swept. But\r\nClare was gone.\r\n\r\nNumbly, he wondered how they had accomplished it. He could have found\r\nout; checked at the gate and probably discovered by what ruse they had\r\nlured Clare out. No doubt forgery was involved; cleverly faked phone\r\ncalls perhaps; even accomplished actors masquerading as guards or\r\nofficials.\r\n\r\nBut it didn\'t matter really. Not now. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
Finding out would only satisfy\r\ncuriosity. No end would be served.\r\n\r\nKendall went into the living room and sat down in the dark and lit a\r\ncigarette. Two hours later, the tray beside him was filled with butts\r\nand his decision had been made.\r\n\r\nThey would get their prints. Clare must not suffer. He got up and went\r\ninto the bedroom and found the tiny camera under Clare\'s pillow....\r\n\r\nHe filled out a requisition the next morning and took it to his Section\r\nChief, the kindly gray-haired senior scientist who was responsible\r\nfor the work of twenty-five juniors. He read the requisition and his\r\neyes widened a trifle. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
"Hmmm. The stats on the _Willy Seven_ basic\r\nequations? I thought you were working on _Nike Twelve_, Kendall."\r\n\r\n"I am sir. But I\'ve got a hunch the _Willy_ coordinates might get me\r\nover a nasty little hump. There _is_ a similarity.

=== Chunk 11 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you\'re right." The Chief signed the permit without further\r\nobjection.\r\n\r\nThere was a numbed sickness in Kendall as he rode the elevator down to\r\nthe file vaults and showed his permit to three sets of guards before\r\nhe was admitted. Alone in the long, narrow aisles where the greatest\r\nsecrets of Terran defense and offense were housed, he walked like a man\r\nin a dream to the file he wanted and swiftly took his pictures. Then\r\nplacing the tiny camera into the cuff of his trousers, he went back to\r\nPlant Nine....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe three-day leave was granted without question, Kendall having over\r\ntwo months due him. The Chief was delighted that he did not ask for\r\nmore. "Where do you plan on going, Kendall?"\r\n\r\n"Out in the air somewhere. The Yellowstone, maybe. Some quiet place to\r\nclear my mind."\r\n\r\n"A good idea. Wife going with you?"\r\n\r\n"As a matter of fact, she went on ahead."\r\n\r\nKendall watched the Chief closely for reaction. Only a slight raising\r\nof eyebrows. After all, Clare could have gotten a permit without the\r\nChief\'s knowledge even if Kendall\'s story had been true.\r\n\r\n"Have a good time and come back full of enthusiasm."\r\n\r\nKendall replied in kind and went home and sat down facing the\r\nphonovision screen. It remained blank for three hours. Kendall did not\r\nmove. He smoked cigarettes and waited. Finally the signal sounded and\r\nhe snapped it on.\r\n\r\nThe man in the mask. The voice that now associated itself in Kendall\'s\r\nmind with nausea. "You have the film?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Excellent. The leave?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"You will leave the project immediately and--"\r\n\r\n"Not so fast."\r\n\r\n"I beg pardon?"\r\n\r\n"I said, not so fast. I\'m not satisfied with the arrangements."\r\n\r\nThe voice turned cold. "The arrangements are not yours to question.\r\nYou--"\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless, I question them. In fact, I demand some changes."\r\n\r\nThe man was obviously angry, but he held his temper. "What changes do\r\nyou wish?"\r\n\r\n"You said that after I deliver the prints on Centaur--"\r\n\r\n"And iron out any problems our scientists might encounter in building\r\nthe rocket--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, after that, you will send my wife and I to Venus and safety."\r\n\r\n"Correct."\r\n\r\n"I demand that upon delivery of the prints, you send Clare on ahead."\r\n\r\n"Why do you ask this?"\r\n\r\n"Because the one thing I\'m selling out my world for is her safety. I\r\nwill gamble with it for only as short a time as necessary."\r\n\r\nThe man considered. What were the risks involved? Kendall might be\r\nsincere in his reason but if he were not, it would be easy enough to\r\npick up Clare Kendall, unprotected as she would be in some Venusian\r\nhotel.\r\n\r\n"Granted," he said. Better to give in than to argue. Centaurian\r\nscientists could spot a major hoax on Kendall\'s part instantly, and\r\nKendall was under great pressure. Resist at this moment and he might\r\ndefy them, even with his wife\'s life at stake.\r\n\r\n"You will proceed at once to Yellowstone." He gave Kendall careful\r\ninstructions concerning the rendezvous and cut the connection.\r\n\r\nKendall sat for a long time staring at the blank screen--smoking\r\nendless cigarettes. After a while, he got wearily to his feet and\r\nlooked at his watch. In seven hours and twenty-five minutes he would\r\nbe on a Centaurian ship that would lift out of Terra\'s orbit and start\r\nbending space into time until....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe pale, green globe of Centaur hung in a black sky; greatened and\r\ndarkened and Kendall was looking out across the huge rocket port from\r\nwhich the Centaurians planned to launch Terra\'s destruction.\r\n\r\nNow, for the first time, he saw the Centaurian without the mask. The\r\nman was handsome. He had the cruel black eyes of all Centaurians. He\r\nsmiled coldly. "We\'ve come a long way, Kendall. I suppose you want to\r\nsee your wife."\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\nThat was a surprise. "I don\'t quite understand. Your feeling for her\r\nis--"\r\n\r\n"Such that I wouldn\'t dare allow myself close to her or I wouldn\'t have\r\nthe courage to let her go again."\r\n\r\n"It\'s unnecessary that you do. We Centaurians keep our bargains."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve made my decision."\r\n\r\nKendall did watch Clare as they took her from the building to the\r\nVenus-bound rocket. His heart lifted at sight of her slim beauty, at\r\nthe proud manner in which she carried herself, at the disdainful tilt\r\nof her head. Then she disappeared inside the rocket and he was again\r\nbleak and lonely.\r\n\r\nHe put himself at the disposal of the Centaurian scientists and\r\ndiscovered why Terra had stayed ahead for a century in the cold war.\r\nThey were able, but stolid and methodical. They did not possess the\r\nunfettered imaginative force that made Terran scientists supreme.\r\n\r\nDay by day the great lethal monster took form and Kendall\'s dread\r\nincreased as the time of completion approached. Then the momentous\r\nmorning arrived. Aside from asking technical questions and seeking\r\nguidance, the Centaurians left Kendall strictly alone; treated him with\r\ncontempt all traitors are accorded even from those they help. Kendall\r\ndid not seem to mind. In fact he preferred being alone.\r\n\r\nThen one morning the Centaurian approached him. "The launching is\r\ntoday. Would you like to witness the death stroke? The gesture with\r\nwhich we slay your planet?"\r\n\r\nKendall shrugged. 

=== Chunk 12 ===
"It makes little difference."\r\n\r\n"We will watch together from the tower...."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwo junior scientists in Plant Nine were discussing Kendall\'s\r\ndisappearance. "His leave was on the level. Signed by the Chief. Three\r\ndays."\r\n\r\n"Did he actually go to Yellowstone?"\r\n\r\n"They\'re pretty sure he did. After that he vanished into thin air."\r\n\r\n"Nobody vanishes into thin air." The junior scientist looked around and\r\nlowered his voice. "Do you think he defected?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. But I got the story pretty straight--that is, as much as\r\nthe high brass knows."\r\n\r\n"You did?"\r\n\r\n"The day before he left, Kendall went to the file vaults to check the\r\nprints on _Willy Seven_."\r\n\r\n"No!"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Then the thing\'s pretty cut and dried. If he smuggled those prints\r\nout--" The young scientist was puzzled. "I don\'t understand."\r\n\r\n"That\'s the strange part of it. Kendall didn\'t open that file. The\r\ntime-stamp mechanism recorded no entry as of that date."\r\n\r\n"Then what file did he open?"\r\n\r\n"They can\'t be sure, but the Crackpot File _was_ opened on that date."\r\n\r\n"The Crackpot File! But no one is allowed in there! All those crazy\r\ndangerous ideas!

=== Chunk 13 ===
"\r\n\r\n"I know. And one set of prints appeared to have been disturbed."\r\n\r\n"Photographed?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps. The rocket they labelled _Suicide One_. Professor Utterback\'s\r\nbrain child. The one they figured could never be launched.

=== Chunk 14 ===
"\r\n\r\n"I remember. The brass were pretty sure it would blow half the North\r\nAmerican continent away thirty seconds after the primer was ignited."\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"They think Kendall photographed those prints?"\r\n\r\n"They can\'t be sure, but with Centaur suddenly flaring into nova last\r\nweek--"\r\n\r\n"But that was pure coincidence. It had to be. If Kendall had a plan\r\nto get that rocket into the Centaurians\' hands, why did he keep it to\r\nhimself. It would have been the making of the man! 

=== Chunk 15 ===
He would have been a\r\nhero."\r\n\r\n"As I say, they have little to go on. Right now, they\'re trying to\r\nlocate Kendall\'s wife. If they find her they might learn something."\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
