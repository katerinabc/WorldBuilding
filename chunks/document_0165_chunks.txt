A nightmare in which all of Earth stood\r\nhelpless, unable to resist or flee, while the obscene shapes slithered\r\nand flopped over all her green fields and fair cities. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
And the awakening\r\nhad not brought the reassurance that it had all been a bad dream. That\r\nif it had happened in reality, the people of Earth would have been\r\ncapable of dealing with the terrible menace. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
It had been real. And they\r\nhad been no more capable of resisting the giant intelligences than a\r\nchild of killing the ogre in his favorite fairy story.\r\n\r\nIt was an ironic parallel, because that was what finally saved Earth for\r\nits own people. A fairy story.\r\n\r\nThe old fable of the lion and the mouse. When the lion had exhausted his\r\natomic armor and proud science against the invincible and immortal\r\ninvaders of Earth--for they could not be killed by any means--the mouse\r\nattacked and vanquished them.\r\n\r\nThe mouse, the lowest form of life: the fungoids, the air of Earth\r\nswarming with millions of their spores, attacked the monstrous bodies,\r\ngrew and entwined within the gray convolutions that were their brain\r\ncenters. And as the tiny thread-roots probed and tightened, the aliens\r\nscreamed soundlessly. The intelligences toppled and fell, and at last\r\nthat few among them who retained sanity gathered their lunatic brethren\r\nand fled as they had come.\r\n\r\nIf he had known the effect the fungoids would have on them, he would\r\nhave told them that too. He had told them everything else, when he had\r\nbeen snatched from a busy city street, a random specimen of humanity to\r\nbe probed and investigated.\r\n\r\nThey had chosen well. For the payment they offered him he was willing to\r\nbarter the whole human race. As far as it lay in his power he did just\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nHe was not an educated man, though he was intelligent. It was child\'s\r\nplay to them to strip his mind bare; but they had to know the\r\nintangibles too, the determined will of humanity to survive, the\r\nprobabilities of the pattern of human behavior in a situation which\r\nhumanity had never before faced. He told them all he could, gladly and\r\nwillingly. He would have descended to any treachery for the vast\r\nglittering reward they tempted him with.\r\n\r\nIt wasn\'t easy for the Yugoslavs to guard him and, anyway, their hearts\r\nweren\'t in the task. His treachery, the ultimate treason, the betrayal\r\nof the whole human race, was commonly known.\r\n\r\nInevitably the mob got him and killed three policemen in the process.\r\nWhen they had sated their anger a little and the traitor had lost most\r\nof his clothes and the thumb of his right hand, they dragged him to the\r\njunction where the Danube meets the Sava and held him under the gray\r\nwaters with long poles, as if he was some poisonous reptile.\r\n\r\nHe lay supinely on the bed of the river and smiled evilly while a\r\nhundred thousand people writhed in neural agony.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwenty-four hours later the neural plague had spread to Zagreb and into\r\nAlbania as far as Tirana. When it crossed to Leghorn in Italy the\r\nBalkans held twenty million lunatics and the Danube was an artificial\r\nlake a hundred miles wide.\r\n\r\nThey had used a "clean" bomb. So they were able to bring a loudspeaker\r\nvan to its edge and boom at him to come out. He allowed them to do that\r\nfor some inscrutable reason; perhaps to demonstrate that his powers were\r\nselective. Then it seemed he got tired of the farce, and cruel fingers\r\ntwined themselves into the nerve centers of the President of Italy and\r\nthe Prime Minister of the government of United Europe. He made them\r\ndance a horribly twisted _pas de deux_ on the banks of the Danube for\r\nhis perverted amusement.\r\n\r\nThen he released them, and released the millions of gibbering, twitching\r\nidiots that inhabited Southern Europe, and he came out of the river bed\r\nin which he had lain for forty-eight hours.\r\n\r\nHe walked alone through the deserted streets of Belgrade until he came\r\nto the United Nations building. There he told a very brave lieutenant\r\nthat he was willing to stand trial any place in the world they wished.\r\n\r\nFor three days nobody came to arrest him. He sat alone with the\r\nlieutenant in the peopleless city of Belgrade and waited for his\r\ncaptors. They came then, timidly reassured by his non-violence. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
While he\r\ntalked to them pleasantly the citizens of London and Paris suddenly\r\nbegan to dance jerky and grotesque jigs on the pavements of their\r\ncities. In the same moment the Chief Justice of the Court of the\r\nNations, at a cocktail party in Washington, writhed in the exquisite\r\npain of total muscle cramp, his august features twisted into a mask of\r\nabject fear.\r\n\r\nThe trial itself was a legal farce. The prisoner promptly pleaded guilty\r\nto the charge of betraying mankind to an alien race, but he didn\'t allow\r\nthem to question him. When one lawyer persisted in face of his pleasant\r\nrefusals, he died suddenly in a cramped ball of screaming agony.\r\n\r\nThe gray-faced Chief Justice inquired whether he wished to be sentenced\r\nand he answered yes, but not to death. They couldn\'t kill him, he\r\nexplained. That was part of the reward the aliens had given him. The\r\nother part was that _he_ could kill or immobilize anybody in the\r\nworld--or everybody--from any distance. He sat back and smiled at the\r\nstricken courtroom. Then he lost his composure and his mouth twitched.\r\nHe laughed uproariously and slapped his knees in ecstasy.\r\n\r\nIt was plain that he was fond of a joke.\r\n\r\nAn anonymous lawyer stood up and waited patiently for his merriment to\r\nsubside.\r\n\r\nIf this was true, he asked, why had not the aliens used this power? Why\r\nhad they not simply killed off the inhabitants and taken over the vacant\r\nplanet? 

=== Chunk 5 ===
The traitor gazed kindly at him; and a court stenographer who\r\nhad cautiously picked up a pencil returned agonizingly to her foetal\r\nposition and, that way, died.\r\n\r\nThe traitor looked at his fingers and shrugged. The thumb that had been\r\nsnapped off in the mob\'s frenzy was more than half grown again.\r\n\r\n"They needed slaves," he said simply.\r\n\r\n"And at the end, while some of them were still sane?"\r\n\r\nThe traitor raised his eyebrows, giving him his full courteous\r\nattention. The lawyer sat down abruptly, his question unfinished. The\r\ncreature who had betrayed his own race smiled at him and permitted him\r\nto live.\r\n\r\nHe even completed his question for him, and answered it. "Why did they\r\nnot kill then? They had something else on their minds--fungoids!" He\r\nlaughed uproariously at his macabre joke. "And in their minds too!"\r\n\r\nThe lawyer\'s blue eyes gazed at him steadily and he stopped laughing. In\r\nthe bated hush of the courtroom he said softly, "What a pity I\'m not an\r\nalien too. You could have the fungoids destroy me!"\r\n\r\nHe laughed again helplessly, the tears running down his cheeks.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Chief Justice adjourned the Court then and the prisoner sauntered to\r\nhis comfortable quarters in front of his frightened guards.\r\n\r\nThat night, in his own living room, the Chief Justice danced an agonized\r\nfandango in front of his horror-stricken wife and the anonymous lawyer\r\nsat in his apartment, staring at the blank wall. He was glad the aliens\r\nhad not made the traitor telepathic too.\r\n\r\nHe had found the chink in his armor.\r\n\r\nThe neural paralysis, the murders by remote control, were acts of a\r\nconscious will. He had himself admitted that if his mind was destroyed\r\nhis powers would be destroyed with it. The aliens had not sought revenge\r\nbecause their minds were totally occupied with saving themselves. The\r\nstricken ones had simply lost the power.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge was useless to him. There was no way they could attack his\r\nmind without his knowing it.\r\n\r\nPossibly they could steal away his consciousness by drugging or\r\nbludgeoning, but it would be racial suicide to attempt it. In the split\r\nmoment of realization he would kill every human being on Earth. There\r\nwould be nobody left to operate on his brain, to make him a mindless,\r\npowerless idiot for the rest of time. For any period of time, he\r\ncorrected himself. His brain would heal again.\r\n\r\nIt was useless to think about it. There was nothing they could use\r\nagainst his invincibility. The only hope was to attack him unawares ...\r\nand if that hope was a fraction less than a certainty it could only mean\r\nfinal and absolute catastrophe.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer looked at his watch. It was four in the morning.\r\n\r\nHe went into the kitchenette and then shrugged himself into his coat. He\r\nwalked through the silent streets, past the city hospital where the\r\nChief Justice lay in agony while the motor impulses from his nerve\r\ncenters wrenched and twisted his body. He entered the foyer of the\r\nluxury hotel where the race betrayer was held prisoner and took the\r\nelevator to the sixth floor.\r\n\r\nTwo sleepy guards jerked erect outside the unlocked door. He put his\r\nfinger to his lips, enjoining them to silence. Then he entered the room\r\nand stood for a moment over the man who was invincible and immortal--and\r\nhuman. Human, and subject to the involuntary unconsciousness which\r\nnature demands from all men. He slept.\r\n\r\nThe eyelids fluttered. The lawyer took the steel meat skewer from his\r\npocket. He thrust it through a half-opened eye and rotated it,\r\nmethodically reducing the soft brain to formless mush.\r\n\r\nAfter that the trial proceeded normally.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner stared vacantly in front of him and all his movements had\r\nto be directed. But he was alive and his thumb was full grown again.\r\n\r\nIt was the lawyer that noticed this and pointed out the implications.\r\nThe thumb had grown to full size in less than six weeks. They must\r\nregard that as their maximum period of immunity.\r\n\r\nThey ruminated over it for another four days. The question was a tricky\r\none, for malignant immortality was beyond human solution. It was not\r\njust a matter of dealing out punishment. The problem now was the\r\nprotection of the race from sudden annihilation. An insolvable problem,\r\nbut one that must be solved. They could only do their best.\r\n\r\nHe was sentenced to life imprisonment, with a special feature.\r\n\r\nIt was decided he should be guillotined once a month as long as he\r\nlived.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
