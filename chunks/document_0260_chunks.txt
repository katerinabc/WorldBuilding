My brother told\r\nme that, for one, back in the Sunset Country. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
But then, my brother is\r\nlame and good for nothing but drawing pictures of the stars. He connects\r\nthem with lines, like a child\'s puzzle, and so makes star-pictures. He\r\nhas fish stars, archer stars, hunter stars. That, I would say, is what\r\nis foolish.\r\n\r\nPerhaps that is what started it all. I was looking at the stars, trying\r\nto see the pictures, when I should have been minding my sentry post.\r\nThey took me like a baby, like a tot not yet given to the wearing of\r\nclothing. The hand came out of the darkness and clamped over my mouth,\r\nand I ceased my struggling when I felt a sharp blade pricking at the\r\nsmall of my back.\r\n\r\nAt first I feared that they would slay the entire camp as it slept and I\r\ncursed my brother for his star-pictures, cursed our leader who had sent\r\nus here, twenty archers, against the Onist outpost on our country\'s\r\nborder. But the Onists had other ideas. They took me away. I had to\r\nadmire their vitality, because all night we ran through the silent\r\nwoodlands, and they seemed tireless. I could maintain their pace, of\r\ncourse: but I\'m a Pluralist.\r\n\r\nI could see their village from a long way off, its night fires glowing\r\nin the dark. It was only then that we slowed our pace. Soon we entered\r\nthe place, a roughly circular area within a stockade, and my captors\r\nthrust me within a hut. I couldn\'t do much worrying about tomorrow, not\r\nwhen I was so tired. I slept.\r\n\r\nI dreamed a stupid dream about the Onist beliefs, the beliefs of an\r\nunimaginative people who could picture one Maker and one Maker only. I\r\nmust have chuckled in my sleep.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"You\'re awake."\r\n\r\nA brilliant statement, that--because I had sat up, squinted into the\r\nbright sunlight streaming in through the doorway, yawned and stretched.\r\nThe Onists, I tell you, lack imagination.\r\n\r\nThe girl who spoke was a pretty enough little thing for an Onist. She\r\nsmiled, showing even white teeth. "Do you Pluralists eat?"\r\n\r\nI nodded and rubbed my belly. I was to have had dinner after my turn as\r\nsentry the night before, and now I felt like I could do justice to my\r\nportion even at one of the orgies for which the Onists are so famous.\r\n\r\n"Bring on your food and I\'ll show you," I told her, and she turned her\r\nback to walk outside. It was early and the village seemed silent--surely\r\nthey hadn\'t intended this one slim maid to guard me! Yet she seemed\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nI leaped at her, circled her neck with my arm, prepared to make my exit.\r\nThey would laugh around our fire when I told them of this fine example\r\nof the Onist lack of foresight....\r\n\r\nExcept that the girl yelped. Not loudly, but it was loud enough, and a\r\nbig muscular Onist came striding in with his throwing spear. He backed\r\nme off into a corner, prodding my hungry belly with his weapon.\r\n\r\n"Will you behave?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI told him I would and he backed outside, but this time I could see his\r\nshadow across the doorway.\r\n\r\nThe girl brought food and partook of it with me. I was surprised,\r\nbecause we Pluralists will not eat with an Onist out of choice. Well, I\r\nhave said they are a strange people. Soon the girl stood up, patting her\r\nmouth daintily with a square of cloth, and in that, of course, she was\r\ntrying to mime our graceful Pluralist women. "I suppose you think we are\r\ngoing to kill you," she said. Just like that.\r\n\r\n"To tell you the truth, I haven\'t given it much thought. There isn\'t\r\nmuch I can do about it."\r\n\r\n"Well, we\'re not. We could have done that back at your camp. We could\r\nhave killed all of you. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
No, we want to show you something."\r\n\r\nI had a ridiculous thought that they made star-pictures, too--even those\r\nwho are not lame like my brother. I said, "Well, what will happen to me\r\nafter you show me?"\r\n\r\nShe smiled. "You still think we\'re going to kill you. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
What\'s your name?"\r\n\r\nI told her, but I thought: she can\'t even keep a conversation going\r\nwithout changing the subject.\r\n\r\n"Jak," she repeated after me. "That\'s a common enough name. We have Jaks\r\namong our Onist people, you know."\r\n\r\n"No, I didn\'t. But you probably copied it."\r\n\r\n"I doubt that. We were here first, Jak. Our records say so. Probably,\r\nyou once captured a man with that name, long ago, liked it, and took it\r\nfor your people."\r\n\r\n"_You_ were here first!" I sneered. "Maybe that\'s what your records tell\r\nyou, but it isn\'t so. Look: the Makers endowed us with life, then went\r\naway in to the sky. By mistake they left one idiot-Maker behind, and he\r\nhad nothing to do. He made you Onists before he perished, and that is\r\nwhy you think there is only one Maker."\r\n\r\nShe seemed highly insulted. "Idiot-Maker? 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Idiot! There was only one\r\nMaker, ever, but because your minds cannot conceive of all that glory\r\nresiding in one figure, you invented a score."\r\n\r\nNow it was my turn to be indignant. "A score? Hundreds, you mean;\r\nthousands--more than there are leaves on the trees."\r\n\r\n"Well, I won\'t argue with you. Our war has been arguing that point well\r\nenough." I was sorry she would not argue. She looked very pretty when\r\nshe argued, her breasts heaving, her eyes sparkling fire.\r\n\r\n"What\'s your name?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Nari. My name is Nari. And don\'t tell me you had that name first!"\r\n\r\nI smiled blandly. "Of course we did. I have an aunt, my mother\'s sister,\r\nwho goes by that name. My brother\'s wife\'s cousin, also; but she is very\r\nugly."\r\n\r\n"And am I ugly?" Nari wanted to know. I guess in that sense at least,\r\nwomen are the same everywhere--Pluralist or Onist, it doesn\'t matter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI looked at her. I looked at her so hard that it made her blush, and\r\nthen she looked even prettier. But I didn\'t tell her so.\r\n\r\n"You will pass, for an Onist," I admitted. "I guess the Onists might\r\nconsider you pretty; the Onist men might stamp their feet and shout if\r\nyou go by--but then, they are Onists."\r\n\r\nAt that, she seemed on the verge of leaving my prison hut, but something\r\nmade her change her mind. She stayed all morning and on into the\r\nafternoon. We argued all the time, except at midday, when she went\r\noutside to get our lunch. She stumbled a little and fell half against my\r\nshoulder. I moved toward her to hold her up, and it was the most natural\r\nthing in the world to take her in my arms and kiss her. She must have\r\nthought so, too; she responded beautifully--for an Onist.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch, Nari did not mention the kiss, nor did I. It now seemed the\r\nmost natural thing in the world not to talk about it. We argued some\r\nmore, Nari defending her primitive beliefs, I trying to show her the\r\nlight of truth. But it was no use: the war had been fought and the war\r\nwould continue.\r\n\r\nLater that day we set out. That came as a surprise to me, because I had\r\ntaken it for granted that whatever the Onists wanted to show me was\r\nright here in this little village. A dozen of us went, and when we had\r\nbeen on the trail for some little time, Nari joined us, declaring that\r\nshe wanted to see it again--whatever it was.\r\n\r\nWe went for three days, and although these Onists turned out to be\r\nbetter woodsmen than I had thought, still, they could not match the\r\nskill we Pluralists have mastered over the generations. I believe I\r\ncould have escaped, had I wanted to; but I hardly seemed a prisoner of\r\nwar, and besides, once or twice when we had lagged to the rear of the\r\ncolumn, Nari stumbled against me like that day in the hut, and what\r\ncould I do but kiss her?\r\n\r\nIt was another village we reached at the end of our march, much bigger\r\nthan the first. Surprisingly, it looked a lot like a Pluralist town,\r\nalthough it may only have seemed so because I had been out in the\r\nwoodlands for three days. They took me straightways to the village\r\nsquare, and it was there that I saw the statue.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese statues of the Makers are rare, and I was surprised to see one in\r\nan Onist village. I got on my knees at once to do it reverence. I\r\nrealize it was impious to look up, but I did--I had to see if it were\r\nthe genuine thing. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
And it was, to the last detail. Constructed of the\r\nforbidden substance known as metal, it towered three times a Pluralist\'s\r\nheight, or three times an Onist\'s, for that matter. I have always\r\nwondered why the Makers did not create our ancestors in their own\r\nsubstance, as they had fashioned us in their image. But that is an\r\nimpious thought.\r\n\r\nA stern gray-haired Onist who said he was Nari\'s father took me aside\r\nafterwards. "Now, Jak," he asked me, "what can you say of what you have\r\nseen?

=== Chunk 7 ===
"\r\n\r\nI shrugged. "I can say that somehow you\'ve found one of the Maker\r\nstatues. What more?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s one, is it not?"\r\n\r\n"Of course it\'s one. They are rare, but I have seen three, all told, in\r\nPluralist villages."\r\n\r\n"And each time they were separate? You never saw a group?"\r\n\r\n"No. No, I didn\'t."\r\n\r\nHe slapped his hands together triumphantly. "Then that proves it. Each\r\nis a copy of the original Maker, but there was only one. Otherwise you\r\nwould have seen statues in groups. And that is why you are here, Jak: we\r\nwant you to go back to your people and tell them what you saw."\r\n\r\nI shook my head. "What you say isn\'t logical. So what if the statues are\r\nnever in pairs or groups? We\'ve only seen a few, when once there must\r\nhave been many. Also, when your artists do their magic with dyes and\r\ncreate portraits, are they generally done one at a time or in groups?"\r\n\r\n"One at a time, so the artist may capture the personality in each face,\r\nnaturally. I have seen group portraits, but I think they are silly\r\nthings."\r\n\r\n"Exactly." Now I was triumphant. "Exactly as the Makers thought, which\r\nis why the statues are always single--"\r\n\r\n"But it is impious to say there was more than one Maker! He had all the\r\nknowledge in the world at his fingertips, and so there was no need for\r\nmore than one. More than this world, even: he went to the stars. Or\r\ndon\'t you believe that?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I believe it. Only, _they_ went to the stars, the thousands\r\nof Makers. It isn\'t impious, because if you can think of one being as\r\ngreat as that, try to picture thousands. Yes, thousands. That makes me\r\nthousands of times more pious than you Onists.

=== Chunk 8 ===
"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head wearily. "What\'s the use? It is for this we are\r\nfighting our war, and we thought if we took one of you here, showed him\r\nthe undeniable truth of our statue.... Well, will you at least return to\r\nyour people with a tale of what you have seen?"\r\n\r\nI agreed readily enough: probably, the alternative was death. Although\r\nPluralists on rare occasions have been known to take Onist women as\r\ntheir wives, an Onist prisoner of war was an unwanted thing. The reverse\r\nwould also be true.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey all bid me goodbye, except for Nari. I could not find her anywhere\r\nin the village, and a little sadly I set out on my long journey back to\r\nthe Sunset Land. By now our raiding party had finished its work on the\r\nsmall Onist village on the rim of our country, and I could do nothing\r\nbut return to my people, where we might plan new strategy against the\r\nunbelievers.\r\n\r\nBut I had wanted to bid Nari farewell.\r\n\r\nI met her in the woodlands, a travel bag slung over her shoulder like a\r\nmale\'s. "I wanted to say goodbye privately," she told me.\r\n\r\n"Good," I said, but I knew she was lying. Else why the travel bag?\r\n\r\n"Goodbye," Nari whispered, but she was not looking at me. Looking,\r\ninstead, behind her, at the land of her people.\r\n\r\n"Nari," I told her, "I have to admit it. You are very pretty--even by\r\nPluralist standards. You are--"\r\n\r\nThis time she did not stumble against me. It wasn\'t necessary. I drew\r\nher to me, and I kissed her a long kiss. Then I told her I loved her,\r\nand women, I suppose, will always be women, because she said she knew\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI will take Nari back to our village in the Sunset Land, where we will\r\nbe married by the laws of my people. And if ever there is to be peace\r\nbetween the Pluralists and the Onists, it may, after all, come on these\r\ngrounds. The Onists have their beliefs, and so I hate them for their\r\nimpious thoughts. But the love of a man for a maid exists apart from\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nIt won\'t be easy. Our arguing continued all the way back to the Sunset\r\nLand, and Nari is as stubborn as I am firm.\r\n\r\n"There is one Maker," she said.\r\n\r\nAnd I told her, "No, there are many."\r\n\r\nOr later, as we neared the Sunset Land, we picked up the thread of our\r\nthoughts again. Pluralist or Onist, we androids are dogmatic creatures.\r\n\r\n"One Robot created us all before he went to the stars," said Nari.\r\n\r\n"Robots," I said. "Many Robots." But I kissed her.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _If Worlds of Science Fiction_ July\r\n    1952.
