=== Chunk 2 ===
]\r\n\r\n\r\nLieutenant Colonel Martin sat back in his hard desk chair and looked\r\nout through the tinted window to where the slim, dartlike jets waited,\r\npoised on the sun-washed runways. A red and blue jet swooped down out\r\nof the brilliant, cloudless sky and shot along the runway, wheeled and\r\nrolled back toward the parking strip. It was the courier ship from\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nThe colonel frowned, his sunburned face breaking into sharp, diagonal\r\nlines. The courier plane was used only in cases requiring utmost\r\nsecrecy. And always, it brought trouble. Today, it brought trouble for\r\nMartin.\r\n\r\nHe waited, tapping a lean finger on the desk, his eyes distant but not\r\nseeing the harsh ridge of up-flung barren mountains, looming clear and\r\nincredibly near despite the fact they were sixty miles away--sixty\r\nmiles of alkali wasteland where only gila monsters moved, scuttling\r\nfrom rock to rock to escape the brazen sun.\r\n\r\nBeyond those mountains was Project Breakaway, the Air Force\'s top\r\nsecret attempt to fling a dart up high enough and fast enough to\r\nbreak free of earth\'s clutching gravity. It was Colonel Martin\'s job\r\nto command one group of jets that guarded the approaches to Project\r\nBreakaway. It had been a dull job--routine, boring--up until yesterday\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nIt was twenty-eight hours ago, to be exact, that Colonel Martin,\r\nCaptains Morelli, Sayers and Ryan had sighted and chased the fantastic\r\nplatelike object that zoomed, wobbled and ducked in circles about\r\nthem even though, with all coal poured on, they were hitting close to\r\neight-hundred miles an hour.\r\n\r\nMorelli, Sayers and Ryan had never come back from that chase. At\r\neight-hundred miles an hour, with visibility limited only by the\r\nfarthermost rim of the horizon, under a glaring desert sun, all\r\nthree had plowed simultaneously into a sun-drenched ridge, a mere\r\nnine thousand feet above sea-level--a ridge, it appeared, they\'d\r\ndeliberately headed for and smashed into. How? Why had all three made\r\nthe same error of judgment? Why had they dropped from thirty-thousand\r\nfeet to nine thousand in a steep, zooming dive, flying formation, and\r\nnot once mentioned it over their radio?\r\n\r\nWhy indeed? These were all questions asked Colonel Martin by suspicious\r\nsecurity agents, Air Force Intelligence three-star generals, and, by\r\ndirect TV hookup, the Air Secretary himself.\r\n\r\nBut the sixty-four dollar question they asked was: why hadn\'t Colonel\r\nMartin smashed into that ridge too? Good question. Unfortunately, his\r\nanswer was so bad, it called for the services of a trained alienist.\r\nThey\'d flown one in. He\'d listened and asked for time. He was getting\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMartin swung and watched the occupants of the red and blue jet swing\r\ndown and stride quickly across the hot concrete.\r\n\r\nHe recognized one of the approaching men as Under-Secretary of\r\nAir, Saunders. The other was General Brereton, on the staff of G2.\r\nRegardless of whether or not they considered him insane, they felt that\r\nsomething had happened--something important enough to rate two next in\r\nrank to the top commanders.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey came in unescorted. He stood at attention until the burly general\r\nwaved a hand rather irritably, putting him at ease, then he sank down\r\nagain into his hard seat. Now it would start all over again. The\r\nquestions, the careful scrutinizing of the plates he\'d taken, the hard\r\nnarrowed eyes, the disbelief--\r\n\r\n"In your own words, again," the general was saying, "Will you repeat\r\nto Mr. Saunders what you told me over the TV hookup last night?" The\r\ngeneral leaned forward and fumbled with the pile of color photographs\r\non his desk. "Are these--the shots you took?"\r\n\r\nColonel Martin nodded wearily, sighed, looked briefly out the window\r\nand said in a soft even voice, "Captains Morelli, Ryan and Sayers and\r\nI took off at 0800--"\r\n\r\n"Who gave permission for the flight?" Saunders cut in crisply. "Is it\r\nroutine for your people to fly formations around here without some\r\nspecial alert?"\r\n\r\nMartin stiffened slightly. "No sir. It was an unauthorized flight. My\r\nidea." 

=== Chunk 3 ===
He moistened his lips. "We are on twenty-four hours alert, of\r\ncourse--"\r\n\r\n"A fat lot of good that would do if every group leader took off when he\r\nfelt like it," the general sputtered, impaling Martin with eyes like\r\nblue icicles.\r\n\r\n"We are allowed twelve hours a month flight time," Martin said. "I will\r\nadmit I didn\'t file a plan or report my intention to take the group\r\nup--but that, sirs, is important in view of what happened." 

=== Chunk 4 ===
He leaned\r\nforward. "I believe--I\'m certain, sirs, that we caught--_them_--off\r\nguard." He chewed his lips at the sudden veiled look in Saunders\' eyes.\r\nIt was plain they considered him mentally unhinged.\r\n\r\nThey waited, saying nothing, their faces as chill and immobile as\r\nmarble. Martin spread his big, raw-knuckled hands.\r\n\r\n"We took off. I flew lead, as usual," Martin began. "We were up to\r\nabout twenty thousand and climbing when I ordered an attack pattern. We\r\nwere doing about six hundred ground speed when Ryan, I believe it was,\r\nsuddenly shouted over the radio, that something had just made a pass\r\nat him. We all saw it at once, after that, a round platelike object,\r\nabout thirty inches in diameter, maybe ten inches thick and the color\r\nof buffed aluminum. It moved sort of jerkily, wobbling back and forth\r\nand occasionally dancing up and down--almost as though it were attached\r\nto a string or something.

=== Chunk 5 ===
"\r\n\r\nThe two listeners exchanged glances. It was obvious what they were\r\nthinking, but Martin went doggedly on.\r\n\r\n"I ordered the men to break formation but to remain at thirty thousand\r\nand keep it in sight. I put my ship on auto-pilot--I carry a camera\r\nand I wanted to get some shots. I did, about twelve color pix, aiming\r\ndirectly at the thing. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
I couldn\'t possibly have missed."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGeneral Brereton snorted and handed the developed prints to Saunders.\r\nSaunders examined each one, his brows lifting higher and higher.\r\nFinally he handed the pictures to the general and turned to Martin.\r\n\r\n"Those pictures are utterly blank," he said quietly. "They show nothing\r\nbut blue sky and a distant horizon. How do you account for that?"\r\n\r\n"I can only say," Martin replied, "that the camera doesn\'t lie. I\'ve\r\ntaken too many shots with that camera not to know that it\'s in top\r\ncondition. It couldn\'t--and didn\'t lie. _There was no flying disc in\r\nfront of us._"\r\n\r\n"No!" The general frowned and sat up with a jerk. "First you tell us\r\nthis story of an object darting and weaving about your formation--an\r\nobject four men see and give chase. An object that led three good\r\npilots to their death--and now you say there was no object!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s the only explanation I can give for the way in which Morelli,\r\nRyan and Sayers hit that peak," Martin said patiently. "As I say, my\r\nship was on auto-pilot. I was shooting away--and at all times, _that\r\ndisc was directly in front of me_." He stopped and looked at the two to\r\nsee if they caught the significance of what he\'d just told them. They\r\nhadn\'t.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you understand--the others kept up a running commentary, each\r\nsaying that the disc was directly in front of him--and all the time,\r\nunknown to me--they were in a steep dive and simultaneously, they hit\r\nthat peak at nine-thousand feet."\r\n\r\nThere was another long silence, broken only by muffled sounds from the\r\nfield outside--the chugging of fuel trucks, shouts of mechanics, the\r\noccasional crackling hum as a jet was fired up.\r\n\r\n"Then it is your contention," Saunders said, "That each of you was\r\nsuffering from a hallucination--a mirage, in fact. A mirage which took\r\nthe form of a flying disc and which caused three trained pilots to fail\r\nto notice that they were losing altitude and heading directly into a\r\nmountain peak. Is that what you\'re trying to say?"\r\n\r\n"It was not a mirage," Martin said. "It was a deliberately implanted\r\nimpression."\r\n\r\n"Explain yourself," the general said hoarsely. He exchanged a swift\r\nglance with Saunders.\r\n\r\n"The disc suddenly wasn\'t there--after the others had hit, I imagine. I\r\ndon\'t know for sure--but suddenly, the thing just sort of--turned off.\r\nIt wasn\'t there. I looked around and saw the pillar of smoke far off to\r\nmy left and rear but no following ships. I swung around and tried to\r\ncontact my men. No result. I went over the spot where the fires were\r\nand recognized them immediately as--the remains. I contacted the base.\r\nWhile I was hanging around up there, I had a lot of time to think. I\r\nrealized then what I\'ve already told you--that each of the men thought\r\nthe disc was directly before him. Each followed it--to his death. I\r\nwasn\'t operating manually--my auto-pilot--" he smiled strangely--"isn\'t\r\nsusceptible to--hypnotic suggestions--so it flew a straight course--at\r\nthirty-thousand."\r\n\r\n"You believe that you--and the others--were hypnotized into thinking\r\nyou were seeing a flying disc. Is that it?" the general said dryly.\r\n\r\n"I believe that we caught someone--some _thing_--off guard when we\r\ntook off on an unannounced flight," Martin said with firm conviction,\r\nignoring the sudden reaction they showed. "I\'m sure we were heading in\r\na direction where some secret lay--without sufficient advance warning\r\nfor whatever holds that secret to cover up. I\'m positive we were\r\nhypnotized--lured away just like a mother quail pulls the broken wing\r\nstunt to get a dog away from her nest."\r\n\r\n"Doesn\'t that explanation strike you as unbalanced, to say the least,"\r\nSaunders said slowly. "What person could possibly have such powers--or\r\ndevices, to hypnotize four men flying thirty-thousand feet above the\r\nearth at eight-hundred miles an hour?"\r\n\r\n"No power on earth," Martin said softly. "The Panamint Indians won\'t go\r\nnear those mountains." He gestured to the tinted window and beyond, to\r\nwhere the great range of jagged mountains gleamed luridly orange and\r\npurple under the slanting rays of the desert sun. "They have positive\r\nbeliefs--not legends--about beings from other worlds who dig in the\r\nhills for shining metals.... Who have great ships that fly. Beings\r\nwho can make a man who comes too near die of thirst even though he\r\ncarries water at his belt. Beings who can control the minds of men." He\r\nhesitated. "That\'s why they named those mountains--the Superstitions."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid you\'ll have to find a better explanation than that," the\r\ngeneral said stiffly.\r\n\r\n"You have the written reports of the radio men on duty," Martin\r\nsaid. "They all heard Ryan, Morelli and Sayers talking. They back\r\nup every word I\'ve said. You asked my opinion and I\'ve told you.\r\nSomeone--something, didn\'t want us snooping around when they weren\'t\r\nprepared for it--and they simply drew us away by means of delusion or\r\nmind control of some kind."\r\n\r\n"We\'ve photographed every inch of this entire corner of the state," the\r\ngeneral said. "You have stated that the camera doesn\'t lie. We have\r\nobserved nothing unusual in any of the many excellent photographs made\r\nof the area you flew over yesterday."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMartin smiled briefly. "You observed nothing because they were ready\r\nfor you. It wouldn\'t be much of a job for them to camouflage, if\r\nthey\'re prepared in advance. I imagine they intercept every message in\r\nand out of here."\r\n\r\n"You make it sound very plausible," the general said sourly. "But we\'re\r\nlooking for something besides words."\r\n\r\nMartin rose and his lean figure towered over them. "I held this out\r\nbecause I wanted you both to understand what line of reasoning made\r\nme go back. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
I sound insane because, of course, what I\'ve said isn\'t\r\npleasant for human minds to accept."\r\n\r\nHe brought out a large composite, constructed of carefully\r\njoined-together aerial photographs pasted on a board. "Yesterday, after\r\nI saw the smashed ships, and while I waited for the base to confirm, I\r\nwent back over the route I\'d taken while following the will-o-the-wisp\r\ndisc--on auto-pilot. This time, I shot downwards--at the earth." He\r\nslid the composite around so that it faced the two men. They came\r\nerect, eyes glittering, staring down at it.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t mention this over the TV hookup last night, or to any of the\r\ninterrogators for reasons already given. I wanted to make certain only\r\nthe highest echelon would see this." He handed the general a powerful\r\nmagnifying glass. "Those ships must be a good thousand feet long, don\'t\r\nyou think?" He laughed softly, a thin, triumphant sound that filled the\r\nroom. "Who\'d think that spiders--like those--could make such machines."\r\n\r\nSaunders and the general stared grimly at the fantastic shapes and\r\nobjects that were frozen in sharp clarity on the magnified photos.\r\nGreat round-domed buildings, connected with long, dully-gleaming\r\nwalks. And here and there tall needle-pointed ships rested on broad\r\nconcrete-like bases, their slender snouts pointed up towards the blue\r\nsky, while about their bases swarmed creatures that were squat and\r\nbroad and many-limbed.\r\n\r\nThe two men looked at him, then turned once again to their scrutiny of\r\nthe composite, their faces impassive, unchanging. Martin opened the\r\ndesk drawer and piled half a dozen thin negatives near the general\'s\r\nelbow.\r\n\r\n"Here are the negatives," he said. "You can see--they\'re genuine," he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"Genuine," Martin echoed. "And they grounded me because they thought I\r\nwas insane!" He flashed a white grin. "But I won\'t be grounded after\r\nthis--and neither will the rest of us, because not a hundred miles\r\naway, sirs, is the answer to everything--everything we\'ve ever wanted\r\nto know. Project Breakaway?" He laughed aloud again. "Kindergarten\r\nstuff to them!"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps they\'re not interested in teaching--kindergarten," Saunders\r\nsaid slowly. He gave Martin a piercing glance. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
"A most remarkable job,\r\nColonel. Lucid thinking. You\'re to be congratulated."\r\n\r\n"Thank you," Martin said. "I\'m glad it convinced you."\r\n\r\n"So much so," the general said, "That we\'ll have to leave with it\r\nimmediately." He stuffed the negatives and composite into a briefcase.\r\nThey shook hands, exchanged a few more congratulatory words, then\r\nstepped out the door. Beyond them, he saw the alienist, Major Elliston,\r\nat the end of the hall. They shut the door quietly and Martin stared at\r\nit, a faint crease between his eyes. He licked his lips, swallowed once\r\nor twice and drew a deep, shaky breath.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe door opened and the major came in. He looked curiously about the\r\nroom. "Had the radio on?" he asked. "An awful lot of conversation in\r\nhere, it seemed."\r\n\r\nMartin sank into the chair, looking over at the sparkling pitcher of\r\ncool water on the sidetable. "Funny you should ask that," he said\r\nvaguely. "Didn\'t you recognize--"\r\n\r\n"Better get ready for the big brass," the major interrupted. "And for\r\nGod\'s sake, if you insist on that story about being hypnotized, at\r\nleast make it a little more plausible than the one you told me--" He\r\nstopped and looked out the window. "Here they come now.

=== Chunk 9 ===
"\r\n\r\nMartin whirled and stared out the green-tinted window overlooking the\r\nrunway. A red and blue jet streaked along, wheels down, hit, bounced\r\nand braked to a stop. It wheeled about, flashing under the late sun,\r\nand rolled up to the parking strip.\r\n\r\n"Another courier ship!" Martin murmured. "But, I don\'t--"\r\n\r\n"Another--" the major looked curiously at him. "What do you mean,\r\n\'another courier ship\'? That\'s the only one today--and one\'s too many,\r\nif you ask me."\r\n\r\nDry tongue scraping over dry lips, Martin stared at him, then back to\r\nthe familiar red and blue jet. He swung and looked down the line of\r\nparked jets, straining to see the other red and blue which had landed\r\nover an hour ago. There was no red and blue jet there.\r\n\r\n"Here they come now," the major muttered. "Holy cow! Saunders,\r\nUnder-Secretary to the old man, no less. And General Brereton--G2." 

=== Chunk 10 ===
He\r\nturned to Martin. "Better give it to them straight--" He broke off,\r\nseeing Martin\'s burning eyes in his drawn gray face, hearing the sudden\r\nstrange rattling breath as he pawed weakly through the empty desk\r\ndrawer.\r\n\r\n"Negatives. Composite," Martin croaked. "Gone. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
_They_ took them, and I\r\nnever guessed!" His hands trailed limply and he fell across the desk,\r\nbounced and rolled onto the floor.\r\n\r\nWith a single bound the major was at his side.\r\n\r\n"Good God! It\'s unbelievable!" he gasped.\r\n\r\nHe stared in horror at the dry lips, the swollen black tongue. In the\r\nspace of seconds the hard young man was a limp scarecrow whose lips\r\ncracked and moved in a dry-as-dust whisper. The major bent his ear\r\nclose to the withered mouth, listening.\r\n\r\n"Water." The words were faint in his ear. "For heaven\'s sake--water."\r\n\r\nThe major reached up and lifted the big pitcher of cool water off the\r\nsidetable. "Here, colonel, drink. Here\'s all the water you could want."\r\n\r\nBut already, it was too late.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
