Now he stood in the Control\r\nCenter, in the mid-section of the revolving wagon-wheel ship, looking\r\nat Oakey Matthews.\r\n\r\nThere had been times aboard this ship when a whole crew had been\r\ncomfortable in months-long trips through space. But now there were\r\nonly three men, three men fleeing from death and it was no longer\r\ncomfortable here, because death was breathing down the neck of at least\r\none of them.\r\n\r\nOakey was intent on the instruments in front of him. Oakey was young,\r\nwith a face that glowed with velvet skin. Even in space Oakey shaved\r\nevery day, shined his shoes and pressed his uniform. Al was sloppy,\r\nbearded and ungroomed. But Al had lived most of his 50 years in space.\r\n\r\nOakey looked up toward Al. His young eyes searched the hard leathery\r\nface of his commander. He saw the grim set to Al\'s jaw and the hard\r\nlines around the older man\'s eyes. Al was cold. Nerveless as a piece of\r\nrope.\r\n\r\n"How\'s Joe?" Oakey asked.\r\n\r\nAl shook his head. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
"Last stages," he said. The commander went to a\r\ntier of built-in drawers across the room from the control panel. His\r\narm reached out, pulled on the third drawer from the bottom. From this\r\ndrawer he took an old-fashioned revolver and a box of shells. Not\r\nordinary shells. The bullets were plastic, strong enough to pierce\r\nflesh, too soft to rupture the walls of the space ship.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t do it, Al," Oakey said, watching the commander.\r\n\r\nAl shook his head. He slipped bullets into the cylinder.\r\n\r\n"We\'re the last earthmen, let\'s not die killing each other," pleaded\r\nthe young man. "This thing will catch us all before long. Let\'s stop\r\nfighting it. Joe\'s our pal. Let him live."\r\n\r\n"We\'re the last earthmen and we\'re going down fighting," said Al.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve fought. For ten years we\'ve fought. Now we\'re in space, Al.\r\nSo far from the sun we can\'t tell it from any other star. There\'s no\r\nearth women here. Even if we live a few years longer, the strain of\r\nearth-blood dies with us. We\'re licked, Al. Let\'s surrender gracefully."\r\n\r\n"We\'re earthmen," said Al. "We fight."\r\n\r\n"The last earthmen. There\'s nothing left to fight for--"\r\n\r\n"Except life," said Al. "Now listen, Oakey. I\'m still commander. I\r\nknow what I\'m doing and you take orders from me--or it\'s mutiny. Yeah,\r\nI know the Quinnies have covered the earth. From the Arctic to the\r\ntropics men died shooting sparks like fireworks. But the earth isn\'t\r\nthe only planet in the Galaxy where men exist. You didn\'t take that\r\nfirst trip this ship made, did you, boy?"\r\n\r\nOakey laughed. "That was ten years ago. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
I was a kid in high school\r\nthen."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAl flipped the cylinder closed and made sure the gun was ready to use.\r\n"We went to another system," he said. "A fluke, maybe. Or maybe the Old\r\nMan planned it. He believed in interstellar travel by dimensional short\r\ncuts. I was third mate, like you. I fingered the controls and he gave\r\nme the figures. Something like a double right-angle repeated twice.\r\nI was dizzy as hell when I finally put old Wagon Wheel on a straight\r\ncourse, but after I blinked my eyes a couple of times and looked out\r\nthrough a porthole, I knew that the Old Man was right. There was the\r\ncutest little green planet, and the nicest, warmest fourth-magnitude\r\nsun you ever saw." He smiled and the hard lines disappeared for a\r\nmoment. "Where are we now?"\r\n\r\n"Sixty-three, seven, ninety-one. At 1300. I can work it down to twelve\r\ndecimals, sir, if you want--"\r\n\r\n"Never mind. Just watch the instruments. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
The chronometer lines will\r\ntell you when."\r\n\r\nAl stuffed the revolver under his belt in the front of his trousers.\r\n"We\'re going back to that planet, Oakey. A pretty little place, soft\r\nand warm as a tropical isle. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
And there were nice looking people\r\nthere--human beings like us." Al closed his eyes. "Such women. Nice\r\nround shoulders. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Soft brown eyes you could spend a lifetime looking\r\ninto. There was one...."\r\n\r\nAl paused while his fingers seemed to caress the butt of the pistol.\r\n"She called herself something like Dwea.... I taught her to speak\r\nEnglish a little." The commander shrugged his shoulders. "Maybe you\'ll\r\nfind a girl there, Oakey. Maybe I\'ll see mine again. That was ten\r\nyears ago." He chuckled. "She\'s probably got a husband and six kids\r\nnow."\r\n\r\nAl took a step toward the doorway marked C, one of four, each leading\r\nto a quadrant of the wagon wheel.\r\n\r\n"Please, sir," said Oakey. "Don\'t--"\r\n\r\nAl pulled open the door. "Time\'s getting short and we can\'t take the\r\nQuinnies to that planet with us." A sweep of centrifugal force caught\r\nhim as he opened the door. His big, hairy hand caught the rung of a\r\nladder beside the door. "Joe went on that trip. He and I were the only\r\nones of the crew that didn\'t catch the Quinnies the minute we landed\r\nback on earth. We ducked out again, shipping with a new commander with\r\na new crew on old Wagon Wheel again. We went to Ganymede."\r\n\r\n"Yeah," said Oakey. "I was cabin boy on that trip. My first space\r\nflight. Maybe that\'s how I escaped the Quinnies too." Oakey glanced at\r\nthe chronometer. "We\'ve still got fifty-five minutes. Why don\'t you\r\nwait twenty minutes or so?"\r\n\r\nAl heaved a sigh and swung onto the ladder, letting himself down, which\r\nwas outward, toward the rim of the wheel. "I might have trouble," he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAl put his hands against the bulkhead door. It was cool enough. The\r\nDeath Glow wasn\'t seeping into the ship. The Glow itself wasn\'t the\r\ncontagious part. It was the sparks that shot from men\'s bodies. The\r\nearly stages of the disease were the dangerous ones, for then the\r\nsparks were often too small to be seen. In the later stages a man\r\nsuffering from Quinnies gave off his own warning and could be avoided.\r\n\r\nAl took a small intercom phone from a box beside the doorway. He spoke\r\ninto it. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
"Joe."\r\n\r\nA voice came back. "Yeah. That you, commander?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Joe. How do you feel?"\r\n\r\n"Like hell, I guess. Funny though, there\'s no pain. Just annoying. Like\r\nthe hiccups. And I\'m getting weaker."\r\n\r\n"You\'re in the last stages."\r\n\r\n"Maybe. Maybe not. I\'ve heard of guys that lived fourteen months\r\nshooting sparks worse than I\'m doing right now."\r\n\r\n"I\'m coming in, Joe.

=== Chunk 8 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Give me a break, Al. I won\'t come near you or Oakey. I\'ll stay here.\r\nThere\'s food, water ... everything I need. Just let me live till it\r\nstarts to hurt. Maybe I\'ll ask you to come in then."\r\n\r\n"There isn\'t time, Joe. Besides, it\'ll be easier this way. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
You\'re\r\ndying. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
You\'re shooting sparks from your hair roots. Something might\r\nhappen and Oakey and I would come down with the Quinnies. We are the\r\nonly earthmen left now, Joe."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be too sure." Joe\'s voice was harsh, like the hissing of sparks.\r\n"You might have the Quinnies and not know it."\r\n\r\n"You\'re not in pain?

=== Chunk 11 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Hell no. 

=== Chunk 12 ===
I told you I wasn\'t. But I\'m lit up like the Fourth of July,\r\nGuy Fawkes Day, Bastille Day and the Chinese New Year."\r\n\r\n"Your brain\'s a dynamo of energy, Joe. It\'s shooting Quinnies in all\r\ndirections through every nerve fibre of your body."\r\n\r\n"Are you trying to make it easier, or something?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m trying to make you understand. I\'ve got to kill you. I\'m not doing\r\nit because I want to. You\'re my best friend, Joe. We\'ve had a lot of\r\nswell times together. But I\'ve got to kill you--Oakey and I have to\r\nland on the Green Planet and we\'re not taking the Quinnies there with\r\nus."\r\n\r\n"You\'re doing me a favor, huh? Some favor. Better make sure you haven\'t\r\ngot the Quinnies yourself before you try to make like God."\r\n\r\n"I\'d know if I had \'em," said Al. "I\'m coming in, Joe."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll kill you first," said Joe. "As a favor to myself."\r\n\r\nAl shot back the bolt. "Don\'t try it, Joe."\r\n\r\nThe commander pulled on the door. It swung open a couple of feet. A\r\nbolt of red fire swept through the opening. But Al had expected this\r\nand he was safe behind the neutralizing door. Then Al stepped into\r\nthe opening. He didn\'t need light, for Joe was a red glow against the\r\nquadrant wall.\r\n\r\nJoe stood with his feet wide apart, with an aura of fire around his\r\nbody. Flaming sparks seemed to lick the air to form an outline of a\r\nhuman being.\r\n\r\nJoe raised his finger toward the commander and Al didn\'t wait. He\r\nsqueezed the pistol\'s trigger and then stepped back behind the door as\r\nflame lashed toward him again. The report of the gun echoed.\r\n\r\n"You murderers!" Joe groaned. His body hit the floor with a thud.\r\n\r\nAl waited, then opened the door again. Joe lay on the floor. No sparks\r\ncame from his body now. He looked like a sleeping man.\r\n\r\nOutside, the cherry red glow of the quadrant ebbed till the sides were\r\nblack as space.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAl put the gun back in the drawer in the control room. He closed it and\r\nthen sank into a chair beside Oakey. The young man said nothing, but\r\nkept his eyes glued on the control panel.\r\n\r\nFinally Al spoke. "Ever take the test, Oakey?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Neither did I. Scared I might have it, I guess. But I kept telling\r\nmyself that I might catch the Quinnies from the instruments they used\r\nto test you. Anyhow, I know the symptoms. I\'d show symptoms if I had\r\nthe Quinnies, wouldn\'t I?"\r\n\r\n"Dunno. Joe knew the symptoms. He must have had it for a long time\r\nbefore he began shooting sparks." Oakey paused for a moment. "We\'ve\r\nprobably been exposed, Al."\r\n\r\n"Yeah, we\'ve been exposed a thousand times," the commander said.\r\n"Everybody on this ship except Joe and I died from the Quinnies after\r\nwe returned from that voyage ten years ago. Everybody else I sailed\r\nspace with died too--except you. There\'s some kind of immunity. Maybe\r\nwe\'ve got it. 

=== Chunk 13 ===
You and I."\r\n\r\n"The Quinnies isn\'t like measles or small pox, Al. Germs and viruses\r\ndon\'t cause it. Something goes wrong with life itself."\r\n\r\n"Maybe we should know something about life," Al grinned. "But after\r\ncenturies of finding out about everything else, we don\'t know what life\r\nis. All biologists can tell us is that we\'re molecules strung together\r\nto make cells that produce some sort of energy."\r\n\r\n"If we knew the cause of life...."\r\n\r\n"We don\'t know the cause of anything ... we get to one cause and wonder\r\nwhat caused it. We never know the first cause, and if we found it we\'d\r\nask what caused it. Everything goes around in circles. There\'s the\r\ncarbon-nitrogen-hydrogen cycle that makes the sun hot--elements change\r\nand get back to where they started, losing just a little energy. That\r\nenergy goes out into space, loses velocity and becomes matter, matter\r\nforms suns. Maybe life is part of the merry-go-round. Maybe energy\r\nmakes matter, life results from matter; life produces a little energy."\r\n\r\n"We\'re generators, huh?"\r\n\r\n"Not exactly. Did you ever study a dynamo, Oakey? It doesn\'t make\r\nenergy, it converts one form into another form, the stuff we call\r\nelectricity. But it seems to do it intelligently. Supposing your\r\ngenerator makes a kilowatt of power and you\'re lighting a string of\r\nlight bulbs with it. There\'s ten bulbs, each using 100 watts of power,\r\nbut some economical so-and-so comes along and turns out five of them.\r\nYou\'d expect the generator to get all fouled up, or maybe burn out some\r\nwires, but it goes along at the same speed and makes just 500 watts of\r\npower, no more, no less. Dynamos are like that, they never waste their\r\noutput."\r\n\r\n"Is that life?"\r\n\r\n"In a way it is," said Al. "Like I said, we\'re not generators, but life\r\nmay be just a process of making a little energy. We make just enough\r\nto keep the merry-go-round going. 

=== Chunk 14 ===
Then something goes wrong. We start\r\nmaking more than we should. We get overcharged, like a battery. The\r\nenergy has to go somewhere, so we start shooting sparks."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOakey laughed. "Your theories by-pass some of nature\'s laws and they\r\nwould make a logician take to a sick bed, but they sound good." He\r\nturned his eyes on the chronometer a moment. "What fouls up the safety\r\nvalve, as long as we\'re mixing metaphors?"\r\n\r\n"Maybe we\'ve got more than life," said Al. "We\'ve got emotions,\r\nconsciousness and a lot of things that life in general doesn\'t have.\r\nBut you and I can control our emotions. We\'re cold-blooded. I just shot\r\na friend, your friend too and you let me do it. Our cold-blooded common\r\nsense told us it was the thing to do. We have to stomp out the Quinnies\r\nbefore we land on the Green Planet. If you get the disease, I\'ll kill\r\nyou, just like I killed Joe. If I get it, you\'ll kill me--"\r\n\r\n"No, commander. I won\'t."\r\n\r\n"Then I\'ll kill myself and save you the trouble. But maybe we won\'t get\r\nit. Maybe we\'re immune for one reason or another."\r\n\r\n"We\'re not alike either in temperament or physically. I\'m young, Al.\r\nYou\'re older. You\'re a hell of a lot colder-blooded than I am. Hell,\r\nI\'ve got emotions. I couldn\'t do what you did. Organically we\'re\r\ndifferent, too. My cells may be the same, but they\'re conditioned\r\ndifferently. I\'m allergic to certain kinds of cheese--"\r\n\r\n"So are lots of people. I could establish an allergy to the same things\r\nyou can\'t take. That shows our chemistry _is_ the same."\r\n\r\nOakey glanced at the instruments again. "Better take over, sir. There\'s\r\nonly four minutes left."\r\n\r\nAl strapped himself into his seat. Oakey already had adjusted his\r\nharness and now the two men adjusted their bodies to fit the contours\r\nof the chairs that would lessen the punishment of sudden acceleration.\r\n\r\nThe commander gripped the lever that would kick atomic fuel into the\r\nrocket chambers.\r\n\r\n"One minute," said Oakey.\r\n\r\nAl injected the fuel and then placed his finger over the firing button.\r\n\r\n"Thirty seconds ... twenty ... ten ... five, four, three, two--"\r\n\r\nBoth men tensed.\r\n\r\n"--one ... ZERO!"\r\n\r\nTheir bodies strained as the ship lurched. Oakey counted the seconds\r\nwith his hand, for he could not talk now. Al squeezed the control\r\nbutton again. This was repeated again. And again. Then Al cut the\r\nrockets. The pressure on their bodies eased. Both men relaxed.\r\n\r\nAl unstrapped himself and swung his legs to the floor. He walked toward\r\nthe porthole. He had to walk carefully, for the centrifugal pitch made\r\nthe feat like balancing on a turn-table.\r\n\r\nHe reached up and adjusted the flaps. Into the room streamed warm\r\nsunlight. A glowing orb swung into view as the ship turned on its axis.\r\nA moment later they saw another disc, a bright green disc, a planet\r\nhanging in space.\r\n\r\n"We\'re there!" whispered Oakey.\r\n\r\nAl said nothing. His eyes were not on the planet, but on his hand,\r\nraised a fraction of an inch from the flap control on the metal wall of\r\nthe ship. Writhing like a snake from his fingertips to the wall, was a\r\ntiny red spark!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOakey turned his eyes from the porthole to the silent commander. He saw\r\nthe ribbon of flame. His body grew tense. Slowly his hands fingered the\r\nbuckles on the straps of his G-harness. 

=== Chunk 15 ===
He unfastened them and sprang\r\nto his feet. Al didn\'t try to stop him as Oakey swung across the\r\nturn-table room toward the tier of drawers.\r\n\r\n"Make it quick, Oakey," said Al.\r\n\r\nOakey opened the drawer, took out the gun and thrust it into his pocket.\r\n\r\n"Shoot me, Oakey. You\'ve got to. 

=== Chunk 16 ===
We can\'t take the Quinnies to that\r\nplanet!"\r\n\r\n"I won\'t."\r\n\r\n"It\'s mutiny. Give me the gun; I\'ll kill myself."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no such thing as mutiny any more, Al. We\'re just two men in\r\nspace. The last earthmen alive. The problem will solve itself."\r\n\r\n"Oakey, we\'re not going to land on the planet alive."\r\n\r\n"Be yourself. We\'ve made a good fight. We lost. Let\'s die with a solid\r\npiece of ground under our legs. What if we do infect a planet with a\r\nplague. There\'s a thousand planets just like it in the universe. Every\r\nman on them will die, if not today, then in a few years from now. What\r\ndifference does it make? 

=== Chunk 17 ===
Why should we try to keep the merry-go-round\r\ngoing?"\r\n\r\n"Because ... there\'s a reason. We don\'t know what it is, but we\'ve got\r\nto live and we\'ve got to die. But we\'ve got to preserve life every\r\nsecond we can."\r\n\r\n"Is that why you want me to kill you? To preserve life?"\r\n\r\n"One life doesn\'t matter." Al pointed to the porthole. "It\'s a whole\r\nworld of living human beings ... people like us."\r\n\r\n"We don\'t owe them anything."\r\n\r\nAl pushed himself away from the wall, toward Oakey across the room by\r\nthe tier of drawers. But the reflexes of youth were on Oakey\'s side.\r\nThe young man\'s punch caught Al flush on the jaw and the bearded\r\ncommander went down.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Al opened his eyes, Oakey was decelerating the circular ship into\r\na spiral that would set it down on the planet.\r\n\r\nAl raised himself on his arms and pulled himself toward the control\r\npanel. "You can\'t do this, Oakey. You\'re killing a world."\r\n\r\n"What\'s that world to us?"\r\n\r\nAl looked at the metal floor plates under his body. The cherry glow\r\nwas flooding from his body into the plates. Al was gone farther than\r\nhe thought. For months he must have been harboring the disease, just\r\nas Joe had been ill a long time before realizing it. Al\'s natural\r\nresistance, perhaps strengthened by long years of exposure to the\r\nradiations of space, must have held back the final stages until the\r\ntide had burst through in an overwhelming flood. Even when Al killed\r\nJoe, Al was near the last stages himself.\r\n\r\nAl remembered Joe\'s last bid for survival. Joe was much like Oakey. Joe\r\nhad hated to die, he wanted to live to have soil under his feet again.\r\nBut the disease had to be wiped out. And Joe had fought with his last\r\nweapon, the energy ebbing from his body.\r\n\r\nThe energy....\r\n\r\nGrim lines appeared deep around Al\'s eyes. He raised his hand from the\r\nfloor. His brain throbbed. Yes, his brain was a battery of energy now,\r\nthe energy of life. And the purpose of life was to preserve life, a\r\nsingle second, or a thousand million years. Not one life, but the race.\r\nThat was the aim of life.\r\n\r\n"Oakey." Al\'s voice hissed.\r\n\r\nOakey turned from the instrument panel. His eyes focussed on the cherry\r\nred floor with Al in the center of the glow.\r\n\r\nSparks came from Al\'s mouth as he spoke again. "Before I shot Joe, I\r\ntried to make him understand. I had to kill him, and I\'ve got to kill\r\nyou whether you\'ve got the disease or not. It\'s the way with things.\r\nOur individual lives don\'t mean a plugged nickel, but a whole race\r\ndoes. We can\'t take the Quinnies to the green planet."\r\n\r\n"I told you, they\'re not people like us," said Oakey. "They just look\r\nlike us. Some fish look like snakes. Some mammals look like fish. But\r\nthey\'re not fish."\r\n\r\n"But they are like us. I know," said Al. "An atom of iron on Sirius is\r\nthe same as an atom of iron on the sun. Why can\'t two human cells be\r\nthe same, even if they\'re light-years apart?"\r\n\r\n"You\'re just guessing.

=== Chunk 18 ===
"\r\n\r\n"I told you, I know."\r\n\r\n"You think you know. You met a girl once. Maybe she had a nice figure\r\nand pretty eyes. Your glands got fooled."\r\n\r\n"She was just like an earth-girl, only prettier. That\'s why--"\r\n\r\n"Maybe she was pretty, but that was ten years ago. You\'re not handsome\r\nany more and neither is she. She\'s probably got six kids, you said so\r\nyourself."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Oakey, maybe six, maybe only one kid. One that has earth blood\r\nin him. My kid, Oakey. There\'s still one more earthman alive in the\r\nuniverse. That\'s why I\'m doing this to you."\r\n\r\nAl let the energy flow out through his fingertips. A cherry red bolt\r\nstruck Oakey right in the face.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the green planet, a matron and her son were looking up into the\r\nstars. The boy cried out in delight: "A shooting star, mommy," he said.\r\n"Make a wish."\r\n\r\nTrailing red sparks, the meteor seemed to veer off suddenly and speed\r\naway again into space.\r\n\r\n"I wished that your father would return from the skies," said the\r\nwoman. "For a moment, I thought maybe he had.
