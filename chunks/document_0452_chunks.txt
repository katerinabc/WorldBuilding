]\r\n\r\n\r\nTick-de-tock, _tick-de-tock_, whispered the antique clock on the first\r\nfloor of the house.\r\n\r\nThere was no sound save for the ticking--and for the pounding of\r\nRonnie\'s heart.\r\n\r\nHe stood alone in his upstairs bedroom. His slender-boned,\r\neight-year-old body trembling, perspiration glittering on his white\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\nTo Ronnie, the clock seemed to be saying:\r\n\r\n_Daddy\'s coming, Daddy\'s coming._\r\n\r\nThe soft shadows of September twilight in this year of 2056 were\r\nseeping into the bedroom. Ronnie welcomed the fall of darkness. He\r\nwanted to sink into its deep silence, to become one with it, to escape\r\nforever from savage tongues and angry eyes.\r\n\r\nA burst of hope entered Ronnie\'s fear-filled eyes. Maybe something\r\nwould happen. Maybe Dad would have an accident. Maybe--\r\n\r\nHe bit his lip hard, shook his head. No. No matter what Dad might do,\r\nit wasn\'t right to wish--\r\n\r\nThe whirling whine of a gyro-car mushroomed up from the landing\r\nplatform outside.\r\n\r\nRonnie shivered, his pulse quickening. The muscles in his small body\r\nwere like a web of taut-drawn wires.\r\n\r\nSound and movement below. Mom flicking off the controls of the\r\nkitchen\'s Auto-Chef. The slow stride of her high heels through the\r\nliving room. The slamming of a gyro-car door. The opening of the front\r\ndoor of the house.\r\n\r\nDad\'s deep, happy voice echoed up the stairway:\r\n\r\n"Hi, beautiful!"\r\n\r\nRonnie huddled in the darkness by the half-open bedroom door.\r\n\r\n_Please, Mama_, his mind cried, _please don\'t tell Daddy what I did._\r\n\r\nThere was a droning, indistinct murmur.\r\n\r\nDad burst, "He was doing _what_?"\r\n\r\nMore murmuring.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t believe it. You really saw him?... 

=== Chunk 3 ===
I\'ll be damned."\r\n\r\nRonnie silently closed the bedroom door.\r\n\r\n_Why did you tell him, Mama? Why did you have to tell him?_\r\n\r\n"Ronnie!" Dad called.\r\n\r\nRonnie held his breath. His legs seemed as numb and nerveless as the\r\nstumps of dead trees.\r\n\r\n"_Ronnie! Come down here!_"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLike an automaton, Ronnie shuffled out of his bedroom. He stepped\r\non the big silver disk on the landing. The auto-stairs clicked into\r\nhumming movement under his weight.\r\n\r\nTo his left, on the wall, he caught kaleidoscopic glimpses of Mom\'s old\r\npictures, copies of paintings by medieval artists like Rembrandt, Van\r\nGogh, Cezanne, Dali. The faces seemed to be mocking him. Ronnie felt\r\nlike a wounded bird falling out of the sky.\r\n\r\nHe saw that Dad and Mom were waiting for him.\r\n\r\nMom\'s round blue eyes were full of mist and sadness. She hadn\'t\r\nbothered to smooth her clipped, creamy-brown hair as she always did\r\nwhen Dad was coming home.\r\n\r\nAnd Dad, handsome in his night-black, skin-tight Pentagon uniform, had\r\nbecome a hostile stranger with narrowed eyes of black fire.\r\n\r\n"Is it true, Ronnie?" asked Dad. "Were you really--really reading a\r\nbook?"\r\n\r\nRonnie gulped. He nodded.\r\n\r\n"Good Lord," Dad murmured. He took a deep breath and squatted down,\r\nheld Ronnie\'s arms and looked hard into his eyes. For an instant he\r\nbecame the kind, understanding father that Ronnie knew.\r\n\r\n"Tell me all about it, son. Where did you get the book? Who taught you\r\nto read?"\r\n\r\nRonnie tried to keep his legs from shaking. "It was--Daddy, you won\'t\r\nmake trouble, will you?"\r\n\r\n"This is between you and me, son. We don\'t care about anyone else."\r\n\r\n"Well, it was Kenny Davis. He--"\r\n\r\nDad\'s fingers tightened on Ronnie\'s arms. "Kenny Davis!" he spat. "The\r\nboy\'s no good. His father never had a job in his life. Nobody\'d even\r\noffer him a job. Why, the whole town knows he\'s a Reader!"\r\n\r\nMom stepped forward. "David, you promised you\'d be sensible about this.\r\nYou promised you wouldn\'t get angry."\r\n\r\nDad grunted. "All right, son. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Go ahead."\r\n\r\n"Well, one day after school Kenny said he\'d show me something. He took\r\nme to his house--"\r\n\r\n"You went to that _shack_? You actually--"\r\n\r\n"Dear," said Mom. "You promised."\r\n\r\nA moment of silence.\r\n\r\nRonnie said, "He took me to his house. I met his dad. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Mr. Davis is lots\r\nof fun. He has a beard and he paints pictures and he\'s collected almost\r\nfive hundred books."\r\n\r\nRonnie\'s voice quavered.\r\n\r\n"Go on," said Dad sternly.\r\n\r\n"And I--and Mr. Davis said he\'d teach me to read them if I promised not\r\nto tell anybody. So he taught me a little every day after school--oh,\r\nDad, books are fun to read. They tell you things you can\'t see on the\r\nvideo or hear on the tapes."\r\n\r\n"How long ago did all this start?\r\n\r\n"T--two years ago."\r\n\r\nDad rose, fists clenched, staring strangely at nothing.\r\n\r\n"Two years," he breathed. "I thought I had a good son, and yet for two\r\nyears--" He shook his head unbelievingly. "Maybe it\'s my own fault.\r\nMaybe I shouldn\'t have come to this small town. I should have taken a\r\nhouse in Washington instead of trying to commute."\r\n\r\n"David," said Mom, very seriously, almost as if she were praying, "it\r\nwon\'t be necessary to have him memory-washed, will it?"\r\n\r\nDad looked at Mom, frowning. Then he gazed at Ronnie. His soft-spoken\r\nwords were as ominous as the low growl of thunder:\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, Edith. I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDad strode to his easy chair by the fireplace. He sank into its\r\nfoam-rubber softness, sighing. He murmured a syllable into a tiny\r\nball-mike on the side of the chair. A metallic hand raised a lighted\r\ncigarette to his lips.\r\n\r\n"Come here, son."\r\n\r\nRonnie followed and sat on the hassock by Dad\'s feet.\r\n\r\n"Maybe I\'ve never really explained things to you, Ronnie. You see, you\r\nwon\'t always be a boy. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Someday you\'ll have to find a way of making a\r\nliving. You\'ve only two choices: You work for the government, like I\r\ndo, or for a corporation."\r\n\r\nRonnie blinked. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
"Mr. Davis doesn\'t work for the gover\'ment or for a\r\ncorpor-ation."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Davis isn\'t normal," Dad snapped. "He\'s a hermit. No decent family\r\nwould let him in their house. He grows his own food and sometimes he\r\ntakes care of gardens for people. I want you to have more than that. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
I\r\nwant you to have a nice home and be respected by people."\r\n\r\nDad puffed furiously on his cigarette.\r\n\r\n"And you can\'t get ahead if people know you\'ve been a Reader. That\'s\r\nsomething you can\'t live down. No matter how hard you try, people\r\nalways stumble upon the truth."\r\n\r\nDad cleared his throat. "You see, when you get a job, all the\r\ninformation you handle will have a classification. It\'ll be Restricted,\r\nLow-Confidential, Confidential, High-Confidential, Secret, Top-Secret.\r\nAnd all this information will be in writing. No matter what you do,\r\nyou\'ll have access to some of this information at one time or another."\r\n\r\n"B--but why do these things have to be so secret?" Ronnie asked.\r\n\r\n"Because of competitors, in the case of corporations--or because of\r\nenemy nations in the case of government work. The written material you\r\nmight have access to could describe secret weapons and new processes\r\nor plans for next year\'s advertising--maybe even a scheme for, er,\r\nliquidation of a rival. If all facts and policies were made public,\r\nthere might be criticism, controversy, opposition by certain groups.\r\nThe less people know about things, the better. So we have to keep all\r\nthese things secret."\r\n\r\nRonnie scowled. "But if things are written down, someone has to read\r\nthem, don\'t they?"\r\n\r\n"Sure, son. One person in ten thousand might reach the point where\r\nhis corporation or bureau will teach him to read. But you prove your\r\nability and loyalty first. By the time you\'re 35 or 40, they might\r\n_want_ you to learn to read. But for young people and children--well,\r\nit just isn\'t done. Why, the President himself wasn\'t trusted to learn\r\ntill he was nearly fifty!"\r\n\r\nDad straightened his shoulders. "Look at me. I\'m only 30, but I\'ve been\r\na messenger for Secret material already. In a few years, if things go\r\nwell, I should be handling _Top_-Secret stuff. And who knows? Maybe by\r\nthe time I\'m 50 I\'ll be _giving_ orders instead of carrying them. Then\r\nI\'ll learn to read, too. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
That\'s the right way to do it."\r\n\r\nRonnie shifted uncomfortably on the hassock. "But can\'t a Reader get a\r\njob that\'s not so important. Like a barber or a plumber or--"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you understand? The barber and plumbing equipment corporations\r\nset up their stores and hire men to work for them. You think they\'d\r\nhire a Reader? People\'d say you were a spy or a subversive or that\r\nyou\'re crazy like old man Davis."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Davis isn\'t crazy. And he isn\'t old. He\'s young, just like you,\r\nand--"\r\n\r\n"Ronnie!"\r\n\r\nDad\'s voice was knife-sharp and December-cold. Ronnie slipped off the\r\nhassock as if struck physically by the fury of the voice. He sat\r\nsprawled on his small posterior, fresh fear etched on his thin features.\r\n\r\n"Damn it, son, how could you even _think_ of being a Reader? You\'ve got\r\na life-sized, 3-D video here, and we put on the smell and touch and\r\nheat attachments just for you. You can listen to any tape in the world\r\nat school. Ronnie, don\'t you realize I\'d lose my job if people knew I\r\nhad a Reader for a son?"\r\n\r\n"B--but, Daddy--"\r\n\r\nDad jumped to his feet. "I hate to say it, Edith, but we\'ve got to put\r\nthis boy in a reformatory. Maybe a good memory-wash will take some of\r\nthe nonsense out of him!

=== Chunk 10 ===
"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRonnie suppressed a sob. "No, Daddy, don\'t let them take away my brain.\r\nPlease--"\r\n\r\nDad stood very tall and very stiff, not even looking at him. "They\r\nwon\'t take your brain, just your memory for the past two years."\r\n\r\nA corner of Mom\'s mouth twitched. "David, I didn\'t want anything like\r\nthis. I thought maybe Ronnie could have a few private psychiatric\r\ntreatments. They can do wonderful things now--permi-hypnosis, creations\r\nof artificial psychic blocks. A memory-wash would mean that Ronnie\'d\r\nhave the mind of a six-year-old child again. He\'d have to start to\r\nschool all over again."\r\n\r\nDad returned to his chair. He buried his face in trembling hands, and\r\nsome of his anger seemed replaced by despair. "Lord, Edith, I don\'t\r\nknow what to do."\r\n\r\nHe looked up abruptly, as if struck by a chilling new thought. "You\r\ncan\'t keep a two-year memory-wash a secret. I never thought of that\r\nbefore. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
Why, that alone would mean the end of my promotions."\r\n\r\nSilence settled over the room, punctuated only by the ticking of the\r\nantique clock. All movement seemed frozen, as if the room lay at the\r\nbottom of a cold, thick sea.\r\n\r\n"David," Mom finally said.\r\n\r\n"Yes?"\r\n\r\n"There\'s only one solution. 

=== Chunk 12 ===
We can\'t destroy two years of Ronnie\'s\r\nmemory--you said that yourself. So we\'ll have to take him to a\r\npsychiatrist or maybe a psychoneurologist. A few short treatments--"\r\n\r\nDad interrupted: "But he\'d _still_ remember how to read, unconsciously\r\nanyway. Even permi-hypnosis would wear off in time. The boy can\'t keep\r\ngoing to psychiatrists for the rest of his life."\r\n\r\nThoughtfully he laced his fingers together. "Edith, what kind of a book\r\nwas he reading?"\r\n\r\nA tremor passed through Mom\'s slender body. "There were three books on\r\nhis bed. I\'m not sure which one he was actually reading."\r\n\r\nDad groaned. "_Three_ of them. Did you burn them?"\r\n\r\n"No, dear, not yet."\r\n\r\n"Why not?

=== Chunk 13 ===
"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. Ronnie seemed to like them so much. I thought that maybe\r\ntonight, after you d seen them--"\r\n\r\n"Get them, damn it. Let\'s burn the filthy things."\r\n\r\nMom went to a mahogany chest in the dining room, produced three faded\r\nvolumes. She put them on the hassock at Dad\'s feet.\r\n\r\nDad gingerly turned a cover. His lips curled in disgust as if he were\r\ntouching a rotting corpse.\r\n\r\n"Old," he mused, "--so very old. Ironic, isn\'t it? Our lives are being\r\nwrecked by things that should have been destroyed and forgotten a\r\nhundred years ago."\r\n\r\nA sudden frown contorted his dark features.\r\n\r\n_Tick-de-tock, tick-de-tock_, said the antique clock.\r\n\r\n"A hundred years old," he repeated. His mouth became a hard, thin line.\r\n"Edith, I think I know why Ronnie wanted to read, why he fell into the\r\ntrap so easily."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean, David?"\r\n\r\nDad nodded at the clock, and the slow, smouldering anger returned to\r\nhis face. "It\'s _your_ fault, Edith. You\'ve always liked old things.\r\nThat clock of your great-great-grandmother\'s. Those old prints on the\r\nwall. That stamp collection you started for Ronnie--stamps dated way\r\nback to the 1940\'s."\r\n\r\nMom\'s face paled. "I don\'t understand."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve interested Ronnie in old things. To a child in its formative\r\nyears, in a pleasant house, these things symbolize peace and security.\r\nRonnie\'s been conditioned from the very time of his birth to like old\r\nthings. It was natural for him to be attracted by books. And we were\r\njust too stupid to realize it."\r\n\r\nMom whispered hoarsely, "I\'m sorry, David."\r\n\r\nHot anger flashed in Dad\'s eyes. "It isn\'t enough to be sorry. Don\'t\r\nyou see what this means? Ronnie\'ll have to be memory-washed back to the\r\ntime of birth. He\'ll have to start life all over again."\r\n\r\n"No, David, no!"\r\n\r\n"And in my position I can\'t afford to have an eight-year-old son with\r\nthe mind of a new-born baby. It\'s got to be Abandonment, Edith, there\'s\r\nno other way. The boy can start life over in a reformatory, with a\r\ncomplete memory-wash. He\'ll never know we existed, and he\'ll never\r\nbother us again."\r\n\r\nMom ran up to Dad. She put her hands on his shoulders. Great sobs burst\r\nfrom her shaking body.\r\n\r\n"You can\'t, David! I won\'t let--"\r\n\r\nHe slapped her then with the palm of his hand. The sound was like a\r\npistol shot in the hot, tight air.\r\n\r\nDad stood now like a colossus carved of black ice. His right hand was\r\nstill upraised, ready to strike again.\r\n\r\nThen his hand fell. His mind seemed to be toying with a new thought, a\r\nnew concept.\r\n\r\nHe seized one of the books on the hassock.\r\n\r\n"Edith," he said crisply, "just what was Ronnie reading? What\'s the\r\nname of this book?"\r\n\r\n"_The--The Adventures of Tom Sawyer_," said Mom through her sobs.\r\n\r\nHe grabbed the second book, held it before her shimmering vision.\r\n\r\n"And the name of this?"\r\n\r\n"_Tarzan of The Apes._" Mom\'s voice was a barely audible croak.\r\n\r\n"Who\'s the author?"\r\n\r\n"Edgar Rice Burroughs."\r\n\r\n"And this one?"\r\n\r\n"_The Wizard of Oz._"\r\n\r\n"Who wrote it?"\r\n\r\n"L. Frank Baum."\r\n\r\nHe threw the books to the floor. He stepped backward. His face was a\r\nmask of combined sorrow, disbelief, and rage.\r\n\r\n"_Edith._" He spat the name as if it were acid on his tongue. "Edith,\r\n_you can read_!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMom sucked in her sobs. Her chalk-white cheeks were still streaked with\r\nrivulets of tears.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry, David. I\'ve never told anyone--not even Ronnie. I haven\'t\r\nread a book, haven\'t even looked at one since we were married. I\'ve\r\ntried to be a good wife--"\r\n\r\n"A good wife." Dad sneered. His face was so ugly that Ronnie looked\r\naway.\r\n\r\nMom continued, "I--I learned when I was just a girl. I was young like\r\nRonnie. You know how young people are--reckless, eager to do forbidden\r\nthings."\r\n\r\n"You lied to me," Dad snapped. "For ten years you\'ve lied to me. Why\r\ndid you want to read, Edith? _Why?_"\r\n\r\nMom was silent for a few seconds. She was breathing heavily, but no\r\nlonger crying. A calmness entered her features, and for the first time\r\ntonight Ronnie saw no fear in her eyes.\r\n\r\n"I wanted to read," she said, her voice firm and proud, "because, as\r\nRonnie said, it\'s fun. The video\'s nice, with its dancers and lovers\r\nand Indians and spacemen--but sometimes you want more than that.\r\nSometimes you want to know how people feel deep inside and how they\r\nthink. And there are beautiful words and beautiful thoughts, just like\r\nthere are beautiful paintings. It isn\'t enough just to hear them and\r\nthen forget them. Sometimes you want to keep the words and thoughts\r\nbefore you because in that way you feel that they belong to you."\r\n\r\nHer words echoed in the room until absorbed by the ceaseless, ticking\r\nclock. Mom stood straight and unashamed. Dad\'s gaze traveled slowly to\r\nRonnie, to Mom, to the clock, back and forth.\r\n\r\nAt last he said, "Get out."\r\n\r\nMom stared blankly.\r\n\r\n"Get out. Both of you. 

=== Chunk 14 ===
You can send for your things later. I never want\r\nto see either of you again."\r\n\r\n"David--"\r\n\r\n"I said _get out_!"\r\n\r\nRonnie and Mom left the house. Outside, the night was dark and a wind\r\nwas rising. Mom shivered in her thin house cloak.\r\n\r\n"Where will we go, Ronnie? Where, where--"\r\n\r\n"I know a place. Maybe we can stay there--for a little while."\r\n\r\n"A little while?" Mom echoed. Her mind seemed frozen by the cold wind.\r\n\r\nRonnie led her through the cold, windy streets. They left the lights of\r\nthe town behind them. They stumbled over a rough, dirt country road.\r\nThey came to a small, rough-boarded house in the deep shadow of an\r\neucalyptus grove. The windows of the house were like friendly eyes of\r\nwarm golden light.\r\n\r\nAn instant later a door opened and a small boy ran out to meet them.\r\n\r\n"Hi, Kenny."\r\n\r\n"Hi. Who\'s that? 

=== Chunk 15 ===
Your mom?"\r\n\r\n"Yep. Mr. Davis in?"\r\n\r\n"Sure."\r\n\r\nAnd a kindly-faced, bearded young man appeared in the golden doorway,\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\nRonnie and Mom stepped inside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
