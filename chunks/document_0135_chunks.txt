We maybe borrowed a couple of\r\nthings, like. But, gee, we put everything back like we found it, pretty\r\nnear.\r\n\r\nEven like the compressor we got from Stinky Brinker that his old man\r\nwasn't using and I traded my outboard motor for, my old m ... my father\r\nmade me trade back. But it was like Skinny said ... You know, Skinny.\r\nSkinny Thompson. He's the one you guys keep calling the boy genius, but\r\nshucks, he's no ...\r\n\r\nWell, yeah, it's like Skinny said, we didn't need an outboard motor, and\r\nwe did need a compressor. You've got to have a compressor on a\r\nspaceship, everybody knows that. And that old compression chamber that\r\nold man ... I mean _Mr._ Fields let us use didn't have a compressor.\r\n\r\nSure he said we could use it. Anyway he said we could play with it, and\r\nSkinny said we were going to make a spaceship out of it, and he said go\r\nahead.\r\n\r\nWell, no, he didn't say it exactly like that. I mean, well, like he\r\ndidn't take it serious, sort of.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it made a swell spaceship. It had four portholes on it and an\r\nair lock and real bunks in it and lots of room for all that stuff that\r\nSkinny put in there. But it didn't have a compressor and that's why ...\r\n\r\nWhat stuff? Oh, you know, the stuff that Skinny put in there. Like the\r\nradar he made out of a TV set and the antigravity and the atomic power\r\nplant he invented to run it all with.\r\n\r\nHe's awful smart, Skinny is, but he's not like what you think of a\r\ngenius. You know, he's not all the time using big words, and he doesn't\r\nlook like a genius. I mean, we call him Skinny 'cause he used to\r\nbe--Skinny.\r\n\r\nBut he isn't now, I mean he's maybe small for his age, anyway he's\r\nsmaller than me, and I'm the same age as he is. 'Course, I'm big for my\r\nage, so that doesn't mean much, does it?\r\n\r\nWell, I guess Stinker Brinker started it. He's always riding Skinny\r\nabout one thing or another, but Skinny never gets mad and it's a good\r\nthing for Stinker, too. I saw Skinny clean up on a bunch of ninth\r\ngraders ... Well, a couple of them anyway. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
They were saying ... Well, I\r\nguess I won't tell you what they were saying. Anyway, Skinny used judo,\r\nI guess, because there wasn't much of a fight.\r\n\r\nAnyway, Stinker said something about how he was going to be a rocket\r\npilot when he grew up, and I told him that Skinny had told me that there\r\nwouldn't be any rockets, and that antigravity would be the thing as soon\r\nas it was invented. So Stinker said it never would be invented, and I\r\nsaid it would so, and he said it would not, and I said ...\r\n\r\nWell, if you're going to keep interrupting me, how can I ...\r\n\r\nAll right. Anyway, Skinny broke into the argument and said that he could\r\nprove mathematically that antigravity was possible, and Stinky said\r\nsuure he could, and Skinny said sure he could, and Stinky said suuure he\r\ncould, like that. Honestly, is that any way to argue? I mean it sounds\r\nlike two people agreeing, only Stinky keeps going suuure, like that, you\r\nknow? And Stinky, what does he know about mathematics? He's had to take\r\nRemedial Arithmetic ever since ...\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNo, I don't understand how the antigravity works. Skinny told me, but it\r\nwas something about meson flow and stuff like that that I didn't\r\nunderstand. The atomic power plant made more sense.\r\n\r\nWhere did we get what uranium? Gee, no, we couldn't afford uranium, so\r\nSkinny invented a hydrogen fusion plant. Anyone can make hydrogen. You\r\njust take zinc and sulfuric acid and ...\r\n\r\nDeuterium? You mean like heavy hydrogen? No, Skinny said it would\r\nprobably work better, but like I said, we couldn't afford anything\r\nfancy. As it was, Skinny had to pay five or six dollars for that special\r\nsquare tubing in the antigravity, and the plastic space helmets we had\r\ncost us ninety-eight cents each. And it cost a dollar and a half for\r\nthe special tube that Skinny needed to make the TV set into a radar.\r\n\r\nYou see, we didn't steal anything, really. It was mostly stuff that was\r\njust lying around. Like the TV set was up in my attic, and the old\r\nrefrigerator that Skinny used the parts to make the atomic power plant\r\nout of from. And then, a lot of the stuff we already had. Like the skin\r\ndiving suits we made into spacesuits and the vacuum pump that Skinny had\r\nalready and the generator.\r\n\r\nSure, we did a lot of skin diving, but that was last summer. That's how\r\nwe knew about old man Brinker's compressor that Stinky said was his and\r\nI traded my outboard motor for and had to trade back. And that's how we\r\nknew about Mr. Fields' old compression chamber, and all like that.\r\n\r\nThe rocket? Well, it works on the same principle as the atomic power\r\nplant, only it doesn't work except in a vacuum, hardly. Course you don't\r\nneed much of a rocket when you have antigravity. Everyone knows that.\r\n\r\nWell, anyway, that's how we built the spaceship, and believe me, it\r\nwasn't easy. I mean with Stinky all the time bothering us and laughing\r\nat us. And I had to do a lot of lawn mowing to get money for the square\r\ntubing for the antigravity and the special tube for the radar, and my\r\nspace helmet.\r\n\r\nStinky called the space helmets kid stuff. He was always saying things\r\nlike say hello to the folks on Mars for me, and bring back a bottle of\r\ncanal number five, and all like that, you know. Course, they did look\r\nlike kid stuff, I guess. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
We bought them at the five-and-dime, and they\r\nwere meant for kids. Of course when Skinny got through with them, they\r\nworked fine.\r\n\r\nWe tested them in the air lock of the compression chamber when we got\r\nthe compressor in. They tested out pretty good for a half-hour, then we\r\ntried them on in there. Well, it wasn't a complete vacuum, just\r\ntwenty-seven inches of mercury, but that was O.K. for a test.\r\n\r\nSo anyway, we got ready to take off. Stinky was there to watch, of\r\ncourse. He was saying things like, farewell, O brave pioneers, and stuff\r\nlike that. I mean it was enough to make you sick.\r\n\r\nHe was standing there laughing and singing something like up in the air\r\njunior birdmen, but when we closed the air-lock door, we couldn't hear\r\nhim. Skinny started up the atomic power plant, and we could see Stinky\r\nlaughing fit to kill. It takes a couple of minutes for it to warm up,\r\nyou know. So Stinky started throwing rocks to attract our attention, and\r\nSkinny was scared that he'd crack a porthole or something, so he threw\r\nthe switch and we took off.\r\n\r\nBoy, you should of seen Stinky's face. I mean you really should of seen\r\nit. One minute he was laughing you know, and the next minute he looked\r\nlike a goldfish. I guess he always did look like a goldfish, but I mean\r\neven more like, then. And he was getting smaller and smaller, because we\r\nhad taken off.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe were gone pretty near six hours, and it's a good thing my Mom made me\r\ntake a lunch. Sure, I told her where we were going. Well ... anyway I\r\ntold her we were maybe going to fly around the world in Skinny and my\r\nspaceship, or maybe go down to Carson's pond. And she made me take a\r\nlunch and made me promise I wouldn't go swimming alone, and I sure\r\ndidn't.\r\n\r\nBut we did go around the world three or four times. I lost count. Anyway\r\nthat's when we saw the satellite--on radar. So Skinny pulled the\r\nspaceship over to it and we got out and looked at it. The spacesuits\r\nworked fine, too.\r\n\r\nGosh no, we didn't steal it or anything. Like Skinny said, it was just a\r\nmenace to navigation, and the batteries were dead, and it wasn't working\r\nright anyway. So we tied it onto the spaceship and took it home. No, we\r\nhad to tie it on top, it was too big to take inside with the antennas\r\nsticking out. Course, we found out how to fold them later.\r\n\r\nWell, anyway the next day, the Russians started squawking about a\r\ncapitalist plot, and someone had swiped their satellite. Gee, I mean\r\nwith all the satellites up there, who'd miss just one?\r\n\r\nSo I got worried that they'd find out that we took it. Course, I didn't\r\nneed to worry, because Stinky told them all right, just like a\r\ntattletale.\r\n\r\nSo anyway, after Skinny got the batteries recharged, we put it back. And\r\nthen when we landed there were hundreds of people standing around, and\r\nMr. Anderson from the State Department. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
I guess you know the rest.\r\n\r\nExcept maybe Mr. Anderson started laughing when we told him, and he said\r\nit was the best joke on the Russians he ever heard.\r\n\r\nI guess it is when you think about it. I mean, the Russians complaining\r\nabout somebody swiping their satellite and then the State Department\r\nanswering a couple of kids borrowed it, but they put it back.\r\n\r\nOne thing that bothers me though, we didn't put it back exactly the way\r\nwe found it. But I guess it doesn't matter. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
You see, when we put it\r\nback, we goofed a little. I mean, we put it back in the same orbit, more\r\nor less, but we got it going in the wrong direction.\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
