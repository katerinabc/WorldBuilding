For two\r\nblocks ahead of me, Main Street was gutter to gutter with stalled cars,\r\ntrucks and buses.\r\n\r\nIf I hadn\'t been in such a hurry to get back to the shop, I might have\r\npaid more attention. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
I might have noticed nobody was leaning on his\r\nhorn. Or that at least a quarter of the drivers were out peering under\r\ntheir hoods.\r\n\r\nBut at the time it didn\'t register. I gave the tie-up a passing glance\r\nand was turning up the side street toward Biltom Electronics--Bill-Tom,\r\nget it?--when I saw Marge threading her way to the curb. She was leading\r\na small blonde girl of about eight, who clutched a child-size hatbox in\r\nher hand. Marge was hot and exasperated, but small fry was as cool and\r\ncomposed as a vanilla cone.\r\n\r\nI waited. Even flushed and disheveled, Marge is a treat to look at. She\r\nis tall and slender, with brown eyes that match her hair, a smile that\r\nfirst crinkles around her eyes, then sneaks down and becomes a\r\nfull-fledged grin--\r\n\r\nBut I\'m getting off the subject.\r\n\r\n"Honestly, Bill!" Marge said as she saw me. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
"The traffic nowadays! We\'ve\r\nbeen tied up for fifteen minutes. I finally decided to get off the bus\r\nand walk, even though it is about a hundred in the shade."\r\n\r\n"Come along to the shop," I suggested. "The reception room is\r\nair-conditioned and you can watch the world\'s first baseball game\r\ntelecast in color. The Giants versus the Dodgers, Carl Erskine\r\npitching."\r\n\r\nMarge brightened. "That\'ll be more fun than shopping, won\'t it, Doreen?"\r\nshe asked, looking down at the kid. "Bill, this is Doreen. She lives\r\nacross the street from me. Her mother\'s at the dentist and I said I\'d\r\nlook after her for the day."\r\n\r\n"Hello, Doreen," I said. "What have you in the hatbox? Doll clothes?"\r\n\r\nDoreen gave me a look of faint disgust. "No," she piped, in a high\r\ntreble. "An unhappy genii."\r\n\r\n"An unhappy--" I did a double take. "Oh, an unhappy genii? Maybe he\'s\r\nunhappy because you won\'t let him out, ha ha." Even to myself, I sounded\r\nidiotic.\r\n\r\nDoreen looked at me pityingly. "It\'s not a he, it\'s a thing. Elmer made\r\nit."\r\n\r\nI knew when I was losing, so I quit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI hurried Marge and Doreen along toward our little two-story building.\r\nOnce we got into the air-conditioned reception room, Marge sank down\r\ngratefully onto the settee and I switched on the television set with the\r\nbig 24-inch tube Tom had built.\r\n\r\nBiltom Electronics makes TV components, computer parts, things like\r\nthat. Tom Kennedy is the brains. Me, Bill Rawlins, I do the legwork, and\r\ntend to the business details.\r\n\r\n"It\'s uncanny the way all those cars suddenly stopped when our bus broke\r\ndown," Marge said as we waited for the picture to come on. "Any day now\r\nthis civilization of ours will get so complicated a bus breaking down\r\nsomeplace will bring the whole thing to a halt. Then where will we be?"\r\n\r\n"Elmer says silly-zation is doomed!" Doreen put in happily.\r\n\r\nThe way she rolled the word out made me stare at her.\r\n\r\nMarge only nodded. "That\'s what Elmer says, all right," she agreed, a\r\ntrifle grim.\r\n\r\n"Why does Elmer say silly-zation is doomed?" I asked Doreen.\r\n\r\n"Because it\'s getting hotter." The kid gave it to me straight. "All the\r\nice at the North Pole is gonna melt. The ocean is gonna rise two hundred\r\nfeet. Then everybody who doesn\'t live on a hill is gonna be drownded.\r\nThat\'s what Elmer says and Elmer isn\'t ever wrong."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Illustrated by CAVAT]\r\n\r\nDoreen they called her! Why not Cassandra? The stuff kids spout these\r\ndays!\r\n\r\nI gave her a foolish grin. I wanted Marge to get the idea I was really a\r\nfamily man at heart. "That\'s very interesting, Doreen. Now look, there\'s\r\nthe baseball game. Let\'s watch, shall we?"\r\n\r\nWe weren\'t very late after all. It was the top half of the second\r\ninning, the score one to one, Erskine in trouble with two men on and\r\nonly one down. The colors were beautiful. Marge and I were just settling\r\nback to watch when Doreen wrinkled her nose.\r\n\r\n"I saw that game yesterday!" she announced.\r\n\r\n"You couldn\'t have, sweetheart," I told her. "Because it\'s only being\r\nplayed today. The world\'s first ball game ever broadcast in color."\r\n\r\n"There was a game on Elmer\'s TV," Doreen insisted. "The picture was\r\nbigger and the colors prettier, too."\r\n\r\n"Absolutely impossible." I was a little sore. I hate kids who tell fibs.\r\n"There never was a game broadcast in color before. And, anyway, you\r\nwon\'t find a color tube this big any place outside of a laboratory."\r\n\r\n"But it\'s true, Bill." Marge looked at me, wide-eyed. "Elmer only has a\r\nlittle seven-inch black and white set his uncle gave him. But he\'s\r\nrigged up some kind of lens in front of it, and it projects a big color\r\npicture on a white screen."\r\n\r\nI saw that she was serious. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
My eyes bugged slightly. "Listen," I said,\r\n"who is this Elmer character? I want to meet him!"\r\n\r\n"He\'s my cousin from South America," Doreen answered. "He thinks\r\ngrownups are stupid." 

=== Chunk 5 ===
She turned to Marge. "I have to go to the\r\nbathroom," she said primly.\r\n\r\n"Through that door." Marge pointed.\r\n\r\nDoreen trotted out, clutching her hat box.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Elmer thinks grownups are stupid?" I howled. "Listen, how old is this\r\ncharacter who says silly-zation is doomed and can convert a black and\r\nwhite broadcast into color?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s thirteen," Marge told me. I goggled at her. "Thirteen," she\r\nrepeated. "His father is some South American scientist. His mother died\r\nten years ago."\r\n\r\nI sat down beside her. I lit a cigarette. My hands were shaking. "Tell\r\nme about him. _All_ about him."\r\n\r\n"Why, I don\'t know very much," Marge said. "Last year Elmer was sick,\r\nsome tropic disease. His father sent him up here to recuperate. Now\r\nAlice--that\'s his aunt, Doreen\'s mother--is at her wits\' end, he makes\r\nher so nervous."\r\n\r\nI lit another cigarette before I realized I already had one. "And he\r\ninvents things? A boy genius? Young Tom Edison and all that?"\r\n\r\nMarge frowned. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
"I suppose you could say that," she conceded. "He has the\r\ngarage full of stuff he\'s made or bought with the allowance his father\r\nsends him. And if you come within ten feet of it without permission, you\r\nget an electric shock right out of thin air. But that\'s only part of it.\r\nIt--" she gave a helpless gesture--"it\'s Elmer\'s effect on everybody.\r\nEverybody over fifteen, that is. He sits there, a little, dark,\r\nsquinched-up kid wearing thick glasses and talking about how climatic\r\nchanges inside fifty years will flood half the world, cause the collapse\r\nof civilization--"\r\n\r\n"Wait a minute!" I cut in. "Scientists seem to think that\'s possible in\r\na few thousand years. Not fifty."\r\n\r\n"Elmer says fifty," Marge stated flatly. "From the way he talks, I\r\nsuspect he\'s figured out a way to speed things up and is going to try it\r\nsome day just to see if it works. Meanwhile he fools around out there in\r\nthe garage, sneering about the billions of dollars spent to develop\r\ncolor TV. He says his lens will turn any ordinary broadcast into color\r\nfor about twenty-five dollars. He says it\'s typical of the muddled\r\nthinking of our so-called scientists--I\'m quoting now--to do everything\r\nbackward and overlook fundamental principles."\r\n\r\n"Bro-ther!" I said.\r\n\r\nDoreen came trotting back in then, with her hat box. "I\'m tired of that\r\ngame," she said, giving the TV set a bored glance. And as she said it\r\nthe tube went dark. The sound cut off.\r\n\r\n"Damn!" I swore. "Must be a power failure!" I grabbed the phone and\r\njiggled the hook. No dice. The phone was dead, too.\r\n\r\n"You\'re funny," Doreen giggled. "It\'s just the unhappy genii. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
See?"\r\n\r\nShe flicked over the catch on the hatbox.\r\n\r\nAnd the picture came back on. The sound started up. "--swings and misses\r\nfor strike two!" The air conditioner began to hum.\r\n\r\nMarge and I stared. Mouths open. Wide.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"You did that, Doreen?" I asked it very carefully. "You made the\r\ntelevision stop and start again?"\r\n\r\n"The unhappy genii did," Doreen told me. "Like this." 

=== Chunk 8 ===
She flicked the\r\ncatch back. The TV picture blacked out. The sound stopped in the middle\r\nof a word. The air conditioner whispered into silence.\r\n\r\nThen she flipped the catch the other way.\r\n\r\n"--fouls the second ball into the screen," the announcer said. Picture\r\nokay. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
Air conditioner operating. Everything normal except my pulse and\r\nrespiration.\r\n\r\n"Doreen, sweetheart--" I took a step toward her--"what\'s in that box?\r\nWhat _is_ an unhappy genii?"\r\n\r\n"Not unhappy." You know how scornful an eight-year-old can be? Well, she\r\nwas. "Unhap-_pen_. It makes things unhappen. Anything that works by\r\nelectracity, it stops. Elmer calls it his unhappen genii. Just for fun.

=== Chunk 10 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Oh, now I get it," I said brightly. "It makes electricity not\r\nwork--unhappen. Like television sets and air conditioners and\r\nautomobiles and bus engines."\r\n\r\nDoreen giggled.\r\n\r\nMarge sat bolt upright. "Doreen! _You_ caused that traffic jam? You and\r\nthat--that gadget of Elmer\'s?"\r\n\r\nDoreen nodded. "It made all the automobile engines stop, just like Elmer\r\nsaid. Elmer\'s never wrong."\r\n\r\nMarge looked at me. I looked at Marge.\r\n\r\n"A field of some kind," I said. "A field that prevents an electric\r\ncurrent from flowing. Meaning no combustion motor using an electric\r\nspark can operate. No electric motors. No telephones. No radio or TV."\r\n\r\n"Is that important?" Marge asked.\r\n\r\n"Important?" I yelled. "Think of the possibilities just as a weapon! You\r\ncould blank out a whole nation\'s transportation, its communications, its\r\nindustry--"\r\n\r\nI got hold of myself. I smiled my best I-love-children smile. "Doreen,"\r\nI said, "let me look at Elmer\'s unhappen genii."\r\n\r\nThe kid clutched the box.\r\n\r\n"Elmer told me not to let anybody look at it. He said he\'d statuefy me\r\nif I did. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
He said nobody would understand it anyway. He said he might\r\nshow it to Mr. Einstein, but not anybody else."\r\n\r\n"That\'s Elmer, all right," Marge muttered.\r\n\r\nI found myself breathing hard. I edged toward Doreen and put my hand on\r\nthe hatbox. "Just one quick look, Doreen," I said. "No one will ever\r\nknow."\r\n\r\nShe didn\'t answer. Just pulled the box away.\r\n\r\nI pulled it back.\r\n\r\nShe pulled.\r\n\r\nI pulled.\r\n\r\n"Bill--" Marge called warningly. Too late. The lid of the hatbox came\r\noff in my hands.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was a bright flash, the smell of insulation burning, and the\r\nunhappen genii fell out and scattered all over the floor.\r\n\r\nDoreen looked smug. "Now Elmer will be angry at you. Maybe he\'ll\r\ndisintegrate you. Or paralalize you and statuefy you. Forever."\r\n\r\n"He might at that, Bill," Marge shuddered. "I wouldn\'t put anything past\r\nhim."\r\n\r\nI wasn\'t listening. I was scrambling after the mess of tubes, condensers\r\nand power packs scattered over the rug. Some of them were still wired\r\ntogether, but most of them had broken loose. Elmer was certainly one\r\nheck of a sloppy workman. Hadn\'t even soldered the connections. Just\r\ntwisted the wires together.\r\n\r\nI looked at the stuff in my hands. It made as much sense as a radio run\r\nover by a truck.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll take it back to Elmer," I told Doreen, speaking very carefully.\r\n"I\'ll give him lots of money to build another. He can come down here and\r\nuse our shop. We have lots of nice equipment he\'d like."\r\n\r\nDoreen tossed her head. "I don\'t think he\'ll wanta. He\'ll be mad at you.\r\nAnyway, Elmer is busy working on aggravation now."\r\n\r\n"That\'s for sure!" Marge said in heartfelt tones.\r\n\r\n"Aggravation, eh?" I grinned like an idiot. 

=== Chunk 12 ===
"Well, well! 

=== Chunk 13 ===
I\'ll bet he\'s\r\ngood at it. But let\'s go see him right away."\r\n\r\n"Bill!" Marge signaled me to one side. "Maybe you\'d better not try to\r\nsee Elmer," she whispered. "I mean, if he can build a thing like this in\r\nhis garage, maybe he _can_ build a disintegrator or a paralysis ray or\r\nsomething. There\'s no use taking chances."\r\n\r\n"You read too many comics," I laughed it off. "He\'s only a kid, isn\'t\r\nhe? What do you think he is? A superman?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," Marge said flatly.\r\n\r\n"Look, Marge!" I said in feverish excitement. 

=== Chunk 14 ===
"I\'ve got to talk to\r\nElmer! I\'ve got to get the rights to that TV color lens and this\r\nelectricity interruptor and anything else he may have developed!"\r\n\r\nMarge kept trying to protest, but I simply grabbed her and Doreen and\r\nhustled them out to my car. Doreen lived in a wooded, hilly section a\r\nlittle north of White Plains. I made it in ten minutes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMarge had said Elmer worked in the garage. I kept going up the driveway,\r\nswung sharp around the big house--and slammed on the brakes.\r\n\r\nMarge screamed.\r\n\r\nWe skidded to a stop with our front end hanging over what looked like a\r\nbomb crater in the middle of the driveway.\r\n\r\nI swallowed my heart down again, while I backed away fast.\r\n\r\nWe had almost plunged into a hole forty feet across and twenty feet deep\r\nin the middle. The hole was perfectly round, like a half section of a\r\ngrapefruit.\r\n\r\n"What\'s this?" I asked. "Where\'s the garage?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s where the garage should be." Marge looked dazed. "But it\'s\r\ngone!"\r\n\r\nI took another look at that hole scooped out with geometrical precision,\r\nand turned to Doreen. "What did you say Elmer was working on?"\r\n\r\n"Agg--" she sobbed, "agg--agg--aggravation." She began to bawl in\r\nearnest. "Now he\'s gone. He\'s mad. He won\'t ever come back, I betcha."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a fact," I muttered. "He may not have been mad, but he certainly\r\nwas aggravated. Marge, listen! This is a mystery. We\'ve just got to let\r\nit stay a mystery. We don\'t know anything, understand? The cops will\r\nfinally decide Elmer blew himself up, and we\'ll leave it at that. One\r\nthing I\'m pretty sure about--he\'s not coming back."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo that\'s how it was. Tom Kennedy keeps trying and trying to put Elmer\'s\r\nunhappen genii back together again. And every time he fails he takes it\r\nout on me because I didn\'t get to Elmer sooner. But you can see\r\nperfectly well he\'s way off base, trying to make out I could have done a\r\nthing to prevent what happened.\r\n\r\nIs it my fault if the dumb kid didn\'t know enough to take the proper\r\nprecautions when he decided to develop anti-gravitation--and got shot\r\noff, garage and all, someplace into outer space?\r\n\r\nWhat do they teach kids nowadays, anyway?\r\n\r\n                                                       --ROBERT ARTHUR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Galaxy Science Fiction_ May 1955.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.
