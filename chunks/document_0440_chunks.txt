And despite\r\nthe heavy knot in my stomach. I felt strangely empty.\r\n\r\nI had never been able to sort out my reactions to an Execution. The\r\natmosphere of careful boredom, the strictly business-as-usual air\r\nfailed to dull my senses as it did for the others. I could always\r\n_taste_ the ozone in the air, mixed with the taste of fear--whether\r\nmine, or that of the Condemned, I never knew. My nostrils always gave\r\nan involuntary twitch at the confined odors and I felt an almost\r\nclaustrophic fear at being packed into the Arena with the other nine\r\nhundred ninety-nine Citizens on Execution Duty.\r\n\r\nI had been expecting my notice for several months before it finally\r\ncame. I hadn\'t served Execution Duty for nearly two years. Usually it\r\nhad figured out to every fourteen months or so on rotation, so I\'d\r\nbeen ready for it. A little apprehensive--I always am--but ready.\r\n\r\nAt 9:00 in the morning, still only half awake (I\'d purposely slept\r\nuntil the last minute), vaguely trying to remember the dream I\'d had,\r\nI waited in front of the Arena for the ordeal to begin. The dream had\r\nbeen something about a knife, an operation. But I couldn\'t remember\r\nwhether I\'d been the doctor or the patient.\r\n\r\nOur times of arrival had been staggered in our notices, so that a long\r\nqueue wouldn\'t tie up traffic, but as usual the checkers were slow, and\r\nwe were backed up a bit.\r\n\r\nI didn\'t like waiting. Somehow I\'ve always felt more exposed on the\r\nstreets, although the brain-scanners must be more plentiful in an Arena\r\nthan almost anywhere else. It\'s only logical that they should be. The\r\nscanners are set up to detect unusual patterns of stress in our brain\r\nwaves as we pass close to them, and thus to pick out as quickly as\r\npossible those with incipient or developing neuroses or psychoses--the\r\npotential deviates. And where else would such an aberration be as\r\nlikely to come out as in the Arena?\r\n\r\nI had moved to the front of the short line. I flashed my notification\r\nof duty to the checker, and was waved on in. I found my proper seat on\r\nthe aisle in the "T" section. It was a relief to sink into its plush\r\ndepths and look the Arena over.\r\n\r\nOnce this had been a first-run Broadway theater--first a place where\r\ngreat plays were shown, and then later the more degenerate motion\r\npictures. Those had been times of vicarious escape from reality--times\r\nwhen the populace ruled, and yet the masses hid their eyes from the\r\nworld. Many things had changed since then, with the coming of regulated\r\nsanity and the achievement of world peace. Gone now were the black arts\r\nof forgetfulness, those media which practiced the enticement of the\r\nCitizen into irresponsible escape. Now this crowded theater was only\r\na reminder. And a place of execution for those who would have sought\r\nescape here.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPerhaps thirty people were sitting on the floor of the Arena, where\r\nonce there had been a stage. They sat quietly in chairs not so\r\ndifferent from mine, strapped for the moment into a kind of passive\r\nconformity. I looked at them with interest. Strangeness has as much\r\nattraction as the familiar at times. As usual, most of them were\r\nyoung--from about ten to the early twenties. But at whatever age,\r\nthey were rebels. They were potential enemies of society. Criminals.\r\nProbably some of them hadn\'t yet realized it. But they were on the\r\nverge of anti-social insanity, and the brain-scanners had singled them\r\nout.\r\n\r\nThey were so young.... How long does it take a boy to become neurotic,\r\npsychotic, dangerous?\r\n\r\nA flurry of movement at the gates caught my eye. Apparently at least\r\none of them was a full-fledged Rebel. He struggled furiously, and the\r\nthree proctors were having an awkward time carrying him into the Arena\r\nwithout hurting him.\r\n\r\nThen, as they moved into the floodlights, I saw with a faint shock that\r\nit was a girl.\r\n\r\nShe was dressed in man\'s clothing, but betrayed by her neurotic and\r\nunsanitary long hair.\r\n\r\nLong, blonde hair. For a moment I forgot where I was, and allowed\r\nmyself to revel in this nearly forbidden sight. The soft waves fell\r\nhalfway down her neck, disarrayed now. The floodlights shined on it, a\r\nstrangely gentle mockery of sunlight. Something within me stirred, and\r\nI almost remembered....\r\n\r\nThen they were strapping her into one of the chairs, carefully pulling\r\nthe soft leather straps with their attached metal electrodes around\r\nher, pinioning her. One set joined her arms to the armrests, another\r\nher legs to the specially devised footrests. Her tunic was opened, and\r\na third set was passed around her chest, the metal plate fastened just\r\nunder her left breast.\r\n\r\nAnd then she was alone.\r\n\r\nI stared at her, drawn at first to her hair, and then, as my vision\r\nfocused across the distance, to her eyes.\r\n\r\nStrange eyes; light blue irises, surrounded by a ring of dark blue, and\r\nflecked with gold. They were shining. She had been crying. Her eyes\r\nseemed to melt, like a pool of clear water growing deeper; I could\r\nalmost see into them, into the darkness beneath. I was no longer aware\r\nof the chair in which I sat ... only of her, alone before me, so close.\r\n\r\nHer eyes widened for just an instant when she recognized me.\r\n\r\n"_Bob._"\r\n\r\n"_Hello, Rosebud._"\r\n\r\n"_I knew you\'d be here. I knew._"\r\n\r\n"_It\'s been a long time.... I think I was trying to forget._"\r\n\r\n"_Don\'t,_" she said. "_Don\'t ever forget._"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSun drenched me, and I was rocked back into time.\r\n\r\n"Hey, you pushed me!" I shouted at her.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said a faint voice, and then, "I\'m sorry," the little\r\ngolden-haired girl said.\r\n\r\nI sat up. Mother was going to be mad at me again, I knew. I wiped the\r\nseat of my pants with my hand, and then stared at the muddy hand with\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n"Look," I said to her, and showed her my hand. When she stepped forward\r\nto look closely at it, I pushed it at her, and smeared mud onto her\r\nface. Then I laughed....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy laughter faded, blending with hers ... and then ... and then we were\r\nno longer standing separately in the sun.\r\n\r\nIt was a dark night, the air fresh and cool to my skin, and the leaves\r\nof the trees which stretched over us rustled with a faint wind.\r\n\r\nI laughed again, a soft girlish sound that brought discomfort to the\r\nboy\'s face before me.\r\n\r\n"Your mother says. Your father says. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Don\'t you ever say anything for\r\nyourself, Bob?"\r\n\r\n"Look, Rosalie, I\'m sorry. Maybe I just don\'t think the way you do. My\r\nfather says sex at our age is just another escape from reality. You\'ve\r\ngot to face yourself as an adult first. He--"\r\n\r\n"Your father is a bigger nincompoop than you are!" I shouted at him. "I\r\nthought you said you loved me. I thought you had some _feelings_ buried\r\nunder that so-called rational mind of yours! Or does your father say\r\nyou\'re too young to _love_ somebody?"\r\n\r\nHe tried to say something, but I was right. He pressed his lips\r\ntogether and looked away. I was almost enjoying it now; with deliberate\r\ncoolness I buttoned up my tunic, feeling the soft fibers on my skin.\r\n\r\n"How long does it take to love somebody?" I said, but my voice was\r\nbeginning to tremble. I turned away from his still figure in the night,\r\nand began the slow walk back along the path to the house. Tears stung\r\nmy eyes, and spilled onto my cheeks; I started to run through the dark.\r\n\r\nI slammed the door when I ran in, and went directly to my room. At\r\none end of it was a small studio, where an easel was lit coldly by\r\na fluorescent light. Almost blindly I began beating my fists on the\r\nstill-wet canvas, blurring and then ripping the nearly finished\r\nportrait of a young man.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI was crying quietly when the low, calm voice stopped me on the street.\r\n\r\n"Just a moment, Miss."\r\n\r\nI felt the sudden skip in my heart which signaled danger, and when I\r\nturned I saw the light green uniform of a proctor in the vague street\r\nlight. My eyes were still blurred with tears. I couldn\'t make out his\r\nface.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry, but I\'ll have to ask you a few questions."\r\n\r\nShielding my face from the light, I tried to make my voice calm. I\r\nhoped my homesick tears were hidden, that my cheeks wouldn\'t glisten in\r\nthe light. I wanted very badly for him not to see I had been crying.\r\n\r\n"Yes?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll have to know why you\'re out on the streets at this time of the\r\nmorning," the proctor said. "There\'s a curfew, you know. Unless you can\r\nshow cause...."\r\n\r\nOh God; I had completely forgotten the city\'s curfew!\r\n\r\n"I--I\'m sorry, Officer. I\'m new to the city and I didn\'t realize...."\r\n\r\n"You\'re transient? Where are you staying?"\r\n\r\n"The Statler Dormitory for Women," I answered meekly.\r\n\r\n"And why are you out at this hour, so far from the dorm? That\'s down\r\nnear 34th Street, almost thirty blocks south."\r\n\r\n"I know. I couldn\'t sleep--" His eyes narrowed at that; had I made a\r\nmistake? I plunged on: "--and I wanted to see Central Park. I didn\'t\r\nrealize there was any harm...."\r\n\r\n"I guess not this time, Miss, but you\'d better get back to your dorm.\r\nTake this pass." He scribbled a few words on a pad and then detached a\r\nslip of green paper for me. "You can take a train down to 34th Street.\r\nNow."\r\n\r\n"I\'d just as soon walk, sir."\r\n\r\nHe stared at me for a moment and then I turned and started for the\r\nnearest subway entrance.\r\n\r\nIt had been horrible, those first few days in the Dorm. I\'d\r\nnever dreamed that a sane society could be so ... not cruel, but\r\n_unthinking_. Back home in Woodstock we were all supposed to be sane\r\ntoo, but neither Father nor Mother had ever forced any rigid rules on\r\nme. They had let me roam the woods, scuffing the dry leaves in autumn,\r\ndrinking water from the creeks in my cupped hands. They hadn\'t objected\r\nwhen I was gone for hours. Usually I was just sitting on a log and\r\nstaring into the sky, and what harm was there in that?\r\n\r\nThey had encouraged my painting. "It\'s supposed to be a sign of\r\nescapism," Dad said, "but there are a lot worse ways of escaping." He\r\nmade an easel for me, and I used tubes of house-paint tint-colors and\r\nstretched canvas and burlap over frames Dad made. He even gave me a\r\nbook of reproductions of the Old Masters that he\'d saved.\r\n\r\nLife in Woodstock had been pleasant for me, I realized now, even if\r\nit had often seemed lonely. I couldn\'t have told the proctor that I\'d\r\nreally woken up from a dream about Bob before I\'d gone out walking.\r\nI\'d seen Bob\'s face so clearly, standing in the night, unable to say\r\nanything to me. Suddenly it had seemed that my voice was stopped too,\r\nand I\'d woken up gasping....\r\n\r\nI boarded a local train, not caring that an express would be much\r\nfaster, and began the trip back to my cubicle at the Statler Dorm. If\r\nonly they hadn\'t taken my parents....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI had succeeded in setting up a makeshift easel in my room at the Dorm,\r\nand was working on a painting, wearing some of Dad\'s old clothes, when\r\nthe proctors broke in.\r\n\r\nOne of them pointed a small indicator at me, glanced at it and nodded.\r\n\r\n"She\'s the one. Instability and escapism. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
And look at the kind of\r\nclothes she wears."\r\n\r\n"What are you doing?" 

=== Chunk 5 ===
I whispered. This was how they\'d taken my parents!\r\n\r\n"You\'re under detention as a criminal against society. Miss," one of\r\nthe proctors said. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
"We\'re all sorry."\r\n\r\nAnother one stepped forward and held out a hand to me as one might a\r\nchild. "Come along now."\r\n\r\n"_No!_" I backed away from them, and when they trapped me in the corner\r\nI kicked and screamed at them. "Leave me alone, leave me alone! You\'re\r\nkillers!" One of them grabbed me and held me around my waist, my arms\r\npinned to my sides.\r\n\r\n"We\'re not killers, Miss," he said, and his voice was incredibly calm.\r\n"We have nothing to do with it."\r\n\r\nI twisted free and struck at him, tearing skin from his face with my\r\nnails. "_Weren\'t my parents enough?_"\r\n\r\nOne of them pointed another device at me, and I blacked out.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen I came to, I was being carried by three proctors through a door\r\nand down a hall. My head was fuzzy and throbbing. I caught a glimpse\r\nof a stenciled sign in the corridor, lettered neatly over an arrow\r\npointing in the direction we were going. The words leaped out at me:\r\n_Execution Arena Floor_.\r\n\r\nOne of the proctors saw that I was conscious and looked down at me\r\npleasantly. "No sense struggling now," he said. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
"It\'ll be over soon."\r\n\r\nI stared back at him for a moment, not understanding. But then the\r\nkindness in his face became clear. He pitied me! The proctors were\r\ncarrying me as gently as possible, as though I were a dog with a broken\r\nleg.\r\n\r\nI felt incredibly sad, and so tired that I was sure I must suddenly\r\nweigh twice as much. But they carried me through the door and out onto\r\nthe floor of the Arena, and there were a thousand people up in the dark\r\nwaiting for me. There were floodlights on the chairs where the others\r\nof the Condemned were strapped. They sat quietly, dully, as though they\r\nwere the Executioners and the people above were waiting for _them_ to\r\npress the buttons.\r\n\r\nBut it was insane! How could they take it so calmly----were they dead\r\nalready? Did they _want_ to die?\r\n\r\nOr was I really insane? Where _was_ the sanity in this Arena?\r\n\r\nI couldn\'t lie still while they carried me to that chair. I was\r\nfrightened. I was terrified! They were all so silent, so calm, so\r\nkindly. As though nothing at all were happening--nothing at all!\r\n\r\nI struggled, trying to fight my way free. I kicked and screamed; I\r\nhad to make some noise in that black silence. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
But they held me, and\r\nstrapped me into the chair. And still there was no sound in the Arena.\r\n\r\nI felt a shock, a tension, and I looked up.\r\n\r\nThere, in the audience, sitting before his little panel with the blue\r\nlight and the red Executioner\'s button, was a young man staring at me.\r\n\r\nI could feel his stare, like a cool hand touching me. It drew me up,\r\ninto the dimness....\r\n\r\nI felt my eyes widen with recognition.\r\n\r\n"_Bob_," I said.\r\n\r\nHis reply sounded deep inside my mind, "_Hello, Rosebud._"\r\n\r\n"_I knew you\'d be here_," I said, and then I drew him close to me.\r\n\r\n"_It\'s been a long time._"\r\n\r\n"_Don\'t ever forget_," I said, and opened myself to him at last.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe lights in the Arena dimmed, rose, dimmed again. The first signal\r\nI pressed against the straps, but they were firm and unmoving. Yet\r\nI--we--leaned forward, and watched the panel with its blue light. Our\r\nstomach was knotted like tight leather cords.\r\n\r\nThe blue light flashed. I reached out a hand to the small red button.\r\nThe straps bit into our flesh. The panel was dim, ghostly beneath the\r\nglaring lights from the dark above.\r\n\r\nA thousand hands touched a thousand red buttons.\r\n\r\nOne of them was the first to touch the button, the first to complete\r\nthe circuit. No one knew who he was. No one even knew if every button\r\nwas connected, but someone touched a button and somewhere the circuit\r\nwas completed.\r\n\r\n_Shock!_ Pain jerked our body rigid! We _screamed_; our skin blistered\r\nas hair singed and fell away. And there was a greater shock, a pain\r\nsomewhere else, as our images cleaved and I fell away from her. I\r\nreached out my hand to her, and almost felt her touch ... but my hand\r\nwas on the button, and she was slumped in her chair on the floor of the\r\nArena.\r\n\r\nI jerked my hand away from the button as though it were hot\r\nelectricity. My whole body was moist with perspiration.\r\n\r\nI stared about me, suddenly and deeply frightened. Which of us had\r\nscreamed? I\'d felt it surging up in me, felt it tearing at my throat,\r\nbursting from my mouth--but next to me the others were unconcernedly\r\nwaiting for me to rise from my seat so that we could file in an\r\norderly fashion from our places in the Arena. They had noticed nothing.\r\n\r\nWhen I stood up my legs were trembling. I could still feel where the\r\nleather straps had bitten into them. I stepped carefully up the stairs\r\nand went out into the morning sunshine. Though the floodlights had been\r\nbright in the Arena, still the sunlight hurt my eyes. I paused at the\r\ndoor, and looked at my ring-watch. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
It was nine-thirty. Only half an\r\nhour had passed.\r\n\r\nHow long does it take to destroy a few spoiled lives?\r\n\r\nIt was over. I forced my breathing into a more normal rate and stepped\r\nonto the sidewalk. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
Don\'t think about it, I told myself. After all, it\r\nhad been years earlier that I had really lost her....\r\n\r\nI had almost made it to the corner when I felt the tap on my shoulder,\r\nbegan to turn, saw the green-sleeved arm extending toward me a familiar\r\nblack indicator, and heard the proctor say:\r\n\r\n"This is the one. Definite case: schizoid condition, latent telepath."\r\n\r\n"We\'re all sorry," said another of them.\r\n\r\nAnd they led me away to face it again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s I, Executioner, by Ted White and Terry Carr\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
