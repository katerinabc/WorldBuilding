]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the two Geno-Doctors were gone, Miryam took the red capsule from\r\nunder the base of the bedlamp and slipped it between her dry lips.\r\n\r\nReason told her to swallow the capsule quickly, but instead she held it\r\nunder her tongue, clinging, against her will, to the last few moments\r\nof life.\r\n\r\nShe knew she was being weak, that she was still seeking hope where\r\nthere was no hope, and she prayed to the ancient God of the Ghetto that\r\nthe gelatin coating would dissolve quickly.\r\n\r\nPain interrupted the prayer, spreading like slow fire from deep within\r\nher young body, where the unwanted child of Genetics Center stirred so\r\nrestlessly, so impatient to be born.\r\n\r\nThe white walls of her Center room blurred in and out of focus. Shadows\r\nmerged together in brief, uncertain patterns. Lights flickered where\r\nthere were no lights, and the darkness was so intense it had a glare of\r\nits own.\r\n\r\nAt the worst of the pain cycle, Miryam bit down on her under lip until\r\nthe flesh showed as white as her teeth. She fought off temptation to\r\ncrunch the capsule and put an end to all pain, all fear.\r\n\r\nNo, she would not go that way. She would go in a moment of blinding\r\nclarity, knowing why, savoring the last bitter sweet second of her\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\nWith a subconscious gesture of femininity, Miryam brushed the dark,\r\ndamp hair from her forehead, and wiped the perspiration from her lips.\r\n\r\n"Pretty little thing," one of the Geno-Service agents had called her,\r\nwhen she was arrested last fall in the Warsaw suburb where she had\r\ntaught nursery school since escaping from the Ghetto.\r\n\r\n"Doesn\'t look a bit like one of her kind," another agent had said,\r\nputting his hand under her chin and turning her face to the glare of\r\nhis flashlight. "No wonder she fooled the Psycho and Chemico squads....\r\nLucky for us!

=== Chunk 3 ===
"\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter, little one?" the first agent had spoken again.\r\n"Didn\'t you know we were coming? I thought all of you people were\r\nsupposed to be telepaths.... Or doesn\'t it work when you\'re asleep?"\r\n\r\nHe flipped the covers off her trembling body and whistled.\r\n\r\n"Hands off!" the Geno-Sergeant had warned sharply. "She\'s for Center!"\r\n\r\nNow the capsule under her tongue was moist and soft. Time fled on\r\nswift, fluttering wings. Soon the horror would be done.\r\n\r\nBut the stubborn spark still glowed, and Miryam allowed her mind to\r\ndrift down the long, shining corridor to the room where the younger of\r\nthe two Geno-Doctors was changing into a white coat. The older man, who\r\nwore the gold trefoil of Geno-Sar on his collar, tilted back in his\r\nchair.\r\n\r\n"She should be just about due," he said cheerfully.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Sir," replied the young doctor, sounding the proper note of\r\ndeference for a man who communed daily with the political elite.\r\n\r\n"What do you think of her?"\r\n\r\n"Well, Sir, frankly--I was surprised--" The young doctor twisted\r\nmuscular arms to button the back of his jacket. He had but recently\r\ncome from the Genetics Sanitarium on the Black Sea, and his face was\r\ntanned deep brown. "From reading the weekly reports of your staff, I\r\ndidn\'t know she was that--that young--"\r\n\r\nMiryam trembled with a hope she dared not recognize, but it was crushed\r\nout of her by the Geno-Sar\'s booming voice.\r\n\r\n"Not only one of the youngest--but one of the very best specimens we\'ve\r\nhad to work with at Center! You read her psi rating?

=== Chunk 4 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Sir. Seventy-two point four, wasn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Seventy-two point six! Absolutely phenomenal! Closest thing to a pure\r\ntelepath our agents have ever turned up for us! This could be a big\r\nnight for Center, my boy.... A big night!"\r\n\r\nThe young doctor shook his head to clear away the lingering image of a\r\ntragic, lovely face against a tear-stained pillow. Miryam was startled\r\nto find this image in his mind, and her pulse leaped again.\r\n\r\nIn a carefully professional tone, the young doctor asked:\r\n\r\n"What was her rating after insemination? Did the emotional shock...?

=== Chunk 5 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Not at all! Oh, naturally, she was uncooperative in the tests, but\r\npentathol and our cross-references gave us a true picture!"\r\n\r\n"And the spermatozoa?

=== Chunk 6 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Best we could get! Refrigerated about thirty years ago from a specimen\r\nthat tested forty-seven point eight."\r\n\r\nThe Geno-Sar paused, and because a comment was obviously in order, the\r\nyoung doctor said:\r\n\r\n"This certainly could be a big night for Center!"\r\n\r\nThe Geno-Sar snapped his cigarette lighter with an expansive flourish.\r\n\r\n"All the sciences have been taking a crack at psi--ever since the last\r\nPolitbureau directive gave it number one priority. You should have\r\nheard the talk at Sar-Bureau meeting this afternoon! The Math-Sar\r\nactually laughed at Genetics ... told us to stick to our white mice!"\r\n\r\nThe young doctor made a polite cluck of disapproval.\r\n\r\n"Those stupid mathematicians could learn something of heredity from\r\ntheir own ancients," the Geno-Sar continued, growing heated. "Think of\r\nLiebnitz, gifted at 14--Galois, a genius before he was 21!"\r\n\r\nThe Geno-Sar recovered his temper, and winked.\r\n\r\n"Of course, I didn\'t say that at the meeting--the Bureau chief is very\r\npartial to Math--but I did remind them, most pointedly, of the known\r\ndata on inherited sensory differences between individuals. And you\r\nshould have seen the squirming! Especially when I got into the taste\r\nstudies and the phenyl-thio-carbamide tests! Then, when I told of\r\nGenetics research on sense of time--sense of direction--sensitivity to\r\npain, sound and smells--Well, the Chief was hanging on my every word!\r\nThe Psycho-Sar became desperate to the point of rashness, and he jibed\r\nat me about our ancient master, Profim Lysenko." The Geno-Sar\'s head\r\ninclined slightly as he pronounced the name. "But the Chief himself\r\ngave the correct answer! He quoted from a Bureau directive which stated\r\nclearly that sensory characteristics, like any others, could well have\r\nbeen acquired in the first place, and then passed on through heredity!\r\nOh, I tell you, it was a heart-warming afternoon!"\r\n\r\nThe younger man had been paying him only half attention.\r\n\r\n"It\'s strange we should find some cases of psi among her people," he\r\nmused. "When I was at the University I always meant to study something\r\nabout the--" he hesitated and searched for the approved term, "--the\r\nspecimen races, but I never had time...."\r\n\r\nFor an instant the Geno-Sar\'s steel-blue eyes narrowed, and Miryam was\r\nshocked to find him appraising the young man for possible heresy. She\r\nhad always regarded the scientific mind as something remote, cold, but\r\nnever as something that could commit a heresy.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Geno-Sar decided to table the subject.\r\n\r\n"Of course you didn\'t!" he boomed. "You couldn\'t have made such a\r\nsplendid record without total specialization! Each to his own, that\'s\r\nhow science has prospered under the benevolence of our party!" He\r\nglanced up at the clock. "Well, aren\'t we just about ready for this\r\ndelivery?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMiryam drew back her mind. What a fool she was to go on seeking!\r\n\r\nThe child resumed its inexorable turning within her swollen body,\r\nand she knew she could never give to the world a life conceived so\r\nterribly, so coldly, without love or passion or tenderness.\r\n\r\nEven in these final moments, with the gelatin melting under her tongue,\r\nMiryam shuddered with the remembered anguish of struggling up from the\r\ndepths of anaesthesia to find herself bearing the seed of a child, from\r\na faceless man who had died long ago.\r\n\r\nOften, during the carefully guarded months of pregnancy, she had\r\nwondered about that man, who he had been, how his talent had compared\r\nwith hers.\r\n\r\nMiryam knew little about genetics, or any other science. The scientific\r\nmind had always frightened her, and she had feared to explore it.\r\nBut she knew there was no truth to the folklore that psi was a\r\ncharacteristic of her people. She knew of only a few cases outside\r\nher own family, although within her family it seemed to have been a\r\ncharacteristic that had recurred frequently for many generations. Her\r\nfather had cautioned her about selecting a husband, and pleaded with\r\nher not to flee the Ghetto.\r\n\r\nFor the past three days, since the nurse had momentarily left the\r\ncabinet at the end of the corridor unlocked and unguarded, Miryam had\r\nknown that she need not be concerned about the success or failure of\r\nthis terrible experiment. From the nurse\'s mind she had plucked the\r\nessential facts about the potency of the red capsule. This knowledge,\r\nfor all its loneliness, had been something to cherish, to press to her\r\nfull breasts, as she would never hold that child of horror.\r\n\r\nTears filled her eyes, squeezed in droplets between the closed lids.\r\nTears because she was so alone. Tears of unbearable sadness and pity,\r\nfor her people, for her youth and her young body, for the warmth that\r\nwould be eternally cold, for the unnatural child that squirmed and\r\nturned, and would never cry.\r\n\r\nIn a last forlorn gesture, in a final seeking before the darkness\r\nclosed, Miryam let her mind stray out of the white room, out of the\r\nmarble magnificence of Center. She let her thoughts escape on the soft\r\nbreeze of the early summer evening.\r\n\r\nHow beautiful it was, even here in the city, amid the science buildings\r\nthat formed bright islands of light around the minarets and vaulted\r\ndomes of Government Square.\r\n\r\nEven these awesome buildings were lovely in the purple dusk. Their\r\nwindows were like scattered emeralds of light.\r\n\r\nHow could there be so much beauty without compassion? So much knowledge\r\nwithout understanding? So much human genius without humanity?\r\n\r\nAnd what a battering of thoughts in the mild air around the centers of\r\nscience! What a discordance! What a tumult of theories, each of them\r\nnurtured within its own walls by the zealous Sars.\r\n\r\nThere were the Departments of Chemistry and Physics. There was the\r\nglass-walled tower of Astronomy! There was the Institute of Psychology,\r\nwith all its many bureaus. And the new Electronics Building, alabaster\r\neven in the dusk.\r\n\r\nThey were all there, extending in stately splendor along the main\r\navenues, and along the park, where the gossamer mist was rising.\r\n\r\nHow intolerant were the thoughts they radiated! How sure!\r\n\r\nElectronics said: "Quite obviously the answer to psi is in the\r\nelectrical currents of the brain. Our newest electro-encephalograph has\r\ndemonstrated...."\r\n\r\nChemistry said: "Solution to psi inevitably will be found in the\r\nchemical balance of the cells...."\r\n\r\nParapsychology said: "We must continue to ignore those who insist upon\r\nattributing physical properties to a non-physical characteristic...."\r\n\r\nAnd underneath this learned babble, Miryam heard the moth-like\r\nwhispering of her own people, starving in the Ghetto, or hidden\r\nthroughout the city, disguised, furtive, tense.\r\n\r\nHer mind came close to Government Square, and she cringed, as she\r\nhad cringed all her young life. The somatics were unbearable. Hatred\r\nand fear, blind prejudice, jealousy, cunning, ceaseless intrigue and\r\nplotting, setting Sar against Sar, using the genius of each science,\r\ndividing and ruling.\r\n\r\nNo, there was nothing left. No hope, no promise. This was the end of\r\ntime. This was the night of the world.\r\n\r\nWithdrawing again, retreating into itself, Miryam\'s mind brushed the\r\nfragment of a thought. It was a half-formed thought, more a groping,\r\nmore a question, than an idea. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
It was delicate, fragile, a wraith and a\r\nwisp. But it came to her as clear as the note from a silver bell.\r\n\r\nStartled, she hesitated in her withdrawal, and perceived the young\r\nGeno-Doctor in the corridor near her room. He had paused by the\r\ncasement window, and was staring out at the twinkling islands of light\r\naround Government Square.\r\n\r\nAnd as his gaze wandered moodily from Tech, to Psycho, to Chemico, to\r\nall the incandescent, isolated centers of genius, the idle speculation\r\nhad formed.\r\n\r\n"Wouldn\'t it be an unusual view if all those bright islands were\r\nconnected by strings of light...?"\r\n\r\nOnce formed, the speculation had fanned the ember of a thought:\r\n\r\n"Wonder if psi will build those strings of lights?"\r\n\r\nThen the young doctor turned almost guiltily from the window to\r\nmeet the Geno-Sar coming down the corridor. And he said with crisp\r\nefficiency,\r\n\r\n"I\'ll check out 12-A for delivery."\r\n\r\n"Good boy! I\'ll go on up and check the staff...." The Geno-Sar rubbed\r\nhis hands together, and walked off, repeating nervously, "Two psi\r\ncharacteristics must be the answer--two psi--"\r\n\r\n"Maybe they are," the young doctor murmured softly. "Maybe they are...."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDelivery, Miryam thought. The life within her throbbed and prodded.\r\nThere was an ebbing of pain for a moment, and in that moment she saw\r\nwith the blinding clarity she had sought that this child of hers might\r\nbring new hope to the world. That psi ability might be the answer to\r\nmany things for the race of mankind. What did it matter that it was\r\nconceived without love and emotion. What did it matter that she was\r\nbeing used as an experiment ... if this child within her could fulfill\r\nthe promise.\r\n\r\nMiryam spat the soft capsule between her quivering lips. She watched it\r\nroll and bounce across the polished tile floor, toward the door.\r\n\r\nPain returned, and its fire was warm. There were no shadows on the\r\nwall. Pain returned, and it had purpose and promise. Wonderingly, she\r\nbeheld the concept that science, too, lived with fear, each science in\r\nits own Ghetto. And if the young doctor was right, if psi....\r\n\r\nAs the doctor stepped into the room, he bent over and picked up the\r\nred capsule. His thumb and forefinger felt the warmth, the moisture,\r\nand he looked long and thoughtfully into Miryam\'s dark, glowing eyes.\r\n\r\nHis fingers shook as he wrapped the capsule in a piece of tissue and\r\ndropped it into the pocket of his white jacket. He picked up the chart\r\nfrom the foot of the bed.\r\n\r\n"Miryam--" His voice was not under complete control, and he began\r\nagain, with an effort at lightness. "Miryam--that\'s a strange name.\r\nWhat does it mean?"\r\n\r\n"It is an ancient spelling," she whispered, her eyes deep and dark,\r\nfilled with pain and wonder. "You may find it easier to call me--Mary."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
