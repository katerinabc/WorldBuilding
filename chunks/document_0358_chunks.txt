BENTLEY\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _Illustrated by Virgil Finlay_\r\n\r\n\r\n     _The black dwarf sun sent its assassin on a mission which\r\n      was calculated to erase the threat to its existence. But\r\n      prophesies run in strange patterns and, sometimes, an act of\r\n      evasion becomes an act of fulfillment...._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ruler of a planet with a black dwarf sun had called a meeting of\r\nthe council. It was some time before they were assembled, and he\r\nwaited patiently without thought.\r\n\r\nWhen the patchwork of mentalities was complete he allowed the\r\nconclusions of the prognosticator to occupy his mind. A wall of\r\nunanimous incredulity sprang up. The statement was that when the\r\ninhabitants of a distant planet achieved space flight they would come\r\nto this planet, and use a weapon invented by an individual to destroy\r\nit. The prognosticator could not lie, and soon the facade dissolved\r\ninto individual reactions as acceptance became general. Anger, fear,\r\nresignation, and greedy little thoughts of self-aggrandizement. Those\r\nthoughts were replaced by a quiescent, questioning receptivity. The\r\nquestioning grew out of proportion, became hysterical, assumed the\r\npanic shape. Self-preservation demanding that there be a solution.\r\nMinor prophecies had been evaded before. Details of the individual had\r\nbeen supplied, could not something be done?\r\n\r\nThe Assassin was summoned.\r\n\r\nThe pattern of Dr. Simon Cartwright\'s encephalic emanations, and the\r\napproximate position of the center of these emanations were impressed\r\non its mind. And in a strangely bulbous ship it plunged outward from\r\nthat eternally dark and silent planet towards Earth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA man was walking along a road. A high road. A silent, dark road.\r\nBelow him on both sides of the road flat marshland swept away, and a\r\nlittle wind caressed him with chill fingers. His tiny world of road\r\nbeneath him, darkness around him, sky above him, contained only the\r\nsound of his footsteps--and one other. A regular, liquid sound. He\r\nthought it was a sound from the marsh. He listened to it, and wondered\r\nhow long it had been with him. It was close behind him on the road. He\r\nstopped, turned round in small curiosity, and bellowed in great\r\nhorror. He threw up his hands against an immense bulk, a frog-like\r\nshape, a lurching, flowing movement. Then it was upon him, and stilled\r\nhis futile writhings, and passed over him, and left him dead.\r\n\r\nThe Assassin continued along the road. It was aware that it had\r\nkilled, but it could not contemplate the fact. It possessed all the\r\nmental powers of its race, but its conditioning had focused them in\r\none direction, the assassination of Dr. Cartwright. It could consider\r\nonly those factors which had a direct relation to that purpose.\r\n\r\nDaylight was one of those factors.\r\n\r\nIt was not aware of the passage of time, but when the sensitive patch\r\non its back began to contract it left the road and went to the marsh.\r\nThere it burrowed into the slime until green-flecked water closed over\r\nit. And deeper until a depth of mud protected it from the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Cartwright groaned and sat up in bed. He silenced the ringing\r\ntelephone by putting the receiver to his ear.\r\n\r\n"Do you know what time it is?" he asked, aggrieved.\r\n\r\n"Hello? Doctor Cartwright? This is the police."\r\n\r\n"It is half-past seven," continued Simon. "For me, the middle of the\r\nnight. I am in no fit state to measure a drunk\'s reactions."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry, sir, but there\'s been an accident. On the Waverton\r\nHighway. A man is dead, Inspector Andrews is in charge of the case."\r\n\r\n"Inspector Andrews? Is mayhem suspected? Never mind, I\'ll get down\r\nthere, right away."\r\n\r\nHe put the receiver down and got out of bed. His wife muttered\r\nsomething unintelligible and wrapped his share of the blankets round\r\nher. Simon went downstairs. He made a cup of coffee and drank it while\r\nhe dressed. The engine of his car was cold, but his house was on a\r\nhill and he was able to coast down to the Highway.\r\n\r\nThe road was level and straight, and after a few minutes driving a\r\nlittle tableau came into sight--two cars, a group of uniforms.\r\nInspector Andrews, tall, thin, dyspeptic, greeted him with a limp\r\nhandshake. "Something funny about this," he said. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
"See what you\r\nthink."\r\n\r\nSimon went down on one knee beside the body and began to undo the\r\nclothing. After a time he looked up into the sky. "This is very\r\nstrange," he murmured.\r\n\r\n"I know," grunted Andrews. "Can they take the body now?"\r\n\r\nSimon stood up and nodded. He remained staring out across the marsh\r\nuntil the body had been removed, and the ambulance a distant object.\r\nThen he went and sat in his car. Andrews finished giving instructions\r\nto his Sergeant, and joined him. "I\'ll let you give me breakfast," he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"You\'re very kind," said Simon absently, and released the brake.\r\n\r\n"Any use asking for the cause of death?" asked Andrews.\r\n\r\n"Oh, the cause of death was crushing, but the cause of the cause of\r\ndeath--" Simon shook his head. "There wasn\'t an unbroken bone in his\r\nbody. Could he have been dropped from an airplane?"\r\n\r\nAndrews shook a ponderous head. "He was a bus driver on his way to\r\nwork without an enemy in the world. And I\'ve a feeling his death is\r\ngoing to keep me awake at nights. Anyway, Sergeant Bennet is going\r\nover the area with a magnifying glass. We\'ll put up a pretty good\r\nshow. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Can you suggest anything?"\r\n\r\n"It wasn\'t a car," said Simon carefully. "The skin was unbroken,\r\nexcept from the inside. I can only imagine something like a\r\nrubber-covered steam-roller."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat night the Assassin killed two people.\r\n\r\nWhen it grew dark it heaved itself up out of the slime. A long\r\nbusiness of bodily expansion and contraction. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Two men were on the road\r\nand heard the noise it made.\r\n\r\n"Somethin\' out there."\r\n\r\n"Stray cow, maybe."\r\n\r\nThey stood and peered into the dark, trying to see a familiar shape.\r\nThe Assassin approached them, and was too big for them to see. They\r\nstood in its path and looked for a familiar object in the blackness of\r\nits body. So the instant of apprehension was small, the panic and\r\nexertion soon over. Without pausing the Assassin moved over them and\r\ncontinued on its way.\r\n\r\nA little later Inspector Andrews found them. He was in a radio patrol\r\ncar, and he was moving in the same direction as the Assassin. With him\r\nin the car were three large men carrying automatic rifles. Andrews\r\nstopped the car, and one of the men got out and knelt by the bodies.\r\nAndrews watched him somberly for a moment then reached for the\r\nmicrophone. He spoke to the station sergeant.\r\n\r\n"Inspector Andrews here. Send an ambulance out here, will you, and\r\nphone Doctor Cartwright. Tell him the steam-roller\'s loose again. It\r\nmay be on the road heading his way. Yes, steam-roller. He\'ll\r\nunderstand."\r\n\r\nHe put the microphone down, called to the man on the road. "I\'m\r\nleaving you here, Roberts. There\'s an ambulance on its way. Go back\r\nwith it. Get in Sergeant Bennet\'s car and both of you join us up\r\nahead."\r\n\r\nHe closed the car window and released the brake. The empty road began\r\nto unwind slowly into the area of light ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\nSimon put the receiver down and looked at his wife. She was\r\nconcentrating on a sock by the fire. He went over and kissed the top\r\nof her head. "Goodbye," she said.\r\n\r\n"Listen," he said quietly. "When I\'m gone lock the door behind me and\r\ndon\'t go out. If you hear any funny noises go down to the cellar.\r\nUnderstand?"\r\n\r\nShe was a little frightened. "Honey, what is it?"\r\n\r\nHe smiled. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
"It\'s nothing. Long John Andrews is out hunting. I\'m going\r\nalong in case he shoots himself."\r\n\r\nHe took his shot-gun off the mantle and stuffed his pockets with\r\ncartridges.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll bring you back a rabbit," he said. "So long."\r\n\r\nHe drove down slowly. He was scared, but he was still young enough to\r\nfind it exhilarating. The loaded shot-gun was a great help.\r\n\r\nHe turned on to the highway, and slowed to walking pace. He stared\r\ninto the darkness ahead until his eyes burned, and imagination peopled\r\nhis surroundings with writhing shapes.\r\n\r\nThen he saw it, and the muscles across his chest trembled\r\nconvulsively. Fear clutched his stomach. He slammed his foot down on\r\nthe brake and gaped up at it. It was standing still in the middle of\r\nthe road, a giant, pear shaped body, looking something like a man\r\nkneeling upright. At the front, turned inwards, were a number of\r\narm-like appendages.\r\n\r\nThe shot-gun was ridiculous now, the car made of paper. To get out and\r\nrun was impossible, and he longed to be able to sit still and do\r\nnothing. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
And the seconds dragged by. Time for contemplation built up,\r\nand a strange realization dropped into his seething mind. He sensed\r\nsomething about its attitude. A cringing, a withdrawal. "God," he\r\nwhispered. "It doesn\'t like the light."\r\n\r\nHe might have relaxed then, but it moved. One of its arms unfolded,\r\nswung outward holding something metallic. Simon yelled. He grabbed the\r\nshot-gun, shoved the door catch down, threw his weight sideways. He\r\nlanded on his shoulder and kept on rolling. He reached the other side\r\nof the road, straightened up, and saw the roof of the car fly off with\r\na roar. He fired then, from a crouching position and without taking\r\naim. A lucky shot that hit the end of the weapon arm and shattered it.\r\nThen he ran, and the Assassin followed.\r\n\r\nHe ran in the direction he\'d been heading, and gave himself up to\r\nterror. He was primaeval man fleeing from sabre-tooth. He was living a\r\nnightmare. His brain reeled, air burnt his lungs, and his pounding\r\nheart echoed in his temples. Then he was running into a blaze of\r\nlight, between headlights that enfolded him like a mother\'s arms, and\r\nhe was clinging to a radiator cap. Dimly he heard the crash of high\r\npowered rifles about him. A black figure came into his haven of light,\r\nbegan to loosen his tie.\r\n\r\n"Get out of the light," he gasped. "It doesn\'t like the light."\r\n\r\n"Who invited you?" 

=== Chunk 7 ===
grunted Andrews. He put Simon\'s arm round his neck,\r\nand half carried him round to the side of the car, pushed him into the\r\nfront seat.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be all right in a minute," said Simon.\r\n\r\n"Yeah," said Andrews, and left him.\r\n\r\nAfter a little while the trembling in his limbs began to subside,\r\nbreathing became easier. He leaned forward and watched a strange\r\nbattle. The Assassin was about seventy yards ahead, moving slowly\r\nnearer. Two men stood on the right hand side of the car, pumping\r\nbullets into the grey, indistinct mass. Andrews stood watching with\r\nhis hands in his jacket pockets. Suddenly he said, "All right, let go.\r\nYou\'re only wasting bullets."\r\n\r\nSimon looked at him in alarm. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
"Hey, you\'re not just going to stand\r\nthere. It doesn\'t like the light, but light can\'t kill it."\r\n\r\n"Lie down on the floor," said Andrews dourly, without looking at him.\r\n\r\n"Eh?"\r\n\r\nAndrews ignored him, stepped two paces forward. The Assassin was about\r\ntwenty yards away now, seeming to have to fight against the stream of\r\nlight. Andrews took his hands from his pockets. Simon saw what he was\r\nholding, and dived for the floor. He clasped his hands over the back\r\nof his neck as the night exploded with a gigantic crash.\r\n\r\nWhen his ears had stopped screaming he got up. Andrews, an elbow on\r\nthe window ledge, was watching him expressionlessly.\r\n\r\n"You might have left me something to dissect," complained Simon.\r\n"Somebody\'s got to, you know."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll mop you up a sponge full," said Andrews.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, you won\'t. You and your men stay back here. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
It\'s probably\r\ncrawling with alien bacteria."\r\n\r\nActually, quite a lot of the Assassin was left, but decomposition was\r\nvery rapid. Simon did the best he could with a magnifying glass and a\r\npenknife. He found that the body was almost entirely composed of bone\r\nand flesh in a honey-comb like structure. The bone being highly\r\nflexible, and the cavities filled with grey flesh. Flesh which quickly\r\nliquified and drained away from the bone. There was no blood, and\r\nSimon could find no trace of internal organs.\r\n\r\nWhile he worked two more cars drove up, and gave him a little more\r\nlight, but soon he had to give up. As he walked slowly back a\r\nspotlight sprang suddenly to life, and a pleasant authoritative voice\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n"Will you stay where you are, please, Doctor Cartwright."\r\n\r\nSimon obeyed. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
Hell, he thought wearily. Officialdom has arrived. He\r\nshaded his eyes against the light, but he could see nothing.\r\n\r\n"Who\'s that?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Commanding officer in charge of operations in this emergency. You\'ve\r\nmade an examination?

=== Chunk 11 ===
"\r\n\r\n"As far as I could. There\'s complete decomposition now."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I see." A slight pause, then; "Perhaps I\'d better put you in the\r\npicture. This is armed aggression, Doctor Cartwright. In any language\r\nit says war. 

=== Chunk 12 ===
Do you understand? We\'re at war, now.\r\n\r\n"We found the vessel your friend came in several days ago. It was in\r\nthe sea, twenty miles from here. Its discovery was kept secret because\r\nwe weren\'t sure of its point of origin. Our people are engaged in\r\nfinding the method of propulsion. They say it will give us the ability\r\nto travel in space. They also say that they can find the approximate\r\nposition of its home planet. All that is top priority, of course, but\r\nin the meanwhile we must have an emergency line of defence against\r\nthese things. We want to know how to find them and how to destroy them\r\nwith the least possible expenditure of life and material. You\r\nunderstand?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. I\'ve got an idea about light waves. I fired a shot at it back\r\nthere. The bone structure--"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t tell me," interrupted the voice sharply. "Remember it. You\r\nrealize, Doctor Cartwright, that you are just about the most important\r\nman alive. You know how fast it can move. You have fought it, you\r\nhave examined it. So you can be sure that very good care will be taken\r\nof you."\r\n\r\n"What are you saying?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry, but you must see that you have to go into strict\r\nquarantine now. We dare not risk a plague. After quarantine you will\r\ngo to work with our people. Now will you please get into the car at\r\nthe extreme right, and follow the police."\r\n\r\n"Where am I going?"\r\n\r\n"Please hurry. There is a team of incendiaries waiting to clear the\r\narea."\r\n\r\n"Oh, damnation," sighed The Most Important Man Alive, and walked\r\ntowards the waiting car.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the ruler consulted the prognosticator again, after the\r\nAssassin\'s failure had been recorded, he found that a qualification\r\nhad been added. The prophecy was now being fulfilled. He considered\r\nthis dispassionately. He visualised the complex pattern of implication\r\nalmost with pleasure. Was the machine alive? Certainly it could\r\ncontemplate itself. It had calculated the effect of its existence, and\r\nhad used the knowledge to destroy them. Or had they condemned\r\nthemselves? By losing the ability to question. For the information on\r\nwhich the prophecy was based could have been available to them. Or was\r\nthe machine only obeying a greater Fate? A Decree, stating that any\r\nlife-form that surrendered itself to the dictates of a machine was\r\ndoomed.\r\n\r\nOne thing alone was left to him. A choice. Without haste he began the\r\npreliminaries to thinking himself to death.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s The Honored Prophet, by William E.
