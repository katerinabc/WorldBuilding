"Ten thousand\r\ncredits for this man, dead or alive. Contact Lazar of the Security\r\nPolice. Harry Horn. Thirty-four, five feet, eleven inches, one hundred\r\nand seventy-two pounds."\r\n\r\nLynn Brickel snapped off the humming machine. She frowned. Horn had been\r\nhigh in the Martian Security Police, one of Lazar\'s top men. Now Horn\r\nturned out to be a spy for Earth. Why hadn\'t she been told? Was Green\r\nlosing his trust in her? Hadn\'t she helped McLean and Sanderson escape\r\nfrom Mars?\r\n\r\nHer short tunic shimmered as she began to pace the floor. She stopped\r\nshort as a hum splashed through the room. She went quickly to the door\r\nand pressed a red button on the wall.\r\n\r\nBut the vibration of the elevator did not reach her ears. Puzzled, she\r\nopened the door, stepped into the marble hall. She shrugged, started to\r\nreturn to her apartment when the sound of footsteps on the stairs halted\r\nher. She waited.\r\n\r\nHe came into view. Harry Horn. There was no mistaking his face. It had\r\nflashed on and off the telecaster throughout the day.\r\n\r\n"Brickel?" he said, coming up to her.\r\n\r\nHis white coveralls were spotted with grime. There was a dark bruise on\r\nhis right cheek.\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said.\r\n\r\n"I\'m Harry Horn."\r\n\r\n"I know.

"\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got to help me." His voice was urgent, pleading. He brushed past\r\nher, into her room. She walked in after him, shut and locked the door,\r\nleaned her back against it.\r\n\r\n"You can\'t stay here," she said.\r\n\r\n"Are you alone?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said. "I\'m alone."\r\n\r\nHe went through the apartment, returned to the front room. "I had to\r\nmake sure." He sank into the low divan, covered his face with his hands.\r\n\r\nShe walked toward him. "You can\'t stay here," she repeated.\r\n\r\nHe looked up at her, his eyes frightened. "Do you have any idea of what\r\nLazar will do to me once he gets his fat hands around my throat? He\r\nwon\'t kill me right away."\r\n\r\n"Why come to me?"\r\n\r\n"You can help me."\r\n\r\n"What can I do?"\r\n\r\n"You can help me get away. A turbo-engine space ship. That\'s all I need.\r\nIt\'s small and fast."\r\n\r\n"But why come to me? You haven\'t explained."\r\n\r\n"You helped McLean and Sanderson."\r\n\r\n"How do you know this?"\r\n\r\n"We\'re both in the same organization but not in the same unit. The\r\nleader of my unit instructed me to go to you."\r\n\r\n"I see. Who is your leader?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t tell you. You know that. I wouldn\'t ask you your leader\'s\r\nname."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLynn shrugged slim shoulders. "It wouldn\'t make any difference. He is\r\nnot stationed on Mars."\r\n\r\nHorn jumped to his feet. "You will help me?"\r\n\r\n"If I can."\r\n\r\n"Can you get me the ship?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose. But we\'ll have to wait for night. It is dangerous to do\r\nanything now. Ten thousand credits. Lazar wants you awful bad. He\r\noffered five for both McLean and Sanderson."\r\n\r\n"I was very close to Lazar in the Security Police. I know too much."\r\n\r\n"We all make mistakes."\r\n\r\n"I envy your logic. But I can\'t see it that way. I was considered too\r\ngood an agent to make a mistake."\r\n\r\n"It\'s too late to cry over it now. When it is dark I\'ll contact--a\r\nfriend--and have the space ship ready."\r\n\r\nHorn grinned. "You\'re still not sure of me?"\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t that. But you don\'t belong to my unit. We can\'t name names to\r\noutsiders."\r\n\r\n"You\'re right, of course.

You\'ve been well trained."\r\n\r\n"Are you hungry?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nShe set food in front of him and watched him eat.\r\n\r\n"What is Lazar like?" she asked. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
"I have heard of him."\r\n\r\n"Cruel," he said. "A sadist. Death is the easy way out when you\'re in\r\nLazar\'s hands."\r\n\r\n"It will soon be dark," she said.\r\n\r\nHe stood up, his hunger satisfied. "Tell me," he said, "was it difficult\r\ngetting Sanderson and McLean out of Mars?"\r\n\r\n"No," she said. "Not difficult at all."\r\n\r\n"Good." He went to the interphone. He dialed, spoke, "You may come up\r\nnow."\r\n\r\n"What are you doing?" 

=== Chunk 5 ===
her face paled.\r\n\r\nHe turned to her, smiling. "Lazar was wondering how Sanderson and McLean\r\nescaped. You were on the master list of suspects. I was waiting for you\r\nto confess."\r\n\r\nLynn stiffened. "It--it was a trick."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right, Brickel. Too bad. You\'re too pretty to die."\r\n\r\n"That--that was a message to Lazar."\r\n\r\n"Yes. He\'ll be here shortly."\r\n\r\nLynn slipped her hand in the pocket of her tunic, brought out a small\r\nblaster.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be a fool," Horn said. "Maybe you\'ll be spared. Why take your\r\nlife? Just tell all you know?"\r\n\r\nLynn smiled. "I wasn\'t thinking of taking my life. But yours.

=== Chunk 6 ===
"\r\n\r\nHorn frowned. "Don\'t be an idiot." He advanced toward her.\r\n\r\nLynn shook her head slowly. "Now it\'s my turn to be clever."\r\n\r\nHorn\'s face went wild. "You can\'t escape Lazar! Listen to me--"\r\n\r\nShe blasted him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLynn opened the door.\r\n\r\nLazar stood there, fat and ugly. There were two men of the Security\r\nPolice with him.\r\n\r\n"Come in," she invited.\r\n\r\nThey came in. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
She shut the door. Lazar looked down at the dead Harry\r\nHorn.\r\n\r\n"You said dead or alive," Lynn reminded Lazar. "You owe me ten thousand\r\ncredits."\r\n\r\n"What happened?" Lazar snapped at her. His flesh-bedded eyes studied\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"He came to me for help. I had to bide my time. I told him I\'d help him.\r\nI was waiting for the chance to get to you. He was by the interphone a\r\nfew minutes ago. It was the chance I needed. I pulled my blaster,\r\ncovered him. He made a dash for freedom so I had to kill him."\r\n\r\n"This is crazy," one of the men said. "Horn must have had her\r\nconfession. But now what do we do for evidence?

=== Chunk 8 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Shut up!" Lazar snapped.\r\n\r\n"Your word is good, isn\'t it, Lazar?" Lynn said.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"The ten thousand credits. As a loyal citizen I\'ve earned them."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll get your credits," Lazar snarled, frustration in his eyes.\r\n\r\n"I know I will," Lynn said, smiling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Imagination_ May 1954.
