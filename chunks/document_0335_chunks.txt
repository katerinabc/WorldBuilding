=== Chunk 2 ===
John Bartok replaced the test tube carefully in its rack with\r\nfingers that shook a little. His pleasant, plump-cheeked face had the\r\nblank look of a man who has had too great a shock to assimilate, so\r\nthat for the moment he feels nothing.\r\n\r\nHe got to his feet. Absently he ran stained, spatulate-tipped fingers\r\nthrough his thinning blond hair and groped for a cigarette. The liquid\r\nin the test tube caught a pinpoint of light from the fluorescents and\r\nthin fumes escaped upwards from its surface. Dr. Bartok shuddered\r\nslightly and turned toward the broad plate glass window that spread\r\nclear across the front of the chrome and enamel lab.\r\n\r\nBehind him the swinging door squeaked. A hearty voice boomed greeting.\r\n"Well, John!"\r\n\r\nDr. Goodwin, head of the Nelson Foundation, thought it part of his\r\nduties to boom heartily. He was a plump man in morning coat and\r\nstriped trousers with the inevitable pince-nez on a black ribbon. He\r\nwas a greeter, a hand-pumper, a speech-maker and a born politician.\r\nHe was also a surprisingly able physicist. His work on gamma and\r\nbeta particles, publicized by his own skilled hand, had won him the\r\ndirectorship of the Nelson Foundation. He gave his men a free hand in\r\ntheir research, but he thought it his right to snoop into their work at\r\nall times so that few of them had any illusion of freedom.\r\n\r\nJohn Bartok did not turn. "I\'ve got it, Dr. Goodwin," he said and\r\ncontinued to look out the window.\r\n\r\nThe manicured lawns of the Nelson Foundation were a well ordered green\r\nin the spring sunshine. A marble wing of the building rose to his\r\nright. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Through the slits of partly-drawn blinds he could see laboratory\r\nworkers at their jobs. Below, a girl assistant walked briskly along\r\none of the curving paths that wound through the flower beds, her white\r\nstockings and shoes twinkling under the crisp blue of her cape.\r\n\r\n"Got it? You\'ve got it?" Goodwin repeated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBartok turned and placed his back to the window, releasing his grasp on\r\nthe sanity of sun and grass.\r\n\r\n"The new weapon," he said flatly. "The final--the irresistible weapon.\r\nThe thing we\'ve been searching for ever since the stalemate of the atom\r\nbomb."\r\n\r\nExcitement flamed in Goodwin\'s round face. His color mounted. "Where?\r\nWhat is it?" he demanded. "I\'ll phone General McComber!"\r\n\r\nBartok jerked his cigarette towards the test tube, which still gave off\r\nfaint white fumes.\r\n\r\n"This?" Goodwin stared at it fascinated. "It\'s--"\r\n\r\n"It\'s the deadliest thing a man\'s imagination could ever hope to\r\nconceive," Bartok said flatly. He was not boasting. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
He was stating a\r\nsimple fact. "Beside it the atom bomb is like a child\'s pea-shooter."\r\n\r\nGoodwin edged back instinctively.\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s harmless enough by itself," Bartok said. "It\'s a catalyst.\r\nAdd it to something else, and--" He drew a deep breath. "Remember the\r\nscare the atom bomb threw into the world? And the menace of radioactive\r\ndust? And germ warfare? Remember people talking about the end of\r\nthe human race as though it were just around the corner?" He nodded\r\ngloomily at the test tube. "Well, there it is, the real thing, if that\r\nstuff ever gets loose."\r\n\r\nThe uneasiness had fled Goodwin\'s face. His jowls were alight with\r\nexcitement. He seized Bartok\'s hand, pumping it like a driveshaft.\r\n\r\n"Congratulations," he beamed. "This puts us at the top of the heap\r\nagain. It\'ll mean a lot to the Nelson Foundation, John. And to you.\r\nI\'ve got to call the War Department!"\r\n\r\nOn his way to the door he stopped, turned back. "By the way," he asked.\r\n"What is it you add that stuff to, to make it the potent weapon?"\r\n\r\nBartok shifted his eyes and looked unhappy. "I\'d rather not say," he\r\nmuttered. "Not till I think this out a little more."\r\n\r\n"Think what out?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid of that stuff," Bartok said reluctantly. "It\'s--it\'s far\r\nmore dangerous--well, sir, this time it\'s not just scare talk. It\r\nreally could mean the end of man, the end of the world!"\r\n\r\n"Nonsense," Goodwin said. "That\'s not for you to judge, John! We\'ve got\r\nto turn it over to the War Department! It will make us the strongest\r\nnation on earth, give us control! Just the threat of having it will be\r\nenough. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
We won\'t have to use it!"\r\n\r\nBartok gave him a cynical glance and said nothing.\r\n\r\n"Look." Goodwin\'s plump finger pointed to a newspaper lying open on a\r\nlab bench. Headlines flared.\r\n\r\n                     ATOMIC WEAPONS NOT TO BE USED\r\n\r\n                           REPRISALS FEARED\r\n\r\n    Top ranking military men believe atomic weapons will not be used in\r\n    future wars because belligerents will fear reprisals, it was\r\n    revealed today by a confidential source close to high officials in\r\n    the War Department. The one way to victory and the best hope of\r\n    avoiding war is to maintain the nation\'s war machine in a state of\r\n    immediate readiness.\r\n\r\n"You see?" Goodwin said. "Anything as terrible as you say this is could\r\nnever be used. Just having it--and letting other nations know we have\r\nit--is insurance against anybody jumping on us. Keep them scared to\r\ndeath."\r\n\r\nHe beamed upon the silent Bartok. "I\'ll call General McComber to come\r\ndown at once." The swinging door squealed and flapped behind his\r\nconfident exit.\r\n\r\nDr. John Bartok took his cigarette and himself into the chair in front\r\nof the lab table and slumped down to stare at the gently fuming test\r\ntube. He was tired and he was confused. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
He was a little afraid of the\r\nresponsibility thrust so suddenly upon him.\r\n\r\nThere was no simple decision to be made here. He could not deny his\r\ncountry a weapon it might possibly need desperately in some unknown\r\nfuture emergency. To withhold it might mean destruction. And to give\r\nit--to turn it over to some thick-necked general who thought of war\r\nprincipally as a road to promotions and glory? Bartok was under no\r\nillusions as to the average military mind, American or otherwise.\r\n\r\nYet he shrank from the thought of making so great a decision himself,\r\nof bucking the Foundation and the War Department by himself. Perhaps\r\nGoodwin was right, the weapon need never be used. Its threat alone\r\nmight be enough. In any case, perhaps Congress or the people, or\r\nthe professional trouble shooters, should decide, not John Bartok,\r\nlaboratory man.\r\n\r\nMiserably he rubbed his hair until it stood up in wild disarray on his\r\npink scalp. He leaned forward to stare into the sauterne colored fluid.\r\nThe fumes rose to his nostrils, they tickled and made him want to\r\nsneeze. Suddenly he was dizzy, the lab began to heave unsteadily about\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAlarmed, Bartok pulled back, tried to climb to his feet. The movement\r\nmade his head spin wildly. The whole lab floated up into a narrowing\r\nfunnel above him and the darkness contracted about him like overlapping\r\nlayers of a blanket.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter a long time there was light. He opened heavy lids to see a red\r\nglow of sun. Somewhere there was a guttural, familiar chanting. The\r\nsmell of woodland was in his nostrils. Under him the foam rubber\r\ncushion had grown suddenly hard and uncomfortable. His vision cleared\r\nand amazement froze him.\r\n\r\nHe was squatted on a ledge in the face of a rough cliff-like slope.\r\nBefore him a red sunset blazed over a wild, jungle-thick forest. Behind\r\nhim was a cave mouth in which a fire flickered. From its depths came\r\nthe chanting which was so strangely familiar.\r\n\r\nBartok looked down at himself. His limbs were all but naked, only a\r\nwolfskin draped about his hips served as both garment and belt. Arms\r\nand legs were hugely muscled, thick with furry hair. A beard spread its\r\nbushy length upon his hirsute chest.\r\n\r\nHe was neither alarmed nor frightened. He was Krug of the Cave\r\nDwellers, and this was his home. Behind him was a bustle and Ngeel, the\r\nchief, came out on the ledge. He was a stocky, powerful man, wearing\r\nthe leopard skin of authority, plus a bustling official manner, plus a\r\nbelief that his tribesmen were his by right.\r\n\r\nNgeel squatted down beside Krug and chuckled deep in his throat. "They\r\ncome, the Forest Men," he grunted. "They think to kill. We shall kill\r\nmany and there will be much feasting."\r\n\r\nKrug stared, troubled, out over the sea of waving branches. A dim\r\nthought struggled for expression in his mind.\r\n\r\n"Always there is fighting," he said. "Always killing. We are men, not\r\nbeasts. There is food for all. Must the women always weep for the dead,\r\nmust children always wail for mothers and fathers slain?"\r\n\r\nNgeel\'s bushy eyebrows drew down. "In my father\'s day," he said, "men\r\nwere truly wiser. Now we breed a race of fools. The world is very old,\r\nmy father told me, and there has always been war. Men will always kill.\r\nDo you think to stop it with words? If we kill more of the Forest Men\r\nthan they kill us, there will be no more war."\r\n\r\nKrug shrugged massive shoulders. He leaned back against the rock and\r\nbegan again to twist and plait some strips of skin.\r\n\r\n"What is that?" Ngeel asked.\r\n\r\n"Something I am making. I had thought if I took--"\r\n\r\n"They come!" Ngeel rose suddenly, began to roar a warning. "They come!"\r\n\r\nOut of the forest shadows streamed a broken mass of men. They were\r\narmed with clubs, spears sharpened and hardened in the fire, and\r\nstones. They charged the cliff front.\r\n\r\nStones hurtled down upon them, and they gave ground momentarily,\r\nleaving one or two dark forms stretched out. Then Ngeel and the men of\r\nthe Caves swung down the steep slope to give battle.\r\n\r\nThere was the snarling shock of combat, vicious but short. The\r\nForest Men broke and fell back to the trees. Ngeel called back his\r\nblood-maddened warriors, who would have followed. The chief was canny,\r\nhe knew the Forest Men held the advantage in the shadowy aisles that\r\nwere their home.\r\n\r\nFrom the fringes of the wood, the Forest Men shouted taunts, flung an\r\noccasional spear or stone which fell short. The Cave Men huddled at the\r\nbase of the cliff, licking their wounds.\r\n\r\nUp above, Krug worked busily at his plaiting. Ngeel climbed to his\r\nledge.\r\n\r\n"This is bad," said the chief. "They keep us from hunting, even from\r\nwater, if they stay."\r\n\r\n"They will not stay," Krug said.\r\n\r\nHe stood up. In his hand he held the cup-like piece between them. Krug\r\nsearched about until he found a round stone about the size of his fist.\r\nHe placed it in the leather cup.\r\n\r\nAs Ngeel watched, hairy mouth agape, Krug began to swing the loaded\r\ncontraption round his head. Faster and faster it went, until it\r\nwhistled through the air and dissolved into a blur. Then he let one of\r\nthe thongs slip from his fingers.\r\n\r\nSheer luck played its part that day as it so often does. Had the stone\r\nfallen harmlessly, the effect would have been lost. But the astonished\r\ncavemen saw the missile scream through the air with a force that no\r\nhand-thrown rock could match. Out, out, it arched, far beyond any man\'s\r\nthrowing distance.\r\n\r\nA Forest Man, staring, slack-jawed, was slow to duck. The stone took\r\nhim full in the face with sodden crunch. There was a horrid, strangled\r\nscream, he tossed wide his huge arms and fell dead amidst his terror\r\nstricken fellows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The stone whizzed from the sling, took terrible toll.]\r\n\r\nWith howls of dismay, the Forest Men fled into the shadows of the wood.\r\n\r\nKrug was a little astonished himself at the appalling success of his\r\nfirst attempt. But the effect upon Ngeel was even more striking. Always\r\nthe politician, he recovered swiftly.\r\n\r\n"This is magic," he said. "It makes us the most powerful tribe in the\r\nland. The Forest Men shall fear us and the men of the marshes and\r\nthe river tremble at our name!" Shrewdly he added, "There will be no\r\nmore wars, now, Krug. Your magic is too strong. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
None shall dare stand\r\nagainst us!"\r\n\r\nMusing, he stroked his beard. "Man is old, my father said," he\r\nmuttered, "and always there has been war. But now is an end to war, for\r\nwith magic that kills at such a distance, war is too terrible. There\r\nwill be no more wars!"\r\n\r\nAnd looking down at him, Krug wrestled with the astonishing idea that\r\nby inventing a terrible weapon of war, he had made war impossible. The\r\nweapon was too terrible to use.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo there was peace. The tribe hunted in the fringes of the forest and\r\nalong the river bank and others fled before their approach. There was\r\npeace for the space of a moon.\r\n\r\nThen a hunter came racing with the word that the Forest Men were coming.\r\n\r\n"Coming?" Ngeel\'s bushy brows drew down in stupefied disbelief. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
"They\r\nhave forgotten so soon? They need another lesson!"\r\n\r\nConfident, Krug stood upon the rocky shelf and waited. And alongside\r\nhim stood a dozen warriors of the tribe, all armed with slings, all\r\ntrained by him. Each carried smooth round stones in a pouch at his\r\nbelt. They were the most terrible fighting force the world had yet seen.\r\n\r\nShadows moved at the edge of the wood, broke free and slid out into the\r\nsunlight.\r\n\r\n"They come!" Ngeel grunted.\r\n\r\nAt Krug\'s word, the slingmen reached for stones. The slings began to\r\nwhirl overhead, rise in pitch to a whistle. Then the missiles arched\r\nout into the air. The Cave Men and their women shouted as the stones\r\nflew. They heard the heavy thump as the projectiles landed. But there\r\nwere no screams from the Forest Men, there were no crushed and\r\nbleeding forms stretched upon the grass. The invaders came on.\r\n\r\nAnd now, as they came closer, the Cave Men saw why. Each of the Forest\r\nMen carried before him a round leather shield stretched on a tough\r\ngreen sapling bent into a hoop. The strong rawhide took the full shock\r\nof a flung stone and let it rebound without harm. Safe behind their\r\nmoving forts, the Forest Men came swiftly on, to reach and climb the\r\nwall. And now again came the snarling shock of combat, as men met and\r\nstrove hand to hand with club and knife and teeth.\r\n\r\nKrug flung down his useless sling and snatched up his club. A Forest\r\nMan rushed upon him with mighty bludgeon upraised. It wavered in the\r\nair and then melted away. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
Layers of darkness unwrapped about him.\r\nShining white walls swam and flowed into place to settle solidly. Dr.\r\nJohn Bartok opened his eyes upon the familiar sights of his laboratory.\r\n\r\nHe raised his head. The test tube rested as before in its rack. The\r\nthin white fumes curled lazily upward. He drew back in belated alarm.\r\nHe could still hear the snarling roar of that savage battle, still\r\nsmell the blood and heat of war and death. Good heavens, was it the\r\nfumes? Had they anaesthetized him? Had he dreamed it all?\r\n\r\nHe found a cigarette and sat back, away from the test tube, brooding.\r\nSnatches of words floated through his mind.\r\n\r\n"Too terrible to use--"\r\n\r\n"This will end wars--"\r\n\r\n"All will fear us. Just having it will be enough. We will never have to\r\nuse it."\r\n\r\nThe cigarette burned down. He got up. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
His face was pale and set.\r\n\r\nThe swinging door squeaked and Dr. Goodwin bustled in, face glowing\r\nwith excitement.\r\n\r\n"John, here\'s General McComber. He came right down by helicopter when\r\nI told him--John, where is it? John, what are you doing?" 

=== Chunk 11 ===
His usually\r\ncontrolled voice rose to a shriek.\r\n\r\nDr. John Bartok turned from the sink. He shook the last few drops of\r\nwater from the glass.\r\n\r\n"I\'m just rinsing out this test tube," he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
