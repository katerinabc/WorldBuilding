=== Chunk 2 ===
When a man of the future wants solitude he picks a slab of\r\n    rock floating in space four light years east of Andromeda. Here is a\r\n    gentle little story about a man who sought the solitude of such a\r\n    location. And who did he take along for company? None other than\r\n    Charles the Robot._\r\n\r\n\r\nMark Rogers was a prospector, and he went to the asteroid belt looking\r\nfor radioactives and rare metals. He searched for years, never finding\r\nmuch, hopping from fragment to fragment. After a time he settled on a\r\nslab of rock half a mile thick.\r\n\r\nRogers had been born old, and he didn\'t age much past a point. His face\r\nwas white with the pallor of space, and his hands shook a little. He\r\ncalled his slab of rock Martha, after no girl he had ever known.\r\n\r\nHe made a little strike, enough to equip Martha with an air pump and a\r\nshack, a few tons of dirt and some water tanks, and a robot. Then he\r\nsettled back and watched the stars.\r\n\r\nThe robot he bought was a standard-model all-around worker, with\r\nbuilt-in memory and a thirty-word vocabulary. Mark added to that, bit\r\nby bit. He was something of a tinkerer, and he enjoyed adapting his\r\nenvironment to himself.\r\n\r\nAt first, all the robot could say was "Yes, sir," and "No, sir." He\r\ncould state simple problems: "The air pump is laboring, sir." "The corn\r\nis budding, sir." He could perform a satisfactory salutation: "Good\r\nmorning, sir."\r\n\r\nMark changed that. He eliminated the "sirs" from the robot\'s vocabulary;\r\nequality was the rule on Mark\'s hunk of rock. Then he dubbed the robot\r\nCharles, after a father he had never known.\r\n\r\nAs the years passed, the air pump began to labor a little as it\r\nconverted the oxygen in the planetoid\'s rock into a breathable\r\natmosphere. The air seeped into space, and the pump worked a little\r\nharder, supplying more.\r\n\r\nThe crops continued to grow on the tamed black dirt of the planetoid.\r\nLooking up, Mark could see the sheer blackness of the river of space,\r\nthe floating points of the stars. Around him, under him, overhead,\r\nmasses of rock drifted, and sometimes the starlight glinted from their\r\nblack sides. Occasionally, Mark caught a glimpse of Mars or Jupiter.\r\nOnce he thought he saw Earth.\r\n\r\nMark began to tape new responses into Charles. He added simple responses\r\nto cue words. When he said, "How does it look?" Charles would answer,\r\n"Oh, pretty good, I guess."\r\n\r\nAt first the answers were what Mark had been answering himself, in the\r\nlong dialogue held over the years. But, slowly, he began to build a new\r\npersonality into Charles.\r\n\r\nMark had always been suspicious and scornful of women. But for some\r\nreason he didn\'t tape the same suspicion into Charles. Charles\' outlook\r\nwas quite different.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"What do you think of girls?" Mark would ask, sitting on a packing case\r\noutside the shack, after the chores were done.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know. You have to find the right one." The robot would\r\nreply dutifully, repeating what had been put on its tape.\r\n\r\n"I never saw a good one yet," Mark would say.\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s not fair. Perhaps you didn\'t look long enough. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
There\'s a\r\ngirl in the world for every man."\r\n\r\n"You\'re a romantic!" Mark would say scornfully. The robot would pause--a\r\nbuilt-in pause--and chuckle a carefully constructed chuckle.\r\n\r\n"I dreamed of a girl named Martha once," Charles would say. "Maybe if I\r\nwould have looked, I would have found her.

=== Chunk 4 ===
"\r\n\r\nAnd then it would be bedtime. Or perhaps Mark would want more\r\nconversation. "What do you think of girls?" he would ask again, and\r\nthe discussion would follow its same course.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCharles grew old. His limbs lost their flexibility, and some of his\r\nwiring started to corrode. Mark would spend hours keeping the robot in\r\nrepair.\r\n\r\n"You\'re getting rusty," he would cackle.\r\n\r\n"You\'re not so young yourself," Charles would reply. He had an answer\r\nfor almost everything. Nothing involved, but an answer.\r\n\r\nIt was always night on Martha, but Mark broke up his time into mornings,\r\nafternoons and evenings. Their life followed a simple routine.\r\nBreakfast, from vegetables and Mark\'s canned store. Then the robot would\r\nwork in the fields, and the plants grew used to his touch. Mark would\r\nrepair the pump, check the water supply, and straighten up the\r\nimmaculate shack. Lunch, and the robot\'s chores were usually finished.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe two would sit on the packing case and watch the stars. They would\r\ntalk until supper, and sometimes late into the endless night.\r\n\r\nIn time, Mark built more complicated conversations into Charles. He\r\ncouldn\'t give the robot free choice, of course, but he managed a pretty\r\nclose approximation of it. Slowly, Charles\' personality emerged. But it\r\nwas strikingly different from Mark\'s.\r\n\r\nWhere Mark was querulous, Charles was calm. Mark was sardonic, Charles\r\nwas naive. Mark was a cynic, Charles was an idealist. Mark was often\r\nsad; Charles was forever content.\r\n\r\nAnd in time, Mark forgot he had built the answers into Charles. He\r\naccepted the robot as a friend, of about his own age. A friend of long\r\nyears\' standing.\r\n\r\n"The thing I don\'t understand," Mark would say, "is why a man like you\r\nwants to live here. I mean, it\'s all right for me. No one cares about\r\nme, and I never gave much of a damn about anyone. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
But why you?"\r\n\r\n"Here I have a whole world," Charles would reply, "where on Earth I had\r\nto share with billions. I have the stars, bigger and brighter than on\r\nEarth. I have all space around me, close, like still waters. And I have\r\nyou, Mark."\r\n\r\n"Now, don\'t go getting sentimental on me--"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not. Friendship counts. Love was lost long ago, Mark. The love of a\r\ngirl named Martha, whom neither of us ever met. And that\'s a pity. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
But\r\nfriendship remains, and the eternal night."\r\n\r\n"You\'re a bloody poet," Mark would say, half admiringly. "A poor poet."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTime passed unnoticed by the stars, and the air pump hissed and clanked\r\nand leaked. Mark was fixing it constantly, but the air of Martha became\r\nincreasingly rare. Although Charles labored in the fields, the crops,\r\ndeprived of sufficient air, died.\r\n\r\nMark was tired now, and barely able to crawl around, even without the\r\ngrip of gravity. He stayed in his bunk most of the time. Charles fed him\r\nas best he could, moving on rusty, creaking limbs.\r\n\r\n"What do you think of girls?"\r\n\r\n"I never saw a good one yet."\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s not fair."\r\n\r\nMark was too tired to see the end coming, and Charles wasn\'t interested.\r\nBut the end was on its way. The air pump threatened to give out\r\nmomentarily. There hadn\'t been any food for days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"But why you?" Gasping in the escaping air. Strangling.\r\n\r\n"Here I have a whole world--"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t get sentimental--"\r\n\r\n"And the love of a girl named Martha."\r\n\r\nFrom his bunk Mark saw the stars for the last time. Big, bigger than\r\never, endlessly floating in the still waters of space.\r\n\r\n"The stars ..." Mark said.\r\n\r\n"Yes?"\r\n\r\n"The sun?"\r\n\r\n"--shall shine as now."\r\n\r\n"A bloody poet."\r\n\r\n"A poor poet."\r\n\r\n"And girls?"\r\n\r\n"I dreamed of a girl named Martha once. Maybe if--"\r\n\r\n"What do you think of girls? And stars? 

=== Chunk 7 ===
And Earth?" And it was bedtime,\r\nthis time forever.\r\n\r\nCharles stood beside the body of his friend. He felt for a pulse once,\r\nand allowed the withered hand to fall. He walked to a corner of the\r\nshack and turned off the tired air pump.\r\n\r\nThe tape that Mark had prepared had a few cracked inches left to run. "I\r\nhope he finds his Martha," the robot croaked, and then the tape broke.\r\n\r\nHis rusted limbs would not bend, and he stood frozen, staring back at\r\nthe naked stars. Then he bowed his head.\r\n\r\n"The Lord is my shepherd," Charles said. "I shall not want. He maketh me\r\nto lie down in green pastures; he leadeth me ..."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ Oct.-Nov. 1953.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.
