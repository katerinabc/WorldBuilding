She walked across the\r\nparlor to the gun-rack and strapped a holstered pistol to her hip, just\r\nabove the rustling flare of the full skirt of her evening dress.\r\n\r\nThe green sun\'s slanting rays in the parlor window told her it was late\r\nafternoon, nearly time to get started. She went to the full-length\r\nmirror. Beside the mirror hung the framed copy of the Constitution of\r\nPamplin, hand-lettered on parchment. In bold red letters it proclaimed:\r\n\r\n    _We, the people of Pamplin, hold that_:\r\n\r\n    _1. No government is the best government._\r\n\r\n    _2. A man\'s home is his castle._\r\n\r\n    _3. A woman\'s rights are equal to a man\'s rights._\r\n\r\n    _4. Only the brave deserve the fair._\r\n\r\nLauria looked in the mirror, almost fearfully.\r\n\r\nShe saw with approval the breadth of her hips, the erectness of her\r\nshoulders. With more reluctance, her eyes rose to her face. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
There was\r\nstill beauty there, she told herself, to the discerning eye. That touch\r\nof slackness to the jaw, that faint hollowness of cheek: those were no\r\ndoubt exaggerated by the dimness of the room.\r\n\r\nIn a table drawer, Lauria found jars and tubes. From them she carefully\r\nfilled in a fuller form for her mouth, dabbed heavily at her cheeks,\r\ntouched up her eyes, smeared over her jawline. She fluffed out the\r\nthinning blond hair and donned a light scarf then she removed the heavy\r\nbars from the front door. She went out, and locked its triple locks\r\nbehind her. She gazed around cautiously and stepped lightly down the\r\ngravelled path. Around the house, the grounds were a solid mass of\r\nblooming flowers. Lauria had plenty of time to spend in the garden. The\r\nbaskets and other handicraft articles that were her means of income\r\nleft her a good deal of leisure, and cooking and household chores were\r\nroutine and brief.\r\n\r\nFarther from the house, the grounds looked better kept than they were.\r\nIt was fortunate that the blue grass of the planet Pamplin grew short\r\nand neat, for Lauria never would have been able to keep the ten acres\r\nof her property trimmed. But the big trees that shaded the grounds had\r\ndropped twigs and leaves that she wouldn\'t clear away until the big\r\neffort of the fall clean-up.\r\n\r\nThe path curved down past a small cleared area in which a dozen upright\r\nwooden markers were spaced in rows. This was the cemetery.\r\n\r\nShe paused to look out across the neat rows of markers. There were\r\nmen buried there. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Twelve young men. They had died by her hand, in\r\naccordance with the Constitution and the law.\r\n\r\nAt one end of the cemetery stood a large wooden plaque on which she had\r\ncarved the Constitution of Pamplin. Many times had her mother explained\r\nthe meaning of the Constitution to Lauria, when Lauria was a little\r\ngirl and still intruding on her mother\'s privacy.\r\n\r\n"The people who colonized Pamplin left Earth many years ago because\r\nthere they always had to sacrifice some of their individual rights\r\nto some government," her mother had said. "There are many kinds of\r\ngovernments, but all of them try to regulate people. And to regulate\r\npeople, they have to invade people\'s privacy.\r\n\r\n"The people of Pamplin came to this world because we don\'t want any\r\ngovernment. We believe that every man and woman should have his\r\nindividual right to do as he pleases, without other people bothering\r\nhim.

=== Chunk 5 ===
"\r\n\r\n"But what does No. 4 mean, Mother?" Lauria had asked. "\'_Only the\r\nbrave deserve the fair?_\'"\r\n\r\n"That means," replied her mother, for Lauria was fourteen and deserved\r\nto know these things, "that a woman on Pamplin is not subservient to\r\nthe whims of men. No man may approach her and take her in his arms\r\nunless he has fought his way through the defenses of her home. Then\r\nthey may agree to share the home, if they wish, but no woman of any\r\ncharacter will permit a man to do this until he has proved his valor by\r\nfighting his way to her."\r\n\r\n"Then my father must have been a brave man, wasn\'t he, Mother?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, he was, my dear," said her mother, smiling tenderly. "He was very\r\npersuasive, too."\r\n\r\nLauria never saw her father, and no other man invaded the privacy of\r\nher mother\'s home while she lived there. Two men tried, and Lauria\r\nremembered the tense stirrings about the darkened house in the dead of\r\nnight, the flash and roar of the guns, and her frightened glimpses of\r\nthe men her mother had shot down as they tried to break in.\r\n\r\nHer father must have been very courageous, Lauria thought. She\r\nconstructed a handsome picture of her father in her mind, and dreamed\r\nof the day a handsome man like he would conquer her, when she lived in\r\nher own home.\r\n\r\nLauria\'s mother had some property on which she wanted Lauria to build\r\na house, but Lauria was impatient. Even though her mother would hire\r\nmen from town, Lauria would have to do much of the work herself and it\r\nwould take years. So at sixteen, Lauria got her a house, ready-built.\r\n\r\nShe crept past the defenses of one of the best homes in the area. She\r\nbroke into the house at night and killed the defender, a tired old man,\r\nin a blazing gun battle. The house became her home, and she improved\r\nits defenses.\r\n\r\nHer ownership of the house, and her manner of taking it, gave her an\r\nimmediate social standing far above that of her mother. She knew that\r\nshe was envied: the bright-haired, beautiful young woman who held the\r\nramparts of the big house and challenged all comers to conquer her.\r\n\r\nThere were men who tried, and the first nearly succeeded. Even now,\r\nafter many years, she could remember Poll\'s youthful, arrogant face,\r\nhis lazy smile. They had met in the market place.\r\n\r\n"An attractive spitfire, if ever I saw one," he had said to her. "Would\r\nyou surrender to my arms, pretty one?"\r\n\r\n"If you\'re strong enough to come and take me," she challenged, fire\r\nsinging in her blood.\r\n\r\nAnd that night he had come. In the starlight she fired from her windows\r\nat the shadowy figure that flitted among the bushes and trees, and\r\npowder smoke hung heavy in the air. It was after several hours and a\r\nlong silence, when she thought he had given up and gone away, that he\r\nalmost surprised her.\r\n\r\nShe was crouching in the parlour, waiting for the dawn, when there was\r\na slight noise behind her. She whirled, whipping up her gun, and he\r\nwas coming toward her swiftly and silently from the hall, a smile of\r\ntriumph on his handsome face.\r\n\r\nHe was holding out his arms for her and there was no weapon in his hand\r\nwhen she shot him down.\r\n\r\nShe wept for a long time over his fair body, and knew to her shame that\r\nshe had wanted him to conquer. Then she took him out and buried him\r\nbeneath the grass. His grave was the first one, and behind it later\r\nshe erected the wooden plaque bearing the words of the Constitution of\r\nPamplin.\r\n\r\nOthers had tried, and their graves were here, with Poll\'s. And the\r\nyears had passed, and no man had overrun the defenses of Lauria\'s house.\r\n\r\nThe frost of autumn was in her veins now as she looked at the graves\r\nof twelve young men, who had been young and eager in the years when\r\nshe had been young. Slowly she turned away, went out the barred front\r\ngate of her property and waited for the crowd of merrymakers she would\r\naccompany to the party in town.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe music reverberated gaily amid the rafters of the huge community\r\nhall. At one end a fire blazed merrily in a big fireplace. Young\r\ncouples, and their elders, danced variations of the steps that had been\r\nbrought from Earth generations ago.\r\n\r\nNo one wore weapons here, although every person in the hall had worn or\r\ncarried a gun on the way here. The guns were checked at the entrance,\r\nand the doors were barred against any lawless raider.\r\n\r\nHere, as in the market daily, people congregated. Here they were people\r\nand not individuals.\r\n\r\nOutside, between here and their homes, they were individuals again, but\r\nstill friendly, if wary. They carried their arms, they were careful\r\nof their language, they watched the people around them for signs of\r\naggression. Outside was a code of conduct that was different from the\r\nsociable code inside, a code that condoned a duel over an insult, that\r\nrecognized robbery, rape and even death if one were caught unarmed and\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nAnd in their homes ... well, there was Cholli Rikkard. He was one-armed\r\nbecause of a wound he had suffered conquering Fanni in her home. Cholli\r\nhad been a gay fellow who had stormed house after house of pretty women\r\nbefore, but after that he settled down with Fanni and they now had five\r\nchildren. They shared their privacy, but half a dozen times Cholli had\r\nstayed up all night fighting off those who would invade it.\r\n\r\nThe strange thing was that one or more of those who had sought to\r\ninvade Cholli\'s home and take his wife and house from him might be\r\ndancing here tonight, perhaps chatting amiably with Cholli. Cholli\r\nmight even know them for the attackers. Here they were all friends,\r\nsuspending their cherished privacy for weekly companionship.\r\n\r\nLauria was one of those who sat among the oldest, and talked unhappily\r\nwith those on either side of her. It was not that she was that old,\r\nfor she wasn\'t. It was that Lauria\'s home now had the reputation of a\r\ndeadly, unassailable fortress, and few men cared even to dance with\r\nher. It was that they feared her, she told herself as she sat there\r\nafter only two dances.\r\n\r\n"Care to dance this one, Miss Lauria?"\r\n\r\nShe looked up, startled. It was Cholli Rikkard, smiling at her, holding\r\nout his one arm apologetically.\r\n\r\nShe arose, gratefully, and took his hand. She and Cholli were old\r\nfriends. Perhaps it was the sympathy of the handicapped for the\r\nhandicapped: the man with only one arm for the woman with (perhaps?)\r\ntoo much stern pride.\r\n\r\n"Tell me something, Cholli," said Lauria as they danced. "Is it true\r\nthat many women deliberately allow men to invade their privacy?"\r\n\r\nHe looked at her blandly.\r\n\r\n"That would be a violation of the Constitution, Lauria," he said.\r\n\r\n"I know it would," she said impatiently. "But do they?

=== Chunk 6 ===
"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve heard rumours."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve heard rumours, too, but I want the truth. You know the truth,\r\nCholli. You conquered quite a few women before Fanni shot you in the\r\narm."\r\n\r\nHe grinned.\r\n\r\n"Fanni always was a poor shot," he said. "Or maybe she\'s a better shot\r\nthan I think. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Yes, Lauria, it\'s true. The Constitution is the law, and\r\nit\'s right in principle, but you have to face facts. If men and women\r\nadhered to the letter of the law in ... well, sex ... Pamplin would be\r\ndepopulated by now. I thought everybody knew that."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t," said Lauria miserably. "I suspected.... I\'d heard a lot of\r\ntalk. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
But ... well, tell me, Cholli, how is it done? How do men know, I\r\nmean, when a woman is going to wink at the Constitution and let a man\r\nenter her home without fighting his way in?"\r\n\r\n"It depends, Lauria. I suppose most often a woman has an understanding\r\nwith a certain man and he gives some sort of signal when he comes to\r\nher house, so he won\'t be shot. Some women--quite a few, it is--just\r\nsort of let it be known around that they won\'t shoot if a man comes\r\naround. That\'s more dangerous, though, and they have to be on guard."\r\n\r\n"I\'d think so," said Lauria indignantly. "Another woman could take\r\nadvantage of something like that and make a good haul."\r\n\r\nThere was a silence. Then Cholli said slily:\r\n\r\n"Did you want to get a message to some man--or get the word around\r\nthat...?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not!" 

=== Chunk 9 ===
she retorted firmly. "I abide by the Constitution, and\r\nI value my privacy."\r\n\r\n"Okay, Lauria. I just thought I could get the word passed for you." He\r\ngrinned. "If it weren\'t for this bum arm, I might have tried for you\r\nmyself before now."\r\n\r\nThe music stopped and they parted.\r\n\r\n"Wait, Cholli!" cried Lauria in a low intense voice. He turned and came\r\nback to her, looking at her quizzically.\r\n\r\n"Cholli," she said, almost in a whisper, "pass the word around tonight\r\nthat no young man will find my home defended!"\r\n\r\nShe turned her back quickly, her face flaming, and left the hall,\r\npicking up her scarf and gun at the door. She walked home alone,\r\nswiftly, holding up the hem of her skirt with her left hand and hoping\r\nsavagely that someone would try to waylay her.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was midnight when the alarm bell sounded.\r\n\r\nLauria had been sitting in the parlor, with no light but that of the\r\nfire, a hot drink in her hand, lost in turbulent thoughts.\r\n\r\nHer thoughts twisted slightly. Had she made it plain to Cholli that\r\nonly young men would be welcome?\r\n\r\nBut how could she toss aside everything in which she had believed for\r\nso long, on an impulse? Would she not redeem herself by shooting down\r\nany invader?\r\n\r\nShame was upon her now, for having told Cholli what she did. It was\r\nnot the perverse shame that had run hot in her that night when she had\r\nfought Poll and wanted to be defeated, but the shame of having done\r\nwhat she scorned other women for doing.\r\n\r\nBut Lauria was lonely now, and the fire was not as warm as it once had\r\nbeen. How many years had it been--ten? fifteen?--since the last young\r\nman had won her outer wall, only to fall beneath her bullets in the\r\nmoon-shadows?\r\n\r\nCould she turn now to the ways of other women, to dissemble, to shoot\r\nwide of the mark and put up a false defense? Could she now betray the\r\nweapons that had served her so well and true?\r\n\r\nOr would there be a thirteenth grave in the little cemetery on the\r\nmorrow?\r\n\r\nThe bell chattered nervously.\r\n\r\nShe arose and threw ashes on the fire. A weariness was in her bones.\r\nShe took a gun from the rack and made the rounds of the house, checking\r\nthe locks of doors and windows.\r\n\r\nAll was secure. More lithely, like a pantheress, she went from window\r\nto window, looking out, her gun ready. Some of the old wine of battle\r\nquickened in her blood.\r\n\r\nThe moon was bright, and the trees stood in great pools of shadow on\r\nthe grounds. The bushes stood like dark, bulky sentinels.\r\n\r\nAt last she saw him, a moving shadow against the still shadows,\r\ncreeping closer to the house. Her gun came up and she took aim,\r\ncarefully, through the barred window. Her hands were as cold as ice on\r\nthe gunstock.\r\n\r\nFor a moment he was still, and she lost him against the shadows. Then\r\nhe moved again.\r\n\r\nHer gun blossomed roaring flame and its stock kicked against her\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\nThe shadow leaped, became a man as it fled across a path of moonlight.\r\nHe was young, and he was smiling toward the window. Then he was\r\nswallowed up in the deeper shadows.\r\n\r\nFor a moment she was aghast, unbelieving. She had missed! Then, like a\r\nfrigid hand clutching her heart, came the realization: deliberately,\r\nwithout conscious volition, she had pulled the gun muzzle aside when\r\nshe fired.\r\n\r\nShe leaned against the wall, weak and perspiring. It was true, then.\r\nShe yearned so deeply for a man, she so feared the age that crept up\r\non her, that the principles of the Constitution no longer held real\r\nmeaning for her.\r\n\r\nShe did not seek to fire again. She knelt on the floor by the window\r\nand waited, looking listlessly into the embers of the fire across the\r\nroom. She felt suspended in a nightmare.\r\n\r\nShe heard the crack as the lock was broken on a window in the rear of\r\nthe house, and still she did not stir. But her heart began beating\r\nfaster, a cold beating that did not warm her body. She began to shiver\r\nuncontrollably.\r\n\r\nShe heard the soft, wary footsteps as he came through the house. In\r\nthe dimness, she saw his bulk come through the parlor door. A black\r\nveil passed momentarily before her eyes, and her gun slipped from lax\r\nfingers and fell to the floor with a clatter.\r\n\r\nHe leaped to one side, and the glow of the dying fire glinted from his\r\nweapon.\r\n\r\nBut she stood up against the window, in the moonlight, and spread her\r\nhands so he could see she was no longer armed.\r\n\r\n"I am helpless," she said in a voice that nearly choked her. "I cannot\r\nresist your taking me for your love."\r\n\r\nHis laugh boomed out in the rich darkness, and she could see that he\r\ndid not lower his weapon.\r\n\r\n"Have no fear of that, old woman," he said. "I\'m only going to put you\r\nout and take your house."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s The Last Brave Invader, by Charles L. Fontenay\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
