Fog or no fog, the airlines should stay on\r\nschedule. Lack of planning, foresight, sense of responsibility--that\r\nwas the trouble. He felt like cursing.\r\n\r\n"Damn!" 

=== Chunk 2 ===
said Mr. Bradbury.\r\n\r\nBut a voice on the public address system announced that Flight Eighteen\r\nfor Chicago was ready to leave. He raised his considerable bulk from\r\nthe chair in the dimly lit waiting room of the airfield and checked\r\nhis watch. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
No way to run a business. He shook his head and snorted\r\nindignantly.\r\n\r\nSuch a snort is worthy of note. It was an utterance that could be\r\nmade only by a corporation lawyer in the prime of life. It was a\r\nnasal explosion connoting wealth, confidence, and a singular lack of\r\nimagination. It was a snort fed on T-bone steaks, good Scotch whisky,\r\nand bicarbonate of soda.\r\n\r\nMr. Bradbury peered myopically around the waiting room. A few minutes\r\nago, while washing his face in the men\'s room, he had broken his\r\nglasses in the wash bowl. Although he hated to admit it to anyone, he\r\ncould see next to nothing without those thick lenses. The room was an\r\nunpleasant blur, but he was able to determine that he was the only\r\nwould-be passenger in the waiting room. The others were drinking coffee\r\nin the airfield\'s restaurant.\r\n\r\n"Flight Eighteen," said the voice on the speaker. "Flight Eighteen."\r\n\r\nMr. Bradbury shrugged his heavy shoulders, picked up his bag and\r\nbriefcase, and stepped out the door into the fog.\r\n\r\nThe mist hung thick and low over the airfield, cloaking the damp night\r\nair in a morbid blanket of gloom. Mr. Bradbury blinked sullenly into\r\nthe shroud-like vapor.\r\n\r\n"What the hell!" he swore. Can\'t even see the plane, and, he thought,\r\nfloundering unhappily into a wire gate where in blazes are the rest of\r\nthe passengers? Are they going to fly through this stuff?\r\n\r\n"This way, sir," said a feminine voice, and he saw a dim, uniformed\r\nfigure in front of him.\r\n\r\nThe hostess. Glad someone knows where he\'s going, he thought, and then\r\nhe followed the girl toward the now visible lights of the plane.\r\n\r\n"Watch your step, sir!" she said as he walked up the runway.\r\n\r\nHe grunted. Making these things steeper all the time, he thought.\r\n\r\nThe hostess was a pretty dark-eyed young thing, plump in the right sort\r\nof way. Mr. Bradbury leaned back in the soft, cushioned seat. It felt\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n"Fasten your safety belt, sir." She helped him with it.\r\n\r\n"And I do hope you\'ll be comfortable," she said in a soft, low voice.\r\nHe caught the glint of black eyes, jet and sparkling.\r\n\r\nHe smiled at her appreciatively. "I\'m sure I will," he grinned\r\nresisting a sudden impulse to pinch her cheek. The girl walked down the\r\naisle toward the door again, hips swaying provocatively.\r\n\r\nA young blossom ready for the plucking, thought Mr. Bradbury. A\r\nsucculent young partridge ready for the--Mr. Bradbury chuckled to\r\nhimself happily on thinking of the many women he had known in his fifty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nHe looked around the plane. No passengers, except for a pleasant\r\nlooking young man sitting across the aisle from him, a young man\r\nthoroughly engrossed in a small, paper-bound book, the title of which\r\nMr. Bradbury could not discern.\r\n\r\nHe wished he had his glasses, for he was getting a slight headache. The\r\nlawyer leaned back in the soft seat and closed his eyes. Well, headache\r\nor no headache, life was good, and he was glad he was alive. Then Mr.\r\nBradbury fell asleep.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke the plane was in flight, and looking out the window,\r\nhe could see nothing but darkness broken only by an occasional cloud\r\nformation. The man across the aisle was staring into the blackness\r\noutside, the book he had been reading discarded and left lying on the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nMr. Bradbury stretched himself and looked around him. The plane had\r\nbeen darkened and apparently only he and the young man were awake. He\r\nyawned. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
A great conversationalist, Mr. Bradbury craved discourse. But\r\nwhere was the opening wedge necessary to break the bond of silence\r\nbetween himself and the other passenger? Then his eyes fell on the book\r\nlying on the floor. He picked it up and held it close so that he could\r\nsee.\r\n\r\nThe title had something to do with "flying saucers" and the cover\r\nillustration, a lurid affair, showed a green-skinned, globe-headed,\r\ntentacled creature equipped with a tiny rocket motor on its back, an\r\nexpression of what was supposed to pass for lust in its face. The\r\nthing was carrying away a beautiful, thinly clad earthgirl, her face\r\ncontorted with fear. In the background hung a disc-shaped spaceship\r\nhovering over a burning earth city.\r\n\r\n"Rubbish!" said Mr. Bradbury in a loud voice so that the young man\r\nacross the aisle could hear him.\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon?" asked the other passenger, turning away from the\r\nwindow, eyebrows raised in question.\r\n\r\n"The book you\'re reading," answered the corporation lawyer. "Rubbish!"\r\n\r\nThe smooth-faced young man blushed and smiled apologetically. "Well, I\r\nsuppose you\'re right, but it\'s sort of fun, you know, reading this sort\r\nof thing."\r\n\r\nThe lawyer chuckled condescendingly and shook his head. He turned the\r\nbook over in his hands almost fondly. He wished he had his glasses so\r\nthat he could read it.\r\n\r\n"It\'s sort of refreshing, if you know what I mean," continued the man\r\nas if feeling some further defense of his choice in literature were\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n"Rubbish!" chuckled Mr. Bradbury for the third time.\r\n\r\nA shadow of annoyance registered on the young man\'s face.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer put down the book and extended his hand across the aisle.\r\n"Bradbury is the name," he said. "Represent the Hotchkiss Oil\r\nIndustries. Oil is my business!" he added impressively.\r\n\r\nThe young man hesitated for a moment and then accepted Mr. Bradbury\'s\r\nhand. The lawyer reflected momentarily that for a frail-looking young\r\nfellow the chap showed an amazing strength in his handshake.\r\n\r\n"Tarkas is my name," said Mr. Bradbury\'s new acquaintance. "Oswald\r\nTarkas."\r\n\r\n"In business, Mr. Tarkas?"\r\n\r\n"Well no," laughed Mr. Tarkas nervously, "not exactly. I suppose you\r\nmight say that I just sort of putter around. I work for a museum."\r\n\r\nMr. Bradbury frowned. He had never known anyone who just sort of\r\n"puttered around" in museums. He wasn\'t quite sure that he approved.\r\nSuch an occupation seemed vaguely un-American, subversive, although he\r\ncouldn\'t quite say why.\r\n\r\n"A museum? What museum?"\r\n\r\nOswald Tarkas hesitated, looked at the floor, and then answered almost\r\ntimidly as if he expected some reprimand.\r\n\r\n"Well, it\'s probably not too well known--the Canal City Museum."\r\n\r\n"Ummm!" muttered the lawyer. "No, can\'t say that I\'ve heard of it.\r\nWhere is it? New York? 

=== Chunk 5 ===
San Francisco?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOswald Tarkas had turned away for a moment and was staring out the\r\nwindow. The motors of the plane hummed pleasantly giving a sense of\r\ncomforting power. The plane\'s cabin was dark except for the lights over\r\nMr. Tarkas\' and Mr. Bradbury\'s seats.\r\n\r\n"Oh no!" replied Mr. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Tarkas. "We do have our branches in those cities,\r\nbut it\'s a bit difficult to pin us down. We\'re more or less a research\r\noutfit. Sort of an international organization, if you know what I mean."\r\n\r\nMr. Bradbury didn\'t, but he nodded his head agreeably. "And what do you\r\ndo for the museum, Tarkas?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m what you might call a collector--of sorts," he added. "Yes,\r\nI sort of collect things in a way--you might say."\r\n\r\nThe lawyer, a great student of human character noted that his new\r\nacquaintance wore a crew cut. His face was thin and looked clean-cut\r\nexcept for a slight weakness around the chin.\r\n\r\n"Well now, Oswald," he said, "you don\'t mind my calling you Oswald, do\r\nyou? I like to be friendly.

=== Chunk 7 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Not at all," flushed Mr. Tarkas happily. "I like to be friendly too.\r\nWhen my work permits," he added.\r\n\r\n"I have a lot of respect for museums," ventured Mr. Bradbury. He had\r\nnever been in a museum. "Cultural institutions, that sort of thing,"\r\nhe went on waving his hand. "My company often makes contributions to\r\nworthy institutions. Maybe I can do something for your outfit."\r\n\r\nOswald Tarkas seemed appreciative. "Now that\'s awfully kind, and, you\r\nknow, we accept all contributions gratefully. We take what we can get."\r\n\r\nThere was an embarrassed pause in the conversation. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
Then Mr. Bradbury\r\nremembered the book he held in his hand.\r\n\r\n"This book!" he said holding it up in his hand. "Nonsense!" he scoffed\r\nshaking his head. "Know what the flying saucers really were?"\r\n\r\n"Well--" started Oswald.\r\n\r\n"Balloons!"\r\n\r\n"Balloons?"\r\n\r\n"Weather balloons!" assured Mr. Bradbury emphatically. "Weather\r\nballoons! That\'s all they were!

=== Chunk 9 ===
"\r\n\r\nOswald looked as if he were about to say something, but didn\'t.\r\n\r\nMr. Bradbury, obviously enjoying himself, drew two expensive cigars\r\nfrom his coat pocket.\r\n\r\n"Have one?" he offered.\r\n\r\nOswald hesitated and then accepted. He put the cigar in his breast\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n"But," stammered Oswald. "What about the witnesses? The National Guard\r\npilot, the airliner pilots, the army anti-aircraft observers?"\r\n\r\nThe lawyer drew in the rich tobacco fumes, and tilted his large,\r\nhandsome head.\r\n\r\n"Hallucinations!" he said. "Mass hysteria!" A smile of amused\r\nindulgence lit his large, florid face. "Oh, oh, what a world of\r\nfantastic notions was begun by that first atomic explosion. Now,\r\nfor example, the notion that these so-called "flying saucers" are\r\nextra-terrestrial." Mr. Bradbury waved the very idea away with a\r\ngesture of dismissal. "If there are intelligent beings from another\r\nplanet in control of these hypothetical spaceships, why haven\'t they\r\ncontacted us by this time?"\r\n\r\n"Well," suggested Mr. Tarkas thoughtfully, "maybe they have their\r\nreasons. Maybe you can\'t judge the actions of extra-terrestrial beings\r\nby terrestrial standards of conduct."\r\n\r\n"And the meteors," continued Mr. Bradbury ignoring Oswald\'s last\r\nremark. "The meteors make space travel impossible. Do you realize that\r\nevery day our atmosphere is burning up thousands of those meteors? Do\r\nyou know that just one of those meteors the size of a pea could smash\r\nright through the thickest armored plate and wreck any rocket?"\r\n\r\nSomething small and glowing smashed into the outside of Mr. Bradbury\'s\r\nwindow and ricocheted off into space.\r\n\r\n"What was that?" asked Mr. Bradbury half rising from his seat.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," answered Oswald. And then he added jokingly, "Maybe it\r\nwas a meteor."\r\n\r\nThe lawyer stared out the window, but still he could see nothing but\r\nblackness. He settled back into his seat again, shrugging his shoulders.\r\n\r\n"Well now," he resumed, "as I said. The meteors. Can\'t escape them."\r\n\r\n"But," suggested Mr. Tarkas defensively. "Couldn\'t the rocket sort\r\nof \'scoot\' around them?" He simpered as if embarrassed by such a\r\nridiculous notion and made a half-hearted gesture with his right hand\r\nthat Mr. Bradbury assumed was a "scooting motion."\r\n\r\nMr. Bradbury dismissed this contention with a wave of his cigar.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJust then the airliner gave a sickening lurch to the right and\r\nsomething big and luminous roared past the plane. Mr. Bradbury\r\nbellowed. "Roughest damned trip I\'ve ever had."\r\n\r\n"It makes me nervous, too," said Oswald.\r\n\r\n"Now another thing," said the lawyer. "This business about men from\r\nMars."\r\n\r\nHe looked uneasily out his window.\r\n\r\nOswald smiled. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
"No truth in it?"\r\n\r\n"None! Anyone with even a token knowledge of science knows that the\r\nEarth is the only planet that can support human life."\r\n\r\n"But," answered Oswald, "suppose that planets could be inhabited by\r\nsomething other than human life. Like that thing on the cover there.

=== Chunk 11 ===
"\r\nHe motioned toward the book Mr. Bradbury held.\r\n\r\nMr. Bradbury laughed, about to explode this fallacy with another\r\nbarrage of devastating logic. He was interrupted.\r\n\r\n"Say, Brad. 

=== Chunk 12 ===
You don\'t mind my calling you Brad, do you?"\r\n\r\n"Of course not," smiled the lawyer affably.\r\n\r\n"You say there\'s no such thing as flying saucers?"\r\n\r\nMr. Bradbury inhaled from his cigar and shook his head.\r\n"Hallucinations," he said positively.\r\n\r\n"You\'re sure of that?"\r\n\r\n"Stake my life on it!"\r\n\r\n"Well I\'m sure glad of that because for a long time now the damndest\r\nhallucination I\'ve ever seen has been flying alongside of us."\r\n\r\nMr. Bradbury rose from his seat, stepped across the aisle, and looked\r\nout Mr. Tarkas\' window. He squinted out into the darkness. It was there\r\nall right. No wings, disc shaped, rows of lighted windows, luminous\r\nvapor emanating from the rear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: He could see the flying disc outside the window.]\r\n\r\n"Damn!" exclaimed Mr. Bradbury and pressed the button for the\r\nstewardess.\r\n\r\nShe came quickly down the darkened aisle.\r\n\r\n"Flight Eighteen!" she said blankly. "Flight Eighteen!"\r\n\r\nMr. Bradbury stared.\r\n\r\n"Did you ring, sir?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Good Lord yes!" said the lawyer. "Look!" He pointed to the window.\r\n\r\nThe stewardess, plump and pretty as ever, didn\'t look, but with amazing\r\nstrength pushed him down into his seat.\r\n\r\n"This way sir," she said smiling pleasantly.\r\n\r\n"What\'s going on?" roared Mr. Bradbury starting to rise again from his\r\nseat.\r\n\r\n"Watch your step, sir," answered the stewardess giving him another\r\nshove. "Fasten your safety belt, sir," she said, and before the lawyer\r\ncould protest again, he found himself fastened down in his seat.\r\n\r\n"And I do hope you\'ll be comfortable, sir," she said in a soft, low\r\nvoice. He caught the glint of black eyes, jet and sparkling. She\r\nturned, took one step up the aisle and stopped.\r\n\r\n"And I do hope you\'ll be comfortable, sir," she repeated. She stood\r\nthere motionless, as if paralyzed in the middle of the aisle.\r\n\r\n"And I do hope you\'ll be comfortable, sir," she said again. "And I do\r\nhope you\'ll be--"\r\n\r\nMr. Tarkas stifled a yawn, rose from his seat, and stepped over to\r\nthe girl. He reached out and twisted her ear. Her voice stopped and\r\nher back slid open like a secret panel, revealing a maze of whirring,\r\nclicking machinery.\r\n\r\n"What--what--" stuttered Mr. Bradbury. "She\'s a--"\r\n\r\n"A robot," smiled Oswald Tarkas happily. He turned from his examination\r\nof the defective machinery. "She\'s not a very good robot. Her vocal\r\nmechanism jams now and then, but she serves the purpose. 

=== Chunk 13 ===
You\'d be\r\nsurprised how many of you we catch this way."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen Oswald touched a wall switch. The darkened plane blazed into\r\nlight. There were no passengers on the plane other than Oswald, Mr.\r\nBradbury, and the robot stewardess that stood silently in the aisle.\r\n\r\nMr. Bradbury could still see the flying disc outside the window. Oswald\r\nsaw the direction of his glance.\r\n\r\n"Friend of mine," he grinned.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer looked wildly around the empty plane. "Where--where are the\r\npassengers?" he croaked, a numbing suspicion growing in his mind.\r\n\r\n"No other passengers," answered Oswald standing there, still smiling.\r\n"You just got in the wrong boat, Brad, old fellow."\r\n\r\nThe cabin of the airliner was changing. It was beginning to look like\r\nsomething very unlike an airliner cabin. The seats dissolved into\r\nwalls which seemed to expand in the shape of a circular room, a large\r\ndisc-shaped compartment lined with machinery, tanks and dials, glass\r\ncages of sleeping terrestrial animals. One large cage was empty. Mr.\r\nBradbury stared at this unoccupied glass cylinder.\r\n\r\n"Yes," grinned Oswald, "for you! But don\'t worry. 

=== Chunk 14 ===
Just pass it all off\r\nas a hallucination. Want to see where we are, Sport?"\r\n\r\nA panel opened in the floor, and Mr. Bradbury looked out into the black\r\nvoid of outer space. And there in the center of that panel of darkness\r\nwas the planet Earth, a tiny silver ball rapidly diminishing in size.\r\n\r\n"What are you?" screamed Mr. Bradbury struggling against the belt that\r\nheld him in his seat. "What are you?"\r\n\r\n"A collector," said Oswald Tarkas tearing off his head and revealing\r\nunderneath the disguise a small globe of bone and flesh, two glowing\r\neyes, a mouth filled with many white, sharp teeth. "A collector,"\r\nit repeated as the false arms and legs and torso were ripped away\r\nrevealing a shapeless green body equipped with spindly tentacles that\r\nwaved obscenely at Mr. Bradbury. "Of sorts," it added as it moved\r\ntoward the frightened lawyer.\r\n\r\nMr. Bradbury screamed.\r\n\r\n"Rubbish," it giggled. "Weather balloons, hallucinations," it chirped\r\ngaily, and writhing, snakelike appendages reached out for the twisting,\r\nscreaming hysterical figure of Mr. Bradbury.\r\n\r\nAnd through the empty reaches of the cosmos two tiny discs hurtled\r\ntoward Sol\'s fourth planet.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
