=== Chunk 2 ===
Angstrom was known to his students and many of his colleagues on\r\nthe faculty as "The Old Goat." Very appropriate, that name. He had the\r\ndisposition of a goat with dyspepsia, he had the cold blue eyes of a\r\ngoat, he had the waggling whiskers of a goat. Perhaps it\'s in memory of\r\nDr. Angstrom that Ivy College has a goat for its mascot now.\r\n\r\nDr. Angstrom was even more goatish than usual that day last summer when\r\nhalf a dozen top scientists in the field gathered to see his preview\r\nexperiment on matter transmission of a live animal. He had been working\r\nhard for weeks on the transmitter and keeping up classes at the same\r\ntime, which did not improve his disposition. Besides, he had a real\r\ngoat for an experimental animal, and goats are notoriously hard on the\r\nnervous system.\r\n\r\nThis particular animal, at the moment the scientists entered, was\r\nstraining at his rope, trying to get a mouthful of a tablecloth which\r\ngraced a nearby table full of jars and retorts. Failing this, the goat\r\nexhibited that typical lack of discrimination in matters edible and\r\nbegan to chew on his rope.\r\n\r\nI felt a little out of place among all these giant brains. My reason\r\nfor being there was that I had been serving, during my college career,\r\nas sort of a factotum and fetch-and-carry man for Dr. Angstrom, and\r\nI was to take notes for him. I had acquired considerable affection\r\nfor The Old Goat. Maybe that\'s one reason I hate to see his great\r\nscientific work kept under wraps because people still insist it\'s\r\ndangerous.\r\n\r\n"I have proved to my own satisfaction that the matter transmitter\r\nworks," Dr. Angstrom told the assembled scientists. "I have made a\r\nnumber of transmissions of inanimate matter. In theory, it should work\r\njust as well for animate objects and I have invited you to be present\r\nat the first test of this theory.\r\n\r\n"I need not go into detail with you about the basic theory of matter\r\ntransmission. The transmitter itself picks up the atomic and\r\nelectronic \'image\' of the object inside it, much as a television\r\nscanner picks up a scene, except that it is done in three dimensions\r\ninstead of two. This is made possible by the four-dimensional element\r\nwhich is the heart of the apparatus and was made available to us\r\nthrough recent intra-atomic research.\r\n\r\n"The receiver picks up the image as a television receiver does, except\r\nagain in three dimensions. The matter is not duplicated because the\r\ntransmitter strips down the object within it as it transmits.\r\n\r\n"Now the question that has been raised by some scientists about the\r\ntransmission of animate objects is whether the \'soul\' or \'life force\'\r\ncan be transmitted. I consider this question ridiculous, and will prove\r\nit so. It is my contention that such \'life force\' is not a thing apart\r\nfrom the physical shell."\r\n\r\nThe matter transmitter was a large closed cylinder on one side of the\r\nroom. The receiver was a similar cylinder on the other. Both were\r\nraised slightly from the floor.\r\n\r\nAs sort of _hors d\'oeuvre_, Dr. Angstrom transmitted a large chunk of\r\nlead across the room, then a glass jar. In each case, the object was\r\nplaced in the transmitter and a moment later removed from the receiver\r\nacross the room. There was no possible way for it to have been moved\r\nacross the intervening space except by broadcast transmission.\r\n\r\n"As you see," said Dr. Angstrom, "I have eliminated the necessity for\r\na switch by building the switch into the door of the transmitter. As\r\nsoon as the door is closed, transmission occurs.

Now we shall send our\r\nanimate object."\r\n\r\nHe untied the goat and, with some difficulty, hauled the animal by its\r\ncollar to the transmitter. There the goat balked and Dr. Angstrom,\r\nhaving got its head through the door, got behind it and shoved\r\nheartily, hanging onto the edge of the door so he could shut it quickly\r\nwhen the goat was inside.\r\n\r\nAs goats will, the goat suddenly changed its mind and leaped into the\r\ntransmitter. Caught off balance, Dr. Angstrom fell in after it--and the\r\ndoor, given a last frantic jerk, slammed on them both.\r\n\r\nThere were gasps of horror and alarm from the scientists, but I held\r\nup my hand to calm them.\r\n\r\n"There\'s no danger, gentlemen," I said. "It\'s just as well this way. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
I\r\nhappen to know that Dr. Angstrom\'s next step, after proving to you with\r\nthe goat that animate objects could be transmitted, was to prove that\r\nhuman beings also could be transmitted. He planned to be his own first\r\nsubject."\r\n\r\nWith serene confidence, I went to the receiver and threw open the door.\r\nJust as I had anticipated, the goat leaped out, unharmed, followed by\r\nDr. Angstrom.\r\n\r\n"I told you animate objects could be transmitted successfully," said\r\nthe goat triumphantly.\r\n\r\n"Baa!" said Dr. Angstrom, and began eating the tablecloth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
