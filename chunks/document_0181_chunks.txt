KALLIS, JR.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustrated by Douglas\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_"You can see it--you can watch it--but mustn\'t touch!" And what could\r\npossibly be more frustrating ... when you need, most violently, to get\r\nyour hands on it for just one second...._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe man finally entered the office of General George Garvers. As the\r\ndoor closed behind him, he saw the general, who sprang from his chair to\r\ngreet him.\r\n\r\n"Max! You finally came."\r\n\r\n"Got here as soon as I could. I wager half my time was taken up by the\r\nsecurity check points. You are certainly isolated in here."\r\n\r\n"All of that," agreed the general. "Have a seat, won\'t you?" he asked,\r\nindicating a chair.\r\n\r\nHis friend sank into it gratefully. "Now, what\'s this vital problem you\r\ncalled me about? 

=== Chunk 2 ===
You weren\'t too specific."\r\n\r\n"No," said Garvers, "I wasn\'t. This is a security matter, after a\r\nfashion. It\'s vitally important that we get technical help on this\r\nthing, and since you and I are friends, I was asked to call you in."\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid I\'ll have to make a story of it."\r\n\r\n"Quite all right by me, but don\'t mind if I interject a question now and\r\nthen. Mind if I smoke?"\r\n\r\n"Go right ahead," said Garvers, fumbling out a lighter. "Just don\'t\r\nspill ashes on the rug.\r\n\r\n"This all began on the Third of May. I was working here on some\r\ntop-security stuff. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
I had suddenly got the feeling of being watched. I\r\nknow it seems silly, what with all the check points that a potential spy\r\nwould have to go through to get here, but that\'s just how I felt.\r\n\r\n"Several times I glanced around the office, but of course it was empty.\r\nThen I began to think that it was my nerves."\r\n\r\n"You always were a bit of a hypochondriac," observed his friend.\r\n\r\n"Be that as it may," continued Garvers, "it was the only explanation I\r\nhad at the time. Either someone was watching me, which seemed\r\nimpossible, or I was beginning to crack under the strain.\r\n\r\n"Well, I put my papers away and tried to take a short break. I was\r\nreaching into my drawer where I keep magazines when, so help me, a man\r\nstepped out of the wall into my office."\r\n\r\n"What? It seems as if you just said a guy stepped out of the wall."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just what I did say. It sounds crazy, but let me finish, will\r\nyou? I\'m not kidding, and I\'ll show you proof later if necessary.\r\n\r\n"Anyway, this bird stepped straight out of the wall as if it had been a\r\nwaterfall or something, but the wall itself was undamaged. The only\r\nproof I had that he had actually done it was the fact that he was in my\r\noffice, but that was proof enough.\r\n\r\n"To put it mildly, I was thunderstruck. After jumping to my feet, I\r\ncould only stand there like an idiot. I was so shaken that I couldn\'t\r\nspeak a word. But he spoke first.\r\n\r\n"\'General Garvers?\' he asked, just as if he had run into me at a\r\ncocktail party or on the street.\r\n\r\n"I told him he was correct, and asked him who _he_ was and what he\r\nwanted. And how he got into my office.\r\n\r\n"He identified himself as a Henry Busch and explained that he was acting\r\nin behalf of a good friend of his, the late Dr. Hymann Duvall. Have you\r\never heard of Duvall, Max?"\r\n\r\nHis friend twisted his face in thought. "Can\'t say that I have,\r\noff-hand. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
But the name seems to ring a bell somewhere."\r\n\r\n"Well, anyway, he said that Duvall had perfected an invention of great\r\nnational importance shortly before his death and asked Busch to deliver\r\nit to the government if anything should happen to him. Then Duvall died\r\nsuddenly of a heart attack."\r\n\r\n"And what was this invention?"\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it obvious? A machine that would enable a man to walk through\r\nwalls. And Busch has no idea how the thing works, other than the general\r\nexplanation that Duvall gave him. And Busch was poles apart from Duvall.\r\nThey were friends from college, but not because of professional\r\ninterests. It seems they were both doublecrossed by the same girl.\r\n\r\n"Duvall was a brilliant but obscure nuclear and radiation physicist. He\r\nwas one of those once-in-a-lifetime fellows like Tesla. He was so shy\r\nthat he didn\'t bring himself to anybody\'s attention, save for a few\r\npapers he published in the smaller physical societies\' magazines. It was\r\nonly because he had inherited a considerable amount of money that he\r\ncould do any research whatsoever."\r\n\r\n"Hm-m-m. I seem to remember a paper about wave propagation in one of the\r\nquarterlies. Quite unorthodox, as I recall," said Max.\r\n\r\n"Could be. But anyway, about Busch.\r\n\r\n"Busch majored in psychology at college, but took special courses after\r\nhe graduated and took a Master\'s in English. He has written two novels\r\nand three collections of poems under various pen names. At the time of\r\nDuvall\'s death, he was working on the libretto of an opera. He has had\r\nno technical training, unless you want to count a year of high school\r\ngeneral science. So he wasn\'t too much help in explaining how Duvall\'s\r\ninstrument works.\r\n\r\n"And, just to make matters more juicy, Duvall kept no notes. He had\r\ntotal recall and a childlike fear of putting anything into writing that\r\nhad not been experimentally verified."\r\n\r\n"And this machine, how is it supposed to work?"\r\n\r\n\r\nGarvers got up and began to pace. "According to Busch, Duvall devised\r\nthe instrument after stumbling into an entirely new branch of physics.\r\n\r\n"This device of Duvall\'s is a special case of a new theory of matter and\r\nenergy. Matter is made up of subnuclear particles--electrons, protons\r\nand the like. However, Duvall said that these particles are in turn made\r\nup of much smaller particles grouped together in aggregate clouds. The\r\nsize ratio of these particles to protons is somewhat like the ratio of\r\nan individual proton to a large star. They seem to be composed of tiny\r\nclots of energy from a fantastically complex energy system, in which\r\nelectromagnetism is but a small part. Each energy-segment is represented\r\nby a different facet of each particle, and the arrangement of the\r\nindividual particles to each other determines what super-particle they\r\nwill form, such as an electron. Duvall called these sub-particles\r\n\'lems\'.\r\n\r\n"Busch says he was told that a field of a special nature could be\r\ngenerated so as to make the individual lems in the particles of matter\r\nrotate in a special way that would introduce a \'polarization field\', as\r\nDuvall called it. This field seems to be connected somehow with gravity,\r\nbut Busch wasn\'t told how.\r\n\r\n"The upshot is that matter in the _initial_ presence of the field is\r\naffected so that it is able to pass through ordinary matter--"\r\n\r\n"Hold on," interrupted Max. "If a device can do that, then the user\r\nwould immediately fall towards the center of the Earth."\r\n\r\n"Just _you_ hold on. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
You didn\'t let me finish. A single plane of atoms,\r\nat the base of the treated object is the point of contact. It remains\r\npartially unaffected because it is closest to the \'gravetostatic field\r\ncenter\', which I guess is the Earth\'s center of attraction. This plane\r\nof \'semi-treated\' atoms can be forced through an object, if it is moved\r\nhorizontally, but its \'untreated\' aspect prevents the subject wearing\r\nthe device from falling through the floor.\r\n\r\n"Busch demonstrated this device to me, turning it on and strolling\r\nthrough various objects in this room. Think of it! 

=== Chunk 6 ===
No soldier could be\r\nkilled or held prisoner. And--"\r\n\r\n"Now hang on," objected Max. "Let\'s not run away with ourselves. He may\r\nhave perfected a device that would enable a soldier to avoid capture,\r\nbut there would certainly be other ways to kill him than by bullets.\r\nLet\'s see now: suppose that the enemy shot a flamethrower at him. The\r\nburning materials might pass through him, but he would be cooked anyway.\r\nOr poison gas--"\r\n\r\n"Hm-m-m. As far as gas goes, I suppose a gas mask would be necessary.\r\nBusch doesn\'t know about the breathing mechanism, except that he had to\r\ntake breaths. But as far as fire or radiation goes, the man\'s protected.\r\nIf the radiation is either harmful by nature or by amount, the field\r\nmerely reflects it. It is something called the \'lemic stress\' of the\r\nfield that causes the phenomenon.\r\n\r\n"That\'s why we need your help."\r\n\r\nMax scratched his head thoughtfully. "I don\'t understand.

=== Chunk 7 ===
"\r\n\r\nGarvers looked pained. "When Busch had finished his demonstration, he\r\ncarelessly tossed the device on my desk. The thing skidded and hit my\r\npaperweight so that the switch was thrown on again. So now the device\r\nand my desk are both untouchable.\r\n\r\n"Go over to the desk and try to touch it," said Garvers dryly.\r\n\r\nHis friend got up and ambled over to the desk. There he saw a small\r\nblack box resting near a paperweight. Its toggle switch was at the "on"\r\nposition, and it was lying on its side. He tried to pick the box up, but\r\nhis hand slid effortlessly through it as if it were so much air.\r\n\r\n"_Well_!" Max said. He passed his hand through the desk again. "Well,\r\nwell. Are you sure Busch told you everything?"\r\n\r\n"Busch! He honestly wants to help and we have taken him through the\r\nmill. Pentathol, scopolamine and the like; hypnotism and the polygraph.\r\nWe\'ve dug that man deeper than we have ever dug anybody before."\r\n\r\n"And have you conducted any experiments of your own?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly. That\'s what is so frustrating. We try to X ray the thing,\r\nand we don\'t get a thing. We bombarded it with every radiation we could\r\nthink of, from radio to gamma and it just reflected them. We can detect\r\nno radiation coming out of it. Magnetic fields don\'t effect it, nor do\r\nheat and cold. Nuclear particles are ignored by it; it just _sits_ there\r\nthumbing its nose at us. And we can\'t even wait for it to run down.\r\nAccording to Busch, the power requirements of the thing are funny and\r\nonce the field is established, it takes no additional energy to maintain\r\nit. And the collapsing power remains indefinitely until it is time to\r\nturn the machine off, but it\'s unreachable by any means we have.\r\n\r\n"It\'s pure frustration. There\'s no way we can analyze it until we can\r\nhandle it, and no way we can handle it until we can turn it off. And\r\nthere\'s no way we can turn it off until we have analyzed it. If it were\r\nalive, I\'d think that it was laughing at us.\r\n\r\n"Do _you_ have any ideas?" asked Garvers hopefully.\r\n\r\n"Nothing that would help a solution at present," said Max. "But do you\r\nremember the legend of King Tantalus?"\r\n\r\n"Slightly. What about it?"\r\n\r\n"Well ... if _he_ were here," said Max thoughtfully, "he\'d ...\r\nsympathize."\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
