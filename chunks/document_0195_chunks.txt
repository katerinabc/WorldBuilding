]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy me? Why, out of 300 billion people on earth, why did they have to\r\npick on _me_?\r\n\r\nAnd if it had to happen, why couldn\'t it have happened before I met\r\nBetty and fell in love with her? You see, Betty and I were to be\r\nmarried tomorrow. We _were_ to have been married. Tomorrow.\r\n\r\nTomorrow, indeed! What a ghastly thought that is! How can I explain\r\nto Betty--to anyone! I can\'t face her, and what could I say on the\r\ntelephone? "Sorry, Betty, I can\'t marry you. I\'m no longer--quite\r\nhuman."\r\n\r\nQuit joking, Kelley! This is for real. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
You\'re sober and awake and it\r\ndid happen. Marrying Betty is out of the question even if she\'d have\r\nyou the way you are. You\'re not _that_ two-faced!\r\n\r\nQuit standing in front of the mirror, naked and shaking, looking\r\nfor scars, counting your fingers and toes. You\'ve taken a hundred\r\ninventories, and it always comes out wrong. And it always will,\r\nunless ... unless _they_ come back. But that\'s hopeless. They\'d never\r\nfind me again. Not out of all the people on earth. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Besides, they\r\ndidn\'t seem to give a damn. No more than a kid gives a damn what\r\nhappens to a lump of modelling clay when he gets bored squeezing it\r\ninto this shape and that.\r\n\r\nWhere did they come from? Or, judging from their "talk," _when_ did\r\nthey come from? And would it do me any good if I knew?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI was sitting there in my bachelor apartment, drinking a can of\r\nbeer and trying to work a crossword puzzle to get sleepy. I wasn\'t\r\nespecially jittery like the groom is always supposed to be on the eve\r\nof his wedding. Just wide awake at midnight, wanting to get sleepy so I\r\ncould get some real rest when I went to bed.\r\n\r\nJust sitting there trying to think of a two-letter word for "sun-god."\r\nAnd that made me think of the gold in Betty\'s hair when the sun was on\r\nit at the beach. And pretty soon I was just staring into space, aching\r\nfor Betty, wishing the next twelve hours of my life would vanish and we\r\ncould be together, heading for our little cottage at the lake.\r\n\r\nStaring into space.... Then it wasn\'t just space. There were these two\r\nbig ball bearings in front of me, about three feet in diameter, if you\r\ncould say they had a diameter. They looked like ball bearings because\r\ntheir surfaces were shiny, mirrorlike steel. But they had unevenly\r\nspaced, smooth bumps. Something like the random knobs on a potato, so\r\nthey weren\'t really round at all.\r\n\r\nThe light from my lamp reflected crazily, and my own image gaped back\r\nat me from their distorted, reflecting curves. Like the fun-mirrors at\r\nthe crazy-house, only crazier ... and not funny at all. Fear is never\r\nfunny. And I was afraid. I\'ll swear I could _taste_ the terror. It was\r\nsalty on my tongue. When I tried to cry out, the roof of my mouth felt\r\nlike old concrete.\r\n\r\nThen one of them spoke. "It\'s alive! Intelligent! It senses our\r\npresence!"\r\n\r\nI was receiving pure thought, not words. But man thinks only in words.\r\nAnd their thoughts fished suitable words from my subconscious to frame\r\nthem for my assimilation.\r\n\r\nTelepathy? Impossible! What common points of reference could I have\r\nwith these two unthinkably alien life-forms?\r\n\r\nThe answer whipped back at me on an intuitive, sub-vocal level: Thought\r\nis a universal energy manifestation. _Language is only the clumsy\r\nvehicle for thought._\r\n\r\nBetween me and the aliens lay no such barrier.\r\n\r\n"Obviously intelligent," the other agreed. "Feel those gamma\r\nradiations? Too bad they\'re so weak. It would be interesting if he\r\ncould communicate with us."\r\n\r\nI stammered aloud, "But--but I _can_ communicate with you. I understand\r\nevery--"\r\n\r\nThey were paying no attention to my raspy words. "Yes, that\'s typical\r\nof these ancient, organic life-forms. As I recall, they use some form\r\nof physical vibration of their gaseous medium for communicating among\r\nthemselves--"\r\n\r\n"Speaking of which," the other interrupted, "this particular gaseous\r\nmedium seems to contain oxygen. We\'d best not remain overlong or we\'ll\r\ncorrode and catch hell when we return.

=== Chunk 5 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Exude a little nickel if it irritates you. We\'ll catch hell anyway\r\nwhen mother--"\r\n\r\nYes, that\'s the word that came to me!\r\n\r\n"--discovers _when_ we\'ve been. I\'m curious about these flesh and blood\r\ncreatures. I wonder who invented this clumsy monstrosity."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe meant me. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
He rolled a foot nearer, and the other followed with an\r\nuncertain wobble. "I turned out better in the third grade."\r\n\r\n"Liar! You nearly flunked meta-plastics."\r\n\r\n"Well, you did flunk it, so who are you to--?"\r\n\r\n"Just don\'t be over-critical. I think this one looks fairly practical.\r\nWell-balanced--"\r\n\r\n"That\'s just what I mean. Observe the unimaginative bisymmetry. Two\r\narms, two legs, two eyes, five fingers on each hand, five toes on each\r\nfoot. Surely, the inventor was a mechanic and no artist. In this light\r\ngravity there was no need for--"\r\n\r\n"And how would you improve the design, your high-and-mightiness?

=== Chunk 7 ===
"\r\n\r\n"First let\'s remove the covering."\r\n\r\nMy clothes left my body gently, but with the sound of violent tearing.\r\nIn two seconds I sat naked, my garments laid back like split bandages.\r\n\r\nI shouted, "See here, for God\'s sakes!"\r\n\r\nThe aliens had made no visible move, yet they had wielded powerful\r\nforces to strip everything I wore from my body, shirt, slacks,\r\nunderwear and even my shoes ... without so much as pinching my flesh.\r\n\r\nI leaped to my feet naked as a straw. They were between me and the\r\ndoor, but they seemed so clumsy.\r\n\r\n"Watch it! He\'s alarmed. Don\'t let him escape!"\r\n\r\n"Try and stop me!" I screamed, tensing my muscles for a leap over the\r\npair of intruders. Suddenly the air about my sweating body seemed to\r\nthicken to the viscosity of molasses. I could breathe it all right, but\r\nquick motion was denied me. My grand leap died before my right foot\r\nleft the floor. I retreated to my chair in slow-motion panic, sinking\r\nslowly through the clabbered atmosphere, to a sitting position on my\r\ntorn clothing.\r\n\r\n"Yes, a very clumsy, unesthetic life-form. In fact the bisymmetry\r\nfairly nauseates me. Granted that the two arms are practical, doubtless\r\none or the other does 90% of all work. So why have them of equal\r\nimportance? See here, I\'ll demonstrate...."\r\n\r\n"Wait!" the other cautioned. "This is a sentient creature. You can\'t\r\noperate without...."\r\n\r\n"Of course not!"\r\n\r\nSomething buzzed in my spine, and I blanked out. For the space of one\r\nbreath, it seemed.\r\n\r\n"There, that\'s better."\r\n\r\n"I guess I must agree with you."\r\n\r\nA faint tingle in my left arm caused me to stare at it. Unbelievingly!\r\nIts length was the same, but its diameter was reduced to two-thirds,\r\nand there were two fingers missing on the hand. The opposable thumb\r\nremained, but it now had more the appearance of a claw than a human\r\nhand. I tried to scream, but the sound was a glutinous bubble of air\r\nthat never reached my lips.\r\n\r\n"How about the pedal appendages?"\r\n\r\n"Well--" there was some hesitation. "Considering the method of\r\nlocomotion, bisymmetry seems more justified there. However, why\r\nbilateral? Why not quadrilateral?"\r\n\r\n"Because the organs of sight face only one way."\r\n\r\n"I can fix that, too."\r\n\r\nMy spine buzzed, and when I looked down again a flood of peculiar\r\nchanges had taken place. My ankles terminated in the middle of my feet,\r\nand my heels had disappeared. In their place were toes.\r\n\r\n"You see, with the double-hinged knee-joint, he can travel forward or\r\nbackward now without pivoting...."\r\n\r\nThen I became aware that I could _look_ forward and backward at the\r\nsame time.\r\n\r\n"That thing in the middle is certainly superfluous."\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nBuzz!\r\n\r\nIt was gone.\r\n\r\n"A tentacle fastened, say, to the right hip-bone could be very useful."\r\n\r\nBuzz!\r\n\r\nMy right hip tingled. From it protruded a whip-like appendage some\r\neight feet long, brown and leathery, tapering to the diameter of a\r\npencil and terminating in a pink flesh-pad richly supplied with sensory\r\nbuds. I could feel every hair in the nap of the carpet on which it\r\nrested--feel, taste, smell and hear! Four sense organs in one!\r\n\r\n"Now we are making progress!" came the exclamation.\r\n\r\nBuzz! 

=== Chunk 8 ===
Buzz! Buzz!\r\n\r\nThe instant-seeming anesthetic moments came upon me in quick\r\nsuccession, and each left me bereft of some standard, human equipment\r\nor in the possession of some extra-normal addition to my anatomy--with\r\nno more sensation than the slight tingle I have mentioned.\r\n\r\nFrom their mental remarks I conclude that I lost my vermiform appendix,\r\ntonsils and a mole on my left shoulder blade. Most of the other items\r\nwhich I acquired were too grotesque to describe further.\r\n\r\n"The two additional cardiac structures and the adrenal adjustments\r\nshould assure some likelihood of immortality," one of the intruders was\r\nexplaining.\r\n\r\n"Which would probably bring about over-population in ten generations,"\r\nthe other reminded him.\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes. I should compensate for that.

=== Chunk 9 ===
"\r\n\r\nBuzz, and he did!\r\n\r\n"I\'m corroding."\r\n\r\n"Exude some chrome as I told you."\r\n\r\n"I think I hear mother calling, anyway. Let\'s go before she--"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey were too late. A third bumpy ball-bearing materialized behind the\r\ntwo aliens, and instantly a barrage of maternal scolding dominated the\r\nether. "I\'ve been searching the whole continuum for you two! What are\r\nyou doing back here?"\r\n\r\n"We were just about to return, Mother."\r\n\r\n"That\'s the truth, Mother. We just broke through here so we could\r\npractice our advanced--"\r\n\r\n"Practice!" Mother exclaimed. "Practice on this poor, primitive,\r\norganic creature?"\r\n\r\nI felt poor and primitive indeed. Paralyzed with fear, my only wonder\r\nnow was that apparently I had retained my sanity throughout this\r\nwaking nightmare.\r\n\r\n"We didn\'t hurt him."\r\n\r\n"You put him back the way you found him, do you understand? Do it right\r\nthis instant!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mother. Let\'s see, how _did_ we find him?"\r\n\r\n"Simple bilateral symmetry, stupid!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, two of everything except--"\r\n\r\n"Hold it! Remember the anaesthesia."\r\n\r\nBuzz!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen I awakened this time they were gone. My electric clock hummed\r\nsoftly on the mantle, revealing the nonsensical information that less\r\nthan an hour had passed since my visitors first arrived.\r\n\r\nI staggered to my feet, bracing myself against the thick air, but the\r\nair was just ordinary, thin, substanceless air again. My hand dropped\r\nto my right hip.\r\n\r\nThe tentacle was gone.\r\n\r\n"Thank God!" I breathed, and for an instant my common sense tried to\r\ninsist that I had merely fallen asleep for a few minutes and dreamed\r\nthe whole fantastic sequence.\r\n\r\nBut no! Why would I be stark naked? And why were my clothes lying\r\nruined in my chair like bandages split with a huge razor?\r\n\r\nI clenched my left fist and gained comfort from the reassuring pressure\r\nof four fingers and a thumb in my palm. But then I stepped into my\r\nbedroom and stood before my full-length mirror--where I have stood\r\nrooted ever since.\r\n\r\nAnd the question revolves in my brain, punctuated only by my profanity\r\nand sobs of despair. How can I marry Betty now? How can I face her, let\r\nalone marry her?\r\n\r\nWhat woman on earth could bring herself to marry a man with no\r\nnavel ... and two heads?\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
