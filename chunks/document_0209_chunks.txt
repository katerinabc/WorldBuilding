Lately, every little thing seemed to\r\nmake him irritable. He supposed it was because his drafting department\r\nwas behind schedule on the latest Defense contract. His ears were sore\r\nand his stomach writhed with dyspepsia, and his feet hurt.\r\n\r\nWalking through the clerical office usually made him feel better. The\r\nconstant clatter of typewriters and office machines gave him a sense\r\nof efficiency, of stability, an all-is-well-with-the-world feeling. He\r\nwaved to a few of the more familiar employees and smiled, but of course\r\nyou couldn\'t say hello with the continual racket.\r\n\r\nThis morning, somehow, it didn\'t make him feel better. He supposed it\r\nwas because of the song they were playing over the speakers, "Slam Bang\r\nBoom," the latest Top Hit. He hated that song.\r\n\r\nOf course the National Mental Health people said constant music had a\r\nbeneficial effect on office workers, so Joseph was no one to object,\r\neven though he did wonder if anyone could ever actually listen to it\r\nover the other noise.\r\n\r\nIn his own office the steady din was hardly diminished despite\r\nsoundproofing, and since he was next to an outside wall he was\r\nsubjected also to the noises of the city. He stood staring out of the\r\nhuge window for awhile, watching the cars on the freeway and listening\r\nto the homogeneous rumble and scream of turbines.\r\n\r\n_Something\'s wrong with me_, he thought. _I shouldn\'t be feeling this\r\nway. Nerves. Nerves._\r\n\r\nHe turned around and got his private secretary on the viewer. She\r\nsimpered at him, trying to be friendly with her dull, sunken eyes.\r\n\r\n"Betty," he told her, "I want you to make an appointment with my\r\ntherapist for me this afternoon. Tell him it\'s just a case of nerves,\r\nthough.

"\r\n\r\n"Yes sir. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Anything else?" Her voice, like every one\'s, was a high\r\npitched screech trying to be heard above the noise.\r\n\r\nJoseph winced. "Anybody want to see me this morning?

=== Chunk 4 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Well, Mr. Wills says he has the first model of his invention ready to\r\nshow you."\r\n\r\n"Let him in whenever he\'s ready. Otherwise, if nothing important comes\r\nup, I want you to leave me alone."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, certainly." She smiled again, a mechanical, automatic smile\r\nthat seemed to want to be something more.\r\n\r\nJoseph switched off.\r\n\r\n_That was a damn funny way of saying it_, he thought. _"I want you to\r\nleave me alone." As if somebody were after me._\r\n\r\nHe spent about an hour on routine paperwork and then Bob Wills showed\r\nup so Joseph switched off his dictograph and let him in.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid you\'ll have to make it brief, Bob," he grinned. "I\'ve a\r\nwhale of a lot of work to do, and I seem to be developing a splitting\r\nheadache. Nerves, you know."\r\n\r\n"Sure, Mister Partch. I won\'t take a minute; I just thought you\'d like\r\nto have a look at the first model of our widget and get clued in on our\r\nprogress so far...."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, just go ahead. How does the thing work?"\r\n\r\nBob smiled and set the grey steel chassis on Partch\'s desk, sat down in\r\nfront of it, and began tracing the wiring for Joseph.\r\n\r\nIt was an interesting problem, or at any rate should have been. It\r\nwas one that had been harassing cities, industry, and particularly\r\nair-fields, for many years. Of course, every one wore earplugs--and\r\nthat helped a little. And some firms had partially solved the problem\r\nby using personnel that were totally deaf, because such persons\r\nwere the only ones who could stand the terrific noise levels that a\r\ntechnological civilization forced everyone to endure. The noise from\r\na commercial rocket motor on the ground had been known to drive men\r\nmad, and sometimes kill them. There had never seemed to be any wholly\r\nsatisfactory solution.\r\n\r\nBut now Bob Wills apparently had the beginnings of a real answer. A\r\ndevice that would use the principle of interference to cancel out sound\r\nwaves, leaving behind only heat.\r\n\r\nIt should have been fascinating to Partch, but somehow he couldn\'t make\r\nhimself get interested in it.\r\n\r\n"The really big problem is the power requirement," Wills was saying.\r\n"We\'ve got to use a lot of energy to cancel out big sound waves, but\r\nwe\'ve got several possible answers in mind and we\'re working on all of\r\nthem."\r\n\r\nHe caressed the crackle-finish box fondly.\r\n\r\n"The basic gimmick works fine, though. Yesterday I took it down to a\r\nstatic test stand over in building 90 and had them turn on a pretty\r\nfair-sized steering rocket for one of the big moon-ships. Reduced the\r\nnoise-level by about 25 per cent, it did. Of course, I still needed my\r\nplugs."\r\n\r\nJoseph nodded approvingly and stared vacantly into the maze of\r\ntransistors and tubes.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve built it to work on ordinary 60 cycle house current," Wills told\r\nhim. "In case you should want to demonstrate it to anybody."\r\n\r\nPartch became brusque. He liked Bob, but he had work to do.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I probably shall, Bob. I tell you what, why don\'t you just leave\r\nit here in my office and I\'ll look it over later, hm?"\r\n\r\n"Okay, Mr. Partch."\r\n\r\nJoseph ushered him out of the office, complimenting him profusely on\r\nthe good work he was doing. Only after he was gone and Joseph was alone\r\nagain behind the closed door, did he realize that he had a sudden\r\nyearning for company, for someone to talk to.\r\n\r\n<tb>\r\n\r\nPartch had Betty send him in a light lunch and he sat behind his desk\r\nnibbling the tasteless stuff without much enthusiasm. He wondered if he\r\nwas getting an ulcer.\r\n\r\nYes, he decided, he was going to have to have a long talk with Dr.\r\nColes that afternoon. Be a pleasure to get it all off his chest, his\r\nfeeling of melancholia, his latent sense of doom. Be good just to talk\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\nOh, everything was getting to him these days. He was in a rut, that was\r\nit. A rut.\r\n\r\nHe spat a sesame seed against the far wall and the low whir of the\r\nautomatic vacuum cleaner rose and fell briefly.\r\n\r\nJoseph winced. The speakers were playing "Slam Bang Boom" again.\r\n\r\nHis mind turned away from the grating melody in self defense, to look\r\ninward on himself.\r\n\r\nOf what, after all, did Joseph Partch\'s life consist? He licked his\r\nfingers and thought about it.\r\n\r\nWhat would he do this evening after work, for instance?\r\n\r\nWhy, he\'d stuff his earplugs back in his inflamed ears and board the\r\ncommuter\'s copter and ride for half an hour listening to the drumming\r\nof the rotors and the pleading of the various canned commercials played\r\non the copter\'s speakers loud enough to be heard over the engine noise\r\nand through the plugs.\r\n\r\nAnd then when he got home, there would be the continuous yammer of his\r\nwife added to the Tri-Di set going full blast and the dull food from\r\nthe automatic kitchen. And synthetic coffee and one stale cigaret.\r\nPerhaps a glass of brandy to steady his nerves if Dr. Coles approved.\r\n\r\nPartch brooded. The sense of foreboding had been submerged in the day\'s\r\nwork, but it was still there. It was as if, any moment, a hydrogen\r\nbomb were going to be dropped down the chimney, and you had no way of\r\nknowing when.\r\n\r\nAnd what would there be to do after he had finished dinner that night?\r\nWhy, the same things he had been doing every night for the past fifteen\r\nyears. There would be Tri-Di first of all. The loud comedians, and the\r\nmusical commercials, and the loud bands, and the commercials, and the\r\nloud songs....\r\n\r\nAnd every twenty minutes or so, the viewer would jangle with one of\r\nFelicia\'s friends calling up, and more yammering from Felicia.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there would be company that night, to play cards and sip drinks\r\nand talk and talk and talk, and never say a thing at all.\r\n\r\nThere would be aircraft shaking the house now and then, and the cry of\r\nthe monorail horn at intervals.\r\n\r\nAnd then, at last, it would be time to go to bed, and the murmur of the\r\nsomnolearner orating him on the Theory of Groups all through the long\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nAnd in the morning, he would be shocked into awareness with the clangor\r\nof the alarm clock and whatever disc jockey the clock radio happened to\r\ntune in on.\r\n\r\nJoseph Partch\'s world was made up of sounds and noises, he decided.\r\nDimly, he wondered of what civilization itself would be constructed if\r\nall the sounds were once taken away. _Why_, after all, was the world\r\nof Man so noisy? It was almost as if--as if everybody were making as\r\nmuch noise as they could to conceal the fact that there was something\r\nlacking. Or something they were afraid of.\r\n\r\nLike a little boy whistling loudly as he walks by a cemetery at night.\r\n\r\nPartch got out of his chair and stared out the window again. There was\r\na fire over on the East Side, a bad one by the smoke. The fire engines\r\nwent screaming through the streets like wounded dragons. Sirens, bells.\r\nPolice whistles.\r\n\r\nAll at once, Partch realized that never in his life had he experienced\r\nreal quiet or solitude. That actually, he had no conception of what an\r\nabsence of thunder and wailing would be like. A total absence of sound\r\nand noise.\r\n\r\nAlmost, it was like trying to imagine what a negation of _space_ would\r\nbe like.\r\n\r\nAnd then he turned, and his eyes fell on Bob Wills\' machine. It could\r\nreduce the noise level of a rocket motor by 25 per cent, Wills had\r\nsaid. Here in the office, the sound level was less than that of a\r\nrocket motor.\r\n\r\nAnd the machine worked on ordinary house current, Bob had said.\r\n\r\nPartch had an almost horrifying idea. Suppose....\r\n\r\nBut what would Dr. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Coles say about this, Partch wondered. Oh, he had to\r\nget a grip on himself. This was silly, childish....\r\n\r\nBut looking down, he found that he had already plugged in the line\r\ncord. An almost erotic excitement began to shake Joseph\'s body. The\r\nsense of disaster had surged up anew, but he didn\'t recognize it yet.\r\n\r\nAn absence of _sound_? No! Silly!\r\n\r\nThen a fire engine came tearing around the corner just below the\r\nwindow, filling the office with an ocean of noise.\r\n\r\nJoseph\'s hand jerked and flicked the switch.\r\n\r\nAnd then the dream came back to him, the nightmare of the night before\r\nthat had precipitated, unknown to him, his mood of foreboding. It came\r\nback to him with stark realism and flooded him with unadorned fear.\r\n\r\nIn the dream, he had been in a forest. Not just the city park, but a\r\n_real_ forest, one thousands of miles and centuries away from human\r\ncivilization. A wood in which the foot of Man had never trod.\r\n\r\nIt was dark there, and the trees were thick and tall. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
There was no\r\nwind, the leaves were soft underfoot. And Joseph Partch was all alone,\r\n_completely_ alone.\r\n\r\nAnd it was--quiet.\r\n\r\nDoctor Coles looked at the patient on the white cot sadly.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve only seen a case like it once before in my entire career, Dr.\r\nLeeds."\r\n\r\nLeeds nodded.\r\n\r\n"It _is_ rather rare. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Look at him--total catatonia. He\'s curled into a\r\nperfect foetal position. Never be the same again, I\'m afraid."\r\n\r\n"The shock must have been tremendous. An awful psychic blow, especially\r\nto a person as emotionally disturbed as Mr. Partch was."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that machine of Mr. Wills\' is extremely dangerous. What amazes\r\nme is that it didn\'t kill Partch altogether. Good thing we got to him\r\nwhen we did."\r\n\r\nDr. Coles rubbed his jaw.\r\n\r\n"Yes, you know it _is_ incredible how much the human mind can sometimes\r\ntake, actually. As you say, it\'s a wonder it didn\'t kill him."\r\n\r\nHe shook his head.\r\n\r\n"Perfectly horrible. How could any modern human stand it? Two hours, he\r\nwas alone with that machine. Imagine--_two hours_ of total silence!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s The Rumble and the Roar, by Stephen Bartholomew\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
