"Hello, freighter!" he repeated. "We\'re survivors of a\r\nshipwreck. Can you pick us up? 

=== Chunk 2 ===
Please answer." His voice grew more\r\nurgent. "Please pick us up! Our air supply is failing!"\r\n\r\nMatt shook his thick black head of hair. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
"If they fall for this,\r\nthey\'re stupider than I gave them credit for." His hand rubbed the gun\r\nhidden beneath his shirt.\r\n\r\nA fierce cone of light flared in the freighter\'s forward rockets,\r\nbrighter for an instant than the sun\'s remote disc.\r\n\r\n"They are falling for it, Matt," Henry exclaimed. A wide grin spread\r\nover his pudgy baby-face. "They\'re slowing down."\r\n\r\nThe radio receiver came to life. "Hello, survivors. We hear your\r\nmessage and are adjusting course to pick you up. Stand by."\r\n\r\nJake turned to his cohorts, a triumphant glint in his pale grey eyes.\r\n"I knew they would. What were you guys worried about?"\r\n\r\n"They don\'t like to," said Matt. "Costs them time."\r\n\r\n"Space law says they have to," said Henry.\r\n\r\n"Space law!" echoed Matt. "There isn\'t a space patrol within two\r\nhundred million miles."\r\n\r\n"Gosh, it\'s a big ship," said Henry. "Wonder what\'s in its cargo?"\r\n\r\n"Yeah, Jake. How about telling us now?"\r\n\r\nJake smiled with self-contentment. "I said it would be worth your\r\nwhile. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Be patient a few minutes longer."\r\n\r\nThe cargo hold of the freighter opened. A rocket-propelled net shot out\r\ninto space. Their tiny unit was caught up like a fish and dragged into\r\nthe freighter\'s maw.\r\n\r\nThe first mate stood by as they clambered out of the unit.\r\n\r\n"We sure do thank you," said Jake to the ship\'s officer. "Another hour\r\nand it would have been too late."\r\n\r\n"Say," said Matt, "has your ship picked up any of the others?"\r\n\r\n"No," said the mate. "How many more were there?"\r\n\r\n"Seven, I think. We had a ship about your size. How many are in your\r\ncrew?"\r\n\r\n"Eight altogether," said the mate. "Perhaps you had better tell the\r\ncaptain about your accident."\r\n\r\nHe led them to the bridge. It was a darkened compartment, with green\r\nluminescent control panel, and a great steel-glass turret overlooking\r\nthe universe. Dominating the scene was a huge, dramatic closeup of\r\nSaturn, girdled by its thin, tilted rings.\r\n\r\n"You are the captain?" said Jake to the grave elderly man at the\r\ncontrols.\r\n\r\n"I am. You are the survivors?"\r\n\r\nJake and his companions bared their guns.\r\n\r\n"Call your entire crew," said Jake, pressing the muzzle into the\r\ncaptain\'s side. "I want to see eight men in this room."\r\n\r\n"Ah," said the captain sadly. "So this is what our mercy stop has let\r\nus in for."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey marched the eight crew members to the ship\'s air lock.\r\n\r\n"Get in," said Jake.\r\n\r\n"Surely it is not necessary for you to kill us," said the captain. "Why\r\ndon\'t you set us adrift in a survival unit? Give us a fighting chance."\r\n\r\n"Space death is such a terrible way to go," said the first mate.\r\n\r\n"Get in," said Jake. "I haven\'t said anything about what I was going to\r\ndo with you."\r\n\r\nThe eight looked at one another, then slowly, apprehensively, entered\r\nthe air lock.\r\n\r\nMatt pushed the button closing the inner door. Henry pushed the button\r\nopening the outer door.\r\n\r\nEight bodies drifted in space.\r\n\r\nJake took over the freighter\'s controls.\r\n\r\n"You sure you can find your way to Japetus?" Matt queried. "That moon\r\nis just a glorified piece of rock."\r\n\r\n"No trouble at all. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Remember when we landed there? I left our ship\'s\r\nradio on, sending out a carrier beam. We\'ll just follow it in on\r\ndirectional-automatic."\r\n\r\n"Hey, Jake," said Henry. "How about the cargo? I\'ve been looking over\r\nthe cargo manifest, and all it says is five thousand carboys of oxygen."\r\n\r\n"Oxygen?" said Matt, with rising concern. "When we were on Titan you\r\ntold us this ship contained something very valuable."\r\n\r\n"Yeah, Jake, what\'s the story?"\r\n\r\n"Calm down, you two. This oxygen cargo is the most valuable stuff in\r\nthe solar system right now."\r\n\r\n"Aw come on," said Matt. "All you have to do is breathe to get a lung\r\nfull of it. Is this some joke?"\r\n\r\n"Eight dead men aren\'t my idea of a joke," said Henry, a frown crossing\r\nhis pudgy features.\r\n\r\n"All right," said Jake. "This was top secret information on Titan.\r\nThere\'s been a bad leak in the city dome. They\'re losing tons of air\r\nevery day, and so far no one\'s been able to find the hole."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t hear anything about it when I was there," said Matt.\r\n\r\n"Of course not. The engineers have kept it from the colonists so there\r\nwouldn\'t be a stampede to get out. Because there aren\'t nearly enough\r\nships to evacuate everybody."\r\n\r\n"Then just where do we come in?" asked Henry.\r\n\r\nJake shook his head impatiently. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
"Can\'t you see? This is an emergency\r\nshipment of oxygen for Titan. Their reserves are just about gone. They\r\nfigured it would take about ten days to check the entire dome, but\r\nthey\'ve only got about three days\' supply of oxygen left."\r\n\r\nMatt nodded approvingly. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
"I\'m beginning to see it now. When that\'s\r\ngone, they\'ll pay any price to get more."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got it," said Jake. "There\'s a Federation bank on Titan with\r\nassets of thirty million. We\'ll take every penny.

=== Chunk 8 ===
"\r\n\r\nHenry was worried. "Well, what if they find that hole before the three\r\ndays are up. Then we won\'t be in such a good bargaining position."\r\n\r\n"In that case," said Jake, his grey eyes flickering like chalcedony,\r\n"we\'ll make a new hole."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey landed on Japetus.\r\n\r\n"Now, one of us has to deliver the ultimatum," said Jake. "One of us\r\nhas to go back to Titan and tell them our terms."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t that pretty risky?" said Matt. "They\'ll hold that guy hostage."\r\n\r\n"No, we aren\'t doing it that way." Jake withdrew an envelope from his\r\ncoat. "We just get there and mail this registered letter to the city\r\nmanager. It says, deliver the money to Hyperion, and no monkey business\r\nor we destroy the oxygen. That means, the city dies if anyone tries to\r\ntail us or pull a double cross."\r\n\r\n"They won\'t take a chance when so many lives are at stake," said Henry.\r\n"And we\'ll each make ten million on the deal."\r\n\r\n"All right," said Matt. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
"Which of us goes?"\r\n\r\nJake cut up three slips of paper. "Let\'s draw lots," he suggested.\r\n"That\'s the fairest way."\r\n\r\nHenry drew the assignment.\r\n\r\n"Be sure to bring back some whiskey," said Matt. "We forgot to lay in a\r\nsupply."\r\n\r\nHenry took off for Titan.\r\n\r\nJake turned to Matt. "Look," he said, "I arranged it so Henry would\r\ntake the letter because I wanted to talk to you. When you come right\r\ndown to it, Matt, what need do we have for three people in the deal?"\r\n\r\nMatt slowly nodded his thick black head of hair, as comprehension\r\nspread over his features.\r\n\r\n"With just two people to divide up the pot, our shares would be fifteen\r\nmillion apiece," said Jake.\r\n\r\n"And less chance of getting caught afterwards," Matt added.\r\n\r\nThey shook hands.\r\n\r\nHenry returned from Titan eight hours later.\r\n\r\n"I mailed the letter," he said. "And I bought the whiskey."\r\n\r\n"Good," said Matt, "pour us all a drink."\r\n\r\nHenry started to uncork the bottle. Jake and Matt reached for their\r\nguns and shot him simultaneously. A look of bewilderment crossed his\r\nbaby face as he fell dead.\r\n\r\nThe whiskey bottle tipped over, but Matt retrieved it quickly, before\r\nmore than half had spilled. With an amused look at the dead partner, he\r\nlifted the bottle to his lips and took a deep swig.\r\n\r\nMatt handed the bottle to Jake, who drank several ounces. But his\r\nenjoyment was interrupted by a bleating sound from the ship\'s\r\nproximity alarm.\r\n\r\n"There\'s another ship nearby!" said Jake in alarm.\r\n\r\nA rocket ship appeared suddenly overhead.\r\n\r\n"That\'s a police ship from Titan!" Matt exclaimed. "But how on Saturn\r\ncould they have known we were here?"\r\n\r\n"They must have trailed Henry. That stupid fool probably took his time\r\nabout buying the whiskey, and the letter got delivered before he left\r\nTitan!"\r\n\r\nHe strode to the ship\'s radio.\r\n\r\n"It won\'t do them any good, though. I\'ll tell \'em I\'ll blast the entire\r\ncargo if they land!"\r\n\r\nAbruptly, Jake felt a sharp pain in his belly. His throat and windpipe\r\nwere dry, terribly dry and scorched.\r\n\r\n"What\'s wrong with me?" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nThen he turned to see Matt doubled over in agony.\r\n\r\n"The whiskey," Matt whispered hoarsely. "Henry...."\r\n\r\n"Poisoned!" Jake gasped. "The dirty double-crosser!"\r\n\r\nWhen the police agents of Titan forced their way into the ship, they\r\nfound the three thieves side by side.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
