There were times when the\r\n    Chancellor suspected that he really was a humanistic old fool, but\r\n    this seemed to be his destiny and it was difficult to be anything\r\n    else. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
Human, like all other organic life on Earth, was dying. Where\r\n    it spawned, it spawned monsters. What was to be the answer?_\r\n\r\n\r\n  it\'s\r\n   all\r\n yours\r\n\r\n _by ... Sam Merwin, Jr._\r\n\r\n\r\n It was a lonely thing to rule over a dying world--a\r\n world that had become sick, so terribly sick....\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor\'s private washroom, discreetly off the innermost of his\r\nofficial suite of offices, was a dream of gleaming black porcelain and\r\nsolid gold. Each spout, each faucet, was a gracefully stylized mermaid,\r\nthe combination stall shower-steam room a marvel of hydraulic comfort\r\nand decor with variable lighting plotted to give the user every sort of\r\nbeneficial ray, from ultraviolet to black heat.\r\n\r\nBut Bliss was used to it. At the moment, as he washed his hands, he was\r\nfar more concerned with the reflection of his face in the mirror above\r\nthe dolphin-shaped bowl. With a sort of wry resignation, he accepted the\r\nred rims of fatigue around his eyes, the batch of white at his left\r\ntemple that was spreading toward the top of his dark, well-groomed head.\r\nHe noted that the lines rising from the corners of his mouth to the\r\ncurves of his nostrils seemed to have deepened noticeably during the\r\npast few days.\r\n\r\nAs he dried his hands in the air-stream, he told himself that he was\r\nletting his imagination run away with him--imagination had always been\r\nhis weakness, and a grave failing for a head of state. And while he drew\r\non his special, featherweight gloves, he reminded himself that, if he\r\nwas aging prematurely, it was nobody\'s fault but his own. No other man\r\nor woman approaching qualification for the job would have taken it--only\r\na sentimental, humanistic fool like himself.\r\n\r\nHe took a quick sip from the benzedral fountain, waited for the\r\nrestorative to do its work. Then, feeling moderately refreshed, he\r\nreturned to his office, sank into the plastifoam cushions of the chair\r\nbehind his tabletop mountain of a desk and pressed the button that\r\ninformed Myra, his confidential secretary, he was ready.\r\n\r\nThere were five in the delegation--by their collars or robes, a priest,\r\na rabbi, a lama, a dark-skinned Watusi witchman and a white robed abbess\r\ndraped in chaste, flowing white. Automatically, he surveyed them,\r\nchecking. The priest\'s right shoe was twice as broad as his left, the\r\nrabbi\'s head, beneath the black cap that covered it, was long and thin\r\nas a zucchini squash. The witchman, defiantly bare and black as ebony\r\nfrom the waist up, had a tiny duplicate of his own handsome head\r\nsprouting from the base of his sternum. The visible deformities of the\r\nlama and abbess were concealed beneath their flowing robes. But they\r\nwere there--they had to be there.\r\n\r\nBliss rose as they entered and said, waving a gloved hand at the chairs\r\non their side of the desk, "Greetings, sirs and madam--please be\r\nseated." And, when they were comfortable, "Now, to what do I owe the\r\nhonor of this visit?"\r\n\r\nHe knew, of course--sometimes he thought he knew more than any man\r\nshould be allowed or able to know--but courtesy and custom demanded the\r\nquestion. It was the witchman who answered. Apparently he was spokesman\r\nfor the group.\r\n\r\nHe said, speaking beautiful Cantabrigian English, "Honorable sir, we\r\nhave come as representatives of the religions of the world, not to\r\nprotest but in a spirit of enquiry. Our flocks grow increasingly\r\nrestive, when they are not leaving us altogether, our influence grows\r\nless. We wish to know what steps, if any, are being taken toward\r\nmodification or abrogation of the sterility program. Without hope of\r\nposterity, mankind is lost."\r\n\r\nWhile the others murmured their agreement, Bliss focused his gaze on the\r\nsealed lids of the tiny face sprouting from the Watusi\'s breastbone. He\r\nwondered if there were eyes behind them, if there were a tongue behind\r\nthose tiny clamped lips, and what words such a tongue would utter if it\r\ncould speak.\r\n\r\n"We are waiting, honorable sir," the spokesman said.\r\n\r\nShaking himself free of the absorption, Bliss glanced at the\r\nteleprompter on his desk. Efficient as ever, Myra had their names there\r\nbefore him. He said, "Gentle R\'hau-chi, I believe a simple exposition\r\nof our situation, and of what programs we are seeking to meet and\r\nmitigate it with, will give you the answers. Not, perhaps, the answers\r\nyou seek, but the answers we must accept ..."\r\n\r\nAlthough the reports from World Laboratories changed from day to day, he\r\nknew the speech by heart. For the problem remained. Humanity, like\r\nvirtually all other organic life on Earth, was dying. Where it spawned,\r\nit spawned monsters. On three-dimensional vidar rolls, he showed them\r\nlive shots of what the laboratories were doing, what they were trying to\r\ndo--in the insemination groups, the incubators, the ray-bombardment\r\nchambers, the parthenogenesis bureau.\r\n\r\nStudying them, he could see by their expressions, hear by the prayers\r\nthey muttered, how shocking these revelations were. It was one thing to\r\nknow what was going on--another for them to see for themselves. It was\r\nneither pretty--nor hopeful.\r\n\r\nWhen it was over, the rabbi spoke. He said, in deep, slightly guttural,\r\nvastly impressive intonations, "What about Mars, honorable sir? Have you\r\nreached communication with our brothers and sisters on the red planet?"\r\n\r\nBliss shook his head. He glanced at the alma-calendar at his elbow and\r\ntold them, "Mars continues to maintain silence--as it has for two\r\nhundred and thirty-one years. Ever since the final war."\r\n\r\nThey knew it, but they had to hear it from him to accept it even\r\nbriefly. There was silence, long wretched silence. Then the abbess\r\nspoke. She said, "Couldn\'t we send out a ship to study conditions first\r\nhand, honorable sir?"\r\n\r\nBliss sighed. He said, "The last four spaceships on Earth were sent to\r\nMars at two-year intervals during the last perihelions. Not one of them\r\ncame back. That was more than a half century ago. Since I accepted this\r\noffice, I have had some of our ablest remaining scientific brains\r\nworking on the problem of building a new ship. They have not been\r\nsuccessful." He laid his gloved hands, palms upward, on the desk, added,\r\n"It appears that we have lost the knack for such projects."\r\n\r\nWhen they were gone, he walked to the broad window and looked out over\r\nthe World Capital buildings at the verdant Sahara that stretched\r\nhundreds of miles to the foot of the faintly purple Atlas Mountains on\r\nthe northwestern horizon. A blanket of brilliant green, covering what\r\nhad once been the greatest of all Earthly deserts--but a poisonous\r\nblanket of strange plant mutations, some of them poisonous beyond\r\nbelief.\r\n\r\nTruly, Bliss thought, he belonged to a remarkable species. Man had\r\nconquered his environment, he had even, within the limits of the Solar\r\nSystem, conquered space. He had planted, and successfully, his own kind\r\non a neighboring planet and made it grow. But man had never, at least\r\non his home planet, conquered himself.\r\n\r\nOverpopulation had long since ceased to be a problem--the atomic wars\r\nhad seen to that. But, thanks to the miracles of science--atomics and\r\nautomation--man had quickly rebuilt the world into a Garden of Eden with\r\nup-to-date plumbing. He might have won two planets, but he had turned\r\nhis Eden into an arbor of deadly nightshade.\r\n\r\nOddly, it had not been the dreadful detonations of thermo-nuclear bombs\r\nthat had poisoned his paradise--though, of course, they had helped. It\r\nhad been the constant spillage of atomic waste into the upper atmosphere\r\nthat had spelled ruin. Now, where four billion people had once lived in\r\nwar and want, forty million lived in poisoned plenty. He was chancellor\r\nof a planet whose ruling species could not longer breed without\r\ndisaster.\r\n\r\nHis was the last generation. It should have been a peaceful generation.\r\nBut it was not.\r\n\r\nFor, as population decreased, so did the habitable areas of Earth. The\r\nformerly overpopulated temperate regions were now ghastly jungles of\r\nself-choking mutant plant growth. Only what had been the waste\r\nareas--Antarctica, the Gobi, Australia, Patagonia and the Sahara-Arabia\r\ndistricts--could still support even the strange sorts of human life that\r\nremained.\r\n\r\nAnd the forty millions still alive were restless, frightened, paranoiac.\r\nEach believed his own group was being systematically exterminated in\r\nfavor of some other. None had yet faced the fact that humanity, for all\r\npractical purposes, was already dead on Earth.\r\n\r\nHe sensed another presence in the room. It was Myra, his secretary,\r\nbearing a sheaf of messages in one hand, a sheaf of correspondence for\r\nhim to sign in the other. She said, "You look beat, chancellor. Sit\r\ndown.

=== Chunk 3 ===
"\r\n\r\nBliss sat down. Myra, as his faithful and efficient amanuensis for more\r\nthan fifteen years, had her rights. One of them was taking care of him\r\nduring working hours. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
She was still rather pretty, he noted with\r\nsurprise. An Afro-Asian with skin like dark honey and smooth, pleasant,\r\nrather flat features. It was, he thought, a pity she had that third eye\r\nin her forehead.\r\n\r\nShe stood beside him while he ran through the letters and signed them.\r\n"Meeting of the regional vice-chancellors tomorrow, eh?" he said as he\r\nhanded them back to her.\r\n\r\n"Right, chancellor," she said crisply. "Ten o\'clock. You may have to\r\ntake another whirlwind trip to tell them the situation is well in hand."\r\n\r\nHe grunted and glanced at the messages, scanned them quickly, tossed\r\nthem into the disposal vent beside his desk. Myra looked moderately\r\ndisapproving. "What about that possible ship from Mars?" she asked.\r\n"Shouldn\'t you look into it?"\r\n\r\nHe grunted again, looked up at her, said, "If I\'d looked into every\r\n\'ship from Mars\' astronomy has come up with in the nine years I\'ve held\r\nthis office, I\'d never have had time for anything else. You can lay odds\r\nit\'s a wild asteroid or something like that."\r\n\r\n"They sound pretty sure this time," Myra said doubtfully.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t they always?" he countered. "Come on, Myra, wrap it up. Time to\r\ngo home."\r\n\r\n"Roger, boss," she said, blinking all three eyes at him.\r\n\r\nBliss turned on the autopi and napped while the gyrojet carried him to\r\nhis villa outside Dakar. Safely down on the roof of the comfortable,\r\nautomatic white house, he took the lift down to his second-floor suite,\r\nwhere he showered and changed into evening sandals and clout. He\r\nredonned his gloves, then rode down another two flights to the terrace,\r\nwhere Elise was waiting for him in a gossamer-thin iridescent eggshell\r\nsari. They kissed and she patted the place on the love-seat beside her.\r\nShe had a book--an old-fashioned book of colored reproductions of\r\nlong-since-destroyed old masters on her lap. The artist was a man named\r\nPeter Paul Rubens.\r\n\r\nEyeing the opulent nudes, she giggled and said, "Don\'t they look\r\nawfully--plain? I mean, women with only two breasts!

=== Chunk 5 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Well--yes," he said. "If you want to take that angle."\r\n\r\n"Idiot!" she said. "Honestly, darling, you\'re the strangest sort of man\r\nto be a World Chancellor."\r\n\r\n"These are strange times," he told her, smiling without mirth, though\r\nwith genuine affection.\r\n\r\n"Suppose--just suppose," she said, turning the pages slowly, "biology\r\nshould be successful in stabilizing the species again. Would they _have_\r\nto set it back that far? 

=== Chunk 6 ===
I mean, either we or _they_ would feel awfully\r\nout of style."\r\n\r\n"What would you suggest?" he asked her solemnly.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be nasty," she said loftily. Then she giggled again and ruffled\r\nhis hair. "I wish you\'d have it dyed one color," she told him. "Either\r\nblack or gray--or why not a bright puce?"\r\n\r\n"What\'s for dinner?" he asked, adding, "If I can still eat after that."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe regional vice-chancellors were awaiting him in the\r\nnext-to-the-innermost office when Bliss arrived at World\r\nCapital the next morning. Australia, Antarctica, Patagonia, Gobi,\r\nSahara-Arabia--they followed him inside like so many penguins in the\r\nblack-and-white official robes. All were deathly serious as they stated\r\ntheir problems.\r\n\r\nGobi wanted annual rainfall cut from 60 to 45 centimeters.\r\n\r\nSahara-Arabia was not receiving satisfactory food synthetics--there had\r\nbeen Moslem riots because of pork flavor in the meat.\r\n\r\nPatagonia was suffering through a species of sport-worm that was\r\nthreatening to turn it into a desert if biology didn\'t come up with a\r\nremedy fast.\r\n\r\nAntarctica wanted temperature lowered from a nighttime norm of 62\xc2\xb0\r\nFahrenheit to 57.6\xc2\xb0. It seemed that the ice in the skating rinks, which\r\nwere the chief source of exercise and entertainment for the populace,\r\ngot mushy after ten p.m.\r\n\r\nAustralia wanted the heavy uranium deposits under the Great Central\r\nDesert neutralized against its causing further mutations.\r\n\r\nFor a moment, Bliss was tempted to remind his viceroys that it was not\r\ngoing to make one bit of difference whether they made their spoiled\r\ncitizens happy or not. The last man on Earth would be dead within fifty\r\nyears or so, anyway. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
But that would have been an unpardonable breach of\r\ntaste. Everyone _knew_, of course, but it was never mentioned. To state\r\nthe truth was to deny hope. And without hope, there was no life.\r\n\r\nBliss promised to see that these matters were tended to at once, taking\r\neach in turn. This done, they discussed his making another whirlwind\r\ntrip through the remaining major dominions of the planet to bolster\r\nmorale. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
He was relieved when at last, the amenities concluded, the\r\npenguins filed solemnly out. He didn\'t know which he found more\r\nunattractive--Gobi\'s atrophied third leg, strapped tightly to the inside\r\nof his left thigh and calf, or Australia\'s jackass ears. Then, sternly,\r\nhe reminded himself that it was not their fault they weren\'t as lucky as\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nMyra came in, her three eyes aglow, and said, "Boss, you were wrong for\r\nonce in your life."\r\n\r\n"What is it this time?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"About that Martian ship," she repeated. "It just landed on the old\r\nspaceport. You can see it from the window.

=== Chunk 9 ===
"\r\n\r\n"For God\'s sake!" Bliss was on his feet, moving swiftly to the window.\r\nIt was there--needle-nosed, slim as one of the mermaids in his private\r\nwashroom, graceful as a vidar dancer. The entire length of it gleamed\r\nlike silver in the sunlight.\r\n\r\nBliss felt the premature old age that had been crowding upon him of late\r\nfall away like the wool of a sheep at shearing. Here, at last, was\r\nhope--real hope. After almost two and a half centuries of\r\nnon-communication, the men of the infant planet had returned to the aid\r\nof the aging planet. For, once they saw the condition of Earth, and\r\nunderstood it, there could be no question of anything else.\r\n\r\nMars, during the years of space-flight from Earth, had been the outlet\r\nfor the mother planet\'s ablest, toughest, brightest, most aggressive\r\nyoung men and women. They had gone out to lick a hostile environment,\r\nthey had been hand-picked for the job--and they had done it. The ship,\r\nout there in the poisonous Sahara, was living proof of their success.\r\n\r\nHe turned from the window and went back to his desk. He said, "Myra,\r\nhave their leader brought here to see me as soon as possible."\r\n\r\n"_Roger!_" she said, leaving him swiftly, gracefully. Again he thought\r\nit was too bad about her third eye. It had made it awfully hard for her\r\nto find a husband. He supposed he should be grateful, since it had made\r\nhim an incomparably efficient secretary.\r\n\r\nThe young man was space-burned and silver-blond of hair. He was broad\r\nand fair of feature and his body was tall and lean and perfect in his\r\nblack, skin-tight uniform with the silver rocket-burst on the left\r\nbreast. He stood at attention, lifted a gauntleted hand in salute and\r\nsaid, "Your excellency, Chancellor Bliss--Space-Captain Hon Yaelstrom of\r\nSyrtis City, Mars, bearing official rank of Inter-planetary legate\r\nplenipotentiary. My papers, sir."\r\n\r\nHe stood stiff as a ramrod and laid a set of imposing-looking documents\r\non the vast desk before Bliss. His accent was stiff as his spinal\r\ncolumn. Bliss glanced casually at the papers, nodded and handed them\r\nback. So this, he thought, was how a "normal," a pre-atomic, a\r\nnon-mutated human, looked. Impressive.\r\n\r\nCatching himself wandering, he pushed a box of costly smokes toward the\r\nambassador.\r\n\r\n"_Nein_--no thank you, sir," was the reply.\r\n\r\n"Suppose you sit down and tell me what we can do for you," said Bliss,\r\nmotioning toward a chair.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, sir, I prefer to stand," was the reply. And, when Bliss\r\nmotioned that it was all right, "My mission is not a happy one,\r\nexcellency. Due to overpopulation on Mars, I have been sent to inform\r\nthe government of Earth that room must be made to take care of our\r\noverpopulation."\r\n\r\n"I see," Bliss leaned back in his chair, trying to read the situation\r\ncorrectly. "That may take a little doing. You see, we aren\'t exactly\r\nawash with real estate here."\r\n\r\nThe reply was rigid and harsh. Captain Yaelstrom said, "I regret to\r\nremind your excellency that I have circled this planet before landing.\r\nIt is incredibly rich in plant growth, incredibly underpopulated. And I\r\nassure your excellency that my superiors have not sent me here with any\r\nidle request. Mars must have room to emigrate."\r\n\r\n"And if we find ourselves unable to give it to you?"\r\n\r\n"I fear we shall have to take it, your excellency."\r\n\r\nBliss studied the visitor from space, then said, "This is rather sudden,\r\nyou know. I fear it will take time. You must have prospered amazingly on\r\nMars to have overpopulated the planet so soon."\r\n\r\n"Conditions have not been wholly favorable," was the cryptic reply. "But\r\nas to time, we are scarcely in condition to move our surplus population\r\novernight. It will take years--perhaps decades--twenty-five years at a\r\nminimum."\r\n\r\nTwenty-five years! That was too soon. If Captain Yaelstrom were a\r\ntypical Martian, there was going to be trouble. Bliss recalled again\r\nthat Earth had sent only its most aggressive young folk out to the red\r\nplanet. He made up his mind then and there that he was somehow going to\r\nsalvage for Earth its final half-century of peace.\r\n\r\nHe said, "How many people do you plan to send here, Captain?"\r\n\r\nThe ambassador hesitated. Then he said, "According to the computations\r\nof our experts, taking the population curve during the next twenty-five\r\nyears into account, there will be seventeen million, three hundred\r\nthirty-two thousand five hundred--approximately."\r\n\r\nThe figure was too large to be surplus, Bliss decided. It sounded to him\r\nas if humanity were about to abandon Mars completely. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
He wondered what\r\nthe devil had gone wrong, decided this was hardly the time to ask. He\r\noffered Captain Yaelstrom a drink, which was refused, then asked him if\r\nhe wouldn\'t like to wash up.\r\n\r\nTo his mild surprise, the ambassador nodded eagerly. "I shall be\r\ngrateful," he said. "You have no idea how cramped spaceship quarters can\r\nbe."\r\n\r\n"I can imagine," said Bliss dryly. He led the way into the\r\nblack-and-gold washroom, was amused at the slight but definite popping\r\nof ambassadorial eyes. Earth might be dying, he thought, but at least\r\nher destroyers would leave a heritage. He motioned toward the basin with\r\nits mermaid taps and Captain Yaelstrom hesitated, then began pulling off\r\nhis black gauntlets.\r\n\r\nBliss thought of something. "You mentioned twenty-five years," he said.\r\n"Is that Martian time or Earth time?"\r\n\r\n"Martian time," said the ambassador, letting the water run over his\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five years, Martian time--a Martian year was 1.88 Earth years.\r\nBliss exhaled and said, "I think perhaps we shall be able to come to an\r\nagreement. It will take a little time, of course--channels, and all\r\nthat."\r\n\r\nThe Martian held his hands in front of the air-drier. They were strong,\r\nbrown hands with long, muscular fingers. Bliss looked at them and knew\r\nthe whole story. For, like himself, Captain Yaelstrom had seven fingers\r\non each. Man had done no better on Mars than he had at home. The reason\r\nfor such a desperate move as emigration was all too clear.\r\n\r\nCaptain Yaelstrom stood back from the bowl, then noticed the stall\r\nshower. He said, "What is this? 

=== Chunk 11 ===
We have nothing like it on Mars."\r\n\r\nBliss explained its several therapeutic uses, then said, "Perhaps you\'d\r\nlike to try it yourself while I order us luncheon."\r\n\r\n"May I, excellency?" the Martian legate asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n"Go right ahead," said Bliss magnanimously. "It\'s all yours."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ November 1956.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.
