]\r\n\r\n\r\nI lit the last cigarette I would ever smoke and took my airsuit out\r\nof the compartment under the control-board. The two-man cubicle was\r\ncoffin-cold even under the blast of sunlight pouring through the\r\nforward port, and the air smelled of stale tobacco and machine oil.\r\nBeside me Charlie Kosta\'s voice droned into the communicator, winging\r\nback two-hundred thirty thousand miles to the listening millions of\r\nEarth.\r\n\r\n"Our air is nearly gone," Charlie said. "We have about twelve minutes\r\nleft for deceleration, but we\'ll never make landing. The Luna V is\r\nriddled like a sieve, spewing out heavy-water fuel along with her\r\nair ... it\'s a miracle that a chunk hasn\'t crashed through our fuel\r\npile or the communicator--or through us. That\'s what blew up the first\r\nfour ships, we know now ... if men ever reach the moon they\'ll first\r\nhave to develop some sort of armor that will turn this barrage of\r\nmeteoric dust."\r\n\r\nI got my feet into the plastoid suit and pulled it on, letting\r\nthe transparent headpiece dangle over one shoulder like a parka\r\nhood. Charlie watched me with his tight grin, waiting through the\r\nthree-second lag of time for Earth\'s answer. Some high-ranking general\r\ndown there had pushed aside the Moon Foundation scientists to make\r\nhimself heard; his voice came over the hiss of static with a tinny,\r\nfrantic ring.\r\n\r\n"_Meteoric dust couldn\'t possibly pierce that alloy hull! It was tested\r\nover and over--_"\r\n\r\nWe waited him out, knowing that his frenzy was not for us nor for the\r\nsuccess of space flight. He was concerned, like all the military,\r\nonly with the establishing of a moon base to overlook Earth, an\r\nall-commanding launching site that would control a world. Once that\r\nbase was established, the ferment of war would come to a bitter end;\r\none nation would own the planet.\r\n\r\n"But you didn\'t test the hull out here," Charlie said patiently when\r\nthe general had finished. "You can\'t imagine the _speed_ of these\r\nparticles. We\'ve no protecting atmosphere to vaporize them, as Earth\r\nhas, and they streak through the ship so fast that they seem to strike\r\nboth sides of the hull at once.... I\'m cutting you over to Leonard\r\nNugent now. Ready, Len?

"\r\n\r\nIt was what I was waiting for. I had looked forward to this moment\r\nevery day of the nine years I had spent being groomed for the flight,\r\nand for half a lifetime of drilling before that. The waiting was almost\r\nover.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"I\'m ready," I said, and took the microphone. "But there\'s not much\r\npoint in reporting further, is there? With her fuel leaks the Luna V\r\nwill go like an A-bomb the instant we try to use the landing jets,\r\njust as the first four Lunas did ... the air is getting thinner, so\r\nthin that I\'ll have to put on my pressure suit soon. Are there any\r\nquestions?"\r\n\r\nMy only answer was the grind and roar of static.\r\n\r\nI could guess why; they were bickering and quarrelling among themselves\r\ndown there, the military men snarling at the scientists and the\r\nscientists snarling back, each blaming the other for this new failure.\r\nThe loss of the first four ships had been a mystery until they sent the\r\nLuna V out with co-pilots, equipped for full two-way communication.\r\nCharlie and I had reported from the beginning of the flight in\r\nalternate thirty-minute relays, keeping the Foundation posted so that\r\nif anything threatened us they would know the nature of the danger. Now\r\nthey were getting what they had asked for, and the problem would keep\r\nthem busy for another ten or fifteen years while the conquest of space\r\nmarked time. But they couldn\'t accept even temporary defeat calmly,\r\nof course--they had to quarrel among themselves, just as men have\r\nquarrelled since they first climbed down out of their trees and set\r\nabout organizing the business of killing each other.\r\n\r\n"We\'re going to try for a landing anyway," I said into the microphone.\r\n"We\'re going to cut in the decelerator jets as soon as we pass out of\r\nthe sun glare and into the moon\'s penumbra, where we can see."\r\n\r\nWe flashed suddenly into darkness, lost instantly in the vast conical\r\nshadow of the moon. The night half of the pocked globe loomed below,\r\nfaint and ghostly in the blue Earthshine, craggy and desolate, cold\r\nas space and as old as time. Earth hung above and behind us, and I\r\ncouldn\'t help thinking of the astronomers who had followed our flight\r\npatiently every inch of the way. They couldn\'t see us now; the daylight\r\ncrescent of the moon lay between the Luna V and the sun, burying us\r\ndeep in the utter darkness of space.\r\n\r\nCharlie took the microphone, speaking this time not to the Foundation\r\nbut to the millions who sat gaping at their radios. Some of them would\r\nbe muttering maudlin prayers for our safety, some would be gleefully\r\ncollecting the bets they had made on our chances of getting across; all\r\nof them would be thrilled to the core by the vicarious imminence of\r\ndanger and death.\r\n\r\n"We don\'t want mourning and demonstrations," Charlie said. "If you\r\npeople listening to me would like to honor our memory and the memory of\r\nthe men lost before us, then forget space travel for a while and try to\r\nwork out a lasting peace down there on Earth. Because it\'s inevitable\r\nthat you\'ll conquer space some day, and if you aren\'t ready for it when\r\nit comes--"\r\n\r\nHe clicked off the communicator, and we turned to the port together to\r\nwatch the little metal sphere that hurtled up out of the darkness past\r\nthe Luna V. From behind and above us there came a great white flash of\r\natomic fire that must have blinded for the moment every watching eye on\r\nEarth.\r\n\r\n"Right on schedule," Charlie said, and swung the Luna V over the\r\ndarkside rim and across the mysterious other side of the moon, the\r\nhidden hemisphere that no man has ever seen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe ship was waiting for us there, a sleek, familiar cylinder with\r\nairlock standing open.\r\n\r\nWe went inside and closed the lock and stripped off our cumbersome\r\nairsuits, and Charlie flexed his arms and grinned at me. "Lord, I\'m\r\nglad to get that over with--it\'s been like nine years of prison!"\r\n\r\n"It was worth it," I said. I was remembering the grim green world we\r\nhad left, shivering a little when I considered the brawling simian\r\nhordes who battered their way up the scale toward a culture that\r\nmight, unchecked, some day rule the Universe.\r\n\r\n"It gives us a few more years before they come swarming down on us with\r\ntheir atomic bombs and politics and their gaping tourists," I said,\r\nstill using the speech patterns that had been drilled into me for half\r\nmy life. "We\'ve marked time long enough, hoping for the best. We\'ll\r\nneed every minute we\'ve gained to get ready for them."\r\n\r\nWe went forward then to watch the purple-skinned pilot, hairy and\r\nmany-limbed and beautifully wrinkled, engage the magnetic drive that\r\nwould send us flashing toward the planet that was home. Later, in our\r\nnatural bodies, we would speak the name of that world with reverence,\r\nbut our clumsy synthetic Earth-tongues could not master its lovely\r\nsonic extensions, and so we used another term.\r\n\r\nFor the time being, we called it Mars....\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
