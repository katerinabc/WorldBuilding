His\r\nwife had come by from time to time, bringing sandwiches and coffee.\r\nHendriks was determined to get a pair of tickets.\r\n\r\nHe turned to the man next to him. "Got the time?"\r\n\r\n"Five to nine."\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I thought. That means the ticket-office opens in five\r\nminutes." Hendriks rose on tiptoe and squinted ahead. "There must be\r\nfive hundred people ahead of us."\r\n\r\n"They say the theater holds five thousand."\r\n\r\n"I know. And that you get the same effect no matter where you sit. But\r\nstill, I\'d like to be right down there in the front."\r\n\r\nThe other man nodded. "That goes for all of us."\r\n\r\nHendriks grinned. "You know, this is the first time I ever heard of an\r\nopening performance being managed right. I mean, thrown open for public\r\nsale instead of being reserved for bigwigs."\r\n\r\n"Damned public-spirited," the other agreed.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the line began to edge forward.\r\n\r\n"They\'re selling tickets!"\r\n\r\n"The booth is open!"\r\n\r\nAbout an hour later, Hendriks plunked down his twenty dollars before\r\nthe efficient-looking girl in the ticket-cage and was handed a bulky\r\nenvelope.\r\n\r\n"These my tickets?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s right, sir."\r\n\r\nA little puzzled, but happy, he turned away and dug in the envelope.\r\nHe pulled out, not the familiar pasteboards, but two costly-looking\r\nsumptuous engraved invitations on thick stiff paper. They said:\r\n\r\n                           _You are invited_\r\n             _To the first showing anywhere in the world._\r\n                                  of\r\n                               ULTRARAMA\r\n                   the sensational new film process\r\n                           realer than life!\r\n                       Wednesday, April 25, 1973\r\n                              at 8:00 PM\r\n\r\nClutching the invitations as if they were his leases on life, Hendriks\r\nstepped into the quiktrans and moments later stepped out again just\r\noutside the door.\r\n\r\nHis wife was waiting for him with an expectant look on her face.\r\n\r\n"Did you get them?"\r\n\r\n"I sure did! Two engraved invitations, at ten bucks a throw."\r\n\r\n"They\'d better be worth it," she said anxiously.\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t you see that line when you brought me breakfast? _Eight\r\nblocks!_ Hundreds and hundreds of people all trying to get to see the\r\nfirst performance."\r\n\r\n"That doesn\'t mean a thing," she said. "After all, no one\'s ever seen\r\nthe complete movie--"\r\n\r\n"It\'s not a movie," he corrected.\r\n\r\n"All right, the complete whatchamacallit. No one\'s ever seen the\r\ncomplete thing--not even the people who made it. So how do you know\r\nit\'s good?"\r\n\r\n"Believe me, honey, this is going to be the greatest ever!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, April 25, 1973, at 7:30 in the evening, the Hendriks\r\nstood in the midst of a vast crowd that thronged the open plaza before\r\nthe Ultrarama Theater. The theater itself was a towering edifice that\r\nhad been built just for this production; it was one of the world\'s most\r\nimpressive buildings.\r\n\r\n"All right, all right," a policeman shouted. "Ticket-holders come this\r\nway. The rest of you stay back."\r\n\r\nThey cleared a channel through the mob and the Hendriks, along with\r\nseveral hundred other early arrivees, followed along to the door of the\r\nvast theater.\r\n\r\n"What are all these people doing here?" Mrs. Hendriks asked.\r\n\r\nHer husband shrugged. "Maybe they plan on crashing the gate--or\r\npossibly they think there may be some tickets left. I tell you, we\'re\r\nawfully lucky to be where we are right now."\r\n\r\nHe extended the invitations to a tall, haughty-looking doorman in a\r\nresplendent uniform. The doorman merely nodded and gestured them inside.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t they tear up the tickets?"\r\n\r\n"Not on opening night," Hendriks said. "They\'re letting us keep them as\r\nsouvenirs."\r\n\r\nThey stepped inside and found themselves in a vast, almost boundless\r\nvestibule carpeted with deep pile synthofoam of a lush purple color.\r\nVaulting arches of gleaming metal swept upward to the barely visible\r\nceiling.\r\n\r\n"If this is just the foyer," Paul Hendriks said, "imagine what it must\r\nbe inside!"\r\n\r\nHis wife nudged him. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
"Look--isn\'t that shocking!"\r\n\r\nA girl of about seventeen was coming toward them, smiling cheerfully.\r\nHendriks blinked. She wore only two nearly-transparent strips of\r\nshimmering cloth, one over her breasts and the other wrapped round her\r\nhips.\r\n\r\n"Good evening," she said. "I\'m your usher. May I show you to your\r\nseats?"\r\n\r\n"They really put on a show here," Hendriks muttered. The girl glanced\r\nat the invitations he was clutching and beckoned them to follow her.\r\nShe led the way, twitching her hips invitingly.\r\n\r\nA bright aluminoid door loomed before them. The girl touched a switch\r\nand the door slid back, revealing the actual interior of the theater.\r\n\r\nHendriks gasped.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly the size of a football stadium. Where the playing field\r\nshould be were seats, elaborate plush pneumatic affairs. And ringing\r\nthe seats was the Screen.\r\n\r\nThe Screen covered the entire walls, floor, ceiling. It hemmed the\r\naudience in completely. As Hendriks took his seat, he felt totally\r\nsurrounded by it.\r\n\r\nThey waited impatiently for the half hour to pass. The theater filled\r\nup rapidly, with first-nighters in all their finery.\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad we wore our formal clothes, dear."\r\n\r\n"Yes," Hendriks said, looking at the others. "This is quite an event.\r\nQuite an event."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe theater was totally filled by 8 P. M. sharp; the corps of near-nude\r\nusherettes performed their job swiftly and efficiently.\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly a voice said, "Welcome to ULTRARAMA."\r\n\r\nIt was a cultured, soft female voice--and it came from so close to him\r\nthat he glanced in surprise at his wife. But she was looking at him.\r\nShe had heard the voice too.\r\n\r\nIt continued: "You are about to witness the most spectacular form\r\nof entertainment ever conceived by the mind of man. Twelve years of\r\nconcentrated work went into producing what you are about to see--and\r\nno one but you will experience it. Each of you will be _taking part_;\r\neach of you will, as the series of scenes we have assembled unfolds,\r\nbe caught up in the reality of ULTRARAMA--the _realer_-than-reality\r\nUltra-reality of ULTRARAMA. Shall we begin?"\r\n\r\nThe lights in the theater dimmed--and the vast screen came to life.\r\n\r\nIt was incredible.\r\n\r\nAnd they were in Africa.\r\n\r\nThe huge plains of South Africa opened out before them. Hendriks\r\nturned his head, looking around in astonishment. The audience seemed\r\nto have disappeared. He was alone--alone in a world of yellowing grass\r\nand strange thick trees, a flat world where death could strike at any\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nIn the distance he saw four grotesque shapes--giraffes, moving along\r\nin their ungainly but yet tremendously rapid way, their long necks\r\nprojecting stiffly from their bodies. He repressed a chuckle.\r\n\r\nAnd then a low growl made him jump. He backed against a rough-barked\r\ntree and felt sweat cascade down his body as a tawny shape sprang from\r\nbehind a twisted shrub, pounced on one of the giraffes, smashed the\r\nfragile neck with a fierce swipe of a paw.\r\n\r\nThe lioness. Sudden death springing from nowhere, a bright streak that\r\nbrought violence. Hendriks looked around uneasily. The giraffes had\r\nfled; the lioness was dragging her kill into the underbrush. The warm\r\nsmell of death was in the air--that, and the buzzing of green-eyed\r\nflies an inch long. Perched on a scrawny, almost leafless tree were\r\nhooded ugly shapes.\r\n\r\nVultures. _Are they waiting for me?_\r\n\r\nThis was _too_ real. This was _unbearably_ real.\r\n\r\nA herd of gazelles came bounding out of the background, relieving some\r\nof the tension. The lovely creatures seemed to float along, touching\r\nthe ground only at occasional intervals. Behind them marched the\r\ndull-gray bulks of a herd of elephants, shambling with a ponderous gait.\r\n\r\nThis was Africa. This was the real thing, Hendriks told himself. It\r\nwasn\'t a show. Through some magic the ULTRARAMA people had actually\r\nsent him here.\r\n\r\nHe moved away, investigating. A sluggish black stream wound through the\r\njungle; curious, Hendriks walked toward it. Dark logs lay strewn almost\r\nat random in the shallow muddy water at the sides of the stream. But\r\nas he watched, one of the logs yawned, showing a double row of deadly\r\nteeth, and slid sleepily off into deeper waters.\r\n\r\nCrocodiles. Death threatened everywhere in the jungle.\r\n\r\nMonkeys chittered overhead; bright-plumaged birds flapped from tree to\r\ntree. Hendriks felt the heat, his nostrils drew in the smell. This was\r\nreal. He wondered if it would ever end, if he would ever return to his\r\nneat little city apartment and to his wife and children.\r\n\r\nHe glanced away from the stream, looked up at the sun blazing in the\r\nbright blue sky. And abruptly black death came roaring at him from a\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nHendriks had just a moment to recognize it. A leopard, black, sleek,\r\nmoving with the easy grace of a machine designed for killing. He\r\ntoppled backward under the impetus of the beast\'s furious attack,\r\nsmelled the soft musky smell of the killer.\r\n\r\nThen claws reached for his throat. Hot barbs of red pain shot through\r\nhim. He screamed out, fought, tried to hold the snapping jaws away.\r\n\r\n"No! No! It isn\'t real! Get away from me!"\r\n\r\nAnd in that instant Africa vanished.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"THE SECOND ILLUSION," that soft voice next to his ear said.\r\n\r\nHe was again alone, in an unfamiliar room. A lady\'s boudoir, he saw.\r\nA satin-covered spread lay over a wide, inviting bed; dressing-tables\r\nwere laden with perfumes and cosmetics.\r\n\r\nBehind him the door opened. A woman entered.\r\n\r\nHe had never seen her before. She was tall, dressed only in a filmy\r\nnegligee that barely concealed her long sleek legs, her firm breasts.\r\nShe was all he had ever wanted in a woman; she awakened desires that\r\nhad been dead in him for twenty years.\r\n\r\n"Hello," she said. Her voice was throbbingly throaty. "I\'ve waited a\r\nlong time for you, Paul Hendriks."\r\n\r\n_How did she know my name? How_--\r\n\r\nThen he stopped asking questions. She had glided close to him, stood\r\nthere, bosom gently rising and falling, looking into his eyes. She was\r\nnearly as tall as he. He smelled her enticing perfume.\r\n\r\n"Come," she said, taking his hand. She led him toward a chaise lounge.\r\n\r\nHe frowned. "But my wife ..." he murmured, feeling like seventeen\r\ndifferent kinds of idiot as he said the words.\r\n\r\n"Your wife is happy where she is. Come to me, Paul.

=== Chunk 3 ===
"\r\n\r\nShe drew him down beside her....\r\n\r\nWhat seemed like hours went by. Suddenly he felt a rough hand grab him,\r\nawakening him.\r\n\r\nA stranger stood there, fully dressed, menace glinting in his eyes.\r\n"Who is this man, Louise?" he demanded.\r\n\r\nWide-eyed shock was evident on the woman\'s face. "But--I didn\'t expect\r\nyou until--"\r\n\r\n"Of course not." Hendriks watched in horror as the newcomer drew a gun\r\nfrom his pocket. He lifted it; the barrel seemed to point directly at\r\nHendriks\' eyes. The finger began to tighten on the trigger--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"THE THIRD ILLUSION," said a soft voice.\r\n\r\nAnd he was holding a billowing net and a strange three-pronged weapon.\r\nThe sound of a roaring multitude reached his ears. He blinked,\r\norientating himself to the new illusion, and saw that he was in an\r\nimmense stadium. Curiously-garbed people were staring down at him.\r\n\r\n_My God_, he thought. _The Coliseum!_\r\n\r\nAnd even as the thought of recognition burst upon him, he saw\r\nhis opponent advancing over the bloody sand. It was a swarthy,\r\nbroad-shouldered man in a leather tunic, wielding a thick, short sword.\r\n\r\nSwordsman against netman. It was deadly, deadly.\r\n\r\nHendriks knew enough history to be aware of what was expected of\r\nhim. He had to ensnare the swordsman in the net and kill him with\r\nthe trident before that fierce sword could pierce his heart. It was\r\nanything but an equal contest, but with proper agility--\r\n\r\nThe sword flashed on high. Desperately Hendriks parried it with the\r\nhilt of his trident and whirled the net through the air. The swordsman\r\nlaughed and leaped back.\r\n\r\nHendriks advanced, looking for an opening. The roars of the crowd were\r\ndeafening. He swung the net tentatively, readying himself for the cast.\r\nTired muscles throbbed in his arms and thighs.\r\n\r\nThe swordsman retreated deftly, smiling. He looked confident. Hendriks\r\nbegan the cast.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the sword flashed again. It was a lightning-fast attack.\r\nHendriks managed to get the trident up to protect himself; the\r\nimpact sent pain coursing up his arm, and, numbed, he dropped the\r\nthree-pronged weapon. Laughing jovially, his opponent kicked the\r\ntrident far across the stadium and advanced with the sword.\r\n\r\nHendriks knew what he had to do. He dropped to his knees before the\r\nadvancing swordsman and gestured toward the audience.\r\n\r\nThe swordsman nodded. He lifted the sword, held it over Hendriks\' head,\r\nand looked up at the grand dais. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Hendriks looked up as well.\r\n\r\nThe thumbs were down. Emphatically so.\r\n\r\nThe sword began to descend--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"THE FOURTH ILLUSION," said the voice.\r\n\r\nHe was racing madly down the Indianapolis Speedway, bobbing along at\r\nnearly 150 miles an hour in a flimsy-looking little racing auto. Blurs\r\nwhizzed by on all sides.\r\n\r\nAhead of him he saw a car suddenly swerve into the embankment and burst\r\ninto a mass of flames. With desperate urgency he yanked on the wheel,\r\ntried to avoid the pileup--\r\n\r\nAnd failed. He felt his car going end over end into the air, and shut\r\nhis eyes, waiting for the explosion that would follow.\r\n\r\n"THE FIFTH ILLUSION," the voice said.\r\n\r\nHe was in a prehistoric jungle; strange stumpy trees were all around,\r\nlush vegetation. A slow-moving beast of immense size was thundering\r\naway from him, its tiny head close to the ground snapping up vegetation\r\nwithout cease. Overhead a leather-winged flying reptile moved through\r\nthe air in jerky swoops.\r\n\r\nThere was sudden thunder behind him. He turned.\r\n\r\nThrough a haze of giant mosquitoes he saw a mountain of a beast\r\nadvancing toward him, tiny forepaws clutching the air, vast head\r\nopening to reveal foot-long teeth.\r\n\r\nHe started to run, but even as he did so he knew it was fruitless.\r\nIn the steamy jungle sweat poured down him like summer rain. The hot\r\nbreath of the tyrannosaur was only feet behind him.\r\n\r\nHendriks turned, looked up. The mighty jaws were opening; the\r\nknife-like teeth beckoned.\r\n\r\n"No!" 

=== Chunk 5 ===
he screamed "No!"\r\n\r\nSuddenly all went blank.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe sat in numbed silence for an instant, realizing he was back in the\r\ntheater.\r\n\r\nThe voice in his ear said, "There will be a brief intermission before\r\nproceeding with the remaining half of the program. Please remain in\r\nyour seats to avoid confusion. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Thank you."\r\n\r\nHendriks shook his head wearily; he was dizzy, utterly exhausted. His\r\nstiff white shirt had lost all its starch. He was bathed in sweat.\r\nHis hands shook. His fingernails, he noticed, had been chewed to the\r\nquick. He felt as if he had been to hell and back.\r\n\r\nHe finally mustered enough strength to look over at his wife. She was\r\nsitting back in her plush chair, utterly beaten. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
He glanced around the\r\ntheater. The other first-nighters were sitting in attitudes ranging\r\nfrom glassy-eyed exhaustion to complete nervous breakdown.\r\n\r\n"The second part of the program will begin in three minutes," the\r\npleasant voice said.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no it won\'t!" Hendriks muttered out loud. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
His voice sounded like a\r\nharsh croak in his ears. He seized his wife by the hand; she felt cold,\r\nclammy.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s go, Dot. Let\'s get out of here.

=== Chunk 9 ===
"\r\n\r\nShe came to life and nodded in silent agreement. Weakly they tottered\r\ndown the vast aisle, past the pretty near-nude usherettes, through the\r\nhuge vestibule, out into the coolness of the night air and the relative\r\npeace of the city.\r\n\r\nThere were still some people gathered outside.\r\n\r\n"How is it? Real nice?

=== Chunk 10 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Is it over?"\r\n\r\n"Hey, you leavin\' so soon?"\r\n\r\nHendriks ignored them. He hailed a jetcab, helped his wife in,\r\nstaggered in himself. He gave the driver his address.\r\n\r\n"You comin\' from the Ultrarama show?" the driver asked.\r\n\r\nHendriks nodded.\r\n\r\n"Swell thing, ain\'t it? It\'s supposed to be _real_, and I mean real!"\r\n\r\n"It sure is," Hendriks agreed. He leaned back and tried to relax. His\r\nnerves were still quivering like overtaut harp strings.\r\n\r\n"It\'s quite a thing," he said. "But not for me. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
I\'m going home. I\'m\r\ngoing to take a nice calming shower, a sedative, and get in bed. Then\r\nI\'m going to read a nice quiet book. How about you, Dot?"\r\n\r\nShe nodded. "_That\'s_ real enough for me," she said.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
