]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               It was one of those days--perhaps you\'ve\r\n                 had them--when everything went right!\r\n\r\n\r\n"Let\'s go slumming," said Powers-of-pearl. "Let\'s give an earthman his\r\nwish for a day. We haven\'t played that game in ages."\r\n\r\n"How do we pick him?" Firepride asked indulgently. "Phone book?

"\r\n\r\n"Intensity\'s more fun. But no more nomads, I got so bored putting\r\nconnoisseur features on synthetic camels!"\r\n\r\nPeter Stone put on his hat and started for the station. Every third\r\nstep he inhaled and told himself: "It isn\'t that bad." Peter had a good\r\njob, a good wife, and commuting was wearing him down to a twitch. Sooty\r\nteeth-rattling train, Penn Station\'s steaming caverns, a soggy lurching\r\nbus, lunch down in sun-seared, exhaust-ventilated streets and the ride\r\nhome ... as the hated maroon dot of his train appeared, a convulsion of\r\nrevulsion shook him.\r\n\r\n"I _wish_ it weren\'t that bad!" he thought with every fiber. And\r\nPowers-of-pearl, suffused with the glow of challenge, laughed.\r\n\r\nPeter Stone, fighting at the newsstand, noted with annoyance that a\r\ncrew of maintenance men swarmed about the train. "Broke down _again_,"\r\nhe thought bitterly. Halfway down his car two men ran a vacuum cleaner\r\nover the tired plush. Keeping pace behind them, two others aimed\r\nwide-mouth silver hoses upwards, spreading thick sheets of foam on the\r\nceiling. It wasn\'t until Peter Stone unfolded his newspaper that he\r\nnoticed how quiet had spread with that foam. Next, his ears registered\r\nwith surprise the purr of freshly-oiled machinery, and his eyes the\r\nsight of a tree, for once without its double window screen of hair-oil\r\nand dried grime droplets.\r\n\r\nWhen he boarded his bus, a maintenance man was just hanging a sign over\r\nthe gagged fare box:\r\n\r\n          Due to Tax Readjustment, Urban Transportation Free.\r\n\r\nThe driver, liberated from change-making and police duties, smiled a\r\ngreeting at him. No crush in the bus, perhaps because there seemed so\r\nmany about. The silver one coming towards him had a big green and white\r\nsign: DOWN FIFTH TO 33rd. WEST ON 33rd TO SEVENTH. PENN STATION LAST\r\nSTOP. It was the first readable bus sign he remembered seeing.\r\n\r\nWhenever the light turned red, he found, squads of maintenance men\r\ndarted about the stopped cars and trucks, slapping silver cylinders\r\nover each exhaust pipe. He could hear snatches of explanations: "City\r\nordinance," "Free service." As soon as a cylinder was in place, smoke\r\nand noise stopped coming out of the exhaust.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen his hat sailed gaily towards the hook, Peter Stone realized that,\r\nincredibly, he wasn\'t tired. Work flowed through his fingers, his\r\nsecretary smiled, his boss looked in once and whistled. At noon only\r\nthe thought of paraffined carton coffee restrained him from staying in.\r\n\r\n"Coming right up, Seventeen!" said the new silver grille next to the\r\nelevator button. Cheered, he clove the mindless rush downstairs and\r\npushed inside a luncheonette where maintenance men were finishing the\r\nremoval of every second stool and the re-upholstery of the remainder\r\nwith foam cushions. A smiling waitress brought him a menu and a pencil.\r\nOpposite each item was a small circle, and a line at the top explained:\r\nTHIS IS YOUR MENUCHECK. PLEASE MARK WANTED ITEMS, DROP MENUCHECK IN\r\nSLOT.\r\n\r\nServed incredibly fast, Peter Stone ate in blissful peace. On his way\r\nout he saw that the cashier\'s cage had been replaced with three silver\r\ncabinets with hoppers for Menuchecks and money, recessed cups for\r\nchange and a turnstile each. When he walked through he found that he\r\nstill had forty minutes of his lunch hour left.\r\n\r\nForty minutes! He could walk to a bookshop, or the park ... walk,\r\nthrough exhaust fumes and the belches of airconditioner waste? But\r\nsilver mesh covered the noisome vents. A cautious sniff assured him it\r\nworked.\r\n\r\nHe decided to walk to the Library newsstands for a foreign magazine.\r\nAs he reached 42nd and Fifth an army of workmen were putting the last\r\ntouches on a structure of dull silver that spanned the four sides of\r\nthe intersection. Airy and elegant, with faint echoes of Library style,\r\nthe quadruple arch provided the perfect finishing touch for the square.\r\nEach side was composed of three escalators and moving platforms in both\r\ndirections, with a set of stairs and a promenade.\r\n\r\nTimidly, he set foot on the silver filigree. He was wafted up,\r\nacross and down. Beneath him flowed a brilliant river of quiet cars.\r\nFascinated, he took the trip back, then stood on the promenade watching\r\nthe pattern, breathing in incredulous lungfuls of clean air.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon fled on newly silent feet. Once more he put on his hat to\r\nface the ride home.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHis small, air-conditioned silver bus reached Penn Station ten minutes\r\nearlier than usual. By now Peter Stone was not overly surprised to\r\nsee silver moving ways disappearing into the Station\'s maw, nor, once\r\ninside, to feel breezes that blew silently from silver gadgets like jet\r\nengines. He also accepted the waiting passengers dancing in the great\r\nlobby--the piped music there had long been excellent.\r\n\r\nA low, pleasant voice announced his train in diamond-cut syllables\r\nthat floated from silver-dollar speakers spangling the walls. Silver\r\nescalators swept to a bright platform covered in springy non-skid\r\ngreen plastic.\r\n\r\nOne wall of his train was made up of clear plastic sliding doors.\r\nInside, there were deep pile carpets, reclining chairs, low blue\r\noverheads and movable reading lights. As the doors slid softly shut,\r\nPeter Stone remembered as usual the letter he\'d forgotten to mail for\r\nhis wife; but this time he could see a stamp machine and mail box at\r\nthe end of the car. When he got up he saw that there were also milk,\r\ncoffee, soda, fruit, cigarette, aspirin and newspaper vending machines,\r\nand three telephone booths.\r\n\r\nThe train glided to a hushed halt three minutes after a speaker at his\r\nelbow had murmured the name of his station. Before his wife\'s goggling\r\neyes, Peter Stone bounded down the steps and ran to their car. She\r\nremembered that evening the rest of her life.\r\n\r\nPowers-of-pearl let the silver evaporate, and with it the memory of it.\r\n"The best game yet," she smiled, leaning in happy exhaustion against\r\nFirepride\'s shoulder.\r\n\r\n"You were magnificent," laughed Firepride. "One step ahead of an entire\r\ncity!"

Powers-of-pearl blushed radiantly.\r\n\r\nNo trace of their game remained. But for some obscure reason, Peter\r\nStone decided that one day he would run for Mayor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
