By heck, you\'ll like\r\n    little Matt._\r\n\r\n\r\n year\r\n   of\r\n  the\r\n  big\r\n thaw\r\n\r\n _by ... Marion Zimmer Bradley_\r\n\r\n\r\n Mr. Emmett did his duty by the visitor from\r\n another world--never doubting the right of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_You say that Matthew is your own son, Mr. Emmett?_\r\n\r\nYes, Rev\'rend Doane, and a better boy never stepped, if I do say it as\r\nshouldn\'t. I\'ve trusted him to drive team for me since he was eleven,\r\nand you can\'t say more than that for a farm boy. Way back when he was a\r\nlittle shaver so high, when the war came on, he was bounden he was going\r\nto sail with this Admiral Farragut. You know boys that age--like runaway\r\ncolts. I couldn\'t see no good in his being cabin boy on some tarnation\r\nNavy ship and I told him so. If he\'d wanted to sail out on a whaling\r\nship, I \'low I\'d have let him go. But Marthy--that\'s the boy\'s Ma--took\r\non so that Matt stayed home. Yes, he\'s a good boy and a good son.\r\n\r\nWe\'ll miss him a powerful lot if he gets this scholarship thing. But I\r\n\'low it\'ll be good for the boy to get some learnin\' besides what he gets\r\nin the school here. It\'s right kind of you, Rev\'rend, to look over this\r\napplication thing for me.\r\n\r\n_Well, if he is your own son, Mr. Emmett, why did you write \'birthplace\r\nunknown\' on the line here?_\r\n\r\nRev\'rend Doane, I\'m glad you asked me that question. I\'ve been turnin\'\r\nit over in my mind and I\'ve jest about come to the conclusion it\r\nwouldn\'t be nohow fair to hold it back. I didn\'t lie when I said Matt\r\nwas my son, because he\'s been a good son to me and Marthy. But I\'m not\r\nhis Pa and Marthy ain\'t his Ma, so could be I stretched the truth jest a\r\nmite. Rev\'rend Doane, it\'s a tarnal funny yarn but I\'ll walk into the\r\nmeetin\' house and swear to it on a stack o\'Bibles as thick as a cord of\r\nwood.\r\n\r\nYou know I\'ve been farming the old Corning place these past seven year?\r\nIt\'s good flat Connecticut bottom-land, but it isn\'t like our land up in\r\nHampshire where I was born and raised. My Pa called it the Hampshire\r\nGrants and all that was King\'s land when _his_ Pa came in there and\r\nstarted farming at the foot of Scuttock Mountain. That\'s Injun for\r\nfires, folks say, because the Injuns used to build fires up there in the\r\nspring for some of their heathen doodads. Anyhow, up there in the\r\nmountains we see a tarnal power of quare things.\r\n\r\nYou call to mind the year we had the big thaw, about twelve years before\r\nthe war? You mind the blizzard that year? I heard tell it spread down\r\nmost to York. And at Fort Orange, the place they call Albany now, the\r\nHudson froze right over, so they say. But those York folks do a sight of\r\nexaggerating, I\'m told.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, when the ice went out there was an almighty good thaw all over,\r\nand when the snow run off Scuttock mountain there was a good-sized hunk\r\nof farmland in our valley went under water. The crick on my farm flowed\r\nover the bank and there was a foot of water in the cowshed, and down in\r\nthe swimmin\' hole in the back pasture wasn\'t nothing but a big gully\r\nfifty foot and more across, rushing through the pasture, deep as a lake\r\nand brown as the old cow. You know freshet-floods? Full up with sticks\r\nand stones and old dead trees and somebody\'s old shed floatin\' down the\r\nmiddle. And I swear to goodness, Parson, that stream was running along\r\nso fast I saw four-inch cobblestones floating and bumping along.\r\n\r\nI tied the cow and the calf and Kate--she was our white mare; you mind\r\nshe went lame last year and I had to shoot her, but she was just a young\r\nmare then and skittish as all get-out--but she was a good little mare.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, I tied the whole kit and caboodle of them in the woodshed up\r\nbehind the house, where they\'d be dry, then I started to get the\r\nmilkpail. Right then I heard the gosh-awfullest screech I ever heard in\r\nmy life. Sounded like thunder and a freshet and a forest-fire all at\r\nonce. I dropped the milkpail as I heard Marthy scream inside the house,\r\nand I run outside. Marthy was already there in the yard and she points\r\nup in the sky and yelled, "Look up yander!"\r\n\r\nWe stood looking up at the sky over Shattuck mountain where there was a\r\ngreat big--shoot now, I d\'no as I can call its name but it was like a\r\ntrail of fire in the sky, and it was makin\' the dangdest racket you ever\r\nheard, Rev\'rend. Looked kind of like one of them Fourth-of-July\r\nskyrockets, but it was big as a house. Marthy was screaming and she\r\ngrabbed me and hollered, "Hez! Hez, what in tunket is it?" And when\r\nMarthy cusses like that, Rev\'rend, she don\'t know what she\'s saying,\r\nshe\'s so scared.\r\n\r\nI was plumb scared myself. I heard Liza--that\'s our young-un, Liza\r\nGrace, that got married to the Taylor boy. I heard her crying on the\r\nstoop, and she came flying out with her pinny all black and hollered to\r\nMarthy that the pea soup was burning. Marthy let out another screech and\r\nran for the house. That\'s a woman for you. So I quietened Liza down some\r\nand I went in and told Marthy it weren\'t no more than one of them\r\nshooting stars. Then I went and did the milking.\r\n\r\nBut you know, while we were sitting down to supper there came the most\r\nawful grinding, screeching, pounding crash I ever heard. Sounded if it\r\nwere in the back pasture but the house shook as if somethin\' had hit it.\r\n\r\nMarthy jumped a mile and I never saw such a look on her face.\r\n\r\n"Hez, what was that?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Shoot, now, nothing but the freshet," I told her.\r\n\r\nBut she kept on about it. "You reckon that shooting star fell in our\r\nback pasture, Hez?"\r\n\r\n"Well, now, I don\'t \'low it did nothing like that," I told her. But she\r\nwas jittery as an old hen and it weren\'t like her nohow. She said it\r\nsounded like trouble and I finally quietened her down by saying I\'d\r\nsaddle Kate up and go have a look. I kind of thought, though I didn\'t\r\ntell Marthy, that somebody\'s house had floated away in the freshet and\r\nrun aground in our back pasture.\r\n\r\nSo I saddled up Kate and told Marthy to get some hot rum ready in case\r\nthere was some poor soul run aground back there. And I rode Kate back to\r\nthe back pasture.\r\n\r\nIt was mostly uphill because the top of the pasture is on high ground,\r\nand it sloped down to the crick on the other side of the rise.\r\n\r\nWell, I reached the top of the hill and looked down. The crick were a\r\nregular river now, rushing along like Niagary. On the other side of it\r\nwas a stand of timber, then the slope of Shattuck mountain. And I saw\r\nright away the long streak where all the timber had been cut out in a\r\nbig scoop with roots standing up in the air and a big slide of rocks\r\ndown to the water.\r\n\r\nIt was still raining a mite and the ground was sloshy and squanchy\r\nunder foot. Kate scrunched her hooves and got real balky, not likin\' it\r\na bit. When we got to the top of the pasture she started to whine and\r\nwhicker and stamp, and no matter how loud I whoa-ed she kept on\r\na-stamping and I was plumb scared she\'d pitch me off in the mud. Then I\r\nstarted to smell a funny smell, like somethin\' burning. Now, don\'t ask\r\nme how anything could burn in all that water, because I don\'t know.\r\n\r\nWhen we came up on the rise I saw the contraption.\r\n\r\nRev\'rend, it was the most tarnal crazy contraption I ever saw in my\r\nlife. It was bigger nor my cowshed and it was long and thin and as shiny\r\nas Marthy\'s old pewter pitcher her Ma brought from England. It had a\r\npair of red rods sticking out behind and a crazy globe fitted up where\r\nthe top ought to be. It was stuck in the mud, turned halfway over on the\r\nlittle slide of roots and rocks, and I could see what had happened, all\r\nright.\r\n\r\nThe thing must have been--now, Rev\'rend, you can say what you like but\r\nthat thing must have _flew_ across Shattuck and landed on the slope in\r\nthe trees, then turned over and slid down the hill. That must have been\r\nthe crash we heard. The rods weren\'t just red, they were _red-hot_. I\r\ncould hear them sizzle as the rain hit \'em.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the infernal contraption there was a door, and it hung\r\nall to-other as if every hinge on it had been wrenched halfway off. As I\r\npushed old Kate alongside it I heared somebody hollering alongside the\r\ncontraption. I didn\'t nohow get the words but it must have been for\r\nhelp, because I looked down and there was a man a-flopping along in the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nHe was a big fellow and he wasn\'t swimming, just thrashin\' and\r\nhollering. So I pulled off my coat and boots and hove in after him. The\r\nstream was running fast but he was near the edge and I managed to catch\r\non to an old tree-root and hang on, keeping his head out of the water\r\ntill I got my feet aground. Then I hauled him onto the bank. Up above me\r\nKate was still whinnying and raising Ned and I shouted at her as I bent\r\nover the man.\r\n\r\nWal, Rev\'rend, he sure did give me a surprise--weren\'t no proper man I\'d\r\never seed before. He was wearing some kind of red clothes, real shiny\r\nand sort of stretchy and not wet from the water, like you\'d expect, but\r\ndry and it felt like that silk and India-rubber stuff mixed together.\r\nAnd it was such a bright red that at first I didn\'t see the blood on it.\r\nWhen I did I knew he were a goner. His chest were all stove in, smashed\r\nto pieces. One of the old tree-roots must have jabbed him as the current\r\nflung him down. I thought he were dead already, but then he opened up\r\nhis eyes.\r\n\r\nA funny color they were, greeny yellow. And I swear, Rev\'rend, when he\r\nopened them eyes I _felt_ he was readin\' my mind. I thought maybe he\r\nmight be one of them circus fellers in their flying contraptions that\r\nhang at the bottom of a balloon.\r\n\r\nHe spoke to me in English, kind of choky and stiff, not like Joe the\r\nPortygee sailor or like those tarnal dumb Frenchies up Canady way,\r\nbut--well, funny. He said, "My baby--in ship. Get--baby ..." He tried to\r\nsay more but his eyes went shut and he moaned hard.\r\n\r\nI yelped, "Godamighty!" \'Scuse me, Rev\'rend, but I was so blame upset\r\nthat\'s just what I did say, "Godamighty, man, you mean there\'s a baby in\r\nthat there dingfol contraption?" He just moaned so after spreadin\' my\r\ncoat around the man a little bit I just plunged in that there river\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nRev\'rend, I heard tell once about some tomfool idiot going over Niagary\r\nin a barrel, and I tell you it was like that when I tried crossin\' that\r\nfreshet to reach the contraption.\r\n\r\nI went under and down, and was whacked by floating sticks and whirled\r\naround in the freshet. But somehow, I d\'no how except by the pure grace\r\nof God, I got across that raging torrent and clumb up to where the crazy\r\ndingfol machine was sitting.\r\n\r\nShip, he\'d called it. But that were no ship, Rev\'rend, it was some\r\nflying dragon kind of thing. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
It was a real scarey lookin\' thing but I\r\nclumb up to the little door and hauled myself inside it. And, sure\r\nenough, there was other people in the cabin, only they was all dead.\r\n\r\nThere was a lady and a man and some kind of an animal looked like a\r\nbobcat only smaller, with a funny-shaped rooster-comb thing on its head.\r\nThey all--even the cat-thing--was wearing those shiny, stretchy clo\'es.\r\nAnd they all was so battered and smashed I didn\'t even bother to hunt\r\nfor their heartbeats. I could see by a look they was dead as a doornail.\r\n\r\nThen I heard a funny little whimper, like a kitten, and in a funny,\r\nrubber-cushioned thing there\'s a little boy baby, looked about six\r\nmonths old. He was howling lusty enough, and when I lifted him out of\r\nthe cradle kind of thing, I saw why. That boy baby, he was wet, and his\r\nlittle arm was twisted under him. That there flying contraption must\r\nhave smashed down awful hard, but that rubber hammock was so soft and\r\ncushiony all it did to him was jolt him good.\r\n\r\nI looked around but I couldn\'t find anything to wrap him in. And the\r\nbaby didn\'t have a stitch on him except a sort of spongy paper diaper,\r\nwet as sin. So I finally lifted up the lady, who had a long cape thing\r\naround her, and I took the cape off her real gentle. I knew she was dead\r\nand she wouldn\'t be needin\' it, and that boy baby would catch his death\r\nif I took him out bare-naked like that. She was probably the baby\'s Ma;\r\na right pretty woman she was but smashed up something shameful.\r\n\r\nSo anyhow, to make a long story short, I got that baby boy back across\r\nthat Niagary falls somehow, and laid him down by his Pa. The man opened\r\nhis eyes kind, and said in a choky voice, "Take care--baby."\r\n\r\nI told him I would, and said I\'d try to get him up to the house where\r\nMarthy could doctor him. The man told me not to bother. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
"I dying," he\r\nsays. "We come from planet--star up there--crash here--" His voice\r\ntrailed off into a language I couldn\'t understand, and he looked like he\r\nwas praying.\r\n\r\nI bent over him and held his head on my knees real easy, and I said,\r\n"Don\'t worry, mister, I\'ll take care of your little fellow until your\r\nfolks come after him. Before God I will."\r\n\r\nSo the man closed his eyes and I said, _Our Father which art in Heaven_,\r\nand when I got through he was dead.\r\n\r\nI got him up on Kate, but he was cruel heavy for all he was such a tall\r\nskinny fellow. Then I wrapped that there baby up in the cape thing and\r\ntook him home and give him to Marthy. And the next day I buried the\r\nfellow in the south medder and next meetin\' day we had the baby baptized\r\nMatthew Daniel Emmett, and brung him up just like our own kids. That\'s\r\nall.\r\n\r\n_All? 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Mr. Emmett, didn\'t you ever find out where that ship really came\r\nfrom?_\r\n\r\nWhy, Rev\'rend, he said it come from a star. Dying men don\'t lie, you\r\nknow that. I asked the Teacher about them planets he mentioned and she\r\nsays that on one of the planets--can\'t rightly remember the name, March\r\nor Mark or something like that--she says some big scientist feller with\r\na telescope saw canals on that planet, and they\'d hev to be pretty near\r\nas big as this-here Erie canal to see them so far off. And if they could\r\nbuild canals on that planet I d\'no why they couldn\'t build a flying\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\nI went back the next day when the water was down a little, to see if I\r\ncouldn\'t get the rest of them folks and bury them, but the flying\r\nmachine had broke up and washed down the crick.\r\n\r\nMarthy\'s still got the cape thing. She\'s a powerful saving woman. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
We\r\nnever did tell Matt, though. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Might make him feel funny to think he\r\ndidn\'t really b\'long to us.\r\n\r\n_But--but--Mr. Emmett, didn\'t anybody ask questions about the\r\nbaby--where you got it?_\r\n\r\nWell, now, I\'ll \'low they was curious, because Marthy hadn\'t been in\r\nthe family way and they knew it. But up here folks minds their own\r\nbusiness pretty well, and I jest let them wonder. I told Liza Grace I\'d\r\nfound her new little brother in the back pasture, and o\'course it was\r\nthe truth. When Liza Grace growed up she thought it was jest one of\r\nthose yarns old folks tell the little shavers.\r\n\r\n_And has Matthew ever shown any differences from the other children that\r\nyou could see?_\r\n\r\nWell, Rev\'rend, not so\'s you could notice it. He\'s powerful smart, but\r\nhis real Pa and Ma must have been right smart too to build a flying\r\ncontraption that could come so far.\r\n\r\nO\'course, when he were about twelve years old he started reading folks\'\r\nminds, which didn\'t seem exactly right. He\'d tell Marthy what I was\r\nthinkin\' and things like that. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
He was just at the pesky age. Liza Grace\r\nand Minnie were both a-courtin\' then, and he\'d drive their boy friends\r\ncrazy telling them what Liza Grace and Minnie were a-thinking and tease\r\nthe gals by telling them what the boys were thinking about.\r\n\r\nThere weren\'t no harm in the boy, though, it was all teasing. But it\r\njust weren\'t decent, somehow. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
So I tuk him out behind the woodshed and\r\ngive his britches a good dusting just to remind him that that kind of\r\nthing weren\'t polite nohow. And Rev\'rend Doane, he ain\'t never done it\r\nsence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ May 1954.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.
