The ladies\' slightest\r\n    wish was his command...._\r\n\r\n     BY CHARLES L. FONTENAY\r\n\r\n\r\nHerbert bowed with a muted clank--indicating he probably needed oiling\r\nsomewhere--and presented Alice with a perfect martini on a silver tray.\r\nHe stood holding the tray, a white, permanent porcelain smile on his\r\nsmooth metal face, as Alice sipped the drink and grimaced.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a good martini, Herbert," said Alice. "Thank you. But, dammit, I\r\nwish you didn\'t have that everlasting smile!"\r\n\r\n"I am very sorry, Miss Alice, but I am unable to alter myself in any\r\nway," replied Herbert in his polite, hollow voice.\r\n\r\nHe retired to a corner and stood impassively, still holding the tray.\r\nHerbert had found a silver deposit and made the tray. Herbert had found\r\nsand and made the cocktail glass. Herbert had combined God knew what\r\natmospheric and earth chemicals to make what tasted like gin and\r\nvermouth, and Herbert had frozen the ice to chill it.\r\n\r\n"Sometimes," said Thera wistfully, "it occurs to me it would be better\r\nto live in a mud hut with a real man than in a mansion with Herbert."\r\n\r\nThe four women lolled comfortably in the living room of their spacious\r\nhouse, as luxurious as anything any of them would have known on distant\r\nEarth. The rugs were thick, the furniture was overstuffed, the paintings\r\non the walls were aesthetic and inspiring, the shelves were filled with\r\nbooktapes and musictapes.\r\n\r\nHerbert had done it all, except the booktapes and musictapes, which had\r\nbeen salvaged from the wrecked spaceship.\r\n\r\n"Do you suppose we\'ll ever escape from this best of all possible manless\r\nworlds?" asked Betsy, fluffing her thick black hair with her fingers and\r\ninspecting herself in a Herbert-made mirror.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see how," answered blond Alice glumly. "That atmospheric trap\r\nwould wreck any other ship just as it wrecked ours, and the same\r\nmagnetic layer prevents any radio message from getting out. No, I\'m\r\nafraid we\'re a colony."\r\n\r\n"A colony perpetuates itself," reminded sharp-faced Marguerite, acidly.\r\n"We aren\'t a colony, without men."\r\n\r\nThey were not the prettiest four women in the universe, nor the\r\nyoungest. The prettiest women and the youngest did not go to space. But\r\nthey were young enough and healthy enough, or they could not have gone\r\nto space.\r\n\r\nIt had been a year and a half now--an Earth year and a half on a nice\r\nlittle planet revolving around a nice little yellow sun. Herbert, the\r\nrobot, was obedient and versatile and had provided them with a house,\r\nfood, clothing, anything they wished created out of the raw elements of\r\nearth and air and water. But the bones of all the men who had been\r\naspace with these four ladies lay mouldering in the wreckage of their\r\nspaceship.\r\n\r\nAnd Herbert could not create a man. Herbert did not have to have direct\r\norders, and he had tried once to create a man when he had overheard them\r\nwishing for one. They had buried the corpse--perfect in every detail\r\nexcept that it never had been alive.\r\n\r\n"It\'s been a hot day," said Alice, fanning her brow. "I wish it would\r\nrain."\r\n\r\nSilently, Herbert moved from his corner and went out the door.\r\n\r\nMarguerite gestured after him with a bitter little laugh.\r\n\r\n"It\'ll rain this afternoon," she said. "I don\'t know how Herbert does\r\nit--maybe with silver iodide. But it\'ll rain. Wouldn\'t it have been\r\nsimpler to get him to air-condition the house, Alice?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s a good idea," said Alice thoughtfully. "We should have had him\r\ndo it before."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHerbert had not quite completed the task of air-conditioning the house\r\nwhen the other spaceship crashed. They all rushed out to the smoking\r\nsite--the four women and Herbert.\r\n\r\nIt was a tiny scoutship, and its single occupant was alive.\r\n\r\nHe was unconscious, but he was alive. And he was a man!\r\n\r\nThey carted him back to the house, tenderly, and put him to bed. They\r\nhovered over him like four hens over a single chick, waiting and\r\nwatching for him to come out of his coma, while Herbert scurried about\r\ncreating and administering the necessary medicines.\r\n\r\n"He\'ll live," said Thera happily. Thera had been a space nurse. "He\'ll\r\nbe on his feet and walking around in a few weeks.

"\r\n\r\n"A man!"

murmured Betsy, with something like awe in her voice. "I could\r\nalmost believe Herbert brought him here in answer to our prayers."\r\n\r\n"Now, girls," said Alice, "we have to realize that a man brings\r\nproblems, as well as possibilities."\r\n\r\nThere was a matter-of-fact hardness to her tone which almost masked the\r\nquiver behind it. There was a defiant note of competition there which\r\nhad not been heard on this little planet before.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" asked Thera.\r\n\r\n"I know what she means," said Marguerite, and the new hardness came\r\nnatural to her. "She means, which one of us gets him?"\r\n\r\nBetsy, the youngest, gasped, and her mouth rounded to a startled O.\r\nThera blinked, as though she were coming out of a daze.\r\n\r\n"That\'s right," said Alice. "Do we draw straws, or do we let him\r\nchoose?"\r\n\r\n"Couldn\'t we wait?" suggested Betsy timidly. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
"Couldn\'t we wait until he\r\ngets well?"\r\n\r\nHerbert came in with a new thermometer and poked it into the unconscious\r\nman\'s mouth. He stood by the bed, waiting patiently.\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t think we can," said Alice. "I think we ought to have it all\r\nworked out and agreed on, so there won\'t be any dispute about it."\r\n\r\n"I say, draw straws," said Marguerite. Marguerite\'s face was thin, and\r\nshe had a skinny figure.\r\n\r\nBetsy, the youngest, opened her mouth, but Thera forestalled her.\r\n\r\n"We are not on Earth," she said firmly, in her soft, mellow voice. "We\r\ndon\'t have to follow terrestrial customs, and we shouldn\'t. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
There\'s only\r\none solution that will keep everybody happy--all of us and the man."\r\n\r\n"And that is...?" asked Marguerite drily.\r\n\r\n"Polygamy, of course. He must belong to us all."\r\n\r\nBetsy shuddered but, surprisingly, she nodded.\r\n\r\n"That\'s well and good," agreed Marguerite, "but we have to agree that no\r\none of us will be favored above the others. He has to understand that\r\nfrom the start."\r\n\r\n"That\'s fair," said Alice, pursing her lips. "Yes, that\'s fair. But I\r\nagree with Marguerite: he must be divided equally among the four of us."\r\n\r\nChattering over the details, the hard competitiveness vanished from\r\ntheir tones, the four left the sickroom to prepare supper.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter supper they went back in.\r\n\r\nHerbert stood by the bed, the eternal smile of service on his metal\r\nface. As always, Herbert had not required a direct command to accede to\r\ntheir wishes.\r\n\r\nThe man was divided into four quarters, one for each of them. It was a\r\nvery neat surgical job.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                   END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _If Worlds of Science Fiction_ June\r\n    1958.
