Their local god--a huge, intelligent lichen which covered a\r\nfifth of the habitable surface of Phogiu II, was dying. Naturally,\r\nthey sent for Benedict Breadfruit. He took one look at the lichen and\r\nsaid: "It is obvious that the fungi part of this intelligent symbiotic\r\norganism is in good health. The other part, however--"\r\n\r\nHe gave it a shot of vitamins and a chlorophyll pill. The Great Lichen\r\nimmediately spruced up and began delivering its deep pronunciamentos\r\nwith the proper punctilio.\r\n\r\n"What was wrong with it?" asked one of the natives.\r\n\r\n"Nothing serious," said Benedict Breadfruit.

"All it needed was an\r\nalgae buttress."\r\n\r\n                                                   --GRANDALL BARRETTON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         _Through Time and Space With Benedict Breadfruit: II_\r\n\r\nThe accepted method for removing space lice from the hull of a ship\r\nwas by sandblasting, but the boys around the space docks noticed that\r\nBenedict Breadfruit\'s shiny hull was not pitted either by space lice or\r\nby sandblasting. Breadfruit used hydrogen cyanide to remove the pests,\r\nbut he had never told anyone about it.\r\n\r\n"Come, Breadfruit," said one of the spaceport officials, "tell us how\r\nyou remove your burden of pediculous pests!"\r\n\r\nBreadfruit gestured at his HCN generator.

How can a machine in such horribly battered condition\r\nmove about?"\r\n\r\nBenedict Breadfruit looked sorrowfully at his offspring. "Haven\'t you\r\never seen junk amble, Junior?"\r\n\r\n                                                   --GRANDALL BARRETTON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         _Through Time and Space With Benedict Breadfruit: IV_\r\n\r\n"But what will they do with the robot when it becomes too decrepit to\r\nmove?" persisted the boy.\r\n\r\nBreadfruit pointed to a large vat of bubbling acid in the public\r\nsquare. "They\'ll throw him in the pool, yonder, son."\r\n\r\n                                                   --GRANDALL BARRETTON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         _Through Time and Space With Benedict Breadfruit: V_\r\n\r\nOn the planet Tenta I, plants of the melon and related families were\r\nso rare that the king himself had issued a royal fiat to protect them.\r\nNot knowing this, Benedict Breadfruit\'s young son started to pick a\r\npumpkin. Fortunately, his father stopped him in time.\r\n\r\n"But _why_ can\'t I pick a pumpkin, father?" asked the child.\r\n\r\n"It would be a violation of the Gourd Edict, son."\r\n\r\n                                                   --GRANDALL BARRETTON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         _Through Time and Space With Benedict Breadfruit: VI_\r\n\r\n"On the planet Toupher VI," said Benedict Breadfruit in his address\r\nto the members of the Institute for Twenty-First Century Studies,\r\na group specializing in ancient history, "the natives keep time by\r\nmeans of cords which have knots tied along their length at precisely\r\nmeasured intervals. Since the material from which these cords are made\r\nis remarkably even in its rate of burning, it is possible to tell the\r\nexact hour by noticing how many knots have been burned after one end\r\nhas been lit."\r\n\r\n"What is this remarkable contraption called?" asked one of the members.\r\n\r\n"Whay, naturally," said Benedict Breadfruit in his best British accent,\r\n"it would be a knot clock."\r\n\r\n                                                   --GRANDALL BARRETTON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        _Through Time and Space With Benedict Breadfruit: VII_\r\n\r\nThe Black Beast of Betelgeuse, although horrible in aspect, was really\r\na very pleasant fellow when you got to know him, as Benedict Breadfruit\r\ndid. But because of his alienness he was forbidden to go to Earth by\r\na Galactic Space Lines regulation forbidding tickets to be sold to\r\n"horrible monsters".\r\n\r\n"It\'s an unfair law," said the Black Beast. "You\'re a man of some\r\nimportance, Benedict; couldn\'t you do something about it?

"\r\n\r\nBreadfruit nodded.

One day a group of Hoogahtu\r\ncalled upon Benedict Breadfruit.\r\n\r\n"We are," said their spokesman, "planning to build an old-fashioned\r\nEarth-type house for our group. The living quarters for the males and\r\nfemales will be on the first and second floors. The Temple of Love, as\r\nwe call it, will occupy the top floor, just under the roof. Knowing\r\nyour abilities with language, we would like for you to give us a name\r\nfor our Temple."\r\n\r\n"Orgiastic top floor, eh?" asked Breadfruit.\r\n\r\n"That\'s right."\r\n\r\n"A hot-pants attic, as it were?" said Breadfruit.\r\n\r\n"If you insist, yes," said the spokesman.\r\n\r\n"A libidinous area just under the roof, one might say."\r\n\r\n"That\'s what we said," agreed the Hoogahtu.\r\n\r\n"In other words, a lewd loft?" persisted Breadfruit.\r\n\r\n"Most emphatically," said the Hoogahtu spokesman.\r\n\r\nBenedict Breadfruit shook his head, baffled for the first time in his\r\nlife. "Gee, fellas, I just can\'t think of a damn thing."\r\n\r\n                                                   --GRANDALL BARRETTON\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Editor\'s Note: In this final episode of Benedict Breadfruit the\r\n    author\'s name is revealed._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
