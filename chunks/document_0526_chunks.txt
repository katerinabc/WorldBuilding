ST. CLAIR\r\n\r\n    _The peculiar quality of deep space is hard to put into words. On\r\n    earth, however isolated we are, whatever happens to us, we are yet\r\n    on our home planet. The man afloat on the life raft in the Pacific,\r\n    delirious with exposure and loneliness, floats nonetheless on an\r\n    element whose very saltiness relates it to the red sea water in his\r\n    veins. The flyer forced down in the desert curses the rising sun;\r\n    but the same sun that sucks water out of his drying tissues is the\r\n    glorious temporal lord on whose radiation all terrestrial life\r\n    processes depend. On earth our extremest terrors, our ultimate\r\n    catastrophes, are yet like the blows of a familiar hand. It is very\r\n    different in deep space._\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n                     Planet Stories January 1952.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Are there any more of them?" Alice asked McFeen when he came back from\r\ntwo hold.\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nAlice\'s mouth opened in a soundless O. Her hand went to her breast.\r\nAfter a moment she picked up the comb and began pulling it again\r\nthrough her brittle hair. "How many more?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t count them. Hyra are hard to count. Quite a lot."\r\n\r\nThe comb caught on a tangle. Alice put it down unsteadily. "I wish we\'d\r\nnever brought them," she said abruptly. "I wish we\'d never started\r\non this trip. I hate those things. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
They\'re uncanny. They give me the\r\ncreeps. What do you suppose is making them increase like that?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know." McFeen\'s lean, ill-humored face was more than usually\r\nmorose. "Listen, Alice...."\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"That isn\'t the worst of it. I found a hole in the mesh of their cage."\r\n\r\n"You\'re trying to frighten me," Alice said pitiably after a second.\r\n"There couldn\'t be a hole in beryllium mesh."\r\n\r\n"There was, though. I had to patch it up the best way I could. And ...\r\nand ... Alice, there was an eroded spot in the side of the hull."\r\n\r\n"You mean there was a spot eaten into on the side of our ship?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. I plated it over with the auto-weld. It was near their cage."\r\n\r\nThe comb snapped in Alice\'s hand. She stared at McFeen. "I told you!"\r\nshe said finally. Her voice had risen several notes. "I told you it was\r\ndangerous! 

=== Chunk 3 ===
You wouldn\'t listen to me. You knew everything.\r\n\r\n"When I said maybe there was a reason why the Biologic Survey wouldn\'t\r\nrelease any Hyra to fight the blight on Varro, you said the Survey was\r\nnothing but a bunch of fat-cat office-holders who had to make a lot of\r\nfool regulations to look like they were earning their salaries. You\r\ntalked big about how it was your duty to help the poor bosula ranchers\r\non Varro fight the blight. You tried to pretend money wasn\'t the\r\nreason why you were smuggling the Hyra out to them. You knew all the\r\nanswers, everything would be all right! 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Oh, you were Mr. Know-it-all!\r\n\r\n"Now we\'re in deep space with an eroded hull. In deep space! I told you\r\nsomething would happen! I to--"\r\n\r\nMcFeen slapped her hard across the mouth. "Keep that gabby trap of\r\nyours shut," he said threateningly. He hung over her menacingly for a\r\nmoment. And then, relenting (after all, he and Alice had been through\r\na lot together), "Stow it," he said. "No matter whose fault it is,\r\ncomplaining isn\'t going to help us now. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
We\'ve got to figure a way out\r\nof this."\r\n\r\nAlice put up one hand and fingered her swelling lips. She nodded.\r\n"Yes," she whispered, "I guess we have."\r\n\r\nMcFeen began to walk up and down the little cabin. "The way I figure\r\nit," he said, frowning, "is, this is the first time anybody\'s had any\r\nHyra in deep space. They were all right as long as we were in the\r\nsystem; it wasn\'t until we hit deep that they began to increase. The\r\ndeeper in we go, the faster their rate of increase is.\r\n\r\n"Hyra come from Pluto, and when the Biologic Survey tried them out on\r\ngerms of the blight from Varro and found they controlled it, the tests\r\nwere made on Terra. Still inside the system, I mean. And under system\r\nconditions Hyra increase so slowly that for one to bud off was a real\r\nrarity.\r\n\r\n"The way I figure it, conditions are different out here in deep. Maybe\r\nit\'s because inside the system there\'s always some gravity. Even off\r\nthe planets, I mean. We don\'t notice it, but it stands to reason it\r\nmust be there. When there\'s no gravity at all, the Hyra start to breed.\r\nAnd when they breed they give off a ... a kind of gas, or something,\r\nthat attacks beryllium."\r\n\r\n"But we\'ve got gravity on the ship," Alice said through her swollen\r\nlips. "We don\'t go floating around."\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t really gravity, Alice, it\'s just from the centrifuge."\r\n\r\n"Oh. Well, if it isn\'t, what is real gravity?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know exactly," McFeen confessed. "I never was good at\r\ntheoretical stuff. Some kind of electro-magnetic force, I guess."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlice nodded uncomprehendingly. "Couldn\'t we--couldn\'t we get rid of\r\nthe Hyra, Mac?" she asked timidly. On impulse she put out her hand and\r\ntouched his sleeve. "We could think up some way of killing them if we\r\ntried, I guess. You\'re awfully smart. And then we could start back\r\nhome. I\'m so scared, honey. Those Hyra scare me so."\r\n\r\nMcFeen turned on her fiercely. "You blasted fool," he said, "don\'t you\r\nknow how it is with us? 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Is something the matter with your head? I\'ve\r\nbeen blacklisted. There isn\'t a place in the system I could get a job.\r\nThere isn\'t a man in the system I could borrow money from. If this trip\r\nfails I\'m sunk, done for, finished. Get rid of the Hyra! You brainless,\r\nblathering idiot! Do you want to starve?"\r\n\r\nAlice shrank into herself. "But, Mac--"\r\n\r\n"If we can get through to Varro with the Hyra we\'ve got, the big bosula\r\ngroups will make us rich. We can have everything we\'ve ever wanted. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Now\r\nshut up.

=== Chunk 8 ===
"\r\n\r\nHe went to a locker and began getting equipment out of it. Alice\r\nwatched him, running her tongue over her swollen lips. "What are you\r\ngoing to do, Mac?" she asked at last.\r\n\r\n"Rig up an electro-magnet around the Hyra," he said without turning.\r\n"It might help. It\'s got to help."\r\n\r\nIt didn\'t work. Whether or not McFeen\'s theory was at fault, the\r\napparatus he rigged up around the cage of Hyra did no good. He tried\r\nchemical solutions, sprays, hard and soft radiations--nothing helped.\r\nHe took to spending most of his time in two hold, trying desperately,\r\nwith the help of the auto-weld, to keep the eroded patches on the\r\nhull under control. Without telling Alice, he made experiments\r\ndesigned to "get rid" of at least some of the Hyra. These too failed.\r\nThe silicious, gelatinous bodies of the Hyra were extremely hard to\r\ndestroy. Short of methods which would have endangered the whole ship,\r\nthere was nothing he could do.\r\n\r\nMcFeen\'s natural moroseness was changing rapidly into an inflammable\r\ndesperation when, quite abruptly, the increase of the Hyra stopped. At\r\nfirst he was incredulous. He tried over and over to count those in the\r\ncage, and gave up in disgust. More convincing was the evidence of the\r\nhull; no more eroded patches were appearing. For some twenty-four hours\r\nhe held on to his incredulity; then he allowed himself to be conquered\r\nby relief.\r\n\r\nHe went to Alice with the news and found her as incredulous as he\r\nhad been. He had to take her into two hold and show her the hull\'s\r\ngleaming, intact sides piece by piece before she would be convinced.\r\nThen she began to giggle in hysterical relief.\r\n\r\n"Poor old Hyra," she said, "poor old things. I guess I was pretty\r\nmean about them, Mac. I\'m sorry. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
Poor old things!" She looked toward\r\nthe crowded Hyra cage and then, rather hastily, away again. "But\r\neverything\'s going to be all right now, isn\'t it, Mac? Now they\'ve\r\nstopped increasing, everything\'s going to be all right."\r\n\r\n"You bet it is," McFeen said expansively. "Nothing more to worry about.\r\nSay, listen, Alice...."\r\n\r\n"Yes?" She was still looking obliquely toward the Hyra cage.\r\n\r\n"What do you say we go back to the cabin and have a little drink? To\r\ncelebrate."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a swell idea," Alice answered warmly. "I always said you were\r\nsmart, Mac. Let\'s go celebrate." She glanced once more toward the Hyra\r\nand then followed him out of the hold.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBack in the cabin, McFeen broke out a bottle of soma concentrate. He\r\nand Alice drank it slowly, with much inconclusive speculation as to\r\nthe reason why the Hyra had ceased to breed. When the soma was gone,\r\nMcFeen brought out a bottle of phlomis. Usually he and Alice began to\r\nquarrel bitterly when they reached the second bottle in their drinking\r\nbouts, but this time they were both feeling too good for it to happen.\r\nThey went on from bottle to bottle, drink after drink, in a thickening\r\nhaze of moist, maudlin goodfellowship. Finally they both passed out.\r\nMeantime the ship slid on and on into the deep.\r\n\r\nMcFeen awoke some ten hours later with his sinuses thundering. Liquor\r\nalways did that to him. He had a dim, uncomfortable feeling that at\r\nsome point in their drinking he had insisted on telling Alice what he\r\nhad really done with the 1,500 I.U.\'s she thought had been stolen.\r\nEven more faintly he seemed to remember her responding with a full and\r\nequally indiscreet account of how she had spent the three months he had\r\nbeen on Uranus. Oh, well, it didn\'t really matter. Neither he nor Alice\r\nwas the kind of drinker who remembers details.\r\n\r\nHe sat on the edge of his bunk for a moment, gathering strength, and\r\nthen groped his way over to the aid chest. He got out two sobrior pills\r\nand swallowed them. As his head began to clear, he looked around for\r\nAlice. She was lying on her back in her bunk, snoring heavily, with a\r\nlong strand of her bleached blonde hair lying across her face. She\'d be\r\nout for a while yet, he guessed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, he\'d better go see how the cage of Hyra was. It was always\r\npossible that they\'d begun to breed again. Or was he feeling too\r\nqueasy to look at them now? Any tendency to queasiness was bound to be\r\nincreased by looking at Hyra. No, he\'d better not put it off. Still\r\nwalking rather unsteadily, he left the cabin and went into two hold.\r\n\r\nHis first impression was that the Hyra cage had grown. Surely it was\r\nmuch larger than it had been. Then he realized that the size of the\r\ncage was unchanged; it seemed larger because it was emptier. There were\r\nfewer Hyra in it than there had been before.\r\n\r\nThere were no visible holes in the mesh. It was impossible. McFeen,\r\ncold sober now, knelt down beside the cage and inspected the mesh\r\ncentimeter by centimeter. Everywhere it was whole and unbroken; he\r\ndidn\'t think a flea could have got out through it.\r\n\r\nHe turned on the floodlights and gave the hold an equally thorough\r\nscrutiny. No, no Hyra. Not a Hyra anywhere.\r\n\r\nLeaving aside the question of how they had got out through the\r\nmesh, where had they gone to? Number two hold, like the others, was\r\nhermetically sealed. And he knew no Hyra had gone past him when he had\r\nbroken the seal on entering. The whole thing was impossible. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
He must be\r\nimagining it. After all, he hadn\'t counted them.\r\n\r\nMcFeen leaned against a bulkhead and pressed his fingers to his head.\r\nThe pain in his frontal sinus was jumping again. Maybe he was still a\r\nlittle bit buzzed. He didn\'t think he was, but it was possible. That\r\nwould account for a lot.\r\n\r\nHe looked at the cage once more. Wait, now, he had it. The reason\r\nit looked so much emptier was that the Hyra (ugh, how he loathed\r\nthem--he\'d never let Alice see how much) were all jammed together at\r\none end, heaped up on one another, like a pile of oozing, pupilless\r\neyes. Naturally the cage looked bigger when the Hyra were piled up like\r\nthat. McFeen almost laughed in his relief.\r\n\r\nHe sealed the hole up carefully and went back to the cabin, his\r\nfootfalls ringing unevenly. Alice was sitting up in her bunk. She had\r\nwashed her face and pushed her hair out of her eyes. She nodded shortly\r\nat him when he came in. After a while she got up and began opening some\r\nsoup.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey both felt better when they had eaten. Alice revived sufficiently\r\nto comb her hair and spray some make-up on. The pain began to die away\r\nin McFeen\'s head. He\'d been a fool to get so excited over nothing. All\r\nthe same, he was going into the hold and have another look at the Hyra.\r\nHe pushed back his chair.\r\n\r\n"Where you going, Mac?" Alice asked. She was gathering up the remains\r\nof their meal and putting them in the disposer.\r\n\r\n"Two hold."\r\n\r\n"They aren\'t increasing again, are they?" she asked in quick alarm.\r\n\r\n"No, nothing like that."\r\n\r\nThis time there was no possible doubt. The heap of Hyra was less\r\nthan half the size it had been. In the time since he had left the\r\nhold--certainly not more than three-quarters of an hour--it had gone\r\nway, way down. He could count the Hyra without any difficulty now.\r\nThere were either sixteen or seventeen.\r\n\r\nMcFeen\'s heart began pounding wildly. His chest felt so constricted\r\nhe could hardly breathe. For a moment he tried to fight his panic, to\r\nreason with himself. Then he turned and ran for Alice.\r\n\r\nShe came rather unwillingly, understanding from his hoarse incoherence\r\nonly that the Hyra were not increasing any more. Even when she saw the\r\nalmost empty cage she was not alarmed. "Why, honey, there must be a\r\nhole there you haven\'t found," she said reasonably. "A hole or some--"\r\nshe fell silent suddenly.\r\n\r\n"Mac," she said in a quite different voice.\r\n\r\n"Hunh?" McFeen had been trying to count the Hyra; it seemed to him that\r\nthere was one less in the cage than there had been when he went to the\r\ncabin just now for Alice.\r\n\r\n"Mac, where\'s that shadow coming from?"\r\n\r\nThe fear in her voice infected McFeen with instant irritability. "What\r\nshadow?" 

=== Chunk 11 ===
he demanded. 

=== Chunk 12 ===
"What are you talking about? Haven\'t we got\r\ntrouble enough? Be quiet! What are you starting in on shadows for?"\r\n\r\n"Mac...." Alice had to swallow and lick her lips before she could go\r\non. "Look at it. 

=== Chunk 13 ===
There. In the corner of the cage." She pointed with\r\none hand.\r\n\r\nMcFeen\'s eyes followed the gesture. For an unbeatable moment he looked\r\nsquarely at the thing in the corner of the cage. His heart gave a\r\nhorrible lurch, like a horse trying to unseat the rider on its back.\r\n"It\'s nothing," he said desperately. "Nothing, nothing! Just a shadow.\r\nThe bulkhead\'s casting it."\r\n\r\n"Was the shadow here when you were in the hold before?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. Yes, of course it was. It must have been."\r\n\r\nAlice stood quite motionless for an instant. Her elbows were pressed\r\nto her sides, her hands against her chest, in the feminine posture of\r\nresistance and defense. "Turn the floodlights on, Mac," she said.\r\n\r\nThe lights snapped on. The hold was illuminated from all sides. It\r\nwas an illumination as shadowless as that of an operating theater, as\r\nbright as the noon of a terrestrial day. The shadow in the corner of\r\nthe Hyra cage was quite unaffected by it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlice drew a long, quavering sigh. She put both her hands on McFeen\'s\r\nforearm; he could feel her trembling. "Mac, honey," she said very\r\nsoftly, "you know such a lot, you\'re so smart. Won\'t you tell me where\r\nthe shadow\'s coming from? Won\'t you please tell me what\'s making it?"\r\n\r\nMcFeen looked at her. His eyes were wild. "I don\'t know!" he said in\r\na high, breaking voice. "I tell you, I don\'t know! Stop asking me\r\nquestions! Stop badgering me! I\'m getting out of here!" 

=== Chunk 14 ===
He pulled\r\nagainst her for a moment. Then he tore loose and ran.\r\n\r\n"Mac, honey," Alice said when they were back in the cabin once more\r\nwith the hold sealed behind them, "I think I know what that thing\r\nin the cage is." She spoke with surprising calmness. Though she was\r\ntrembling a good deal she had, all things considered, come out of the\r\nhold in better condition than McFeen had.\r\n\r\n"There\'s nothing in the cage," McFeen answered, shuddering. He uncapped\r\na phlomis bottle and drank from it. Drops of the liquor were running\r\ndown his chin. "There\'s nothing in the cage."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes ... Mac, I think it\'s a Vanderlark."\r\n\r\nHe put the bottle down. The drink had helped him. "A Vanderlark? What\'s\r\nthat supposed to be?"\r\n\r\n"I guess there\'s only one of it," Alice corrected herself. She rubbed\r\nher lips for a moment with a handkerchief. "I wish my mouth wouldn\'t\r\nshake," she said petulantly. "It makes it hard to talk.\r\n\r\n"The Vanderlark\'s a--a thing--that lives in deep space. It\'s made out\r\nof black. One of my boy friends who was a pilot in deep told me about\r\nit once when he\'d been drinking. He was awfully afraid of it.\r\n\r\n"I guess it\'s everywhere, really. Bill said it was everywhere, always,\r\nin all spaces and all times. I don\'t understand that very well, do you,\r\nMac?

=== Chunk 15 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Go on," McFeen said. He turned the phlomis bottle around, studying it\r\nwith haggard concentration.\r\n\r\n"Anyway, deep is where the Vanderlark is more. Most of the time it\r\ndoesn\'t bother anybody. 

=== Chunk 16 ===
But if you call it--it--it comes."\r\n\r\n"Call it? What do you mean? We never called that thing."\r\n\r\n"We didn\'t mean to call it," Alice said, "but maybe.... Or maybe it was\r\nthe Hyra called it. I mean, when we hit deep space and they began to\r\nincrease. Maybe when they increased they made a--a quiver in space that\r\nattracted it. They\'re not alive in the way other things are. They\'re\r\ndifferent. Or maybe a part of them has always been where the Vanderlark\r\nis."\r\n\r\nMcFeen rubbed his hands over his face. He got another bottle of\r\nphlomis from the locker, uncapped it, and then put it aside without\r\ntasting it. "What are we going to do, Alice?" he asked humbly.\r\n\r\nAlice stood up, smoothing the folds of her wrinkled dress. In this\r\nmoment she had an odd dignity. "I\'m awfully scared, Mac," she said as\r\nif in explanation. "The best thing I can think of is to put the Hyra\r\ncage in the life raft. And then jet the raft off away from the ship.\r\nMaybe the Vanderlark will follow it. When the Hyra are gone, maybe the\r\nshadow will leave us alone."\r\n\r\nThere were only three Hyra left in the cage. The shadow had filled all\r\nexcept the cage\'s extreme end. McFeen looked at it and then averted his\r\ngaze. His face was so white that the brownness of his skin looked like\r\ngreasepaint laid on a mask. Alice was standing behind him. He muttered\r\nsomething. He laid hold of the cage and tried to lift it up.\r\n\r\nThere was an instant\'s resistance. Then the shadow welled up\r\nenormously, in a horrible puffing-out of black. McFeen was left\r\nholding the top edge of the cage. All the rest was gone.\r\n\r\nHe stood looking stupidly at the metal for a moment and then dropped it\r\non the deck. He began to back away. He was screaming on a single high\r\nnote. He hadn\'t stopped screaming when, without any perceptible motion,\r\nthe blackness, the limitless blackness, closed over him.\r\n\r\nAlice turned and ran. The life raft was aft of two hold; she couldn\'t\r\nhave got through to the raft even if she had thought of it.\r\n\r\nShe ran from the hold to the cabin, from the cabin into the control\r\nroom. The Vanderlark found her there, pressed flat against the metal\r\nof the prow, mumbling "No no no," over and over and trying to push her\r\nway out through the ship with her hands. Quietly and easily it extended\r\nitself and made her a part of it.\r\n\r\nThen there was silence. After a while the Vanderlark flowed over the\r\nwhole ship. And then there was nothing there at all but the Vanderlark.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
