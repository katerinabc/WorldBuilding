For him this was the worst part of the day. The\r\nfighting was done until tomorrow and the enemy casualties were being\r\nbrought in through the gate below. Their bodies were piled in awful\r\nabandon on the big flat-bed trucks.\r\n\r\nA phrase from another war came to his mind. Walking wounded. There were\r\nno walking wounded in this war. They came in on the trucks, still and\r\ntangled, or they didn\'t come in at all.\r\n\r\nHe couldn\'t have merely wounded one of the enemy, as soldiers used\r\nto. The thought of inflicting such an injury, in the old conventional\r\nway, was obscene. To strike through the breast into the heart....\r\nHe shuddered with a trembling that came up through the thighs and\r\ncontracted his stomach.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant had come to stand beside him.\r\n\r\n"You shouldn\'t watch, if it bothers you," the lieutenant said.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all right, sir," the sergeant said. He looked down again.\r\n\r\n"We had a good day. Three hundred, the colonel said."\r\n\r\n"That\'s good." The sergeant laughed sardonically. "Are we winning?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s hard to say. We\'re not losing."\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t we, sir?" The sergeant spoke bitterly. "Aren\'t they? Aren\'t we\r\nall?"\r\n\r\n"Look, sergeant--" the lieutenant began. Then he shrugged. The sergeant\r\nwas older than he was by seven or eight years. There was no need to\r\ngive him an orientation lecture. He reached in his pocket and took out\r\na fresh pack of cigarettes. He opened it.

"Have one. A shipment just\r\ngot in."\r\n\r\n"Thanks." The sergeant took a cigarette. He stared at it and the\r\nfingers holding it trembled.

"Look at it," he said hollowly. "Look at\r\nthe freakin\' thing!"\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant looked at it, then at the front of the pack. _Ruby tips\r\nto match your lips_, it said under the brand name.\r\n\r\n"What are they doing to us?" the sergeant said. He crumpled the\r\ncigarette in his fist and threw it down and ground it under his boot.\r\n"Isn\'t it hard enough?"\r\n\r\n"It must be a mistake," the lieutenant said. He sounded shaken, too.\r\n"Because of the shortage, maybe. Unless it\'s a fifth column trick. Like\r\nthe rumor about them not going to wake up again."\r\n\r\n"It is just a rumor, isn\'t it?" the sergeant said. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
His voice was almost\r\npleading. "We just freeze them for--for the duration, don\'t we? Don\'t\r\nwe, lieutenant? Because I couldn\'t go on if they were really dead.\r\nNobody could."\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant spoke sharply. "Snap out of it, sergeant! It\'s just\r\npropaganda. I\'m surprised at an old hand like you falling for it."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not, sir. We couldn\'t really kill them, could we? It\'d be suicide,\r\nwouldn\'t it? It\'s not total war, is it?"\r\n\r\n"Not total, no. There\'ll be an end to it one day, and then a beginning\r\nagain. I know it\'s hard, but it\'s the only way."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe last of the big trucks had rumbled in from the battlefield. The\r\nsergeant watched the gate close in the fading light. Beloved enemy, he\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n"Three hundred today," he said aloud. "And one was my personal\r\ncontribution. My platoon was strung out behind me, and she came up over\r\nthe hill--"\r\n\r\n"Sergeant!"\r\n\r\n"She was mine. I got her personally. I aimed slow and held the sight on\r\nher. Then I let go. It was almost like--"\r\n\r\n"Sergeant!" The lieutenant was trembling. "The third person singular is\r\nprohibited! You know that, sergeant!"\r\n\r\nThe sergeant was calm. "Yes, sir." He looked at the young officer. "But\r\nI feel better for having told about it. I\'m all right now, sir. I hope\r\nI didn\'t upset you."\r\n\r\n"No," the lieutenant said. "No. We\'ll forget about it."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll have one of those cigarettes now, sir, if you don\'t mind. It\r\ndoesn\'t matter about the tip, now that it\'s dark."\r\n\r\n"Well...." The lieutenant hesitated. "I was going to send them back to\r\nQuartermaster, with a report. But all right.

Here. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
I\'ll have one, too."\r\n\r\nAs the sergeant lit them he could see a bit of the red tip in the\r\nlieutenant\'s mouth. He dragged deep on his own, pretending he could\r\ntaste lipstick.\r\n\r\n"Lieutenant," he said. "It doesn\'t matter where you hit them, does it?\r\nI mean it doesn\'t hurt them at all?"\r\n\r\n"No," the lieutenant said. "No, it doesn\'t matter. They just go to\r\nsleep."\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad." After a while the sergeant said, "I guess I\'ll hit the\r\nsack."\r\n\r\n"It\'s still early."\r\n\r\n"Yes. But I like to get up early. There\'s always a line in the\r\nlatrine--at the shaving bowls."\r\n\r\n"Combat troops don\'t have to shave," the lieutenant said.\r\n\r\n"I know. But we do. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
We all do."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
