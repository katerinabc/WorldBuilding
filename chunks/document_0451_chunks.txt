Above him he could see the flat\r\npink half-sphere of the sky. Now, _that_ bothered him. He squinted up\r\nat it for several more minutes before deciding it was the color that\r\nwas wrong somehow. Harvey hunched up into a sitting position, yawned\r\nwidely, and gazed around. Thirty yards to his left a stand of blue and\r\nyellow trees, triangular in shape, effectively blocked the horizon.\r\nIn front of him a tapered cylinder, balanced gracefully on its nose,\r\nperformed the same function. To his right ... there _was_ no horizon!\r\n\r\n"God damn," said Harvey Crane.\r\n\r\nHe crawled the ten feet or so to the Edge of the World and looked down.\r\nThe all-pervading rosiness swirled below. Harvey tightened his belt to\r\nhold his stomach in place, inched far back from the Edge, and stood\r\nshakily up.\r\n\r\nIt was then that he noticed the girl.\r\n\r\nShe stood with hands on hips, critically appraising the ship.\r\n\r\n_Aha! The ship! That\'s what it is_, Harvey thought triumphantly.\r\n\r\n"I see you tried to land it again," the girl said dryly. _Again?_\r\nHarvey wondered, but said nothing. She walked over to the ship, lifted\r\nthe gargantuan structure by a wingtip, and scowled back at him.\r\n\r\n"Well, don\'t just stand there like an idiot. Come give me a hand."\r\n\r\nHe was surprised at the ease with which they handled the rocket. They\r\nsoon had it righted, and the girl stood back and gazed at it worryingly.\r\n\r\n"There," she said. It sounded final. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
A look of vague annoyance crossed\r\nher pretty features. She shook her long, brown hair into place,\r\nflicked an imaginary speck of dust off her spotless white trousers,\r\nrolled the sleeves of her blouse up, and ... erased the ship.\r\n\r\n"_Hey!_" shouted Harvey wildly, "You can\'t do that!" He stared in dumb\r\namazement at the fading after-image of the ship. Beyond it, the long\r\nupward slope of the yellow, grassy hill was crowned by a huge Castle.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be silly, Harvey dear. Come on, it\'s playtime." He followed her,\r\nfor some reason, up the slope to the Palace.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPlaytime, Harvey learned, consisted of a pleasant swim in the purple\r\nwaters of the Palace moat, followed by a delicious feast of some sort\r\nof orange fruit faintly resembling wax-covered ladybugs. They--he and\r\nthe girl and a pet animal with a disturbing tendency to change shape\r\nevery three seconds--were seated in a rather large floral garden (there\r\nwas a faunal one somewhere nearby, Harvey learned), gazing. That is\r\nto say, the girl was gazing at the garden, the animal at Harvey, and\r\nHarvey at _her_. It must have been a pleasant experience all around,\r\nfor they started laughing after a few minutes.\r\n\r\n"Say," Harvey said, standing. "I don\'t have the faintest idea who I am,\r\nwhere I am, or why, but ... _who are you?_"\r\n\r\nShe bit her lip, and said with forced gaiety, "My goodness, Harvey.\r\nDon\'t you remember? No, I suppose you don\'t. Well, I\'m ... Dana. Tell\r\nme, Harvey," she walked over to him and looked into his eyes. "How much\r\n_do_ you remember?"\r\n\r\nHarvey stopped smiling, frowned, rubbed a hand through his black hair.\r\n"Not much," he admitted, staring out the Palace window. "I keep having\r\nthe feeling that if I _try_ hard enough ... but, I\'m not sure I want to\r\nremember," he finished, puzzled.\r\n\r\n"Now, Harvey," Dana laughed and put her arms around him. "You\'re here\r\nnow, and that\'s all that matters. You\'ve _al_ways been here." Harvey\r\nlooked down at her fondly.\r\n\r\n"Tsk tsk," he pronounced. "Now you _have_ aroused my curiosity." He\r\nkissed her, felt an imperious snap at his pantleg, and turned to find\r\nan amazing likeness of a dragon turning a burning gaze at his exposed\r\ncalf. "Hey!" he shouted, and jumped.\r\n\r\n"_Tim_othy!" Dana shouted, and the dragon reverted to her pet animal.\r\nShe turned back to Harvey. "I\'m so sorry, Harvey. Timothy is really\r\nvery fond of you."\r\n\r\n"He has an odd way of showing it," Harvey growled.\r\n\r\nThe pinkness of the outer world suddenly changed to a deep aquamarine.\r\n\r\n"Oh dear," sighed Dana. "Night already, and I haven\'t made up the bed.\r\nI suppose we can sleep on the cot tonight," she said tentatively.\r\n\r\n"We?"\r\n\r\n"Oh. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
I forgot. You just got here today, didn\'t you," she said absently,\r\na little rankled. "Well, you can have the cot tonight, Harvey. We have\r\n_so_ much to do the rest of our lives."\r\n\r\nHarvey felt so suddenly overcome with weariness he didn\'t think to ask\r\nher just what it was they had so much of. He followed her docilely down\r\na blue-lighted corridor and out onto a small balcony. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
A low cot, lined\r\nwith silk and complete with canopy, reposed in the exact center of the\r\nporch. He turned to say good-night to Dana and found her already gone.\r\nThe little Changeling sat panting in her place, its multi-morphic form\r\nvibrating slightly. Harvey grinned down at its angry dwarfish stare.\r\n\r\n"Jealous, eh?" he said.\r\n\r\nThe bathroom was off to the right side of the balcony. Harvey found he\r\nneeded nothing but a drink of water--it was purple. His chin showed no\r\nsigns of erupting in its usual forest of thick, dark hairs. He swore\r\ngood-naturedly at this (it had been his intention to grow a beard), put\r\nhis razor away, and undressed for bed. A pair of loose, soft pajamas of\r\nneutral color lay across the cot. They fit him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe aqua sky showed thousands of vari-shaped blobs that whirled crazily\r\noverhead; he at first mistook them for clouds. Gradually it became\r\napparent that they were moons, each a different color. Somehow the\r\nglinting gold one seemed familiar to him. Finally he gave up trying to\r\nchase down a forgotten memory and looked past them to the stars.\r\n\r\nNow, what were stars? Harvey stared at the powder sprinkled across\r\nthe sky. He _must_ know what they are; he knew what they were called,\r\ndidn\'t he? Or had he just imagined the name--made it up himself?\r\n\r\n"Greeeeeep," the Changeling said softly. Harvey switched his gaze from\r\nthe sky to the out-stretched form of a bear rug lying on the floor\r\nbeside the cot. "Greeeeeep." 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Hmmm. The Changeling\'s body was barely\r\nvibrating. It must be asleep.\r\n\r\nHarvey watched the animal for several minutes. A faint blue breeze\r\nsighed through the parapets of the Palace mounting above him. Below, in\r\nthe courtyard, he heard the stealthy rattle of chains.\r\n\r\n_Ghosts?_ His mind rejected the possibility at once. He had never\r\nbelieved in them before--why start now? His mind worked furiously as\r\nthe sound halted. Bridge. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Drawbridge. He recalled seeing a drawbridge\r\nacross the moat when Dana had led him swimming yesterday ... only,\r\n_they_ had entered through a small door set flush with the surface of\r\nthe water. Someone must be letting the drawbridge down, and it had to\r\nbe Dana. Harvey raised up on his elbow and carefully put a foot over\r\nthe edge of the cot. He crept to the railing of the balcony and looked\r\ndown eighty feet of blue emptiness to the yellowness of the hill. Down\r\nit, a cloaked figure followed a crooked path to the Edge of the World.\r\n_Dana._\r\n\r\nSomething sparked an irrational fear in Harvey as the figure grew\r\nsmaller with distance. He wrapped his robe about him, slipped into\r\nhis flight shoes (_there_ was something to examine later. Where had\r\nhe gotten those words?

=== Chunk 7 ===
), and dodged into a hallway. All roads led to\r\nthe courtyard, Harvey knew. At least, all that _he_ had covered. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
He\r\ncast an apprehensive glance over his shoulder to see if the Changeling\r\nhad followed him, then wondered at his apprehension. His memory of\r\nexistence went back less than twenty-four hours, and this bothered him.\r\nHe should have thought more about what the _ship_ was, rather than\r\n_where_ he was, he thought self-deprecatingly. But Dana had to be going\r\nsomewhere, and in this world, bounded so tightly by Infinity, there was\r\nnothing left to do but wonder where the hell she was going. He halted\r\nin the courtyard, located the path to the drawbridge, and found the\r\ndrawbridge closed.\r\n\r\n_Yeep!_ Harvey thought. Either Dana was already back, or she had\r\nsomeone or some_thing_ here to draw the bridge up after her departure.\r\nHe whirled, saw nothing, and ran back to the garden, retracing their\r\nsteps of yesterday to the small door unhinging out onto the moat. He\r\nstripped down to his trunks and slid out into the chill purple of the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt became immediately obvious that swimming was _not_ a nighttime\r\nsport. The water was extremely cold (Harvey twice bumped into floating\r\ncakes of ice), and harbored a species of life that, while seemingly\r\nharmless, certainly _felt_ horrible. He pulled himself out on the\r\nfar side and sat chattering for several minutes, massaging his legs.\r\nSomewhere on that small plain of grass, dear old Dana was up to\r\nsomething. And Harvey felt it imperative that he know _what_.\r\n\r\nHe shuddered to his feet and gaped back at the Castle. In the crazy\r\nlights of the whirling moons, shadows danced and played in the deep\r\ngouges of balconies and alcoves. The ramparts themselves stabbed into\r\nthe night sky like the many-pointed noses of rockets on a spacefield.\r\n\r\n_Spacefield? Rockets? What?_\r\n\r\nA dim wave of remembrance washed over Harvey. He clenched his fists and\r\ntried to think. He tore at the black veil over the past with mental\r\nfingers, and it resisted. He opened his eyes and found himself running\r\ndown the esplanade toward the spot where he had regained consciousness\r\nthe day before. He slowed to a walk, hoping the crazily darting,\r\nheterochromatic moons would hide his mobile shadow among the moving\r\nshadows of the fixed plants and rocks.\r\n\r\nNear the place where he had first met her, Dana halted and looked\r\nbehind her. Harvey darted into the dubious shelter of a triangle tree\r\nand stopped, waiting breathlessly for her call of discovery. Nothing\r\nhappened, and a few moments later he chanced a look.\r\n\r\nA row of three eyes stared coldly in his face.\r\n\r\nHarvey jerked back, shuddered to fight back a yell, and ran madly\r\ndown the hill toward Dana, but she was no longer in sight. For one\r\nwild second Harvey thought she had disappeared over the Edge. A look\r\nconfirmed the fallacy of the notion. But behind him, the three floating\r\nred eyes stared impassively. Angrily, he wrenched them from the air and\r\nflung the glowing coals out into Infinity, and had the satisfaction of\r\nwatching them dwindle into nothing. He had no idea what they were; all\r\nhe knew was he hadn\'t liked them.\r\n\r\nDisappointed at having lost Dana, he started back up the hill toward\r\nthe Castle.\r\n\r\n_Thud!_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHarvey picked himself up off the ground and explored the night air in\r\nfront of him with wary hands. He encountered solid surface and felt\r\nhis way around it, astonished. It was the ship! Dana had done nothing\r\nbut render it invisible yesterday! He located the rocket tubes and\r\nthe heavy arches of the landing fins, and looked up when he judged he\r\nshould be under the airlock. A sudden, frightful flood of memory poured\r\nover him.\r\n\r\nMy God! _Earth! The Universe! Me!_\r\n\r\n"Harvey?"\r\n\r\nSilence. He squatted down under the rocket\'s firing flange, hidden from\r\nview of the airlock.\r\n\r\n"Harvey dear, is that you?" A light sprang out of the air twenty\r\nfeet above the ground. Dana stood in breath-taking silhouette in a\r\nrectangular frame of familiar white. Harvey realized it was the first\r\ntime since ... since _the crash_! ... since the crash that he had seen\r\n_white_ light. White, the symbol of truth. He straightened, still\r\nunder the flange, and waited while Dana decided to come down and look\r\naround. He would soon get the truth.\r\n\r\n"Har_vey_?"\r\n\r\nHe tensed as her shapely legs appeared, carefully feeling for the rungs\r\nof an invisible ladder. When she reached the ground, Harvey stepped\r\naround the exhaust flange and flung himself on her. They landed in the\r\nyellow turf, and Harvey found without surprise he faced a formidable\r\nopponent. Whatever the force that had enabled her to lift the ship\r\nyesterday proved equally useful against flesh; but Harvey found he also\r\npossessed new strength. His eyes fell on the tiny metal case strapped\r\nto her waist.\r\n\r\nA Matter Disorganizer!\r\n\r\n"_Harvey!_ Stop it, Harvey! _You don\'t know what you\'re doing!_" she\r\nscreamed. He laughed harshly and finally succeeded in wrenching the\r\nlittle metal box away from her.\r\n\r\n"You were going to destroy the ship," he shouted incredulously. "In\r\nGod\'s name, _why_?"\r\n\r\nShe stepped back from him, tears glistening in her eyes. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
"To keep ...\r\nthis from happening," she panted. She turned and yelled something at\r\nthe Castle.\r\n\r\nIn the weird moonlights, a huge flying monster dragged itself from the\r\ntopmost pinnacle and came in a banshee wail toward Harvey. He put down\r\nhis fear and aimed the Matter Disorganizer carefully. The huge yawning\r\nmouth gaped out at him as he pulled the actuator. The banshee scream\r\nstopped abruptly; the monster vanished. Dana fell to her knees sobbing.\r\n"You\'ve killed him! You\'ve killed Timothy," she cried.\r\n\r\nHarvey turned back to the ridiculous rectangle of white radiance\r\nsuspended in mid-air and adjusted the MD\'s energy span. The solid metal\r\nwalls of the rocket reared into the night sky.\r\n\r\n"All right, Dana," Harvey said coldly, turning to the kneeling woman.\r\n"Where am I, and what\'s going on here?"\r\n\r\n"I--I suppose I should tell you now," she choked out, standing without\r\nhis help. Harvey felt suddenly cold. The night wind had ceased, and a\r\nblue heatlessness settled over the yellow field. Even the moons lost\r\nsome of their giddy fervor.\r\n\r\n"Go on. I\'m listening." He felt his voice soften, and rebelled. He had\r\nbeen subservient for too long in this crazy world, he realized. He felt\r\nsomething else was necessary. "I remember now," he stated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDana sucked in her breath and stared at him longingly. "Oh Harvey,\r\ndarling. I\'ve lost you so many times already. Must we go through it\r\nagain?" 

=== Chunk 10 ===
she said sadly. Harvey said nothing. Her shoulders sagged.\r\n"Very well. It isn\'t a long story. You remember Earth, Harvey? Your\r\nEarth?"\r\n\r\n"I remember."\r\n\r\n"You know why you came ... here?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Look at your ship, Harvey. It\'s old. It is _very_ old. I\'m going to\r\ntell you something. Something you already know, but won\'t admit to\r\nyourself...."\r\n\r\nA frightened look appeared in Harvey\'s eyes.\r\n\r\n"Well, go _on_. _Tell_ me," he shouted impatiently, fearfully.\r\n\r\n"After your ship left Earth, Harvey, it jumped the Light Barrier. But\r\nyou and the others hadn\'t counted on the forces involved; everything\r\nbut the _man_ was designed to take that jump. _You never came out of\r\nOverdrive, Harvey. You\'re still in that ship, and you\'ll never wake\r\nup!_" She laughed/cried at Harvey\'s twisted face.\r\n\r\n"You\'re crazy!" he roared hoarsely. "You\'re crazy! I re_mem_ber! _I_\r\nknow where I am, _and_ how to get back!"\r\n\r\n"Take a look around you, Harvey Crane," Dana laughed at him\r\nhysterically. "Do you think a world such as this _could ever really\r\nexist_?\r\n\r\n"All this, Harvey," she gestured at the chunk of land, the Castle, and\r\nthe moons--"They\'re just symbols. This island: your mind; the world\r\nedge is the end of Reality. Out there, the moons--_they are insanity_."\r\n\r\n"But you _wanted_ me to stay here. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
Why did you change your mind?" He\r\nstared at her accusingly.\r\n\r\n"If you wish, you can ascribe motives to my actions," Dana said\r\ntiredly. "But they are your motives, not mine. Harvey, I\'m just \'real\'\r\nin your imagination. In Reality--the only Reality--I\'m back on Earth,\r\nwaiting. Harvey ... go back. _I want you so!_"\r\n\r\nHarvey stared at her, incredulous. "But _you_. Who are _you_?" he\r\nblurted.\r\n\r\nShe bit her lip and gazed at him sadly.\r\n\r\n"I," she said, her voice tremulant, "am your wife."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHarvey\'s memory tore back to a green planet called Earth ... forgotten\r\nfaces, places. He _looked_ at Dana for the first time, and in that\r\ninstant of full recognition, she began to dissolve.\r\n\r\n"Harvey," she pleaded, "Wake up. You\'ve got to face Reality before it\'s\r\ntoo late. Please ..." she sobbed into nonexistence.\r\n\r\nHarvey wheeled toward the ship and fled up the ramp. "No! 

=== Chunk 12 ===
No! This is\r\nReality!" he shouted. He stared up at the insane island-moons swirling\r\nin the sky; the soft, sourceless aqua of the air; the incredible bulk\r\nof the Castle on the Edge of Infinity, and he felt on the brink of\r\nHell. Something was going to happen. Harvey\'s breathing was loud in the\r\nthundering silence.\r\n\r\nThe Castle suddenly wrenched from the island and lifted ponderously\r\ninto the air, an immense ghastly shadow looming closer.... Harvey\r\nscreamed.\r\n\r\nHe spun around, intending to use the Matter Disorganizer on the Castle\r\nas it swung faster and faster toward the ship. The MD slipped from his\r\ngrasp and sailed high into the air, toward the....\r\n\r\n_No! No!_\r\n\r\nUp and up....\r\n\r\n_No! No!_\r\n\r\nUp and up....\r\n\r\n_No!_--\r\n\r\n"_Please, Harvey ... you\'re trapped in your--in your imagination.\r\nYou\'ve got to face REALITY._"\r\n\r\nCLANK\r\n\r\nIt hit the ship.\r\n\r\nThe Universe dissolved in a vivid flash of white fire, and still Harvey\r\ncould hear Dana\'s whispered pleading....\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
