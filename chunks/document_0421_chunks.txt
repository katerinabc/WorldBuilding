I\r\nhad come to this barbaric era in the proper time, indeed, but millions\r\nof miles removed from it in space. It had been only after an annoying\r\nsearch that I had discovered Earth, jetted toward it in my space-drive\r\nsuit and had come down out of the skies to land on this tiny, deserted\r\nisland in the middle of an empty sea.\r\n\r\nBut it was incredible luck that had brought me there. For I had found\r\nexactly what I needed--a man who would give me information, clothing\r\nand an identity--and then die, and obliterate the record of my\r\ninterference with the course of events!\r\n\r\nI, Thom Ra, walked toward him. Feeble though he was, he opened his eyes\r\nand stared at me.\r\n\r\n"Thank Heaven!" he whispered, in the thick, hideous language of that\r\nera. "I couldn\'t have lasted much longer if you hadn\'t found me." He\r\nfell back and smiled at me with heartfelt gratitude, and for a moment\r\nI felt a wild, fleeting impulse to help him, to save his life. But of\r\ncourse, I dared not interfere. For that would change the shape of the\r\nfuture, and that meant destruction for me....\r\n\r\nWhen I blasted off from the island, a little later, he was dead, and I\r\nwas wearing his uniform--and his name.\r\n\r\nHe gave me information before he died, and I had no trouble locating\r\nthe spot I wanted. I waited till dark before landing a few hundred\r\nyards from the war-dome. Then I hid my space-drive suit in a cluster\r\nof ancient trees, and walked into the building that housed the most\r\nmurderous weapon of all time.\r\n\r\nThe sentry challenged me, of course, but I was ready for him. After a\r\nquick look at my stolen credentials he sheathed his ray pistol.\r\n\r\n"Pass, sir," he said, and I walked in, no longer as Thom Ra, but\r\nidentified as a Captain San Requa of the Intelligence Service.\r\n\r\nAt once I saw the atom-rocket. It was on the other side of the great\r\nchamber, nestled in a wheeled cradle, ready to be rolled out to the\r\nblast-off point. Hurrying technicians swarmed about it with last-minute\r\nchecks. I walked over, saluted the officer who was supervising and\r\nbegan to witness events which I had crossed so tremendous a span of\r\nyears to observe.\r\n\r\nThe atom-rocket was a long, silvery torpedo, a cluster of tubes at the\r\nrear, a snub-nosed warhead at the front. A panel in the side of it was\r\nopen, and technicians were setting dials according to the figures read\r\noff by a white-haired old officer with the insignia of a general on his\r\ncollar.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI listened in awe and reverence, straining to note and remember\r\neverything that occurred. To think that I was actually present at the\r\nclimactic moment of the legendary War of Annihilation! It was the most\r\nthrilling moment of my life. Almost I forgot to curse Master Lys and\r\nhis duplicity as I watched.\r\n\r\nAlmost--but not quite. For the thing was too fresh in my mind, and I\r\nwas aware that I was still in danger.\r\n\r\nIt had begun with a routine notice that my preparatory work had been\r\napproved, and that I was authorized to enter a theme in ortho-history\r\nfor my final Citizenship Ratings. The theme, I saw with a sinking\r\nheart, was the War of Annihilation.\r\n\r\nI had hurried to Master Lys, my instructor, sure that there was an\r\nerror.\r\n\r\n"Master, you give me an impossible task," I had said. "The theme\r\nregulations are that I must make a \'real and complete contribution to\r\nhuman knowledge.\' But how can I? We have so pitifully few records of\r\nthe War of Annihilation--all of them have been studied, and analyzed,\r\nand worked over for thousands of years. There is no way for me to add\r\nto what has been written already!"\r\n\r\nHe cackled at me in his insufferable Tri-Alpha way.\r\n\r\n"There is a way," he mumbled, peeping at me out of his rheumy old eyes.\r\n\r\nIt took me a moment to realize what he meant.\r\n\r\n"The time-belts!" And Master Lys nodded.\r\n\r\nWell, I argued with him, of course. The time-belts were too dangerous;\r\nnot one time-traveler in ten returned from the past, even when their\r\nprojects were as recent as a hundred years ago. And the farther into\r\nthe past one ventured, the more certain it became that return would be\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nFor although the mechanism of the time-belts could be trusted and there\r\nwas no physical menace that the conductor-screens or the katonator-guns\r\ncould not cope with, there was the ever-present danger of Fan-Shaped\r\nTime itself.\r\n\r\nIt was the First Law of Chronistics: Our era is the product of\r\neverything that occurred in the past. Should anything in the past be\r\nchanged, our age would also be changed. Oh, it would continue to exist,\r\nbut in a parallel branch of time--and there was no way of passing\r\nfrom one branch to another. And if a traveler into the past should\r\n_interfere_ in the course of events, he would be bound to the new\r\ntime-stream his actions created, and the unlucky traveler would never\r\nbe able to return.\r\n\r\nThe branches of Fan-Shaped time could never be retraced. The man who\r\ninterfered with the space-time matrix, displacing even a comma in the\r\ngreat scroll of time, would be cut off from his origin forever.\r\n\r\nThe danger was too great. I refused to accept the assignment, even\r\nthough I knew it would mean I could never rise to the status of\r\nTri-Alpha citizenship which was otherwise my right.\r\n\r\nBut then I heard about Elren--lovely, adored Elren Dri--and I could no\r\nlonger refuse.\r\n\r\nFor Elren\'s Mating Indices were posted, and she was a Tri-Alpha\r\nherself! Then I understood what had been in Master Lys\' mind when\r\nhe set that impossible task for me. For I knew that the gnarled,\r\nworm-eaten old wreck had dared to covet my Elren! Loving me, she could\r\nnever be his. But with me out of the way he might have a chance.\r\n\r\nI accepted the assignment. Master Lys secured a time-belt for me--he\r\nwas willing enough to help at my execution--and I began my perilous\r\njourney through time.\r\n\r\nI came back to my surroundings with a start. Something was wrong!\r\n\r\nSubconsciously I had been studying the atom-rocket, and now I was\r\njolted out of my reveries as I realized that it did not look as it\r\nshould have.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe ortho-history books were clear on one fact: Venus had been\r\ndestroyed in the War of Annihilation by means of a hydrogen-chain\r\nreaction, the most deadly atom blast known. Atoms of hydrogen, under\r\nthe influence of gamma-particle bombardment, coalesced to form atoms of\r\nhelium--and all the incalculable power represented by the odd fraction\r\nof mass left over was released in the form of free energy.\r\n\r\nBut the atom-rocket before me seemed to be nothing more than a simple\r\nnuclear-fission affair! Where were the photon-exciters? The gamma-ray\r\nbombardment equipment?\r\n\r\nOf course, even a fission bomb could do a good deal of local damage,\r\nas shown in the first atom-bombed cities during the Little Wars of the\r\nearly Twentieth Century. But, unless our nuclear science was in error,\r\nit could not set off a chain reaction of the type that had destroyed\r\nthe Venusian colonies. Was I in the wrong place?\r\n\r\nAlarmed, I shoved my way closer to the rocket, staring at it. It was a\r\ncrude, primitive affair, of course, and it was hard for me to identify\r\nits parts. I examined it with frantic curiosity--and abruptly I found\r\nmyself in peril!\r\n\r\nOne of the technicians I had pushed aside was staring at me, eyes\r\nfilled with suspicion. I caught his gaze and cursed myself for having\r\nacted so rashly. Desperately I strove to think of a way to allay his\r\nsuspicions, but it was too late.\r\n\r\n"What are you doing?" the technician demanded. "Who are you?"\r\n\r\nI tried to conciliate him.\r\n\r\n"Captain San Requa\'s my name," I said, using the name on the stolen\r\nidentity papers. "I am--" But I got no farther than that. My accent\r\ngave me away.\r\n\r\n"He\'s a spy!" roared the technician. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
"Help!" And a dozen ray-pistols\r\nflashed out of their holsters as the men around us were galvanized into\r\naction.\r\n\r\nI lost my head. Terrified, I grabbed for the safety belt concealed\r\nbeneath my stolen tunic, touched the button that controlled my\r\nconductor screen. The screen shimmered into instant life, and not a\r\nmoment too soon. Rays from the weapons pointed at me flashed from all\r\nsides, sparked against the opalescent curtain of the screen and were\r\ndissipated.\r\n\r\nI was safe--but only for an instant.\r\n\r\nFor I had made my second great mistake. I was too close to the\r\natom-rocket. My conductor screen grazed the warhead itself!\r\n\r\nIts energies surged through the unstable elements in the warhead; a\r\nwarning bell sprang into clamorous life. The group around me froze in\r\ntheir tracks, mouths open, faces mirroring fright and disbelief--and\r\nthe frightful power of the strained atoms within the warhead began to\r\ngrind toward nuclear fission!\r\n\r\nThere was only one thing to do, and a poor choice it was! But in a\r\nmoment the warhead would explode, and of me and my mission, and the\r\nwhole future of Earth, nothing would be left but a puff of fiery vapor.\r\n\r\nQuickly I dropped the shield of my conductor screen. Trusting that my\r\nluck would hold, and the men around me would be too dazed to fire their\r\nweapons again, I drew my katonator, set it at _drain_, focused it on\r\nthe atomic warhead.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Drawing my katonator, I focused the twin violet beams on\r\nthe warhead of the atomic bomb.]\r\n\r\nThe twin violet beams sprang out and impinged on the silvery metal,\r\npierced it and sucked the heart from the seething mass of erupting\r\nmatter within. Blinding energies were drawn from those toppling atomic\r\nstructures, surging through the carrier-beam of the katonator into\r\nthe photon-pack cartridges at my waist. I had an instant\'s fear as I\r\nwondered if the storage pack would hold all the mighty energies of the\r\nwarhead, far greater than the maximum load for which it was designed.\r\n\r\nBut lightnings of static electricity played about my head, dissipating\r\nbrilliantly but harmlessly into the air, and in an instant the danger\r\nwas over. The bursting energies of the warhead had been drawn out, and\r\nthe mass of matter inside it was inert.\r\n\r\nBefore me lay the atom-rocket, harmless, dead.\r\n\r\nI had destroyed Earth\'s most potent weapon!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI give those ancients credit for bravery. Dangerous though I must have\r\nseemed, they closed in on me without firing their weapons. Meekly I\r\nraised my arms over my head.\r\n\r\nThe white-haired general blazed hatred at me from his pale eyes.\r\n\r\n"Who are you?" he demanded.\r\n\r\nI shrugged. Carefully I phrased my words in their outlandish tongue.\r\n\r\n"I am a--a visitor from the future," I said. "I regret the accident\r\nthat just happened more than I can say."\r\n\r\n"Regret it?" he blazed. "Hah! You\'ll regret it twice as much when you\r\nface the firing squad!"\r\n\r\nI spread my hands helplessly. In truth, death had no terrors for me\r\nnow. A firing squad would seem almost a blessing--for I had destroyed\r\nthe bomb that would have blasted Venus. Whatever happened now, the\r\nfuture before me was changed--and in a changed future I had no place,\r\nand my Elren would not exist!\r\n\r\n"Take him out and shoot him," the general cried.\r\n\r\nI turned to go to death, almost eagerly. In my heart I whispered:\r\n\r\n"Elren! Elren, my lost love!"\r\n\r\nThe technician who had unmasked me interfered.\r\n\r\n"Wait!" he begged. "Let me question him, sir. Perhaps he\'s telling the\r\ntruth."\r\n\r\nThe general glowered. "What\'s the difference? He\'s wrecked the bomb!"\r\nBut he hesitated and finally said, "All right. Question him. The harm\'s\r\ndone anyhow."\r\n\r\nSunk in despair I scarcely heard the other officer\'s sharp queries, but\r\nhe was hesitant and I told him whence I had come, and why. He looked at\r\nme incredulously.\r\n\r\n"But the bomb?" he demanded. "What did you do to it?"\r\n\r\nI patted the photon-pack cartridges strung along my belt. "I had to\r\ndrain it," I said. "It was about to explode--"\r\n\r\n"Drain it? How?

=== Chunk 3 ===
"\r\n\r\n"With the katonator." I explained to him how the energies of the\r\nexploding atoms were drawn off through the katonator-beams and trapped\r\nin the photon-pack.\r\n\r\nHe stared at the tiny power cells, eyes wide but showing a sudden glint\r\nof hope.\r\n\r\n"Can you take that energy out again and send it into another object?"\r\n\r\n"You mean to energize the atom-bomb again?" I said. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
"No, of course not."\r\n\r\nHe was shaking his head. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
"I mean something else," he said. "Can you\r\nsend them across fifty million miles of space?"\r\n\r\nI stared at him, fascinated and afraid.\r\n\r\n"I dare not interfere," I whispered.\r\n\r\n"But, you _have_ interfered," he yelled. "You\'ve wrecked our chance to\r\nwin this war. You\'ve got to help us!"\r\n\r\nI stepped back, bewildered. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
What he said was true enough. Yet all my\r\ntraining, all the warnings of Elren and Master Lys, said over and over:\r\nYou must not interfere!\r\n\r\nYet I had interfered already; I had started a new time-sequence by\r\ndestroying Earth\'s chance to wipe out Venus. If I could neutralize that\r\nact by helping them now, perhaps there would be a chance.\r\n\r\n"I will show you how to use the katonator," I said weakly.\r\n\r\nSilently I adjusted it, slipped the belt off and handed it to him. He\r\nled me outside to where stars blazed in a black night. He looked upward\r\nhesitantly, pointed to a brilliant blue planet.\r\n\r\n"Is that it?" he asked one of his companions. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
The man nodded. Carefully\r\nhe took aim, pressed the trigger as I had showed him.\r\n\r\nLightnings roared again! The twin violet beams leaped from the muzzle\r\nof the weapon, howled up into the heavens. In a fraction of a second\r\nthe photon-pack was drained and the pyrotechnic display died away. All\r\nwas silent.\r\n\r\nOne of the officers raced back into the building, pounded the keys of a\r\ncalculator. He returned almost at once.\r\n\r\n"At this distance it will take just under nine minutes for light to\r\nmake the round trip," he said.\r\n\r\nThe officer who had fired the katonator whirled to confront me.\r\n\r\n"Suppose I missed?" he cried in sudden alarm. "It is so far--a fraction\r\nof a second of arc would make the beam miss entirely."\r\n\r\nI shook my head. "The beam fans out," I explained. "And a planet has\r\nmass and the photons are attracted by gravity. Even if they should\r\nmiss, the attraction of the planet would draw them into it."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe nodded and was silent. Silence cloaked us all--a hundred ancients\r\nand myself, all staring up into a mysterious night.\r\n\r\nNine minutes passed as slowly as nine terrible years. But by and by the\r\nhands of my chronometer completed their revolutions.\r\n\r\nSuddenly we saw the katonator-beams strike.\r\n\r\nAbove us a new sun blazed forth, kindling like the striking of a\r\ncosmic match. Night fled around us, and day came flaring up into\r\nnoonday brilliance, and beyond. Heat poured down upon us, brilliant\r\nrays of sunlight more intense than I had ever seen. The dome behind me\r\nsparkled and glistened in the incredible radiations from the stricken\r\nplanet millions of miles away, and for a moment I could almost feel\r\nthe fierce actinic waves of ultra-violet, cosmics and a thousand other\r\nsuper-spectral radiations.\r\n\r\nThen the peak was reached, and the light began to fade as all the\r\nhydrogen was transmuted and consumed. In a moment the flare of energies\r\nwas gone, and the pale blue planet had become a glowing orange coal.\r\n\r\nWe had seen a billion persons dying in a planetary suttee.\r\n\r\nThe vastness of the dead stunned me. I found that I was sobbing, almost\r\nweeping as I felt myself stained with a cosmic guilt.\r\n\r\nThe officer who had destroyed a billion lives glanced at me in full\r\nunderstanding of what he had done. He placed a hand on my shoulder,\r\nstrangely comforting.\r\n\r\n"It couldn\'t be helped," he said in a voice that surged with emotion.\r\n\r\nI nodded bleakly. It couldn\'t be helped. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
"It was for the sake of\r\nEarth," I said, blindly seeking justification. "Earth was destined to\r\nwin, in my time-sequence, and I had interfered--I had to correct the\r\nconsequences of my blunder--"\r\n\r\nI stopped. Wild astonishment burst through the tragic mask on the face\r\nof the officer. He drew back his arm as though he had found himself\r\nembracing an adder.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter?" I asked in astonishment.\r\n\r\nHe stared at me with dawning comprehension--and pity. "Say that again!"\r\nhe whispered.\r\n\r\n"Why--I said I had to correct my mistake. I had interfered, and\r\nthe time-traveler who interferes maroons himself hopelessly. I had\r\ndestroyed your weapon against Venus--yet Venus had to be obliterated,\r\nor else I had no chance of return. I was lost--and now, perhaps, I may\r\nhave a chance to get back."\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
There was compassion in his voice. "No, you have no\r\nchance," he said, and hesitated while I tried to take in his meaning.\r\n"You see, this is Venus." He waved at the glowing cinder in the sky.\r\n"_That_ was Earth up there."\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
