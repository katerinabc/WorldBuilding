A little\r\nover a light-cycle farther out I noticed during one of my periodic\r\ninspections that the young leaves were beginning to turn yellow, and\r\nsubsequent tests of several greendeck soil samples revealed an acute\r\ndeficiency of mineral elements D-2 and Z-1, plus an advanced aridity.\r\nI immediately retired to the greenship\'s subdeck, where I found the\r\ncontents of the soil-solution vat to be at a shockingly low level. An\r\nanalysis of the contents indicated a near-total absence of mineral\r\nelements D-2 and Z-1.\r\n\r\nFurther investigations have since convinced me that the responsibility\r\nfor this critical shortage rests upon the shoulders of none other\r\nthan Ur-Lon-Ho-Lee, Interstellar Nurseries\' senior shipping clerk, but\r\nat the time, the yumquat-tree shipment pre-empted my attention to the\r\nexclusion of all other matters. If the trees were to be allowed to\r\nshoot up at the usual accelerated growth rate and were to be delivered\r\nin satisfactory sapling stage to the Urtz 2 customer who had ordered\r\nthem, I had but one course of action open to me: to put in to the\r\nnearest system, find a planet with a soil rich in moisture and rich in\r\nmineral elements D-2 and Z-1, and replenish the soil-solution vat by\r\nmeans of the _Uxurient\'s_ ship-to-ground capillary tube. Fortunately,\r\nthere happened to be a system in the vicinity of the _Uxurient\'s_\r\npresent position, but unfortunately it happened to be one of the many\r\nsystems that are out-of-bounds to Interstellar Economic Community\r\nships. Before coming to a decision, then, I had to weigh the importance\r\nof my mission against the risk of causing "a substantial interference\r\nin the normal evolution of an extra-Community culture"--a possibility\r\nthat is always present when a Community ship is forced to enter an\r\nout-of-bounds system. I decided that it was my responsibility both to\r\nthe customer and to the company to run this risk, and proceeded to put\r\nin to the system at once.\r\n\r\nI wasted no time on the outer worlds, knowing from experience that\r\nsuch worlds rarely yield anything in the way of flora and hence could\r\nnot possibly possess the kind of soil I needed, but arrowed in to the\r\norbital regions of the first four. Perceiving at once that Four would\r\nnot serve my purpose, I continued on to Three. Three turned out to\r\nbe a Frimm 4-type planet in all respects save its slightly smaller\r\nsize; it also turned out to be the reason for the system\'s having been\r\nplaced out-of-bounds. I was not surprised: One seldom finds soil of\r\nthe type employed by Frimm 4 nurseries without finding intelligent\r\nlife in the immediate vicinity. In this instance, I used the term\r\n"intelligent life" in its broadest sense, for the several civilizations\r\nI transchecked at random revealed technologies not far removed from the\r\npaleolithic stage, and in one case, in the very midst of it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn several of the land masses I detected scattered deposits of the\r\nsoil-type I needed, and I could have replenished the _Uxurient\'s_\r\nsoil-solution vat from any of them. However, I chose an unusually\r\nrich one on a large island near the major land mass, reasoning that\r\nthe less time I consumed in the operation, the less chance there\r\nwould be of my occasioning "a substantial interference in the normal\r\nevolution of an extra-Community culture". This particular deposit\r\nbordered a small community of scattered, thatch-roofed dwellings, and\r\nabounded in trees similar to the yumquat species. After activating the\r\n_Uxurient\'s_ ventral camouflage-unit, I brought the greenship down to\r\nabout two hundred mirids, gravved it into position above the edge of\r\nthe forest, and opened the capillary-tube lock. I timed my maneuver to\r\ncoincide with the passing of the dusk belt, but, reluctant to attract\r\nany more attention than was absolutely necessary, I waited through\r\nmost of the ensuing night phase before lowering the capillary tube.\r\nUnfortunately, I erred somewhat in my calculations, and the tube\'s\r\nrhizomorphous feeding system, owing partially to the rather strong\r\nwind that had sprung up during the night phase, entered the soil much\r\ncloser to one of the native dwellings than I had intended should be the\r\ncase; however, dawn being near at hand, I lacked sufficient time to\r\nrecoil and relocate the device, so I left it where it was. I was not\r\nparticularly worried: the natives\' superstitious fear of the tube would\r\nprobably preclude their approaching it closely enough for them to be\r\nable to damage it, and if their superstitious fear of the tube itself\r\nwas not strong enough to make them keep their distance, their fear of\r\nthe "low-lying cloud" from which the tube depended should be.\r\n\r\nMy mind at ease in this respect then, I reduced the opacity of the\r\nhull\'s upper hemisphere to complete transparency so that the greendeck\r\nwould benefit from the rays of the system\'s sun, after which I retired\r\nto the subdeck to check on the first influx of nutrients into the\r\nsoil-solution vat. The length of the capillary tube prohibited any\r\nimmediate change in the solution-level, so while I waited, I busied\r\nmyself checking the tubes that run down to the vat from the section of\r\nthe greendeck where the upper extremities of the capillary tube are\r\naffixed. Next, I checked the outgoing tubes that feed the greendeck\r\nsoil. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
By the time I finished, the level had begun to rise.\r\n\r\nI waited till it rose above the halfway mark, then I took a sample\r\nand ran an analysis. The result delighted me: the D-2 and Z-1 mineral\r\nelement content had quadrupled! If the rapidity with which the vat was\r\nfilling continued, I would be able to disengage the capillary tube,\r\nrecoil it, and be on my way before the next night phase.\r\n\r\nI lingered for a while longer, watching the level climb. Finally,\r\nremembering that I had not eaten since before my discovery of the soil\r\ndeficiency, I left the vat-room, picked up three lliaka hind quarters\r\nin the meat-compartment, attached them to my belt, and proceeded up\r\nthe ramp to the greendeck. The thought of the fine steaks which the\r\nquarters would yield made me realize how truly hungry I was, and I\r\nset off across the greendeck toward my distant living quarters with\r\nquickened steps. As I walked, the sight of the arid soil stretching\r\naway in every direction afflicted me with melancholy, even though I\r\nknew that the deplorable condition was well on its way toward being\r\ncorrected. The leaves of the baby yumquat trees, I saw to my dismay,\r\nhad more than merely yellowed: they had shriveled too. And so scrawny\r\nwere the little shoots that, had I not known that they were there, I\r\nmight very well have walked in their midst and have been unaware of\r\ntheir existence. Indeed, the greendeck, awash now with bright morning\r\nsunlight, had more of the aspect of a desert than it did an aspect of\r\na thriving oasis where plants are grown during shipment. I submit that\r\nmy bringing the _Uxurient_ in to an out-of-bounds system was more than\r\nmerely justified: it was in keeping with the highest ideals that govern\r\nman in his relationship to plant-life.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  (2)\r\n\r\n    _How a Boarding Party of One gained the Greendeck and made off with\r\n    a Uterium 5 Snirk Bird, a Toy Friddlefork, and Two Containers of\r\n    Yellow Trading Disks._\r\n\r\n\r\nArriving at my living quarters, I removed my greendeck fatigues and\r\nlaid them upon the arms of the rack beside the entrance, wondering as\r\nI always do on such occasions how Ho-Hat-Li-Tum, the company\'s morale\r\nmanager, could have fallen for so blatantly whimsical an appointment\r\nas a clothes rack in the form of a life-size woman. Granted, greenship\r\npilots lead lonely lives, but tell me this: how can the mere act of\r\ntheir laying their outer garments upon the outstretched arms of a\r\nbrainless, speechless, feelingless mannequin in the least alleviate\r\ntheir loneliness? If Ho-Hat-Li-Tum were really concerned about the\r\nmorale of the greenship pilots, he would spurn such halfway measures\r\nand concentrate his energies on getting the regulation that forbids\r\npilots to take their wives into space with them rescinded.\r\n\r\nTo continue: Once in my living quarters, I proceeded directly to\r\nthe galley where I cut two large steaks from one of the lliaka\r\nhindquarters. Placing the steaks upon the grill to sear, I got a loaf\r\nof bread and decanter of wine out of the provision closet, after which\r\nI set the table. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
When the steaks were done, I placed them on a large\r\nplatter and sat down to eat. It was at this point that I received a\r\nvery definite impression that I was being watched.\r\n\r\nI looked around the galley. Other than myself, of course, no one was\r\nthere, and certainly the various cupboards were much too small to\r\nharbor a secret onlooker. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
A secret onlooker indeed! Angry with myself,\r\nI put the matter from my mind, concluding that the condition of the\r\nyumquat trees had depressed me to a greater extent than I had realized,\r\nand that I had fallen prey to preposterous imaginings. I wish now that\r\nI had been less eager to ascribe what proved to be a perfectly valid\r\npsychosensory perception to my emotional letdown.\r\n\r\nI ate ravenously, devouring both of the steaks and the entire loaf of\r\nbread. Afterward, a feeling of peace and good will stole over me, and\r\non an impulse I called the Uterium 5 snirk bird down from its perch\r\nabove the galley doorway and persuaded it by means of a crust of bread\r\nto perch upon my forefinger. Despite the large and ovoid xanthous\r\ndroppings which these birds sporadically deposit on chairs, tables\r\nand floors, they make wonderful pets, and I envied the particular\r\ncustomer who was to receive this one--a tiny, bright-eyed female--as\r\na partial bonus for his yumquat-tree order. The other components\r\nof his bonus--the toy friddlefork and the two containers of yellow\r\ntrading disks--stood on a shelf just behind me, and reaching around\r\nand procuring them, I set them on the table before me. Such evidence\r\nof largess invariably renews my faith in the company, and on long runs\r\nI often get out customer bonuses and speculate on the munificence of a\r\nconcern such as ours. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Thus I speculated now--but not for long. I had\r\nnot slept for nearly two zodal periods and was far more tired than I\r\nrealized, and to complicate matters, the heavy meal which I had just\r\nconsumed had had a soporific effect upon me. Almost before I knew it, I\r\ndozed off.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI believe that my first apprisal that the previously mentioned\r\npsychosensory perception had not been illusory after all was the creak\r\nof one of the cupboard doors. Unfortunately, this apprisal was on the\r\nunconscious, rather than the conscious, level, and failed to arouse me\r\nfrom my stupor. It took the hysterical cackling of the Uterium 5 snirk\r\nbird, a few moments later, to bring me back to true awareness, and by\r\nthat time, it was too late. The tiny man who had shinned up the table\r\nleg and seized the snirk bird, the two containers of yellow trading\r\ndisks, and the toy friddlefork had already regained the deck and was\r\nrunning toward the doorway. In the process of climbing back down, he\r\nmust have bumped the toy friddlefork and accidentally activated its\r\ntonal unit, for it was bleating away insistently as he bore it away.\r\nIndeed, so insistent were its cries that one would have thought that it\r\nexpected me to come after it and succor it.\r\n\r\nIncredulously, I got to my feet. I saw then that the thief was not\r\na man, but a boy--the tiniest boy that I have ever seen in my whole\r\nlife. Assuming his stature to be average, it is unlikely that even a\r\nfull-grown adult of his species would come any higher than a Frimm 4\'s\r\ncitizen\'s knee-cap!\r\n\r\nI called after him, uttering my name in as gentle a tone of voice as\r\nI could manage and assuring him that if he would return the articles\r\nhe had stolen no harm would come to him. He only ran the faster, and\r\nfairly streaked through the galley doorway, down the entrance corridor,\r\nand out onto the greendeck. I had no choice but to set off in pursuit,\r\nand this I did, naively believing that I could overtake him easily. In\r\nthis I erred indeed. Never have I ever seen anyone run so fast. Why,\r\nthere were times when I could have sworn that his feet weren\'t even\r\ntouching the deck!\r\n\r\nAs I lumbered along in his wake, I wondered how he could conceivably\r\nhave gotten on board. Had he climbed the capillary tube? This didn\'t\r\nseem possible in view of the _Uxurient\'s_ altitude and in view of his\r\ndiminutiveness, but I could think of no other answer. There was no\r\nneed for me to, I saw presently: that he had climbed up the tube was\r\nunequivocably demonstrated by the ease and the celerity with which he\r\nnow began to climb down it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  (3)\r\n\r\n    _Why the_ Uxurient\'s _Flexible Ship-to-Ground Capillary Tube is now\r\n    Ten Exids Shorter than It used to be_\r\n\r\n\r\nLoath to give up the chase, I started climbing down the tube myself.\r\nThis is not as difficult as one would at first imagine--as I myself\r\nhad imagined, in fact, prior to making the attempt. The branch-like\r\nprotuberances that absorb the sunlight and transmute it into the\r\nenergy required for the capillary-action provide numerous hand- and\r\nfootholds, and had it not been for the almost gale-force wind that had\r\ndeveloped, my descent would have been relatively easy. Even with the\r\nwind, I found myself in no great danger, and I have no doubt but what\r\nI would have reached the ground in due course had I not underestimated\r\nthe resourcefulness--and the blood-thirstiness--of my youthful quarry.\r\nHe kept calling out repeatedly at the top of his voice, but I did\r\nnot suspect what he was up to until, halfway down, I paused and\r\nlooked below me. I was just in time to see a woman run out of the\r\nthatch-roofed dwelling near which the tube had rooted itself and hand\r\nhim a small object the very moment his feet touched the ground.\r\n\r\nI deduced from the shards of sunlight that the object threw off that\r\nit was a cutting tool of some kind. I was not long left in doubt in\r\nany event, for no sooner did the boy have it in his possession than\r\nhe began to wield it. A series of thuds was borne upward by the wind,\r\nand with each thud, the tube gave a convulsive shudder. I had seen\r\nunattached ship-to-ground capillary tubes at the mercy of the wind\r\nbefore, and I knew the danger that confronted me. Consequently I\r\nbegan climbing back up toward the _Uxurient_ at once. While I will\r\nnot attempt to deny that I was frightened, I would like to point out\r\nthat it wasn\'t so much my predicament that frightened me, but the\r\ncold-blooded attitude of the young savage below me. He thought that\r\nby severing the tube he could bring it crashing to the ground, and the\r\nferocity and the frequency of his blows testified to the eagerness with\r\nwhich he awaited my destruction.\r\n\r\nIt was his very attitude, I believe, that gave me the strength and the\r\ndetermination to gain the _Uxurient_ after the tube broke free and\r\nbegan lashing wildly back and forth. For a long while I lay gasping on\r\nthe greendeck; then, when my breath came back, I recoiled the tube,\r\nsecured the tube-lock, and lifted into space. The soil-solution vat\r\nwas not as full as I would have wished, but by careful rationing I\r\nknew that I could make its contents suffice. Whether I could or not, I\r\nwanted no more part of the world I had just left. I never want to see\r\nthe place again.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI would like to append a word in my defense. While it is true that I\r\nwas instrumental in exposing an extra-Community culture to a technology\r\nfar beyond its ken, it must be remembered that all such cultures are\r\nflexible in nature and can absorb the seemingly inexplicable with the\r\nutmost equanimity. They achieve this quite simply by identifying the\r\nunfamiliar with the familiar, and by ascribing those phenomena which\r\nhappen to be beyond their experience to the workings of magic. Far\r\nfrom having an adverse effect, the present instance will, I am sure,\r\nprovide the basis for a colorful legend. No doubt the legend will\r\nacquire a more satisfying ending, and unquestionably the boy\'s exploits\r\nwill be exaggerated. As regards the Uterium 5 snirk bird, the toy\r\nfriddlefork, and the two containers of yellow trading disks, you may\r\nbe sure that the young rascal had already identified them with objects\r\nwith which he was familiar (and which he coveted) before he left the\r\ngalley cupboard in which he was hiding. If he had not done so, he would\r\nnot have stolen them. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
In any case, I am not unduly bitter about their\r\nloss, even though I must make that loss good. The measure of a Frimm 4\r\ncitizen\'s true worth is the quantity of his magnanimity; hence I hope\r\nthat both the boy and the woman--probably his mother--live happily ever\r\nafter.\r\n\r\n                                                               (signed)\r\n                                                          Fee-Fi-Fo-Fum\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
