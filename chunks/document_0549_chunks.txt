=== Chunk 2 ===
We have no sympathy for them--and neither\r\n    has Mr. Smith. Still, we\'re rather glad he decided to make human\r\n    heroism the cornerstone of a most exciting tale of conflict in\r\n    space._\r\n\r\n\r\n     no\r\n hiding\r\n  place\r\n\r\n _by ... Richard R. Smith_\r\n\r\n\r\n The Earth was enveloped in atomic fire and the ship was\r\n a prize of war. But disaster may make victory mandatory.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ship leaped toward the stars, its engines roaring with a desperate\r\nburst of energy and its bulkheads audibly protesting the tremendous\r\npressures.\r\n\r\nIn the control room, Emmett Corbin listened to the screech of tormented\r\nmetal and shuddered. The heat was suffocating, and acrid fumes assailed\r\nhis nostrils and burned his eyes until he almost cried out in pain.\r\n\r\nDespite the agony, his gaze did not waver from the video set across the\r\nroom. In the screen, Earth was a rapidly diminishing orb, charred and\r\nmottled with glowing atomic fires.\r\n\r\n_Everything_, a far corner of his mind whispered. _Everything on Earth\r\nis dead!_\r\n\r\nHe was a carpenter and luckily, he had been working inside the\r\nbarricades of an Army spaceport when the news came that the enemy had\r\nbroken through the defense ring beyond Pluto. He had continued nailing\r\nthe cedar siding on the building, knowing that if he stopped his work\r\nand waited, he would start screaming.\r\n\r\nAn MP running by the building several minutes later had shouted at him,\r\nurging him to board one of the ships on the landing field. In those last\r\nhours, they had loaded the few remaining spaceships as quickly as\r\npossible, ignoring the importance of the passengers. He reflected that\r\nmany millionaires and influential politicians were now dead simply\r\nbecause they hadn\'t been close enough to the spaceports when the\r\nunexpected news came. Watching the pilots as they sat tense before the\r\ncontrols, he felt overcome with helplessness.\r\n\r\nThe passenger on his right was a girl--red-haired and undeniably\r\nattractive. He remembered her name. It was Gloria White, and she was the\r\ndaughter of Colonel White who had led the expedition to Venus. Her\r\nfather had died months before but his friends had used their influence\r\nto establish her as a secretary on the spaceport where it was assumed\r\nshe would be comparatively safe.\r\n\r\nHe had seen her frequently but almost always at a distance. She had been\r\nfriendly enough, but she had never exchanged more than a few casual\r\nwords with him. He had often paused in his work to admire her. But now,\r\naboard one of the last ships to leave Earth, he evaluated her only as\r\nanother passenger.\r\n\r\nThe man on his left was dressed expensively. His general appearance\r\nradiated prestige although his fleshy face was filled with disbelief as\r\nif he were witnessing a fantastic nightmare.\r\n\r\n_Rinnnng! Rinnnng!_ Corbin\'s thoughts were interrupted by a clamoring\r\nalarm bell declaring by its volume and insistence that the danger was\r\nstill acute. _That bell will ring until the ship is destroyed_, he\r\nthought wildly. _It could very well mean that the ship will be\r\ndestroyed!_\r\n\r\nThe pilots leaped away from the controls as if they had abruptly become\r\nwhite hot. "_Rocket_," one of them screamed. "Enemy rocket on our tail!"\r\n\r\nCorbin turned suddenly and ran across the room in sudden, blind panic.\r\n"We can\'t shake it! Nobody can shake one!" Mumbling incoherently, he\r\ngrabbed a spacesuit and began to don it.\r\n\r\nThe room was suddenly a seething mass of confusion. The pilots\r\ndistributed spacesuits and helped passengers into them while the cabin\r\ncontinued to sway and lurch. Fear-crazed passengers ran aimlessly in\r\ncircles. Some fainted and others were shocked into immobility.\r\n\r\nEmmett had barely finished securing his helmet when the ship shook\r\nviolently and he was knocked to the floor. The lights fluttered, then\r\nwent out.\r\n\r\nWhen the trembling at last subsided, he struggled to his feet and looked\r\nabout the room. His eyes gradually adjusted to the faint light from the\r\nluminous paint on the walls and he was able to make out two shadowy\r\nfigures moving hesitantly about the wreckage.\r\n\r\nHe remained motionless as one of the two men approached him, reached out\r\nand adjusted the dials on his spacesuit controls. The earphones in his\r\nhelmet blared with a familiar voice, "Are you all right?"\r\n\r\n"Y-Yeah. Just a little shaken."\r\n\r\nThe man walked toward the third passenger and presently Emmett heard a\r\nquick, sobbing breath through the earphones.\r\n\r\n"Are you hurt?" the man asked.\r\n\r\n"No." Even under the abnormal conditions Gloria White\'s calm voice came\r\nthrough clearly.\r\n\r\nThey wandered aimlessly about the room, each engrossed in his private\r\nmental turmoil. Finally the pilot broke the silence, "Since we\'re\r\nprobably the last ones alive on the ship, we should know each other. My\r\nname is George Hartman.

=== Chunk 4 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Gloria ... Gloria White."\r\n\r\nThe pilot said with grim urgency: "We\'ve got to do something. There\'s no\r\nsense in just standing here--waiting for the enemy to come."\r\n\r\n"Come?" Emmett inquired. "You mean that the Agronians will actually\r\nboard our ship?"\r\n\r\n"They always examine disabled ships. They are determined to learn as\r\nmuch as they can about us."\r\n\r\n"Well, let\'s get some weapons and be ready. I\'m no hero, understand. But\r\nI agree with you that there\'s no sense in just waiting."\r\n\r\nThe pilot said: "There are no hand weapons on the ship. Our only\r\npossible course of action would be to _hide_." 

=== Chunk 5 ===
His emphasis conveyed to\r\nthe others how much he disliked the thought.\r\n\r\n"But where?" Gloria asked. "If they make a thorough search--"\r\n\r\n"We can\'t hide _in_ the ship," George said, with absolute conviction.\r\n"Our reports indicate that they examine every square foot inside a\r\nbombed vessel. We\'ll have to conceal ourselves outside."\r\n\r\n"_Outside?_"\r\n\r\n"We can use the magnetic shoes on our spacesuits to walk on the ship\'s\r\nhull. If luck favors us they may never even think of searching the\r\nforward section of the hull."\r\n\r\nEmmett shrugged his shoulders, not realizing that in the faint light no\r\none could see the gesture. Gloria said, "It\'s better than making no\r\nattempt at all to save ourselves."\r\n\r\nGeorge led the way from the control room, and across a passenger\r\ncompartment that was filled with the crumpled, lifeless forms of almost\r\na hundred men and women.\r\n\r\n"There were no spacesuits in this room," he explained simply.\r\n\r\nThey operated the air lock by utilizing the emergency manual controls,\r\nand were soon standing on the hull of the ship. For several seconds they\r\nremained motionless and silent, grimly surveying their awesome\r\nsurroundings. The billions of stars above were terrifyingly vivid\r\nagainst the dark emptiness of space. The ship\'s hull was fantastically\r\ntwisted and pitted, and the enemy ship--it hovered a few miles\r\ndistant--had been transformed into a brilliantly burning star by the\r\nreflected sunlight.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve got to find cover," George said quickly. "If they\'re watching the\r\nship with telescopes we\'ll stand out like fireflies in a dark room!"\r\n\r\nCautiously sliding their feet across the hull, Gloria and Emmett\r\nfollowed the pilot. Presently he pointed to a spot where a large section\r\nof the hull had been twisted back upon itself, forming a deep pocket.\r\n"This should be good enough," he said.\r\n\r\nThey followed his example as he knelt and crawled through the small\r\nopening. To Emmett it was like crawling into a sardine can. The space\r\nwas barely large enough to accommodate the three of them, and through\r\nthe spacesuit\'s tough fabric, he could feel faint, shifting pressures\r\nthat indicated he was leaning against someone\'s back and sitting on\r\nsomeone\'s legs. They shuffled about in the total darkness until they\r\nreached a fairly comfortable position and then crouched in silence until\r\nlight flashed all about them.\r\n\r\n"Look!" Gloria whispered. Emmett stared through a narrow gash in the\r\nmetal near his head and saw a group of Agronians approaching the ship.\r\nThe starlight, glittering on their strange spacesuits, transformed them\r\ninto weird apparitions.\r\n\r\nEmmett closed his eyes and breathed a silent prayer. When he opened them\r\nagain he could see only the unwinking stars and the enemy ship, which\r\nwas still hovering nearby like a huge glaring eye.\r\n\r\n"They\'re inside the ship analyzing our navigational instruments," George\r\nsaid as if he could somehow see through the solid metal. "They\'re a very\r\nthorough race. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
They probably know far more about us than we know about\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"What are we going to do?" Gloria asked. "We can\'t just sit here until\r\nbreathing becomes a torment--"\r\n\r\n"What _can_ we do? There\'s no place to go!" Emmett\'s heart had begun a\r\nfurious pounding. His plight reminded him of how, in a recurrent\r\nnightmare, he had often found himself standing frozen before an oncoming\r\ntruck, his legs immobile as he waited for death. He had always awakened\r\nwith his heart beating furiously and his body bathed in a cold sweat,\r\nhis mind filled with a sickening fear.\r\n\r\nAnd now it was as if the nightmare had become a reality. He was waiting\r\nfor death not in the form of a truck, but in the regular _swish_ of air\r\nthat tickled his ears as his oxygen supply was purified and replenished.\r\nEventually the sound would change its timbre as the purifying agents\r\nbecame less efficient. The faint sound was not as impressive as the\r\nsight of a truck. But he knew that in a short time it would be just as\r\ndeadly. And, as in the nightmare, he was powerless ...\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA long silence followed--broken only by the _swish_ of Emmett\'s\r\noxygen-rejuvenating machinery. He listened intently and the _swish_ grew\r\nin volume until it became a roar in his ears--a sound more thunderous\r\nthan that of a thousand trucks.\r\n\r\n"There is a place where we\'d be completely safe," Gloria exclaimed, her\r\nvoice suddenly loud in his ears. "I don\'t know how we could get there.\r\nBut if a way could be found--"\r\n\r\n"Venus?" George inquired. "The colony your father started?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. There are only a few colonists there--not more than twenty-five.\r\nThe war with the Agronians started just after the settlement was\r\nestablished and the government never had a chance to send out more\r\ncolonists. Father showed me the approximate location--"\r\n\r\n"The Agronians have probably destroyed the base by now," Emmett said.\r\nBut his senses were tingling with new hope.\r\n\r\nGloria shook her head. "I don\'t think so. The enemy has studied the\r\nremains of our warships but there\'s a good chance that the information\r\nnever fell into their hands."\r\n\r\n"How do we get there? We haven\'t got a ship, and _we can\'t walk_!"\r\n\r\n"We haven\'t got a ship," George agreed. "But we can try to get one."\r\n\r\nEmmett felt suddenly cold when he realized what the pilot had in mind.\r\n"The enemy ship?" he asked.\r\n\r\nGeorge nodded. "During the skirmish at Arcturus, we managed to capture\r\none of their ships and I was a member of a group that studied it. I\'m\r\nsure I can fly one of their vessels, for the controls are far simpler\r\nthan ours. Most of the Agronians have left their ship to study ours, and\r\nthat leaves only a skeleton crew on board. We can use our spacesuit jets\r\nto cross the distance. As you can see, it isn\'t too far."\r\n\r\n"And precisely what happens when we reach their ship?"\r\n\r\n"Who knows? Maybe we\'ll get killed. But getting killed in a struggle for\r\nsurvival is better than just waiting to die."\r\n\r\nGloria shuddered. "It looks so cold out there. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
We\'ll get\r\nseparated--hopelessly lost. I don\'t even know how to operate the\r\nspacesuit\'s rockets!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t either," Emmett admitted.\r\n\r\n"It\'s simple." George carefully explained the operation of the rockets\r\nin detail and ended by instructing them, "We\'ll get separated on the\r\nway. But when we reach the ship, we\'ll try to meet at the air lock. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
It\r\nresembles the air lock of an Earth ship."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFloating through space toward the enemy ship, Emmett felt overcome with\r\nan absurd sensation of freedom. Completely surrounded by billions of\r\nmotionless, pin-point stars and securely hidden by the vast blackness of\r\nspace, the aliens and the problem of survival seemed dream-like and\r\nunreal.\r\n\r\nA sharp pain stabbed at his left arm and he heard a brief hissing sound.\r\nOxygen was escaping from his spacesuit. The sound abruptly stopped when\r\nthe suit automatically sealed the puncture. And yet the throbbing pain\r\nremained and he felt the wetness of blood against his flesh, seeping\r\nslowly down his leg.\r\n\r\n_A meteor!_ People usually visualized meteors as tons of metal hurtling\r\nthrough space. But there were small ones as well, and perhaps this one\r\nhad been no larger than a grain of sand. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
He dismissed it from his mind,\r\nand after what seemed an eternity, his feet touched the hull of the\r\nenemy ship. Quickly he activated the magnetic boots.\r\n\r\nA distant figure gestured as George\'s voice came loudly over the\r\nintercom system, "This way. Here\'s the air lock!"\r\n\r\n_You should whisper_, he thought. _It would be more fitting._\r\n\r\nHe shuffled in the indicated direction. His legs were rubbery beneath\r\nhim and there was a growing tingling sensation in his left arm. It was\r\njust barely possible that he was bleeding to death. And encased as he\r\nwas in the spacesuit, it would be impossible for him to treat the wound.\r\n\r\n_If_ they reached the colony on Venus he would receive medical\r\nattention, of course. But they must first overpower the ship\'s crew, and\r\nit would take approximately two hours to reach the colony. Could he hold\r\nout that long?\r\n\r\nHe didn\'t know.\r\n\r\nGeorge knelt and carefully examined the rectangular outline in the metal\r\nbeneath their feet. "It\'s only a sort of button," he said. "It could be\r\na device that opens the lock by means of a code sequence--or it could be\r\na signal to notify those inside to open the lock."\r\n\r\n"What should we do?" Gloria asked nervously.\r\n\r\nInstead of replying, George pushed the button firmly. The section of\r\nhull beneath them instantly dropped several feet. Emmett looked up in\r\ntime to see an outer air-lock panel swiftly blot out the stars.\r\n\r\nBrief seconds later, the compartment was filled with a brilliant light\r\nand tiny nozzles in the ceiling sprayed a bluish gas about them.\r\n\r\nGloria leapt quickly to one side. "What\'s that?" she asked, in alarm.\r\n\r\n"It\'s the Agronian atmosphere," George said. "Although their locks are\r\nmechanically different, the principle behind them is the same as ours."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a strange-looking atmosphere," Emmett remarked. The pain in his\r\narm and the numbness that was gradually spreading throughout his body\r\nhad relaxed his mind. He felt so physically detached from his\r\nsurroundings that he could look at the fog-like gas that swirled about\r\nthem with interest rather than concern.\r\n\r\n"It\'s poisonous," George said. "We managed to analyze some. One breath\r\nis enough to kill a human--"\r\n\r\nAn inner door abruptly glided to one side and George leaped into the\r\nroom beyond. Emmett followed as quickly as possible, although he felt\r\nsleepy and his every action seemed a study in slow motion.\r\n\r\nExcept for the level expanse of the floor, the room before them was\r\nentirely alien. The thick atmosphere swirled eerily. The control board\r\nwas recognizable as such, but being adapted for tentacles instead of\r\nhuman hands, it appeared to be a meaningless maze of equipment. Strange,\r\nangular devices lined the walls and hung from the low ceiling on thin\r\nwires. As Emmett scanned the odd artifacts, he could understand only\r\none--a group of web-like hammocks that were obviously used by the aliens\r\nto sleep in.\r\n\r\nTwo Agronians stood before the large control board at the far side of\r\nthe room. It was the first time Emmett had seen the enemy other than in\r\npictures and the sight of the thousands of snakelike, wriggling antennae\r\nnauseated him.\r\n\r\nGeorge hesitated briefly and then ran toward the Agronians. Again Emmett\r\nfollowed the pilot\'s lead. One of the creatures aimed a weapon before\r\nGeorge had crossed half the distance and Gloria\'s shrill scream of\r\nwarning brought him up short. But before the weapon could be discharged,\r\nthe other Agronian viciously flung a tentacle and sent it spinning from\r\nhis companion\'s clasp.\r\n\r\nGeorge leaped at the nearest Agronian but the creature easily eluded\r\nhim. He made another attempt and failed again.\r\n\r\nThe man and the alien cautiously surveyed each other.\r\n\r\n"They\'re too fast for us," George admitted. His voice was filled with\r\nthe bitterness of defeat and his shoulders sagged visibly.\r\n\r\n"_Do something!_" Gloria screamed. "Do something before the others come\r\nback!"\r\n\r\nEmmett glanced apprehensively at the air lock. She was right. At the\r\nmoment they outnumbered the enemy, but when the others returned the\r\nAgronians could overpower them by sheer weight of number. And they could\r\nreturn without warning, at any instant.\r\n\r\n"Why did one prevent the other from killing us?" George asked.\r\n\r\n"He may have been afraid the other would miss and damage the ship,"\r\nEmmett said. "Or possibly--"\r\n\r\n"No. They\'re trained from birth to be soldiers. They\'re expert marksmen\r\nand their weapons are foolproof. They can adjust the blast from a weapon\r\nto travel any distance."\r\n\r\n"Why should one enemy prevent another from killing us?" 

=== Chunk 10 ===
Emmett repeated\r\nwonderingly. He remembered another question that had nagged at his mind:\r\n_Why had the Agronians totally destroyed Earth?_ Why hadn\'t they\r\neliminated Earthmen and preserved the planet for exploitation--as a\r\ncolony, a military base, any one of a thousand uses?\r\n\r\nThere was only one possible answer. A race might destroy a planet if it\r\nwas useless. Earthmen had discovered useless planets, planets with\r\npoisonous atmospheres. Was Earth\'s atmosphere poisonous to the\r\nAgronians?\r\n\r\nOne Agronian had prevented another from killing them with a viciousness\r\nand an urgency that indicated it had been a life-and-death necessity.\r\n\r\nWhy? What would happen if they were to die?\r\n\r\nSomething clicked in his mind and a startling certainty occurred to him.\r\n_Oxygen was poisonous to the Agronians!_\r\n\r\nThat was why his life had been spared. And the pilot\'s--and Gloria\'s.\r\nTheir spacesuits would have been punctured and their oxygen supply would\r\nhave spread with deadly rapidity throughout the room.\r\n\r\nWithout hesitation he removed his helmet and adjusted the controls of\r\nhis oxygenating machine until it was discharging oxygen at maximum\r\ncapacity.\r\n\r\nWith a shrill outcry the two aliens darted toward him. But a thin,\r\nghostly vapor of oxygen spread rapidly through the fog-like atmosphere,\r\nand halted them in their tracks.\r\n\r\n"You deserve to die," Emmett whispered.\r\n\r\nThe enemy collapsed at his feet and writhed helplessly on the floor.\r\nTheir bodies quivered spasmodically and were still.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGloria\'s hysterical, joyous laughter rang in his ears like triumphant\r\nbells, and through the Agronian atmosphere that burned his face and\r\nsmarted his eyes he dimly saw George\'s image as he rushed to the control\r\nboard. He held his breath but realized that his death was certain. He\r\ncould never hold his breath long enough to replace the helmet and wait\r\nfor the purifying agents to cleanse the poison that now filled his\r\nspacesuit.\r\n\r\nWhen he could hold his breath no longer, he inhaled quickly and deeply.\r\n\r\nIt was like inhaling a warm, comforting darkness....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ November 1956.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.
