As an invader had he walked into a trap?\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Imagination Stories of Science and Fantasy\r\n                             November 1954\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Young came bounding into the office of _Atomic Science Stories_,\r\nwaving a copy of the first issue in his hand. He stopped at the desk of\r\nthe editor, Art Holderness.\r\n\r\n"Holderness," he roared, his chins quivering, "you\'re fired!"\r\n\r\nHolderness looked up in surprise. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
"Why?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Look at this contents page!"\r\n\r\nHolderness looked at it. "What\'s the matter with it?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you see anything wrong?"\r\n\r\n"No. What shouldn\'t be there?"\r\n\r\n"There isn\'t anything shouldn\'t be there, you idiot. There\'s something\r\nmissing!"\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"Our announcement that the characters and situations in these stories\r\nbear no resemblance to actual persons living or dead."\r\n\r\n"Oh."\r\n\r\n"Is that all you have to say? Think of the libel suits! We\'ll be\r\nruined. I don\'t know why I let myself be talked into adding a science\r\nfiction book anyway. Holderness, you\'re fired.

=== Chunk 3 ===
"\r\n\r\n"But Mr. Young--"\r\n\r\n"You have no idea the trouble we can get into leaving that announcement\r\noff. Get out of this office!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nK-17 removed a copy of _Atomic Science Stories_ from the newsstand and\r\nwent up to his hotel room. He sat down to read it.\r\n\r\nHe had been attracted by the picture of the space ship on the cover,\r\nbecause it reminded him very much of the one in which he had come\r\nto Earth from Rigel IV. And then, when he looked closer at it, he\r\ndiscovered that the four-tentacled purple creatures in the ship looked\r\nnot a little like his fellow Rigelians.\r\n\r\nThis made him homesick, and so, in direct defiance of the orders he had\r\nreceived from his superiors, he pulled down the shades and turned off\r\nthe gadget that set up the hypnotic field around him. Once more he was\r\nfour-tentacled and purple, instead of two-armed and pink, and it felt\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nHe began to read through the stories. The first of them concerned an\r\ninvader from another planet who was on Earth disguised as a man.\r\n\r\nGood Vog! K-17 thought to himself. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
They\'re on to us.\r\n\r\nHe looked over the story again. They had some of the details wrong,\r\nof course, such as saying that the Rigelians--whom they called the\r\nCapellans, for some strange reason--had mouths like octopi, whereas\r\nactually they had no mouths at all. But on the whole it was a\r\ncircumstantial and convincing account of the capture of a Rigelian spy.\r\n\r\nThe story had taken place in Philadelphia. That meant they had M-22.\r\nThis was serious. He picked up his magneto-oscillophone and called the\r\nhome base on the other side of the moon.\r\n\r\n"This is K-17," he reported. "I have just read in a Terran publication\r\ndetails of the capture of M-22."\r\n\r\n"Impossible!" the voice snorted in his auditory nerve. "We have been\r\nreceiving regular reports from M-22."\r\n\r\n"They must have replaced him with a human spy," K-17 mused.\r\n\r\n"Good Vog! Do you really think so?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s the only explanation."\r\n\r\n"Good work, K-17. We\'ll be on our guard."\r\n\r\nK-17 hung up and sat down again to read further. The next story dealt\r\nwith an Earth landing on Mars.\r\n\r\nBut Earthmen _hadn\'t_ landed on Mars.\r\n\r\nOr had they?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis situation was becoming complicated. K-17 thought over all the\r\npossibilities. Was it possible that this magazine contained only\r\nFiction? The title of the thing was _Atomic Science Stories_. He\r\nremembered that he had read a similar magazine called _Impossible\r\nScience Fiction_. Was the distinction between "stories" and "fiction"\r\nsignificant? A fiction was obviously false; but a story could be any\r\nnarrative, true or not. Did this mean--? Good Vog, he wished he knew\r\nmore about Earth culture. But that was what he was here to find out.\r\nThey knew nothing, absolutely nothing, about Earth people. And they\r\ndidn\'t want to try to kill the inhabitants and take over the planet\r\nwithout knowing more about them.\r\n\r\nHe looked closely at the title page of _Atomic Science Stories_. He\r\nrecalled that _Impossible Science Fiction_, which he had, of course,\r\nread every word of, carried an announcement that all the stories were\r\nfiction. He did not see any such announcement on the title page of\r\n_Atomic_. Doubt was wavering into certainty in his mind.\r\n\r\nHe telephoned the offices of the Young Publishing Co., which published\r\nthe magazine. The secretary informed him that the editor, Mr.\r\nHolderness, had been discharged that very morning.\r\n\r\nDischarged, K-17 meditated. Why discharged? Well, he told himself, if\r\nEarth had space travel and was keeping it a secret, and if a magazine\r\nviolated its security precautions and published a story about it, of\r\ncourse they\'d discharge the editor. If it was a fiction magazine, that\r\nwould be different. But a magazine that printed _stories_--some of them\r\ntrue, like the one about the capture of M-22....\r\n\r\nHe called headquarters again, on his magneto-oscillophone. "Earth has\r\nspace travel!" he announced breathlessly.\r\n\r\n"What? 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Don\'t be silly." The voice in his auditory nerve was irritated.\r\n\r\n"A magazine published an account of it, and the editor was discharged\r\nthis morning for security reasons."\r\n\r\n"What? Are you sure?"\r\n\r\n"I just telephoned the office of the magazine and verified everything."\r\n\r\n"Report to the saucer station immediately. You\'re coming back to\r\nheadquarters. We\'ll get out the word to all our other operatives."\r\n\r\n"Except M-22."\r\n\r\n"Yes, of course. We\'ll have to leave him behind. It\'s really too bad.\r\nThe planet offered such nice possibilities."\r\n\r\nThey hung up.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"No, Holderness," Mr. Fribble said, "our magazine can\'t use you either.\r\nWe can\'t have an editor who\'s careless enough to leave off the standard\r\ndisclaimer. Why, there\'s no end of trouble we\'d get into without that\r\nlittle announcement."\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
