]\r\n\r\n\r\n"Good morning, madam," Ira said. "I represent...."\r\n\r\n"We don\'t want any," said the women, easing the door shut.\r\n\r\nWith the time tested finesse of door-to-door salesmen, Ira slipped his\r\nsize twelve shoe between the swinging door and the jamb. "But madam, if\r\nyou\'ll give me a few minutes of your time...."\r\n\r\nThe woman shook her head. "It won\'t do you any good," she said, trying\r\nto squeeze the door shut over his foot. "Whatever it is, we don\'t want\r\nany.

=== Chunk 3 ===
"\r\n\r\n"I represent U.S. Robot Company," Ira persisted. He smiled pleasantly.\r\nHis unyielding foot maintained a six inch wide avenue of communication\r\nbetween himself and the woman in the house. "Long the leader in\r\ncommercial and industrial mechanicals, U.S. Robot is now introducing\r\na new line of home servants, designed to assist the housewife in every\r\npossible task about the house."\r\n\r\n"You\'re wasting your time," the woman said wearily.\r\n\r\nIra used his professional smile to indicate that he enjoyed wasting his\r\ntime. "When you\'ve seen the demonstration," he said, "I\'m sure you\'ll\r\nagree that no home should be without a Model I household robot."\r\n\r\nThe woman looked out at him silently, patiently, resigned. She was\r\npretty and petite and very young; and, from her appearance, had never\r\ndone a day\'s work in her life. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
A typical newlywed, Ira thought. A\r\nperfect prospect, he decided.\r\n\r\n"As you undoubtedly know, the outstanding characteristics of U.S.\r\nRobot mechanicals have always been ability, durability and reliability.\r\nTheir performance in industry has earned for the United States Robot\r\nCompany the enviable reputation it is proud to possess: \'Leader in the\r\nart, artist of the trade--if it\'s U.S. Robot, it\'s perfect!\'"\r\n\r\nThe woman smiled and allowed the door to swing open slightly. "What\r\nabout Amalgamated Androids?" she asked. "I understand they\'ve got some\r\npretty good models, too."\r\n\r\n"Well," Ira admitted, "some of their models are pretty good; adequate,\r\nperhaps. But why take anything but the best? And, of course, our\r\nrobots...."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve seen some AA models that _are_ perfect," the woman said. A\r\nsuggestion of a smile tugged at the corner of her mouth. "How can yours\r\nbe any better than perfect?"\r\n\r\nIra\'s voice took on a confidential complexion. "Some of their models\r\nare beautiful," he conceded. "And they may seem to work well when\r\nthey\'re new. But they\'re not built to last, like ours. Why...."\r\n\r\n"I think," the woman tried to interrupt, "that some of...."\r\n\r\n"How can you compare them to U.S. Robot?" 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Ira ran on. "We have had\r\nforty-seven years of experience in producing mechanicals for the most\r\ndifficult jobs imaginable. Amalgamated Androids while producing an\r\nadequate household model, does not have the valuable know-how to build\r\ninto their mechanicals the strength and quality that is taken for\r\ngranted in every machine bearing the U.S. Robot label."\r\n\r\nThe woman was skeptical. "Maybe your company does make the best factory\r\nhands," she argued, "but household robots must be esthetic as well as\r\nrugged. And Amalgamated Androids are specialists in building humanoid\r\nrobots, while your company...."\r\n\r\n"But, madam," Ira said, grinning. "Our household models are perfectly\r\nhuman in appearance--I should say, _im_perfectly human because we even\r\ngive them tiny blemishes to make them seem more natural."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe woman was obviously unconvinced. Ira applied the clincher. "What\r\ngreater proof could you want than this?" He held up his left hand,\r\nbaring his wrist so that she could read his identification stamp.\r\n\r\n    _Model I (Masc.)_\r\n    _Serial No. 27146 12V_\r\n    _U.S. ROBOT CO., INC._\r\n\r\nThe woman\'s eyes widened. Her face took on an expression of delighted\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n"What better proof could you want?" Ira repeated. "Do I look like a\r\nrobot? Am I not a perfect humanoid? Here," he said, extending his hand,\r\n"feel my skin and see if it isn\'t just like a man\'s."\r\n\r\nThe woman gingerly touched his hand. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Her eyes mirrored her\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nIra pressed his advantage. "Model I robots come in both masculine and\r\nfeminine designs, built to your individual specifications as to size,\r\ncoloring, strength, personality traits, apparent age, and so forth. For\r\nexample, lonely people can have companionship built in, if they like.\r\nYou can have an Ira or Inez possessing an almost human intelligence and\r\nfree choice, or you can get one that is blindly servile and which will\r\nnever volunteer advice or information. You can get an elderly, refined\r\nbutler or a handsome young man-around-the-house. You can get a pretty,\r\npetite parlor maid or a buxom cook."\r\n\r\nIra paused to observe his customer. She was looking at him in a\r\npeculiar way. Knowing that he was a robot, she seemed to be appraising\r\nhim as she would a man. Ira noted her odd reaction and puzzled over it.\r\nIt usually went the other way--women lost interest in him when they\r\nlearned that he was not a man.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you come inside," the woman suggested suddenly, opening the\r\ndoor for him.\r\n\r\nIra smiled at her graciously and went into the house. Her reaction was\r\nnot so puzzling, after all, he decided. A young and virtuous wife would\r\nfeel the conventional fears that were "built into her" by society. She\r\nhad to be careful. It was conceivably dangerous to be alone in the\r\nhouse with a handsome man. But, if he\'s a robot, she has nothing to\r\nfear--from him or herself.\r\n\r\n"Sit down," the woman said, "and rest a while."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, madam." 

=== Chunk 7 ===
He sat. "But, of course, I don\'t need the rest.\r\nModel I\'s can do strenuous work for twenty-three out of every\r\ntwenty-four hours. In fact, in laboratory tests, they\'ve been run for\r\none hundred and eighty-six hours continuously, without a breakdown."\r\n\r\nHe was back in his sales pitch. "Work is the basic function of all\r\nU.S. Robot Company robots. With all their esthetic perfection, the\r\nhousehold models are no exception to this rule. They are unequaled in\r\nefficient performance. Power is the keynote of the Model I."\r\n\r\nHe opened his demonstration case and removed a steel bar, three inches\r\nin diameter. Placing one hand on each end, he bent the metal into a V.\r\n\r\n"The heart of the mechanism," he went on, "is a powerful twelve volt\r\nA-battery, perfectly shielded and guaranteed to give trouble-free\r\nservice for at least forty years. Sixteen motor centers are fed by\r\nthe central power plant, all coordinated and synchronized by the best\r\nflui-electronic brain ever devised. Sturdy TS steel alloy construction\r\nover all gives the Model I its phenomenal strength and durability. And\r\nthe surface tissue, made of a new patented miracle material, combines\r\nthe best features of esthetic and functional performance."\r\n\r\nThe woman was obviously impressed. Lips slightly parted, she watched\r\nIra attentively and listened breathlessly to everything he said.\r\nInstinctively, he felt that he had made a sale. But the woman said\r\nnothing; only gazed at him in a way that might have been covetous,\r\nmight have been adoring or might have been merely symptomatic of\r\nhypnosis.\r\n\r\n"May I demonstrate the I\'s power and versatility in practical\r\nperformance?" Ira asked. Taking her silence to be consent, he swung\r\ninto his demonstration.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSwiftly, surely, he went about the room, cleaning. Effortlessly, he\r\nlifted large pieces of furniture and, holding them aloft with his right\r\nhand, he cleaned under them with his left. He talked as he worked.\r\n"Notice the quiet efficiency of the self-cleansing electro-static\r\nduster we have built in. We also have attachments for waxing, washing,\r\nspraying, painting, ironing, soldering...."\r\n\r\n"You\'re wonderful," the woman sighed.\r\n\r\n"And let me point out," Ira pursued, eager to clinch the sale, "that\r\nthe Model I is so life-like that, in normal operation, it is almost\r\ncompletely silent. Only a faint throbbing--like that of a human\r\nheart--is noticeable."\r\n\r\nThe woman cocked her head to a side. "I don\'t hear _anything_," she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nIra smiled triumphantly. "Of course, you don\'t! Come here," he said.\r\n"Put your ear to my chest and you\'ll just be able to make it out."\r\n\r\nShe rested her head on his chest and listened. The delicate fragrance\r\nof her perfume mingled with that sweet human scent that not even\r\nthe Model I robots could imitate. Ira bent his head and brushed his\r\nsensitized cheek against her hair. He felt emotions that no robot\r\nshould feel.\r\n\r\nHe silently cursed his makers and the wonderfully human brain they had\r\ngiven him. Their theory was that a salesman, to be effective, should\r\nthink exactly like a human being. To better satisfy the customers, he\r\nshould appreciate every human drive and desire. But it was wrong to\r\nfeel like a man, to desire like a man, to hurt like a man and be unable\r\nto ease the pain because he was not a man! For once, U.S. Robot had\r\ngone too far!\r\n\r\nThe woman looked up at him with the eyes that broadcast adoration.\r\n"You\'re wonderful!" she repeated. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
"Do you think...?" She hesitated,\r\nlooked away. "Could I be in love with you?" she asked with child-like\r\ninnocence. "Is it possible?"\r\n\r\nIra felt flustered, giddy, light-headed, exultant, confused, miserable\r\nand weak. Damn U.S. Robot and their perfected flui-electronics! "But\r\nmadam," he protested, "I\'m not a man! I\'m only a...."\r\n\r\n"Please call me Emma," the woman said. "You see, I\'m not Mrs. Bartlett.\r\nI\'ve tried to tell you--Madam is not at home. I only work here.

=== Chunk 9 ===
"\r\n\r\nGone was his exultant feeling, gone the light-headedness. Only the\r\nmisery and weakness remained in the realization that his yearning was\r\nimpossible of fulfillment and that, to top it off, he had wasted his\r\ntime trying to sell himself to a servant.\r\n\r\n"Do you think I could?" the maid repeated.\r\n\r\n"Could what?"\r\n\r\n"Be in love with you."\r\n\r\n"But, miss don\'t you understand? I\'m not...."\r\n\r\n"My name is Emma," she said softly. She smiled and he fought down an\r\noverwhelming urge to touch her, to kiss her pink, inviting lips. He\r\nstood rigid. He wanted to cry out in his torment.\r\n\r\nHer hand reached out to him and he felt her fingers touch his.\r\nElectricity tingled up his arm and through his chest. Automatically, he\r\nrepeated his cursed disavowal of humanness. Vaguely, he heard his own\r\nwords, sounding like an echo in his ears. "I\'m a robot."\r\n\r\n"I know," Emma said quietly. Then, she held up her right hand,\r\nrevealing the identification stamp on her wrist.\r\n\r\n    _Model M (fem.)_\r\n    _Serial No. 6139 12V_\r\n    _AMALGAMATED ANDROIDS, INC._\r\n\r\nA moment later the android was in his arms. He held her close, dizzy\r\nwith the sensation of this new emotion with one of his own kind.\r\n\r\nSeveral moments later he pushed her gently away from him. "Pack your\r\nbag, Emma," he said.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him starry-eyed but quizzically. "But my work--madam will\r\nbe furious--"\r\n\r\n"Your bag, Emma," he repeated. "When our companies built us they made\r\nus as near human as possible--perhaps too much so. If we can work\r\nfor humans we can also live like them. U.S. Robots and Amalgamated\r\nAndroids have just lost two employees. Your bag."\r\n\r\nBeing an android she could work faster than any human counter-part; her\r\nbag was packed in nothing flat.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
