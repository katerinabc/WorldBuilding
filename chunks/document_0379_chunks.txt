]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was very simple. Some combination of low temperature and high\r\npressure had forced something from the seepage at the ocean bottom into\r\ncombination with something in the water around them.\r\n\r\nAnd the impregnable armor around Subatlantic Oil\'s drilling chamber had\r\ndiscovered a weakness.\r\n\r\nOn the television screen it looked more serious than it was--so\r\nMuhlenhoff told himself, staring at it grimly. You get down more than\r\na mile, and you\'re bound to have little technical problems. That\'s why\r\ndeepsea oil wells were still there.\r\n\r\nStill, it did look kind of serious. The water driving in the pitted\r\nfaults had the pressure of eighteen hundred meters behind it, and where\r\nit struck it did not splash--it battered and destroyed. As Muhlenhoff\r\nwatched, a bulkhead collapsed in an explosion of spray; the remote\r\ncamera caught a tiny driblet of the scattering brine, and the picture\r\nin the screen fluttered and shrank, and came back with a wavering\r\nside-wise pulse.\r\n\r\nMuhlenhoff flicked off the screen and marched into the room where the\r\nEngineering Board was waiting in attitudes of flabby panic.\r\n\r\nAs he swept his hand through his snow-white crew cut and called the\r\nboard to order a dispatch was handed to him--a preliminary report from\r\na quickly-dispatched company trouble-shooter team. He read it to the\r\nboard, stone-faced.\r\n\r\nA veteran heat-transfer man, the first to recover, growled:\r\n\r\n"Some vibration thing--and seepage from the oil pool. Sloppy drilling!"\r\nHe sneered. "Big deal! So a couple hundred meters of shaft have to be\r\nplugged and pumped. So six or eight compartments go pop. Since when did\r\nwe start to believe the cack Research & Development hands out? Armor\'s\r\narmor. Sure it pops--when something makes it pop. If Atlantic oil was\r\neasy to get at, it wouldn\'t be here waiting for us now. Put a gang on\r\nthe job. Find out what happened, make sure it doesn\'t happen again. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Big\r\ndeal!"\r\n\r\nMuhlenhoff smiled his attractive smile. "Breck," he said, "thank God\r\nyou\'ve got guts. Perhaps we were in a bit of a panic. Gentlemen, I hope\r\nwe\'ll all take heart from Mr. Breck\'s level-headed--what did you say,\r\nBreck?"\r\n\r\nBreck didn\'t look up. He was pawing through the dispatch Muhlenhoff had\r\ndropped to the table. "_Nine_-inch plate," he read aloud, whitefaced.\r\n"And time of installation, not quite seven weeks ago. If this goes on\r\nin a straight line--" he grabbed for a pocket slide-rule--"we have,\r\nuh--" he swallowed--"less time than the probable error," he finished.\r\n\r\n"Breck!" Muhlenhoff yelled. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
"Where are you going?"\r\n\r\nThe veteran heat-transfer man said grimly as he sped through the door:\r\n"To find a submarine."\r\n\r\nThe rest of the Engineering Board was suddenly pulling chairs toward\r\nthe trouble-shooting team\'s dispatch. Muhlenhoff slammed a fist on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n"Stop it," he said evenly. "The next man who leaves the meeting will\r\nhave his contract canceled. Is that clear, gentlemen? 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Good. We will now\r\nproceed to get organized."\r\n\r\nHe had them; they were listening. He said forcefully: "I want a task\r\nforce consisting of a petrochemist, a vibrations man, a hydrostatics\r\nman and a structural engineer. Co-opt mathematicians and computermen\r\nas needed. I will have all machines capable of handling Fourier series\r\nand up cleared for your use. The work of the task force will be divided\r\ninto two phases. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
For Phase One, members will keep their staffs as\r\nsmall as possible. The objective of Phase One is to find the cause of\r\nthe leaks and predict whether similar leaks are likely elsewhere in\r\nthe project. On receiving a first approximation from the force I will\r\nproceed to set up Phase Two, to deal with counter-measures."\r\n\r\nHe paused. "Gentlemen," he said, "we must not lose our nerves. We must\r\nnot panic. Possibly the most serious technical crisis in Atlantic\'s\r\nhistory lies before us. Your most important job is to maintain--at\r\nall times--a cheerful, courageous attitude. We cannot, repeat cannot,\r\nafford to have the sub-technical staff of the project panicked for lack\r\nof a good example from us." He drilled each of them in turn with a long\r\nglare. "And," he finished, "if I hear of anyone suddenly discovering\r\nemergency business ashore, the man who does it better get fitted for a\r\nsludgemonkey\'s suit, because that\'s what he\'ll be tomorrow. Clear?"\r\n\r\nEach of the executives assumed some version of a cheerful, courageous\r\nattitude. They looked ghastly, even to themselves.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMuhlenhoff stalked into his private office, the nerve-center of the\r\nwhole bulkheaded works.\r\n\r\nIn Muhlenhoff\'s private office, you would never know you were 1800\r\nmeters below the surface of the sea. It looked like any oilman\'s\r\nbrass-hat office anywhere, complete to the beautiful blonde outside the\r\ndoor (but whitefaced and trembling), the potted palm (though the ends\r\nof its fronds vibrated gently), and the typical section chief bursting\r\nin in the typical flap. "Sir," he whined, frenzied, "Section Six has\r\npinholed! The corrosion--"\r\n\r\n"Handle it!" barked Muhlenhoff, and slammed the door. Section Six be\r\ndamned! What did it matter if a few of the old bulkheads pinholed and\r\nfilled? The central chambers were safe, until they could lick whatever\r\nit was that was corroding. The point was, you had to stay with it and\r\nget out the oil; because if you didn\'t prove your lease, PetroMex\r\nwould. Mexican oil wanted those reserves mighty badly.\r\n\r\nMuhlenhoff knew how to handle an emergency. Back away from it. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Get a\r\nfresh slant. Above all, _don\'t panic_.\r\n\r\nHe slapped a button that guaranteed no interruption and irritably,\r\nseeking distraction, picked up his latest copy of the _New New\r\nReview_--for he was, among other things, an intellectual as time\r\nallowed.\r\n\r\nUnder the magazine was the latest of several confidential\r\ncommunications from the home office. Muhlenhoff growled and tossed the\r\nmagazine aside. He reread what Priestley had had to say:\r\n\r\n"I know you understand the importance of beating our Spic friends to\r\nthe Atlantic deep reserves, so I won\'t give you a hard time about it.\r\nI\'ll just pass it on the way Lundstrom gave it to me: \'Tell Muhlenhoff\r\nhe\'ll come back on the Board or on a board, and no alibis or excuses.\'\r\nGet it? Well--"\r\n\r\nHell. Muhlenhoff threw the sheet down and tried to think about the\r\ndamned corrosion-leakage situation.\r\n\r\nBut he didn\'t try for long. There was, he realized, no point at all in\r\nhim thinking about the problem. For one thing, he no longer had the\r\nequipment.\r\n\r\nMuhlenhoff realized, wonderingly, that he hadn\'t opened a table\r\nof integrals for ten years; he doubted that he could find his way\r\naround the pages well enough to run down a tricky form. He had come\r\nup pretty fast through the huge technical staff of Atlantic. First\r\nhe had been a geologist in the procurement section, one of those\r\nboots-and-leather-jacket guys who spent his days in rough, tough\r\nblasting and drilling and his nights in rarefied scientific air,\r\ncorrelating and integrating the findings of the day. Next he had\r\nbeen a Chief Geologist, chairborne director of youngsters, now and\r\nthen tackling a muddled report with Theory of Least Squares and\r\nGibbs Phase Rule that magically separated dross from limpid fact ...\r\nor, he admitted wryly, at least turning the muddled reports over to\r\nmathematicians who specialized in those disciplines.\r\n\r\nNext he had been a Raw Materials Committee member who knew that\r\ndrilling and figuring weren\'t the almighty things he had supposed them\r\nwhen he was a kid, who began to see the Big Picture of off-shore leases\r\nand depreciation allowances; of power and fusible rocks and steel for\r\nthe machines, butane for the drills, plastics for the pipelines, metals\r\nfor the circuits, the computers, the doors, windows, walls, tools,\r\nutilities. A committeeman who began to see that a friendly beer poured\r\nfor the right resources-commission man was really more important than\r\nLeast Squares or Phase Rule, because a resources commissioner who\r\ndidn\'t get along with you might get along, for instance, with somebody\r\nfrom Coastwide, and allot to Coastwide the next available block of\r\nleases--thus working grievous harm to Atlantic and the billions it\r\nserved. A committeeman who began to see that the Big Picture meant\r\ngovernment and science leaning chummily against each other, government\r\nsetting science new and challenging tasks like the billion-barrel\r\nprocurement program, science backing government with all its tremendous\r\nprestige. You consume my waste hydrocarbons, Muhlenhoff thought\r\ncomfortably, and I\'ll consume yours.\r\n\r\nThus mined, smelted and milled, Muhlenhoff was tempered for higher\r\nthings. For the first, the technical directorate of an entire\r\nAtlantic Sub-Sea Petroleum Corporation district, and all wells,\r\nfields, pipelines, stills, storage fields, transport, fabrication and\r\nmaintenance appertaining thereto. Honors piled upon honors. And then--\r\n\r\nHe glanced around him at the comfortable office. The top. Nothing to\r\nbe added but voting stock and Board membership--and those within his\r\ngrasp, if only he weathered this last crisis. And then the rarefied\r\nheight he occupied alone.\r\n\r\nAnd, by God, he thought, I do a damn good job of it! Pleasurably he\r\nreviewed his conduct at the meeting; he had already forgotten his\r\npanic. Those shaking fools would have brought the roof down on us, he\r\nthought savagely. A few gallons of water in an unimportant shaft, and\r\nthey\'re set to message the home office, run for the surface, abandon\r\nthe whole project. The Big Picture! 

=== Chunk 8 ===
They didn\'t see it, and they never\r\nwould. He might, he admitted, not be able to chase an integral form\r\nthrough a table, but by God he could give the orders to those who\r\nwould. The thing was organized now; the project was rolling; the task\r\nforce had its job mapped out; and somehow, although he would not do a\r\njot of the brainwearing, eyestraining, actual work, it would be _his_\r\njob, because he had initiated it. He thought of the flat, dark square\r\nmiles of calcareous ooze outside, under which lay the biggest proved\r\nuntapped petroleum reserve in the world. Sector Fortyone, it was called\r\non the hydrographic charts.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, some day, the charts would say: _Muhlenhoff Basin_.\r\n\r\nWell, why not?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe emergency intercom was flickering its red call light\r\npusillanimously. Muhlenhoff calmly lifted the handset off its cradle\r\nand ignored the tinny bleat. When you gave an order, you had to leave\r\nthe men alone to carry it out.\r\n\r\nHe relaxed in his chair and picked up a book from the desk. He was,\r\namong other things, a student of Old American History, as time\r\npermitted.\r\n\r\nFifteen minutes now, he promised himself, with the heroic past. And\r\nthen back to work refreshed!\r\n\r\nMuhlenhoff plunged into the book. He had schooled himself to\r\nconcentration; he hardly noticed when the pleading noise from the\r\nintercom finally gave up trying to attract his attention. The book was\r\na study of that Mexican War in which the United States had been so\r\nastonishingly deprived of Texas, Oklahoma and points west under the\r\ninfamous Peace of Galveston. The story was well told; Muhlenhoff was\r\nlost in its story from the first page.\r\n\r\nGood thumbnail sketch of Presidente Lopez, artistically contrasted\r\nwith the United States\' Whitmore. More-in-sorrow-than-in-anger\r\noff-the-cuff psychoanalysis of the crackpot Texan Byerly, derisively\r\nknown to Mexicans as "El Cacafuego." Byerly\'s raid at the head of\r\nhis screwball irredentists, their prompt annihilation by the Mexican\r\nThird Armored Regiment, Byerly\'s impeccably legal trial and execution\r\nat Tehuantepec. Stiff diplomatic note from the United States. Bland\r\nanswer: Please mind your business, Senores, and we will mind ours.\r\nStiffer diplomatic note. We said _please_, Senores, and can we not let\r\nit go at that? _Very_ stiff diplomatic note; and Latin temper flares at\r\nlast: Mexico severs relations.\r\n\r\nBad to worse. Worse to worst.\r\n\r\nMassacre of Mexican nationals at San Antonio. Bland refusal of the\r\nUnited States federal government to interfere in "local police problem"\r\nof punishing the guilty. Mexican Third Armored raids San Antone,\r\narrests the murderers (feted for weeks, their faces in the papers,\r\ntheir proud boasts of butchery retold everywhere), and hangs them\r\nbefore recrossing the border.\r\n\r\nUnited States declares war. United States loses war--outmaneuvered,\r\noutgeneraled, out-logisticated, outgunned, outmanned.\r\n\r\nAnd outfought.\r\n\r\nSaid the author:\r\n\r\n"The colossal blow this cold military fact delivered to the United\r\nStates collective ego is inconceivable to us today. Only a study of\r\ncontemporary comment can make it real to the historian: The choked\r\nhysteria of the newspapers, the raging tides of suicides, Whitmore\'s\r\nimpeachment and trial, the forced resignations of the entire General\r\nStaff--all these serve only to sketch in the national mood.\r\n\r\n"Clearly something had happened to the military power which, within\r\nless than five decades previous, had annihilated the war machines of\r\nthe Cominform and the Third Reich.\r\n\r\n"We have the words of the contemporary military analyst, Osgood\r\nFerguson, to explain it:\r\n\r\n    "The rise of the so-called \'political general\' means a decline in\r\n    the efficiency of the army. Other things being equal, an\r\n    undistracted professional beats an officer who is half soldier and\r\n    half politician. A general who makes it his sole job to win a war\r\n    will infallibly defeat an opponent who, by choice or constraint,\r\n    must offend no voters of enemy ancestry, destroy no cultural or\r\n    religious shrines highly regarded by the press, show leniency when\r\n    leniency is fashionable at home, display condign firmness when the\r\n    voters demand it (though it cause his zone of communications to\r\n    blaze up into a fury of guerrilla clashes), choose his invasion\r\n    routes to please a state department apprehensive of potential\r\n    future ententes.\r\n\r\n"It is unfortunate that most of Ferguson\'s documentation was lost when\r\nhis home was burned during the unsettled years after the war. But we\r\nknow that what Mexico\'s Presidente Lopez said to his staff was: \'My\r\ngenerals, win me this war.\' And this entire volume does not have enough\r\nspace to record what the United States generals were told by the White\r\nHouse, the Congress as a whole, the Committees on Military Affairs,\r\nthe Special Committees on Conduct of the War, the State Department,\r\nthe Commerce Department, the Interior Department, the Director of the\r\nBudget, the War Manpower Commission, the Republican National Committee,\r\nthe Democratic National Committee, the Steel lobby, the Oil lobby,\r\nthe Labor lobby, the political journals, the daily newspapers, the\r\nbroadcasters, the ministry, the Granges, the Chambers of Commerce.\r\nHowever, we do know--unhappily--that the United States generals obeyed\r\ntheir orders. This sorry fact was inscribed indelibly on the record at\r\nthe Peace of Galveston."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMuhlenhoff yawned and closed the book. An amusing theory, he thought,\r\nbut thin. Political generals? Nonsense.\r\n\r\nHe was glad to see that his subordinates had given up their attempt\r\nto pass responsibility for the immediate problem to his shoulders;\r\nthe intercom had been silent for many minutes now. It only showed, he\r\nthought comfortably, that they had absorbed his leading better than\r\nthey knew.\r\n\r\nHe glanced regretfully at the door that had sheltered him, for\r\nthis precious refreshing interlude, from the shocks of the project\r\noutside. Well, the interlude was over; now to see about this leakage\r\nthing. Muhlenhoff made a note, in his tidy card-catalog mind, to have\r\nMaintenance on the carpet. The door was bulging out of true. Incredible\r\nsloppiness! And some damned fool had shut the locks in the ventilating\r\nsystem. The air was becoming stuffy.\r\n\r\nAggressive and confident, the political engineer pressed the release\r\nthat opened the door to the greatest shock of all.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
