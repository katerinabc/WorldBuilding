H. Thames_\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Illustrated by H. W. McCauley\r\n\r\n\r\n     Adam Slade was a man who had nothing to lose by making a\r\n     break for it. The trouble was, he knew that no one had ever\r\n     escaped from  the--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdam Slade crushed the guard\'s skull with a two foot length of iron\r\npipe. No one ever knew where Slade got the iron pipe, but it did not\r\nseem so important.\r\n\r\nThe guard was dead. That was important.\r\n\r\nAnd Slade was on the loose. With a hostage.\r\n\r\nThat was even more important.\r\n\r\nThe hostage\'s name was Marcia Lawrence. She was twenty-two years old\r\nand pretty and scared half out of her wits. She was, before she became\r\na hostage, a reporter for Interplanetary Video. She had been granted\r\nthe final pre-execution interview with Adam Slade and she had looked\r\nforward to it a long time but it had not worked out as planned.\r\n\r\nIt had not worked out as planned because Slade, only hours from the\r\nexecution chamber with absolutely nothing to lose, had splattered the\r\nguard\'s brains around the inside of his cell and marched outside with\r\na frightened Marcia Lawrence.\r\n\r\nOutside. Outside the cell block while other condemned prisoners roared\r\nand shouted and banged tin cups on bars and metal walls and\r\njudas-hole-grills. Outside the prison compound and across the\r\ndome-enclosed city which served the prison.\r\n\r\nThen outside the dome.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOutside the dome there was rock. Rock only, twisted and convoluted and\r\nthrusting and gigantic like monoliths of a race of giants. Rock alone\r\nunder the awesome gray sky. Steaming rock, for some of the terrestrial\r\nwaters were still trapped at great depths. And the sea far off,\r\nbooming against rocky headlands, hissing tidally and slowly, in an\r\nage-long process, pulverizing the rock. The sea far off, a clean sea,\r\nnot sea-smelling sea, a sea whose waters must evaporate countless\r\ntimes and be borne up over the naked rocks in vapor and clouds and\r\ncome down in pelting, endless rain and rush across the rock, frothing\r\nand steaming--a sea which must do this countless times in the eons to\r\ncome, and would do it, to bring salinity to its own waters.\r\n\r\n"It kind of scares the hell out of you, doesn\'t it?" Adam Slade said.\r\nHe was a big man with a thick neck and heavy, sleepy-looking eyes and\r\na blue beard-shadow on his stubborn jaw. He said those words as he\r\nclimbed out of the prison tank with Marcia Lawrence. The tank\'s metal\r\nwas still warm from over-heated travel.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t think anything would scare you," Marcia Lawrence said. She\r\nhad conquered her initial terror in the five hours of clanking tank\r\nflight from the prison. They had come a great many miles from the\r\nprison dome, paralleling the edge of the saltless sea and then\r\nfinally, when their fuel was almost gone, clanking and rattling down\r\ntoward the sea. She was a newspaperwoman, that above all now. She must\r\nnot be afraid. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
She had a story here. A story.\r\n\r\n"Get moving," Adam Slade said. "I got nothing against you, lady," he\r\ntold her for the tenth time. "But you try anything, you\'re dead. You\r\nget that? I got nothing to lose. One time is all they can kill me. But\r\nfirst they got to find me, but they won\'t be able to take me as long\r\nas you\'re here. Just stay meek and you\'ll stay alive."\r\n\r\n"How long do you think you can hold out?" Marcia Lawrence asked\r\npractically. They had begun to walk away from the now useless tank.\r\nAdam Slade was carrying the dead guard\'s M-gun in the crook of his\r\nbent left arm and walking with long, easy, ground-consuming strides.\r\nMarcia almost had to run to keep up with him as they went down a\r\nstretch of slightly sloping black rock toward the steaming, hissing,\r\npounding, roaring, exploding surf.\r\n\r\nSlade smiled. "Plenty of water," he said.\r\n\r\n"But no food, Mr. Slade. There is absolutely no food on earth now and\r\nno possible way of getting food unless you want to stick around for a\r\nfew million years."\r\n\r\n"You think I came out here without a plan?" Slade asked with some\r\nhostility.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. You were desperate."\r\n\r\n"As long as you\'re with me I figure they might follow, but they won\'t\r\nrush me. They might even send over a \'copter, but it won\'t try\r\nanything. Not with you here. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Desperate? I\'m not desperate, and don\'t\r\nyou forget it. Desperate you don\'t think straight. Once is all they\r\ncan execute me. I stayed behind, they\'d of done it. If they catch me,\r\nthey\'ll do it. What\'s the difference?"\r\n\r\n"You said you had a plan."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey reached the edge of a thrusting headland, an enormous beak-shaped\r\ncliff of beetling black rock which leaned out over the young, still\r\nsaltless ocean. Slade paced back and forth quickly, with a powerful\r\nleonine grace, until he found a fault in the rock. The fault tumbled\r\njaggedly, steeply down almost to the edge of the sea.\r\n\r\n"Down there," Slade said. "We\'ll follow the sea coast back to the\r\nprison."\r\n\r\n"Back?" Marcia said in disbelief.\r\n\r\n"Hell yes, back. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
You said it yourself. There\'s no food out here. Since\r\nthere ain\'t no life, of course there\'s no food. Oh, it\'s a great place\r\nfor a prison, all right. Whoever thought of it ought to win a prize. A\r\nprison--a billion years in the past. What\'s the word?"\r\n\r\n"Archaeozoic," she supplied.\r\n\r\n"Yeah, archaeozoic. An archaeozoic prison. You can escape to your\r\nheart\'s content, but what the hell\'s the difference. There\'s no life\r\nback here, not yet. The Earth\'s just a baby. So you escape--and you\r\nstarve to death. It makes every maximum security jail before this one\r\nlook like a kid\'s piggy bank."\r\n\r\n"There hasn\'t ever been an escape," Marcia said hopefully as they made\r\ntheir way down to the sea, she in front and Slade behind her with the\r\nM-gun.\r\n\r\n"There ain\'t never been a hostage before."\r\n\r\n"No-o."\r\n\r\n"There\'s a hostage now."\r\n\r\nMarcia Lawrence took a deep breath and asked suddenly, "Are you going\r\nto kill me?"\r\n\r\n"Hell, I don\'t know. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
I got no reason to--unless you make me. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
We\'re\r\ngoing back there. We\'re double-tracking along the beach, get me? Back\r\nto the prison dome."\r\n\r\n"But--"\r\n\r\n"Adam Slade won\'t starve to death out here. We\'ll double back to the\r\ndome--and the time machine."\r\n\r\n"Oh," she said. They began to walk along the edge of the sea, its\r\nwaters sullen gray, mirroring the sky. Here on this dawn earth the sky\r\nhas as yet never been blue, for the primordial waters were still\r\nfalling, falling. It rained almost all the time and the air was thick\r\nwith moisture and every night when the sun--as yet unseen by the dawn\r\nearth except as an invisible source of light--went down and darkness\r\ncame, the mists rolled in from the sea. In the morning whether rains\r\nhad fallen or not the ground was soaked and tiny freshets rushed down\r\nto the sea, returning to it.\r\n\r\n"Look out!" he cried suddenly, and shoved her against the base of the\r\ncliff which overlooked the water. The cliff top thrust out over them,\r\numbrella-wise. The base of the cliff was thus a concavity and they\r\npressed themselves against it now, in shadow. The waters of the infant\r\nsea were a hundred yards away, surging and booming against the rock.\r\n\r\nShe heard it soon after he did. A helicopter. She wanted to scream.\r\nShe wondered if they would hear her scream. But she looked at Adam\r\nSlade\'s face and did nothing. Soon the helicopter came, buzzing low\r\nover them, searching. It circled a great many times because the\r\nabandoned tank was there. It circled and came down on the beach and\r\ntwo uniformed figures got out. Now she really wanted to scream. One\r\nsound. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
One sound and they would hear her. One quick filling of the\r\nlungs and--\r\n\r\nAdam Slade hit her suddenly and savagely and the black loomed up at\r\nher but she did not remember striking it.\r\n\r\nWhen she awoke, the helicopter was gone.\r\n\r\n"Sorry I had to poke you one," Slade said. He did not seem sorry at\r\nall. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
He said it automatically and then added: "You ready to walk?"\r\n\r\nShe nodded. She got up and staggered a few steps before her legs\r\nsteadied under her. Then with Slade she walked down along the rocky\r\nbeach. This, she thought, was a story. It was the only big story she\r\nhad ever had and probably she would not live to write it. As a woman,\r\nshe was almost hysterical with fear, but as a videocaster she was\r\nangry. The story was hers--if she lived to tell it.\r\n\r\nThen she had to live.\r\n\r\nTime prison. Sure, she thought. Utterly escape proof--unless someone\r\nlike Slade could take a hostage, double back to the prison dome, the\r\nhermetically sealed dome and somehow trick or overpower the guards who\r\nwatched the time traveling machine outside the prison dome.\r\n\r\nOutside. Naturally, it would be outside. That way the prisoners\r\ncouldn\'t get at it.\r\n\r\nUnless, like Slade, they too were outside.\r\n\r\nOutside, where life had not yet been born. Outside, the infant earth.\r\nLet a man escape. What did his escape matter? He would live exactly\r\nas long as it took a man, reasonably healthy, to starve to death.\r\n\r\nUnless he had a hostage and a plan....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShe became aware of rain when they left the cliff overhang. There was\r\nalmost no wind and the rain came down slowly at first, huge slow drops\r\nwhich splattered on the black rock.\r\n\r\n"If it gets any harder," Slade said, "we\'ll have to duck under the\r\ncliff for protection. You don\'t know what a rain can be like back\r\nhere. I seen them through the dome."\r\n\r\nBut they couldn\'t go under the cliff for protection, not if they\r\nwanted to keep going. For the cliff dropped suddenly in a wild jumble\r\nof rocks and then there was nothing but the sloping black beach,\r\nsloping down to the sea.\r\n\r\nThen, all at once, someone opened the sluicegates and the rain\r\nbombarded them. It slapped and bounced off the rock like pistol shots.\r\nIt struck them like hammers. They staggered under its weight.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll have to go back to the cliffs!" Marcia cried. She yelled it\r\nagain at the top of her voice because she realized Slade would not\r\nhear her otherwise as the rain cracked and exploded and splattered and\r\ncrashed. There were no droplets of water. For each one had size and\r\nshape and weight, swift-falling, hammering weight as it came down.\r\nEach one, Marcia thought wildly, struggling to keep her feet, was the\r\nsize of your clenched fist there in the gray dawn of Earth.\r\n\r\n"The cliffs!" she cried again.\r\n\r\nBut Adam Slade shook his head, grabbed her arm above the wrist and\r\npulled her after him. He pointed ahead, in the direction they had been\r\ngoing. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
He said nothing. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
There was no need to talk. They were going\r\nforward and if it killed them probably Adam Slade did not care much.\r\n\r\nHe wanted that prison time machine for his escape and he was either\r\ngoing to get it or die in the attempt.\r\n\r\nThey went on slowly. First one would fall and then the other and when\r\nit was Slade who had fallen, she would wait patiently, hopefully. If\r\nhe ever released his hold on the M-gun--\r\n\r\nBut if it were Marcia who fell, Slade would yank her to her feet\r\nsavagely, yelling words which she had heard at first but which after a\r\nwhile, after an eternity of the storm, seemed to merge with the sound\r\nof the rain and the far booming of thunder out over the water and\r\nthen, as if by magic, she was walking again and stumbling along with\r\nSlade, drenched and beaten and half-drowned.\r\n\r\nShe hardly remembered when night came, but presently she was aware of\r\nthe darkness and the mist over the sea and over the rock and now\r\nengulfing them with its white ectoplasmic tendrils. In the mist she\r\nknew she could escape Slade, and yet she did not. Without Slade now,\r\nnow in the middle of nowhere there by the sea on the shores of the\r\nyoung Earth, she would die in the storm. With Slade--at least for\r\nnow--was life. And she went on.\r\n\r\nThe thunder followed them--and came closer.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the night it sounded like artillery at a distance of\r\nhalf a mile, like a barrage of big atomic shells just out of sight\r\nbehind a black ridgeline which wasn\'t there. And through the deeper\r\nrain-wet darkness of early morning, through the mist, tearing the mist\r\nto tatters, shredding it, came the spears and forks and lances of\r\nlightning. It was, Marcia thought, a nightmare of a storm. And she\r\nmust remember it, for it would make a story, a real story, if ever she\r\nlived to tell it.\r\n\r\nBy morning, the air smelled of ozone. It reeked of ozone and around\r\nthem as the gray light seeped out of the wet sky and the rain suddenly\r\nslackened as if the weak daylight dispelled it, the black rocks were\r\nblasted and broken where lightning had struck.\r\n\r\nIn the dawn\'s first light another helicopter came.\r\n\r\n"Get down!" Slade shouted, and they dropped among the blasted black\r\nrocks, hiding there, not moving. The helicopter came on through the\r\nslackening rain, buzzing a few hundred feet over them but not\r\ncircling. It was heading for the abandoned tank, Marcia thought. It\r\nwasn\'t looking for them here--\r\n\r\nBut suddenly the rain came down in all its savage force again,\r\nblinding bounding off the rocks, pounding relentlessly.\r\n\r\nOverhead, the helicopter seemed to pause like a bird stricken in\r\nflight. The rotors whirled a silver shield against the rain, the great\r\ndrops splattering off the shield.\r\n\r\nAnd the helicopter came down under the weight of the rain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt landed a hundred and fifty yards from them down the beach and\r\nMarcia watched breathlessly while three men got out and looked at each\r\nother and at the rain. The dawn light was still only a dim gray and\r\nMarcia could not see the men clearly, but abruptly a jagged spear of\r\nlightning blasted rock midway between where they were hiding and the\r\nhelicopter and in the after-glare through the wet and almost crackling\r\nair, the men were very clear. And clearer still when other lightning\r\ncame down around them, ringing them in, it seemed, like a tent. There\r\nwas now so much lightning it looked more like an aurora than an\r\nelectric storm.\r\n\r\nThe dawn earth, before life, spending itself in fury....\r\n\r\nAll at once Marcia was running down toward the edge of the water,\r\nwhere the helicopter was. She ran screaming and shouting but the\r\nthunder swallowed her puny voice. At every moment she expected Adam\r\nSlade to kill her, to merely stand up with the M-gun and shoot her,\r\nbut he did not and perhaps her unconscious mind in the instant she had\r\nfled had instinctively known he would not. For if Adam Slade killed\r\nher, he had no hostage. If he killed her and they found him, he would\r\nhave absolutely no chance.\r\n\r\nShe turned and looked behind her. There was Slade, silhouetted against\r\nthe lightning, running, covering the ground in huge strides, gaining\r\non her. She did not look back again. The whole world was lightning and\r\nthunder and her legs striking earth under her, up and down, up and\r\ndown, pounding, running, fleeing, and the rain, Slade\'s ally, beating\r\nher, buffeting her, exploding against her.\r\n\r\nShe stumbled and fell but she was up and running again in a moment.\r\nNow Slade was very close. But the helicopter was close too. She did\r\nnot think the men there had seen them yet. She waved her arms and\r\nscreamed although she knew the screams would not be heard--and then\r\nSlade was on her.\r\n\r\nThey went down together and she knew she was frail and helpless before\r\nhis great strength. He grabbed her, his hands, angry hands on her\r\nthroat--\r\n\r\nAnd lightning struck.\r\n\r\nIt bounded and bounced off rock a dozen feet from them. It shook the\r\nearth and blasted the rock and pieces like shrapnel cluttered all\r\naround them and struck them too and Marcia felt hot blood on her arm\r\nand it was her own blood.\r\n\r\nBut Slade had been momentarily stunned and she was running again. Away\r\nfrom him.\r\n\r\nBut away from the helicopter too. At first she did not realize that\r\nbut when she did realize it, it was too late. If she doubled back now,\r\nshe would rush into Slade\'s arms.\r\n\r\nShe ran--into the sea.\r\n\r\nIt was suddenly, unexpectedly calm. It merely eddied around her\r\nankles, as if waiting for something. The storm seemed to be waiting\r\ntoo, lightning holding back, the thunder stilled, even the rain\r\nhanging there in the black heavy sky, waiting....\r\n\r\nSlade came after her, stalking through the surf.\r\n\r\nA single bolt of lightning lanced down at them and a great engulfing\r\nroar lifted Marcia, carried her, stunned her, and then the rain pelted\r\ndown again and the sea was an angry sea and the air was supercharged\r\nwith ozone and another smell. Like seared flesh.\r\n\r\nLike seared flesh.\r\n\r\nShe saw Adam Slade then. Slade was down in a foot of water, face down.\r\nHe was not moving and the water lapped around him, over him. She went\r\nto him, walking slowly.\r\n\r\nThe men from the helicopter were there too. They had seen in that\r\nfinal flash of lightning.\r\n\r\n"Are you all right, miss?" one of them shouted.\r\n\r\n"Yes. Slade?"\r\n\r\nThey turned him over. They looked at him. "Dead," one of them said.\r\n\r\n"Dead," she echoed. She would have collapsed, but they caught her.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen the rain really came down, not as it had come before, which was\r\nhard enough. It came in huge globes of water and each globe was as big\r\nas your head and if it hit it could stun you.\r\n\r\n"Slade?" someone cried as the globes exploded violently in the surf\r\naround them.\r\n\r\n"He\'s dead. He\'ll keep."\r\n\r\nAnd they went back to the helicopter with Marcia, to await the end of\r\nthe storm there.\r\n\r\nWhen it was over, when the sky was not black but merely the color of\r\nlead, they returned down the beach for Slade\'s body.\r\n\r\nBut Slade wasn\'t there.\r\n\r\n"But he was dead!" Marcia said incredulously.\r\n\r\nOne of the men smiled. "He didn\'t go anyplace under his own power. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
He\r\nwas dead, all right. The storm took his body out to sea, is all."\r\n\r\nThey stood there for a moment, gazing out across the black troubled\r\nwater of the infant ocean on the infant earth. A billion years ago....\r\n\r\nSlade was out there. Slade, dead. Out there with the tides and the\r\nwaters and the frequent electric storms--\r\n\r\n"Out there with a million bacteriological parasites on his dead body\r\nand in his dead body, which he brought with him," Marcia said,\r\ndreamily.\r\n\r\n"What are you talking about, miss?"\r\n\r\nOut there in the electric dawn of earth, with the bacteria which lived\r\nin his body as they lived in all other bodies. Out there with them,\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nFood for them.\r\n\r\nFood and water and air heavy with ozone and the electric storms.\r\n\r\nMarcia laughed hysterically. It was a story she wanted to write.\r\n\r\nBut she wouldn\'t write it.\r\n\r\nSlade was a killer, condemned to die. But Slade, dead out there with\r\nhis bacteria, Slade evil to man and human society but not necessarily\r\nevil in the implacable ways of nature or perhaps grimly, terribly\r\nevil--Slade out there, dead on the bosom of the primordial waters,\r\nSlade back in time a billion years before life had been born on\r\nEarth....\r\n\r\nShe laughed hysterically as they led her away from the water. They\r\nslapped her face, gently at first, then harder. "I\'ll be all right,"\r\nshe managed to say.\r\n\r\nShe would be all right. She could live to forget it.\r\n\r\nBut Slade out there.\r\n\r\nSlade.\r\n\r\nSlade fathering all life on earth there in the sea with his dead body.\r\nSlade who had sinned and was taken back here to die for his sins so\r\nthat life could be born.\r\n\r\nSlade, whose first name was Adam.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s Prison of a Billion Years, by C.H.
