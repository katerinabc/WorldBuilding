=== Chunk 2 ===
Her interest evaporated. She took a card from a filing\r\ncabinet and handed it to him. "If you will just fill this out."\r\n\r\nIt was a simple questionnaire--type, location, size--and Channing\'s\r\nstylo moved rapidly over it. He hesitated only at the last, stark\r\nquestion, "How much are you prepared to pay?" Then he wrote neatly\r\nin the space provided "One hundred thousand credits." That was\r\nexactly the amount of his signing-off bonus. It also represented his\r\ntotal finances. The unimaginative minds that calculated the pay of a\r\nred-blooded space officer didn\'t take into account all the attractive\r\nways of spending it that a rumbustious pioneer Vector provided.\r\n\r\nHe gave the blonde the card and she wrote a name on it. The smile she\r\ngave him was altogether impersonal. She liked the look of the big,\r\ngangling fellow with "Space" written all over his bronzed face and\r\ncrinkled blue eyes, but....\r\n\r\nShe said, "Will you come this way, please?"\r\n\r\nThe name on the desk identified him as "Mr. Folan" and he was a tall,\r\naffable man.\r\n\r\n"I think we can suit you, Commander--er--Mr. Channing," he said,\r\n"though what we have in mind mightn\'t be quite as large as you wish.\r\nEarth-type planets come rather high, you know. Now if you were to\r\nchoose a Sirius- or a Vega-type--"\r\n\r\n"Thank you, no," Jim said firmly. He had heard too much about the\r\nhazards of alien-type planets.\r\n\r\n"In that case," Mr. Folan said busily, "let\'s see what we have\r\navailable."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA month later the doors of the automatic shuttle slid across and\r\nadmitted Jim Channing to the third planet of Phylox Beta. It also\r\ndisgorged one spaceboat, a clutter of machinery, a thousand tons of\r\nstrawberry plants and a fully equipped house. While he was still taking\r\nin the first glimpse of his future home, the massive doors slammed shut\r\nand the giant ship took off smoothly and silently. A moment later it\r\nwinked into sub-space. He was in business.\r\n\r\nThe planet possessed only one sizable island--it could hardly be\r\ndignified by the name of continent.\r\n\r\nThe rest was covered by a vast ocean. Still, as Folan had explained,\r\nhe couldn\'t really expect anything more--not in the line of an\r\nEarth-type, anyway--for the money.\r\n\r\nHe spent a week figuring out the remote controls that operated the\r\nplanting machinery. Once it clanked into operation, it worked entirely\r\non its own. He had only to push a few buttons to send it lumbering in\r\nnew directions and the big island steadily took on a resemblance to a\r\nhuge strawberry patch while Channing fished and lounged in the sun.\r\n\r\nWhen the galactic trade agent came, the strawberries were waiting for\r\nhim, neatly piled into a mountain of gleaming cans. He was a friendly,\r\ntalkative little man, glad to exercise his tongue again after the\r\nlonely months in space.\r\n\r\n"What are you growing here?" he asked Channing.\r\n\r\n"Strawberries."\r\n\r\nThe friendly smile disappeared. "Every planet in the Galaxy seems to be\r\ngrowing strawberries this year. I can\'t even give them away."\r\n\r\n"But I thought the Ursa Major colonies--"\r\n\r\nThe little man shook his head. "So does everyone else. There\'s a\r\nmillion tons of strawberries the colonies can\'t use headed there\r\nalready. Now if it was upklin seeds--"\r\n\r\n"Upklin seeds?"\r\n\r\nThe agent looked at him in surprise. "You mean you haven\'t heard about\r\nupklin seeds?"\r\n\r\n"No. Not a thing."\r\n\r\n"Well, of course, you are a newcomer. It\'s this new race that\'s been\r\ndiscovered somewhere in The Sack. They are as rich as all get-out\r\nand they have a passion for upklin seeds. Trouble is they can\'t grow\r\nthem on local planets and they are offering fancy prices to anybody\r\nthat can supply them. I paid a thousand credits a bushel for them to\r\nyour next-door neighbor on the fourth planet last week. Got a hundred\r\nbushels."\r\n\r\nChanning did a bit of mental arithmetic. A hundred thousand credits for\r\none crop. Whew!\r\n\r\n"Could I grow them here?

=== Chunk 3 ===
"\r\n\r\nThe agent shook his head. "You need plenty of soft marsh and a\r\nJupiter-type atmosphere."\r\n\r\nThen he had a sudden idea and he spoke long and seriously to Channing,\r\nexplaining quite a few things that were new to him. Channing was still\r\nconsidering them, staring thoughtfully at the ground, after the little\r\nman left.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNext day Channing took off for the nearest sub-space center and a\r\nfew hours later he was in Mr. Folan\'s office at Planet Enterprises,\r\ngingerly balancing his cap on his knee. Mr. Folan\'s sleek head nodded\r\nas Channing made his points and when he was finished the executive\r\npressed a buzzer and called for the file.\r\n\r\n"You realize, Mr. Channing," he said conversationally, as he turned\r\nover the pages, "that what you are asking will be a most expensive\r\nundertaking."\r\n\r\n"I know that," Channing said eagerly, "but upklin seeds are such a\r\nsure-fire proposition that I thought Planet Enterprises might be\r\nwilling to do the job on a percentage basis."\r\n\r\nMr. Folan wrote some figures on the margin of the folder and considered\r\ndeeply. "Yes," he said at last, "I think it would work out on a\r\nseventy-thirty split."\r\n\r\n"Seventy-thirty?"\r\n\r\nMr. Folan inclined his head graciously. "Seventy per cent for Planet\r\nEnterprises and thirty for yourself."\r\n\r\nChanning said slowly, "That\'s a bit steep."\r\n\r\nIn a few brisk words, Mr. Folan showed just why he was an executive of\r\nPlanet Enterprises, Inc. He gave Channing the figures for transforming\r\nthe planet\'s characteristics to those of Jupiter; he told him what\r\nacreage of upklin seeds he could grow and the exact profit to be\r\nexpected. Channing\'s share should be about one hundred and fifty\r\nthousand credits per crop.\r\n\r\nFighting a rearguard battle, Channing said, "Your three hundred and\r\nfifty thousand won\'t look so bad on the balance sheet, either."\r\n\r\nFolan reeled off his figures again with practiced glibness. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Channing\r\nhad the sudden suspicion that his proposition wasn\'t entirely\r\nunexpected. But the figures sounded reasonable and he had to admit that\r\nPlanet Enterprises was risking a great deal of money.\r\n\r\n"Then there is the not inconsiderable cost of your own metamorphosis,\r\nMr. Channing," Folan added.\r\n\r\n"Huh?" said Channing.\r\n\r\nThere followed the most excruciating half-hour of Channing\'s life.\r\nProposition followed explanation, counter-explanation followed\r\ncounter-proposition. At the end of that time he emerged from the office\r\nwith a stricken look and a small white card. The blonde receptionist\r\nread the look correctly and definitely and finally crossed him off her\r\nlist.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor a jube, Ckm Dyk wasn\'t at all bad-looking. His four legs growing\r\ndirectly from the bottom of the muscular, hairy trunk were strong and\r\nsturdy--always a mark of handsomeness in a male, for the legs had to\r\ntake most of the strain of a gravitational pull several times that\r\nof Earth. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
He had three flexible tentacles, a thin melon slice for a\r\nmouth, but nothing resembling a nose. He didn\'t need one, since he\r\nbreathed through a set of gills at the sides of his head.\r\n\r\nHe remembered vaguely that he had once been Jim Channing, an Earthman,\r\nbut the memory had nearly faded. He had been warned of that, that he\r\nwould soon forget he had ever been anything except what he was now, but\r\nhe had already forgotten the warning.\r\n\r\nPhylox Beta III had changed, too, and in as great a degree. The wide\r\nocean had become a turgid, soupy mush, covered by the trailing growths\r\nof the upklin flowers. The blue skies had turned an angry red and the\r\nsharp wind that rustled the hair on his squat body was almost pure\r\nmethane.\r\n\r\nHe waddled down to the low disk-shaped skimmer and started the jets. As\r\nit pushed its way through the clinging masses of the upklin flowers, he\r\nsurveyed his crop happily. This was his second crop and it promised to\r\nbe even better than the first. He was going to be a very wealthy buk,\r\nhe told himself. He could buy.... His mind floundered. He didn\'t know\r\nwhat Jubes longed for, what they sought wealth for. He was certain at\r\nthe same time that there was a flaw in his contentment, that something\r\nwas missing.\r\n\r\nWhat he was missing dropped from the sky a few days later. It came in\r\na spaceboat and was his neighbor from Phylox Beta IV. Her body hair\r\nwas a rich golden brown and she wore pretty bracelets, studded with\r\nbasim stones, on each of her four legs. Ckm Dyk\'s single eye, with its\r\nperpendicular outer eyelids and horizontal nictitating inner membranes\r\nto filter out the infra-red rays, shone with an emotion that was more\r\nthan pleasure.\r\n\r\nHer thoughts flooded his mind. There was a warm recognition of his\r\nadmiration and a delicious suggestion that it wasn\'t unacceptable.\r\n\r\n"The agent told me you were upklin farming. I came to see if I could be\r\nof any help," she told him.\r\n\r\nThe sentences rang like golden bells within his burgeoning\r\nconsciousness. He tried to shape his answering thought coherently,\r\nbut his lack of telepathic experience betrayed him. She flinched\r\nmomentarily beneath the raw, undirected stream of passionate love that\r\noverwhelmed her mind.\r\n\r\nThen an answering wave of shy, tender awareness and acquiescence laved\r\nhis senses. Without the clumsy barrier of speech between them, they\r\nhad scaled in a few pulsating moments the shining heights of love and\r\ndevotion that human passion sometimes cannot find in a lifetime of\r\nsearching.\r\n\r\nCkm Dyk had never been so happy. They decided to farm the two planets\r\ntogether so they could be with each other always. There was sound\r\neconomic sense in this; with both of them helping, the output of\r\neach planet would be nearly doubled. It meant a huge increase in\r\nadministrative and paper work for Ckm Dyk, but he didn\'t mind that.\r\nOften, as he pored over account books and production figures, a\r\ntremulous, shy devotion would envelop him in a gauzy mental cloud and\r\nhe would lay down his stylo and answer Aln Muh with all the great love\r\nthat surged within him.\r\n\r\nAs the months passed, his happiness increased. The perfect attunement\r\nof their minds excluded all the scalding jealousies and the offended\r\nsilences of misunderstanding that can mar the most loving human\r\nrelationships. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
They did not need to see each other; the physical\r\npresence of the beloved was unimportant; they loved more with their\r\nminds than with their bodies.\r\n\r\nIt seemed improbable that such a glorious idyll should ever be\r\ndisturbed. Then, one morning, a shuttle-spacer came silently out of\r\nthe red sky and landed beside the house. Ckm Dyk waddled toward it,\r\nimpelled by a carefully built-in series of reflexes which he had\r\ncompletely forgotten about and entered its gaping maw. He never once\r\nlooked at Aln Muh and the passionate entreaties that echoed through his\r\nmind only roused in him a dull irritation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJim Channing again found himself in Mr. Folan\'s office. The figures\r\nthe tall, sleek-haired man was reading out to him made tuneful music.\r\nEven when Planet Enterprises\' massive deduction was made, his share was\r\ncomfortingly more than a million.\r\n\r\n"Not bad payment, Mr. Channing, for five years of life! In any case,\r\nit\'s all over now--just a bad memory."\r\n\r\nThe executive smiled at him from his comfortable, familiar chair, aware\r\nof the torrents of confused thoughts hidden behind the gray eyes.\r\n\r\nWhen he had come out of the stupor that succeeded the almost\r\ndisintegrating effects of his re-metamorphosis, Jim Channing remembered\r\nclearly the terms of the bargain he had made. He was to become a Jube,\r\na living nightmare, living in a nightmare world, for five years. At the\r\nend of that time, Planet Enterprises promised him, he would be given\r\nback his humanity and he would have earned enough money to keep him in\r\nluxury for the rest of his life.\r\n\r\nThey had kept their promise--to the letter. He felt it ungrateful\r\nof him that his paramount emotion was fury. He had been happy; no\r\nhuman attachment could ever make him as happy again. He longed for\r\nthe glorious love and trust he had shared during that tremendous five\r\nyears. Perhaps he had been a repulsive monster from whom any woman\r\nwould run screaming. But he didn\'t want a woman. He wanted Aln Muh.\r\n\r\nHe said, picking his words with the greatest care, "Would a further\r\nmetamorphosis be possible?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFolan\'s jaw dropped. It was a question he\'d never expected to hear from\r\nany of the men who had taken the terrible choice for the glittering\r\nreward he held out to them. Most of them had picked up their vouchers\r\nand asked the way to the nearest tavern; many of the alien races did\r\nnot find alcohol compatible with their metabolisms. A few had inquired\r\ntentatively about his current receptionist. Planet Enterprises had a\r\nbig turnover in pretty receptionists, but they didn\'t lose them to\r\nmen who had been unhuman horrors for five years. One big red-haired\r\ncharacter had wanted to start a private war against the Sirians, whose\r\nbrother he had been until two days previously. But none of them had\r\nwanted to go back.\r\n\r\nHe said, "It\'s possible, Mr. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Channing. But I must tell you that a\r\nsecond metamorphosis is very expensive--and it\'s permanent."\r\n\r\n"You mean if I become a Jube again, I must stay one?"\r\n\r\nThe executive nodded.\r\n\r\nChanning gestured toward the payment voucher.\r\n\r\n"You said it was expensive. Is there enough there to cover it?

=== Chunk 8 ===
"\r\n\r\nFolan looked curiously at him. "Yes, more than enough."\r\n\r\nHe waited to hear what the big man would say next.\r\n\r\nChanning licked dry lips. A terrible doubt assailed him. Maybe Aln\r\nMuh had been metamorphosed too. Maybe she had returned to her former\r\nself--whatever that may have been--while he sat here.\r\n\r\nHe looked down at the big, freckled hands resting on his knees. They\r\nwere trembling and his palms felt moist. Without looking up, he asked,\r\n"Is the period of metamorphosis, always for a term of five years?"\r\n\r\n"Invariably. No other term is possible in the present state of our\r\nknowledge of the technique--except permanency."\r\n\r\nA great sigh escaped Channing. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
That was all right, then. Aln Muh was\r\ngenuinely a Jube. The agent had told him about her--mentioned her by\r\nname, he remembered now--had said that she was upklin farming on the\r\nneighboring planet. If she had been metamorphosed, she would have been\r\ntaken from him more than a year ago.\r\n\r\nHe tossed his cap on the table decisively and stood up.\r\n\r\n"All right. I\'ll take the permanent treatment."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCkm Dyk sucked the methane through his gills with satisfaction. It was\r\ngood to be home again. He had forgotten already that he had ever been\r\nJim Channing, that he would never be human again.\r\n\r\nHe did not know that less than five minutes after the shuttle-ship had\r\nborne him off to Galactic Enterprises, Aln Muh had sent her spaceboat\r\nhurtling toward the fiery orb of Phylox Beta, mad with the grief of\r\nhaving lost him. It would not have concerned him much if he had known.\r\n\r\nJubes make tender and devoted lovers, but they are notorious for their\r\nexceedingly bad memories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
