I had worked for that money,\r\ntoo; shocking wheat for twelve hours a day in the August sun is no\r\nvacation. But Slim Coleman convinced me that we could run that three\r\nhundred into enough to take us both for four years.\r\n\r\nI hadn\'t even had time to get a haircut--and I did want a haircut; now\r\nit was pretty shaggy.\r\n\r\nBut Slim, diplomat that he is, didn\'t even seem to notice my hair.\r\n"I\'ve got a real deal," he said, and his deep eyes were shining with\r\nenthusiasm. "Have you got any money?"\r\n\r\n"Some," I said cautiously.\r\n\r\n"It takes three hundred. Have you got that much?"\r\n\r\nI had intended to say no, but Slim has a way of fixing his deep, somber\r\neyes on you that gives ineffable dignity even to a touch. "Okay," I\r\nsaid hopelessly. "What\'s the bite?

=== Chunk 3 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Well, you see, it\'s like this." We went into a drug store and ordered\r\ncokes, and Slim characteristically insisted on paying for them when he\r\nprobably couldn\'t have bought a package of cigarettes. I let him pay,\r\ntoo. I had three hundred and one dollars, and I had no intention of\r\nparting with a nickel of it--except a dollar for a haircut.\r\n\r\n"I was using the brain-finder and I ran across the owner of this unused\r\ngarage in the Loop. His name is Richard LaBombard and he\'s got a lot of\r\nparking lots through the Loop, and you know what he\'s doing?"\r\n\r\nI saw the waitress stare at me. I swallowed and tried to listen to\r\nSlim. "No.

=== Chunk 4 ===
"\r\n\r\nSlim was staring at the waitress. "He loads them up with used cars\r\nevery day so those who are hunting a parking place can\'t get in," he\r\nsaid absently. "You know what he wants?

=== Chunk 5 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Well, no." I never could figure those things, but Slim could see the\r\nangles a mile away. He was always good at that.\r\n\r\n"He\'s made an application for a permit to build a parking ramp that\r\nwill cover a solid block down in the middle of the Loop. Now, if he can\r\nbuild a place to park eight or ten thousand cars, naturally that one\r\nspot is going to be the best business spot in the city. And Richard\r\nLaBombard holds leases or options on half the store space around that\r\nblock. He stands to make millions."\r\n\r\n"Where does my three hundred come in?

=== Chunk 6 ===
"\r\n\r\nSlim ignored the acidulousness in my voice. "Well, as I say, I followed\r\nhim with the brain-finder and found him holding hands with the mayor\'s\r\nwife at a skating rink--and the next day I--ah--persuaded him to give\r\nme an option to lease this building on the edge of the Loop."\r\n\r\n"You mean you blackmailed him."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a harsh word. I prefer _persuaded_ myself. After all, he\r\nwouldn\'t want something like that to come up just when he\'s finagling\r\nfor that permit, would he? Anyway, I paid five dollars for the option."\r\n\r\n"That\'s unusual. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
You\'ve got some of your own money in this deal."\r\n\r\nLike a gentleman, Slim ignored that thrust. "Tomorrow is the first.\r\nI\'ve got to raise two hundred and fifty for a month\'s rent. We\'ll need\r\nfifty more for deposits on light, heat, and power. We\'ll make a million\r\nwithin a month. We split fifty-fifty."\r\n\r\n"How do you make the million?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSlim looked around. Nobody was near; he leaned close and whispered.\r\n"This is the invention of the century. We can solve the parking problem\r\nof the entire city. You know how it is--you can\'t even get into a\r\nparking lot after ten a.m. Lots of businesses are threatening to put\r\nbranches out in the suburbs."\r\n\r\n"Yes?"\r\n\r\n"The parking problem must be solved if the city is to survive," Slim\r\nsaid dramatically.\r\n\r\n"Okay, but how can you make any more out of an old building than\r\nanybody else?"\r\n\r\nHe whispered again. "I can create a magnetic field that will slow\r\nelectrons down to almost zero velocity. A car will shrink to about four\r\ninches long." He stared at me intently. "Do you see what that will\r\nmean?"\r\n\r\nI sighed. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
"I\'m afraid I do. If it works, you can pack a million cars in\r\na space that ordinarily would hold about a thousand." I tried to stop\r\nmy enthusiasm, but it was too late. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
The idea was taking hold. "And that\r\ngarage is right across the street from Newton\'s, the biggest department\r\nstore in the city."\r\n\r\n"The parking problem was intensified last week when they abolished\r\nparking on the street so the afternoon traffic could get through. Boy,\r\nthis is the spot for us!" Slim said.\r\n\r\n"Will it take all of three hundred dollars?" I asked Slim.\r\n\r\nHe nodded gravely, "Every cent. And then it will be a shoestring."\r\n\r\n"Wouldn\'t two hundred and ninety-nine be enough?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Slim. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
He looked back at me. He had always been that way; he\r\nnever compromised with my money.\r\n\r\nI shuddered when I saw my hair in the mirror as we left. But, I knew\r\nI\'d better keep the dollar for cigarettes....\r\n\r\nWe paid the first month\'s rent; I put up the deposits, and Slim brought\r\na bunch of wire and stuff from his basement, and we worked till one\r\no\'clock winding gadgets and building a regular stall to run a car into.\r\nThis garage had a ramp going to the basement floor, and we decided\r\nto use that floor. Also, there was an old freight elevator up to the\r\nsecond and third floors, and we could park a few on the main floor and\r\nsend a few upstairs when we had time, because of course we didn\'t want\r\nthe secret to get out.\r\n\r\nSlim tried the squeezer-upper when he got it finished. He set a couple\r\nof old saw-horses inside and, turned on the juice. It was uncanny to\r\nsee those things shrink. You could even hear the legs scrape on the\r\nconcrete floor as they pulled together. In just about three seconds the\r\nsaw-horses were an inch high. Then Slim reversed the current and they\r\nexpanded to normal size again. All this in about one breath.\r\n\r\n"But look," I said, suddenly stricken with a horrible thought. "What\r\nif you don\'t get a car back exactly the size it was at first? Then new\r\ntires wouldn\'t fit, new parts wouldn\'t fit--oh, my goodness!" I was\r\nabruptly overwhelmed with the enormity of such damage.\r\n\r\n"That\'s all taken care of," he assured me. "The electrons in any given\r\nobject seem to have a tendency to resume their former orbits if they\r\nget a chance. In other words, if I expand a car to almost its normal\r\nsize and then cut off the power, the electrons will sort of coast into\r\ntheir original orbits and the car will resume its exact former size.\r\nSort of a quantum jump, I suppose."\r\n\r\nI breathed a deep sigh of relief.\r\n\r\n"Of course, if you go too far, you\'ll have an oversize car, but you\r\ncould reduce it again," said Slim. "Now in the morning we\'ll hang out a\r\nparking sign and let them drive onto the main floor. You run the cars\r\ninto the basement, and we\'ll have this thing down under the ramp, out\r\nof sight." Slim\'s deep eyes were glowing. "We\'ll make a million," he\r\nsaid, rubbing his hands.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWell, by the end of the next day it began to look as if we had, indeed,\r\nsolved the most urgent problem of modern civilization--the parking\r\nproblem. We had a sign out that said, _Parking All Day 50c--No one\r\nTurned Away_, and by the end of the day we had taken in nearly five\r\nhundred dollars.\r\n\r\nBut it was a mankiller. I handed out claim checks and drove cars to\r\nthe basement. Slim reduced them and hauled them across the room to a\r\nlineup. That was funny--seeing a car shrink to three or four inches\r\nlong. It was an irresistible impulse to pick it up, but when you\r\ntried, you changed your mind. The cars were practically as heavy in\r\ntheir small size as in their big size, and that made it something of a\r\nproblem to get them moved around.\r\n\r\nWe had borrowed a toe-and-heel, a sort of crowbar with rollers on it,\r\nand with the reduced friction from the extremely small tires of the\r\ncars, it wasn\'t too hard to move them, but it was still a mankiller\r\nto move a thousand in one day, and move each twice. We took turns\r\nat the reducer. I could handle them best by catching them under the\r\nfront axle, but we decided to make them six inches long so it would be\r\neasier. The metal in its smaller size seemed as tough as it had been\r\nnormally, but the parts were pretty small to get hold of with anything\r\nstrong enough to handle them.\r\n\r\nSlim solved this problem the second day when he put a long piece of\r\ngas-pipe on the heel-and-toe and shrank it considerably. The second\r\nday, too, we had two men working upstairs. The third day we had a\r\ngadget made so that we could roll a car\'s front wheel on it and then\r\npull the car anywhere. That was when we began to get our breath. The\r\nother way had been tough. I don\'t know how Slim stood it at all; if I\r\nhadn\'t worked in the wheat-fields all summer I would have fallen from\r\nexhaustion.\r\n\r\nWe had two of those gadgets made and then we tilted the reducing stall\r\na little. We\'d block the wheels with a two-by-four after we had a car\r\ninside, then reduce it, take out the block, let the car roll onto the\r\ngadget and haul it away. We arranged them on the concrete floor in rows\r\nabout four feet apart. When somebody came back to get their car out\r\nwe had to pinch-bar the car back up on the gadget and wheel it to the\r\nstall.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe second week we had two stalls, one reducing and one expanding,\r\nand Slim was talking of having a new sloping floor put in to help in\r\nhandling. By that time we were handling two thousand cars a day; you\r\ncan do your own arithmetic.\r\n\r\nOn the last day of the month, LaBombard came in to collect his next\r\nmonth\'s rent. He was all eyes and he said he didn\'t see how we could do\r\nit. "You took in twenty-two hundred cars yesterday and this building\r\nwon\'t hold over six hundred," he said, his eyes darting all around.\r\n"You must have a fast turnover."\r\n\r\nSlim kidded him. "We put \'em on the roof," he said, and paid him and\r\npushed him out. I didn\'t like the look in that man\'s eyes as he left.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Slim exuberantly to me, "we\'re sitting on thirty thousand\r\ndollars. Think you can get through college on that?"\r\n\r\n"I hope I can take time off to get a haircut," I said fervently. It\r\nwas embarrassing to have people look at me and suddenly snicker and\r\nturn away to hide their faces. The trouble was, we didn\'t dare turn the\r\nreducing over to anybody else, and so we both worked like robots.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy the beginning of the second month we had a moving ramp. The boys\r\nupstairs put the car on the ramp, the car came downstairs and went\r\nthrough the reducer, came out on the other side and onto a platform.\r\nWe had a tow-truck that just backed up, reached down a steel platform\r\nunder the front axle, and walked away. It was funny to see that two-ton\r\ntruck hauling a toy car across the floor.\r\n\r\nYes, we had a deal. Late at night, after we\'d closed up and had time\r\nfor some coffee, Slim would talk about how we were going to build a\r\nchain of parking ramps across the country.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll make billions," he said, his deep eyes shining with a far-away\r\nfanaticism that only Slim Coleman can exhibit, "and we\'ll be known as\r\nthe saviors of civilization. We\'ll call ourselves Parking Unlimited."\r\n\r\nThen one night the building inspector came. We were just resting for\r\na moment, with no cars in sight, when we looked around and there he\r\nstood. It startled us, because absolutely no one was allowed in the\r\nbasement.\r\n\r\n"What do you want?" Slim asked, and just then a car appeared on the\r\nramp, coming down to the reducer.\r\n\r\n"I\'m the building inspector. I\'m checking on the weight you\'re putting\r\nin this building. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
It\'s an old building, you know." And all the time his\r\neyes were darting everywhere.\r\n\r\n"Did LaBombard send you?" asked Slim. The car was halfway down.\r\n\r\n"Well, not exactly; we\'re interested in this from the safety angle."\r\n\r\nA second car\'s nose showed around the curve. I began to sweat.\r\n\r\n"Okay," said Slim. "Look us over. We do the parking upstairs."\r\n\r\n"What do you do down here?" The inspector stared at the reducing stall.\r\n\r\n"That\'s a new-fangled washing apparatus."\r\n\r\n"What are all these toy cars on the floor down here?"\r\n\r\nI practically swallowed my tongue. I had known that was coming.\r\n\r\nBut Slim said casually, "Oh, we\'re making Christmas presents in our\r\nspare time." The first car was about to enter the reducing stall.\r\n\r\nThe inspector stared at the two thousand cars on the basement floor.\r\n"They look plenty real."\r\n\r\nI held my breath. If he should ever try to pick up one of those cars,\r\nit would be all over for us. I could just imagine what two thousand\r\nowners would say if they should find out their cars had been reduced to\r\nsix inches. People are not too broad-minded about such things.\r\n\r\nBut Slim had him by the elbow. With the savage shake of his head at\r\nme and the reducing stall, he said, "I\'ll take you up and show you\r\naround." They rode the ramp upstairs.\r\n\r\nRight then I wanted to lie down and pass out with sheer relief, but the\r\ncars were beginning to pile up. I worked like a horse for half an hour,\r\ndoing double duty. Then Slim came back with a haunting sadness in his\r\neyes, and a faraway look that was not encouraging.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve got to get out of here," he said. "He knows too much. Too many\r\nparking-lot people are putting on the heat."\r\n\r\n"You mean he knows how we are packing them in?"\r\n\r\n"No, but he knows that we are taking in as many as three thousand cars\r\na day, while half the parking lots in town are begging for customers."\r\n\r\nI sighed. "When are we leaving?"\r\n\r\nSlim\'s eyes were looking far away. "At the end of the week," he said.\r\n"We\'ve got enough money in the bank to pay all our bills. We\'ve got\r\na couple thousand in the safe, and we\'ll take in three or four more.\r\nTomorrow\'s Friday. The next day will be Saturday and we should handle\r\nfour thousand cars. We blow Saturday night. We\'ll go to the coast."\r\n\r\n"Will I have time to get a haircut?" I asked hopefully.\r\n\r\n"No. Get your hair cut in L.A." He went on dreamily, "We should have\r\nfive thousand. We can start up again, and this time we\'ll start off\r\nright, so we can run indefinitely without anybody catching on. We\'ve\r\ngot some capital to work with now."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFriday was a good day. Slim only chuckled when I told him there was\r\na man sitting across the street with a pad of paper and a pencil,\r\ntallying the cars that came in and those that went out.\r\n\r\n"We\'re good for tomorrow," said Slim, "then they can have it. I\'ve got\r\nplane reservations for two a.m."\r\n\r\nHe didn\'t say so, but I think he was getting as tight inside as I was.\r\nWe were close--thirty hours from five thousand dollars--enough to go\r\nthrough college in good shape.\r\n\r\nSaturday was a bell-ringer. By six o\'clock in the evening we had parked\r\nover four thousand cars, and they were still coming. The safe was full\r\nof tens and twenties, all nicely wrapped and labeled, and our two\r\nsuitcases were beside it. Still the money was pouring in. Nine cars a\r\nminute. One every seven seconds. Two hundred and fifty dollars an hour.\r\nIt was better than a mint. The basement floor was beginning to fill up.\r\n\r\nAt six-thirty Slim was bringing a car back to full size and saying to\r\nme, "Watch this one. This is the building inspector\'s car; he\'s trying\r\nto get a clue."\r\n\r\nAt that exact moment a voice spoke behind us. "I beg your pardon,\r\ngentlemen." It was one of those clear, soft voices with little tinkling\r\nbells in it. Know what I mean?\r\n\r\nSlim turned and stared. "Madam," he said, "don\'t you know the sign says\r\n\'No Admittance\'?"\r\n\r\nShe looked repentant. "I\'m sorry." She looked hurt. "I didn\'t think you\r\ngentlemen would mind." She turned as if to go.\r\n\r\nI saw Slim melting down. I didn\'t blame him. That girl could have\r\nmelted tungsten. Yes, I recognized her from her pictures in the society\r\nsection--the mayor\'s wife.\r\n\r\nSlim was apologizing. "I beg your pardon, Madam. 

=== Chunk 12 ===
It\'s quite all right.\r\nYour loveliness and radiant beauty just startled us. We--"\r\n\r\nWhile Slim was laying it on thick, the building inspector\'s car was\r\nexpanding. Now it became considerably too big for the stall and split\r\nit like a stick of dynamite going off in a shoe-box. It split it into a\r\nthousand pieces and then stood there, a passenger car seven feet tall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The mayor\'s wife gasped as she saw the tiny car.]\r\n\r\nThe mayor\'s wife gave a little scream of delight. Slim gave a horrified\r\ngasp. I tried to faint.\r\n\r\n"Oh," she said, "such a big car!"\r\n\r\nSlim moaned. "Please, Madam, will you leave now?"\r\n\r\nShe looked hurt again. "Yes, but will you please put this package in my\r\ncar?"\r\n\r\n"I will," said Slim, through tight jaws. "But--"\r\n\r\n"Why, that looks just like the building inspector\'s car," she said,\r\nwide-eyed. "It\'s his number, too."\r\n\r\n"Madam," begged Slim, "you\'re no dummy; please leave now and let us get\r\non with our work."\r\n\r\nShe walked upstairs dubiously. Slim was studying the enormous car with\r\na hopeless look on his face. Orders for cars to be taken out were\r\npouring down the chute.\r\n\r\n"What are we going to do now? We can\'t run that car into the other\r\nstall, because it\'s too big. It will take all night to build another\r\nstall, and no doubt the inspector is waiting up there with a squad of\r\ncops, hoping something will happen. After all, we\'re costing LaBombard\r\na million bucks." His eyes opened suddenly. 

=== Chunk 13 ===
"I\'ll bet he sent the woman\r\ndown here to spy on us."\r\n\r\nA car came down the ramp and went into the reducing stall, and Slim\r\nautomatically set the dial.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe telephone rang, and I could hear the voice from where I stood.\r\n"The building inspector wants his car."\r\n\r\n"Coming right up," Slim said.\r\n\r\nThen he looked at me. I looked at him. "Get that safe open," he jerked\r\nout. I dived for it.\r\n\r\nI was spinning the combination when I heard the voices. The building\r\ninspector was riding the ramp down to the basement. Then I heard more\r\nvoices and saw the bottom half of two cops and Richard LaBombard on the\r\nfreight elevator.\r\n\r\nSlim hissed to me. "Make it snappy!"\r\n\r\nI was trying to, but I couldn\'t get the thing open. Five thousand\r\ndollars in that safe and I couldn\'t get it. I spun the dial frantically\r\nand started over.\r\n\r\nBut now the ramp was filled with people. The cops were getting off the\r\nelevator. I jumped up and ran over to where Steve was standing.\r\n\r\nThe building inspector was staring bug-eyed at his huge car. Somebody\r\nwent around the stall and saw the six-inch car crawling out. Somebody\r\nelse took hold of the stall and shook it. "Where\'s my car? What\'s going\r\non?"\r\n\r\nWell, a mob is a funny thing. In about half a minute there were eight\r\nhundred people in that basement, and all of them tearing apart the\r\nreducing stall.\r\n\r\nSlim and I hesitated no longer. We ran up the stairway and sifted out\r\nthrough the crowd....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt three o\'clock in the morning Slim said to me, "You think that\r\nbrakeman will kick us off?"\r\n\r\nThe brakeman came to us, sitting up there in the fresh night breeze on\r\ntop of a carload of lettuce going east from California. He looked at\r\nme and then, as if he didn\'t believe it, he held his lantern up and\r\nexamined my head all the way around.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you go back to the farm? This ain\'t no life for you," he\r\ngrowled.\r\n\r\n"I am considering that very seriously," I said with as much dignity as\r\nI could.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE END\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
