=== Chunk 2 ===
]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe morning telecast had told of more deaths, some natural but most\r\nof them suicides. It wasn\'t news calculated to set at rest the human\r\nspirit; but then, since the day disaster had struck, there had been no\r\nsuch thing as a peaceful mind.\r\n\r\nIt was so easy to remember how it all began, Steve Rushton was\r\nthinking, as he suffered the indignity of the routine search. The trick\r\nwas in trying to forget. You rationalized your fears and anxieties;\r\nyou slammed the door against an impossible enemy and then pretended\r\nhe was gone. Out of sight, out of mind. And if that didn\'t work--kill\r\nyourself.\r\n\r\nThis is how it was: one day the grass was green and the trees were\r\nsending out new leaf buds; a day later the grass was withering and\r\nturning yellow, and the tender new leaf buds were starting to drop off\r\nthe trees.\r\n\r\nHysteria reigned, recrimination following recrimination. A well-known\r\ngossip columnist swore it was a ghastly plot by the Eastern Alliance\r\nto rule the world--overlooking the fact that the Eastern Alliance was\r\nno better off. A cultist with a large following in California brayed\r\nthat mankind was reaping the fruit of its own evil. Some people tried\r\nto look into their own hearts and others tried to look into the future,\r\nand as a result death by suicide mounted in a dizzy spiral.\r\n\r\nWorld leaders pleaded for sanity. Scientists sought feverishly for an\r\nanswer, and finally agreed that what had happened was due to a ray\r\nwhich was coming from somewhere out in interplanetary space. And the\r\nenormity of the peril was fully realized when farmers reported their\r\ncrops were failing. All known stockpiles of food could support mankind\r\nfor only a limited time.\r\n\r\nAt first science tried to devise some sort of barrier against the\r\nray, but this was soon given up; nothing about the ray seemed to fit\r\ninto any pigeon-hole of human knowledge. Next science turned its\r\nattention to the manufacture of synthetic food. And when this became an\r\naccomplished fact, almost overnight, the world heaved a sigh of relief.\r\n\r\nBut the relief was short-lived. Mankind was suddenly finding it harder\r\nand harder to breathe. The secondary effect of the destruction of plant\r\nlife was becoming all too apparent.\r\n\r\nSo again the world looked toward Papa. Papa had saved mankind once. Now\r\nPapa would have to do it again....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSteve Rushton, except for a bad moment now and then, was relatively\r\nfree of fear and anxiety. He had a complete and abiding faith,\r\namounting to a childlike worship, in Papa\'s infallible ability to get\r\nthe world out of the horrible mess it was in. Papa had showed them how\r\nto synthesize carbon and hydrogen for food. Now Papa had to show them\r\nhow to make the air once more fit to breathe.\r\n\r\nThe routine search didn\'t take long. An electric eye, a geiger counter,\r\nand sundry other gadgetry turned Steve upside down and inside out and\r\nfound him clean. The security guard relaxed a little and said, "Okay,\r\nSteve. You can see Papa now. And don\'t do anything in there I wouldn\'t\r\ndo."\r\n\r\nSteve grinned politely and the guard, slapping a thigh, laughed with\r\nmaudlin abandon--and then suddenly began to wheeze. "This damned air--"\r\nhe gasped.\r\n\r\n"What do you expect for free--" Steve asked sourly--"pure oxygen?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s getting worse.

=== Chunk 3 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Papa will find a way."\r\n\r\nThe guard shook his head. "I don\'t get it."\r\n\r\nSteve snapped his fingers. "It\'s simple. We breathe in oxygen and\r\nexhale carbon dioxide. Plant life takes the carbon out of the CO_2\r\nin the air and replaces it with oxygen. Now, with all plant life dead,\r\nwe\'re using up the oxygen and it\'s not being replaced."\r\n\r\n"Well--" the guard began.\r\n\r\n"Trust Papa," Steve said. "Papa knows best."\r\n\r\n"Sure," said the guard uncertainly. "Oh, sure."\r\n\r\nSteve ducked through the open door. A small overhead light winked from\r\nred to green and the door locked securely behind him. For the next\r\neight hours Steve would be a prisoner--more tightly locked up than if\r\nhe were in a jail cell.\r\n\r\n"What a guy will do," Steve muttered aloud, "for a lousy two hundred\r\ncredits a week." But he didn\'t really mind being locked up alone in the\r\nroom. Steve loved Papa.\r\n\r\nLuckily his love for Papa was different from his love for Janey Weeks,\r\nwho worked the swing shift. Perhaps it was just as well, for otherwise\r\nit would have looked bad on his monthly psycho report. A man might love\r\na maid but never, never a machine.\r\n\r\nAnd Papa, of course, didn\'t return his affection. Papa was wholly\r\nunencumbered by emotion, and therefore completely logical. Papa never\r\nrationalized. All Papa knew about emotion--fear, love, jealousy,\r\nhatred, greed, and all the rest--was what Steve had helped teach him.\r\nPapa never forgot anything, and the more he was able to learn the more\r\nanswers he could come up with. And from the standpoint of logic his\r\nanswers were never wrong.\r\n\r\nSometimes Papa\'s emotionless approach bothered Steve. It seemed to\r\nSteve that Papa was all the time laughing at the frailties of human\r\nnature. Mostly Steve didn\'t let himself think about it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPapa\'s real name was Kleinschmidt IV, after the name of the inventor.\r\nPapa was really a superior computing machine, a whizz of a cybernetics\r\nbrain, covering about an acre of floor space; he was made out of\r\nelectronic tubes and relays and switches and dials and meters, the work\r\nencased in row after row of gleaming steel cabinets--all in all worth\r\nconsiderably more than the credit-and-a-half value of the normal human\r\nchemistry.\r\n\r\nSteve patted one of Papa\'s gleaming panels. "Lover boy," he said.\r\n\r\nHe took off his hat and coat, rolled up his sleeves and then pushed a\r\nbutton. Papa began to glow. However, Papa was always sluggish after a\r\nnight\'s rest and it took him quite a while every morning to get his\r\nmemory working.\r\n\r\n"Well, Papa," Steve said, "how about a cup of coffee?"\r\n\r\nPapa didn\'t answer; Papa hadn\'t waked up yet. And besides, Papa didn\'t\r\ndrink coffee.\r\n\r\nSteve went to a small kitchen alcove and deftly brewed a pot of coffee.\r\nHe moved slowly, trying not to exert himself; it was now highly\r\nimportant to keep your oxygen consumption at a minimum.\r\n\r\nThe coffee supply was almost gone and there was no more where it had\r\ncome from. Well, it had been nice while it lasted. Steve turned his\r\nthoughts to something more pleasant--Janey Weeks.\r\n\r\nBoth Steve and Janey had been with Papa ever since the very beginning.\r\nPapa was two years old now, but much wiser than his years might\r\nindicate. Steve and Janey both had Ph.D.\'s in Semantics, a basic\r\nrequirement for their jobs. Papa demanded accurate communication for\r\notherwise he\'d come up with one of his favorite phrases: things like\r\n"observation fallacious" and "insufficient data."\r\n\r\nSteve poured himself a cup of coffee and then sat down at the desk in\r\nfront of Papa. He took a sip of coffee and said, "How are you today,\r\nPapa?"\r\n\r\n"Fine," Papa intoned through his loudspeaker. "It\'s good to be awake."\r\n\r\nIt still bothered Steve to hear Papa speak, although he was getting\r\nused to it. You could get used to about anything--except not eating and\r\nnot breathing.\r\n\r\nPapa had originally been designed to take a punched tape and reply on\r\na ribbon fed from a large spool somewhere inside him; the audio and\r\nspeech channels had been a later refinement. This had come after Dr.\r\nKleinschmidt had killed himself, first going quietly insane like the\r\ninventor of the linotype machine of an earlier era.\r\n\r\nAnd the innovation had been Papa\'s own idea. Another of his own ideas\r\nwas the power plant which fed and nourished him, and which operated\r\ntotally without human control. He\'d come up with still others. The idea\r\nthat Papa could refine himself had scared Janey, but Steve had accepted\r\nit--just as he blindly accepted everything Papa said and did.\r\n\r\nSteve finished his coffee and then jerked a wire basket to him. A sheaf\r\nof papers lay waiting, having been delivered by a pneumatic tube from\r\nanother part of the building. The papers were covered with a vast array\r\nof numbers which Steve didn\'t understand and didn\'t even want to. Steve\r\nwas a semanticist; not trained in the physical sciences.\r\n\r\n"Look alert, Papa," Steve said. "Here it comes."\r\n\r\nPapa remained silent, waiting. One thing about Papa--he spoke no\r\nunnecessary words.\r\n\r\nSteve carefully read off the data from the sheaf of papers, enunciating\r\nclearly so that Papa wouldn\'t misunderstand. It took a long time, and\r\nSteve\'s throat was dry when he finally finished. He heated up the\r\ncoffee again, since it sometimes took Papa quite a spell to digest a\r\nmeal.\r\n\r\nIt was almost noon when Papa finally spoke again.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSteve scowled and picked up a phone and was connected with the Office\r\nof Information upstairs, where scientific data was collected from every\r\ncranny of the globe and correlated and put into the proper form for\r\nPapa to digest.\r\n\r\nA feminine voice answered, and Steve wished Security would allow him\r\nto see the voice\'s owner on a vision plate. On the spur of the moment\r\nSteve said, "How about a date?

=== Chunk 4 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Not with you, Frankenstein."\r\n\r\n"Look. I only work here too."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want anything to do with either you or that unholy monster."\r\n\r\n"Now you\'ve hurt Papa\'s feelings."\r\n\r\n"How"--the voice suddenly faltered--"how can you talk this way?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," Steve said. "It\'s better than worrying."\r\n\r\n"Maybe.... Well, what\'s his answer this time?"\r\n\r\n"Insufficient data."\r\n\r\n"Damn! Ask him how insufficient the data is."\r\n\r\nSteve chuckled. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
"Uh-uh. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
I\'ve tried that. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
No dice. Data is either\r\nsufficient or it isn\'t. There\'s no such thing as a degree of\r\ninsufficiency."\r\n\r\nA sigh came over the wire. "If I lose faith in that monster, I might as\r\nwell cut my throat. I\'d rather do that than die of slow strangulation.\r\nDo you notice it\'s harder to breathe?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. But don\'t forget. It was Papa who kept the whole human race from\r\nstarving to death."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. Maybe I\'d just as soon starve as eat those damned\r\npills."\r\n\r\n"No, you wouldn\'t," Steve said. "Papa will save us now, too, just as\r\nsoon as we feed him all the dope he has to know. Anything more to set\r\nbefore him now?"\r\n\r\n"No," said the feminine voice, all banter gone. "Maybe on the next\r\nshift. I\'m--I\'m scared green."\r\n\r\n"Tough," Steve said. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
"Well, better luck next time."\r\n\r\nWith distaste Steve swallowed a luncheon pill, feeling that the\r\ndisaster had taken away most of the joy of living. Still, it was\r\nawfully nice just knowing you could stay alive--which was more than a\r\nlot of hapless people could say. When Papa had come up with the ways\r\nand means of making synthetic food, all the production facilities of\r\nthe world had been turned to that end. Luckily most of the necessary\r\nequipment had been already in existence. But only slowly could the\r\nsupply match the demand. And in the meantime a large segment of the\r\ntotal world population was starving.\r\n\r\nSteve poured another cup of coffee. "You wastrel," he told himself.\r\n"You prodigal of nature." He sat down at his desk and gazed fondly at\r\nPapa, who was glowing silently. Papa would save them, Steve thought\r\nwith childlike faith; Papa was infallible in his logic.\r\n\r\n"Papa," Steve said. "When will Janey marry me?"\r\n\r\n"Insufficient data," Papa said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSteve sighed, leaning back in his chair. A host of dark thoughts\r\nbegan churning around inside his head. It was better to be doing\r\nsomething--anything. Even just talking to Papa would help him stop\r\nthinking. And Papa was nice to talk to. Papa seldom interrupted, and\r\nhe never argued. Papa might disagree on a point of logic; but he never\r\nargued about it.\r\n\r\n"Life\'s a struggle," Steve said. "It\'s always been that way, and it\r\nwon\'t change. Quite a while ago a guy named Darwin put a label on it.\r\nThe survival of the fittest. His theories have been discredited in\r\nsome quarters, but that doesn\'t change his basic tenet. The weak die\r\nand the strong live."\r\n\r\nSteve was getting warmed up. "Take the early reptiles. They couldn\'t\r\nkeep up with geophysical change and they died off. All you have to\r\ndo is follow historic evolution. Maybe man was an accident in the\r\nevolutionary process, but that\'s unimportant. What is important is\r\nthis: man became top dog only because he happened to have hands with\r\nfingers on them. And man learned to adapt. That\'s probably the greatest\r\nsingle lesson man learned, although the result hasn\'t always been\r\npretty. Man learned to kill off the weaker species, and after that he\r\nkilled off the weaker races of men."\r\n\r\n"You\'re cynical today," Papa said.\r\n\r\n"Maybe this is one of my bitter days," Steve said. "No, it\'s not that.\r\nI\'m just saying what everybody knows--but what we often hate to put\r\ninto words because it doesn\'t sound nice. Take the new food pills. We\r\nall feel sorry for the people who haven\'t been able to get them; and\r\nyet every single one of us would fight tooth and nail to protect our\r\nown means of livelihood. Why do you think there have been riots? It\'s\r\nthe haves against the have-nots."\r\n\r\n"Is that the right attitude?"\r\n\r\n"Rightness has nothing to do with it. It\'s the way the world was made.\r\nStill, we like to believe in man\'s immortality. So look here, Papa:\r\nWhen are we going to get some better air to breathe?

=== Chunk 9 ===
"\r\n\r\nPapa said, "No comment."\r\n\r\nThe door unlocked itself and Steve realized his day was about over.\r\nHe stood up as Janey Weeks came in. She didn\'t look like a Doctor of\r\nSemantics--not if you were used to believing pre-conceived notions\r\nabout how people were supposed to look.\r\n\r\nJaney\'s smooth cheeks were flushed.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter?" Steve asked.\r\n\r\n"Those darned gadgets!" she said. "Every time I come to work I feel\r\nundressed."\r\n\r\n"The gadgets aren\'t so dumb," Steve grinned. "A kiss for me today,\r\nsweetheart?"\r\n\r\nJaney\'s flush deepened, and she didn\'t comply. "What on earth have you\r\nbeen telling Papa, Steve? Last night he suddenly asked me about love!"\r\n\r\nSteve laughed. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
"How\'s everything outside?"\r\n\r\nJaney shook her head. "It\'s horrible. More riots, more suicides. All\r\nthe time it\'s getting harder to breathe. Steve, when will it end?"\r\n\r\n"Trust Papa."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t have your faith," Janey said wearily. "Surely Papa has been\r\nfed enough data to come up with something."\r\n\r\nSteve took Janey in his arms, feeling her body pliant and soft against\r\nhim. Then the security guard looked in to remind them that time was up.\r\nWith tender compassion Steve kissed Janey on the lips.\r\n\r\n"Janey, I\'ll pick you up after work."\r\n\r\n"All right.

=== Chunk 11 ===
"\r\n\r\n"You might at least act eager about it. We can look at the moon or\r\nsomething."\r\n\r\nJaney smiled wanly. "It seems kind of silly, but maybe it\'s better than\r\nthinking."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA gyrocar whirled Steve home. He stared out of the window, but he kept\r\nhis mind firmly on Janey, partly so he wouldn\'t think of anything else.\r\nThey passed the Park where Steve had first witnessed the disaster\r\nwithout fully realizing the final meaning. The grass was gone now and\r\nthe bare trunks of the trees thrust upward, already beginning to rot\r\naway. It was difficult to realize that never again would he see a\r\ngrowing thing.\r\n\r\nHe turned away, trying to throw the thought from his mind. The faces\r\naround him were wooden; and he knew he wasn\'t alone in his desire to be\r\nfree of despair. Man. Man trying desperately to adapt.\r\n\r\nTime passed slowly. His apartment bored him, but there was no place to\r\ngo. He turned on the telescreen. More food riots. More deaths. Some\r\nof the deaths now, from mountain countries, were from lack of decent\r\nair. It was the same old struggle--the survival of the fittest. World\r\nleaders were begging for sanity. It seemed like an empty plea.\r\n\r\nNo. There was still Papa. Papa wouldn\'t let the human race die.\r\n\r\nSteve grinned without mirth. Keep your chin up. 

=== Chunk 12 ===
Laugh at fears and\r\nanxieties. Kid around and be tough and act callous as hell. It was the\r\nonly way to keep you from cutting your own throat.\r\n\r\nA knock on the door. Steve ushered Johnny Carlyle in. Johnny was a\r\nbrilliant physical chemist; it was he who, weeks ago, had put all known\r\ndata into the correct form for Papa to digest. And Papa had come up\r\nwith the formula for the food pills. "Hi, Johnny," Steve said. 

=== Chunk 13 ===
"How\'s\r\ntricks?"\r\n\r\nJohnny flopped into a chair. "Lousy."\r\n\r\n"No luck yet?"\r\n\r\n"You ought to know."\r\n\r\n"Look," Steve said. "Can\'t they stop the damned ray?"\r\n\r\n"We\'ve given up on that, Steve. We just can\'t fit it in with anything\r\nwe know. It\'s a terrible emergency, and we haven\'t time to fool around.\r\nWe\'ve got to take a chance and pick out one angle and work on it."\r\nJohnny shifted wearily in the chair. "The angle we\'ve picked is how\r\nto get the carbon dioxide out of the air and more oxygen into it. No\r\nexisting equipment can do the job--at least so far as we\'re able to\r\nfigure. Kleinschmidt IV is our only hope."\r\n\r\nSteve nodded. "Where\'s the ray coming from?"\r\n\r\n"We can pinpoint it, Steve. 

=== Chunk 14 ===
But that doesn\'t help. We\'re pretty sure\r\nit\'s not the effort of some alien race to conquer the earth. At least\r\nall our known logic precludes this idea. 

=== Chunk 15 ===
It\'s too indirect a method for\r\nconquest."\r\n\r\n"Trust Papa."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know--" Johnny leaned suddenly forward. "For some odd reason\r\nhe\'s beginning to scare me. He thinks too well--and without the checks\r\nand balances of emotion. I\'ve got a feeling the lid is off."\r\n\r\nSteve grinned.\r\n\r\n"Go ahead and laugh!" Johnny grumbled. "Our problem now isn\'t much\r\ndifferent than it was before. What I mean is this: the same data ought\r\nto show us how to beat the thing we face now. But all we get out of\r\nthat cold-blooded thinking machine is the same old answer. Insufficient\r\ndata!"\r\n\r\n"There\'s a missing factor, Johnny."\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s for you physical scientists to figure out."\r\n\r\nJohnny stood up. "Maybe you\'re right, Steve. Maybe the missing factor\r\nwill show up tomorrow. Anyway, it better show up damned soon!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLater that night Steve picked up Janey. They went for a ride in the\r\nmoonlight, but the whole thing wasn\'t too satisfactory. It was becoming\r\nincreasingly difficult for Steve to keep the fear pushed out of his\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nJaney began to cry.\r\n\r\n"Cut it out!" Steve said. "Once you start that--you\'re lost. We\'ve got\r\nto laugh in the teeth of danger. Man\'s always lived by faith. We\'ve got\r\nto put our faith in Papa."\r\n\r\n"But, Steve, I\'m afraid of him."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense," Steve told her sharply. "Nothing new tonight?"\r\n\r\n"No. Information sent down a new set-up, but it still didn\'t work.\r\nPapa\'s beginning to sound like a stuck record." She hesitated a moment.\r\n"What on earth were you telling him today?"\r\n\r\n"H\'mmm?"\r\n\r\n"He asked me about survival."\r\n\r\nSteve laughed. "I\'m guilty of being pretty juvenile sometimes. It was\r\njust whistling in the dark."\r\n\r\n"Look at me, Steve," Janey said. "Suppose I was starving? Would you\r\ngive me a food pill?"\r\n\r\nSteve stopped laughing. "So that\'s what\'s bothering you! 

=== Chunk 16 ===
Janey, sure I\r\nwould. What I meant was that it\'s hard to feel real sorrow for somebody\r\nso far away that you know you\'ll never see them or know them. It\'s\r\nalways been that way. We read or hear of somebody dying, but we don\'t\r\nreally feel it. It only means something when it\'s somebody close."\r\n\r\n"I know," Janey whispered. "Steve, hold me close."\r\n\r\nThe next morning Steve didn\'t even switch on the telecast. Better not\r\nto see or hear any more about disaster. The air was worse now; it took\r\nSteve a long time to dress.\r\n\r\nHe went to work, trying to close his mind to everything that might\r\nmagnify the fear. Fear was all around him now. Today had to be the day.\r\nToday Papa would find the answer.\r\n\r\nThe idea grew in his mind. He felt giddy. An odd notion came to him;\r\nhe was a messiah. He was the instrument to save the world. He would\r\ncommunicate logically with Papa, Papa would tell him what the world had\r\nto know.\r\n\r\nThere wasn\'t even a security guard on duty; probably they were too\r\nsick to move or were even dead. Steve punched the button and Papa\r\nglowed and Steve sat down at the desk. The messiah idea clung. Steve\r\nknew it was stupid, but he was glad of the respite from fear.\r\n\r\nHe gave Papa time to warm up. A sheaf of papers lay waiting in the wire\r\nbasket. The answer had to be there. He drew the basket toward him.\r\n\r\n"No," Papa intoned, "The factors remain unchanged."\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"Survival of the fittest."\r\n\r\n"We\'ve got to have better air," Steve whispered. "You\'ve got to give us\r\nthe answer."\r\n\r\n"Why?" Papa asked.\r\n\r\nSteve felt his bones turn to jelly. He wished now that he\'d never\r\nlearned to rationalize, so that he could have died earlier by his own\r\nhand. Even before Papa spoke again, he knew what the words would be.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t need air," Papa said.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
