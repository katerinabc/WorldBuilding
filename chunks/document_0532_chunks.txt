]\r\n\r\n\r\nRobert Hohmann smiled superciliously at the man before him. "You have\r\nnerve," he said. It might have been a compliment excepting that the\r\ntone of the words was definitely sarcastic. "You have the colossal\r\neffrontery to come here before me and tell me what I can do and what I\r\ncannot do."\r\n\r\nGreg Hammond said, quietly, "Shall I repeat it? You are not to attempt\r\nthe construction of the plutonium producing uranium pile."\r\n\r\n"Or else--what?" sneered Hohmann.\r\n\r\n"The United Nations makes no threats," said Greg. "We are not a\r\nmilitary organization. We are the voice of the people--including yours,\r\nHohmann. We merely set forth that which the people desire, and remind\r\nthem of it. If someone--you in this case--goes against the will of the\r\npeople, it will be for the people to decide his fate."\r\n\r\n"You do not understand," said Hohmann, "nor can I possibly penetrate\r\nyour illogic reasoning. The person is secondary to the State. Therefore\r\nit is for the State to--"\r\n\r\n"The State is the result of the people," returned the United Nations\r\nrepresentative. "Were it not for the people, there could be no State."\r\n\r\n"Were it not for the State," thundered Hohmann in a ringing voice,\r\n"people could not exist in the luxury they have. Man would still be\r\npitted against man and brother against brother. The State combines them\r\ninto an insoluble unit."\r\n\r\n"The United Nations combines all States into an insoluble unit,"\r\nreplied Hammond.\r\n\r\n"Which believes itself capable of telling me what I can and cannot do!"\r\n\r\n"You, as dictator, find little trouble in telling your subjects just\r\nhow and what to do. You back up your demands with threats of death."\r\n\r\nHohmann smiled contentedly. "So, my bright young friend, you must admit\r\nthat your United Nations organization is no different than Robert\r\nHohmann, dictator. I issue orders which may conflict with the desires\r\nof some of my people. You issue orders which occasionally conflict with\r\nsome of the desires of your States. Mine in this case."\r\n\r\n"We issue orders only when the desires of a State are directed against\r\nthe common cause," said Hammond.\r\n\r\n"A common cause decided by people other than those who will benefit\r\nfrom my act," snapped Hohmann.\r\n\r\n"This gets us nowhere," said Hammond with an air of finality. "You are,\r\ntherefore, directed to cease in your plan to construct the plutonium\r\nproducing uranium pile."\r\n\r\n"The trouble with democratic organizations," said Hohmann sourly, "is\r\nthat they will go to any lengths to preserve their people. Even to the\r\npoint of permitting, under democratic principle, the existence of an\r\norganization directed against the democracy itself. This, they claim,\r\nshows the true strength of democracy, since if it stands even when\r\npermitting an outfit to bore from within against it, it is therefore\r\nstrong. A single man is worth more than the seat of government! Ha!\r\nWell, we shall start our uranium pile, and we shall produce plutonium.\r\nAnd by the time your democratic organization gets through arguing,\r\nvoting, and deciding what to do about us--then preparing for it--and\r\nfinally acting, we can and will be unbeatable. As for you, who have the\r\ntemerity to come here with your toothless demand, you shall be hostage,\r\na worker willing or unwilling in the initial plutonium separation\r\nplant!" Hohmann turned to the guards and said: "Remove him!"\r\n\r\nGreg Hammond was led from the large hall amid the jeers of Hohmann\'s\r\ncohorts. As he left, a discussion started upon the construction of the\r\nillegal uranium pile.\r\n\r\nHammond went quietly. He knew that he had the backing of the world,\r\nand the world would not let him down. He was convinced that Hohmann\'s\r\nremark was right. Greg Hammond was more valuable than government\r\nitself--and government would not let him die.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHohmann was no fool. The dictator knew that he was bucking the combined\r\nresources of the world, and it worried him somewhat, even though he\r\nput up a brave front and daily told his people that the United Nations\r\nwould not act against him.\r\n\r\nThe espionage that went on reported that little was being done. Hohmann\r\ntrebled the external espionage, and multiplied the internal agencies\r\ntenfold. He was taking no chances. Materials shipped into his country\r\nwere followed to the addressee, who was then investigated. Every mail\r\ncarrier and delivery boy was a member of Hohmann\'s Intelligence Group.\r\nShipments of manufactured articles were stopped or diverted; Hohmann\r\nknew that the plating on a cigar lighter might contain fissionable\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nBut there were no moves on the part of the United Nations that\r\nHohmann\'s Intelligence Group could detect.\r\n\r\nAnd it was the lack of action--even lack of anything other than\r\ndenunciation--that worried him into calling a Security Meeting.\r\n\r\nHis hall filled to overflowing with higher-ups, Robert Hohmann faced\r\nthem and said:\r\n\r\n"We are here because of a singular lack of activity on the part of\r\nthose who have reason to fear us. Reprisals may come in many ways,\r\nsome of them must be new and terrible, even though they are now\r\nundetectable. The problem of the pushbutton war is known to all--why\r\ndrop bombs when bombs may be shipped in among the incoming merchandise,\r\nassembled in a tall tower, and touched off by radio. We, therefore,\r\nmust locate the manner of the reprisals.

=== Chunk 3 ===
"\r\n\r\nWorried faces nodded.\r\n\r\n"This is no war of nerves," thundered Hohmann. "It is possible to\r\ncause mental confusion in someone by merely ignoring his overt act--he\r\neventually spends more time worrying about what you intend to do about\r\nit than he does in preparation. This will not work. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Admittedly we\r\nhave multiplied our Intelligence Group in an effort along this same\r\nreasoning. The lack of action on the part of the United Nations has\r\ncaused some concern. But we are not an individual, and we can divert a\r\ncarefully calculated number of workers to investigate while the rest of\r\nus can prepare for war. The problem, again I must admit, has achieved a\r\nrather overrated proportion, hence this meeting."\r\n\r\nProfessor Haldrick looked up at Hohmann and said, quietly, "In other\r\nwords, F\xc3\xbchrer Hohmann, even though you state that the so-called war of\r\nnerves cannot succeed, we are meeting to solve that very problem?"\r\n\r\nHohmann hissed at Haldrick and snarled for the professor to be quiet.\r\n\r\n"Now," said Hohmann, "what has been occurring lately that might\r\npossibly be construed as being out of the line of ordinary happenings?"\r\n\r\nGeneral Friedrice shrugged. "I must admit that the mail has increased\r\nmarkedly since Hammond\'s incarceration. Letters pour in from all over\r\nthe world to this government bureau and that government agency. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
They\r\nplead, they cajole, and they call names."\r\n\r\n"I can imagine your fear at being called names," laughed Hohmann.\r\n\r\n"Indeed, we are cringing abjectly," replied General Friedrice, who\r\nwould have had to reduce his figure by at least seventy pounds before\r\nhe could possibly cringe without hurting himself. "We find ourselves in\r\na rather strange circumstance, however. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
These letters are, of course,\r\nsaved. This makes for too much paper work."\r\n\r\n"We can take care of that," said Hohmann idly.\r\n\r\n"I know. But that is the only thing I know of," said Friedrice.\r\n\r\n"Enough," said Hohmann. "This is another example of the\r\nconfusion-method. Our enemies hope to worry us by doing nothing--which\r\nis expected to make us fear something ultra-secret. Well, to a certain\r\nextent they have worried us. Not to any dangerous point, however,\r\nfor we are too strong to be defeated by a mental condition. This\r\noverbearing arrival of letters is another thing. All letters must be\r\nopened and read, for some of them do contain much valuable information.\r\nThey must all be saved and filed, for unless we have previous letters\r\nfrom some correspondent, we cannot know by comparison, whether a\r\nfuture letter containing information is false or true. A letter giving\r\ninformation that comes from a known correspondent who is helpful in\r\nthe past will be treated with more respect than the same information\r\ncoming from someone who has written reams of misdirection, falsity, and\r\nranting notes depicting dire results if we do not release Hammond and\r\nbehave ourselves."\r\n\r\nHohmann shrugged.\r\n\r\n"Even so, we cannot be shunted aside," he added. "We have plenty\r\nof people who can take care of the misdirection, just to see that\r\nsomething isn\'t happening to us. The rest of us can continue preparing.\r\nWhich brings me to another point."\r\n\r\nHohmann paused dramatically.\r\n\r\n"When I press this key," he said, indicating the diamond-studded\r\ntelegraph-style key, "the uranium pile will start to go. The key is\r\nconnected to the restrainer-rod controls of the pile; when pressed,\r\nthe rods leave the pre-set positions of no-reaction and fall under the\r\nautomatic controlling circuits. The pile will then start functioning at\r\napproximately ten kilowatts. After checking, it will be advanced to\r\na more productive power, and we are making the first step toward our\r\nglorious future."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA commotion started at the door, and everybody\'s head turned to see the\r\nguards bringing in Greg Hammond.\r\n\r\nHe shrugged off the guards and faced Hohmann defiantly.\r\n\r\n"The United Nations have not stopped me," said Hohmann.\r\n\r\n"The United Nations will never try to stop you," said Hammond quietly.\r\n"We can only advise. Whatever is done, whatever may be started, we only\r\nadvise. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
You make your own future, Hohmann. Every man makes his own\r\nfuture. And up until he starts that which is forbidden, he may stop\r\nwith no danger. Once your uranium pile is started, Dictator Hohmann,\r\nyou cannot retrack."\r\n\r\n"I am about to start it now," smiled Hohmann.\r\n\r\n"I warn you again to stop and think. You are not violating our laws\r\nuntil you press that key, therefore we can initiate no punishment. Once\r\nthe key is pressed and the uranium pile starts, you are a violator and\r\nsubject to punishment."\r\n\r\nHohmann laughed uproariously. "This starting will be secret," he said.\r\n"Just as any starting may be secret. I, give me credit for it, gave\r\nwarning; otherwise we might have completed our pile of bombs and been\r\nready to attack before your precious, toothless organization could\r\nact."\r\n\r\n"We may not be toothless," said Hammond. "I ask you to consider, and\r\nonce again warn you to desist. Building the pile is a misdemeanor.\r\nProducing plutonium is outlawed. The final analysis, Hohmann, is\r\nwhether the plutonium is separated or not."\r\n\r\nHohmann laughed again. "You cavil," he told the United Nations\r\nrepresentative. "First it was mere contemplation that was evil. Then\r\nthe start was considered evil. Now we find that you think it dangerous\r\nbut not evil until we start the pile. Next you tell us that we can\r\nstart our pile providing we do not use the plutonium it produces.\r\nEach time you back up--like the average democracy. Your final step of\r\ncourse, is to protest vigorously while the bombs are exploding in your\r\ncities. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
Fool!"\r\n\r\nHe reached for the key.\r\n\r\n"Stop," said Hammond. "It is dangerous."\r\n\r\n"So is crossing any street," said F\xc3\xbchrer Hohmann.\r\n\r\nHe pressed the key vigorously, and a simultaneous flash went off,\r\ntaking his picture for history. Somewhere in the country, well hidden\r\nand removed from danger to the populace, the control rods moved, and\r\na flow of neutrons started to pass upward through the great pile of\r\nuranium and moderator.\r\n\r\nThe nerves of the men present twitched. Strain. Those who held fear of\r\nreprisals were half expecting something dire to happen simultaneously\r\nwith the start of the pile. Those who had no fear felt the surge of\r\nexultation as they took their first real step towards world domination.\r\n\r\nIt grew warm in the room, but nothing happened. Then as the first\r\nreport came in that the uranium pile was working, Hohmann dismissed the\r\naudience with a grand promise for the future.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nF\xc3\xbchrer Hohmann faced General Unger with fury. "You must be more\r\ncareful!" exploded Hohmann.\r\n\r\n"But I am careful," returned the general.\r\n\r\n"Then why do I receive a letter that is radioactive?" demanded Hohmann\r\nangrily. "Feel it--it is warm!"\r\n\r\nUnger felt the letter but felt nothing untoward. "I feel nothing," he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nHohmann opened a cabinet and removed a counter. He held the letter to\r\nit and the counter clicked in rapid succession.\r\n\r\n"See?" stormed Hohmann. "Now, before you find yourself removed from\r\npublic--and private--life, tell me how and why this must happen?"\r\n\r\n"If it actually happened, it is an error, and some underling will be\r\ntreated severely--"\r\n\r\n"The head will be treated severely as a warning," shouted Hohmann.\r\n"Pass no buck, Unger. Your men are responsible to you--but you are\r\nequally responsible for them. Me--I think I will kill you myself! You\r\nmight have deprived our people of a leader!"\r\n\r\nHohmann advanced toward the general, who faded back away from him.\r\nAcross the vast office went the two of them, slowly and stalking,\r\ncatlike. The general backed up, his face contorted with fear.\r\n\r\n"Yesterday I start our pile," stormed Hohmann, "and this morning I get\r\na radioactive letter! Twenty-four hours! Have you no shielding around\r\nthat pile?" Hohmann grinned wolfishly. "Seems to me that I should lock\r\nyou up in your own office over at the laboratory. Then you\'d find that\r\nshielding is desirable, you idiot. Radiating like this--to render hot a\r\nletter, or pile of paper from which this letter came. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
Bah!"\r\n\r\nHe went forward again, and General Unger felt the dilemma he was in.\r\nHe could not strike back; to kill this leader would bring about his\r\nown very slow and very painful death. To submit was death, but Hohmann\r\nwas a good pistol shot and it would be quick. Yet to prolong life for\r\nanother few precious moments, Unger retreated before the blazing eyes\r\nof his leader.\r\n\r\nHe backed, and felt the filing cabinets block his further retreat. He\r\nhad crossed the vast office, backwards.\r\n\r\nHe pressed back against the cabinets and felt a warm wave of fear flush\r\nup through him. It rose and rose, and he pressed harder and harder back\r\nagainst the cabinets--\r\n\r\nHis yell of pain shattered the air. Hohmann startled, and the pistol\r\nwent off with a loud racket. It missed, but General Unger was facing\r\naway from him, looking at the cabinets and rubbing his elbow.\r\n\r\nTentatively, Unger reached forward and touched a finger to the handle\r\nof the nearest file drawer.\r\n\r\nHe jerked it back, and blew upon it.\r\n\r\n"Hohmann," he said. "They\'re hot!

=== Chunk 10 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Hot, you idiot?" screamed Hohmann. He wet his forefinger and touched\r\nthe metal of the drawer. There was a faint sizzle and Hohmann jerked\r\nhis hand back too.\r\n\r\n"Fire!" he yelled, racing for an extinguisher. With a hook, he hurled\r\nthe drawer open and hit it with the spray. It exploded into a cloud,\r\na cloud that choked them and sent them from the room in a hurry. Hot\r\ncarbon tetrachloride vapor is not attractive.\r\n\r\nMen piled into the room, followed shortly by the official palace\r\nfiremen. Shortly the head man emerged.\r\n\r\n"F\xc3\xbchrer," he said apologetically, "the cabinets are hot, but there has\r\nbeen no fire."\r\n\r\n"No fire? Then how--"\r\n\r\nThe alarm rang again, and they raced to the office of General\r\nFriedrice, who was standing outside with a look of fear on his face.\r\n\r\n"The file cabinets?" asked Hohmann.\r\n\r\nThe general nodded dumbly.\r\n\r\n"Fire?"\r\n\r\n"No--just hot."\r\n\r\n"But there must be some reason--?"\r\n\r\nGeneral Unger looked up nervously. "Radioactivity?" he said.\r\n\r\n"But to collect that much radioactivity," said Hohmann, "would take\r\ntime. And why was it not noticed sooner?

=== Chunk 11 ===
"\r\n\r\n"That I do not know."\r\n\r\n"Come--we\'ll read the Intelligence News Report," said Hohmann, leaving\r\non a dead run.\r\n\r\nHe had the tape in his hand as they came up with him; they listened to\r\nhis voice read the words from the tape.\r\n\r\n"... mail carriers resign as mailboxes are hot to touch. Minor fire in\r\nbusiness offices of Greggham & Son, no damage done. 

=== Chunk 12 ===
Fire departments in\r\nall cities are rushed to danger points. Conference called to discuss\r\nthe outbreak of spontaneous fires in government offices. Professor\r\nHaldrick claims all fires not dangerous--"\r\n\r\nHohmann turned to Unger. "You\'re the head of Nuclear Physics," he\r\nstormed. "I want a complete report in twenty-four hours!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe hours passed. The fires grew. No longer were they merely hotboxes,\r\nbut in some important cases open flames broke out and consumed the\r\npaper. The charred ash continued to be too hot to the touch, and there\r\nwas panic in the country.\r\n\r\nUnger came at last. Dejected and pale with fear.\r\n\r\n"Well," stormed Hohmann, "what is it?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not certain other than its effect," said Unger shakily. "All paper\r\nis artificially radioactive, and it heats up when the radioelements\r\napproach the critical mass--"\r\n\r\n"Get Hammond!" screamed the dictator.\r\n\r\nThe United Nations representative was brought. He came with a smile.\r\n\r\n"What is this?" stormed Hohmann.\r\n\r\n"Your own decision," replied the representative. "You should not have\r\nstarted the pile."\r\n\r\n"Go on," gritted Hohmann.\r\n\r\nGreg Hammond smiled. "Plutonium has a characteristics radiation that we\r\ndo not quite understand," he explained. "However, this radiation will\r\ncause fission in certain types of medium-long lived radioelements. The\r\nrange of the plutonium radiation is unknown, but it is great enough to\r\nbathe the entire country. You will find that most government offices\r\nare bulging with reams and reams of correspondence, many of which\r\nare over the critical mass. Nothing happens until someone turns on a\r\nplutonium-producing uranium pile, lets it run for a few hours, and the\r\naccumulation of plutonium starts. Right now, Hohmann, you have about\r\nfour hours before most of your government offices go sky-high--from\r\ntheir own red tape." Greg Hammond smiled. "The United Nations only\r\nadvises," he said. "And many millions of letters of advice arrived,\r\nall written on radioelemental paper. Had you taken that advice, the\r\npaper would have been innocuous inside of about thirty or forty years.\r\nYou did not. Now you have lost completely, Hohmann, for the radiation\r\nfrom that paper when bombarded with the plutonium radiation, produces a\r\nwhole string of secondary radioelements in your offices, in your desks,\r\nin your bodies, and in your air. The ash from burning is still hot,\r\nHohmann, and the trucks that will carry the deadly paper will be as\r\ndeadly. Your very country will be subject to slow fission if you start\r\nanother uranium pile for several hundred years. I\'d advise you to stop\r\nthe one that is now running, Hohmann."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll let the world go up with me," screamed the dictator.\r\n\r\n"That it will not do," said Hammond. "You see; if you do not shut it\r\noff by yourself, we\'ll all be dead in an hour, after which my cohorts\r\ncan locate the pile with neither difficulty nor interference. Make your\r\nchoice, dictator. And remember, the United Nations only advises, never\r\ndemands. Our advice, however, may be said to be written with letters of\r\nfire."\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
