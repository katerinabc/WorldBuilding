He had been taking his usual two-hour, after-lunch nap, but\r\ntoday it had brought him little refreshment. Earlier he had received an\r\nunexpected report that made sleep impossible.\r\n\r\n"John?" he mumbled.\r\n\r\nJohn Claxson, the generously padded assistant division chief, stopped\r\ndrilling out his earwax but did not remove his feet from the blotter of\r\nhis desk. "Yeah, Chief?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve heard from the Kentons again."\r\n\r\n"I thought something was deviling you, the way you was carrying on in\r\nyour sleep." He raised thick eyebrows. "Is their production down again?"\r\n\r\n"Worse than that, John. Kenton has had the gall to request time off to\r\nbuild a new house!"\r\n\r\n"No! I can\'t believe it.

=== Chunk 3 ===
"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t either, John. They know it\'s not in the Manual."\r\n\r\n"Certainly it\'s not, Chief. The nerve of those people wanting to do\r\nsomething that\'s not in the Manual!"\r\n\r\n"People like us wrote the Manual, John," the Chief added with simple\r\nmodesty. "That is why it is so good, good, good."\r\n\r\n"I know," said John, accepting the weight. Then he complained bitterly,\r\n"Wanting to build a new house! They are supposed to do personal stuff\r\nat night, or when it\'s raining."\r\n\r\nThe Chief allowed his rage to climb. "They\'ve got nothing to do but go\r\nout into the jungle and pick a little old bale of pretzins every day,\r\nbut do you think they are going to do it? No. They want _me_ to go and\r\ndo it for them!"\r\n\r\n"You can\'t _do_ it, Chief!" protested John.\r\n\r\n"You know I can\'t, John," agreed Wattles as he stretched. "I got all I\r\ncan manage right here.

More."\r\n\r\n"What you got to do, Chief?" John asked curiously, forgetting caution\r\nfor a moment.\r\n\r\n"Plenty!" retorted the Chief.\r\n\r\n"I guess you have at that," John admitted, getting back aboard.\r\n\r\n"Time was," brooded the Chief, "when that Kenton was a fair pretzin\r\nfinder. But all he can think of to do now is to find excuses to\r\ngoldbrick. Wait until he sees the stiff memorandum I\'m sending him...."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBliss Kenton had not gone far from their Venusian jungle cabin\r\nthat morning before the vacuum snake hung one on her. The thick,\r\ntwo-foot-long pest lay very still on the ground, and she only got a\r\nglimpse of it before it jumped. Out it whipped to its full, slim,\r\nsix-foot length and wrapped around her throat. Fangs struck, and in\r\nthree seconds--with a loud _slurp_--it had withdrawn a quart of her\r\nblood. Then it unwrapped just as swiftly as it had come, and leaped\r\ninto the cover of the jungle.\r\n\r\nThe hefty young matron wobbled back to the cabin.\r\n\r\n"Pole!" she called as she hurried in. "I\'ve been slurped!"\r\n\r\n"Again?" her lanky husband asked, looking up from the reports on his\r\ndesk.\r\n\r\n"I\'m so sorry, Pole," she said contritely.\r\n\r\n"Well, sit down and start recovering, Bliss," he said in a kindly\r\nmanner. "You can\'t pick any pretzins today."\r\n\r\n"But I wanted to pick pretzins, Pole. Darn that vacuum snake and his\r\nfast draft."\r\n\r\n"I just hope the neighborhood dragon doesn\'t come around while you\'re\r\nin that weakened condition, Bliss," Pole worried as he totaled up the\r\nmonth\'s production on his reports. He decided, "I had better take time\r\noff from pretzin hunting today so I can be handy to help you with your\r\ngetaway, if need arises."\r\n\r\n"Oh, the dragon never bothers us," Bliss said uneasily.\r\n\r\n"He has gotten close enough to burn up several of our pretzin patches,\r\nthough. He may get to this cabin some day."\r\n\r\n"He doesn\'t mean any harm," defended Bliss. "I\'m sure he wouldn\'t want\r\nto eat us. They are known to be strictly vegetarians."\r\n\r\n"No, he won\'t eat us. He\'ll cook us, unless we can run away fast\r\nenough--but he\'ll never eat us."\r\n\r\nThey heard a faraway sound.\r\n\r\n"What is that crisp crackling that sounds like a dank forest burning?"\r\nwondered Bliss.\r\n\r\nPole scrambled to the door. "The dragon is coming! He\'s headed straight\r\nfor this cabin!"\r\n\r\n"Shall we be going?" asked Bliss, grabbing her clothes.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later, at a distance of a thousand yards, Pole and Bliss,\r\nloaded with all their portable possessions, watched their cabin burst\r\ninto flames as a roaring, forty-foot lizard, with fifty-foot flames\r\ngouting from his mouth, ambled through their clearing.\r\n\r\n"There, he\'s gone," said Pole as the dragon passed on. "I\'d better put\r\nout the fire."\r\n\r\nDipping water from a nearby pond with a bucket, Pole had, after\r\nfifty-three fast buckets, a blackened ruin of what had formerly been\r\ntheir rude jungle cabin.\r\n\r\nPole moved a new, nearly finished split-pole settee he had been working\r\non back in the jungle to their front porch. As they seated themselves,\r\nhe complacently surveyed the slits burned between the charred boards of\r\nthe walls and roof. "The roof will leak a mite when it rains, but it\r\nwill let in lots of light," he observed optimistically.\r\n\r\n"There\'s nothing like lots of light," Bliss agreed.\r\n\r\n"Charcoal is healthful, too."\r\n\r\n"It absorbs poison like nobody\'s business!"\r\n\r\n"However, since it rains every day on Venus we will have to have a new\r\ncabin." He sighed resignedly. "And you know what that means: Lower\r\nproduction, fewer of the magical, antibiotic pretzins. I\'d better radio\r\nthe Division Chief."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs the jet plane flashed across their vision, the Kentons saw a tiny\r\nbundle drop from it. Pole ran out into the jungle and was under the\r\nparachute when it landed. He came back into the clearing unwrapping a\r\npackage.\r\n\r\n"It sure was thoughtful of Mr. Wattles to answer so fast," said Pole,\r\nas he opened the little package. "And will you look here in the middle!\r\nHe even sent us a present!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s a beautiful, plain white, rectangular carton of approximately\r\nthree by seven inches," she said breathlessly.\r\n\r\n"But we mustn\'t be selfish," Pole reminded hastily. "Let\'s see what Mr.\r\nWattles has to say in his memorandum here first." They both read the\r\ngreen memorandum.\r\n\r\n    To: Napoleon B. Kenton, Special Agent, Pretzin Division, Venus\r\n\r\n    From: Chief, Pretzin Division, Venusport, Venus\r\n\r\n    Subject: Personal Problems of Special Agents\r\n\r\n    In a radio message dated January 25, 1982 you related certain\r\n    personal problems you were experiencing, and you stated that delays\r\n    might be encountered in your harvesting of pretzins. We regret your\r\n    difficulties. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
However, it is believed these misfortunes may be\r\n    overcome during leisure hours and should be soon resolved without\r\n    loss of a measurable part of your productive time.\r\n\r\nPole interrupted his reading to beam at his wife. "He\'s sorry for us,\r\nBliss, and he hopes things will be better for us soon.

=== Chunk 6 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t he the nicest man?"\r\n\r\nThey read on.\r\n\r\n    In your radio message you refer to difficulties you are having with\r\n    a snake and a lizard (which you colloquially refer to as a dragon).\r\n    It is believed that the enclosed package, serial number 93G-18,\r\n    will cope with the matter, and that no further report will be\r\n    necessary with respect to snakes and lizards.\r\n\r\n    Carl Wattles\r\n    Chief, Pretzin Division\r\n\r\nEagerly Bliss Kenton opened the plain white carton bearing the serial\r\nnumber 93G-18. She slid out the two and three-quarter by six and\r\none-half inch fumigation bomb can.\r\n\r\nBliss read the label. "\'Lizards and snakes go \'way and stay. Only\r\n$1.19 F.O.B.U.S.A.\' Why, it rhymes!" she said, a wondering smile\r\nlighting her face.\r\n\r\n"Does it say how long the lizards are that go \'way and stay?" Pole\r\nasked anxiously, thinking of the neighborhood\'s forty-foot hellion.\r\n\r\n"_All_ lizards, it says. And only $1.19."\r\n\r\n"Good! But how about snakes that can jump ten feet and wrap around your\r\nthroat?"\r\n\r\n"I read that wrong," she amended. "All lizards _and snakes_. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
And only\r\n$1.19."\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad," said Pole, choking up.\r\n\r\n"The Division Chief has been thinking of us," said Bliss, wiping away a\r\ntear.\r\n\r\n"He knows we field personnel have our problems."\r\n\r\n"He knew just what we needed," lauded Bliss.\r\n\r\nPole looked up from the canister as he heard a sound. "And here comes\r\nthe dragon back! Our lizard repellent arrived just in the nick of time!"\r\n\r\nDown the rain-forest aisle the roaring mammoth rapidly waddled. Its\r\nflames--even longer than its body--withered into blackened ruin\r\nall that stood before it. This time, instead of snatching up their\r\npossessions and fleeing to safety, the Kentons stood their ground\r\nwith their pocket-size fumigation bomb that had been designed for\r\npocket-sized lizards. When the dragon was within throwing distance,\r\nPole flipped on the spray jet of the tiny bomb and threw it as\r\nstraight as he could. Then both of them sped away, leaving all their\r\npossessions at the mercy of the advancing, ravening flames....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Oh, Pole! Isn\'t our new home just the dandiest that a Venusian\r\npretzin-gathering couple ever had?"\r\n\r\n"It _is_ dandy," concurred Pole. "Who\'d ever have thought we would\r\nhave a cabin that was only an inch thick, and yet was absolutely water\r\ntight?"\r\n\r\n"The table makes a dandy smokestack too, when it\'s propped up.\r\nFireproof."\r\n\r\n"How about the mouth when it\'s propped open?" challenged Pole. "Who\r\ncould beat a front porch like that?"\r\n\r\n"You can\'t. You just can\'t!"\r\n\r\n"Correct." He ruminated, "We\'d never have been able to cut the hide.\r\nNot a tough, inch-thick one like this one."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll never get over the way you gutted the dragon. You cut him loose\r\ninside, just below the tonsils--"\r\n\r\n"And after I lassoed them, I gave a run--"\r\n\r\n"And all his guts came stringing out!"\r\n\r\n"Had him cleaned to the bone within an hour!" said Pole proudly.\r\n\r\n"We would never have had it so good if it hadn\'t been for Mr. Wattles\'\r\nhelpfulness," reminded Bliss. "That fumigation bomb, besides making a\r\nhorrible stink--"\r\n\r\n"--explodes when it enters a dragon\'s flaming mouth--and blows his\r\nmethane tanks."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
