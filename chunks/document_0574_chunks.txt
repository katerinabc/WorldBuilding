Nelson\r\n\r\n            MacMartree knew that Man was omnipotent--Master\r\n               of the Universe. But could he expect his\r\n            patrol to fight and conquer an invisible enemy?\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Imagination Stories of Science and Fantasy\r\n                             October 1952\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThey made their camp high on the breast of the gently swelling hill. As\r\nthe small planet turned toward the sunset, MacMartree stood a moment on\r\nthe hillside, watching. Far out on the grass-covered plain their ship\r\nstood gleaming, a slender candle, touched by the flame of the sinking\r\nsun. Then, quickly, the far horizon caught the sun and pulled it under,\r\nand the gloom of night rushed in to drown the pale twilight.\r\n\r\n"Night comes so fast here," Abner said, at MacMartree\'s side.\r\n\r\n"Yes," MacMartree agreed, turning to him. "And day comes even faster.\r\nTime for sleep now, with morning only four hours away."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t get used to it," Abner said as they moved back into the camp\r\narea. "Sleeping and waking in four hour bits!"\r\n\r\nMacMartree laughed at that. "Abner, you\'re getting old. You can\'t adapt\r\nanymore."\r\n\r\nAbner laughed, too, and unrolled his sleep-kit for the night.\r\n\r\nMacMartree walked to the place where Phillips and Cole lay on the\r\nground, talking casually and watching the stars.\r\n\r\n"Time to switch on the screen, Phillips," MacMartree reminded the\r\nyounger man.\r\n\r\nPhillips nodded, sat up and reached for the control box that lay on the\r\nearth beside him. He closed the circuit, and the force-screen bloomed\r\naround them, glimmering softly like a thin veil of glowing fireflies.\r\n\r\n"Kind of useless, that, don\'t you think?" Cole asked.\r\n\r\nMacMartree sat down beside them.\r\n\r\n"It\'s one of the rules, and no patrol ever came to grief by following\r\nthe rules."\r\n\r\nPhillips lay back on the turf. "No patrol ever came to grief at all,\r\nyou mean. I\'m bored to death."\r\n\r\nMacMartree smiled tolerantly. "I know. It\'s a quiet life."\r\n\r\nAbner came over and joined them, completing the party. "What\'re you\r\nthree up to?" he wanted to know.\r\n\r\nMacMartree yawned. "They\'re trying to get me to argue with them, as an\r\nexcuse for not sleeping."\r\n\r\n"Not a bad idea, either," Cole grinned.\r\n\r\n"You youngsters will be the death of me," MacMartree complained. "Don\'t\r\nyou know an old man needs his sleep?"\r\n\r\n"Come on, Mac," Phillips teased. "Tell us why the patrols are\r\nnecessary."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey all laughed then, and MacMartree grinned. "I know how it is with\r\nyou young ones," he said. "You\'re tired of the dull and safe life back\r\nhome and joined the Service, only to find it just as dull and safe as\r\nanything else."\r\n\r\n"Tell me," Phillips put in, "can\'t anything happen to us anymore?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," Cole said. "We can die of old age."\r\n\r\nIt didn\'t take much. The three young men had known it wouldn\'t take\r\nmuch to get MacMartree started ... it seldom did.\r\n\r\n"Youth never fails to amaze me," he said. The younger men recognized it\r\nas a preamble, and settled themselves comfortably in the warm darkness\r\nto listen.\r\n\r\n"Look at you now," he went on. "You complain that your life here on\r\nPatrol is tedious and uninteresting. Nothing ever happens, you say.\r\nAnd it means nothing to you that the dangers and misfortunes you talk\r\nof never threaten you because you have been given the power to prevent\r\nand cope with anything."\r\n\r\nHe sat up now, warming to his subject. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
"You take no pride in your\r\nheritage. Man is completely sufficient unto himself, and beyond that.\r\nThere is an old word I have found in my reading...." He paused, trying\r\nto remember.\r\n\r\n"Omnipotent," he said at last. "Man is omnipotent."\r\n\r\n"All-potent?" Abner asked. "All-powerful?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s right ... it\'s an archaic word, but it fits," MacMartree told\r\nthem. "But you don\'t appreciate your power, because you don\'t realize\r\nwhat your life would be without it.\r\n\r\n"In my books, I\'ve read of the things our species suffered, before our\r\nknowledge reached fulfillment. When we were bound to Earth, there were\r\nwars; men--killed one another."\r\n\r\nThe young men shook their heads, wondering at the folly of their kind\r\nmany thousands of years before.\r\n\r\n"And there were other things, too. As we cut ourselves loose from\r\nEarth, and burrowed into the farthest reaches of the Galaxies, looking\r\nfor new worlds like this one, there were terrible dangers, dreadful\r\nenemies and elements to cope with. And at first, man was foolish ...\r\ncontinually meeting his enemies on their own ground. Until at last, our\r\nwisdom prevailed.\r\n\r\n"We devised ways and means to detect and destroy anything that\r\nendangered us, long before the danger could be manifested. Like here,\r\non this planet ... but you know about that."\r\n\r\n"Radiation, wasn\'t that it?" said Cole.\r\n\r\n"Yes," MacMartree said. "The discovery ship took its readings from out\r\nthere somewhere, out where this place was only a dust mote in the glare\r\nof its sun. They drained off the radiation, scattered it into the void,\r\nthen seeded the place with grass and went away."\r\n\r\n"But that\'s what I don\'t understand," Phillips objected. "Why must we\r\npatrol? When the discoverers found this planet, they destroyed the only\r\nthing about it that could be harmful to man ... so why must we be here?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMacMartree shrugged. "Caution, boy ... call it caution. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
We are here\r\nto see and observe. The discoverers do not accept their readings as\r\ninfallible, though I suspect that they are. We\'re here on the one\r\nchance in a hundred million that somewhere on this little world,\r\nthere\'s a being or an element that might bear enmity toward mankind."\r\n\r\nAbner sighed. "And so we patrol ... for a year."\r\n\r\n"Yes," MacMartree agreed. "For a year. And after the year, another\r\npatrol, and another year, and so on through a hundred patrols and\r\nyears, until the place is classified safe for colonization."\r\n\r\n"I think my species is cowardly," Cole said, a trifle hotly.\r\n\r\n"Cautious," MacMartree corrected gently. "Only cautious. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
It\'s as it\r\nshould be ... they have set up rules of caution, and we\'ve never\r\nsuffered for it."\r\n\r\n"Except from boredom," Phillips cut in, and they all laughed again.\r\n\r\n"Really though," said MacMartree, "you should be proud, not bored.\r\nThink of it, if the sun that just rolled down the horizon should\r\nsuddenly begin to expand into a super-nova, it\'s within our ability\r\nto restore it to its normal status. Should a comet sweep this planet\r\ntonight and drag a tail of poisonous gases over us as we sleep, our\r\nforce screen would protect us, and our mechanisms and devices would\r\nmake the air sweet and clean for us in minutes. If--oh, but you know.\r\nAppreciate your power, your ability. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Be glad you are what you are!"\r\n\r\nThe young men smiled in the darkness, because, of course, they _were_\r\nproud, and satisfied, and pleased with their own omnipotence.\r\n\r\nMacMartree slept the sleep of the aged, curled in the clinging, billowy\r\nwarmth of his sleep-kit. It took him a minute to rouse, when Cole came\r\nand shook him by the shoulder.\r\n\r\n"It\'s Phillips," Cole was saying. "Come and see him, Mac, come and see."\r\n\r\n"Eh?" MacMartree questioned. "What about Phillips?"\r\n\r\n"There\'s something--something wrong with him. I don\'t know ... come and\r\nsee, Mac!"\r\n\r\nAbner lighted the lamp, and MacMartree blinked against the glare that\r\nflooded the area within the screen. Then, as his eyes grew accustomed\r\nto the brilliance, he saw what was happening to Phillips.\r\n\r\n"You see?" Cole said, in great agitation. "Something is wrong with him."\r\n\r\nAs they watched, the stricken Phillips retched and vomited again.\r\nMacMartree\'s nostrils crinkled at the offensive odor of it.\r\n\r\n"Throw a disposal over that," he directed Abner. The younger man went\r\nto his pack and returned with the disposal unit. One of the disposal\r\nwafers took care of the mess Phillips had made.\r\n\r\n"What\'s wrong with him?" Abner asked, completely bewildered.\r\n\r\nMacMartree searched his memory for the word. "Sick," he said at last.\r\n"Phillips is sick."\r\n\r\n"Sick?" Cole echoed.\r\n\r\n"What\'s that?" Abner wanted to know.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, exactly. I\'ve only read about it, in my books. A long\r\ntime ago, men got sick, like this."\r\n\r\n"But why?" Abner and Cole said it together.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know." He bent down over Phillips. "Are you going to do that\r\nanymore?" he asked.\r\n\r\nPhillips looked up at him dully. "I ... I don\'t think so," he said,\r\nweakly and breathlessly.\r\n\r\n"Lie back," MacMartree commanded. "Close your eyes. Sleep if you can.\r\nMaybe we can help you."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPhillips nodded, lips bluish and tight, his whole face a ghastly pewter\r\nhue. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
He put his head down, eyelids fluttered shut. MacMartree regarded\r\nhim in silence for several minutes.\r\n\r\n"This could be what you\'ve been wanting," he said at last to Cole and\r\nAbner.\r\n\r\n"Wanting?"\r\n\r\n"Something\'s happening, isn\'t it? 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Something we didn\'t look for. Maybe\r\nthere\'s reason for patrols after all, eh?"\r\n\r\nCole frowned. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
"You mean...." He didn\'t finish it. He got up quickly,\r\nand strode to the scanner.\r\n\r\n"Everything\'s all right outside," he said, after a moment. "Everything\r\noutside the screen is just as it was at sundown."\r\n\r\nMacMartree shrugged. "Nothing from out there could do this to Phillips\r\nanyway. Nothing gets through the screen."\r\n\r\nCole returned and squatted down with the others. He picked up a handful\r\nof pebbles and began flicking them, one at a time, at the force-screen,\r\nwatching them bounce back into the area.\r\n\r\n"There\'s an explanation for this, of course," MacMartree said, with a\r\ntone of confidence he did not feel.\r\n\r\nThe others nodded. After a time, Phillips\' breathing grew more regular\r\nand he slept. As they watched, the rest of them saw the color creep\r\nback into his face, and sensed that he was better now. But still, it\r\nwas a puzzling thing. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
Phillips had been ... what was the word?...\r\nSick. According to MacMartree\'s histories, no man had been sick for the\r\nlast thousand years.\r\n\r\nThey decided to return to their sleep-kits for the remaining hour of\r\ndarkness, but they never got there.\r\n\r\nRising from his position beside the sleeping Phillips, Abner\'s long\r\nframe lurched suddenly forward. He sprawled at the feet of MacMartree\r\nand Cole ... and both men heard the dull snap as Abner hit the ground,\r\nhis left arm caught beneath his body.\r\n\r\nMacMartree cursed. "Blast it, Abner, pick up your feet!" Then to Cole:\r\n"Is the bone-mending stuff here, or in the ship?"\r\n\r\nCole started to say that he had brought it along, all right, but he was\r\ninterrupted by Abner\'s scream.\r\n\r\nThe sound of it rasped across their nerves. They stared down at\r\nthe writhing Abner, their brains numbed by that horrible, entirely\r\nunfamiliar sound.\r\n\r\n"What is it?" Cole questioned, finding his voice after a moment.\r\nMacMartree ignored him, kneeling beside Abner.\r\n\r\nAbner\'s wind sucked into his lungs, and was expelled in another fearful\r\nscream. In spite of himself, MacMartree felt a prickling along the back\r\nof his neck....\r\n\r\n"Abner," he said intensely, "Abner, listen to me!"\r\n\r\nBut the younger man was doubled in a knot of agony, screaming and\r\nscreaming and screaming.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMacMartree struck him in the face, with his open palm at first, but\r\nwhen that did no good, with doubled fists, hard. Finally Abner\'s\r\nscreams stopped. Then MacMartree tried again.\r\n\r\n"Listen, Abner ... can you hear me now?"\r\n\r\nAbner\'s voice came twisting up, thin and quavery.\r\n\r\n"I--hear you ... yes, I hear you...."\r\n\r\n"Your arm, is that what makes you scream? Your arm?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," moaning now ... "yes, my arm ... I want to die ... let me\r\ndie, please Mac, please...."\r\n\r\n"Listen to me," MacMartree commanded fiercely. "Get hold of yourself\r\nand listen! This thing in your arm, it\'s a _hurt_. Your brain should\r\nbe blocking it from your consciousness, but somehow it isn\'t. Do you\r\nunderstand me?"\r\n\r\n"Hurt," Abner echoed. Then he began to croon it, as though there was\r\nsomething soothing in the sound of it: "Hurt, hurt, hurt in my arm...."\r\nHe made a twisted little hymn of it, singing it over and over again.\r\n\r\n"That\'s right," MacMartree was saying, "Your brain isn\'t killing the\r\nhurt, as it should. You must _think_, Abner, think of your arm, whole\r\nand well, and with no hurt in it. _Think!_"\r\n\r\nBut Abner only repeated that ancient, awful word: "Hurt in my arm ...\r\nhurt, _hurt_...."\r\n\r\nMacMartree shrugged, and looked up at Cole, who was still standing\r\nhelplessly by.\r\n\r\n"Fetch the serum," MacMartree said. "I\'ll try setting the bone...." He\r\ngrasped the twisted arm as he spoke, and one, tearing, final scream\r\nbroke out of Abner\'s throat. Before MacMartree could react, Abner went\r\nrigid in every limb, then as suddenly relaxed and was still.\r\n\r\n"He\'s dead," Cole choked. "Abner is dead!"\r\n\r\nMacMartree felt for the heartbeat, shook his head.\r\n\r\n"Only unconscious. The hurt did that, I suppose." 

=== Chunk 10 ===
He sat back on his\r\nhaunches, thoroughly baffled. Cole sat, too, and a few yards away,\r\nwhere they had left him, Phillips stirred. He rolled over on his side\r\nand propped himself shakily on one elbow, roused by that last, ringing\r\nshriek of Abner\'s.\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t right," MacMartree said, to neither of them. "The hurt, that\r\nwent with sickness--a thousand years ago." He looked up at them.\r\n\r\n"I read about these things, you see," he told them. "There was hurt,\r\nand there was sickness. When they knew enough about the human brain,\r\nscientists simply bred into the part of our minds that makes us aware\r\nof hurt the power to shut it off, automatically, before we\'re even\r\nconscious it exists. And as for sickness...." He looked at Phillips,\r\nshaking his head. "They got rid of that, too, and now...."\r\n\r\nNeither of the younger men said anything for a time. They waited,\r\ndesperately relying on the older man to help them, to bring them\r\nthrough this, whatever it was, into familiar ground again. At length,\r\nCole spoke.\r\n\r\n"Mac," he began softly.\r\n\r\nMacMartree looked at him, waiting.\r\n\r\n"Mac, I ... I feel something ... I don\'t know ... perhaps it\'s\r\nsickness ... or hurt ... I\'ve never known those things...." He held\r\nforth his hands, and they were twitching and trembling.\r\n\r\nMacMartree\'s teeth ground together. "Another obsolescent word I\'ll have\r\nto teach you," he said to them. "It is _fear_."\r\n\r\nHe went to work on Abner\'s broken arm, setting it and injecting the\r\nserum that would cause the fracture to knit in a matter of minutes.\r\nAnd as he worked, he tried to drive the nagging thought from his\r\nmind ... sickness for Phillips, hurt for Abner, fear for Cole ...\r\n_what for MacMartree?_ He was the oldest. He was leader of the patrol.\r\nPerhaps a little of _all_ these horrors?\r\n\r\nTo keep his mind occupied, he counted off the required minutes for\r\nthe serum to take effect. Then, when the time had passed, he gave the\r\ninjured arm an experimental twist.\r\n\r\nIt flapped loosely at the break, as before, and Abner stirred and\r\nmoaned behind the veil of his unconsciousness.\r\n\r\nThe serum had failed. _Unheard of!_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nStraightening, MacMartree felt his particular affliction engulf him.\r\nAnger, wild, unreasoning anger at this intangible, invisible enemy that\r\ntormented them so. Cursing, he scooped up the vial of serum, flung\r\nit to clatter against the shimmering force-screen. But it did not.\r\nIt passed through the curtain which was suddenly nothing more than\r\nthinning mist ... and then not even that.\r\n\r\n"Weapons!" MacMartree cried, his voice a hoarse bellow. "Weapons and\r\npositions! Quickly!"\r\n\r\nPhillips and Cole scrambled to obey. The three conscious men huddled\r\nback to back around the body of the unconscious one. Their weapons\r\nwere small and unfamiliar in their waiting hands, and not the least\r\nbit reassuring. They waited for whatever it was that stalked them from\r\nbeyond the ring of their glaring lamplight to come for them, battle\r\nwith them, make itself known.\r\n\r\n"MacMartree," Phillips whispered in the throbbing stillness.\r\n\r\n"Well? Are you sick again?

=== Chunk 11 ===
"\r\n\r\n"No, no--I just thought...."\r\n\r\n"Yes?"\r\n\r\n"The screen, the serum ... failing that way. What if ... the\r\n_weapons_...."\r\n\r\nA piece of eternity passed them by before MacMartree could make his\r\nlips form the command.\r\n\r\n"Test--your weapons."\r\n\r\nNothing.\r\n\r\nTentatively, fearfully, the three squeezed the metal in their icy\r\nhands. _Nothing._ No rush of power, no leaping death to meet their\r\nadversary when it came. Their weapons, too, had failed them.\r\n\r\nBehind him, MacMartree heard the racking sobs begin in Cole. He did\r\nnot recognize them as sobs, but he sensed their meaning, and knew, of\r\ncourse, what caused them.\r\n\r\nHe also heard Phillips scramble to his feet, his wind sucking in and\r\nout of his throat in short, gasping shudders. He waited for Phillips\r\nto break and run into the darkness, fleeing in blind panic for the\r\ndistant sanctuary of the ship on the plain below. But the darkness that\r\nsurrounded them stared Phillips down, sent him grovelling back to the\r\nearth, a whipped and whimpering cur.\r\n\r\nAnd then, MacMartree was alone. He had never felt so lonely in his life\r\nbefore. The three younger men were there, of course, but they, too,\r\nwere lost in voids of aloneness. He envied the unconscious Abner, until\r\nhe felt Abner stir slightly on the ground behind him, and then go tense\r\nwith waking. So they were all to meet it, and be aware when it came.\r\n\r\nBut, such _loneliness_! Such a need he felt, for something to hold to,\r\nto reach for, to depend on. Another of their weapons? He knew better.\r\n\r\nThere had to be something, there had to be. 

=== Chunk 12 ===
But what? Beaten,\r\nvanquished, he covered his face with his hands, and waited.\r\n\r\nThe little planet rolled steadily toward the sunrise, the cold stars\r\nglided above them. Quietly, the dawn breeze simpered among the grasses.\r\n\r\nQuite slowly, MacMartree raised his head.\r\n\r\n"Abner, Phillips, Cole...." They didn\'t answer, but he knew they heard\r\nhim, and were listening, within their individual worlds of aching\r\nloneliness and fear.\r\n\r\n"I ... I know what our Enemy is," MacMartree said.\r\n\r\nThey came a little closer to him then, venturing out of themselves a\r\nfraction to hear what he said.\r\n\r\n"Our Enemy," MacMartree told them, "is God."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter a pause, the inevitable question came. Phillips voiced it for the\r\nrest.\r\n\r\n"What is--God?"\r\n\r\nMacMartree shook his head. "A myth--a legend--I thought. There were so\r\nmany things in all those ancient books I read ... how was I to know?"\r\n\r\n"This is something you read, too?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, in a very old book. In many of them, actually, but one in\r\nparticular. A book called--" the name eluded him. He let it go. "God\r\nwas a deity. People worshipped Him, thousands of years ago."\r\n\r\nCole had stopped his crying.\r\n\r\n"The book was written as the Word of God. I--I remember a part of\r\nit...."\r\n\r\n"Tell us," dully, from Abner.\r\n\r\n"\'I the Lord thy God am a jealous God.\' I think that explains it best."\r\nHe sighed. 

=== Chunk 13 ===
"It\'s my fault, I suppose. Man is omnipotent, I said. Man is\r\nall-powerful. Man can do _anything_! Yes, it was enough to rouse the\r\nanger of a jealous God."\r\n\r\n"Is He going to kill us, then?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, Phillips. He could have, long before this...."\r\n\r\n"How can we fight Him," Cole whispered. "How?"\r\n\r\n"We can\'t," the old man said. "God is the only omnipotent One. We are\r\nnot." He got to his feet, came around to face them.\r\n\r\n"One thing we can do."\r\n\r\n"What?" they wanted to know. "What can we do?"\r\n\r\n"We can try to--talk to Him."\r\n\r\nThe grassy world sped softly toward its dawning. Beyond the hill that\r\nrose above them, lean fingers of light came creeping from the lifting\r\nsun. It seemed to come in answer to those stumbling, clumsy, fervent\r\nprayers--the first prayers that had touched the lips of men in a\r\nthousand years.\r\n\r\nLost in concentration, MacMartree felt the sweet breath of the sun\'s\r\nfirst warmth upon his back. He opened his eyes, found them dimmed\r\nsomehow, and a wetness on his cheeks.\r\n\r\nWonderingly, they looked at one another, awed by what they read upon\r\neach other\'s faces.\r\n\r\n"I forgot," MacMartree said softly. "I forgot that He is also\r\nmerciful...."\r\n\r\nAbner slowly raised his arm.\r\n\r\n"It\'s healed," he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
