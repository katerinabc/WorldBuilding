But how does one deliver a principle?\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Imagination Stories of Science and Fantasy\r\n                             February 1957\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTorlyn Khy smiled grimly to himself as he thought of the approaching\r\ncompletion of the new Earth spaceship. Thus far, his disguise had\r\ncompletely fooled the Earthmen; they didn\'t even begin to suspect\r\nthat a Valdorian spy was among the engineers who were building the\r\n_Skyjumper_.\r\n\r\nHigh above the spacefield it loomed, a great sphere of metal that\r\nhoused the new teleportation drive. Torlyn Khy looked up at its\r\nimpressive bulk. Unlike the common type of spaceship, which had a top\r\nspeed of ten thousand lights, the new drive could take the ship from\r\nEarth to any point in the galaxy in a fraction of a microsecond. If it\r\nwere successful, Earth would win the war against Valdor in a matter of\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n_And if not--_\r\n\r\nJohn Mitchell, the Chief Engineer of Sahara Spaceport, said: "She\'s a\r\nbeauty, isn\'t she, Pete?"\r\n\r\nTorlyn Khy, in his disguise as Earthman "Peter Blane," smiled and said,\r\n"Yes. She\'s a real beauty. When will she be finished?"\r\n\r\n"This afternoon," Mitchell said. "The boys are tightening the last\r\nbolts and putting in the final wiring now. The job\'s just about over,\r\nPete.

"\r\n\r\n_Good!_ thought Torlyn. _I\'ll be able to take it tonight._ To be able\r\nto bring both the spaceship\'s plans and the ship itself back to Valdor\r\nwould be a major feat. It would result in a fine promotion.\r\n\r\nThe ship was entirely different from any other vessel ever built. The\r\nhyperkinetic generator in its center generated a spherical force field\r\naround the ship which projected it to wherever it had been aimed for.\r\n\r\nIt was simple to operate; all the pilot had to do was set up the\r\nco-ordinates of his target, turn on the hyperkinetic generator, and\r\npress the activator button. The generator itself did the rest. The\r\nfield enclosed the ship, and instantaneously the ship was a hundred or\r\na thousand light-years away.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat evening, Torlyn Khy stepped out of his room and strolled over\r\ntoward the spaceship. It was surrounded by guards, and it was bathed\r\nin the blaze of a battery of searchlights, but that did not bother\r\nthe Valdorian. Earthmen were such stupid fools! It would be a blessing\r\nfor them if the Valdorians took them over and showed them how to run\r\ntheir lives efficiently. On Valdor, everyone had a job and he did it.\r\nHe obeyed his superiors without asking questions, and the society,\r\ntherefore, was efficient.\r\n\r\nBut these Earthmen! Such a lax, sloppy, inefficient society! They\r\nneeded more regimentation, more precision. They needed to learn to obey\r\norders. And they _would_ learn--after the Valdorian victory.\r\n\r\n"Evening, Mr. Mitchell."\r\n\r\n"Good evening, Captain. Nice night, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\nTorlyn Khy looked around warily and saw the lean, spare figure of\r\nJohn Mitchell standing some distance away. He was talking to a man\r\nin a military uniform, one of the guards posted on the project. The\r\nValdorian ducked away; he didn\'t care to be seen. Not tonight, of all\r\nnights.\r\n\r\nHe walked all around the spaceship, studying it carefully from all\r\nangles, keeping well out of sight of the guards that surrounded it.\r\n\r\nThe ship appeared to be ready to go; all he had to do was get inside\r\nand take off. Simple. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Very simple, Torlyn Khy thought. The greatest\r\nvictories are always simple.\r\n\r\nThe ship was supposed to be lifted above the atmosphere on her jets\r\nbefore the hyperkinetic generator was used, but the generator could, in\r\nan emergency, be used on the ground. Torlyn Khy smiled. As far as he\r\nwas concerned, this _would_ be an emergency. The Earthmen, he thought\r\npleasantly, would feel very foolish when their greatest ship simply\r\nvanished from under their noses.\r\n\r\nAfter making a thorough reconnaissance of the area, the Valdorian\r\ndecided he was ready. He switched on the tiny power pack at his waist,\r\nand the invisibility belt he was wearing was energized. If anyone had\r\nbeen watching the shadows where Torlyn Khy was standing, they would\r\nhave seen a faint blue glow as the Valdorian faded slowly from sight.\r\n\r\nThen, boldly, the alien strode toward the _Skyjumper_. Nothing stood in\r\nthe way of success now.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe walked directly across the well-lighted safety area, and the guards\r\npaid not the slightest attention.\r\n\r\nAt the airlock door, he paused to take stock of the situation. He had\r\nto move fast now. The success of the whole mission depended on timing\r\nfrom here on out. The guards, naturally, would see the airlock door\r\nswing open; they would know something was wrong. It would take them, he\r\nestimated, about four minutes to bring up heavy armament to blast the\r\ndoor open.\r\n\r\nMoistening his lips nervously, he decided to correct the estimate.\r\n_Better make it three minutes for safety\'s sake_, he thought.\r\n\r\nIn that time, he would have to warm up the generator and punch the\r\nco-ordinates for the planet Valdor into the big guiding computer. Doing\r\nthat would require, say, two minutes--giving him a minute\'s leeway.\r\nGood!\r\n\r\nHe waited until the guards all seemed to be looking away from the\r\nairlock door. Then he pressed the lock. The door swung open, and Torlyn\r\nKhy stepped quickly inside.\r\n\r\nThere was a shout from one of the guards below, but they were too late\r\nto do anything; the Valdorian had the airlock door closed before they\r\ncould see what had happened. He turned the master switch on the inside\r\nof the door, which locked the door against any outside interference.\r\n\r\nHe grinned sardonically. The fool Earthmen would have a devil of a time\r\ndoing anything now!\r\n\r\nThe next thing was to switch off his invisibility belt. It was\r\ndifficult to do delicate work if you couldn\'t see your own arms and\r\nfingers, and punching co-ordinates into a computer was a delicate job.\r\n\r\nHe turned toward the inner door--and, at that moment, the door opened!\r\nAn Earthman stepped out, an engineer named Harris who had apparently\r\nbeen making some last-minute adjustments on the ship.\r\n\r\n"Oh, hello, Blaine," Harris said. "I--"\r\n\r\nWithout a word, the Valdorian leaped forward, taking the Earthman by\r\nsurprise. He slammed his fist into Harris\' abdomen, and he doubled up\r\nin pain.\r\n\r\nTorlyn Khy jumped back as the Earthman\'s foot suddenly sliced toward\r\nhim. The toe of the engineer\'s foot hit him stingingly alongside the\r\njaw, but the Valdorian managed to grasp the foot and twist.\r\n\r\nThen he bent and picked Harris up, and knocked him down again with a\r\ncrashing blow to the chin.\r\n\r\nHe left the unconscious Earthman on the floor, locking him inside the\r\nairlock. He would be no trouble there.\r\n\r\nThe real trouble was that the fight had delayed his timing; it must\r\nhave taken all of a minute, and in a split-second operation such as\r\nthis an interval of a minute could be fatal. Without wasting any more\r\ntime, he got moving. His jaw hurt where the Earthman had slugged him,\r\nand his fingers felt stiff.\r\n\r\nHe ran down the corridor to the control room. The big automatic\r\ncomputer was ready to go. Torlyn Khy switched it on, waited for a\r\nmoment, and then hastily began punching co-ordinates into the computer.\r\nHe had to hurry; the Earthmen might blast their way into the ship at\r\nany moment. Still, he dared not make an error; if he did, the ship\r\nmight end up a thousand light-years from where it was supposed to\r\nmaterialize--perhaps in the heart of a sun.\r\n\r\nThere was perspiration dripping from his brow by the time he was\r\nfinished. He turned on the hyperkinetic generator and waited for it to\r\nwarm up. Still there was no sound from the airlock.\r\n\r\nA red indicator light on the control panel came on, telling him that\r\nthe generator was ready. With a triumphant smile, Torlyn Khy reached\r\nout and pressed the activator stud.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOutside the ship, the guards watched the airlock door.\r\n\r\n"I wonder why Dr. Harris did that?" said a lieutenant.\r\n\r\n"Who knows?" a sergeant replied.\r\n\r\nThey had seen the airlock open and close, but knowing that Harris was\r\nstill inside, they had thought little of it. Still, it was odd.\r\n\r\nThe airlock door swung open again. Harris stepped out, looking dazed.\r\nThe lieutenant ran toward him, and quickly the engineer explained what\r\nhad happened.\r\n\r\n"You mean he\'s inside there? We\'ve got to stop him!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s too late," Harris said. "He didn\'t know that I was doing some\r\nadjusting inside there.

Go ahead and look.

=== Chunk 5 ===
"\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant went to the inner door of the airlock and peered in. The\r\nwhole inside of the ship was gone, vanished as though it had never been.\r\n\r\n"I had just made a slight adjustment of the generator." Harris said\r\nquietly. "The power field was cut down, so the projector field was\r\nsmaller. I\'m afraid our spy simply projected the inside of the\r\nspaceship out into the interstellar vacuum and left the hull behind."\r\n\r\nHe shook his head grimly. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
"Poor devil. He\'ll have quite a surprise in\r\nstore for him--unless he can live without air!"\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
