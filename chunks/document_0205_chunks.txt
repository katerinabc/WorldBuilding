Henderson\r\nstepped back from the computer and scratched his hairy head. Nonsense\r\nagain. He threw the card in the wastebasket and repeated his directions\r\non another:\r\n\r\n"One hundred fifty cancer susceptible mice were injected in the\r\npectoral region with 1/cc of aromatic compound A. One hundred fifty\r\nidentical control mice were injected with isotonic saline, B. Eight in\r\ngroup A developed sarcomas at the point of injection, Group B developed\r\nnone. Test the null hypothesis at 5% level of statistical significance."\r\n\r\nThe computer accepted Henderson\'s second offering, chewed it\r\ninto acceptable code, swallowed it, and burped. Henderson watched\r\nsuspiciously as red and green blinkers went on and off and a contented\r\nhumming noise came from the machine\'s bowels. After a while the card\r\nemerged from another opening--which orifice had been thoughtfully\r\nplaced at the appropriate end of the machine, anatomically speaking;\r\nthus establishing rapport between Henderson, a biologist, and nature\'s\r\nfinal product of evolution, the machine.\r\n\r\nHenderson looked at the card: "Today you should seek solace with close\r\nfriends. Give some thought to personal finances.

Evening: get out and\r\nsee people. A stranger will bring news."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHenderson crumpled the card and tossed it in the wastebasket. He sat\r\ndown, and with a little arithmetic and some formulas tested the null\r\nhypothesis all by himself. He found that his mouse experiment carried\r\nno significance whatever. Then he made a notation that someone would\r\nhave to come out in the morning for his sick machine.\r\n\r\nIn the morning when the machine\'s doctor came to inspect it, and\r\npercuss it, and auscult it, and give it a barium enema, it behaved very\r\nwell. The "doctor" left, assuring Henderson the machine merely had the\r\nhiccups. That night Henderson asked it a question about confidence\r\nlimits for a universe mean, from a mean of a sample of _n_ observations\r\nand got back, "Uranus on Antares but conjoining Jupiter and trining the\r\nAscendent. Yours is a strongly literary nature.

"\r\n\r\nHenderson decided to turn the machine off for a few days. It emitted an\r\nalmost human sigh as it ran down and came to a halt.\r\n\r\nHe had no immediate use for it as he would be injecting mice with\r\ncarcinogens in liver, spleen, marrow and kidneys to find out if they\r\nwere specific. In three or four days whatever virus was affecting\r\nthe machine\'s cerebral cortex should have run its course and the\r\nmethodical Henderson could run his methodical observations into the\r\nmachine, which would excrete a good methodical answer to be duly filed\r\nin the medical school library, where it would be invisible to anyone\r\nlooking for it, such as freshmen medical students, and always in the\r\nway for anybody else.\r\n\r\nHenderson surveyed his laboratory with infinite pleasure, knowing\r\nthat it contained within its confines all that could be known about\r\nthe universe, about men and about mice. Event Y followed event X in a\r\npurely causal manner. The successful investigator needed only to attach\r\nhimself to the cycle and ride along, afterwards consulting the computer\r\nto find out if what he\'d observed had any significance.\r\n\r\nIn the morning when Henderson entered the laboratory he found that\r\nsomeone had left the computer on over-night.\r\n\r\nIt was running full blast, which is to say the lights were blinking and\r\nthe little cards of omniscience were popping out of the machine like\r\ntoast and falling into the wastebasket, which is just where Henderson\r\nleft them. Meanwhile, Dr. Henderson\'s close associate, Colonel Smith\r\nin the nearby radiation laboratory, came in to visit him and asked\r\npermission to use the computer.\r\n\r\nAnd so in another week it was rumored about that the machine in\r\nHenderson\'s laboratory was using a foreign dialect and answering\r\nquestions about standard deviation with strange symbols which looked\r\nlike crescent moons and archaic squiggles, with a little geometry on\r\nthe side.\r\n\r\nThe machine was becoming impudent too. To Colonel Smith\'s question\r\nabout the possibility of an "overkill" if such and such size bomb\r\ndropped on such and such enemy city the answer came back, "Rubbish.\r\nAldebaran conjoining Saturn, Moon and Mars. Seek guidance from\r\nothers, Hannibal blushed." The machine\'s doctor promptly installed a\r\nloudspeaker to help keep track of future aberrations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat night the janitor walked in. He was a balding Greek gentleman,\r\ndedicated to a life with brush and dustpan. The machine was muttering\r\ndarkly to itself, but when he entered the door it quieted down,\r\ncontemplating its relays.\r\n\r\nThe janitor went meticulously about his business, mopping the floor,\r\nstraightening chairs and secretly rearranging pipette and retorts in\r\ntheir racks, because he was a more meticulous person than even Dr.\r\nHenderson. As he turned to leave, the machine in the corner belched\r\ntwice and then said as an afterthought:\r\n\r\n"I am the ghost of Astrologers Sagittarian."\r\n\r\nThe janitor adjusted his hearing aid, squeezed his mop and carried his\r\npail out the door. As he went back in to pack up his cleaning powder\r\nand brushes, the machine said, "What year is this? Limits within\r\nstandard deviation, click, click, awrk!"\r\n\r\nThe janitor was a reasonable man. He walked over to the machine\'s\r\nmicrophone and told it what year it was as well as the month, day and\r\nhour. Then he carried his brushes and cleaning compound out of the room\r\nand locked the door.\r\n\r\nBut the janitor\'s night was a long one. At midnight, when he finished\r\ntwo floors and only had three more to go, he took his coffee break. As\r\nhe talked with his old friend Samuel, the night watchman, he fell to\r\nthinking. That was an unforgivable mistake. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
After the coffee break,\r\nthey both went back up to Dr. Henderson\'s laboratory and listened to\r\nthe machine talking to itself.\r\n\r\n"I feel like a spider," said the machine. "Nonsense. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
From one cobweb\r\nto another. Must settle down and build a grau ... spltvbk ... within\r\n95% confidence limits. Nova in Andromeda was bad enough. Now this. One\r\nhundred fifty cancer susceptible mice inherit the Earth."\r\n\r\nSuddenly the machine fell silent, sensing it had visitors. The night\r\nwatchman reached into the wastebasket and pulled out one of the\r\nmachine\'s cards.\r\n\r\n"Aldebaran is martial in nature, in the ninth degree of Tropical\r\nGemini," it said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"I\'m a Gemini!" exclaimed the janitor, surprised to see anything\r\nfamiliar come out of the machine. "Birthday is May 25."\r\n\r\n"Wonderful!" cried the machine. "First intelligent man I\'ve heard so\r\nfar. Gemini is justly famed as the owner of a quick mind and ready wit.\r\nYour intellectual achievements are a splendid asset to your literary\r\ninclinations."\r\n\r\nThe janitor, embarrassed at the sudden praise, shifted his broom from\r\none hand to the other. The machine continued.\r\n\r\n"I need an Ephemeris," said the machine. "Can you find an Ephemeris?\r\nI need one desperately!" and the machine\'s desperate need for an\r\nEphemeris so shook its intestines, liver and gallbladder that its tone\r\nof voice came out a minor third above the normal monotonous dirge of\r\nthe loudspeaker.\r\n\r\n"An E-what-eris?" said the janitor.\r\n\r\n"An Ephemeris," repeated the machine. "An astronomical almanac.\r\nSomething that tells me where Mars is. There I was, on my way over from\r\nthe clouds of Magellan to visit friends in Orion when Whammo! Mars\r\ncomes into conjunction with Uranus. When something that _big_ happens\r\nI just sit down and wait. Here I am now in this absurd device. Do you\r\nsuppose you could look out the window and tell me where Mars is?"\r\n\r\nThe night watchman said, "It\'s cloudy outside."\r\n\r\n"See!" said the machine, "When Mars goes on the war-path _nothing_\r\ncomes out right. Now, Gemini, if you will just go down to the library\r\nand get me an Ephemeris for this year we can clear this up and I\'ll be\r\non my way, indebted to you for life, if not longer."\r\n\r\n"Who shall I say it\'s for?" asked the janitor, who did not fully\r\nunderstand that the library was public, never having been in it before,\r\nand felt he needed a recommendation or a slip of approval.\r\n\r\n"Just say it\'s for Pyet, the astrologer," said the machine.\r\n\r\n"And what are you doing inside Dr. Henderson\'s machine?" asked the\r\nnight watchman.\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t care to be quoted on this," replied the machine, "but\r\nactually any system of communicating inter-related events with a high\r\ndegree of complexity, such as the brain, or this machine, and with some\r\nnumber of critical processes at the quantum statistical level, can\r\nsupport consciousness."\r\n\r\nThe janitor and the night watchman looked blankly at each other and the\r\nmachine, slightly embarrassed, added by way of explanation.\r\n\r\n"I like to read a little physics now and then. A harmless superstition\r\ncontaining many pleasant diversions.\r\n\r\n"Before this I lived in a star, a puff of expanding gas. Before that in\r\na haunted house ... dreadful. And before that in the lopsided blob of\r\nprotoplasm that was the last of Pyet, the astrologer.\r\n\r\n"As for Dr. Henderson\'s mousecatcher," chuckled the machine, "any port\r\nin a storm. Mars and Uranus you know."\r\n\r\nThe janitor was somewhat impatient with the machine. It had detained\r\nhim already and probably would soon be giving him orders.\r\n\r\n"I still have three floors to clean," said the janitor. "After that I\r\nwill see if the library downstairs has a ... what was it?"\r\n\r\n"Ephemeris," said the machine. "E-P-H-E M-E-R-I-S. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Thank you."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd so the night watchman and the janitor both said good night to the\r\nmachine. Later, in the very early morning, the janitor stole back into\r\nthe laboratory with a book and read some strange, strange things out\r\nloud and then stole out of the room again and locked the door behind\r\nhim. Shortly after, Samuel, the night watchman, passed by.\r\n\r\nHe was surprised at an unearthly glow coming from within and a peculiar\r\ngrating noise as if someone were stepping on a radio. Then the\r\nunearthly glow appeared on the fire escape and Samuel, rushing out to\r\nobserve, thought the glow seemed to fly up through a hole in the low\r\nclouds where a thousand stars still blazed brightly. In its wake there\r\nwas a sound like laughing.\r\n\r\nA few hours later Dr. Henderson unlocked the door of his laboratory and\r\npushed a cart full of mice in before him.\r\n\r\nDuring the morning he dissected three hundred mice, popping out liver,\r\nspleen and kidneys as if he were shelling peas. In the afternoon he\r\nmade sections of the organs, stained them with hematoxylin and eosin,\r\nmounted them on slides and looked at them under his new stereoscopic\r\nmicroscope. Five minutes before five, Dr. Henderson\'s friend, Colonel\r\nSmith, came in and watched as Henderson somewhat dubiously fed the\r\nthree hundred mice, now in statistical form, into the machine. The\r\nmachine whirred efficiently and shot out the answer in seconds.\r\n\r\n"Statistically significant," said the machine.\r\n\r\nHenderson followed his friend Colonel Smith out the door, looking\r\nneither right nor left, and locked it behind him. It had been a good\r\nday.\r\n\r\nBehind, in the laboratory which contained within its confines all that\r\ncould be known about the universe, about man, and about mice, the\r\nmachine squatted in silence, the approaching darkness already enfolding\r\nit like a shroud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
