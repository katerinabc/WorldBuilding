They\'re all\r\n     weirdies of one kind or another.\r\n       Me? Oh,_\r\n\r\n               _I\'m A Stranger\r\n                 Here Myself_\r\n\r\nBy MACK REYNOLDS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Place de France is the town\'s hub. It marks the end of Boulevard\r\nPasteur, the main drag of the westernized part of the city, and the\r\nbeginning of Rue de la Libert\xc3\xa9, which leads down to the Grand Socco and\r\nthe medina. In a three-minute walk from the Place de France you can go\r\nfrom an ultra-modern, California-like resort to the Baghdad of Harun\r\nal-Rashid.\r\n\r\nIt\'s quite a town, Tangier.\r\n\r\nKing-size sidewalk cafes occupy three of the strategic corners on the\r\nPlace de France. The Cafe de Paris serves the best draft beer in town,\r\ngets all the better custom, and has three shoeshine boys attached to the\r\nestablishment. You can sit of a sunny morning and read the Paris edition\r\nof the New York _Herald Tribune_ while getting your shoes done up like\r\nmirrors for thirty Moroccan francs which comes to about five cents at\r\ncurrent exchange.\r\n\r\nYou can sit there, after the paper\'s read, sip your expresso and watch\r\nthe people go by.\r\n\r\nTangier is possibly the most cosmopolitan city in the world. In native\r\ncostume you\'ll see Berber and Rif, Arab and Blue Man, and occasionally a\r\nSenegalese from further south. In European dress you\'ll see Japs and\r\nChinese, Hindus and Turks, Levantines and Filipinos, North Americans and\r\nSouth Americans, and, of course, even Europeans--from both sides of the\r\nCurtain.\r\n\r\nIn Tangier you\'ll find some of the world\'s poorest and some of the\r\nrichest. The poorest will try to sell you anything from a shoeshine to\r\ntheir not very lily-white bodies, and the richest will avoid your eyes,\r\nafraid _you_ might try to sell them something.\r\n\r\nIn spite of recent changes, the town still has its unique qualities. As\r\na result of them the permanent population includes smugglers and\r\nblack-marketeers, fugitives from justice and international con men,\r\nespionage and counter-espionage agents, homosexuals, nymphomaniacs,\r\nalcoholics, drug addicts, displaced persons, ex-royalty, and subversives\r\nof every flavor. Local law limits the activities of few of these.\r\n\r\nLike I said, it\'s quite a town.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI looked up from my _Herald Tribune_ and said, "Hello, Paul. Anything\r\nnew cooking?"\r\n\r\nHe sank into the chair opposite me and looked around for the waiter. The\r\ntables were all crowded and since mine was a face he recognized, he\r\nassumed he was welcome to intrude. It was more or less standard\r\nprocedure at the Cafe de Paris. It wasn\'t a place to go if you wanted to\r\nbe alone.\r\n\r\nPaul said, "How are you, Rupert? Haven\'t seen you for donkey\'s years."\r\n\r\nThe waiter came along and Paul ordered a glass of beer. Paul was an\r\neasy-going, sallow-faced little man. I vaguely remembered somebody\r\nsaying he was from Liverpool and in exports.\r\n\r\n"What\'s in the newspaper?" he said, disinterestedly.\r\n\r\n"Pogo and Albert are going to fight a duel," I told him, "and Lil Abner\r\nis becoming a rock\'n\'roll singer."\r\n\r\nHe grunted.\r\n\r\n"Oh," I said, "the intellectual type." 

=== Chunk 2 ===
I scanned the front page. "The\r\nRusskies have put up another manned satellite."\r\n\r\n"They have, eh? How big?"\r\n\r\n"Several times bigger than anything we Americans have."\r\n\r\nThe beer came and looked good, so I ordered a glass too.\r\n\r\nPaul said, "What ever happened to those poxy flying saucers?"\r\n\r\n"What flying saucers?"\r\n\r\nA French girl went by with a poodle so finely clipped as to look as\r\nthough it\'d been shaven. The girl was in the latest from Paris. Every\r\npore in place. We both looked after her.\r\n\r\n"You know, what everybody was seeing a few years ago. It\'s too bad one\r\nof these bloody manned satellites wasn\'t up then. Maybe they would\'ve\r\nseen one."\r\n\r\n"That\'s an idea," I said.\r\n\r\nWe didn\'t say anything else for a while and I began to wonder if I could\r\ngo back to my paper without rubbing him the wrong way. I didn\'t know\r\nPaul very well, but, for that matter, it\'s comparatively seldom you ever\r\nget to know anybody very well in Tangier. Largely, cards are played\r\nclose to the chest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy beer came and a plate of tapas for us both. Tapas at the Cafe de\r\nParis are apt to be potato salad, a few anchovies, olives, and possibly\r\nsome cheese. Free lunch, they used to call it in the States.\r\n\r\nJust to say something, I said, "Where do you think they came from?" And\r\nwhen he looked blank, I added, "The Flying Saucers."\r\n\r\nHe grinned. "From Mars or Venus, or someplace."\r\n\r\n"Ummmm," I said. "Too bad none of them ever crashed, or landed on the\r\nYale football field and said _Take me to your cheerleader_, or\r\nsomething."\r\n\r\nPaul yawned and said, "That was always the trouble with those crackpot\r\nblokes\' explanations of them. If they were aliens from space, then why\r\nnot show themselves?"\r\n\r\nI ate one of the potato chips. It\'d been cooked in rancid olive oil.\r\n\r\nI said, "Oh, there are various answers to that one. We could probably\r\nsit around here and think of two or three that made sense."\r\n\r\nPaul was mildly interested. "Like what?"\r\n\r\n"Well, hell, suppose for instance there\'s this big Galactic League of\r\ncivilized planets. But it\'s restricted, see. You\'re not eligible for\r\nmembership until you, well, say until you\'ve developed space flight.\r\nThen you\'re invited into the club. Meanwhile, they send secret missions\r\ndown from time to time to keep an eye on your progress."\r\n\r\nPaul grinned at me. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
"I see you read the same poxy stuff I do."\r\n\r\nA Moorish girl went by dressed in a neatly tailored gray jellaba,\r\nEuropean style high-heeled shoes, and a pinkish silk veil so transparent\r\nthat you could see she wore lipstick. Very provocative, dark eyes can be\r\nover a veil. We both looked after her.\r\n\r\nI said, "Or, here\'s another one. Suppose you have a very advanced\r\ncivilization on, say, Mars."\r\n\r\n"Not Mars. No air, and too bloody dry to support life."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t interrupt, please," I said with mock severity. "This is a very\r\nold civilization and as the planet began to lose its water and air, it\r\nwithdrew underground. Uses hydroponics and so forth, husbands its water\r\nand air. Isn\'t that what we\'d do, in a few million years, if Earth lost\r\nits water and air?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose so," he said. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
"Anyway, what about them?"\r\n\r\n"Well, they observe how man is going through a scientific boom, an\r\nindustrial boom, a population boom. A boom, period. Any day now he\'s\r\ngoing to have practical space ships. Meanwhile, he\'s also got the H-Bomb\r\nand the way he beats the drums on both sides of the Curtain, he\'s not\r\nagainst using it, if he could get away with it."\r\n\r\nPaul said, "I got it. So they\'re scared and are keeping an eye on us.\r\nThat\'s an old one. I\'ve read that a dozen times, dished up different."\r\n\r\nI shifted my shoulders. "Well, it\'s one possibility."\r\n\r\n"I got a better one. How\'s this. There\'s this alien life form that\'s way\r\nahead of us. Their civilization is so old that they don\'t have any\r\nrecords of when it began and how it was in the early days. They\'ve gone\r\nbeyond things like wars and depressions and revolutions, and greed for\r\npower or any of these things giving us a bad time here on Earth. They\'re\r\nall like scholars, get it? And some of them are pretty jolly well taken\r\nby Earth, especially the way we are right now, with all the problems,\r\nget it? 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Things developing so fast we don\'t know where we\'re going or how\r\nwe\'re going to get there."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI finished my beer and clapped my hands for Mouley. "How do you mean,\r\n_where we\'re going_?"\r\n\r\n"Well, take half the countries in the world today. They\'re trying to\r\nindustrialize, modernize, catch up with the advanced countries. Look at\r\nEgypt, and Israel, and India and China, and Yugoslavia and Brazil, and\r\nall the rest. Trying to drag themselves up to the level of the advanced\r\ncountries, and all using different methods of doing it. But look at the\r\nso-called advanced countries. Up to their bottoms in problems. Juvenile\r\ndelinquents, climbing crime and suicide rates, the loony-bins full of\r\nthe balmy, unemployed, threat of war, spending all their money on\r\narmaments instead of things like schools. All the bloody mess of it.\r\nWhy, a man from Mars would be fascinated, like."\r\n\r\nMouley came shuffling up in his babouche slippers and we both ordered\r\nanother schooner of beer.\r\n\r\nPaul said seriously, "You know, there\'s only one big snag in this sort\r\nof talk. I\'ve sorted the whole thing out before, and you always come up\r\nagainst this brick wall. Where are they, these observers, or scholars,\r\nor spies or whatever they are? Sooner or later we\'d nab one of them.\r\nYou know, Scotland Yard, or the F.B.I., or Russia\'s secret police, or\r\nthe French S\xc3\xbbret\xc3\xa9, or Interpol. This world is so deep in police,\r\ncounter-espionage outfits and security agents that an alien would slip\r\nup in time, no matter how much he\'d been trained. Sooner or later, he\'d\r\nslip up, and they\'d nab him.

=== Chunk 6 ===
"\r\n\r\nI shook my head. "Not necessarily. The first time I ever considered this\r\npossibility, it seemed to me that such an alien would base himself in\r\nLondon or New York. Somewhere where he could use the libraries for\r\nresearch, get the daily newspapers and the magazines. Be right in the\r\ncenter of things. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
But now I don\'t think so. I think he\'d be right here\r\nin Tangier."\r\n\r\n"Why Tangier?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s the one town in the world where anything goes. Nobody gives a damn\r\nabout you or your affairs. For instance, I\'ve known you a year or more\r\nnow, and I haven\'t the slightest idea of how you make your living."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right," Paul admitted. "In this town you seldom even ask a man\r\nwhere\'s he\'s from. He can be British, a White Russian, a Basque or a\r\nSikh and nobody could care less. Where are _you_ from, Rupert?"\r\n\r\n"California," I told him.\r\n\r\n"No, you\'re not," he grinned.\r\n\r\nI was taken aback. "What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"I felt your mind probe back a few minutes ago when I was talking about\r\nScotland Yard or the F.B.I. possibly flushing an alien. Telepathy is a\r\nsense not trained by the humanoids. If they had it, your job--and\r\nmine--would be considerably more difficult. Let\'s face it, in spite of\r\nthese human bodies we\'re disguised in, neither of us is humanoid. Where\r\nare you really from, Rupert?"\r\n\r\n"Aldebaran," I said. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
"How about you?"\r\n\r\n"Deneb," he told me, shaking.\r\n\r\nWe had a laugh and ordered another beer.\r\n\r\n"What\'re you doing here on Earth?" I asked him.\r\n\r\n"Researching for one of our meat trusts. We\'re protein eaters. Humanoid\r\nflesh is considered quite a delicacy. How about you?"\r\n\r\n"Scouting the place for thrill tourists. My job is to go around to these\r\nbackward cultures and help stir up inter-tribal, or international,\r\nconflicts--all according to how advanced they are. Then our tourists\r\ncome in--well shielded, of course--and get their kicks watching it."\r\n\r\nPaul frowned. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
"That sort of practice could spoil an awful lot of good\r\nmeat."\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ December 1960.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.
