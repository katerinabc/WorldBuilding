=== Chunk 2 ===
Tau was\r\n           electrical. Yet Tau could face death like a man.\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n                      Planet Stories Summer 1948.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nA gleaming binary swung in the blue sky, sending a moist warmth\r\nacross the swaying fern-growths of the _Fourteenth Planet_. Feathered\r\ncreatures of bright colors flashed through the underbrush and made\r\nnoises there. A figure came stalking down through the shaded clearings,\r\nand small scaly bodies scurried out of sight, leaving ungainly tracks\r\nscrawled in the swamp mud.\r\n\r\nTau, the metal man, a mechanical half-sentient messenger from the\r\nfar distant past, strode impassively along, not heeding the smaller\r\ncreatures of the jungle. He had sighted the tiny habitable world from\r\nthe distant depths of an outer galaxy, and had moored his space-ship in\r\na clearing that was not distant.\r\n\r\nHe halted his berylite six-foot body in a leafy glade and let the wind\r\nplay about his cold outer surface.

The lens-cased inscrutable orbs in\r\nhis head peered about, taking in the scene with photographic detail.\r\n\r\n"Life! This is life!"

he thought to himself. "This is the life the\r\nMaster said I would find some day."\r\n\r\nThough his memories were of a distant past, of a remote planet, and\r\nof the Master whose atoms might lie even now in the etheric dust, Tau\r\nremembered with perfect clarity. He could recall the aged countenance\r\nof the Master, the broad forehead, the jutting chin, and the determined\r\nundertone of his deep voice.\r\n\r\n"Men may die," the Master had said, "but their deeds live after them."\r\nAnd Kendall Smith\'s face had lighted inwardly as though from some deep\r\ninspiration. Tau had said nothing in reply, but in the neurochemical\r\nmechanisms of his brain the words had been imprinted forever.\r\n\r\n"You\'re just a robot," the master had said, "with responses and\r\nreactions that are the involuntary activations of metal and\r\nchemical-change impulse, yet I believe that some day in the aeons which\r\nwill pass, you will learn to reason for yourself to some extent, and\r\nperhaps understand your mission. But you will never live, even though\r\nyou may carry the germs of life into the far distant future."\r\n\r\nAnd now Tau, standing in the mire of that world of the future he had\r\ntalked about, wondered at the mystery which was called Life, and\r\ndoubted if he clearly understood what the Master had meant. One thing\r\nhe knew certainly, that his metallic body was meant to bridge the\r\nepoch which yawned between the life-lines of the past and those of the\r\nfuture. Old Kendall Smith, stalking back and forth in his laboratory,\r\nhad explained as much, and Tau had never forgotten.\r\n\r\n"Our life-line is narrowing, the earth is dying," the Master had\r\nexplained. "That one-in-a-million chance of opportune conditions in\r\nwhich life may exist is vanishing. I doubt if the circumstances can be\r\nduplicated in the entire universe.

But someday, by the very laws which\r\ngovern chance, they must return again. It is not within the powers\r\nof man to bridge the gap of space and time, but you, Tau, the robot,\r\nswinging in the non-conducting realms of the vacuum of space, will be\r\nnext to eternal."\r\n\r\nTau had learned the secrets of extracting radiant energy from the\r\natom, had become adept in applying the forces to the mechanisms that\r\npropelled the space-ship and supplied motivation for his own metal\r\nbody. Many other secrets the Master had taught him in the laboratories,\r\nand he had come to know the uses of the scientific paraphernalia that\r\nwas sealed in the inner heart of the space-craft. When the occasion\r\ncame for Tau to use the equipment, Kendall Smith had said, he would\r\nunderstand the true nature constituting life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe binary descended, and night fell. Glittering shards of the stars\r\npierced the black firmament. Night creatures let out occasional shrieks\r\nand snarls. Once a six-legged catlike creature, half as tall as the\r\nmetal man, was attracted by Tau\'s movements, and sprang upon him. Tau\'s\r\nresponses were mechanical, and he knew no such thing as fear. He simply\r\nripped the creature apart with the tremendous strength that surged in\r\nhis metal arms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Tau tore him to pieces._]\r\n\r\nLater that night he returned to the space-ship. As he approached the\r\ngleaming ovoid a circular door opened. Crossing its threshold, he\r\npassed into the interior, distorted by intricate mechanisms, and the\r\naperture closed behind him.\r\n\r\nSlowly Tau walked to the center of the room, his body reflected in\r\ngleaming surfaces of berylite stanchions and sheathings. In the center\r\nof the whorled contrivances a row of ingenious troughs lay exposed.\r\nEach of these troughs was centered by a molding that had the perfect\r\noutline of a man, empty in the crystalline interior.\r\n\r\nAll that night iridescent gleamings crawled along the monstrous\r\nglassite tubes, illuminating the busy robot with an eerie splendor.\r\nMiniature lightning shot and sparkled from insulated spheres high in\r\nthe nose of the craft. Pulsating, sluggish liquids gave off radiant\r\ncolors and seeped through tortuous channels along the tubes of\r\nglassite. The central troughs became opaque, and formed a webwork\r\nnow into which the throbbing aqueous masses were assembling. A chill\r\ncurrent of the outer atmosphere was forced by rotating blades along a\r\nchannel that whirled in a maelstrom around the central apparatus.\r\n\r\nTau worked swiftly, but days fled by as he watched the quiescent gauges\r\nand indicators, lengthened into months. Blinding storms raged unheeded\r\non the exterior of the ovoid craft. Winter came and fled.\r\n\r\nAt last David and his tribe came to life, all molded from a magnificent\r\nscale. During those long months of creation, Tau had imprinted\r\nknowledge and learning upon the brains of the dormant bodies. Each\r\nawoke with a full knowledge of what had transpired on the dying planet\r\nof earth, and each knew that a strange new-born world awaited them. The\r\nlargest and most magnificent man was named David. The Master had been\r\ncareful in instructing Tau about that. Kendall Smith had never had a\r\nson. And this synthetic offspring in a distant life-line of the cosmos\r\nwould be almost like a son for him.\r\n\r\nAll of Tau\'s knowledges were conveyed to David and his followers, and\r\nhe led them into the unknown dangers of the pristine jungled planet,\r\nguarding them from the ferocious animals while they learned the edible\r\nfruits from the poisonous ones. Gradually David\'s men came to recognize\r\nthe dangers and constructed weapons for their own defense.\r\n\r\nAnother winter descended upon the new world. Food had been stored in\r\nthe big compartment of the space vessel. Furs of slain animals had been\r\ncured to provide clothing and warmth.\r\n\r\nSpring thaws came and Tau led them again into the jungle, but now David\r\nwas big and strong and wary, quite able to defend himself against the\r\ndangers of the forest, and Tau\'s presence was hardly needed, though he\r\nalways hovered near.\r\n\r\nFive men and five women had been given life by Tau\'s instruments, and\r\nit was inevitable that a gradual pairing off would take place. Myri, a\r\nmodel of womanly perfection, had grown to adore the handsome leader of\r\nthe tribe, and Tau was one of the first to notice signs of fecundity.\r\n\r\nA terrific storm lashed the planet. Giant trees groaned and split\r\nacross the trunks. The raging downpour built up into outer floods that\r\nraged down the lowlands in mighty rivers, sweeping everything in its\r\npath to destruction. Of all this Tau was oblivious. The fury of the\r\ntempest was deadened by the berylite walls of the space-ship, and not\r\nas loud as the shrill cry of the new-born babe.\r\n\r\nThunder boomed outside. Lightning forked across the rent heavens,\r\nsending flickering flashes of illumination through the beating sheets\r\nof rain that poured across the glassite sheathing above the neglected\r\ncontrol mechanisms. David the second was born, and for a brief time was\r\ncuddled against the breast of the metal man, whose terribly strong arms\r\nof metal held him as lightly and delicately as could a bed of thistle\r\ndown. The imperturbable orbs of immobile transparency gazed downward,\r\nand suddenly Tau staggered.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDavid took the child with a startled cry and stood eyeing the tottering\r\nrobot. Tau\'s consciousness was centered upon his dragging limbs and\r\nfor a moment his mentality flickered as though it were gone, then\r\nreturned. He saw that his metallic body was dark and stained with an\r\nodd encrustation, and he turned and made his way to the cubicle in\r\nwhich he had sat while an aeon of time slipped away in the depths of\r\ninterplanetary space, and the life-line of one aeon had merged with\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThere was one hooded mechanism at which he always sat, and when he was\r\njust so, the mind of the Master would speak from down the ages, and the\r\nimage of Kendall Smith arose, as it had always done, in his mind. He\r\nthought he visualized the Master now, out of the dim consciousness of\r\nthe past. Tall and arresting with the vigorous personality of a dynamic\r\nintelligence, the keen grey eyes peered at him again, as they had done\r\nin the distant past.\r\n\r\n"You, Tau, are just a man of metal," the Master was saying "and yet\r\nI\'ve a feeling that part of myself is implanted within you just as part\r\nof my mind is implanted into the mechanisms of your consciousness. As\r\na thing of metal, floating in a non-conducting void, you are something\r\nthat is almost eternal. Yet if you succeed in finding a habitable\r\nworld, such as the earth has been in the past, the atmosphere of that\r\nplanet will suffuse about you, and in the triumph of my wishes will lie\r\nyour downfall. Oxides of the surrounding air will cause your gradual\r\ndeterioration, and the only one who could help you will be nothing\r\nmore than motes of cosmic dust in the unpredictable corners of the\r\nsurrounding universe."\r\n\r\nUnseen by David or any of the others, Tau slipped to the door and down\r\na corridorway. Through an aperture he could glimpse the inner room\r\nwhere Myri lay, nursing the infant at her breast. For just an instant\r\nhe paused, for the Master had never seemed closer than in that single\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nTurning finally, the metal man walked impassionately through the\r\ndoorway and vanished into the driving blasts of the lashing storm.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
