]\r\n\r\n\r\nRoby Morrison fidgeted. Walking in the tropical heat he heard the wet\r\nthunder of waves on the shore. There was a green silence on Orthopedic\r\nIsland.\r\n\r\nIt was the year 1997, but Roby did not care.\r\n\r\nAll around him was the garden where he prowled, all ten years of him.\r\nThis was Meditation Hour. Beyond the garden wall, to the north, were\r\nthe High I.Q. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Cubicles where he and the other boys slept in special\r\nbeds. With morning they popped up like bottle-corks, dashed into\r\nshowers, gulped food, and were sucked down vacuum-tubes half across the\r\nisland to Semantics School. Then to Physiology. After Physiology he was\r\nblown back underground and released through a seal in the great garden\r\nwall to spend this silly hour of meditative frustration, as prescribed\r\nby the island Psychologists.\r\n\r\nRoby had his opinion of it. "Damned silly."\r\n\r\nToday, he was in furious rebellion. He glared at the sea, wishing he\r\nhad the sea\'s freedom to come and go. His eyes were dark, his cheeks\r\nflushed, his small hands twitched nervously.\r\n\r\nSomewhere in the garden a chime vibrated softly. Fifteen more minutes\r\nof meditation. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Huh! And then to the Robot Commissary to stuff his dead\r\nhunger as taxidermists stuff birds.\r\n\r\nAnd, after the scientifically pure lunch, through the tube again to\r\nSociology. Of course, late in the warm green afternoon, games would be\r\nplayed in the Main Garden. Games some tremble-brained Psychologist had\r\nevolved from a nightmare haunted sleep. This was the future! You must\r\nlive, my lad, as the people of the past, of the year 1920, 1930 and\r\n1942 predicted you would live! Everything fresh, brisk, sanitary, too,\r\ntoo fresh! 

=== Chunk 5 ===
No nasty old parents about to give one complexes. Everything\r\ncontrolled, dear boy!\r\n\r\nRoby should have been in a perfect mood for something unique.\r\n\r\nHe wasn\'t.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the star fell from the sky a moment later he was only more\r\nirritated.\r\n\r\nThe star was a spheroid. It crashed and rolled to a stop on the hot\r\ngreen grass. A small door popped open in it.\r\n\r\nFaintly, this incident recalled a dream to the child. A dream which\r\nwith superior stubbornness he had refused to record in his Freud Book\r\nthis morning. The dream-thought was in his mind at the exact instant\r\nthat the star-door popped wide and some \'thing\' emerged.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: It was like a dream he had refused to record in his\r\nFreud book.]\r\n\r\nSome \'thing\'.\r\n\r\nYoung eyes, seeing an object for the first time, have to make a\r\nfamiliar thing of it. Roby didn\'t know what this \'thing\' was stepping\r\nfrom the sphere. So, scowling, Roby thought of what it _most\r\nresembled_.\r\n\r\nInstantly the \'something\' became a _certain_ thing.\r\n\r\nWarm air ran cold. Light flickered, form changed, melted, shifted as\r\nthe thing evolved into certainty!\r\n\r\nStartled, a tall thin pale man stood beside the metal star.\r\n\r\nThe man had pink, terrified eyes. He trembled.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I know _you_." Roby was disappointed. "You\'re only the\r\nSandman."\r\n\r\n"Sand--man?"\r\n\r\nThe stranger quivered like heat rising from boiling metal. His shaking\r\nhands went wildly up to touch his long coppery hair as if he\'d never\r\nseen or felt it before. The Sandman gazed in horror at his own hands,\r\nlegs, feet, body, as if they were all new. "Sand--man?" The word was\r\ndifficult. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Talking was new to him, also. He seemed about to flee, but\r\nsomething stopped him.\r\n\r\n"Yeah," said Roby. "I dream about you every night. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Oh, I know what you\r\nthink. Semantically, our teachers say that ghosts, goblins and fairies\r\nand sandmen are labels, only names for which there aren\'t any actual\r\nreferents, no actual objects or things. But to heck with that. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
We kids\r\nknow more than teachers about it. You being here proves the teachers\r\nwrong. There are Sandmen after all, aren\'t there?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t give me a label!" cried the Sandman, suddenly. He seemed to\r\nunderstand now. For some reason he was unutterably frightened. He kept\r\npinching, tugging and feeling his own long new body as if it was a\r\nthing of terror. "Don\'t _name_ me, don\'t label me!"\r\n\r\n"Huh?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m a referent!" screamed the Sandman. "I\'m not a label! I\'m just a\r\nreferent! Let me go!"\r\n\r\nRoby\'s little green cat-eyes slitted. "Say--" He put his hands on his\r\nhips. "Did Mister Grill send you? I bet he did! I bet this is another\r\nof those psychological tests!"\r\n\r\nRoby flushed with dark anger. Always and forever they were at him.\r\nThey sorted his games, food, education, took away his friends and his\r\nmother, his father, and now--played tricks on him!\r\n\r\n"I\'m not from Mr. Grill," pleaded the Sandman. "Listen, before anyone\r\nelse comes and sees me this way and makes it worse!"\r\n\r\nRoby kicked violently. The Sandman danced back, gasping:\r\n\r\n"Listen. I\'m not human, you are!" he shouted. "Thought has moulded the\r\nflesh of all you here on this world! You\'re all dictated to by labels.\r\nBut I--I am a _pure_ referent!"\r\n\r\n"Liar!" More kicking from Roby.\r\n\r\nThe Sandman gibbered with frustration. "The truth, child! Centuries\r\nof thought have moulded your atoms to your present form; if you\r\ncould undermine and destroy that belief, the beliefs of your friends,\r\nteachers and parents, you could change form, be a pure referent, too!\r\nLike Freedom, Liberty, Humanity, or Time, Space and Justice!"\r\n\r\n"Grill sent you; he\'s always pestering me!"\r\n\r\n"No, no! Atoms are malleable. You\'ve accepted certain labels on Earth,\r\ncalled Man, Woman, Child, Head, Hands, Fingers, Feet. You\'ve changed\r\nfrom anything into something."\r\n\r\n"Leave me alone," protested Roby. "I\'ve a test today, I have to think."\r\nHe sat on a rock, hands over his ears.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Sandman glanced fearfully about, as if expecting disaster. Standing\r\nover Roby, he was beginning to tremble and cry. "Earth could have been\r\na thousand other ways. Thought, using labels, went around tidying up\r\na disordered cosmos. Now, no one bothers trying to think things into\r\nother, different shapes!"\r\n\r\n"Go away," sniffed Roby.\r\n\r\n"I landed near you, not suspecting the danger. I was curious. Inside\r\nmy spheroid space ship, thoughts cannot change my shape. I\'ve traveled\r\nfrom world to world, over the centuries, and never been trapped like\r\n_this_!" Tears sprang down his face. "And now, by the gods, you\'ve\r\nlabeled me, caught me, imprisoned me with thought! This Sandman idea.\r\nHorrible! I can\'t fight it, I can\'t change back! And if I can\'t change\r\nback I\'ll never fit into my ship again, I\'m much too large. I\'ll be\r\nstranded on Earth, forever. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
Release me!"\r\n\r\nThe Sandman screamed, wept, shouted. Roby\'s mind wandered. He debated\r\nquietly with himself. What did he want most of all? Escape from this\r\nisland. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
Silly. They always caught you. What then? Games, maybe. Like\r\nto play regular games, minus psycho-supervision. Yeah, that\'d be nice.\r\nKick-the-can, or spin-the-bottle, or even just a rubber ball to bounce\r\non the garden wall and catch, all to himself. Yeah. A red ball.\r\n\r\nThe Sandman cried, "Don\'t--"\r\n\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\nA red rubber ball bounced on the ground.\r\n\r\nUp and down bounced the red rubber ball.\r\n\r\n"Hey!" It took Roby a moment to realize the ball was there. "Where\'d\r\nthis come from?" He hurled it against the wall, caught it. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
"Gee!"\r\n\r\nHe didn\'t notice the absence of a certain stranger who had been\r\nshouting at him a few moments before.\r\n\r\nThe Sandman was gone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWay off in the hot distance of the garden a bonging noise sounded. A\r\ncylinder was rushing up the tube to the wall\'s circular door. The door\r\npeeled open with a faint hiss. Footsteps rustled measuredly along the\r\npath. Mister Grill stepped through a lush frame of tiger-lillies.\r\n\r\n"Morning, Roby. Oh!" Mister Grill stopped, his chubby pink face looked\r\nas if it had been kicked. "What have you there, boy?" he cried.\r\n\r\nRoby bounced the object against the wall.\r\n\r\n"This? A rubber ball."\r\n\r\n"Eh?" Grill\'s small blue eyes blinked, narrowing. Then he relaxed.\r\n"Why, of course. For a moment I thought I saw--uh--er--"\r\n\r\nRoby bounced the ball some more.\r\n\r\nGrill cleared his throat. "Lunch time. Meditation Hour is over. And I\'m\r\nnot certain that Minister Locke would enjoy your playing unorthodox\r\ngames."\r\n\r\nRoby swore under his breath.\r\n\r\n"Oh, well, then, go on. Play. I won\'t tattle." Mr. Grill was in a\r\ngenerous mood.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t feel like playing." Roby sulked, shoving his sandal-tip into\r\nthe dirt. Teachers spoiled everything. You couldn\'t vomit without\r\npermission.\r\n\r\nGrill tried to interest the boy. "If you come to lunch now I\'ll let you\r\ntelevise your mother in Chicago afterward."\r\n\r\n"Time limit, two minutes, ten seconds, no more no less," was Roby\'s\r\nacid reply.\r\n\r\n"I gather you don\'t approve of things, boy."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll run away some day, wait and see!

=== Chunk 12 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Tut, lad. We\'ll always bring you back, you know."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t ask to be brought here in the first place." Roby bit his lip,\r\nstaring at his new red rubber ball. He thought he had seen it kind of,\r\nsort of, well--_move_. Funny. He held the ball in his hand. The\r\nball shivered.\r\n\r\nGrill patted his shoulder. "Your mother is neurotic. Bad environment.\r\nYou\'re better off here on the island. You have a high I.Q. and it is\r\nan honor for you to be here with the other little boy geniuses. You\'re\r\nunstable and unhappy and we\'re trying to change that. Eventually\r\nyou\'ll be the exact antithesis of your mother."\r\n\r\n"I love mother!"\r\n\r\n"You _like_ her," corrected Grill, quietly.\r\n\r\n"I like mother," replied Roby, disquieted. The red ball twitched in his\r\nhand, without his touching it. He looked at it with wonder.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll only make it harder for yourself if you love her," said Grill.\r\n\r\n"You\'re god-damn silly," said Roby.\r\n\r\nGrill stiffened. "Don\'t swear. Besides, you don\'t really mean god\r\nand you don\'t mean damn. There\'s very little of either in the world.\r\nSemantics Book Seven, page 418, Labels and Referents."\r\n\r\n"Now, I remember," shouted Roby, looking around. "There was a Sandman\r\nhere just now and he said--"\r\n\r\n"Come along," said Mr. Grill. "Lunch time."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCommissary food emerged from robot-servers on extension springs. Roby\r\naccepted the ovoid plate and milk-globe silently. Where he had hidden\r\nit, the red rubber ball pulsed and beat like a heart under his belt. A\r\ngong rang. He gulped food swiftly. The tumble for the tube began. They\r\nwere blown like feathers across the island to Sociology and then, later\r\nin the afternoon, back again for games. Hours passed.\r\n\r\nRoby slipped away to the garden to be alone. Hatred for this insane,\r\nnever-stopping routine, for his teachers and his fellow students\r\nflashed through him in a scouring torrent. He sat alone and thought of\r\nhis mother, a long great distance away. In great detail he recalled how\r\nshe looked and what she smelled like and how her voice was and how she\r\ntouched and held and kissed him. He put his head down into his hands\r\nand began to fill the palms of his hands with small tears.\r\n\r\nHe dropped the red rubber ball.\r\n\r\nHe didn\'t care. He only thought of his mother.\r\n\r\nThe jungle shivered. Something shifted, quickly.\r\n\r\nA woman ran through the deep grass!\r\n\r\nShe ran away from Roby, slipped, cried out, and fell.\r\n\r\nSomething glittered in the sunlight. The woman was running toward that\r\nsilvery glittering thing. The spheroid. The silver star ship! And where\r\nhad _she_ come from? And why was she running toward the sphere?\r\nAnd why had she fallen as he looked up? She didn\'t seem to be able to\r\nget up.\r\n\r\nRoby leaped from his rock, gave chase. He caught up with and stood over\r\nthe woman.\r\n\r\n"Mother!" he screamed.\r\n\r\nHer face shivered and changed, like melting snow, then took on a hard\r\ncast, became definite and handsome.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not your mother," she said.\r\n\r\nHe didn\'t hear. He only heard his own breath moving over his shaking\r\nlips. He was so weak with shock he could hardly stand. He put out his\r\nhands toward her.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you understand?" her face was cold. "I\'m not your mother. Don\'t\r\nlabel me! Why must I have a name! Let me get back to my ship! I\'ll kill\r\nyou if you don\'t!"\r\n\r\nRoby swayed. "Mother, don\'t you know me? I\'m Roby, your son!" He wanted\r\nonly to cry against her, tell her of the long months of imprisonment.\r\n"Please, please, Mom, please remember me!"\r\n\r\nSobbing, he moved forward and fell against her.\r\n\r\nHer fingers tightened on his throat.\r\n\r\nShe strangled him.\r\n\r\nHe tried to scream. The scream was caught, pressed back into his\r\nbursting lungs. He flailed his legs.\r\n\r\nDeep in her cold, hard, angry face, Roby found the answer even as her\r\nfingers tightened and things grew dark.\r\n\r\nDeep in her face he saw a vestige of the Sandman.\r\n\r\nThe Sandman. The star falling on the summer sky. The silver sphere, the\r\nship toward which this \'woman\' had been running. The disappearance of\r\nthe Sandman, the appearance of the red ball, the vanishing of the red\r\nball and now the appearance of his mother. It all fitted!\r\n\r\nMatrixes. Moulds. Thought habits. Patterns. Matter. The history of man,\r\nhis body, all things in the universe.\r\n\r\nShe was killing him.\r\n\r\nShe would make him stop thinking, then she would be free.\r\n\r\nThoughts. Darkness. He could barely move, now. Weak, weak. He had\r\nthought \'it\' was his mother. It wasn\'t. Nevertheless \'it\' was killing\r\nhim. What if Roby thought something else? Try, anyway. 

=== Chunk 13 ===
Try it. 

=== Chunk 14 ===
He\r\nkicked. In the wild darkness he thought, hard, hard.\r\n\r\nWith a wail, his \'mother\' withered before him.\r\n\r\nHe concentrated.\r\n\r\nHer fingers dwindled from his throat. Her bright face crumbled. Her\r\nbody shrank to another size.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe was free. He rose up, gasping.\r\n\r\nThrough the jungle he saw the silver sphere lying in the sun. He\r\nstaggered toward it, then cried out with the sharp thrill of the plan\r\nthat formed in his mind.\r\n\r\nHe laughed triumphantly. He stared once more at \'it\'. What was left of\r\nthe woman form changed before his eyes, like melting wax. He reshaped\r\nit into something new.\r\n\r\nThe garden wall trembled. A vacuum cylinder was hissing up through the\r\ntube. Mr. Grill was coming. Roby would have to hurry or his plan would\r\nbe ruined.\r\n\r\nRoby ran to the spheroid, peered in. Simple controls. Just enough room\r\nfor his small body--_if_ the plan worked. It had to work. It would\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe garden trembled with the approaching thunder of the cylinder. Roby\r\nlaughed. To hell with Mister Grill! To hell with this island!\r\n\r\nHe thrust himself into the ship. There was much he could learn, it\r\nwould come in time. He was just on the skirt of knowledge now, but that\r\nlittle knowledge had saved his life, and now it would do even more.\r\n\r\nA voice cried out behind him. A familiar voice. So familiar that it\r\nmade Roby shudder. Roby heard small boy feet crash the underbrush.\r\nSmall feet on a small body. A small voice pleading!\r\n\r\nRoby grasped the ship controls. Escape. Complete and unsuspected.\r\nSimple. 

=== Chunk 15 ===
Wonderful. Grill would never know.\r\n\r\nThe sphere door slammed. Motion.\r\n\r\nThe star, Roby inside, rose on the summer sky.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Grill stepped out of the seal in the garden wall. He looked around\r\nfor Roby. Sunlight struck him warmly in the face as he hurried down the\r\npath.\r\n\r\nThere! There was Roby. In the clearing ahead of him. Little Roby\r\nMorrison staring at the sky, making fists, crying out to nobody. At\r\nleast Grill could see nobody about.\r\n\r\n"Hello, Roby," called Grill.\r\n\r\nThe boy jerked at the sound. He--wavered--in color, density, and\r\nquality. Grill blinked, decided it was only the sun.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not Roby!" cried the child. "Roby escaped! He left me to take his\r\nplace, to fool you so you wouldn\'t hunt for him! He fooled me, too!"\r\nscreamed the child, nastily, sobbing. "No, no, don\'t _look_ at me!\r\nDon\'t think that I\'m Roby, you\'ll make it worse! You came expecting to\r\nfind him, and you found me and made me into Roby! You\'re moulding me\r\nand I\'ll never, never, _never_ change, now! Oh, God!"\r\n\r\n"Come now, Roby--"\r\n\r\n"Roby\'ll never come back. I\'ll _always_ be him. I was a rubber\r\nball, a woman, a Sandman. But, believe me, I\'m only malleable atoms,\r\nthat\'s all. Let me go!

=== Chunk 16 ===
"\r\n\r\nGrill backed up slowly. His smile was sick.\r\n\r\n"I\'m a referent, I\'m _not_ a label!" cried the child.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, I understand. Now, now, Roby, Roby, you just wait right\r\nthere, right there now, while I, while I, while I call the Psycho-Ward."\r\n\r\nMoments later, a corps of assistants ran through the garden.\r\n\r\n"God damn you all!" screamed the child, kicking. "Damn you!"\r\n\r\n"Tut," declared Grill quietly, as they forced the child into the\r\nvac-cylinder. "You\'re using a label for which there is no referent!"\r\n\r\nThe cylinder sucked them away.\r\n\r\nA star blinked on the summer sky and vanished.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
