So, here\'s Binder and a neatly wrapped-up package of a\r\n    folktale of the future._\r\n\r\n\r\n shipwreck\r\n        in\r\n       the\r\n       sky\r\n\r\n _by ... Eando Binder_\r\n\r\n\r\n The flight into space that made\r\n Pilot-Capt. Dan Barstow famous.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe flight was listed at GHQ as _Project Songbird_. It was sponsored by\r\nthe Space Medicine Labs of the U.S. Air Force. And its pilot was Captain\r\nDan Barstow.\r\n\r\nA hand-picked man, Dan Barstow, chosen for the AF\'s most important\r\nproject of the year because he and his VX-3 had already broken all\r\nprevious records set by hordes of V-2s, Navy Aerobees and anything else\r\nthat flew the skyways.\r\n\r\nDan Barstow, first man to cross the sea of air and sight open, unlimited\r\nspace. Pioneer flight to infinity. He grinned and hummed to himself as\r\nhe settled down for the long jaunt. Too busy to be either thrilled or\r\nscared he considered the thirty-seven instruments he\'d have to read, the\r\ntwice that many records to keep, and the miles of camera film to run. He\r\nhad been hand-picked and thoroughly conditioned to take it all without\r\nmore than a ten percent increase in his pulse rate. So he worked as\r\nmatter-of-factly as if he were down in the Gs Centrifuge of the Space\r\nMedicine Labs where he had been schooled for this trip for months.\r\n\r\nHe kept up a running fire of oral reports through his helmet radio, down\r\nto Rough Rock and his CO. "All Roger, sir ... temperature falling fast\r\nbut this rubberoid space suit keeps me cozy, no chills ... Doc Blaine\r\nwill be happy to hear that! Weightless sensations pretty queer and I\r\nfeel upside-down as much as rightside-up, but no bad effects.... Taking\r\nshots of the sun\'s corona now with color film ... huh? Oh, yes, sir,\r\nit\'s beautiful all right, now that you mention it. But, hell, sir, who\'s\r\ngot the time for aesthetics now?... Oops, _that_ was a close one! 

=== Chunk 2 ===
Tenth\r\nmeteor whizzing past. Makes me think of flak back on those Berlin\r\nbombing runs."\r\n\r\nDan couldn\'t help wincing when the meteors peppered down past. The\r\n"flak" of space. Below he could see the meteors flare up brightly as\r\nthey hit the atmosphere. Most of those near his position were small,\r\nnone bigger than a baseball, and Dan took comfort in the fact that his\r\nrocket was small too, in the immensity around him. A direct hit would be\r\nsheer bad luck, but the good old law of averages was on his side.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Colonel, this tin can I\'m riding is holding together okay," Dan\r\ncontinued to Rough Rock. If he paused even a second in his reports a\r\ntop-sergeant\'s yell from the Colonel\'s throat came back for him to keep\r\ntalking. Every bit of information he could transmit to them was a vital\r\nrevelation in this USAF-Alpha exploration of open space beyond Earth\'s\r\nair cushion, with ceiling unlimited to infinity.\r\n\r\n"Cosmic rays, sir? Sure, the reading shot up double on the Geiger ...\r\nhuh? Naw, I don\'t feel a thing ... like Doc Baird suspected, we invented\r\na lot of Old Wives\' Tales in _advance_, before going into space. I feel\r\nfine, so you can put down cosmic ray intensity as a Boogey Man....\r\nWhat\'s that? Yeah, yeah, sir, the stars shine without winking up here.\r\nWhat else?... Space is inky black--no deep purples or queer\r\nmore-than-blacks like some jetted-up writers dreamed up--just plain old\r\nordinary dead black. Earth, sir?... Well, it does look dish-shaped from\r\nup here, concave.... Sure, I can see all the way to Europe and--say!\r\nHere\'s something unexpected. I can see that hurricane off the coast of\r\nFlorida.... You said it, sir! Once we install permanent space stations\r\nup here it will be easy to spot typhoons, volcano eruptions, tidal\r\nwaves, earthquakes, what have you, the moment they start. If you ask me,\r\nwith a good telescope you could even spot forest fires the minute they\r\nbroke out, not to mention a sneak bombing on a target city--uh, sorry,\r\nsir, I forgot."\r\n\r\nDan broke off and almost retched as his stomach turned a flip-flop to\r\nend all flip-flops. The VX-3 had reached the peak of its trajectory at\r\nover 1000 miles altitude and now turned down, lazily at first. He gulped\r\noxygen from the emergency tube at his lips and felt better.\r\n\r\n"Turning back on schedule, Rough Rock. Peak altitude 1037 miles.\r\nEverything fine, no danger. This was all a cinch.... HEY! 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Wait....\r\nSomething not in the books has popped up ... stand by!"\r\n\r\nDan had felt the rocket swing a bit, strangely, as if gripped by a\r\nstrong force. Instead of falling directly down toward Earth with a\r\nslight pitch, it slanted sideways and spun on its long axis. And then\r\nDan saw what it was....\r\n\r\nBeneath, intercepting his trajectory, coming around fast over the\r\ncurvature of Earth, was a tiny black worldlet, 998 miles above Earth. It\r\nmight be an enormous meteor, but Dan felt he was right the first time.\r\nFor it wasn\'t falling like a meteor but swinging parallel to Earth\'s\r\nsurface on even keel.\r\n\r\nHe stared at the unexpected discovery, as amazed as if it were a\r\nfire-breathing dragon out of legend. For it was, actually, he realized\r\nin swift, stunned comprehension, more amazing than any legend.\r\n\r\nDan kept his voice calm. "Hello, Rough Rock.... Listen ... nobody\r\nexpected _this_ ... hold your hat, sir, and sit down. I\'ve discovered a\r\n_second moon_ of Earth!... Uhhuh, you heard me right! a second moon! Tie\r\nthat, will you?... Sure, it\'s tiny, less than a mile in diameter I\'d\r\nsay. Dead black in color. Guess that\'s why telescopes never spotted it.\r\nTiny and black, blends into the black backdrop of space. It has terrific\r\nspeed. And that little maverick\'s gravitational field caught my\r\nrocket.... Of course it can\'t yank me away from Earth gravity, but the\r\ntrouble is--yipe! my rocket and that moonlet may be in for a mutual\r\n_collision_ course...."\r\n\r\nDan\'s trained eye suddenly saw that grim possibility. Barreling around\r\nEarth in a narrow orbit with a speed of something near or over 12,000\r\nmiles an hour the tiny new moon had, since his ascent, charged directly\r\ninto his downward free fall. It was a chance in a thousand for a direct\r\nhit, except for one added factor--the moonlet exerted enough gravity\r\npull out of its many-million ton bulk to warp the rocket into its path.\r\nAnd the thousand-to-one odds were thus wiped out, becoming even money.\r\n\r\n"Nip and tuck," reported Dan, answering the excited pleadings and\r\nquestions from Rough Rock. "It won\'t be a head-on crash. I may even miss\r\nentirely.... Oh, Lord! Not with that spire of rock sticking up from\r\nit.... I\'m going to hit that ..."\r\n\r\nDan had heard an atomic bomb blast once and it sounded like a string of\r\nthem set off at once as the rocket smashed into the rocky prominence.\r\nThe rock splintered. The rocket splintered. But Dan was not there to be\r\nsplintered likewise. He had jammed down a button, at the critical\r\nmoment, and the rocket\'s emergency escape-hatch had ejected him a\r\nsplit-second before the violent impact.\r\n\r\nBut Dan blacked out, receiving some of the concussion of the exploding\r\nrocket. When his eyes snapped open he was floating like a feather in\r\nopen, airless space. His rubberoid space suit, living up to its rigid\r\ntests, had inflated to its elastic limit. But it held and within its\r\nautomatic units began feeding him oxygen, heat and radio-power. He had a\r\nchance, now, because he had been ejected cleanly from the rocket,\r\nwithout damage to the protective suit.\r\n\r\nThe stars wheeled dizzily around him. Dan finally saw the reason why. He\r\nwas not just floating as a free agent in space. He was circling the\r\nblack moonlet, at perhaps a thousand yards from its pitted surface.\r\n\r\n"Hello, Rough Rock," he called. "Still alive and kicking, sir. Only now,\r\nof all crazy-mad things, _I\'m_ a moon of _this_ moon! The collision must\r\nhave knocked me clear out of my down-to-Earth orbit.... I must have been\r\nejected in the same direction as the moonlet\'s course, in its gravity\r\nfield.... I don\'t know. Let an electronic brain figure it out some\r\ntime.... Anyway, now I\'m being dragged along in the orbit of the\r\nmoonlet--how about _that_? Yes, sir, I\'m circling down closer and closer\r\nto the moonlet.... No, don\'t worry, sir. It was a weak gravity pull,\r\nonly a fraction of an Earth-g. So I\'m drifting down gently as a\r\ncloud.... Stand by for my landing on Earth\'s second moon!"\r\n\r\nThe bloated figure in the bulging space suit circled the black stony\r\nsurface several more times, in a narrowing spiral, and finally landed\r\nwith a soft skidding bump that didn\'t even jar Dan\'s teeth. He bounced\r\nseveral times from a diminishing height of fifty-odd feet in grotesque\r\nslow-motion before he finally came to a stop.\r\n\r\nHe sat still for a moment, adjusting to the fantastic fact of being\r\nshipwrecked on an unchartered moonlet, crowding down his pulse rate\r\nwhich might be over ten percent normal now.\r\n\r\n"Okay, Rough Rock, I hear you.... You\'re telling me, sir?... Obviously,\r\nI\'m _marooned_ here. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
No rocket to leave with. No way to get back to\r\nterra firma ... what? If you\'ll pardon my saying so, sir, that\'s a silly\r\nquestion.... Of course I\'m scared! Scared green. Sorry about the rocket,\r\nsir, losing it for you.... Me, sir? Thank you, sir. But stop\r\napologizing, will you? I know you haven\'t got any duplicates of the VX-3\r\nready, no rescue rocket...."\r\n\r\nDan listened a moment longer then broke in roughly. "Oh, for Pete\'s\r\nsake, will you stop crying over me, sir? So I get mine here. I might\r\nhave gotten it over Berlin, too. Forget it--sir.

=== Chunk 5 ===
"\r\n\r\nDan grinned suddenly. "Look, what have I got to kick about? I\'ll go out\r\nin a flash of glory--at least one headline will put it that way--and\r\nI\'ll get credit in the history books as the man who discovered that\r\nEarth has _two_ moons! What more could I ask, really?

=== Chunk 6 ===
"\r\n\r\nDan blushed at the reply from Rough Rock. "Will you lay off please,\r\nColonel? How else should a man take it? I\'m still scared silly inside.\r\nBut, look, I\'ve really got something to report now. This little runt\r\nmoon makes tracks around Earth in probably two hours minus. If I\r\nremember my Spacenautics right I\'m already looking down over the Grand\r\nCanyon, heading west. I\'m going to get a pretty terrific bird\'s-eye view\r\nof the whole world in two more hours, which is just about how much\r\noxygen I\'ve got left.... Lucky, eh?"\r\n\r\nDan looked down, watching in fascination the majestic wheeling of the\r\nEarth below him. His little moonlet did not rotate, or rather it rotated\r\nonce for each revolution around Earth, as the Moon did, keeping one face\r\nearthward, giving him an uninterrupted view. The Sierras on Earth hove\r\ninto clear view and the broad Pacific. There would follow Hawaii, then\r\nJapan, Asia, Europe.... No, he saw he was slanting southwest. It would\r\nbe across the equator, past Australia, perhaps near the South Pole, then\r\nup around over the top of the world past Greenland, following that great\r\ncircle around the globe. In any case, his was the speediest trip around\r\nthe world ever made by man!\r\n\r\n"Before we\'re out of mutual range, Rough Rock, I\'m going to explore this\r\nnew moon. Me and Columbus! 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Stand by for reports."\r\n\r\nDan did his walking in huge leaps that propelled him fifty feet at a\r\nstep with slight effort, due to the extremely feeble gravity of the tiny\r\nbody. What did he weigh here? Probably no more than an ounce or two.\r\n\r\n"Nothing much to report, Colonel. It\'s a dead, airless pip-squeak\r\nplanetoid, just a big mile-thick rock, probably. No life, no vegetation,\r\nno people, no nothing. Guess you might call me the Man in the Second\r\nMoon--and the joke\'s on me! Well, one and three-quarter hours of oxygen\r\nleft, by the gauge, or 105 minutes--sounds like more that way.... What\'s\r\nthat, sir? Your voice is getting faint. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
Any last requests from me? Well,\r\none favor maybe. Pick up my body some day with another rocket.... Yeah,\r\nit\'ll stay preserved up here in this deep-freeze of space.... Thanks,\r\nsir.... Can\'t hear you much now. Going out of range. Give Betty my\r\nfondest. You know, the blonde.... Well, sir--goodbye now."\r\n\r\nDan was glad that Rough Rock\'s radio voice faded to a whispery\r\nnothingness. It wasn\'t easy to stay casual now. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
There was nothing more\r\nto say, really, and he didn\'t want to hear any more crying from the CO.\r\nThe Old Man had sounded almost hysterical. He wanted just to be alone\r\nwith his thoughts now, making his final peace with the universe....\r\n\r\nHe checked the gauge with his watch--ninety minutes of oxygen to zero.\r\nOr, he thought with a grin, eternity minus ninety minutes.\r\n\r\nHe was beginning to have trouble breathing. But it was awesomely grand,\r\nwatching the sweep of Earth beneath him, the procession of dots that\r\nwere islands strung across the Pacific South Seas like a necklace of\r\ngreen beads. He was still within radio range of ships below at sea. Yet\r\nhe didn\'t contact them. He had nothing to say, like a ghost in the sky.\r\n\r\nIdly, he kept pitching loose stones, watching their rifle-like speed\r\naway from him. Again a phenomenon of the weak gravity of the moonlet.\r\nActually, he was able to pick up a boulder ten feet across and heave it\r\naway with ease. _We who are about to die amuse ourselves_, he thought.\r\nThen, because a thread of stubborn hope still clung in a corner of his\r\nmind, he got an idea. It had lurked just beyond his mental grasp for\r\nsome time now. Something significant....\r\n\r\nAbruptly, face alight, Dan switched on his radio and contacted a ship\r\nbelow, asking them to relay him to Rough Rock with their more powerful\r\ntransmitter.\r\n\r\n"Ahoy, Rough Rock! Stop adding up my insurance, Colonel! I\'m coming\r\nback.... No, sir, I haven\'t gone out of my head, sir. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
It\'s so simple\r\nit\'s a laugh, sir.... See you in a few hours, sir!"\r\n\r\nAnd he did.\r\n\r\nDan grinned when they hauled his dripping form from the sea. Aboard the\r\nsearch plane they cut him out of the space suit to which was still\r\nattached his emergency twin parachute. But his helmet was gone, ripped\r\nloose, for Dan had been breathing fresh Earth air during the long\r\nparachute descent.\r\n\r\nThey stared at him as at a dead man come alive.\r\n\r\n"Impossible to escape?" He chuckled, repeating their babble. "That\'s\r\nwhat _I_ thought too, until I remembered those data tables on gravity\r\nand Escape Velocity and such--how, on the Moon, the Escape Velocity is\r\nmuch less than on Earth. And on that tiny second moon--well, my clue was\r\nwhen I threw a stone into the air _and it never came back_."\r\n\r\nDan gulped hot coffee.\r\n\r\n"I got off the moonlet myself then, got up to more than a mile above it\r\nwhere I was free of its feeble gravity. But I was still in the same\r\norbit circling Earth. I\'d have continued revolving as a human satellite\r\nforever, of course, but for this emergency gadget hooked to my belt."\r\n\r\nDan held up the metal gun with its empty tank and needle-nose half\r\nburned away.\r\n\r\n"Reaction pistol. Fires hydrazine and oxidizer, ordinary jet-rocket\r\nprinciple. Aiming it toward the stars, opposite earth, its reactive\r\nblasts shoved me Earthward, thanks to Newton. I needed a speed of about\r\none-half mile a second. The powerful little jet gun had only my small\r\nmass to shove in free space, without gravity or friction. That broke me\r\nfrom free-fall _around_ Earth to gravity-fall _toward_ Earth.\r\n\r\n"Then I spiraled down under gravity pull. I reached lung-filling air\r\ndensity just in time, before my oxygen gave out. One more danger was\r\nthat I began heating up like a meteor due to air friction. I flung out a\r\nprayer first, followed by my twin parachutes, designed for extreme\r\ninitial shock. They held. Slowed me to a paratrooper\'s drift the rest of\r\nthe way down."\r\n\r\n"Wait," a puzzled pilot objected. "Your story doesn\'t hang together.\r\n_How_ did you get off that moonlet? How did you get up there, a mile\r\nabove it, away from its gravity? There was nobody to throw _you_, like a\r\nstone."\r\n\r\n"I threw myself," said Dan. "First I ran as fast as I could, maybe\r\nhalfway around that moonlet, to get a good running start. And then--"\r\n\r\nDan Barstow\'s grin then was undoubtedly the biggest grin in history....\r\n\r\n"Well, then, since the feeble gravity couldn\'t pull me back again, what\r\nI really did was to _jump clear off that moon_."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ March 1954.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.
