SMITH\r\n\r\n                         ILLUSTRATED BY FREAS\r\n\r\n            Enright was coming home, which should have been\r\n           good, since he was the first Earthman ever to go\r\n          faster than light. But when he\'d been gone eighteen\r\n         months in a ship that was supplied for only ten days,\r\n            the authorities were just a trifle curious....\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n                      Rocket Stories, July 1953.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTest Pilot Billy Enright looked down at the Earth so far below and\r\ndecided that home had never looked so good to any man. He and his\r\nexperimental spacecraft had exceeded the speed of light, he had crossed\r\nthe monstrous gulf between stars, and for eighteen months Billy Enright\r\nhad walked upon the earth-like planet of another star. He had driven\r\nfaster, gone farther, and stayed away longer than any other human, and\r\nnow he was happy to be arrowing down towards Mother Earth and home.\r\n\r\nMingled excitement and joy tickled his stomach. There would be one\r\nroyal explosion when he called in for landing instructions; he was\r\ngoing to create as much fuss as Tom Sawyer had caused a couple of\r\nhundred years ago when he and his boys turned up at their own funeral\r\nservices. For Billy Enright had been overdue for eighteen months on a\r\nflight-plan calling for a twelve-hour program. He had probably been\r\nlisted as "Missing" for more than sixteen of the eighteen months.\r\n\r\nIt would be more dramatic if he just barrelled down unannounced and\r\nwalked in to the commandant\'s office with an air of unconcern. But\r\non the other hand, the story he had to tell about his flight and the\r\nexplanation of his overdue return wanted a large audience whose minds\r\nhad already recovered from the first shock. So instead of letting shock\r\npile upon shock, Billy Enright flipped the radio on and called:\r\n\r\n"Interstellar Spacecraft One calling Mojave Base, I.S.-1 calling\r\nMojave. Test Pilot Enright requesting landing instructions. I.S.-1\r\nover."\r\n\r\nForty seconds later--Enright was still so far from Earth that the\r\nradio waves took twenty seconds to travel in each direction--his\r\nreceiver chattered into life and an excited voice spluttered,\r\n"Billy Enright--where the--er--Mojave Operations to I.S.-1. Look,\r\nEnright--we--My God!"\r\n\r\nThere was an abrupt click and another, calmer voice took over. "Captain\r\nEnright from Mojave. Commodore Hogan here. Are you all right? Any\r\ndistress? 

=== Chunk 2 ===
Hogan over."\r\n\r\nEnright snapped the "talk" button and said: "Enright to Commodore\r\nHogan. Good morning, Commodore. I am not in distress. I am in more\r\nthan fine shape and glad to be coming in. Please slip me the landing\r\ninstructions so that I can kiss Mother Earth softly and gently and walk\r\naway from my ship, will you? Also will you please notify my parents\r\nthat I am all in one healthy piece and that I will be seeing them as\r\nsoon as I can? 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Enright over."\r\n\r\nBilly Enright spent the next forty seconds wondering what kind of a\r\nstew was going on down at Base. He made a mental bet that there were\r\nwires burning and tables being pounded.\r\n\r\nCommodore Hogan\'s voice came back. "Mojave to I.S.-1. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
You will land on\r\nRunway Nine. Ceiling and visibility unlimited. Wind Northeast at four\r\nmiles. Barometer twenty-nine point seven. Traffic: Luna Three taking\r\noff, one Orbital Station Shuttle in flight pattern. All other traffic\r\nbeing held. You will land, Captain Enright, and then you will seal your\r\nspacecraft for investigation and inventory. You will not log in at\r\nOperations, but present yourself to the Officer of the Day to deliver\r\nyour report and explanations. You will not converse with anyone or\r\ndiscuss your--ah, adventures, until you have been granted permission.\r\nConfirm this, Captain Enright. Hogan over."\r\n\r\nBilly grabbed the microphone and snapped, "Enright to Base. Look,\r\nCommodore, I confirm the landing instructions and will comply with\r\nthe personal orders, but aren\'t you overlooking the fact that an\r\nexperimental mission, undertaken with calculated risk, with success\r\nhighly controversial, cannot be subject to strict timetable? You sound\r\nas though I\'m being charged with awol." Enright pronounced the initial\r\nletters as a word.\r\n\r\nThe reply came, as formal as before. "Mojave to Enright. There has been\r\nno formal charge of being absent without official leave logged against\r\nyou, Captain Enright. All official action will be held in abeyance\r\nuntil your account has been reviewed by the Court of Inquiry, which\r\nwill convene upon your arrival. Mojave Operations, Commodore Hogan in\r\ncommand, over and off!"\r\n\r\nBilly Enright grunted. Commodore Hogan was a boiled collar and if he\r\nwanted to play this game as though he had caught one of his men buzzing\r\na State Capitol Building instead of being delayed on a mission across\r\nthe galaxy by half-a-hundred light years, then he, Billy Enright, was\r\nmore than willing to go along.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEnright set the interstellar spacecraft down on the runway without\r\na bump and rode the brakes to a stop. With a resentful flourish he\r\nparked his hat at an angle on his skull, ironed his cheerful features\r\ninto a mirthless stoneface, and left his ship. He sealed the spacelock\r\ncarefully. Then he dropped to the concrete parking block and waited for\r\nthe official spaceport car to come along the taxiway for him.\r\n\r\nThe driver greeted him with a grin. "Glad to see you back, Captain." He\r\nheld out a hand which Enright shook firmly. "How was it--out There?"\r\n\r\nThe other man in the car frowned and snapped, "Captain Enright, do not\r\nanswer! Mister Forrester, you will open and show me your right hand!"\r\n\r\nEnright grunted. He knew the other man and so he said, "Look, Tom, I\'m\r\nnot playing any games. Or should I address you as Executive Horne? I\r\ndid not pass Ed Forrester any notes, data, or pictures. I was merely\r\nshaking hands."\r\n\r\n"We\'re all under orders," said Horne. "And your orders are to say\r\nnothing to anybody. Even me."\r\n\r\n"Call me Captain Clam," said Billy Enright. "Is there any ruling\r\nagainst you passing me a cigarette?"\r\n\r\n"Er--Mister Forrester, you will witness this. I have been asked for a\r\ncigarette. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
I am going to comply. However, you will note carefully that\r\nCaptain Enright did light this cigarette and smoke it, thus burning its\r\ncontents and obviating any possible exchange of information from me to\r\nhim. Agreed?"\r\n\r\nEnright blurted: "What the hell am I, a prisoner of war?"\r\n\r\n"No comment. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Please follow your orders," said Executive Horne. He did\r\nhold out a lighter for Enright, who puffed deeply with appreciation.\r\nThe car delivered them to the Administration Building of Mojave\r\nSpaceport by the time Enright finished his smoke. He snubbed the butt\r\ncarefully and handed it to the driver, along with a small pile of gray\r\nash. "Preserve these remains, Mister Forrester. At least until I have\r\nbeen paroled. Affirmed, Executive Horne?"\r\n\r\n"Affirmed. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Now, come along, Captain."\r\n\r\nHe led Billy Enright into the building and upstairs, along a corridor\r\nand into a large conference room. Enright looked at a long table,\r\naround which were most of the big gold braid of Mojave Spaceport, a\r\ncouple of space admirals from his project--Operation Interstellar--and\r\nthree men in conservative business dress. The man at the head of the\r\ntable was Space Admiral Meldrum, who had been the first man to set a\r\nfoot on the Moon some forty years ago.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen, this is Captain William Enright, test pilot of the\r\nInterstellar Spacecraft One, Operation Interstellar. Captain Enright,\r\nthe Board of Inquiry." The admiral named them around the table. The\r\nonly one Billy knew was Commodore Hogan; the rest he only recognized\r\nby name, other than the top brass of his own project. He nodded\r\naffably, then Billy frowned and asked:\r\n\r\n"This looks formidably formal, sir. Am I to be represented by someone\r\nappointed in my favor?"\r\n\r\nAdmiral Meldrum shook his head. "This is no Court Military," he said.\r\n"This is a Court of Inquiry. You would have faced this court if you\r\nhad returned home on schedule, to deliver your report. There have been\r\nno charges made formally. If your explanation is adequate, there will\r\nbe none. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
This meeting will be informal. If you can show just cause\r\nfor returning eighteen months late from a twelve-hour mission, no\r\ncharges will be made. Now, Captain Enright, please deliver your report,\r\nbeginning at the beginning?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly. At 1200 hours, on 4 March 2014, I took off from the Earth\r\nin the first spacecraft capable of driving faster than the velocity of\r\nlight. I--"\r\n\r\n"One moment, Captain," asked one of the men in civilian dress. Enright\r\nblinked and saw that the man\'s name was Harness. E. D. Harness,\r\nSenator, Chairman of the Committee on Special Affairs and so forth.\r\nEnright nodded, and the senator went on: "My scientific knowledge is\r\nsketchy. I was taught that nothing can exceed the speed of light."\r\n\r\n"You were taught prior to Bergenholm\'s discovery of the nullification\r\nof mass," smiled Enright. "Mass increases, in accordance with\r\nEinstein\'s equations, as the velocity approaches the speed of light, so\r\nthat the mass becomes infinite when the velocity of light is reached.\r\nBut when mass is nullified, or reduced to zero--" Billy Enright spread\r\nhis hands amusedly, "--you can multiply it all night and a hundred\r\nbillion times zero is still zero."\r\n\r\n"And the drive?"\r\n\r\n"A standard reaction motor of the rocket type. Since the ship\'s mass is\r\nzero, its inertia is also zero and therefore the thrusting force of an\r\ninfant can move zero mass and inertia if need be."\r\n\r\nSenator Harness nodded. "Then with any kind of reaction thrust you\r\ncould achieve infinite velocity because the mass and inertia are zero?"\r\n\r\n"If we were passing through a completely unresisting medium, what you\r\nsay would be true. But even the deepest part of interstellar space\r\nstill contains a good many atoms per cubic centimeter. We found this\r\nalmost-perfect vacuum a resisting medium to a spacecraft going faster\r\nthan light."\r\n\r\n"And so what was your estimated velocity?"\r\n\r\n"About sixty-three light years per hour," replied Billy Enright.\r\n\r\nThe senator nodded as though he were satisfied, but he asked one more\r\nquestion: "Captain Enright, do you know the main purpose of your\r\nmission?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly. Until the discovery of the faster than light drive, mankind\r\nwas forever trapped on the Earth. One by one we have landed on the\r\nseveral planets and their satellites only to find them hopelessly\r\nairless, poisonous of atmosphere, utterly cold and inhospitable, or\r\ndeadly to human life in other ways. The explosive increase of Earth\'s\r\npopulation made it necessary to find another frontier, another hope\r\nfor colonization and expansion. The massless space drive offered this\r\nhope to us. My mission was to test the drive, to test the crossing of\r\ninterstellar space, and if at all possible return with some tale of\r\nhope."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCommodore Hogan grunted. "Must have been some sweet paradise you found,\r\nCaptain Enright."\r\n\r\nAdmiral Meldrum rapped the gavel on the table. "Please. No\r\npersonalities, Commodore. Why do you take that sarcastic tone? Captain\r\nEnright may have good reason for his delay, you know."\r\n\r\nThe commodore grunted again. "The I.S.-1 was stocked with only enough\r\nfood, water, and air for a trip of ten days\' duration. I ask you all,\r\nhow did Captain Enright sustain himself for an eighteen-month jaunt?\r\nUnless, of course, he landed and made himself at home for a year and a\r\nhalf. Or, he may be able to explain all about subjective and objective\r\ntime!" he snapped, whirling back to face Billy Enright.\r\n\r\nThe young spaceman shrugged. "No," he said. "The Einstein Equation of\r\ntime versus velocity is also obviated when mass is reduced to zero. No,\r\nCommander Hogan, I did not get involved with this at all.

=== Chunk 9 ===
"\r\n\r\n"You made no stop for repairs, no delay because of technical\r\ndifficulties?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Captain Enright, please outline your orders carefully."\r\n\r\nBilly Enright cleared his throat and took a sip of water. "At 1200\r\nhours I was to take off, heading for a small, insignificant Type G-Zero\r\ndwarf in Hercules, the exact coordinates I\'ve forgotten for the moment.\r\nThis star was selected over the more familiar celestial objects because\r\nit was closest to the Sun in size and radiation, and therefore many\r\nbelieved that it was most likely to have a set of planets similar to\r\nthe planets of Sol. I was to test the drive and make observations on\r\nthe process of exceeding the velocity of light, recording them. I was\r\nto approach this star--"\r\n\r\n"Sixty light years distant?" interrupted Commodore Hogan.\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"An hour\'s trip each way," said the commodore pointedly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"--I was to ascertain if this star had any planets, and if so, whether\r\nthere was one at about ninety million miles from the luminary. If this\r\nwas so, I was to approach and attempt to land. Then contingent upon the\r\nsuccess of the previous set of \'ifs\' I was to tackle the following.\r\nI was to take samples of the air and the water and the ground. I was\r\nto measure the temperature. I was to dig up a plant or two and I was\r\nto see if I could catch a small animal alive. I was to remain on that\r\nhypothetical planet for no longer than six hours. Then I was to take\r\noff and return to Earth.

=== Chunk 10 ===
"\r\n\r\n"I see. And in the case of emergency, either there or en route?"\r\n\r\n"I was to turn immediately and return to Earth."\r\n\r\n"And you did not."\r\n\r\n"Commodore, may I point out that mine was a mission of rather\r\nextraordinary nature? I was a volunteer. Willingly I put myself in a\r\nposition that no other man had ever been in before. I went into the\r\nDeep Unknown, across the limitless depths of galactic space, and my\r\nreturn was subject to considerable doubt. Now, the fact that I have\r\nreturned at all is in itself a statement of success, even though I may\r\nhave been delayed."\r\n\r\n"I am sorry, Captain Enright. But your statements have not yet given us\r\none reason for your delay. In fact, everything you have said indicates\r\nthat you could, at any time in the past eighteen months, have returned.\r\nInstead, you seem to have deliberately remained out of touch with the\r\npeople who entrusted you to perform a difficult mission."\r\n\r\nBilly Enright drawled, "Well, not exactly, Commodore. I did send an\r\nexplanatory message, but that was in deep space and I am afraid that\r\nthe radio waves will not reach the Earth for about fifteen years more."\r\n\r\nCommodore Hogan faced Admiral Meldrum. "I consider this to be\r\nrank insolence and insubordination. This man was entrusted with a\r\nbillion-dollar spacecraft, the first and so far the only one of its\r\nkind. It took five years of hard work to build it and another three\r\nyears to fit it out for its maiden trip. This Captain Enright went out\r\nwith the hopes and prayers of all mankind, but instead of following\r\norders he apparently went gallivanting all over the galaxy. I presume\r\nthat his idea was that his very return would cause us to forget his\r\nabsence for a year and a half. I--" Commodore Hogan whirled and faced\r\nBilly Enright. "Captain," he asked acidly, "did you take off as\r\nordered?"\r\n\r\n"I did."\r\n\r\n"And you did go into deep space on course?"\r\n\r\n"I did."\r\n\r\n"And you approached this star, found this hoped-for planet, landed,\r\nand--er--then was captured by some tribe of savages who kept you\r\nprisoner?"\r\n\r\n"Hardly. I did not reach my destination star and so I still do not know\r\nwhether it has any planets."\r\n\r\n"You were unavoidably detained?"\r\n\r\n"You can put it that way."\r\n\r\n"Suppose you tell us in what manner, before I ask that a formal charge\r\nof absent without official leave be logged against you."\r\n\r\nCaptain Enright nodded. "I took off under normal rocket take-off\r\nprocedure, dropping my first stage after nine minutes. At the start\r\nof the second stage, the mass-nullifying field was turned on,\r\nwhich brought my velocity up to the estimated constant velocity\r\nof sixty-three light years per hour. Once my velocity reached its\r\nconstant, I turned off the reaction motor to conserve fuel for my\r\nreturn, leaving only the tiniest trickle of power running from an\r\nauxiliary rocket to maintain speed. I made observations and recorded\r\nthem as directed.\r\n\r\n"Then," said Billy Enright, "when I was out about fifteen minutes, I\r\ncaught sight of a teardrop shaped spacecraft closing in from one side\r\nand catching up from behind. It was painted in bright enamel in panels.\r\nFrom the pointed tail there came a faint halo of pale blue light. It\r\ncaught up with me as though I were standing still, and as it came\r\nalongside, a bright green searchlight stabbed out and swept along my\r\nhull, stopping near my astrodome.\r\n\r\n"Then to my complete shock and dismay I heard a gruff voice snap: \'Pull\r\n\'er over to one side, Buster!\'\r\n\r\n"Wondering what to do, and how he could talk to me, I blubbered, \'Huh?\'\r\n\r\n"He said, \'Just pull her over and don\'t give me that _huh_ stuff.\'\r\n\r\n"I told him, \'But we\'re in free flight. I can\'t.\'\r\n\r\n"At this point he swore in an unintelligible voice and the green\r\nsearchlight turned to bright red. It must have been a tractor beam\r\nbecause he started hauling and I could see the stars spinning and I\r\ncould feel a definite deceleration forward that almost pulled me out of\r\nthe astrodome and into space itself. Then there was a metallic clink\r\nand in another half minute a tall man in polished leather came in and\r\nwaved me back to the pilot\'s chair.\r\n\r\n"\'Realize you were doing sixty?\'\r\n\r\n"\'Sixty?\'\r\n\r\n"\'Sixty light years per hour in a forty light zone. Let\'s see your\r\nlicense!\'\r\n\r\n"\'License?\' I asked blankly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"He pulled out a pad and started to scribble. \'Sixty lights in a forty\r\nlight zone and driving without a license. Boy, oh boy! 

=== Chunk 11 ===
Say! What kind\r\nof a crate is this anyway?\'\r\n\r\n"\'It\'s a standard reaction drive with mass nullifiers.\'\r\n\r\n"His eyes gleamed brighter. \'You know that free flight is just plain\r\ncoasting?\'\r\n\r\n"\'Of course,\' I said angrily.\r\n\r\n"\'Spacecraft running out of control," he said, scribbling some more.\r\n\r\n"\'But you can\'t do this to me,\' I cried.\r\n\r\n"The gleam in his eyes grew hard and scornful. \'Suppose you\'re the\r\nbest pal of the Sector Senator, play knolla with the Commissioner\r\nof Spacelanes, and will get me patrolling a beat along the Lesser\r\nMagellanic Cloud, huh?\' He looked down at his pad and grunted again.\r\n\'Better come with me,\' he said sourly. \'We couldn\'t accept your bail,\r\nwith no known address and not wearing a license. Boy, you\'ve had it!\'"\r\n\r\nCaptain Billy Enright took a deep breath and grinned. "No, gentlemen,\r\nmy delay was legal, not technical. They slipped me eighteen months, by\r\nthe time they\'d finished adding up the charges. I was not gallivanting,\r\nI was doing time at what they please to call \'Educational Labor.\'"\r\n\r\nEverybody looked a bit slack-jawed. Commodore Hogan leaped in front of\r\nBilly Enright and waved a finger under his nose.\r\n\r\n"Of all of the incredibly fantastic--" his voice failed. He took charge\r\nof himself. 

=== Chunk 12 ===
"You sent a radio message?" he asked calmly.\r\n\r\n"Yes. The whole thing is coming in via radio."\r\n\r\n"And you expect us to swallow this bucket of foul fish unsupported for\r\nthe next fifteen years? I suggest that you spend the intervening time\r\nin jail so we\'ll know where to send our apologies."\r\n\r\n"Won\'t be necessary," smiled Billy Enright. "I\'ve proof here." He\r\ndipped into his hip pocket and took out a small plastic folder. He\r\nflipped it open to display an ornate metal shield that glowed with some\r\ninner light completely beyond Earth science. He showed it around the\r\nconference table and then said, "Gentlemen, what they call \'Educational\r\nLabor\' means just that. Due to my incarceration for eighteen months, I\r\nhave qualified for the position of Sector Patrolman. And so help me,\r\nthe first man that tries deep space without qualifying for a license\r\ngets heaved into the clink. And whether or not this Human Race is going\r\nto be permitted to colonize our nearer stars depends only upon how\r\nfast we cotton to the idea of becoming a junior member of the Galactic\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\n"Good day, gentlemen."\r\n\r\nSector Patrolman Billy Enright walked out of the Board amid a stunned\r\nsilence. Home had never looked so good.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
