Most of the martini sloshed\r\nout over his robe. He jumped up, swabbing furiously at the spots.\r\n"Goddam it!"\r\n\r\n"Hank!" His wife slammed her book together.\r\n\r\n"Well, what do you expect? That confounded buzzer--"\r\n\r\n"--is a perfectly natural normal buzzer. You\'re just terribly upset,\r\ndear.

=== Chunk 2 ===
"\r\n\r\n"No," Mr. Ritchie said, "I am _not_ \'just terribly upset, dear\'--for\r\nseven years I\'ve been listening to that banshee\'s wail every time\r\nsomebody wants in. Well, I\'m through. Either it goes--"\r\n\r\n"All right, all _right_," Mrs. Ritchie said. "You don\'t have to make a\r\nproduction out of it."\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"Well what?"\r\n\r\nMr. Ritchie sighed ponderously, glared at his wife, set what was left\r\nof the martini down on a table and went to the door. He slipped the\r\nchain.\r\n\r\n"Be this the marster of \'arfway \'ouse?"\r\n\r\nMr. Ritchie opened the door. "Max--what the devil are you doing up at\r\nthis hour?"\r\n\r\nA large man, well built, in his forties, walked in, smiling. "I could\r\nask you the same question," he said, flinging his hat and scarf in the\r\ndirection of a chair, "but I\'m far too thoughtful."\r\n\r\nThey went back into the living room. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Mrs. Ritchie looked up, frowned.\r\n"Oh, swell," she said. "Dandy. All we need now is a bridge four."\r\n\r\n"Ruth\'s just terribly upset," Mr. Ritchie said.\r\n\r\n"Well," the large man said, "it\'s nice to see unanimity in this house\r\nfor once anyway. Hi, Ruth." He walked over to the bar and found the\r\nmartini mix and drained the jar\'s contents into a glass. Then he\r\ndrained the glass.\r\n\r\n"Hey, take it easy!"\r\n\r\nMax Kaplan turned to face his hosts. He looked quite a bit older than\r\nusual: the grin wasn\'t boyish now. "Dear folkses," he said, "when I\r\ndie, I don\'t want to see any full bottles around."\r\n\r\n"Oh, ha-ha, that\'s just so very deliriously funny," Mrs. Ritchie said.\r\nShe was massaging her temples.\r\n\r\n"I am glad to see her ladyship amused." Kaplan followed Mr. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Ritchie\'s\r\ngaze. "Hickory dickory dock, the mice looked at the clock...."\r\n\r\n"Oh, shut up."\r\n\r\n"Oop, sorry." The big man mixed up a new batch silently, then refilled\r\nthe three glasses. He sat down. The clock\'s tick, a deep sharp bass\r\nsound, got louder and louder in the room. Kaplan rested his head on the\r\ncouch arm. "Less than an hour," he said. "Not even an hour--"\r\n\r\n"I knew it." Mrs. Ritchie stood up. "I knew it the minute you walked\r\nin. We\'re not nervous enough, oh, no, now we\'ve got to listen to the\r\ngreat city editor and his news behind the news."\r\n\r\n"Very well!" 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Kaplan rose shakily. He was drunk; it showed now. "If I\'m\r\nnot welcome here, then I shall go elsewhere to breathe my last."\r\n\r\n"Never mind," Mrs. Ritchie said. "Sit down. I\'ve had a stomach full of\r\nthis wake. If you two insist on sitting up until X-hour like a couple\r\nof ghouls, well, that\'s your business. I\'m going to bed. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
And to sleep."\r\n\r\n"What a woman," Kaplan muttered, polishing off the martini. "Nerves of\r\nchilled steel."\r\n\r\nMrs. Ritchie looked at her husband for a moment. Then she said, "Good\r\nnight, dear," and started for the door.\r\n\r\n"See you in the morning," Mr. Ritchie said. "Get a good sleep."\r\n\r\nThen Max Kaplan giggled. "Yeah, a real good sleep."\r\n\r\nMrs. Ritchie left the room.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe big man fumbled for a cigarette. He glanced at the clock. "Hank,\r\nfor Chrissake--"\r\n\r\nHenry Ritchie sighed and slumped in the chair. "I tried, Max."\r\n\r\n"Did you? Did you try--I mean with everything?"\r\n\r\n"With everything. Might as well face it: the boy\'s going to burn, right\r\non schedule."\r\n\r\nKaplan opened his mouth.\r\n\r\n"Forget it. The governor isn\'t about to issue a commutation. With the\r\npublic\'s blood up the way it is, he knows what it would mean to his\r\nvote. We were stupid even to try."\r\n\r\n"Lousy vultures."\r\n\r\nRitchie shrugged. "They\'re hungry, Max. You forget, there hasn\'t been\r\nan execution in this state for over two years. They\'re hungry."\r\n\r\n"So a poor dumb kid\'s got to fry alive in order for them to get their\r\nkicks...."\r\n\r\n"Wait a second now. Don\'t get carried away. This same poor dumb kid is\r\nthe boy who killed George Sanderson in cold blood and then raped his\r\nwife, not too very long ago. If I recall, your word for him then was\r\nBrutal Murderer."\r\n\r\n"That was the paper. This is you and me."\r\n\r\n"Well, get that accusatory look off your face. Murder and rape--those\r\nare stiff raps to beat, pal."\r\n\r\n"You did it with Beatty, you got him off," Kaplan reminded his friend.\r\n\r\n"Luck. Public mood--Beatty was an old man, feeble. Look, Max--why don\'t\r\nyou stop beating around the bush?"\r\n\r\n"Okay," Kaplan said slowly. "They--let me in this afternoon. I talked\r\nwith him again."\r\n\r\nRitchie nodded. "And?"\r\n\r\n"Hank, I\'m telling you--it gives me the creeps. I swear it does.

=== Chunk 7 ===
"\r\n\r\n"What did he tell you?"\r\n\r\nKaplan puffed on his cigarette nervously, kept his eyes on the clock.\r\n"He was lying down when I went in, curled up tight. Trying to sleep."\r\n\r\n"Go on."\r\n\r\n"When he heard me, he came to. \'Mr. Kaplan,\' he says, \'you\'ve got to\r\nmake them believe me, you\'ve got to make them understand--\' His eyes\r\ngot real big then, and--Hank, I\'m scared."\r\n\r\n"Of what?

=== Chunk 8 ===
"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. Just him, maybe. I\'m not sure."\r\n\r\n"He carrying the same line?"\r\n\r\n"Yeah. But worse this time, more intense somehow...."\r\n\r\nRitchie tried to keep the smile. He remembered, all right. Much too\r\nwell. The whole story was crazy, normally enough to get the kid off\r\nwith a life sentence in the criminally insane ward. But it was a little\r\n_too_ crazy, so the psychiatrists wouldn\'t buy.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t get his words out of my mind," Kaplan was saying. His eyes were\r\nclosed. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
"\'Mister, tell them, tell them. If you kill me, then you\'ll all\r\ndie. This whole world of yours will die....\'"\r\n\r\n_Because_, Ritchie remembered, _you don\'t exist, any of you, except in\r\nmy mind. Don\'t you see? I\'m asleep and dreaming all this. You, your\r\nwives, your children, it\'s all part of my dream--and when you kill me\r\nthen I\'ll wake up and that will be the end of you...._\r\n\r\n"Well," Ritchie said, "it\'s original."\r\n\r\nKaplan shook his head.\r\n\r\n"Come on, Max, snap out of it. You act like you never listened to a\r\nlunatic before. People have been predicting the end of the world ever\r\nsince Year 1."\r\n\r\n"Sure, I know. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
You don\'t have to patronize me. It\'s just that--well,\r\nwho _is_ this particular lunatic anyway? We don\'t know any more about\r\nhim than the day he was caught. Even the name we had to make up. Who is\r\nhe, where\'d he come from, what\'s his home?"\r\n\r\n_My home ... a world of eternities, an eternity of worlds.... I must\r\ndestroy, hurt, kill before I wake always ... and then once more I must\r\nsleep ... always, always...._\r\n\r\n"Look, there\'s a hundred vagrants in every city. Just like our boy: no\r\nname, no friends, no relatives."\r\n\r\n"Then he doesn\'t seem in the least odd to you, is that it? Is that what\r\nyou\'re telling me?"\r\n\r\n"So he\'s odd! I never met a murderer that wasn\'t!" Ritchie recalled the\r\nlean hairless face, the expressionless eyes, the slender youthful body\r\nthat moved in strange hesitant jerks, the halting voice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe clock bonged the quarter hour. Fifteen to twelve. Max Kaplan wiped\r\nthe perspiration from his forehead.\r\n\r\n"And besides," Ritchie said, somewhat too loudly, "it\'s plain\r\nridiculous. He says--what? 

=== Chunk 11 ===
We\'re a dream he\'s having, right? Okay--then\r\nwhat about our parents, and their parents, everybody who never heard of\r\nthe kid?"\r\n\r\n"First thing I thought of. 

=== Chunk 12 ===
And you know his answer."\r\n\r\nRitchie snorted.\r\n\r\n"Well, think it over, for God\'s sake. He says _every_ dream is a\r\ncomplete unit in itself. You--haven\'t you ever had nightmares about\r\npeople you\'d never seen before?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I suppose so, but--"\r\n\r\n"All right, even though they were projections of your subconscious--or\r\nwhatever the hell it\'s called--they were complete, weren\'t they? Going\r\nsomewhere, doing something, all on their own?"\r\n\r\nRitchie was silent.\r\n\r\n"Where were they going, what were they doing? See? The kid says every\r\ndream, even ours, builds its own whole world--complete, with a past\r\nand--as long as you stay asleep--a future."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense! What about _us_, when _we_ sleep and dream? Or is the period\r\nwhen we\'re unconscious the time _he\'s_ up and around? And keep in mind\r\nthat everybody doesn\'t sleep at the same time--"\r\n\r\n"You\'re missing the point, Hank. I said it was complete, didn\'t I? And\r\nisn\'t sleeping part of the pattern?"\r\n\r\n"Have another drink, Max. You\'re slipping."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_"What will you wake up to?"_\r\n\r\n"_My home. You would not understand._"\r\n\r\n"_Then what?_"\r\n\r\n"_Then I sleep again and dream another world._"\r\n\r\n"_Why did you kill George Sanderson?_"\r\n\r\n"_It is my eternal destiny to kill and suffer punishment._"\r\n\r\n"_Why?_ Why?"\r\n\r\n"_In my world I committed a crime; it is the punishment of my world,\r\nthis destiny...._"\r\n\r\n"Then try this on for size," Ritchie said. "That kid\'s frozen stiff\r\nwith fear. Since he\'s going to have to wake up no matter what, then\r\nwhy not sit back and enjoy it?"\r\n\r\nKaplan\'s eyes widened. "Hank, how soundly do you sleep?"\r\n\r\n"What\'s that got to do with it?"\r\n\r\n"I mean, do you ever dream?"\r\n\r\n"Of course."\r\n\r\n"Ever get hold of any particularly vivid ones? Falling down stairs\r\nlike, being tortured, anything like that?"\r\n\r\nRitchie pulled at his drink.\r\n\r\n"Sure you have." Kaplan gazed steadily at the clock. Almost midnight.\r\n"Then try to remember. In that kind of dream, isn\'t it true that the\r\npleasure--or pain--you feel is almost as real as if you were actually\r\nexperiencing it? I remember once I had a nightmare about my old man.\r\nHe caught me in the basement with a cigarette--I was eight or nine,\r\nI guess. He took down my pants and started after me with his belt.\r\nHank--that hurt, bad. It really hurt."\r\n\r\n"So what\'s the point?"\r\n\r\n"In my dream I tried to get away from my old man. He chased me all over\r\nthat basement. Well, it\'s the same with the kid--except his dream is a\r\nhundred times more vivid, that\'s all. He knows he\'ll feel that electric\r\nchair, feel the jolts frying into him, feel the death boiling up in\r\nhis throat just as much as if he were honest-to-God sitting there...."\r\n\r\nKaplan stopped talking. The two men sat quietly watching the clock\'s\r\ninvisible progress. Then Ritchie leaped up and stalked over to the bar\r\nagain. "Doggone you, Max," he called. "You\'re getting _me_ fidgety now."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t kid me," Kaplan said. "You\'ve been fidgety on your own for\r\nquite a while. I don\'t know how you ever made the grade as a criminal\r\nlawyer--you don\'t know the first thing about lying."\r\n\r\nRitchie didn\'t answer. He poured the drink slowly.\r\n\r\n"Look at you and Ruth, screaming at each other. And then there was the\r\nother tip-off. The way you defended the kid--brilliantly, masterfully.\r\nYou\'d never have done that for a common open-and-shut little killer."\r\n\r\n"Max," Ritchie said, "you\'re nuts. Tell you what: at exactly 12:01 I\'ll\r\ntake you out for the biggest, juiciest, rarest steak you ever saw. On\r\nme. Then we\'ll get loaded and fall all over ourselves laughing--"\r\n\r\nRitchie fought away the sudden picture of steak, rare steak, with the\r\nblood sputtering out, sizzling on an electric stove.\r\n\r\nThe clock began to strike. Henry Ritchie and Max Kaplan stood very\r\nstill.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe uncoiled. The dry pop of hardened joints jabbed wakefulness into him\r\nuntil finally the twenty-foot long shell lay straight upon the steaming\r\nrocks. He opened his eyes, all of them, one by one.\r\n\r\nAcross the bubbling pools, far away, past the white stone geysers, he\r\ncould see them coming. Many of them, swiftly, giant slithering things\r\nwith many arms and many legs.\r\n\r\nHe tried to move, but rock grew over him and he could not move. By\r\nlooking around he could see the cliff\'s edge, and he remembered the\r\nthousand bottomless pits below. Gradually the rest formed, and he\r\nremembered all.\r\n\r\nHe turned to the largest creature. "Did you tell them?" He knew this\r\nwould be a horrible punishment, worse than the last, the burning, far\r\nworse. Fingers began to unhinge the thick shell, peel it from him,\r\nleaving the viscous white tenderness bare to the heat and pain. "Tell\r\nthem, make them understand, this is only a dream I\'m having--"\r\n\r\nThey took the prisoner to the precipice, lingered a moment to give him\r\na view of the dizziness and the sucking things far below. Then nervous\r\nhands pressed him forward into space.\r\n\r\nHe did not wake for a long time.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
