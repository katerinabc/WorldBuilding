The men who will seek to alter the status quo will be\r\n    called "robot lovers" and stoned. But what happens next?_\r\n\r\n\r\n benefactor\r\n\r\n _by ... George H. Smith_\r\n\r\n\r\n He clutched at the lever with more force than he\'d\r\n intended. It was set for further in the future....\r\n\r\n\r\n"They\'re crazy! 

=== Chunk 2 ===
They\'re insane! That mob outside is made up of madmen,"\r\nJacob Clark told his young assistant, Bill Towney.\r\n\r\n"They\'ll be battering at the door any minute now, sir," Towney said\r\nnervously.\r\n\r\n"But why? Why are they doing it? 

=== Chunk 3 ===
My inventions have advanced the world a\r\nhundred years. I\'ve always been a benefactor of man, not a destroyer."\r\n\r\n"It\'s the robots. People are in a rage because they say the robots cause\r\nunemployment by replacing workers."\r\n\r\n"It\'s utter nonsense, you know," Clark said impatiently. "Why can\'t they\r\nsee that my intelligent, self-controlled robots are the greatest boon\r\nthe human race has ever received from one man?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, sir, but they don\'t." Towney paused as the shouting and\r\npounding outside became more intense. "They demanded that you take the\r\nrobots out of the labor market and order your factories to stop making\r\nthem. This is the result of your refusal."\r\n\r\n"DOWN WITH CLARK! DOWN WITH THE TIN MEN! 

=== Chunk 4 ===
DEATH TO THE ROBOT LOVERS!"\r\nThe furious mob was battering at the door now.\r\n\r\n"Really, sir," Towney said, "you should leave here. They\'ll kill you if\r\nyou don\'t!"\r\n\r\n"Leave here? I should say not. I\'ll defy the fools. I\'ll tell them what\r\nI\'ve done for them and make them understand." He glanced nervously at\r\nthe door. "Besides there\'s only one door. I couldn\'t get away now."\r\n\r\n"There\'s the time machine, sir."\r\n\r\n"But isn\'t there some other way? Perhaps if you went out and talked to\r\nthem...."\r\n\r\n"You know there\'s no other way. Those people believe you\'ve brought\r\ndisaster to the human race and they mean to kill you. And if you don\'t\r\nhurry they will," Towney said urgently. "The time machine is set for\r\ntwenty years in the future. Please hurry, sir!"\r\n\r\nThe door was beginning to give. Clark looked around unhappily and then\r\nwalked to the time machine. "All right, I\'ll go. In the future I know\r\nthe results of my work will be appreciated. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
I\'ll be a hero and\r\nbenefactor of mankind."\r\n\r\nTowney heard the door crash and roughly pushed his employer into the\r\ntime machine as the mob burst through. "Push the starting button, push\r\nthe starting button. Quick!" he screamed as the first of the mob reached\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nClark\'s hand leaped to the control lever just as a brick crashed into\r\nhis head. His hand completed its motion with more force than he had\r\nintended as he sank unconscious to the floor and the machine was set for\r\na thousand years in the future instead of twenty.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe year three thousand had been a brilliant one for the robots, in\r\nfact, the most brilliant since the last human being had died some five\r\nhundred years before. They had reached Venus and Mars and were now\r\nplanning a trip to Jupiter. And this very day, a huge statue of Jacob\r\nClark, the creator and benefactor, was to be dedicated on the site of\r\nwhat once had been his laboratory. It seemed a shame that most of the\r\nrecords concerning him and his time had been lost in one of the great\r\nwars that had helped to extinguish the humans. The statue though was\r\ngood for surely he looked like a robot. One of the few human books still\r\nin existence said that the Creator had created in his own image.\r\n\r\nIt was right at the foot of his own statue that the Guardians of the\r\nShrine found Jacob Clark. They picked up his unconscious, bleeding body\r\nand laid it tenderly on a nearby bench. They bent over him with all the\r\ngentleness and solicitude that had been installed in his very first\r\nmodels and had been handed down from generation to generation of robots.\r\nThey wanted to help him but they were very puzzled.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it came from a far part of the earth," one of them said.\r\n\r\n"Or maybe a mistake was made at one of the birth factories," said\r\nanother. "See, it is losing oil at a great rate."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps," mused the elder, "it is a new model. At any rate it is a\r\nrobot and has been damaged. As our great creator taught us, he must be\r\naided. We will take it to the central repair factory in the city."\r\n\r\n"But," the first robot protested, "it\'s awfully bulky to be carried so\r\nfar."\r\n\r\nBeing creatures of logic, they thought about it for a moment and then\r\nthe elder came to a decision that was both effective and reasonable.\r\n\r\n"Since he is so bulky, we will disassemble him for transportation\r\npurposes," he said as he leaned over and gently twisted off Clark\'s\r\nright arm.\r\n\r\n"Rather primitive and messy construction, I\'d say," said the second\r\nrobot as he tenderly unscrewed Jacob Clark\'s head from his body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ August 1958.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.
