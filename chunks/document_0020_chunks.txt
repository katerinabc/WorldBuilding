But they were pretty slow\r\ncoming in this time."\r\n\r\nThe doctor looked up quizzically, "Is that the only reason you think you\r\nmight need a booster shot?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no ... of course not!" 

=== Chunk 3 ===
The man leaned forward and placed one hand,\r\npalm up, on the desk. "Last year I had an accident ... stupid ... lost a\r\nthumb." He shrugged apologetically, "It took almost six months to grow\r\nback."\r\n\r\nThoughtfully, the doctor leaned back in his chair, "Hm-m-m ... I see."\r\nAs the man before him made an involuntary movement toward his pocket,\r\nthe doctor smiled, "Go on, smoke if you want to." Picking up the chart,\r\nhe murmured, "Six months ... much too long. Strange we didn\'t catch that\r\nat the time." He read silently for a few moments, then began to fill out\r\na form clipped to the folder. "Well, I think you probably are due for\r\nanother booster about now. There\'ll have to be the usual tests.

Not that\r\nthere\'s much doubt ... we like to be certain."\r\n\r\nThe middle-aged man seemed relieved. Then, on second thought, he\r\nhesitated uneasily, "Why? Is there any danger?"\r\n\r\nAmusement flickered across the doctor\'s face, turned smoothly into a\r\nreassuring half-smile. "Oh, no. There\'s absolutely no danger involved.\r\nNone at all. We have tissue-regeneration pretty well under control now.\r\nStill, I\'m sure you understand that accurate records and data are very\r\nnecessary to further research and progress."\r\n\r\nReassured, the patient thawed and became confidential, "I see. Well, I\r\nsuppose it\'s kinda silly, but I don\'t much like shots. It\'s not that\r\nthey hurt ... it\'s just that I guess I\'m old-fashioned. I still feel\r\nkinda \'creepy\' about the whole business." Slightly embarrassed, he\r\npaused and asked defensively, "Is that unusual?"\r\n\r\nThe doctor smiled openly now, "Not at all, not at all. Things have moved\r\npretty fast in the past few years. I suppose it takes people\'s emotional\r\nreactions a while to catch up with developments that, logically, we\r\naccept as matter of fact."\r\n\r\nHe pushed his chair back from the desk, "Maybe it\'s not too hard to\r\nunderstand. Take \'fire\' for example: Man lived in fear of fire for a\r\ngood many hundred-thousand years--and rightly so, because he hadn\'t\r\nlearned to control it. The principle\'s the same; First you learn to\r\nprotect yourself from a thing; then control it; and, eventually, we\r\nlearn to \'harness\' it for a useful purpose." He gestured toward the\r\nman\'s cigarette, "Even so, man still instinctively fears fire--even\r\nwhile he uses it. In the case of tissue-regeneration, where the change\r\ntook place so rapidly, in just a generation or so, that instinctive fear\r\nis even more understandable--although quite as unjustified, I assure\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nThe doctor stood up, indicating that the session was ending. While his\r\npatient scrambled to his feet, hastily putting out his cigarette, the\r\nphysician came around the desk. He put his hand on the man\'s shoulder,\r\n"Relax, take it easy--nothing to worry about. This is a wonderful age we\r\nlive in. Barring a really major accident, there\'s no reason why you\r\nshouldn\'t live at least another seventy-five years. After all, that\'s a\r\nvery remarkable viral-complex we have doing your \'repair\' work."\r\n\r\nAs they walked to the door, the man shook his head, "Guess you\'re right,\r\nDoc. It\'s certainly done a good job so far, and I guess you specialists\r\nknow what you\'re doing, even if folks don\'t understand it."\r\n\r\nAt the door he paused and half turned to the doctor, "But say ...\r\nsomething I meant to ask you. This \'stuff\' ... er, this vaccine ...\r\nwhere did it come from? Seems to me I heard somewhere that, way back\r\nbefore you fellows got it \'tamed\' it was something else--dangerous.\r\nThere was another name for it. Do you know what I mean?"\r\n\r\nThe doctor\'s hand tightened on the doorknob. "Yes, I know," he said\r\ngrimly, "but not many laymen remember. Just keep in mind what I told\r\nyou. With any of these things, the pattern is protection, then control,\r\nthen useful application." He turned to face his patient, "Back in the\r\ndays before we put it to work for us--rebuilding tissue, almost ending\r\naging and disease--the active basis for our vaccine caused a whole group\r\nof diseases, in itself."\r\n\r\nReturning the man\'s searching gaze, the doctor opened the door, "We\'ve\r\ncome a long way since then. You see," he said quietly, "in those days\r\nthey called it \'cancer\'."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Analog_ September 1962.
