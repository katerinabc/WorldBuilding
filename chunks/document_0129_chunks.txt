Good old Chet, best man in Accounting. Six feet tall,\r\nbrown hair, brown eyes. Full of vim and vigor, that was good old Chet.\r\n\r\n"God!" he screamed. "They\'re strangling me, the skunks!" He rose from\r\nbed, his face dripping with sweat and his hands trembling like a\r\nfrightened child\'s. "They\'re killing me!" He ran to the bathroom and\r\nvomited. His wife was standing by the door when he finished, but he\r\nwalked past her as if she didn\'t exist.\r\n\r\n"Why, Chester! What\'s the matter with you?" she asked, trailing him\r\ninto the bedroom. "I\'ve never heard you talk like that before!" For a\r\nmoment she stood watching him in numb silence. "For goodness\' sake,\r\nChester, why are you getting dressed at three o\'clock in the morning?"\r\n\r\n"None of your business," he mumbled, setting a firm upper lip and\r\ngazing at her with lizard-cold Marlon Brando eyes. He picked up his\r\ntie, laughed at it with careless ease and threw it across the room.\r\n"See you around, baby," he hissed, zipping up his trousers and walking\r\npast her.\r\n\r\n"Chester McRae! Where are you going at this time of night? 

=== Chunk 2 ===
You\'ve got\r\nto go to work tomorrow! Don\'t you love me any more? Chester...."\r\n\r\nBut her words echoed emptily through Chester McRae\'s pleasant little\r\nsuburban home. Chester was no longer present.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBartholomew Oliver. Good old Barth, best man on a duck hunt since\r\nthe guy who invented shotguns. Five foot ten, weak chin, gambler\'s\r\nmustache. Good man with small-town girls, too.\r\n\r\n"Hey, Thelma," he said. "You know what I think?

"\r\n\r\n"Go to sleep."\r\n\r\n"I think it\'d be funnier than hell if I left you flat."\r\n\r\n"What kind of wisecrack is that? And what do you think you\'re doing?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m getting dressed...."\r\n\r\n"It\'s three o\'clock in the morning."\r\n\r\n"So? I don\'t give a damn."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll come back.

Drunken louse."\r\n\r\nHe laughed softly and smiled at her in the darkness with ice-white\r\nMarlon Brando teeth. Then he was gone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOswald Williams. Good old Ozzie, best man in the whole philosophy\r\ndepartment. Five foot two, one hundred and seven pounds, milky eyes.\r\nWrote an outstanding paper on the inherent fallacies of logical\r\npositivism.\r\n\r\n"Louise," he whispered, "I feel uneasy. Very uneasy."\r\n\r\nHis wife lifted her fatty head and gazed happily down at Oswald. "Go to\r\nsleep," she said.\r\n\r\n"If you\'ll excuse me, I think that I shall take a walk."\r\n\r\n"But, Oswald, it\'s three o\'clock in the morning!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be irrational," he whispered. "If I want to take a walk, I shall\r\ntake a walk."\r\n\r\n"Well! I don\'t think you ought to, or you might catch a cold."\r\n\r\nHe rose and dressed, donning a tee-shirt and tweed trousers. With\r\nsnake-swift Marlon Brando hands, he tossed his plaid scarf in her face.\r\n\r\n"Excuse me, Louise," he whispered, "but I gotta make it...."\r\n\r\nThen, laughing softly, he strode from the room.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt three o\'clock in the morning, even a large city is quiet and dark\r\nand almost dead. At times, the city twitches in its sleep; occasionally\r\nit rolls over or mutters to itself. But only rarely is its slumber\r\nshattered by a scream....\r\n\r\n"Johnny! Hey, Johnny!" cries Chester McRae, his eyes as dull and\r\npoisonous as two tiny toads.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s make it, man ... let\'s split...." whispers Bartholomew Oliver,\r\none finger brushing his nose like a rattler nosing a dead mouse.\r\n\r\n"I don make no move without my boys," says Oswald Williams, his hands\r\ncurled like scorpion tails.\r\n\r\nTogether they walk down the street, moving with slow insolence,\r\ntheir lips curled in snarls or slack with indifference, their eyes\r\nglittering with hidden hatreds. But they are not alone in the city.\r\nThe college boys are coming, in their dirty jeans and beer-stained\r\ntee-shirts; so too are the lawyers, in dusty jackets and leather pants;\r\nso come the doctors and the businessmen, on stolen motorcycles; the\r\nbricklayers and gas station attendants, the beatniks and dope pushers,\r\nthe bankers and lifesaving instructors, the butchers, the bakers, the\r\ncandlestick makers... they are all coming, flocking into the city for\r\nreasons not their own, wandering in twos and threes and twenties, all\r\nof them sullen and quiet, all of them shuffling beneath darkly-hued\r\nclouds of ill intent, all of them proud and deadly and virile, filling\r\nthe streets by the thousands now, turning the streets into rivers of\r\nflesh....\r\n\r\n"Hey, Johnny," says Chester, "let\'s cool this dump."\r\n\r\n"Man, let\'s make it with the skirts," says Bartholomew.\r\n\r\n"I don see no skirts," says Chester.\r\n\r\n"You pig," snarls Ozzie.\r\n\r\nThe mob is monstrous now, like a pride of lion cubs, beyond count in\r\ntheir number, without equal in their leonine strength, above the common\r\nquick in their immortal pride, milling through the hot black veldt,\r\nswarming in the city streets. Millions of them, more than the eye can\r\nsee or the mind can bear. It seems that no man sleeps, that every male\r\nin the great city must walk tonight.\r\n\r\n"Johnny," says Chester, "I don dig no chicks on the turf."\r\n\r\n"Eeee, colay. What a drag," whispers Bartholomew.\r\n\r\n"You goddam logical positivist," snarls Ozzie.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn uneasy sound ripples through the mob, like the angry hiss of an\r\ninjured ego, moving from street to street and swelling upward in a\r\nsudden, angry roar ... they want their women, the dance-hall girls,\r\nthe young waitresses, the nowhere chicks in five dollar dresses,\r\nthe Spanish girls with eyes as dark as the Spanish night. And then,\r\nas though by accident, one man looks up at the starry sky and sees\r\n_her_--sees her standing on a balcony far above them, twenty stories\r\nabove them, up where the wind can blow her hair and billow her blue\r\ndress like an orchid of the night.\r\n\r\nShe laughs gently, without fear, gazing down at the mindless mob of\r\nrebels.\r\n\r\nThey laugh too, just as gently, their quiet eyes crawling over the\r\nsight of her body, far above.\r\n\r\n"Thass my chick," whispers Chester.\r\n\r\n"Cool it, daddy," says Bartholomew, slipping into a pair of dark\r\nglasses and touching his lips with the tip of his tongue. "That skirt\r\nis private property.

"\r\n\r\n"You boys may walk and talk," says Ozzie, "but you don play. You don\r\nplay with Rio\'s girl."\r\n\r\nSuddenly, angry words and clenched fists erupt from the proud, quiet\r\nmillions that flood the streets. Suddenly, a roar like the roar of\r\nlions rises up and buffets the girl in blue, the girl on the balcony.\r\nShe laughs again, for she knows that they are fighting for her.\r\n\r\nA figure appears on the balcony, next to the girl. The figure is a man,\r\nand he too is dressed in blue. Suddenly, just as suddenly as it began,\r\nthe fighting ceases.\r\n\r\n"My God," whispers Chester, his cheeks gone pale, "what am I doing out\r\nhere?"\r\n\r\n"Maybe I got the D.T.s," whispers Bartholomew, "but maybe I don\'t...."\r\nHe sits down on the curb and rubs his head in disbelief.\r\n\r\nOswald does not speak. His shame is the greatest. He slinks into the\r\ndarkness of an alley and briefly wishes for an overcoat.\r\n\r\nThe pride of lion cubs has been routed, and now they scatter, each one\r\nscrambling for his private den of security, each one lost in a wild and\r\nnameless fear. In twos and threes and twenties they rush back to their\r\nhomes, their wives, their endless lives.\r\n\r\nFar above, in the apartment with the balcony, a man in blue is chiding\r\na girl in blue.\r\n\r\n"That was scarcely reasonable, Dorothy."\r\n\r\n"But Daddy, you promised to let me have them for the entire night!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but...."\r\n\r\n"I wasn\'t really going to let them hurt themselves! Really, I wasn\'t!

=== Chunk 6 ===
"\r\n\r\n"But, Dorothy--you know these things can get out of hand."\r\n\r\n"Oh, but Daddy, you know how I adore strong, quiet, proud men.\r\nRebellious men like Marlon."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and you know how _I_ adore order and peace. There shall be _no_\r\nmore riots! And tomorrow our little puppets shall go back to their\r\n\'dull\' lives, as you so wittily put it, and everything shall be as I\r\nwish."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThree hours later, Chester McRae arose at the sound of the alarm,\r\ndressed in a stupor and stumbled into his kitchen for breakfast.\r\n\r\n"My goodness, Chester," said his wife, who had already arisen, "you\r\nlook grouchier than usual! Ha, ha!"\r\n\r\nHe smiled wanly and opened the morning paper.\r\n\r\nHalfway across town, Bartholomew Oliver was still asleep, casually lost\r\nin the pleasures of an erotic dream. But Professor Oswald Williams, his\r\ntiny jaw unshaven and his eager eyes shot through with fatigue, had\r\nbeen hard at work for three hours, scribbling down his latest exposure\r\nof the logical positivists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s 1,492,633 Marlon Brandos, by Vance Aandahl\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
