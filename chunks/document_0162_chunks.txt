But a few more\r\n     incisive cameos of fantasy such as this, and Mr. Anderson may come\r\n     to be identified as Karen\'s husband._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe edge of the world is fenced off stoutly enough, but the fence isn\'t\r\nmade that will stop a boy. Johnny tossed his pack and coil of rope over\r\nit and started climbing. The top three strands were barbed wire. He\r\ncaught his shirt as he went over, and had to stop for a moment to ease\r\nhimself off. Then he dropped lightly to the grass on the other side.\r\n\r\nThe pack had landed in a clump of white clover. A cloud of disturbed\r\nbees hung above, and he snatched it away quickly lest they should notice\r\nthe honeycomb inside.\r\n\r\nFor a minute he stood still, looking out over the edge. This was\r\ndifferent from looking through the fence, and when he moved it was\r\nslowly. He eased himself to the ground where a corner of rock rose clear\r\nof the thick larkspur and lay on his belly, the stone hard and cool\r\nunder his chin, and looked down.\r\n\r\nThe granite cliff curved away out of sight, and he couldn\'t see if it\r\nhad a foot. He saw only endless blue, beyond, below, and on both sides.\r\nClouds passed slowly.\r\n\r\nDirectly beneath him there was a ledge covered with long grass where\r\nclusters of stars bloomed on tall, slender stalks.\r\n\r\nHe uncoiled his rope and found a stout beech tree not too close to the\r\nedge. Doubling the rope around the bole, he tied one end around his\r\nwaist, slung the pack on his back, and belayed himself down the cliff.\r\nPebbles clattered, saxifrage brushed his arms and tickled his ears; once\r\nhe groped for a hold with his face in a patch of rustling ferns.\r\n\r\nThe climb was hard, but not too much. Less than half an hour later he\r\nwas stretched out on the grass with stars nodding about him. They had a\r\nsharp, gingery smell. He lay in the cool shadow of the world\'s edge for\r\na while, eating apples and honeycomb from his pack. When he was finished\r\nhe licked the honey off his fingers and threw the apple cores over,\r\nwatching them fall into the blue.\r\n\r\nLittle islands floated along, rocking gently in air eddies. Sunlight\r\nflashed on glossy leaves of bushes growing there. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
When an island drifted\r\ninto the shadow of the cliff, the blossoming stars shone out. Beyond the\r\nshadows, deep in the light-filled gulf, he saw the hippogriffs at play.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere were dozens of them, frisking and cavorting in the air. He gazed\r\nat them full of wonder. They pretended to fight, stooped at one another,\r\nsoared off in long spirals to stoop and soar and stoop again. One\r\nflashed by him, a golden palomino that shone like polished wood. The\r\nwind whistled in its wings.\r\n\r\nAway to the left, the cliff fell back in a wide crescent, and nearly\r\nopposite him a river tumbled over the edge. A pool on a ledge beneath\r\ncaught most of the water, and there were hippogriffs drinking. One side\r\nof the broad pool was notched. The overflow fell sheer in a white plume\r\nblown sideways by the wind.\r\n\r\nAs the sun grew hotter, the hippogriffs began to settle and browse on\r\nthe islands that floated past. Not far below, he noticed, a dozen or so\r\nstood drowsily on an island that was floating through the cliff\'s shadow\r\ntoward his ledge. It would pass directly below him.\r\n\r\nWith a sudden resolution, Johnny jerked his rope down from the tree\r\nabove and tied the end to a projecting knob on the cliff. Slinging on\r\nhis pack again, he slid over the edge and down the rope.\r\n\r\nThe island was already passing. The end of the rope trailed through the\r\ngrass. He slithered down and cut a piece off his line.\r\n\r\nIt was barely long enough after he had tied a noose in the end. He\r\nlooked around at the hippogriffs. They had shied away when he dropped\r\nonto the island, but now they stood still, watching him warily.\r\n\r\nJohnny started to take an apple out of his pack, then changed his mind\r\nand took a piece of honeycomb. He broke off one corner and tossed it\r\ntoward them. They fluttered their wings and backed off a few steps, then\r\nstood still again.\r\n\r\nJohnny sat down to wait. They were mostly chestnuts and blacks, and some\r\nhad white stockings. One was piebald. That was the one which, after a\r\nwhile, began edging closer to where the honeycomb had fallen. Johnny sat\r\nvery still.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe piebald sniffed at the honeycomb, then jerked up its head to watch\r\nhim suspiciously. He didn\'t move. After a moment it took the honeycomb.\r\n\r\nWhen he threw another bit, the piebald hippogriff wheeled away, but\r\nreturned almost at once and ate it. Johnny tossed a third piece only a\r\nfew yards from where he was sitting.\r\n\r\nIt was bigger than the others, and the hippogriff had to bite it in two.\r\nWhen the hippogriff bent its head to take the rest Johnny was on his\r\nfeet instantly, swinging his lariat. He dropped the noose over the\r\nhippogriff\'s head. For a moment the animal was too startled to do\r\nanything; then Johnny was on its back, clinging tight.\r\n\r\nThe piebald hippogriff leaped into the air, and Johnny clamped his legs\r\nabout convulsed muscles. Pinions whipped against his knees and wind\r\nblasted his eyes. The world tilted; they were rushing downward. His\r\nknees pressed the sockets of the enormous wings.\r\n\r\nThe distant ramparts of the world swung madly, and he seemed to fall\r\nupward, away from the sun that suddenly glared under the hippogriff\'s\r\ntalons. He forced his knees under the roots of the beating wings and dug\r\nheels into prickling hair. A sob caught his breath and he clenched his\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\nThe universe righted itself about him for a moment and he pulled breath\r\ninto his lungs. Then they plunged again. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Wind searched under his shirt.\r\nOnce he looked down. After that he kept his eyes on the flutter of the\r\nfeather-mane.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA jolt sent him sliding backward. He clutched the rope with slippery\r\nfingers. The wings missed a beat and the hippogriff shook its head as\r\nthe rope momentarily checked its breath. It tried to fly straight up,\r\nlost way, and fell stiff-winged. The long muscles stretched under him as\r\nit arched its back, then bunched when it kicked straight out behind. The\r\nviolence loosened his knees and he trembled with fatigue, but he wound\r\nthe rope around his wrists and pressed his forehead against whitened\r\nknuckles. Another kick, and another. Johnny dragged at the rope.\r\n\r\nThe tense wings flailed, caught air, and brought the hippogriff upright\r\nagain. The rope slackened and he heard huge gasps. Sunlight was hot on\r\nhim again and a drop of sweat crawled down his temple. It tickled. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
He\r\nloosened one hand to dab at the annoyance. A new twist sent him sliding\r\nand he grabbed the rope. The tickle continued until he nearly screamed.\r\nHe no longer dared let go. Another tickle developed beside the first. He\r\nscrubbed his face against the coarse fibre of the rope; the relief was\r\nlike a world conquered.\r\n\r\nThen they glided in a steady spiral that carried them upward with\r\nscarcely a feather\'s motion. When the next plunge came Johnny was ready\r\nfor it and leaned back until the hippogriff arched its neck, trying to\r\nfree itself from the pressure on its windpipe. Half choked, it glided\r\nagain, and Johnny gave it breath.\r\n\r\nThey landed on one of the little islands. The hippogriff drooped its\r\nhead and wings, trembling.\r\n\r\nHe took another piece of honeycomb from his pack and tossed it to the\r\nground where the hippogriff could reach it easily. While it ate he\r\nstroked it and talked to it. When he dismounted the hippogriff took\r\nhoneycomb from his hand. He stroked its neck, breathing the sweet warm\r\nfeathery smell, and laughed aloud when it snuffled the back of his neck.\r\n\r\nTying the rope into a sort of hackamore, he mounted again and rode the\r\nhippogriff to the pool below the thunder and cold spray of the\r\nwaterfall. He took care that it did not drink too much. When he ate some\r\napples for his lunch, the hippogriff ate the cores.\r\n\r\nAfterward he rode to one of the drifting islands and let his mount\r\ngraze. For a while he kept by its side, making much of it. With his\r\nfingers, he combed out the soft flowing plumes of its mane, and examined\r\nits hoofs and the sickle-like talons of the forelegs. He saw how the\r\nsmooth feathers on its forequarters became finer and finer until he\r\ncould scarcely see where the hair on the hindquarters began. Delicate\r\nfeathers covered its head.\r\n\r\nThe island glided further and further away from the cliffs, and he\r\nwatched the waterfall dwindle away to a streak and disappear. After a\r\nwhile he fell asleep.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe woke with a start, suddenly cold: the setting sun was below his\r\nisland. The feathery odor was still on his hands. He looked around for\r\nthe hippogriff and saw it sniffing at his pack.\r\n\r\nWhen it saw him move, it trotted up to him with an expectant air. He\r\nthrew his arms about the great flat-muscled neck and pressed his face\r\nagainst the warm feathers, with a faint sense of embarrassment at\r\nfeeling tears in his eyes.\r\n\r\n"Good old Patch," he said, and got his pack. He shared the last piece of\r\nhoneycomb with his hippogriff and watched the sun sink still further.\r\nThe clouds were turning red.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s go see those clouds," Johnny said. He mounted the piebald\r\nhippogriff and they flew off, up through the golden air to the sunset\r\nclouds. There they stopped and Johnny dismounted on the highest cloud of\r\nall, stood there as it turned slowly gray, and looked into dimming\r\ndepths. When he turned to look at the world, he saw only a wide smudge\r\nof darkness spread in the distance.\r\n\r\nThe cloud they were standing on turned silver. Johnny glanced up and saw\r\nthe moon, a crescent shore far above.\r\n\r\nHe ate an apple and gave one to his hippogriff. While he chewed he gazed\r\nback at the world. When he finished his apple, he was about to toss the\r\ncore to the hippogriff, but stopped himself and carefully took out the\r\nseeds first. With the seeds in his pocket, he mounted again.\r\n\r\nHe took a deep breath. "Come on, Patch," he said.
