The eight-mile chunk of rock was the last link\r\nin a chain of nine asteroid navigational-markers still needing blinker\r\nequipment installation. Minutes later, the _Minnow_ lay neatly berthed\r\nin the deepest hollow of the asteroid, the shining wires of its drill\r\ngrapples anchoring it firmly to the jagged rock. The airlock opened\r\nand two men in spacesuits stepped out. They climbed to the top of the\r\nnearest hill dragging a platform of tools and equipment; the ragged,\r\nclose horizons of the asteroid made a hostile background for them as\r\nthey worked in silence.\r\n\r\nBallard leaned far over the rough edge of a circular pit, directing\r\nthe heat radiation beam that melted the foundation plastic smoothly\r\nover the walls. He couldn\'t spare the time to turn his head and watch\r\nWalton, but he could follow the other\'s progress in welding the\r\nframework of the blinker tower by the irregular breathing and clanks\r\nand buzzes coming through his earphones. He listened to Walton\'s\r\nmotions with an automatic alertness developed over six long weeks of\r\ntension--ever since the finding of the rotenite nuggets on the second\r\nof the light-marker asteroids. The rotenite represented enough wealth\r\nto make them among the richest men in the solar system. Or one of\r\nthem--_the_ richest. That was what Ballard was afraid of.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the clanks and rustles stopped, and Walton\'s voice muttered:\r\n"Must have left the number three flux; better go back for it."\r\n\r\n"What?" Ballard caught himself asking rhetorically, apprehension\r\nflooding through him.\r\n\r\n"I said I left something. Have to go back and get it." There was a\r\nfaint tremor in Walton\'s voice.\r\n\r\nWith a hard calm he wouldn\'t have recognized six weeks ago, Ballard\r\nconsidered the consequences of making an excuse to go with Walton.\r\nBut the excuse would destroy the pose of innocence he\'d so carefully\r\nacted since his first suspicions of Walton\'s intention. And he could be\r\nwrong. No sense in antagonizing Walton, particularly with the frayed\r\ncondition both their nerves were in. "Ok," he grunted. "Bring back\r\nanother 5R bit; this one I\'ve been using chitters."\r\n\r\nThere were the sounds of Walton bounding down towards the ship in the\r\npeculiar dancing glide demanded by the low gravity. Methodically,\r\nwithout looking up, Ballard continued his job, following Walton with\r\nhis earphones. Only when the foundation fill was laid would it seem\r\nnatural for him to stop working for a moment and go to the ship.\r\n\r\nGradually, layer on layer, the plastic melted, coated the walls and\r\nhardened. He heard Walton reach the ship, then there was a slight\r\nringing noise as the man touched his key-magnet to the airlock. As\r\nWalton entered the lock, his mike registered the pressure of air by\r\nsuddenly picking up all the sounds of the ship; the throbbing of the\r\ngenerators, the intermittent rush and sigh of the air conditioner, and\r\nthe close curved walls echoing back the scrape of his shoes on the\r\nlocker room floor.\r\n\r\nFour minutes to go. Ballard finished melting the plastic onto the\r\nwalls, resisting the urge to hurry and risk botching the work. Walton\r\nhad no reason to kill him--except for the rotenite. And since its\r\ndiscovery, Walton had shown nothing but a surface friendship covering a\r\nhidden hatred and fear that was growing into surreptitious maneuverings\r\ntowards murder. But with a pretense at normality, Ballard hoped Walton\r\nwould get over his obsession and forget it, never knowing that he\'d\r\nseen anything suspicious. And meanwhile Ballard had only to stay out of\r\nthe way of accidents without seeming suspiciously careful.\r\n\r\nHe added the last necessary layer of plastic, switched off the heat\r\nbeam and stood up. There was no sign of motion around the _Minnow_.\r\nWalton had not come out, but Ballard\'s earphones continued to pick up\r\nWalton\'s nervous, irregular breathing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBallard started down the hill in long, low floating bounds. The\r\n_Minnow_ expanded up at him, a ship etched in black and white against\r\na jagged mass of black and grey ores. Just before landing on his\r\nsecond bound, his earphones picked up a sharp metallic ringing note he\r\ncouldn\'t identify. Suddenly the ship expanded up directly in front of\r\nhim; he\'d overshot his landing. He thudded into the ship, slid down to\r\nthe ground and landed facing the lock, his key-magnet in hand.\r\n\r\nAgain he heard the familiar tuning-fork note, this time ringing faintly\r\nup from the magnet in his own hand as he put it against the circle of\r\nlighter metal that was the lock. The circle turned, with the magnet\r\nrotating out into a handle. He grabbed it and yanked to slide back the\r\nairlock panel. The yank pulled him off his feet. For an instant he\r\ncouldn\'t orientate; then he realized that _he_ had moved because the\r\npanel had not. It was a case of action or reaction. The panel had not\r\nbudged, seeming to be one with the flawless sweep of the hull.\r\n\r\nHe tried again, yanking it with the same futile results. Apprehension\r\nflooded through him. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
"Walton!" 

=== Chunk 4 ===
he called. "Walton, the panel\'s stuck!\r\nOpen it from the inside!"\r\n\r\nFor an instant he was aware of Walton\'s nervous breathing, then it\r\nstopped--there was a low chuckle. "Listen, Ballard! I\'d be crazy to\r\nlet you in. Don\'t you think I\'ve seen you watching me like a hawk ever\r\nsince we found the rotenite, just waiting for a chance to catch me off\r\nguard! I should have done this weeks ago, but it didn\'t occur to me how\r\nclean and easy it would be until I thought of the airlock jamming with\r\nyou outside. So--the lock is jammed and you have left little over two\r\nhours of suit oxygen. And while you\'re out there suffocating to death,\r\nI\'ll be waiting in my sleep-tank on a nice euphoriac jag. It\'s going to\r\nbe nice being the richest man in the--"\r\n\r\n"Wait! Walton, listen! 

=== Chunk 5 ===
You\'re all wrong! I--"\r\n\r\nWalton had cut his radio. For a moment, Ballard dumbly stood there,\r\nhis mind racing around like a pin-wheel. Slowly it stopped, as numbing\r\nfear coursed through his nervous system. He\'d under-concealed his\r\nsuspicions, after all; Walton had suspected him of the very same thing\r\nhe\'d suspected Walton of.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, in spite of his predicament, in spite of death waiting for\r\nhim only a few hours in the future, Ballard smiled. He really couldn\'t\r\nhate Walton for what he\'d done; it was the old cliche again of too much\r\ngreed and suspicion.\r\n\r\nHe realized that this didn\'t alter the fact that he was going to\r\ndie--unless he could think of something fast. Ballard looked at his\r\nchronometer; he now had less than two hours.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this, his mind suddenly calmed and became clear. First he\'d\r\nhave to think of all the possibilities of getting into the _Minnow_,\r\nthen allot only so much time to each possibility. There was the welding\r\ntorch, the heat-beam, a pneumatic jackhammer, and miscellaneous hand\r\ntools. Surely with that assortment he could knock or burn a hole in the\r\nship. All the air would swish out, but there were enough suit cylinders\r\nto allow him to take the ship back if he didn\'t damage it too badly\r\ngetting in. And Walton would be safe in his sleep-tank; Ballard would\r\nsee to that by disconnecting the awakener.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBallard smiled at the stars as he bounded back to the hill where the\r\ntools lay. Walton had been a fool to lock him out here with cutting,\r\nburning, and pounding equipment--and almost two hours in which to use\r\nthem. Things weren\'t so bad after all.\r\n\r\nHe decided to try the welding torch first. He crossed over to the\r\nalmost-completed blinker tower and picked up the torch and power-pack,\r\nthen from a tool box he selected a cutting nozzle.\r\n\r\nCarefully, so not to exert himself and waste oxygen, he glided down\r\nwith his gear to the aft section of the _Minnow\'s_ hull just forward\r\nof the tubes where the skin was thinnest. As he ignited the torch, he\r\nwas aware of what a temptation it was to drain off all the oxygen\r\ncontained in the power-pack into his own cylinder. Quickly he went\r\nahead and applied the torch to the skin of the ship. Ballard glanced at\r\nhis chronometer: An hour and a half to go. Good. Fifteen minutes would\r\nbe long enough to tell whether the torch would cut through the skin or\r\nnot. If it would, then he could use the rest of the time in cutting the\r\nhole.\r\n\r\nAfter the first five minutes he turned the nozzle away and examined the\r\nspot where it had been applied. Not a mark.\r\n\r\nSix minutes went by. Then seven, eight, nine--\r\n\r\nAgain he looked at the skin; still no change.\r\n\r\nThree more minutes went by. Ballard felt sweat break out on his face\r\nas he pulled the torch away for a third time. For a moment--his eyes\r\nstill blinded by the glare--he could see nothing. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
His heart sank. Then\r\nhe detected a faint red spot with a whitish center. _It was working._\r\nThree more minutes and the hole would be started. He turned back the\r\nnozzle to the glowing spot. Then with dismay he watched the torch\r\nsputter and go dead. Frantically he pushed the activator button--\r\n\r\nStunned, he finally noticed that the power-pack read empty. Walton had\r\nnearly exhausted it on the blinker tower.\r\n\r\nBallard glanced at his wrist. He still had an hour and fourteen minutes.\r\n\r\nHe didn\'t smile at the stars this time as he went back up the hill.\r\nThings didn\'t seem ironic any more, merely dangerous. He loaded the\r\nheat-beam with its larger power-pack onto the equipment platform and\r\nslowly dragged it behind him down to the ship.\r\n\r\nAn hour and two minutes left. He went to work adjusting the beam to its\r\nmaximum intensity; then, moving it as close to the hull as possible, he\r\nturned it on full force.\r\n\r\nTime seemed to have stopped. Twice in one minute Ballard glanced at his\r\nwrist, expecting to see a lapse of ten or fifteen minutes. Only five\r\nminutes had dragged by; he now had just fifty-seven left. His spacesuit\r\nsuddenly began reminding him of a coffin. With superhuman effort he\r\njerked his thoughts away from suffocation and back to the job.\r\n\r\nForty-five minutes to go. _The beam wasn\'t going to work._ The sudden\r\nrealization cut into Ballard like a knife. He should have known that in\r\nthe first place; a beam meant for plastic wasn\'t intense enough for the\r\nskin of a spaceship.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis time as Ballard once more climbed the hill, the stars seemed to be\r\nsmiling at him. But not with friendliness. They seemed to smile _death_.\r\n\r\nHe got the jackhammer all the way down to the ship before a devastating\r\nthought struck him. He\'d forgotten that the hammer had a cracked 5R\r\nbit; it would fly to pieces on the diamond hardness of the hull.\r\n\r\nHe sat down, stunned at the fact that he\'d run out of things to try.\r\nThe ship lay before him like some impenetrable fortress. Several\r\nprecious minutes dragged by before Ballard could again calm his\r\nspinning brain. He still had forty minutes. Had he overlooked any other\r\npossibility of getting into the ship?\r\n\r\nSlowly he walked around the _Minnow_, concentrating as he\'d never\r\nconcentrated before. Then as he stepped in front of the drive tubes\r\nsomething clicked: _The main tube was large enough for him to crawl\r\ninto. If he could remove the recoil plate and hydraulic mechanism,\r\nhe might be able to burn a hole through the ordinary steel bulkhead\r\nbeyond._\r\n\r\nHalf-bounding and half-running, he returned from the hill with the\r\ntool box. After selecting several likely wrench sizes, he grabbed a\r\nflashlight and crawled up the tube. He wasted five minutes unscrewing\r\nthe first bolt holding the plate in place. The second bolt was so\r\ncorroded he couldn\'t budge it. Cursing he crawled out and dragged in\r\nthe jackhammer, hoping the cracked 5R bit would hold until the bolt\r\nwas knocked out.\r\n\r\nIt almost held, flying to pieces just as there was a quarter inch to\r\ngo. Frantically he somehow managed to knock the remainder out with the\r\nchuck of the hammer. But it had taken Ballard five more minutes. _Only\r\ntwenty-five left._\r\n\r\nHe went out and grabbed a crowbar and pried the plate off, recoil\r\ncylinder and hydraulic fluid following like a jack-in-the-box.\r\nAfter cleaning out the drive tube he almost lost his reason when he\r\ndiscovered the cable connecting the beam to the power-pack wasn\'t long\r\nenough to reach the bulkhead. Fortunately he found an extension in the\r\nbottom of the tool box.\r\n\r\n_Fifteen minutes to go._\r\n\r\nThat should be just long enough. He switched on the beam. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Now time\r\nseemed to race by. At ten minutes to go the bulkhead turned a\r\ncherry-red. At five minutes it was almost white. At four, the steel\r\nstarted to buckle. At three--the heat-beam suddenly went dead. The\r\npower-pack was empty.\r\n\r\nBallard\'s reason reeled. He grabbed the crowbar and jabbed at the fast\r\ncooling metal.\r\n\r\n_Too late._\r\n\r\nIn the one minute he had left to live, Ballard suddenly became calm,\r\nreconciling himself to his end. Wearily he crawled out of the tube.\r\nAt least Walton would be in for a nasty surprise, with the main drive\r\nrecoil plate gone. And to make sure, he would push it off into space.\r\nWith one last surge of fury he dragged up the foot thick plate he\r\ncould never have lifted back on Earth, and started shoving to give it\r\nmomentum.\r\n\r\n_Momentum equals velocity times mass._ Suddenly he stopped, the plate\r\ndrifting on ahead of him. Now why had he thought of that? Something\r\nfrom his school days--he tried hard to remember--something about\r\nmass....\r\n\r\n_Mass is a constant. Weight is a variable, but mass is what knocks\r\nholes in things--spaceships, for instance._\r\n\r\nJust one thing could save him now--momentum. Ballard glanced at his\r\nwrist. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
Twenty seconds to go. Then maybe another twenty from the oxygen\r\nin the connecting tube. Not much time--\r\n\r\nHe bounded off after the still-drifting plate, then began forcing\r\nit around in a semi-circle back toward the ship. The recoil plate\r\nsluggishly began to move faster as it gained momentum. It started\r\ngetting ahead of him so he gave it one last push, and it slowly crept\r\naway heading straight for the hull. It floated edge-wise into the aft\r\nsection--and kept on going. A three foot stream of light poured out\r\nfrom the side of the ship.\r\n\r\nBallard started crawling into the hull and the light wavered and\r\nbrightened. He couldn\'t understand it. Then it dimmed altogether--\r\n\r\n_The last of his oxygen was gone._\r\n\r\nDizzily he tried to squeeze through the rip. He kept slipping back ...\r\nback. There was a roaring darkness all around him, but he could still\r\ncrawl.\r\n\r\nFor ages he seemed to be crawling over polished glass--His head crashed\r\ninto something that clanged hollowly. Some fading portion of his\r\nconsciousness told him he was inside the ship--and the clang had been\r\nthe spacelocker. Automatically, as though by instinct, he reached up\r\nand fumbled with the handle--Then he was clumsily trying to fit a new\r\noxygen cylinder into place....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBallard awoke feeling cramped and tired, as though he\'d slept all\r\nnight in a bird cage. He looked at his chronometer, then at his\r\nsuit air-gauge. No. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
He\'d been out only a few minutes. He got up and\r\ncrawled into the sleep-tank compartment and disconnected Walton\'s\r\nawakener. Then he went into the control room and looked up the nearest\r\nspace-freighter lane in the radio call book, and set up an automatic\r\ndistress signal. He felt as if he were going to pass out again--this\r\ntime from sheer fatigue. There was still one thing more he wanted to do.\r\n\r\nOut of the nose compartment he hauled a small case containing what had\r\ncaused all the trouble--\r\n\r\nThen he crawled back out through the torn hull skin, opened the case\r\nand flung every single one of the rotenite nuggets far out into space.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
