Ramm\r\n\r\n               Jeremy knew he was in danger of flunking\r\n              his final course and that meant a washout.\r\n                 But he sat down before the panel and\r\n               concentrated. The problem was one of mind\r\n               over matter--three parsecs of space away!\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Imagination Stories of Science and Fantasy\r\n                             November 1953\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen he came to the head of the examination corridor, Jeremy glanced\r\nbriefly at the slip of paper in his hand. Room 16B. He strode\r\nunhesitatingly down the long hall; his long legs carrying him along\r\nswiftly. After six years at the University, he knew the exact location\r\nof the tiny testing cubicle which had been assigned to him for his\r\nfinal exam in Advanced Deliberation And Memory.\r\n\r\nHe hesitated a moment before the door of 16B, shook his head as if in\r\ndefiance, then entered the room. He was in for a tough time and he\r\nknew it. The classes he had cut were sure to affect his chances of\r\npassing the test and he needed the course credits for graduation.\r\n\r\nTaking the course record card from his pocket, he slipped it into the\r\nmachine that would automatically record his mark at the close of the\r\ntest.\r\n\r\nThen he settled his long frame into the seat placed conveniently in\r\nfront of the panels of dials and the computing machines which filled\r\none entire side of the room. Checking to make sure that everything\r\nhe might need was in place, he reached out and snapped the switch\r\nmarked--INSTRUCTIONS.\r\n\r\n"You are ready, Student Hovah?" The voice came gently from a hidden\r\nloudspeaker.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Instructor."\r\n\r\n"Then listen to your orders. You have been alloted sector 2645 of space\r\nin parsec three.\r\n\r\n"In the next ten minutes we shall transmit a detailed study of a star\r\nsystem to you. Using only the raw materials of space and the mental\r\ntechniques taught you in your studies, you will reproduce a reasonable\r\nfacsimile of the system in the space sector you have been assigned.\r\nHave you any questions?"\r\n\r\n"How complete a facsimile must it be, Instructor?"\r\n\r\n"It must be reasonably correct as to physical makeup. All life forms\r\nmust also be reproduced.

"\r\n\r\n"I am ready."\r\n\r\nFor the next ten minutes he sat tensed in his chair as the impulses\r\nfrom the psychoscope washed through his mind and body. He gradually\r\nabsorbed a three dimensional mental picture of the system he was to\r\nreproduce. When the image faded, he relaxed a moment, then laid his\r\nfingers on the keyboard and went to work.\r\n\r\nGradually his confidence grew. Under the direction of his flashing\r\nfingers, the energy machines created a warp in the space of his\r\nsector. At exactly the correct moment he adjusted the wavelength of\r\nhis Thought Augmentor until it matched the thought matrix of his own\r\nmind. The full impact of his tremendous mental abilities jolted into\r\nthe space warp. And as the sweat of concentration gathered on his\r\nforehead, he hopefully watched the viewing screen on one of the panels\r\nbefore him. At first there was only a mere flicker in the center of\r\nthe warp. Then swiftly, so swiftly that he barely had time to lower\r\nhis eyes protectively, the entire screen flared into the light of raw\r\nuncontained energy.\r\n\r\nOnce more Jeremy\'s fingers worked feverishly and constricting force\r\nbeams slowly brought the chaos under control. At last there gleamed on\r\nhis screen the steady glare of a hot new sun.\r\n\r\nNow that he had the sun material to draw upon, he easily reconstructed\r\nthe entire system he had been assigned. By setting up stresses and\r\nstrains within the star he caused huge chunks to spin off and take up\r\norbits about it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe problem so engrossed him that he scarcely noticed the passage of\r\ntime. Periodically he would get hungry or thirsty. It was a simple\r\nmatter to press the proper buttons and hurriedly gulp the foods\r\nthat appeared. Whenever he tired mentally, he tilted his chair to a\r\ncomfortable position and slept.\r\n\r\nAnd as the days passed, the facsimile took shape under his genius. Each\r\nseparate world became a duplicate of its original. Mountains were born;\r\nthe seas dashed at first against shores that were bare and bleak; then\r\nthe magic of plant life on all the varied worlds assumed a rainbow of\r\ncolors. The ooze of the oceans began to crawl. On land and in the air\r\nanimals appeared.\r\n\r\nAt last, through fatigue-rimmed eyes, he looked at what he had created\r\nand it was good. With a smile on his lips he relaxed. Although he\r\nreached out to cut off the power to his Thought Augmentor, he didn\'t\r\nquite reach the switch before he fell into a restless sleep. He tossed\r\nand turned, twitched and dreamed.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke, he noticed that the power was still on. He quickly\r\nturned it off.

A hurried, searching glance at the screen assured\r\nhim. The facsimile was still good. Then he pressed the switch\r\nmarked--INSTRUCTIONS.\r\n\r\n"You are finished, Student Hovah?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Instructor!"\r\n\r\n"It took you a long time--six whole days."\r\n\r\n"Indeed? But it was a complicated problem."\r\n\r\n"That is true. Wait while we examine your work."\r\n\r\nThe next few moments seemed as long as the whole exam time had.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a gasp burst from the loudspeaker. "What is this? There is no\r\ncreature such as this on any of the original worlds assigned to you.\r\nExplain please."\r\n\r\nJeremy tuned in on the thought and sight wave of the Instructor. Before\r\nhim was a creature that he could not remember creating.\r\n\r\n"You remember this creature, Student Hovah?"\r\n\r\n"No, Instructor."\r\n\r\n"But it must be yours. The entire facsimile is tuned to your\r\nwavelength. We have checked. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Only you could have brought it into being;\r\nonly you can destroy it. You know it is against the rules to increase\r\nthe number of species in Creation. Destroy it!"\r\n\r\nJeremy looked at the creature so comfortably asleep against a tree and\r\nhe felt pity and compassion and love for it.\r\n\r\n"I cannot, Instructor. I do not know how it got there, unless it is\r\na product of my dreams. Once I forgot to shut off the power while I\r\nslept."\r\n\r\n"Sheer negligence! Destroy it, I say!"\r\n\r\n"No it belongs there now. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
And it looks lonely." Without warning he\r\nsnapped on his Augmentor and before the Instructor could interfere,\r\nthere appeared on the grass beside the creature another of the same\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n"Now you\'ve done it," the Instructor screamed. "It can reproduce its\r\nkind." His voice grew coldly stern. "You have created an unreasonable\r\nfacsimile. You know what that means."\r\n\r\nMutely Jeremy got up from his chair. Automatically he reached for his\r\ncourse record card in Advanced Deliberation And Memory. To save space\r\non it all courses were listed by the first letters of the course name.\r\nA glance verified the Instructor\'s verdict:\r\n\r\nJ. Hovah\r\n\r\nFailed in ADAM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
