This planet was\r\nso far beyond the Terran sphere of exploration that he feared the\r\nnew-comers might not be human.\r\n\r\nHe was surprised to sight the spaceship settling about half a mile\r\naway, in the vicinity of the wreck. The lines seemed to be Terran.\r\n\r\n"They picked that spot on purpose," he muttered. "Couldn\'t be somebody\r\nafter me, could it?"\r\n\r\nThere was no lack of good reason for the law to be after him. In the\r\nfirst place, the battered hull out there had not belonged to him. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
In\r\nthe second, the authorities might be trying to find out what had become\r\nof the original crew. Quasmin could not answer that even if he wanted\r\nto--a corpse was difficult to locate in interstellar space.\r\n\r\nHe took advantage of the cooling period after the ship had touched down\r\nto make his way through the scrubby growth that resembled a forest\r\nexcept for the purplish color of the drooping fronds. He found a good\r\nspy point on a low hill and settled down to watch.\r\n\r\nIn due time, the airlock within Quasmin\'s view opened. A single\r\nspace-suited figure climbed clumsily down the ladder, paused to glance\r\nabout, and walked a circuit of the ship as if to survey the terrain.\r\n\r\nApparently deciding that nothing dangerous flew or crept in the\r\nvicinity, the spacer returned to the base of the ladder to remove his\r\nsuit. He dropped it there, hitched at his belt--suggesting to Quasmin\r\nthe weight of a weapon--and began to stroll across the turf of springy\r\ncreepers toward the wreck. Quasmin followed as sneakily as he could.\r\n\r\nPassing the strange ship, some instinct told him that it was now\r\nunoccupied. The whole attitude of the spacer had suggested a man as\r\nmuch alone as Quasmin himself. The latter temporarily abandoned his\r\nskulking pace to walk boldly where he might be seen by any crew members\r\non watch. No activity resulted.\r\n\r\nKeeping one eye on the distant figure, Quasmin moved toward the\r\nspacesuit at the foot of the ladder. Just as he was about to reach out\r\nfor it, the air took on the resiliency of sponge-covered springs and\r\nthrust his outstretched hand right back at him.\r\n\r\n"Force shield!" he growled. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
"Damn! Probably set to his voice or some\r\nsuch code. Well, I can\'t get closer, but it proves he must be alone."\r\n\r\nHe squinted at the nametape on the breast of the spacesuit and read,\r\n"J. Trolla."\r\n\r\nThen he hurried after the spacer, who was just disappearing behind a\r\nclump of shrubbery.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe could not decide later just when Trolla had in some fashion become\r\naware of him. Quasmin could remember no careless move that might have\r\ngiven him away, nor did he think it likely that he was confronted by\r\na practiced telepath. Such people existed, but they were not normally\r\npermitted to risk their unique talents flitting about the unexplored\r\ndepths of interstellar space. Quasmin blamed it on natural animal\r\ninstinct.\r\n\r\nIf he could have seen Trolla during the latter\'s inspection of the\r\nwrecked ship\'s interior, he would have worried even more. It was no\r\nidle poking about for possible salvage. The spacer spent over an hour\r\nexamining those compartments accessible without the use of a torch to\r\nburn away crumpled metal and plastic bulkheads. He displayed unusual\r\ninterest in things of obscure value, such as articles of clothing and\r\nempty plastic crates that had once held food supplies.\r\n\r\nHe also talked a good deal to himself in a low voice, but the battered\r\nhull concealed this from the man lurking outside.\r\n\r\nThat there was a watcher there, Trolla stopped doubting when he\r\nmentally summed up the amount of minor equipment obviously removed from\r\nthe ship since the crash. He decided it was not necessary to penetrate\r\nthe broken-up drive sections in what had been the lower levels before\r\nthe hull had toppled over. The scavenging looked like the work of one\r\nindividual unable to salvage any of the heavier machinery.\r\n\r\n"Just took some things to make himself more comfortable," he murmured.\r\n"A few instruments, food, medicines, self-powered appliances, and the\r\nlike."\r\n\r\nHe considered returning to his own ship for equipment with which\r\nto make a real check that would include search for and analysis of\r\nfingerprints, hair, perspiration traces ... and perhaps even blood\r\nsamples.\r\n\r\n"Why waste time?" he asked himself. "It has to be Quasmin, and there\'s\r\nnot much chance of finding anyone with him. Why not just see where he\'s\r\nholed up--before he starts running again and makes it a long job?"\r\n\r\nEmerging through a rent in the hull, he was again struck by the\r\nsensation of being watched. He could not control a slight motion of\r\none hand to his belt for the reassuring touch of his gas gun. With\r\nit, he could fill the air around any attacker with a scattering of\r\ntiny, anesthetic pellets while the personal force shield he wore would\r\nprotect him from any hostile return. Though assuming that Quasmin\r\nwould be armed, he did not think the man could have obtained a shield.\r\nNone had been reported missing by any law-enforcement agency within\r\nimaginable range of this untouched planet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTrolla walked about the wreck twice before he spotted the dim trail\r\nthat revealed infrequent visits to the place. Cautiously, he followed\r\nit along the edge of the taller, purplish growth that almost boasted\r\nthe dimensions of trees, wondering if he would presently detect sounds\r\nof someone trailing _him_.\r\n\r\nBy the time he sighted the crude shack from a low hilltop, he believed\r\nhe had heard sounds three or four times. They _might_ have been\r\nindications of native life forms. He forgot about them as he examined\r\nthe refuge that Quasmin had built.\r\n\r\nThe hut was crookedly assembled of bulkhead sections ripped from the\r\nwreck. There had evidently been batteries available to power simple\r\ntools, for lengths of bent plastic were bolted around the corners, and\r\ntwo windows had been cut in the walls. A mound of dirt had been heaped\r\nup against one of the sides.\r\n\r\n"Digging in for the winter season," muttered Trolla, nodding. "Yes,\r\nhe\'ll need some insulation."\r\n\r\nHe delayed looking inside, lest he provoke some reaction before\r\nlearning all that he wished. Instead, he walked on past the shack, and\r\nthus came upon a small stream and an almost pitiful attempt at building\r\na waterwheel.\r\n\r\n"Must work, though," he told himself. "He must have been using it to\r\nrecharge batteries for the distress calls he has the nerve to keep\r\nbroadcasting. Wonder if he knows they don\'t have much effect over fifty\r\nbillion miles?"\r\n\r\nHe crossed the brook and looked over the two small fields beyond.\r\nThey had been cleared and roughly ploughed by some laborious means he\r\npreferred not to contemplate. It was standard procedure for spaceships\r\nto carry planting supplies for just such situations, and he had to\r\napprove the beginnings made by Quasmin. Retracing his steps to the\r\nshack, he found the opportunity to say so.\r\n\r\n"Oh, there you are!" said Quasmin. "I was looking out near your ship to\r\nsee who landed. Is there just you?"\r\n\r\nTrolla savored the glint of animal cunning not quite disguised in the\r\nother\'s glance. He decided to quash the verbal sparring at the outset.\r\n\r\n"How many did you expect, Quasmin?" he inquired pleasantly. "My\r\ndepartment has to police three planetary systems, spread widely along\r\nthis frontier. We can\'t afford fuel and rations to send a brass band\r\nafter you!"\r\n\r\nThe shock was good for three or four minutes of bristling silence.\r\n\r\nTwice, Quasmin opened his mouth as if to deny his identity, but thought\r\nbetter of it. His scowl faded into an expression of studied insolence.\r\n\r\n"So you\'re a cop," he sneered. "What d\'ya think ya gonna do, way out\r\nhere where ya can hardly even call in to headquarters?"\r\n\r\n"That depends," said Trolla, eyeing him analytically. "To be perfectly\r\nfrank, I can\'t call headquarters. Don\'t you know how far out we are\r\nfrom the outmost little observation post of humanity? Or did you just\r\ngive up all astrogation whenever you got rid of those crewmen you\r\nkidnapped?"\r\n\r\n"How can you prove I got rid of them?" demanded Quasmin with the same\r\nsneer.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t even want to bother. There are eleven murder charges hanging\r\nover you besides drug-smuggling and that rape on Vammu IV; and even I\r\ncan hardly understand that last. Those people are only semi-humanoid!

=== Chunk 4 ===
"\r\n\r\nQuasmin grinned. Trolla felt vaguely sickened at the sudden realization\r\nthat his momentary betrayal of a sense of decency was taken as a sign\r\nof timidity.\r\n\r\nThe other turned aside and took a few slow steps to where an empty\r\nplastic crate had been braced against a rock for a seat. He sat down\r\nand leaned his shoulders against the rock, but with an attitude of\r\nalertness. It was the first physical move made by either since Trolla\r\nhad walked around the corner of the hut.\r\n\r\n"Maybe ya think you\'ll arrest me," he said, watching Trolla carefully.\r\n"Maybe ya think I don\'t pack the same handful of sleep you do!"\r\n\r\n"And a shield too?

=== Chunk 5 ===
"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nQuasmin\'s eyes narrowed at that. He seemed to estimate his chances of\r\ncalling a bluff, then relaxed slightly, accepting the truth.\r\n\r\n"Suppose we shoot it out, then," he suggested. "You might kill me at\r\nthis range, with an overdose before the pellets scatter. Ya get too\r\nmuch gas in me, an\' you\'ll be up for murder too."\r\n\r\n"That would be your mistake," said Trolla.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you might get off," said Quasmin judiciously. "But there lots of\r\npeople will still say it\'s murder. You bein\' a cop makes no difference.\r\nCivilization bein\' what it is, the law\'s gotta protect _me_ too! I\r\ngotta right to be helped more than average, because I\'m in more than\r\naverage trouble--right?"\r\n\r\nTrolla nodded, but less in agreement than confirming some suspicion of\r\nhis own.\r\n\r\n"And you\'d refuse to come with me even if I ordered you?"\r\n\r\n"What a dummy ya\'d be to try an\' make me!" grunted Quasmin. "You gotta\r\nsleep sometime--an\' you\'d sure as hell wake up the wrong side of the\r\nairlock!"\r\n\r\nHe grinned at the other with his ugly expression of petty triumph and\r\nadded, "Ya got nerve to try it after a fair warning?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps not," admitted Trolla.\r\n\r\n"Huh! Ya got some sense after all. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Why don\'t ya just go away an\' let me\r\nalone? Nobody ever gave your bunch jurisdiction out here. I bet this\r\nplanet was never even reported, was it?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s not on record," Trolla confirmed. "As far as I know, the only\r\nhumans to reach it are you and I--and I almost turned back. How you\r\npicked it up, I don\'t know, but I was playing a hunch when I picked up\r\nyour distress call."\r\n\r\nQuasmin leaned back in more relaxed fashion.\r\n\r\n"Well, ya got a problem," he grinned. "I ain\'t leavin\' here with ya,\r\nan\' what chance have ya got of bringin\' a judge an\' jury out here? I\r\ngotta right to a fair trial with legal an\' psychiatric advice!"\r\n\r\nTrolla took two steps to lean his shoulder against a corner of the hut.\r\nThe ill-constructed joint sagged under his weight.\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t it occur to you that you\'re having your trial right now?" he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n_That reached him_, he thought, with a certain ironic satisfaction.\r\n\r\nQuasmin glared at him in outraged disbelief. He spat on the ground and\r\ndemanded, "What\'re ya doin\'? Settin\' yourself up as judge an\' jury all\r\nby yourself?"\r\n\r\n"And executioner, if need be," agreed Trolla.\r\n\r\nHe watched in silence as the other\'s jaw hung slackly, then as Quasmin\r\nslowly turned red with temper.\r\n\r\n"You ... you ... why, ya dirty _cop_, ya! That\'s against every law\r\nthat ever was. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
They ... they wouldn\'t _let_ ya!"\r\n\r\n"There\'s no other way. As you said, they can\'t send out people to hold\r\na trial here. It isn\'t safe to take you back alone. They couldn\'t spare\r\nmore officers to come with me on the off chance you\'d be found way out\r\nhere."\r\n\r\n"No matter how far it is, you ain\'t got any right to do that!"\r\n\r\nQuasmin\'s right hand was beneath his shirt but Trolla, secure within\r\nhis shield, ignored that.\r\n\r\n"Well, then," he said, "if mere distance doesn\'t put this planet beyond\r\nhuman law, the same goes for _you_."\r\n\r\n"I still have a fair trial comin\' then!"\r\n\r\n"You\'re having it right now," Trolla told him.\r\n\r\n"Like hell!" Quasmin snarled. He was on his feet now, teetering on his\r\ntoes. "I know my rights. I oughta be gettin\' rescue an\' rehabilitation\r\nhelp. _You_ can\'t do anything but kill me. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
You got no right!"\r\n\r\nTrolla pushed off from the corner of the shack with a hunch of his\r\nshoulder. He took a few steps toward the trail out of the clearing,\r\nthen hesitated.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve had a lot of rehabilitation work, haven\'t you?" he pointed\r\nout. "I had plenty of time to study your records, on the way out from\r\nBlauchen III."\r\n\r\n"Ya can\'t talk me into comin\' in for more psych treatments!" growled\r\nQuasmin. "I had enough of those guys, since I was a kid."\r\n\r\n"Yes, you were a little too smart for them," agreed Trolla. "The most\r\nthey ever managed was a good, thorough conditioning against suicide,\r\nafter you put on a psycho act to break up the second trial for murder."\r\n\r\nQuasmin grinned again.\r\n\r\n"I sure suckered them that time," he recalled with gloating. "The\r\ntreatment didn\'t hurt any \'cause I never did have any idea of killin\'\r\nmyself; an\' it got me outa the other mess till I could make a break."\r\n\r\n"It won\'t get you out of this one."\r\n\r\nQuasmin\'s grin left him.\r\n\r\n"Made up your mind already?" he demanded, half drawing a gas pistol of\r\nhis own.\r\n\r\n"Not yet," said Trolla. "I\'ll go back to my ship to think it over."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe walked away, though keeping a prudent watch over his shoulder until\r\nhe was a hundred meters distant. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
Even after that, he turned around\r\noccasionally. This made it difficult for Quasmin to follow him, but the\r\noutlaw managed to be in position to observe Trolla\'s arrival at his\r\nship.\r\n\r\nHe spied as the detective recovered his spacesuit and climbed the\r\nladder to the airlock. When there appeared to be no likelihood of his\r\nemerging for some time, Quasmin scuttled back to his hut.\r\n\r\n"No sense bein\' here if he comes lookin\' for me with his gun an\'\r\nshield," he growled to himself. "Maybe I bluffed him, an\' maybe I\r\ndidn\'t."\r\n\r\nHe threw together a small bundle of rations and rolled it with a water\r\nbottle in a blanket. As he did so, he muttered a stream of curses.\r\n\r\n"He\'s got no right to try anythin\'," he reassured himself. "The law\r\nsays I gotta have a chance at rehabilitation whether I co-operate or\r\nnot. I didn\'t make up the law, but I can use it as much as he can. He\r\nwouldn\'t dare overgas me!"\r\n\r\nHis anger helped him start out at a brisk pace. In less than three\r\nhours, he reached an area of rough, cliff-broken hills where there were\r\ncaves that would take Trolla weeks to check. There he concealed himself\r\nfor the night.\r\n\r\nSometime during the darkness, a distant rumble awakened him.\r\n\r\nSuspiciously, Quasmin poked his head out of the cave in which he had\r\nbeen sleeping. He was just in time to see the flare of rockets in the\r\nstarry sky.\r\n\r\n"He backed down!" was his triumphant conclusion.\r\n\r\nHe watched the flaring light until he was satisfied that Trolla was\r\nmaking for space and not for another landing place. Then he returned to\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nJust to be sure, Quasmin remained in the hills two more days, until his\r\nsupplies ran low and he thought it might be comfortable to return to\r\nthe hut. He made his way back warily, lest Trolla should have left some\r\nsort of trap.\r\n\r\nAt the shack, he found nothing but his own things, so he hiked through\r\nthe purplish shrubbery to the landing spot. To his surprise, he\r\ndiscovered that Trolla had left a number of crates behind. He sat down\r\nto think that over.\r\n\r\nWhen no explanation occurred to him, he went to the wreck of his own\r\nship. In the partly stripped control room were a few instruments that\r\nstill functioned when he hooked up batteries to power them.\r\n\r\n"Might be smart to see if he\'s in orbit," he muttered. "Maybe he thinks\r\nhe can soften me up by leaving presents."\r\n\r\nEmerging an hour later, he looked puzzled. As much by luck as by\r\nskill and accuracy, he had succeeded in picking up Trolla\'s ship on\r\nthe rangefinder. The instrument was not meant to operate efficiently\r\nthrough an atmosphere and Quasmin was no expert in its use; but it\r\ndefinitely showed Trolla was heading out-system.\r\n\r\n"Well, then, I might as well see if he left a bomb," decided Quasmin.\r\n\r\nHe approached the crates close enough to read the stenciled labels.\r\nScowling in bewilderment, he set about opening them. Just as the\r\nlettering indicated, he found an assortment of electric motors,\r\nequipment for building a new generator that could be powered by his\r\nwaterwheel, and even a supply of glow-panels for light if he should get\r\nan electrical system into operation.\r\n\r\nThere was also a chest of tools and parts, and several boxes of grain\r\nand vegetable seeds. The prize of all was a small, three-wheeled,\r\nbattery-powered vehicle that looked just large enough to pull a\r\nhomemade plow.\r\n\r\nThe man sat on an open crate and burst into hysterical laughter.\r\n\r\n"All a bluff!" he chortled. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
"I _knew_ he didn\'t dare do anything!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was after he staggered to his feet to haul the little machine from\r\nits crate that he found Trolla\'s note attached to the handlebar.\r\n\r\n    _Dear Quasmin_, it said. _As you tried to point out, there is some\r\n    argument whether a society has any moral right to punish a criminal\r\n    or merely an obligation to help him heal himself._\r\n\r\nQuasmin roared with laughter. He looked up at the clear sky.\r\n\r\n"That\'s right, Trolla! I\'m _sick_--an\' don\'t you forget it!"\r\n\r\n    _On the other hand_, he read on, _an individual owes support to\r\n    the society that protects his rights. I think a breach of the\r\n    contract by one party nullifies it for the other too. Think that\r\n    over--Trolla._\r\n\r\nQuasmin scowled at the words, then at the sky, and finally at the tools\r\nand materials that would help maintain him on this strange planet for\r\nmany years.\r\n\r\n"Years and years and years," he muttered, glancing about at the\r\nhanging, purplish fronds in the silent background.\r\n\r\nA stunned expression crept over his face, as he realized what kind of\r\nsentence had been passed upon him.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
