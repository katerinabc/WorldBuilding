The first is solar history; the second, the\r\nmostly true legend of a misfit called Knucklebone Smith.\r\n\r\nKnucklebone, so far as anyone could ever determine, was his real\r\nname--the sin of prankish, or perhaps disillusioned parents. He was\r\nexactly six feet eight inches tall from the insulated soles of his\r\nengineering boots to the top of his planeteer\'s helmet. He never in\r\nhis life weighed more than one hundred sixty-five pounds. His face was\r\nangular and horse-like, and it had never, within the memory of anyone\r\nwho knew him, contained the slightest vestige of a smile.\r\n\r\nHe was not nature\'s first error, nor her last, but he differed from the\r\nunexceptional many in that he believed in Destiny ... with a capital\r\n\'L.\' Throughout a lifetime of unfortunate ventures he remained firm in\r\nthe conviction that sooner or later he would find his own metier and\r\nbecome famous. At last he did, and that is the story of Knucklebone\r\nSmith.\r\n\r\nThe Pluto Lamp, a relic of the pioneering days of interstellar flight,\r\nis harder to explain, but easier to believe. It was once as well known\r\nto spacemen as Rafferty Shoals to the ancient China clippers.\r\n\r\nThe gulf between the stars was vast and uncharted in those days; still\r\na thing of superstitious dread for the planet-bound. But it was no more\r\nunknown than the solitary planet which tails all the others in its\r\ndark, millennial path about our own sun. The planetary freighters went\r\nas far as Uranus and no farther. For the black little planet whose very\r\nnamesake is Hell had nothing to attract them that could not be gotten\r\nat more conveniently.\r\n\r\nThe starships passed it by warily, giving it a wide berth, for it had\r\nan evil reputation. The old scanners were unreliable at best, what with\r\nthe confusing debris that fills space, and more than one ship, through\r\nmiscalculation, swerved from its course, brushing through the magnetic\r\nfield of the unillumined wasteland, and crashed on the hard frozen\r\nsurface of Pluto.\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable that someone would give birth to the idea of the\r\nLamp. It was to be a permanent, unmanned beacon, strategically placed\r\non the Dead Planet to warn ships that should have passed in the night,\r\nbut didn\'t always make it.\r\n\r\nA magnificent idea, everyone thought. Everyone, that is, excepting\r\nKnucklebone Smith.\r\n\r\nThe very idea of Pluto made him ill. He had set his number twelve\r\nsize feet on all the inner planets at one time or another in the\r\ndisillusioning search for fortune. He had starved and thirsted, baked\r\nand bled for his dream. But he had always hated and avoided cold. He\r\nhad, in fact, the look of a man born cold, and never entirely warmed.\r\n\r\nIt was the most outrageous kind of irony, therefore, that fate, and the\r\nCommission of Galactic Astrography, should select him to light the Lamp.\r\n\r\nThe latter, at least, was innocent of paradoxical motive. They needed\r\na man like Smith. A man planet-wise enough to do the job, and not\r\nintelligent enough to decline it. There would be another man along, of\r\ncourse, to direct, but he presented no problem, for he was Professor\r\nSalvor-Jones, who had invented the Light, and insisted upon being along\r\nwhen it was installed. He was a dedicated man.\r\n\r\nKnucklebone Smith, however, was dedicated to something else, and it\r\nwas only his pressing need for money that prodded him into acceptance\r\nof the offer. He didn\'t care a fig for the safety of starships. This\r\nwould be a dangerous job at best, decidedly unpleasant at worst. Smith\r\ndidn\'t mind the danger; he had seen much of it in his wanderings; but\r\nof unpleasantness he had experienced even more, and being a sybarite\r\nby nature, in spite of his hard life, he preferred real (but painless)\r\nperil. He was sure that he would be cold on Pluto. He was right.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe lamp was not really a light, of course, nor did it faintly resemble\r\none. What it did, in fact, resemble, was a sleek space cruiser. This\r\nwas wholly misleading, for though it was designed for interplanetary\r\ntravel, it was to be a one-way voyage. Once in the orbit of Pluto\r\nit would nose down, smash a few feet into the crystalline surface\r\nof frozen ammonia, and remain there forever, standing on end like a\r\nlighthouse. It was at this point that it would cease to be a spaceship\r\nand become a beacon.\r\n\r\nAt least that was what Professor Salvor-Jones said.\r\n\r\nThe beacon was three hundred feet long, white in color, for some\r\nmysterious reason, and had cost the government of Earth something less\r\nthan seventeen million dollars. It was packed with expensive robotic\r\nequipment, and was designed to be completely self-sustaining, once its\r\ncontrols were properly set. It did everything for passing starships\r\nthat could possibly be expected of a well-reared beacon. It cheered\r\nthem on the outward passage, making them feel less lonely. It greeted\r\nthem, like a remote, cold Statue of Liberty upon their return, warned\r\nthem of lurking meteorite storms within the vicinity of their course,\r\nand advised them of their position with relation to their destination\r\nwhen they contacted its sensitive radio. But most important, it warned\r\nthem to steer clear of Pluto.\r\n\r\nIt very nearly failed before it had begun all this show of monkish\r\nwayside hospitality, however. It would have failed if it hadn\'t been\r\nfor Knucklebone Smith.\r\n\r\nThey cut the beaconship loose from its convoy five hundred miles out,\r\nwhich was sufficient for it to spiral in on the minimum of power it\r\ncarried and land safely.\r\n\r\nSalvor-Jones and Smith had only to lie in their safety hammocks in the\r\ncramped temporary passenger cubicle. The ship would land by itself.\r\nTheir duties began once it had established itself firmly on the bleak\r\nexpanse of dark planet below them. They were to adjust the automatic\r\ncontrols, make tests, and generally see that the thing was as it should\r\nbe for the lonely vigil that lay ahead.\r\n\r\nThree weeks, Salvor-Jones indicated, should be plenty of time for all\r\nthis. When it was finished, they could send a patrol cruiser from\r\nGanymede to pick them up.\r\n\r\nThat was what he said but he was a very zealous man, and doted on\r\nthoroughness.\r\n\r\nThe fact was that they were finished with the tests in seven and a half\r\nhours, and there was nothing to do, unhappily, for the remaining twenty\r\ndays except to entertain themselves as best they could, and wait. It\r\nmight be said that things went too smoothly.\r\n\r\nProfessor Salvor-Jones was a smallish man with a square mustache of\r\nregulation black, and a lock of jet hair that hung at times over his\r\nleft eye. He had a perpetual motion machine built into him, and a\r\nprofound contempt for the normal pace of life.\r\n\r\nBut worst of all, in view of his predicament, he had Knucklebone Smith.\r\n\r\nSalvor-Jones finished his checking at 1800 star time and came into the\r\nliving compartment from the chill outer ship, or beacon, as it had now\r\nbecome. He blew on his hands, put away his check-sheet board, and stood\r\nuncertainly, gnawing his thumb and gazing at the spectacle of Smith\r\nhunkered silently in front of a portable radiant heater. Knucklebone\r\nwas, as usual, the picture of contemplative suicide.\r\n\r\n"Well, well," said Salvor-Jones briskly.\r\n\r\nSmith made no answer. He swallowed thoughtfully, his Adam\'s apple\r\nconvulsing, and continued to stare into the glowing sun of the heater.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve not much to do from now on, I\'m afraid," Salvor-Jones said,\r\n"until a starship passes within range. Then we\'ll be able to see how\r\nwell it works."\r\n\r\nSmith nodded glumly. He was sulking. He had been assigned to assist,\r\nbut this little man insisted on doing everything himself. Didn\'t trust\r\na damn soul but himself. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
Pick up a tool and like as not he\'d snatch it\r\nfrom your hand and leave you standing there watching him. Smith hated\r\npeople like that.\r\n\r\n"Play chess?" Salvor-Jones asked.\r\n\r\n"I never played chess," Knucklebone Smith said.\r\n\r\n"Quite an assortment of games on board," Salvor-Jones said. "Checkers.\r\nMaybe you\'d rather play checkers."\r\n\r\n"Never tried it."\r\n\r\n"Poker?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\nSalvor-Jones sighed. He got out the animated slide pictures, set up the\r\nscreen, and amused himself at length. The slides were mostly those of\r\nlightly clad females in warm climates, doing pleasantly idle things.\r\n\r\nAfter the second slide, Knucklebone switched his chair around so that\r\nhis back was to the screen. The girls made him feel too sentimental.\r\nThe blue skies and golden beaches made him homesick.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the fifth day Knucklebone Smith was fiddling with a power switch\r\nand blew out a safety fuse. It required some three hours for Professor\r\nSalvor-Jones to repair it, but he was glad for the diversion.\r\n\r\nOn the eighth day Smith was pottering in the pile room with an electric\r\ntorch, making himself a wire bookrack. A lubrication reservoir caught\r\non fire and a minor generator was ruined.\r\n\r\nOn the eleventh day he dropped a hammer from the fidley of the power\r\nroom to the floor, a hundred feet below. A gas line was smashed.\r\nSalvor-Jones put on a gas mask and went down to fix it. It took quite a\r\nlong while.\r\n\r\nOn the fourteenth day, without the slightest pretext, Salvor-Jones\r\ncalled Knucklebone Smith a meddling fool. Smith hit him once and that\r\nwas that. They didn\'t speak to each other for four days.\r\n\r\nThe meteor storm came only three days before their exile was to end. On\r\nPluto, where the frozen atmosphere lies inert on the surface, there was\r\nnothing to stop the rain of debris from space. It sounded like sporadic\r\nhail on the tough metal hull of the beacon, and their scopes showed the\r\nmass to be more than a million miles in width, streaming in from the\r\ndirection of Orion.\r\n\r\nSalvor-Jones was worried. There was a tiny blip in the lower corner\r\nof the solar coordinate on the radar screen; a blip that occulted\r\nwith alternating brightness and dimness, in a pattern of unnatural\r\nregularity. A ship!\r\n\r\nHer radio came in an hour later. She announced her name, _Luna Star_,\r\nand destination, Alpha Centauri. The hail of stones from space was\r\ngetting worse. The beacon was built to stand such stress, but a\r\nstarship, meeting them head on--!\r\n\r\nIt was a dangerous situation.\r\n\r\nWithin the Pluto Lamp a hundred relays clicked and buzzed. Automatic\r\nswitches closed. The power pack, deep in the body of the beacon hummed\r\nwith sudden power. Even Knucklebone Smith seemed slightly interested.\r\nBut nothing happened.\r\n\r\nThe ship\'s signal came in loud and clear once more. "This is _Luna\r\nStar_. Come in, robot station Pluto Lamp. Come in Pluto Lamp."\r\n\r\nSalvor-Jones sprang for the manual switch and flicked it on. "_Luna\r\nStar_," he screamed, "Do you read me? This is Pluto Lamp. Do you read\r\nme?"\r\n\r\n"This is _Luna Star_. We understand the robot station is now in\r\noperation, but manned. Come in if you are there."\r\n\r\n"_Luna Star_, do you read me?" They waited a long, tense minute. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
There\r\nwas no answer. "We\'re not getting through," Salvor-Jones said.\r\n\r\nKnucklebone cleared his throat. "There\'s a red light on over at the\r\nemergency panel. Would that have anything to do with it?"\r\n\r\n"You imbecile!" Salvor-Jones said, "Why didn\'t you say so. It\'s the\r\nantenna. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
I knew it. I knew there\'d be trouble with the antenna! A\r\nmeteorite must have damaged it."\r\n\r\n"I guess this thing ain\'t going to work," Knucklebone said. "We\'ve been\r\nhere only a couple of weeks, and look what happens. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
I never thought it\r\nwould be any good anyway."\r\n\r\nSalvor-Jones bared his teeth. "There isn\'t a storm like this one every\r\ntwenty-five years," he growled. "Don\'t sit there; we\'ve got to go up on\r\nthe dome. No! 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Stay where you are. I don\'t want this job botched." He\r\nbegan to struggle into his exposure suit.\r\n\r\n"If the _Star_ hits it head-on there\'ll be hell to pay," Knucklebone\r\nsaid diffidently. "I was in one of these storms once before on an\r\nold crate out in the Belt." He got up and stretched his spidery frame\r\nlanguidly. Then he went over and took down his impossibly long exposure\r\nsuit from its hook.\r\n\r\n"What are you doing?" Salvor-Jones said.\r\n\r\n"Guess I\'ll go with you."\r\n\r\n"You\'re going to play hell," Professor Salvor-Jones said in an\r\nunscholarly manner. "What good could you possibly be?"\r\n\r\nThere was a steely glint in Knucklebone Smith\'s eyes. Later on, at the\r\ninquiry, Salvor-Jones testified concerning that glint. "Listen," Smith\r\nsaid, "I guess I\'m sick and tired of you trying to play the big hero\r\nall alone on this here tub. A body would think I was a moron. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
They\r\npicked me out of millions, didn\'t they? That\'s Destiny. I guess you\r\nhaven\'t thought about it, but everybody\'s got a Destiny--something they\r\ncan do better than anybody else. Everybody\'s good at something." It was\r\na long speech for Knucklebone Smith. There were two red spots of anger\r\non his sallow cheeks.\r\n\r\n"So I\'ve heard," Salvor-Jones said wryly. "Well, come along, but don\'t\r\nsay I didn\'t warn you. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
It may be the end of us, you know."\r\n\r\nKnucklebone snorted. He had walked in the shadow of death before. A man\r\nhad his destiny. Something worthwhile to perform before he kicked off.\r\nAnd if he had ever done anything worthwhile he couldn\'t remember it. He\r\nzipped up his suit and reached for his helmet.\r\n\r\nThe roof hatch, massively armored, opened noiselessly on its hydraulic\r\nsupports. The coldness rushed at them, and could not be entirely shut\r\nout by the suits. Smith shivered throughout his long, skinny body.\r\n\r\nClambering out on the roof of the beacon they became aware of what\r\nseemed like a strong wind, but what was, in reality, microscopic\r\ninterstellar dust from the storm, traveling at supersonic speed,\r\nflattening their suits against them.\r\n\r\nHere and there a pea-sized pebble clanged against the metal hull like a\r\nbullet. Crouching in the shelter of the antenna tower, they scanned its\r\nnaked ribs of steel alloy for a break.\r\n\r\nAt last Salvor-Jones, who knew what he was looking for, found it, six\r\nfeet up, where a meteorite had smashed into the coaxial and shorted it\r\nagainst the frame. He climbed up and went to work, cursing to himself\r\nin his helmet as the death missiles hurtled about him.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Salvor-Jones that he had been up there forever, with one\r\nleg draped over a brace, clumsily working with his heavy gloves. The\r\ncold was seeping in more and more in spite of the fact that it could\r\nnot have been more than half an hour from the time of his ascent.\r\n\r\nHe clambered down at last, beating his hands together to restore\r\ncirculation.\r\n\r\nKnucklebone Smith, who had done nothing, leaned against the tower\r\non the storm side. He was staring fixedly at something out in that\r\nperpetual night. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
But there was nothing to see. Only the faint glow of\r\nthe bluish-white methane crystals, swirling through the frozen gullies\r\nof the rugged terrain; sweeping around the dark ridges as they were\r\nagitated by the driving stellar dust.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll be killed out there," Salvor-Jones said into his mike. "Get\r\nbehind something, quick!"\r\n\r\nSmith said nothing. He just stood there, with his back to Salvor-Jones,\r\ncontemplating the horizon as the storm rippled his uniform. His\r\nposition had not shifted a fraction of an inch. It was this fact\r\nthat frightened Salvor-Jones suddenly. He caught his breath, and\r\ncrept around the edge of the shelter. He reached out and shook his\r\nassistant\'s arm.\r\n\r\nKnucklebone Smith did not move. There was a gaping hole in the side of\r\nhis helmet where a rock had struck. He had frozen to death, standing up.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA sudden flurry of unseen particles buffeted Salvor-Jones and bowled\r\nhim over. Something big smashed against the roof hatch with such force\r\nthat the entire beacon shuddered. The lid of the hatch, its braces torn\r\nfrom under it, clanged shut. Then the sudden gust abated.\r\n\r\nSalvor-Jones crawled over to the escape hatch and looked at it. It was\r\nslightly askew; there was plenty of room to get his hands under the\r\nedge of it. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
He tugged manfully in an effort to slide it aside enough to\r\nadmit him, but in vain. It weighed more than half a ton.\r\n\r\nHe pried at it with his adjustable wrench but it wouldn\'t budge. He\r\nlooked around for something longer. There was nothing.\r\n\r\nProfessor Salvor-Jones realized that he was going to die on Pluto. He\r\nwished that he believed in prayer.\r\n\r\nHe read the gage of his heating unit. Not much longer.\r\n\r\nHe sat down on the hatch, heedless of the silent flak about him. He\r\nenvied Knucklebone Smith over there; the man had never known what hit\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nKnucklebone was still standing there, tall against the night, rigidly\r\nleaning against the superstructure, an impossible caricature of death.\r\n\r\nSomething clicked in Salvor-Jones\'s brain. One faint, mad hope. He\r\ncrawled over and tugged at Smith\'s legs. The tall corpse came crashing\r\ndown on top of him.\r\n\r\nHe seized one unyielding foot, a big, all-important, boot-clad foot\r\nthat stuck out at just the right angle, and began to drag Knucklebone\r\nacross the width of the dome.\r\n\r\nThe _Lunar Star_ got through safely. It was turned aside by a last\r\nminute warning from the Pluto Lamp beacon. This impressed the\r\nimportance of the Lamp in the minds of the authorities, as is attested\r\nto by history, for it was in service well over one hundred years after\r\nSalvor-Jones\'s ordeal.\r\n\r\nIn Selena City there is a small monument, equally dedicated to the\r\ntwo heroes, Salvor-Jones and Smith. For the professor declared that\r\nSmith had been as much responsible for the success of the Lamp as he,\r\nhimself. Hadn\'t he saved the day, there at the very last?\r\n\r\nAs for Knucklebone Smith, his frozen body still lies in simple state on\r\nPluto. There is a faint, fixed smile on his face; or presumably there\r\nis, for Salvor-Jones attests that it was there that night. And it can\r\nhardly have escaped him now.\r\n\r\nFor it was just as Knucklebone had always said. Every man is good for\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\nEven if it is only to be used for a lever.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
