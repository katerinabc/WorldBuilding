]\r\n\r\n\r\nRight then he was the scaredest he\'d ever been in his life. Yet even as\r\nhe watched the spaceship turning within the glow of its flaring jets,\r\nhe kept thinking of his father\'s warning:\r\n\r\n"A boy\'s duty, son, is to keep his eyes and ears open and to give the\r\nalarm. We must be alerted ... or we\'re doomed."\r\n\r\nIt had been drummed into him ever since the landing and explosion of\r\nthe rockets. He\'d been very little then and it was hard to understand.\r\nBut they\'d explained it carefully--over and over again.\r\n\r\nThe rockets were a test. They\'d been fired by beings on another planet.\r\nSome day the beings themselves would come to invade.\r\n\r\nHe\'d often thought about it--especially at night in bed. And he\'d\r\ndreamed about it, too. Horrible dreams. And now the dreams had come\r\ntrue!\r\n\r\nTrembling, he watched the silver hulk aim its jets at the ground and\r\nbegin to come down. It slipped past him with a roar. Its fires reddened\r\nthe hillside. It settled with a jarring thud. Then all was silence.\r\n\r\nEdging forward, he peered down into the glen. The dust and smoke was\r\nclearing and he could see most of the ship gleaming evilly in the\r\ntwilight....\r\n\r\nOthers, he thought, must have seen or heard the landing. Soon they\'d\r\ncome to fight off the invaders. He\'d be found, quivering with fear, and\r\nbranded a coward. He must do something....\r\n\r\nA sudden metallic clanging made him jump. A light flicked on. He sucked\r\na deep breath. The beings!\r\n\r\nThey stood on a platform next to a trap-door. Three of them: squat,\r\nfat, and silvery-white ... like the insects he often found under flat\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nOne held the light. The other two carried strange looking boxes. They\r\nmade their way down a ladder and began to set up the boxes on the\r\nground. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
This was his chance, he told himself. While they were busy, he\r\ncould climb to the top of the hill and escape down the other side.\r\n\r\nBut he\'d only taken three steps when he stubbed his toe on a rock,\r\njarred it loose, and sent it pelting into the glen.\r\n\r\nThey hurried over to see what it was and he got a better look at them.\r\nTheir wrinkled skin hung from their bulgy bodies in thick folds. Insect\r\nfeelers waved over their humped backs. Flat expressionless faces\r\nglittered in the light of their lamp.... He shuddered.\r\n\r\nAfter they\'d looked at the rock, two of them started climbing in the\r\ndirection from which it had rolled. The third stayed behind, beaming\r\nthe light to guide the way.\r\n\r\nCringing against the hill, he moved along the ledge to a point where it\r\ncurled past a jutting crag. On the other side of that he\'d be hidden\r\nfrom view and could make a run for it.\r\n\r\nBut as soon as he\'d made it, he gasped, horror-stricken.... The vague\r\nshadow of the ledge pinched inward till it became the gulfing black of\r\na sheer cliff. He was trapped!\r\n\r\nHis only hope now was the coming of the town people and he listened\r\nfor noises of their approach. But all he heard was the scuffle of two\r\nbeings cresting the ledge.\r\n\r\nWas it possible that he alone knew of the landing? The town people\r\nshould have come by now.\r\n\r\nAs it was, a lot of lives depended on him. His father and mother, the\r\nother kids, and all the people, too. He couldn\'t let them down!\r\n\r\nThe beam of light, moving along the ledge ahead of the two beings, now\r\ntouched the crag and spilled over to where he stood. Then, almost as\r\nif Fate had taken charge again, his eyes were drawn to the gleam of a\r\nsharp-edged rock....\r\n\r\nHe was gripping it, poised to strike, when the first of the beings came\r\naround the bend.\r\n\r\nTwo things made him hesitate. First, size. The being was tiny--fully a\r\nthird shorter than himself.\r\n\r\nNext, the way the being acted. It had stopped and raised its hand, palm\r\nout, as if trying to make friends.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt must be a trick, he told himself. Never had he heard the beings\r\nspoken of as friends--only as vicious destroyers. He took a tighter\r\ngrip on the rock.\r\n\r\nNow he noticed something that filled him with a new loathing. He\'d been\r\nwrong about their appearance. The sagging skin was really a bulky suit.\r\nThe big head a helmet. And back of the helmet\'s face he could see the\r\nactual being. He felt like vomiting.\r\n\r\nHe bashed the rock against the faceplate. It webbed with a cluster of\r\ntiny cracks. He struck again and again, until the helmet split open and\r\nhe was pulping the face itself to a reddish smear....\r\n\r\nSuddenly a roaring filled his ears. His side was laced with terrible\r\npain. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
He reeled backward. Saw the second of the beings pointing at him\r\nwith something long and rodlike. He flipped the rock.\r\n\r\nIt caught the being in the chest and drove it over the side. He could\r\nsee it clawing the air all the way down to the glen.\r\n\r\nThere, the third being, with the light, took one look at the still\r\nform, turned and raced madly for the ship.\r\n\r\nWatching, he was overcome with a peculiar feeling of excitement. The\r\npain in his side had ebbed and he felt hot and feverish. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
He wanted to\r\ndo something--to act. Without thinking, he scurried down the hill and\r\ntook after the fleeing figure.\r\n\r\nHe caught it on the ladder, just below the trap-door, grabbed its leg,\r\nand jerked. It plunged to the ground and hit with a crash. The light\r\nblinked out.\r\n\r\nNow he heard a thin grating noise. Above him the trap-door, dimly\r\noutlined by a light from a cubbyhole beyond, had begun to move. He\r\nswung himself to the platform, dove into the cubbyhole, and heard the\r\ntrap clang shut behind him.\r\n\r\nStraight ahead was a short length of ladder and overhanging it a second\r\ntrap-door which had already begun to gape open. This, he guessed, was\r\nsome sort of air-lock--a way of getting in and out of the ship without\r\nlosing the built up pressure. It would account for the suits worn on\r\nthe outside.\r\n\r\nThe trap had swung wider and he could see two beings in suits getting\r\nready to come down. They probably were trying to help their buddies.\r\n\r\nHe got the first one as it started down the ladder with its back to\r\nhim. He just threw an arm around its helmet and pulled until he heard a\r\nsnap.\r\n\r\nThen he went up the ladder to get at the second one. He hit it, watched\r\nit spin across the chamber, crunch against the bulkhead, and collapse.\r\n\r\nNow a third one darted away from a bank of levers and tried to reach\r\nthe spiral stairs, rising to the next level. It wore no suit and its\r\nthin body made him think of some horrible creeping plant. He leapt for\r\nit, clutched the skinny neck with one hand, and squeezed.\r\n\r\nHe rushed to the bank of levers, then, and pushed one after another\r\nuntil he heard the scraping of the lower trap-door and the hiss of\r\nescaping air.\r\n\r\nWhen he climbed to the upper levels, all the beings were dead except\r\ntwo. He found a short piece of metal and hit them both on the head.\r\n\r\nAnd now his side had begun to ache and he felt bruised and shaky and\r\nvery weary. He must get back to town ... tell them what he\'d done ...\r\nbring them to look....\r\n\r\nBut he should take something back with him to prove the ship was there.\r\nHe noticed a bright piece of metal sunk into the bulkhead. It was\r\ncovered with symbols ... a sort of nameplate.\r\n\r\nGrasping it with the thin, flat part of two hands, he braced himself\r\nagainst the bulkhead with his other two hands and ripped it loose.\r\n\r\nOn the way back, he memorized the shape of the symbols. He might want\r\nto draw them sometime to show off:\r\n\r\n_Taggert Steel Company, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.A._\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
