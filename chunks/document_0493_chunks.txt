But someone,\r\n           somewhere, made this batch too perfect. Caffrey,\r\n         big tough Caffrey laughed out loud at the tremendous\r\n             irony of the joke as he pondered sending his\r\n            ravaged ship into the burning maw of the sun._\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n                     Planet Stories January 1952.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCaffrey slammed the great steel doors and walked forward through the\r\ngym. His bare feet slapped on the mats and the cane of iron-hard\r\nVenus jungle wood swung lightly in one hand. He wore only dirty white\r\ntrousers. Sweat stood shiny on him under the glow of the ceiling\r\nlights. He cursed the ship silently for being old and run down and\r\nwithout any cooling units.\r\n\r\nHis beefy face moved from side to side, watching. The black eyes took\r\nin every bit of movement. He saw all that went on. It was his ticket\r\nout of the stinking world of frozen-starred space, of Class nine\r\nfreighters and unholy cargos.\r\n\r\nThe slender blue-gray androids were exercising. They vaulted on the\r\nparallel bars, dangled from the rings, worked with the pulleys. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
Even\r\nthe women and the children exercised. They did not sweat, because their\r\nbodies were not made for perspiration, but Caffrey could see their\r\nmuscles twisting and shivering under the slate hides, developing.\r\n\r\nA strange kind of noise filled the vast gym. Muted gruntings, whispers\r\nof breath, solid slaps of hands and bodies on bars and mats. The\r\nandroids did not look at Caffrey. They were accustomed to slavery. They\r\nknew they had been dead when they were born.\r\n\r\nCaffrey stopped walking. Near the left wall, two android males were\r\nconversing. They leaned indolently, tiredly, against the brown wooden\r\nbars. Caffrey\'s face lost its flabbiness, becoming stripped of\r\neverything but purpose.\r\n\r\nHe walked toward them, conscious of his own strength. The exercising of\r\nthe others went on around him. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Slap and soft wind of breath and creak\r\nof apparatus. The heat was a nearly-tangible cloud.\r\n\r\n"Why aren\'t you two working out like the rest?" Caffrey asked slowly.\r\n\r\nOne of the androids said in a weary voice, "I\'m tired. I can\'t when I\'m\r\ntired.

=== Chunk 4 ===
"\r\n\r\nCaffrey\'s fingers tightened on the stick. They had to be in perfect\r\nshape! _Had to be!_ This was his last shipload, and by God....\r\n\r\nHe swung the stick up over his shoulder and brought it down in a\r\nblurring arc. There was a flat smacking sound. The android choked.\r\nCaffrey struck the other one, and the anger came up from his stomach\r\nlike fire boiling over. He screamed at them and beat them. Again the\r\nstick fell, again, again, again....\r\n\r\nFinally he stood back, feeling the sweat running down him. He tilted\r\nhis head and gulped air. "Now," he said very quietly, "now, you inhuman\r\nsonsofslate, start working...."\r\n\r\nThe two of them watched from the gray mats where they were crouched.\r\nBrief resentment was in their eyes.\r\n\r\nCaffrey bunched his muscles and kicked. The android\'s head snapped\r\nbackward against the bars. He grunted. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Then both of them got up and\r\nwalked over to the pulleys. They began to exercise, rapidly.\r\n\r\nCaffrey laughed and walked on through the gym, not watching them any\r\nmore. He went through the next bulkhead and spun the lock wheel, then\r\npadded down the corridor under the ceiling lights that shone like foggy\r\nblue eyes.\r\n\r\nDillman, his astrogator, a young kid with yellow hair and an aggressive\r\njaw, was in the chart room. He was working with the course computer.\r\nDillman had been a student at the University of Venus, Cloud City, when\r\nhe killed an officer of the Control Police in a fight over a girl.\r\nDillman was good in the slave game. Dillman was getting hard.\r\n\r\nCaffrey closed the door. It clanged loudly. Dillman looked around.\r\n\r\n"Hello, Captain," he said. "We\'re right on course. Mars in six hours,\r\nfourteen minutes."\r\n\r\nCaffrey nodded, slumping down into a thickly padded shock chair. Beyond\r\nthe wide observation window, space made endless black, and stars\r\nhung there like pieces of a broken diamond. The swollen ball of the\r\nsun burned above the ship, and Mars lay scarlet, just ahead. Distant\r\nrumbling from the old corroded jet tubes filled the room.\r\n\r\n"How\'s everything?" Caffrey asked. "Engines?"\r\n\r\n"All right," Dillman said, leaning against the astrogation table. "Few\r\npieces of stuff failed to fission awhile back, but everything\'s okay\r\nnow."\r\n\r\nCaffrey waved his hand. "Get out the bottle."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDillman grinned and pulled open a green metal wall cabinet. He filled\r\ntwo tumblers with the syrupy swamp wine and handed one of the glasses\r\nto Caffrey. The captain of the ship drank half, breathed loudly, and\r\nemptied the glass.\r\n\r\nHe hunched deeper into the shock chair, resting. "I\'ll be glad when\r\nit\'s over, Dillman. Really glad."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean that, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Hell yes, I mean it. In this business you\'ve got to be tough. But\r\nI\'ll be damned if a man can go on kicking people around all the time.\r\nSomeplace, he\'s got to stop. Well, this trip\'ll make my pile and I can\r\nstop. Got a job waiting, shuttling passengers to the Temple Ruins west\r\nof Red Sands on Mars."\r\n\r\n"This isn\'t any party," Dillman admitted. "Slavery\'s a funny thing. I\r\nthought it went out a long time back, but everybody on Earth is making\r\nsuch mental advances ..." he pointed at his skull and grinned wryly\r\n"... that they just haven\'t got any time to do any real work. And of\r\ncourse, these poor wastrels we\'ve got on board aren\'t really human\r\nbeings. How do they make them, Cap?"\r\n\r\nCaffrey shrugged. "God knows. The Globulars on Centauri four turn them\r\nout by the hundreds. Almost as good as human beings.\r\n\r\n"They have kids, they get sick, they get mad, and they don\'t mind\r\nworking. They don\'t know what else to do." He sighed, watching the\r\ncircle of Mars beginning to grow big and bloated and red beyond the\r\nwindow. "Although it\'s one hell of a job to put muscle on them."\r\n\r\nDillman poured out some more liquor and raised his glass. His eyes were\r\nbits of hard rock. "Here\'s to the last trip, Cap. And I only hope the\r\nbig boys of Workers, Incorporated, give me this ship."\r\n\r\nCaffrey nodded and drank.\r\n\r\nA green sign flashed over a bank of machinery. END OF EXERCISE PERIOD,\r\nit blinked, END OF EXERCISE PERIOD, END OF....\r\n\r\nRising, Caffrey walked to the machinery, pulled a large leather-handled\r\nswitch. He visualized with pleasure the great doors opening, and the\r\nandroids, the artificial humans, stumbling back into the dim stinking\r\nholds to wait quietly on the last stage of the trip before the chains\r\nclosed on them. Caffrey laughed out loud.\r\n\r\n"Dirty joke?" Dillman asked, faintly anxious.\r\n\r\n"No. Just thinking about what I\'ll get paid. Two thousand solars. Why\r\nman, that\'s enough to live on for years! Plenty of wine, and an easy\r\njob, and women, bless \'em."\r\n\r\nDillman started to reply when the com system rattled. The big man moved\r\nto the machine and pressed the button.\r\n\r\n"Caffrey, bridge," he growled. "What the hell is...."\r\n\r\nA quiet voice cut him off, deadly, precise like a small knife slicing\r\ninto him. "Captain, this is Doc. I\'m down in the android hold. You\'d\r\nbetter come right away."\r\n\r\n"Doc," Caffrey began, but the machine clicked off. He slammed it with\r\nhis fists. "Doc, damn it, Doc...." There was only the faraway rumble of\r\nthe ship\'s great iron heart.\r\n\r\nHe swung around, heading for the door. "Come on," he said quickly.\r\n"Nothing\'s going to happen. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Not on this run. Nothing...."\r\n\r\nThey ran through the halls under the blue lights, clambered down the\r\nladders, ran through more halls.\r\n\r\nAnd then they stood in front of the big black door. Caffrey turned the\r\nwheel, slowly at first, and then faster, until it spun and blurred into\r\ninvisibility. He stepped back and the doors opened.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe hold was dark and musty. In the tiers of bunks, the androids\r\nhuddled like not-quite-black shadows. They said nothing.\r\n\r\nThey watched. There was only a smell of antiseptic in the air,\r\nhealthful, clean and rotten all at the same time.\r\n\r\nCaffrey and Dillman moved through the endless rows of bunks. Farther\r\ndown, Caffrey could see Doc crouching over a low bunk, his cigarette\r\nlighter aflame. He knelt there, a small bulbous gnome of a man, with\r\nweary defeated eyes and thin hair lying over his skull. An android boy\r\nof about seven years lay on the bunk.\r\n\r\nDoc looked up as they stepped up to him.\r\n\r\nHis face was filled with the weariness of his eyes, with too many years\r\nand too much that was wrong.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Caffrey, watching him. Doc\'s lighter jumped and flared\r\nbright when he spoke.\r\n\r\n"The boy is sick," Doc said. "Very sick."\r\n\r\nCaffrey clicked his fingernails together. "Did you call me down here\r\nfor that?" There was a restless stirring from the bunks.\r\n\r\n"Certainly," Doc replied. "It might be dangerous."\r\n\r\n"What the hell\'s the matter with him?"\r\n\r\nDoc shrugged. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
"I don\'t know. How do I know what kind of diseases\r\nandroids get. Don\'t you understand what this could mean?

=== Chunk 8 ===
"\r\n\r\n"No," said Caffrey, "I don\'t." His voice hardened. "I\'m going back up\r\nto the chart room. We dock on Mars in a few hours."\r\n\r\nDoc sighed and lifted his misshapen body. "All right." He turned to a\r\nwoman near the bed. The woman\'s eyes were liquid and full of hurt. "I\r\ncan\'t do anything," Doc said. "I don\'t know what\'s the matter with\r\nhim." Caffrey felt stupid, seeing sorrow expressed for a woman who\r\nwasn\'t even human. Doc snapped his lighter closed and the circle of\r\nfire was gone. Caffrey breathed easily.\r\n\r\n"It\'s too damned dark," Dillman whispered as they moved toward the\r\ndoor. He stumbled against a bunk and swore.\r\n\r\n"Keep quiet," Doc said very softly. "Just you keep quiet."\r\n\r\nCaffrey closed the black door and passed out cigarettes. The smoke\r\nwhirled up to the ventilators like a dancing blue dragon. "Doc," he\r\nsaid, trying to control his anger, "I\'d like to know why you\'re getting\r\nso excited."\r\n\r\n"This is the first time I\'ve seen disease in an android," the little\r\nman replied. "I don\'t know whether the disease is harmful to them or\r\nnot. I mean seriously harmful. But remember what Terran scarlet fever\r\ndid on Antares second. We\'ve taken care of scarlet fever. It isn\'t\r\nfatal to us. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
But remember what it did to the people on Antares second."\r\n\r\n"Yeah," said Dillman, leaning against the wall and covering his eyes.\r\n\r\nCaffrey remembered too; the bodies and the fine yellow buildings and\r\nthe rot and the inability to stop the corruption. The system had known\r\npanic.\r\n\r\n"I see," he said. "You think whatever\'s wrong with that kid, even\r\nthough it might not bother them much, might ... kill us? Is that it?

=== Chunk 10 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Doc. He blew out some smoke.\r\n\r\nCaffrey grabbed his arm. "Nothing\'s going to happen. This cargo is\r\ngoing to Mars and nothing\'s going to happen. I\'ve worked for this a\r\nlong time. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
Understand? No sick kid is going to keep me from landing on\r\nMars."\r\n\r\n"You\'re the captain," said Doc. He shambled off down the corridor,\r\ntrailing a worm of blue smoke in the air behind him. He rounded a\r\ncorner out of sight, small and gnarled and tired of arguing. The last\r\nof the smoke vanished into the ventilators.\r\n\r\nDillman laughed gratingly with effort. "Let\'s go get the rest of that\r\nbottle, Cap."\r\n\r\n"Sure," said Caffrey.\r\n\r\nThey were three hours out from Mars when the com system came to life\r\nagain. Caffrey jumped up out of the shock chair and jabbed the switch.\r\nA nervous, excited voice came screeching at him.\r\n\r\n"Skolnik, Captain."\r\n\r\n"What\'s wrong?

=== Chunk 12 ===
"\r\n\r\n"It\'s Doc. He\'s on the floor of his cabin. He\'s ... I...."\r\n\r\n"Speak up, man!" Caffrey yelled.\r\n\r\nSkolnik\'s voice pulled itself back from shivering pieces and went\r\non, "Doc\'s lying on the floor ... and his voice is awful ... and the\r\nmuscles in his face and arms and all over him are jumping and ... oh,\r\nCaptain...."\r\n\r\n"Go on," Caffrey said savagely. "Go on!"\r\n\r\n"... and he\'s screaming, Captain, and we can\'t stop him...."\r\n\r\nCaffrey was out in the hall before the last syllable was uttered.\r\nThe bulkheads spanged open as he kicked them. His feet slap-slapped\r\nfrantically and when he was two sections away and one deck above Doc\'s\r\nquarters, he heard the screaming.\r\n\r\nIt rose and shrilled and howled and made him more afraid than he had\r\never been in his life.\r\n\r\nThe carefully acquired veneer of toughness shredded away like cheap\r\ncotton candy that was eaten at a Terran carnival and dissolved to\r\nnothing in the mouth.\r\n\r\nThe eighteen crewmen of the ship were in the hall, milling and twisting\r\ntheir caps in their hands. Skolnik stood with his back to the wall. He\r\nhad vomited on the floor and now he was crying. Caffrey was sicker when\r\nhe smelled the bitterness, but he shoved at the crewmen.\r\n\r\nThey stumbled against one another like dumb animals. Their faces\r\nbelonged to little boys on dark nights when they walked home alone.\r\n\r\nThey seemed to resist Caffrey\'s efforts, and he clubbed at them, the\r\nbreath tearing in and out of his chest. Finally, he stood with his\r\nhands on the edge of the cabin door.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHis hands had been sweating, but now he felt, actually felt, the wave\r\nof cold sweep through his fingers, up his arms.\r\n\r\nDoc was on the floor, like Skolnik had said.\r\n\r\nHis scream made an endless mad tune above the engine rumble. His body\r\nwas lifted from the floor, jerked, twisted, thrown back down again like\r\nsome fantastic, jiggling marionette on strings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Doc was on the floor. His screams made an endless, mad\r\ntune above the engine rumble._]\r\n\r\n"Doc," Caffrey called, "Doc, listen, it\'s me, Cap."\r\n\r\nThe screaming slobbered into nothing. Doc\'s hands clutched at the iron\r\nframe of his bunk. They held there while the rest of his body was\r\nconvulsed and pulled into insane contortions.\r\n\r\n"Infected," Doc said, forming his words into a shriek. "I got it from\r\nthe child ... we\'re all infected ... all ... we\'ll infect Mars ...\r\nspread ... spread ... _spread_...." The last word went up and up like\r\nthe ship\'s takeoff siren. Doc struggled to hold onto the bed but his\r\nbody went jerking away across the floor.\r\n\r\nDillman peered over Caffrey\'s shoulder. The big man spoke very softly.\r\n"Go back to my cabin. Get my gun. Hurry."\r\n\r\nDillman hesitated, then ran. Caffrey stood fascinated watching the\r\ndevil\'s dance of the diseased man. Finally, something cool and hard was\r\nplaced in his hand. The scream tore at his eardrums.\r\n\r\nQuickly he looked at the ceiling. He pushed the gun forward. He pulled\r\nthe trigger several times. The shots roared and blended with the engine\r\nthunder. When the noise was gone, Caffrey realized that the screaming\r\nhad stopped. He dropped the gun.\r\n\r\nHe turned around and closed the door of the cabin and locked it without\r\nonce looking at Doc. Skolnik still sobbed over against the wall.\r\n\r\nRapidly, Caffrey explained what had happened in the android hold. The\r\nmen stood around, not looking at one another. They breathed loudly and\r\nthe blue lights in the ceiling watched them, emotionless.\r\n\r\nCaffrey said, "We\'ll all be like that after a while."\r\n\r\n"Maybe if we beam to Mars they\'ll know what to do," Dillman whispered.\r\n"Maybe we can get there in time, and maybe they can stop the disease."\r\n\r\nCaffrey looked at him. 

=== Chunk 13 ===
"And maybe not."\r\n\r\nHe walked away. Dillman didn\'t follow. He walked back to the chart room\r\nand sat down in the shock chair. Beyond the port, Mars was large and\r\nwaiting.\r\n\r\nCaffrey thought seriously for the first time in many years. He wanted\r\nto get the ship to Mars. Maybe the doctors could help them. And maybe\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nThey might infect others. The disease might spread, and if no one knew\r\nhow to handle it ... he didn\'t want to think about that.\r\n\r\nDoc hadn\'t known what to do. Doc was a good man, medically. He had been\r\na little run down, a little second-hand, because of his seedy deals and\r\nhis need of money and his operations on women in dirty back alley rooms\r\non a hundred worlds. But Doc couldn\'t stop it.\r\n\r\nAnd sometime, Caffrey thought, alone and facing himself at last, a man\r\nhas got to stop being tough. You can\'t live with yourself forever and\r\nbe tough. Just once you\'ve got to do something for your self-respect.\r\nHe knew it, and all the cursing and shouting could not cover up the\r\nfact that he knew it.\r\n\r\nThere was a chance for them. But the chance might be deadly, more than\r\ndeadly, to Sol\'s worlds. The androids didn\'t matter. They were pieces\r\nof metal and plastic and skin, constructed to get sick, but they didn\'t\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nCaffrey laughed. _They didn\'t matter._ But they mattered when you\r\nthought of Doc being shaken to pieces in agony. Too perfectly made,\r\nthey were. He laughed out loud at the tremendous mighty irony of the\r\njoke.\r\n\r\nDillman came in the door.\r\n\r\n"What are we going to do, Captain?"\r\n\r\nCaffrey stood up and sighed. He walked to the com system. He opened\r\nit. He spoke into it for a few moments. 

=== Chunk 14 ===
He shut it off. He turned to\r\nDillman.\r\n\r\n"That\'s what we\'re going to do," he said.\r\n\r\nDillman began to yell. He hit Caffrey, pummelled at him, screamed in\r\nfear. Caffrey had to knock him down on the floor and hit him with his\r\ncane. None of the other men gave him trouble.\r\n\r\nCarefully, he moved to the course computer.\r\n\r\nHe made corrections in the directional tape. The ship began to groan.\r\nIt swung into a new course. Caffrey took one final look at Mars,\r\nthinking of the quiet days shuttling people to the Temple Ruins west of\r\nRed Sands, of the liquor and the warm, laughing women. But no more.\r\n\r\nThe sun lay dead ahead.\r\n\r\nCaffrey sat down and poured himself a drink. Then he remembered\r\nsomething. If the disease hit him, he might alter the course.\r\n\r\nHe smashed the machinery, ripping it apart with his great hands,\r\ntearing it, so that the course could never be changed. Wires lay\r\nsevered and bare all over the floor.\r\n\r\nHe picked up the bottle for another drink. The sun was a living ball of\r\nflame. He could not look at it.\r\n\r\nThe green sign went crazy. EXERCISE PERIOD, it blinked, EXERCISE....\r\n\r\nCaffrey tried to throw the bottle at it. His hand twitched. The bottle\r\nfell to the floor and broke. Caffrey looked at his hands, at the hairs\r\nwhitened with sun glow. The hand twitched again. Dillman stirred where\r\nhe lay. His leg flapped once or twice.\r\n\r\nCaffrey sat there while the heat began to melt the walls. He felt his\r\nbody writhing, but it did not matter, in the heat. There was only\r\na blinding whiteness all around. He thought about the androids. He\r\nthought about Skolnik. He thought, at last, about Mars.\r\n\r\nHe was still thinking about Mars when the ship fell into the burning\r\nmaw of the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
