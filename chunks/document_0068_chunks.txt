Former\r\n    office manager for a construction company, and a chess enthusiast,\r\n    he now writes full time and adds, "My main ambition in life is to\r\n    write SF for the next forty years!"_\r\n\r\n\r\n compatible\r\n\r\n _by ... Richard R. Smith_\r\n\r\n\r\n There are many ways--murder included--in which husbands\r\n can settle certain problems. This was even more drastic!\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge stood by the fireplace, his features twisted into a grimace.\r\n"It\'s hell, I tell you. A living hell."\r\n\r\nI sipped my drink and tried to think of a subtle way to change the\r\nsubject. I didn\'t like to hear a person\'s personal problems and every\r\ntime I visited George, he invariably complained about Helen. If it had\r\nbeen anyone else, I might have thought it wasn\'t entirely Helen\'s fault,\r\nbut George and I had been roommates in college and I knew him like a\r\nbrother. He was a person who got along with almost everyone.\r\nIntelligent, easy-going and likeable.\r\n\r\nHe lifted his glass and glared at me as if I were the guilty party.\r\n"She\'s a worry-wart," he continued. "A hypochondriac, a neurotic, an\r\nescapist, and a communist." He studied the ceiling thoughtfully. "And\r\nsometimes I think she\'s a little crazy."\r\n\r\nI tried to calm him, "Don\'t worry about it. If things get worse, get a\r\ndivorce."\r\n\r\n"Divorce, ha! She wouldn\'t give me a divorce if--"\r\n\r\nThe door opened.\r\n\r\nHelen smiled half-heartedly, her pale face quickly resuming its unhappy\r\nexpression as if it tired her facial muscles when she smiled. "Hello,\r\nEd. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
Nice to see you again."\r\n\r\n"Hello, Helen." I glanced at George and noticed he had closed his eyes\r\nas if the sight of his wife was unbearable. His lower lip was white\r\nwhere he gripped it with his teeth and I silently hoped he wouldn\'t draw\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nHelen sank into a chair and raised her skirt to reveal her right leg.\r\n"Did George tell you about my legs?" she inquired. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
She stroked the leg\r\naffectionately. "Arthritis. George grafted a new one on for me. Feels\r\nten times better."\r\n\r\nMy face blanched. The idea of replacing body parts from Banks didn\'t\r\nnauseate me. If a man is in an automobile accident and loses an arm, and\r\nthat arm can be replaced, I think that\'s marvelous. What sickened me\r\nwere the people who actually _enjoyed_ having a part of their body\r\nreplaced with a part from a criminal or corpse.\r\n\r\n"No." I sat down. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
My knees were weak. I felt short of breath. "George\r\ndidn\'t tell me. I--"\r\n\r\nShe interrupted with details of the operation. The details and list of\r\nher other ailments lasted half an hour, during which George drank\r\nsteadily and I waited for a lull so I could glance at my watch and say\r\nsomething about being late for an appointment.\r\n\r\nI saw George several times during the next few weeks. Never at his\r\nhouse. I didn\'t visit him on my own initiative because Helen, as I had\r\nseen during my last visit, had passed from the stage of being unpleasant\r\nand reached the stage of being unbearable. I didn\'t want to be around\r\nher or listen to her, and George must have realized my feelings because\r\nhe didn\'t invite me to his house for some time.\r\n\r\nBut both of us had a habit of stopping at a club on the outskirts of\r\ntown and we met there often. Each time we met, George complained. Each\r\ntime, he seemed to drink more and complain more.\r\n\r\nI worried about his job. He was a surgeon--one of the best--and a\r\nsurgeon needs good nerves and steady hands when he performs delicate\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nI urged him to get a divorce, but he said he didn\'t want one. "I love\r\nHelen," he said one time. "Well, I don\'t exactly love _Helen_, but I\r\nlove her body. It\'s like the old saying about marrying a girl because\r\nshe\'s pretty is like picking a rose by looking at the stem. We\'re all\r\ndifferent, you know, and we all have different tastes. When I first saw\r\nHelen-- Well, she\'s just right for me. To me, she looks as good as\r\nMarilyn Monroe looks to the average man. I like having her around. I\'d\r\nbe lost without her, but at the same time, she\'s changed so damned much,\r\nshe makes me sick."\r\n\r\nAnd there it was. He still wanted Helen but she had changed into a\r\npersonality that he hated. Over a period of years, she had changed into\r\na morbid hypochondriac, an unpleasant woman who enjoyed--more than\r\nanything else--such things as having one of her legs replaced and\r\nsampling the latest pills and drugs. George said he had tried to get her\r\nto see a psychiatrist but she refused. And you can\'t have a person\r\ncommitted to a mental institution because they have an unpleasant\r\npersonality!\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if there was no solution to his problem.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen, late one evening, I received a phone call from George. "Come over\r\nand have a few drinks," he said. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
"We\'ll have a party! Helen\'s changed.\r\nYou should see her!"\r\n\r\nI was interested in his problem, so I went.\r\n\r\nHelen greeted me at the door and I had the surprise of my life. At one\r\ntime, she had been beautiful, but she had faded during the past few\r\nyears. By staying indoors, she had grown pale, listless. As her\r\npersonality changed, it had also changed her features, and her eyes had\r\ndeveloped a sleepy, lifeless look, and deep lines had formed on her\r\nface.\r\n\r\nBut the Helen who greeted me that night was not like that. Her face had\r\na healthy flush, her eyes sparkled and she seemed vibrant, bubbling ...\r\njust like the Helen I had known so long ago.\r\n\r\nGeorge and I had a good time that night. He laughed and joked for the\r\nfirst time in months. We drank, talked, played chess, and then drank and\r\ntalked some more.\r\n\r\nEvery now and then, Helen would float by, a gorgeous creature, laughing\r\nat George\'s jokes, mixing our drinks, and smiling at George as if he\r\nwere the most wonderful man in the world.\r\n\r\nWhen I couldn\'t bear it any longer, I whispered, "What happened?"\r\n\r\nGeorge drained his glass and shouted across the room, "Come here,\r\nHelen!"\r\n\r\nShe came.\r\n\r\nGeorge said, "Promise not to tell anyone? It\'s very important."\r\n\r\nI couldn\'t imagine his reason for asking me that, but I said, "I\r\npromise."\r\n\r\n"Well," George explained, "I can\'t take all the credit. I\'m a fairly\r\ngood surgeon, but Lucas had the hardest job. We did it together. Do you\r\nknow Lucas? He\'s an electrical engineer ... _a genius_. He designed that\r\nelectronic calculator at--"\r\n\r\n"Show him," Helen interrupted. "_Show him!_" She was giggling, laughing,\r\nalmost jumping up and down with joy. I thought: _She\'s her old self\r\nagain, cheerful, bubbling over ..._\r\n\r\nGeorge said, "I finally realized what she needed more than anything\r\nelse ..."\r\n\r\nHe raised Helen\'s soft brown hair and opened a small panel in the back\r\nof her head. In the recess was a maze of tubes and electrical wiring.\r\n\r\n"She needed a new head," George said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ August 1958.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.
