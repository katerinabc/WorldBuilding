That had been done and men had\r\n         reached the Moon. But strangely, they never returned!\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Imagination Stories of Science and Fantasy\r\n                             November 1951\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThey took a thousand days to build the great, gleaming monster, and\r\nanother two hundred to groom it for its trip around the moon. All this\r\nthey did with an air that made a trip to the moon seem quite natural\r\nand sure, even though three other rockets had gone before and not one\r\nhad returned.\r\n\r\n"This one will," they said, as though convincing themselves.\r\n\r\nBut they were not sure. They were stubborn, perhaps proud, but not sure\r\nat all. All the world had watched three other such rockets, with men\r\nin them, go screaming off moonward. All had waited for them to return.\r\nAnd all had seen nothing come back down from the sky. Not even a small\r\nscrap of metal. This one _might_ return, and, if it did, the men in it\r\njust _might_ be alive to tell. But that was not being sure.\r\n\r\n"A military base on the moon!" the leaders had cried. And that had been\r\nthat. Robot rockets had gone first. They had landed on the moon. They\r\ncould do that, but they could not establish the desired base. So men\r\nhad started on a round trip, around the moon, first to prove that men\r\ncould do it. The only thing they proved was that whatever goes up need\r\nnot come down.\r\n\r\nNow the fourth rocket waited, leaning over against its heavy launching\r\nrack, ready to face whatever unknown danger lay out there beyond.\r\n\r\nOn a certain night, a night long appointed, one overshadowed with\r\nheavy clouds that brought a threat of rain, there were lights about the\r\nrocket and in the low, concrete buildings that cowered back a ways from\r\nthe upright metal giant. Around the base of the rocket men scurried\r\nlike ants, making last minute preparations and seeing that everything\r\nwas just so and not being satisfied with "good enough".\r\n\r\nIn one building, a little nearer the rocket than the others, two men\r\nlounged, talking of the coming trip and other things that concerned\r\nlast night\'s women, and smoking endlessly, the last smokes they would\r\nhave for four days. These men would soon climb into a long, metal thing\r\nand try to do what others had failed to do.\r\n\r\nIn other buildings were men with great ideas held firmly in their\r\nminds, doing things with pencils and paper and adding machines. These\r\nchecked back over figures and charts, knowing all the time that\r\neverything was flawless, but checking just the same. Some were Army men\r\nand some were not.\r\n\r\nThe feeling that seemed to grow over everything was one of waiting and\r\nsuspense, and one might know without asking, without seeing the many\r\nglances at watches and clocks, that it would soon be time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nStrangely, the two men waiting and speaking mostly of wine, women and\r\ngeneral good times, knew very little of the import of what they were\r\nabout to do. In fact, they had no real concept of even the size of the\r\nearth, let alone the magnitude of space, the moon and the stars. This,\r\nhowever, was as intended.\r\n\r\nThe men who had gone in the other rockets had been scientists, greatly\r\nskilled men, men of high I.Q.\'s. So the brass and the brains had gotten\r\ntogether and reasoned, and pooled data, and considered statistics,\r\nand finally decided that the strain of being completely out of one\'s\r\nnatural element, exposed to the terrible, thought-twisting blankness of\r\nspace, might be greater than had been supposed. And the high-strung,\r\nsensitive, sometimes slightly neurotic minds of the highly intelligent\r\nmight well be expected to crack under the strain.\r\n\r\nThis, of course, was at most a poor explanation. But it served, at\r\nleast, as an excuse for retaining the great minds and sending those\r\nmore expendable. These, not knowing, would probably consider the whole\r\nthing nothing more than a slightly unusual adventure.\r\n\r\nSo when the Army officers came, very stiff and orderly, and opened the\r\ndoor to the little building, the two men came out laughing and pushing\r\nat one another playfully. They followed the little group of officers\r\ntoward the gleaming rocket, not at all worried, like men going off for\r\na happy spree at some local bar.\r\n\r\nThe rocket seemed to loom higher as they neared it. It was now bathed\r\nin the light of many spotlights, reflecting back the light in such a\r\nway that one might think he would go blind if he looked too long. Only\r\nwhen they stepped on to a platform, with two of the higher officers,\r\nand were lifted swiftly upward, did they give a thought to what was\r\ngoing on.\r\n\r\nThe platform halted its climb just below a round hole near the nose of\r\nthe rocket.\r\n\r\n"You men should know exactly what you are to do," said the higher\r\nofficer, "and that is not much. You are not, under any circumstances,\r\nto touch anything until you near the moon. Up to that time, the rocket\r\nwill be guided by at least one control station here on Earth." The\r\nofficer paused and tried to see understanding in the eyes of the two.\r\nHe was one of those who did not agree with sending such dense fellows.\r\n\r\n"You have been trained for months," he continued, "to read a few\r\ninstruments and to perform the fairly simple tasks required to take you\r\naround the moon and start you back. Do only what you have been taught.\r\nDo nothing more. You must remember that certain conditions near the\r\nmoon, which interfere with radio reception, and which we have been\r\nunable to overcome, will put you entirely on your own until you start\r\nback."\r\n\r\nOne of the men, a little uncertain, acted as if he wished to speak.\r\n\r\n"Yes?" said the officer.\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t they send rockets once without no men in \'em at all?" he\r\nasked. "Then, how come they can\'t do like we wasn\'t even there?"\r\n\r\n"My dear fellow," said the officer, perplexed, "to aim and fire a\r\nrocket at so near and so large a target as the moon is a simple matter.\r\nTo guide one around the moon in a precise orbit is a matter entirely\r\ndifferent." He paused. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
"Any more questions?"\r\n\r\n"No sir," said the men.\r\n\r\n"Very good." The officer seemed glad there would be no further\r\nconversation. "In you go now."\r\n\r\nThe men went into the opening, helped by the officers, like olives\r\nbeing put into a bottle. In a moment the officers had gone and a cover\r\nhad been placed into the opening and screwed firmly into place.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was lead-glass, very heavy, in the windows of all the buildings.\r\nThe thick cement walls and doors were covered with sheets of lead.\r\n\r\nInside the most distant buildings, at the small windows, men stood\r\nwith black looking glasses over their eyes, watching. Each time a\r\nrocket went into space it was exactly thus. The atomic drive was new\r\nand not completely perfect. Always there was a chance that something\r\nmight go wrong. The radiation grids could go haywire, there could be an\r\nexplosion, or the ship could falter and slip on the way up.\r\n\r\nSo the men waited and watched in their little buildings, with fingers\r\ncrossed, hoping for the best.\r\n\r\nNow it was very quiet. The spotlights had been extinguished because\r\nevery bit of electric power was needed to start the amazing rocket\r\nmotor. Only enough was spared for lighting, where needed, in the\r\nbuildings, and for the P.A. system. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
And over the P.A. system voices\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n"Trackers ready?"\r\n\r\n"Trackers ready."\r\n\r\n"Control station ready?"\r\n\r\n"Control station ready."\r\n\r\n"Radio room, report!"\r\n\r\n"Radio reporting. All tracking and control stations reported or relayed\r\nin."\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. Then: "Stand by." The silence seemed to grow even\r\nmore intense. The ticking of clocks and watches could be heard. The\r\nunreal atmosphere of a dream settled over the clustered buildings on\r\nthe plain.\r\n\r\n"Activators!"\r\n\r\nOut on the plain, the rocket came to life. It surged and clattered\r\nagainst its launching rack, nearly leaping, pawing the ground with hot\r\nexplosive blasts. Now it became a living wild thing, a bound monster\r\nsurging against its chains, fighting to be free and away.\r\n\r\nThe voice, in a short while, came again, a little strained. "Ready....\r\nReady.... Ready.... ROCKET AWAY!"\r\n\r\nThe great, gleaming monster lifted up from the plain, bellowing its\r\ndefiance of space with the voice of ten thousand waterfalls. It rode\r\nup from the center of a tremendous flower of glowing dust on a pillar\r\nof intense blue flame, slowly gathering speed, like a whale rushing up\r\nfrom the depths of the ocean.\r\n\r\nFor a while it lighted up miles of rolling plain with its glare, and\r\nsent its thunder out to crash against distant hills. Then it was gone\r\nbeyond heavy clouds, leaving only a smear of light above and a hollow,\r\nboiling rumble, muted by distance.\r\n\r\nIn the thin, cold air above the clouds the rocket pointed its sharp\r\nnose eastward. It raced across the sky, a blue streaking and a\r\nstuttering scream. It crossed a nation with amazing speed and moved\r\nover the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nIn an instant the moon and the stars were gone and the rocket was\r\nlooking at the sun. Clear morning fled away in fear of this flaming\r\nbeast and it was noon within minutes after sunrise. In an hour the\r\nnight returned, the stars and the moon with it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Brother, we\'re in!" cried Pfc. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Walter Jones, in the head of the\r\nrocket. "Boy, the babes\'ll mob us after this. Real big shots, that\'s\r\nus. The men in the moon! Hah!"\r\n\r\n"If we get back," Pvt. Robert Moore shouted over the roar. "Remember,\r\nwe gotta get back yet."\r\n\r\n"Chicken!" shouted Jones. "Chicken\'s what you are!"\r\n\r\n"Oh yeah? So what happens to them guys what went before?"\r\n\r\n"Nuts to that," Jones sneered. "I hear they\'s a lot of places up in\r\nspace we don\'t know nothin\' about, where there\'s maybe a lot of nice\r\nbabes and buildings made out of gold and stuff like that."\r\n\r\n"Scientists don\'t go much for babes," Moore said.\r\n\r\nJones kicked back in his seat, roaring laughter. "Hah! 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Don\'t kid\r\nyourself, son. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Anyway, so what? So they get a chance to be kings, or\r\nsomethin\', on account of being from Earth. What do they do? They stay\r\nan\' be kings, natch\'!"\r\n\r\n"It ain\'t for me," said Moore, moodily. "I know babes on good ol\'\r\nEarth. An\' who wants to be king?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I\'m tellin\' you," Jones shouted. "We ain\'t got no worry at\r\nall. All we gotta do is not let them guys up there sidetrack us."\r\n\r\n"I hope you\'re right," said Moore.\r\n\r\nThey fell silent, looking down at the reeling Earth. On the ground,\r\ntwo hundred miles below, at every tracking and control station around\r\nthe world, men worked without pause, trying to make their tired minds\r\noutrace a speeding rocket. Night side and day side, messages flashed\r\nthrough the ether. They reported in: position, time, corrections made,\r\npassing the rocket quickly, from one to another like a hot potato.\r\n\r\nOn its last lap around the world before flinging itself moonward, the\r\nrocket screamed across the much worn boot of Italy. It climbed swiftly\r\nup the sky of the Holy Land and plunged down in the east, drawing a\r\nblue pencil line across the heavens that faded slowly.\r\n\r\nAt last it turned upward, and breathing streamers of fire and light,\r\nshot into airless space, a silver arrow gone from the bow and dead on\r\nits mark.\r\n\r\n"It sure seems quiet," said Moore.\r\n\r\nThey looked through the glassite port into the great distances.\r\n\r\n"Quiet, and empty."\r\n\r\n"Yeah!"\r\n\r\n"Do you feel different?" 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Jones asked suddenly.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. Maybe. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
In a way."\r\n\r\n"Like you can think a lot better?"\r\n\r\n"Something like that," Moore said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey sat and thought about it. The rocket was now fifteen hundred miles\r\nup, climbing swiftly.\r\n\r\n"For one thing," Moore said, "we are lighter. What do they call it?\r\nGravity? Gravity is less."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like it," cried Jones. "I don\'t like it at all!"\r\n\r\n"What?" Moore looked at him.\r\n\r\nJones stared back, frightened. "It\'s nothing like I thought it would\r\nbe. Maybe we\'ll get so light there won\'t be anything left! Where is\r\neverything? It\'s so empty it don\'t make sense. Something\'s wrong, Bob.\r\nLet\'s try to turn back before we die like the others! 

=== Chunk 9 ===
I don\'t want to\r\ndie! I want--"\r\n\r\nMoore reached over and slapped the other\'s face, hard. Jones focused\r\nglassy, unsteady eyes, surprised and hurt. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
"Why did you do that?"\r\n\r\n"You called me yellow a while ago," Moore said, disgusted. "Now it\'s\r\nyou who are acting like a woman or a child. You would really kill us,\r\ntrying to turn back at this velocity."\r\n\r\n"I\'m still afraid," Jones said, but not wildly. "I don\'t know what\'s\r\nhappening to me. I can remember things that happened years ago; things\r\nI hardly noticed. I\'m starting to understand things I never understood\r\nbefore, and some of the things are hard to take."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think I feel it, too?" Moore looked out at space in a new\r\nway, understanding.\r\n\r\nFor a while there was silence, a little strained, while the rocket sped\r\nanother thousand miles. After that it was not so strained. It was more\r\nan atmosphere of concentration, of two men, thinking within themselves.\r\nThere was no more fear.\r\n\r\n"So this is what happened to the others," Moore said finally. "But what\r\ndo we have to fear?"\r\n\r\nJones shrugged. "I\'m not afraid anymore, but maybe I should be." He\r\nleaned back and looked at Moore. "Have you any idea what is happening\r\nto us?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not sure," Moore frowned.\r\n\r\n"It\'s as if some great obstacle to clear thinking has been removed.\r\nHave you noticed how we have been speaking? Our memory has so improved\r\nthat we are able to use words we may have seen or heard used only a few\r\ntimes. And the new sharpness of mind that enables us to use these words\r\nproperly also makes us able to grasp quickly new ideas and to reason\r\nlogically. As to what causes the change, I do not know."\r\n\r\n"I have been thinking about gravity," said Jones, reflecting. "It\r\nseems to me that the change in mental power is just about inversely\r\nproportioned to change in gravity. That might, in some way, have\r\nsomething to do with it.

=== Chunk 11 ===
"\r\n\r\nMoore sighed, frowning. "You may be right. But, granting that you are,\r\nwe are still in the dark as to the nature of the danger we must face."\r\n\r\n"I think I\'m beginning to get some idea," said Jones. "I wouldn\'t be\r\nsurprised if my first crude idea, in a way, was very nearly right."\r\n\r\nMoore showed surprise. "You still think those others found someone out\r\nhere who made them kings, or some such?" He laughed.\r\n\r\n"Not exactly," Jones said. "But there may be even stranger things." And\r\nhe would say no more.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt fifty thousand miles they had lost all thought of danger. They spoke\r\nof space and the unseen medium that must be there. After forming\r\nthe only logical conclusion about the nature of this, they passed on\r\nto matters of relativity and the nature of time and of life itself,\r\nunderstanding each in its turn.\r\n\r\nThey became so absorbed in conversation they did not even notice when\r\nthey stopped talking and conversed in pure thought. Not even did they\r\nrealize that a golden glow had come to their faces and bodies that was\r\nnot simple light. And they were content in knowing they would never\r\nreturn to earth, knowing also that they would not die.\r\n\r\nThe rocket carried them one hundred thousand miles through space before\r\nit happened.\r\n\r\n"There is someone behind us," Jones said, simply.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: As he looked through the glassite hull of the space\r\nship at the surface of the Moon a strange thing happened. A shimmering\r\nfigure appeared in a halo of light.]\r\n\r\nThey looked, and beheld a man standing in space. He was hardly a man\r\nanymore, as men are called, but one like themselves. A golden glow\r\nseemed to blend with him. He smiled.\r\n\r\n"Welcome!"\r\n\r\n"We have been expecting you," said Moore, smiling in return. "Your\r\nvoice, your thoughts reached us. We know you are one of those who came\r\nout in a rocket before us. But your name is not clear.

=== Chunk 12 ===
"\r\n\r\nThe being seemed mildly surprised. Then he laughed; a thing that was\r\nas the tinkle of small bells, as the dew of a cool meadow before the\r\nrising sun or the joyous song of a nightingale.\r\n\r\n"I am one of them," he said, "and all of them. We who have overcome\r\nthe chains of gravity, who have become one in thought and find it\r\nimpossible to do otherwise, have no need for individuality."\r\n\r\n"But you have a body," said Jones. "Surely that gives you some sort of\r\nindividuality."\r\n\r\n"Yes, if one\'s mind is bound, controlled by matter. But the mind\r\nworking without resistance is a perfect machine. It is able to control\r\nmatter in every respect. We take this form or that form as a matter of\r\nexpedience."\r\n\r\n"We have reasoned that all this is due to release from gravity," Moore\r\nreflected. "But we do not understand completely. Will you tell us?"\r\n\r\n"Even those on Earth know that gravity hampers the mind," the being\r\nsaid. "This they have learned through observation of mental factors in\r\nrelation to the gravitational pull of the sun and moon. But look into\r\nmy mind and you will see more clearly."\r\n\r\nThey looked, and saw a copper disk turn before a powerful magnet. And\r\nthey saw resistance caused by electric currents induced in the copper,\r\nso that a great deal of power was required to turn the disk, even\r\nslowly. This, the thoughts indicated, was a principal well known to\r\nthose yet on Earth.\r\n\r\nNext came the relationship between magnetism and gravity, clearly\r\ndemonstrated.\r\n\r\nThey then saw a human brain, locked in the powerful embrace of\r\ngravity. And the tiny pulsations and complex motions, the processes\r\nof thought, were, as with the disk, sluggish--in large portions not\r\neven present. They watched a brain come alive as gravity decreased. It\r\nbulged, the tempo of motion rising, parts long dormant surging with\r\npower. They saw and they understood.\r\n\r\n"If only we could go back and help them," sighed Jones. "If we could\r\novercome that gravity on Earth!"\r\n\r\nAgain the being smiled his kind smile. "If you returned it would be to\r\nthe same mental prison. You could not, in your crude manner, convince\r\nthem."\r\n\r\nThe two knew what they must do, even before the being spoke again.\r\n\r\n"The others, the rest, wait beyond the light of universes," he said.\r\n"We think. We learn. Soon, we will find a way of helping those on\r\nEarth, and we will return. Come with me."\r\n\r\nThey replied together. "We are ready."\r\n\r\nOn the dark side of the moon, where they had been projected by\r\nidentical velocities, lay the battered wrecks of four gleaming rockets.\r\nAnd in all the wreckage, among all the bits of twisted metal, there was\r\nnot a single drop of human blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
