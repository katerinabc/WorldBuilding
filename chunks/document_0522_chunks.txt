He had been in the Fourth Quadrant of Fless territory,\r\nthreading an uneasy course through the extraterrestrials\' home grounds,\r\nbut he hadn\'t expected to be caught so suddenly or so hard.\r\n\r\nThe ship stopped in mid-flight abruptly--so abruptly that Marten\'s head\r\nwas slammed back against the rear of the seat, and for a moment he was\r\nparalyzed by the shock of what had happened.\r\n\r\nBut only for a moment. His toe reached out, snapped the pedal on the\r\nsubspace radio, and an instant later the voice of Earth Central\'s\r\noperator said, "What is it, Marten?"\r\n\r\n"Tell them I\'ve been caught," Marten said crisply. "Tell \'em the\r\nFlesso patrols got me. And--"\r\n\r\nThe radio went dead as the Flesso dampers got to it. Marten pulled\r\nhimself forward and ran his eyes over the instrument panel. Against the\r\ndark velvet of space, a dull-gray Flesso warship was swelling in the\r\nviewplate, preparing to scoop up its prey. Marten had been caught like\r\na fly in molasses.\r\n\r\nThe odds had been against his stunt anyway. Theoretically, such a\r\nsmall ship as the little scout he was piloting should have been able\r\nto get through the Flesso patrols easily--but in practice, the network\r\nof spybeams stretching through the entire Quadrant were efficient and\r\nnear-infallible defenses, as Marten was discovering now.\r\n\r\n_But I had lousy luck too_, he thought. _I wandered right up to the\r\nbiggest warship in the whole damned fleet. Must have come within a\r\nlight week or less._\r\n\r\nThere wasn\'t much point in trying to break away, now. Marten was\r\ntrapped--thoroughly and unarguably. The little scout ship didn\'t carry\r\na tenth the power he would need to break from the grasp of the big\r\nbattle cruiser. And as for the scout ship\'s armament, it wasn\'t enough\r\neven to tickle the screens of a battleship like this one. Scout ships\r\ndepended on speed and indetectability, and neither attribute was of\r\nmuch value now.\r\n\r\nWithin minutes, the heavy tractor beams pulled the smaller ship into\r\nthe yawning airlock of the huge Flesso cruiser.\r\n\r\n_Okay_, Marten thought. He folded his arms, leaned back in his chair,\r\nand waited. There was nothing else he could do--until a Fless tried to\r\nenter the ship.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTime passed. The little scout ship was drawn further and further into\r\nthe monster Flesso ship. It was now entirely enclosed by darkness,\r\nimprisoned within the metal hull of the huge battleship of space.\r\n\r\nSitting inside, Marten waited patiently. The Flesso had been wanting to\r\ncapture an Earthman for a long time. Well, now they\'d succeeded. They\'d\r\ncaptured their first Earth ship.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, Marten\'s damped communicator screen came back to life. A\r\nscaly, toad-like face appeared, and Marten stared blandly at the three\r\nred-rimmed, fiery eyes that confronted him.\r\n\r\n"I see you are still alive, Earthman!"\r\n\r\n"No thanks to you, ugly-face!" Marten returned. "I\'m hungry, though. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Am\r\nI going to stay for dinner, or can I leave now?"\r\n\r\nEarth and Fless had long been in communication with each other; the\r\nwar had lasted for nearly five years, ever since the first treacherous\r\nFlesso sneak attack on a Terran outpost. The beings from the planet\r\nFless were the coldest, most dangerous aliens Earth had yet encountered\r\nin its expansion to the stars.\r\n\r\nDuring the war, neither side had succeeded in capturing one of the\r\nother\'s men alive. The ravening energies of a billion-cycle space gun\r\ntore a ship completely apart, leaving no survivors. But now Marten had\r\nbeen captured--and he was determined to make the most of it.\r\n\r\n"Keep your tongue!" the toad-faced Fless snarled. "Do you know who I\r\nam?"\r\n\r\n"Santa Claus? Uncle Sam? 

=== Chunk 4 ===
The Wicked Witch of the North?"\r\n\r\nThe alien\'s face radiated hatred. "I am Ghuvekenkh-Nathor!"\r\n\r\nMarten whistled. Ghuvek, eh? He had really stumbled into a good one,\r\nthen. Ghuvek was the leader of the Flesso legions!\r\n\r\n"Hello, Ghuvek. The pleasure is all mine. Do I _have_ to keep looking\r\nat your face?"\r\n\r\n"You will surrender or die," Ghuvek said, ignoring the barb.\r\n\r\nMarten chuckled. "Okay. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Come and get me, ugly!" He reached out and\r\nsnapped off the communicator decisively.\r\n\r\nWithout waiting to see what would happen next, he sprang from the\r\ncontrol seat. The Flesso were going to expect to find him inside the\r\nlittle scout ship. Very well, Marten thought. That\'s the one place I\r\n_won\'t_ be.\r\n\r\nSmiling grimly, he strapped on a pair of bulky Spaulding\r\ncutter-pistols, and headed for the escape hatch. The aliens, he knew,\r\nwould be watching the main airlock--they wouldn\'t be expecting a second\r\nexit, and, if they were, they wouldn\'t know exactly where it would be.\r\n\r\nSilently, Marten dropped through the hatch at the rear of the ship.\r\n_Come and get me_, he thought. _I\'m ready._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe found himself in a large metal room that measured well over\r\na hundred feet in width and twice that in length. The ceiling,\r\ndimly-seen, was far overhead, beyond any quick estimation.\r\n\r\nCrouching in the shadow of his ship, Marten watched a platoon of the\r\nloathsome Flesso bring a heavy, semi-portable burner up to the airlock.\r\nThe reptilian aliens were having quite a time with the weapon; there\r\nwas much hissing and flicking of tails as they got it in position.\r\n\r\nFinally, they managed to train the muzzle on the door, and then pressed\r\nthe firing studs. A dazzling blue-white glare leaped toward the airlock\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n_Lovely_, Marten thought, as the bright light cast fierce illumination\r\nin the giant room. An instant after the burner went into action, so did\r\nMarten. He drew his Spauldings and fired.\r\n\r\nOne--two--three--four--\r\n\r\nFour quick, silent spurts of flame, and four of the aliens lay dead,\r\ncharred through by the noiseless, almost invisible energy of the\r\nSpauldings. The unfortunate aliens had had no way of knowing where it\r\nhad come from, that death that had hit four of their number in as many\r\nseconds. The burst of light from the semi-portable burner had blanketed\r\nevery trace of the faint radiation from Marten\'s pistols.\r\n\r\nHuddling low, Marten ran for a nearby girder, taking advantage of the\r\nfact that the aliens\' attentions were still directed toward the airlock\r\nof his ship. Naturally, they wouldn\'t notice a figure running from the\r\nrear.\r\n\r\nHe took a position behind the girder and, aiming carefully, picked off\r\nfour more of the aliens. He tried to put his shot just back of the\r\noversized, toad-like heads of the Flesso, though it didn\'t matter much\r\nwhere the beam landed. The result was the same.\r\n\r\nThe survivors were conferring hissingly and evincing great confusion.\r\nApparently they still thought the fire was coming from somewhere within\r\nthe ship, but they were unable to figure out where.\r\n\r\nThere were eight of them left. Marten picked off one of them with\r\nhis ninth charge, then held fire. He had one charge left, and then\r\nthere would be a thirty-second delay while the Spaulding\'s recharged\r\nthemselves. He didn\'t want to leave himself defenseless even for\r\nthirty seconds.\r\n\r\nHe counted off. Ten, fifteen, twenty--one gun was charged. He raised\r\nit, readied to fire, when he heard a sudden tell-tale hiss from behind\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe whirled, but it was too late. A searing beam of energy cracked into\r\nhim, hurling him backward. He clung to consciousness an instant, then\r\nblacked out as the beam shorted his neural circuits.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke, Marten opened his eyes, blinked, closed them again.\r\n\r\n"Ugh," he said.\r\n\r\nHe felt a savage poke in the stomach. "_Open your eyes!_"\r\n\r\n"Do I have to?"\r\n\r\n"_Open them!_"\r\n\r\nWith visible reluctance, he opened his lids and stared into the\r\nbulging, lidless eyes of none other than Ghuvekenkh-Nathor himself.\r\n\r\nThe Flesso leader was even uglier than usual. "Very clever, Earthman,"\r\nhe said coldly. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
"For that little trick, you\'ll die--slowly. After we\r\nhave extracted all the information we need from you, that is."\r\n\r\n"Trick?" asked Marten blankly.\r\n\r\n"Yes. Getting out of the ship and shooting down my men."\r\n\r\n"Dear me," Marten said innocently. "I thought that was the smart thing\r\nto do, in view of your hostile attitude. I didn\'t realize you\'d be so\r\nstuffy about it, but I\'m sorry that you\'re so stupid you--"\r\n\r\n"_Silence!_"\r\n\r\nA heavy, clawed hand smashed across his face, slamming his head to one\r\nside. The enraged alien leader turned to a henchman at his side. "Get\r\nthe brainprobe, Captain Yknor."\r\n\r\n"At once, Commander."\r\n\r\nThe captain waddled over to an elaborate-looking machine near the wall,\r\nand removed its translucent hood. Marten looked at it, and almost\r\ngasped. The thing was so much like the Terran model of a brainprobe\r\nthat only a practiced eye could tell them apart.\r\n\r\nObviously, this machine worked on the same principle as the Earth-type\r\nbrainprobe did. And that, Marten reflected, was not a pleasant thought.\r\n\r\n"You use that for picking your teeth, Ghuvek?"\r\n\r\n"You\'ll find out its use soon enough, Earthman." The Flesso scowled and\r\nsignalled to the captain to wheel the brainprobe over.\r\n\r\nNo organic brain, Marten knew, could stand up against the mental\r\nenergies of a brainprobe. Within seconds, it could render any person a\r\nslave to the will of whoever operated the machine. Marten clenched his\r\njaws grimly, ready to resist anything the Flesso could throw against\r\nhim. There was always a chance that--\r\n\r\n"Your mouth will be less full of insults when we have finished with\r\nyou, Earthman."\r\n\r\n"You\'re scaring me, Ghuvek."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll see. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Clamp down the helmet."\r\n\r\nThe cold metal descended and the Captain anchored it tightly around\r\nMarten\'s skull.\r\n\r\n"What shall I ask first, Most Noble Sire?" Captain Yknor asked.\r\n\r\nGhuvekenkh-Nathor smiled harshly. "I am interested in knowing how it\r\nwas that he deflected the death-dealing beam that shot him down. It\r\nshould have killed him--but it merely knocked him out. Ask the prisoner\r\nwhat protection he has."\r\n\r\nYknor threw a switch, and a low buzzing hum throbbed in the room as the\r\nbrainprobe\'s generators went to work. Marten felt a faint tingling in\r\nhis skull. Then Yknor turned a dial, and the probe sank into his brain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe held his breath as the energy projectors of the brainprobe wandered\r\naround in his skull, seeking to gain hold. They failed. The Flesso\r\nmodel wasn\'t attuned to Earth minds, apparently.\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t the energy beam kill you?" Captain Yknor asked.\r\n\r\n"Because it missed me," said Marten calmly.\r\n\r\nA grin spread across Ghuvek\'s evil, toadish face.\r\n\r\n"Good!" he said exultantly. "It missed him--but now we know that the\r\nEarthmen have no defense against our weapons." He rubbed his dry, scaly\r\nhands together.\r\n\r\n"The next question, Sire?"\r\n\r\n"Make him tell us about the defenses of Earth," Ghuvek said.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be damned if I will, you bloated monstrosity."\r\n\r\nGhuvek\'s globular eyes blinked slowly in surprise. "But--you\'re\r\nsupposed to be under the power of the machine!" He turned his flat,\r\nbatrachian head to glare at Captain Yknor. "Turn up the power!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Sire."\r\n\r\nYknor\'s thick claws wrenched up the dial and a surge of power thundered\r\nthrough Marten\'s brain without leaving an impression.\r\n\r\n"Feels nice," he said. "Like an extra-special shampoo. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
But you wouldn\'t\r\nknow what a shampoo is, would you?"\r\n\r\n"Up higher!" 

=== Chunk 9 ===
Ghuvek snapped.\r\n\r\n"That\'s as high as it goes, Sire."\r\n\r\nMarten still sat there, sneering openly at the alien\'s attempts to read\r\nhis brain. Ghuvek paced angrily around the seated Earthman without\r\nspeaking.\r\n\r\n"All right," he said finally. "Shut the machine off. Obviously, the\r\nEarthman\'s brain just does not respond." There was anger and more than\r\na touch of surprise in his voice. "Take the brainprobe away."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Sire."\r\n\r\nGhuvek\'s eyes grew hard. "There are, however, older and cruder ways.\r\nWhat do you say to torture, eh, Earthman?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not much in favor of it," said Marten. "I can\'t say I care for the\r\nidea at all."\r\n\r\n"Good," Ghuvek said. "Yknor, prepare the torture!"\r\n\r\nNo human being likes physical torture. The idea of having hot needles\r\nslid under one\'s fingernails, of having one\'s toenails removed by\r\npincers, of being scourged with nerve-whips--none of these were\r\npleasant thoughts.\r\n\r\nNot pleasant, perhaps, but not unbearable, so far as Marten was\r\nconcerned. It hurt; of course it hurt. But not once during the terrible\r\nordeal did Marten either pass out or give any sign that the torture was\r\nmore than he could bear.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter, Ghuvek? Slowing down?"\r\n\r\nAt each taunt, the alien overlord grew uglier and angrier. And as the\r\nhorror went on, Ghuvek seemed to come more and more frantic. None of\r\nthe most delicate subtle torture devised--and the Flesso were experts\r\nat devising torture--seemed to have any effect on the Earthman. He\r\nsimply sat there, grimly, stoically.\r\n\r\n"You\'re boring me, Ghuvek," Marten remarked as an acid-tipped auger\r\nnibbled flesh from his chest. "But I\'m willing to be cooperative.\r\nYou\'ll notice I\'m just sitting here patiently while you play with me."\r\n\r\n"Very well!" Ghuvek stormed. "If that\'s your attitude, we\'ll see what\r\ncan be done! Perhaps you Earthmen have no pain nerves--but at the sight\r\nof your very bodies being destroyed--"\r\n\r\n"I think I\'ve had about enough of this," Marten said. Flexing his\r\nmuscles, he yanked one hand free of the torture-chair and ripped the\r\nauger from his chest.\r\n\r\nHe hurled the acid-tipped drill far across the room, where it smashed\r\nagainst the wall. Then he pulled his other arm free and, with one final\r\nstraining effort, rose from the chair and stood unbound.\r\n\r\n"_What?_" Ghuvek\'s half-whispered question was almost impossible to\r\nhear. "You\'re _free_?" Captain Yknor opened his bulging eyes even wider\r\nand flattened himself against the wall, while Ghuvek gasped in terror.\r\n\r\n"I\'m free," Marten said. "I got tired of having you play with me."\r\n\r\nHe smiled cheerfully--and then sprang into life as one of the\r\nprojectors that lined the wall, manned by guards outside, moved just\r\na fraction of an inch. A burst of energy from one of those projectors\r\ncould kill him--but it would kill anyone or anything else.\r\n\r\nHe leaped on Ghuvek. He sensed the acrid, nauseating odor of the alien,\r\nand wrapped his legs around the Flesso\'s body, pitching them both to\r\nthe ground. The two of them rolled over against the far wall.\r\n\r\nA quick glance told Marten that the projectors in the walls were\r\nfollowing, but they couldn\'t shoot for fear of hitting Ghuvek.\r\n\r\nThe Flesso leader squirmed in Marten\'s grip as he tried to get his ray\r\npistol out of its holster.\r\n\r\n"No you don\'t!" Marten said, and grabbed the alien\'s arm. Ghuvek\r\ngrunted as Marten bent the arm upward and twisted until the ligaments\r\ncreaked.\r\n\r\n"No!" Ghuvek moaned.\r\n\r\n"Drop the gun, then."\r\n\r\nThe alien squirmed again. Marten twisted upward and there was a sharp\r\n_crack_--followed by another, the sound of the gun hitting the floor.\r\nThen something slammed against Marten\'s head from behind.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJerking his head aside, he crashed his fist against Ghuvek\'s temple to\r\nknock him out and reduce the opposition. Again something struck his\r\nhead. This time, Marten turned and grabbed a slimy wrist.\r\n\r\nIt was Captain Yknor, who had been trying to knock Marten out with the\r\nbutt of his pistol. Marten twisted viciously at the captain\'s wrist,\r\nand the ray pistol clattered to the floor. Yknor screamed in agony as a\r\nburning pain raced up his arm, and swung wildly at Marten with his good\r\narm.\r\n\r\nThe savage claws raked the air just above the Earthman\'s head, and he\r\ndrove in with a solid punch that made Yknor gasp. Marten followed his\r\nadvantage with a smash to the face, sent the alien reeling away in\r\npain, and in the same motion reached down and grasped one of the fallen\r\nray-pistols.\r\n\r\nHe stepped over to Ghuvek\'s limp body and jabbed the pistol into the\r\nalien leader\'s scaly side.\r\n\r\n"All right," he said coldly. "Anything more, and I\'ll let\r\nGhuvekenkh-Nathor have a fast burn through his guts!"\r\n\r\nThere was a stunned silence for a moment, then the pain-wracked voice\r\nof Captain Yknor said, "Don\'t shoot at the Earthman. Get away from\r\nthose projectors!"\r\n\r\nThe projector crew held fire. Marten waited tensely as Ghuvek moaned\r\nand stirred. Ten feet away, standing amidst the torture implements, the\r\ncaptain clutched his broken arm and watched the Earthman with terror\r\nin his eyes and pain evident on his face.\r\n\r\nGhuvek blinked his eyes opened. He looked dazed for a moment, then\r\nfocussed his eyes on Marten. His right arm, the Earthman noticed, was\r\ntwisted horribly.\r\n\r\n"Yknor?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s over there," Marten said. "His arm didn\'t bend either. And if you\r\nmove, I\'ll find out how resistant your innards are to a quick burn."\r\n\r\nGhuvek shook his head bewilderedly. "You\'ve got us, Earthman. But--how\r\ndid it happen? How could one man take over a great battleship?"\r\n\r\n"It was easy," Marten said.\r\n\r\nGhuvek moaned and looked at his mangled arm regretfully. "I don\'t\r\nunderstand," the defeated alien commander said.\r\n\r\n"Why did you let us torture you if you could get away so easily?"\r\n\r\nMarten smiled. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
"I wanted to teach you a lesson," he said. "Earth\'s been\r\npatient with your marauding for a long time, and we put up with your\r\nsneak attack on Regulus. But the time has come to tell you to stop--or\r\nwe\'ll wipe your whole race out of the Galaxy. We\'re tired of your\r\ntactics, Ghuvek. And if one man can do this to you, what can a whole\r\narmy of us do?"\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence before Ghuvek spoke. And when he spoke, it\r\nwas the voice of a being whose pride had been completely crushed. "If\r\nwe had known," he said weakly, swallowing. "Who knew the Earthmen were\r\nsupermen? You\'re the first we could capture--and it was all a trick!\r\nYou _let_ us capture you, to show us what you could do."\r\n\r\n"Very smart, Ghuvek. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
You learn quickly."\r\n\r\nThe alien passed one hand over his face. "We\'ll ... we\'ll call off our\r\noffensive at once."\r\n\r\n"Good. Now I\'ll use your radio to call Earth and tell them you\'re on\r\nyour way to arrange peace terms!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt Earth Military Headquarters, General James Bedford snapped off the\r\nsubspace radio and grinned at the man who faced him across the table,\r\nColonel Parnell.\r\n\r\n"You hear that, Parnell? The trick worked! He got them so scared of\r\nEarthmen that they\'re ready to come to terms."\r\n\r\nColonel Parnell smiled. 

=== Chunk 12 ===
"Fine deal all around. It cost us ten billion\r\ndollars to build Military Advance Robot Number Ten, not counting what\r\nwe spent on the first nine failures--but it was worth it. We\'ve saved\r\nuntold numbers of lives."\r\n\r\nThe general nodded. "Well worth it. MAR-10 did the job perfectly."\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
