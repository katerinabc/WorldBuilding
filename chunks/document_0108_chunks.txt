Jon woke,\r\nclambered to his feet, and rolled his sleeping-blanket. Within five\r\nminutes, he was fully awake and ready to protect the Tower against its\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nHe took his station and stared out over the sea. Far in the distance,\r\nhe could make out the bomb-blackened city; off to the left was the\r\nspot of green that indicated the village of the Free People. Somewhere\r\nbeyond were the lands of the Wild Ones--the ones Jon was here to defend\r\nthe tower against.\r\n\r\n"All well to the East!" he cried, when his turn came. The other\r\nGuardsmen, stationed in a circle around the Tower, called off their\r\nobservations in turn.\r\n\r\nThe morning passed slowly. A little before noon, the man at the top of\r\nthe Tower cried, "Enemy boat approaching! Prepare to defend the Tower!"\r\n\r\nJon\'s mouth tightened, and he squinted toward the dot of light on the\r\nsea that was the boat of the Wild Ones. Slowly, he drew his sword,\r\nwhisked it through the air a few times, loosened his wrist. It was the\r\nfirst time in over a month that he had been called upon to do battle in\r\nthe name of the Tower.\r\n\r\nFrom within the Tower, the auxiliary guard-force came running out and\r\ntook battle-stations. They stood ready, waiting for the Wild Ones to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNo one knew what the Tower was. It had been there as long as any of the\r\nFree People could remember, and probably had been there forever. It was\r\nsacred to them, and for that reason was under constant attack by their\r\nenemies from the Wild Places.\r\n\r\nAt twenty-three, Jon had been a Tower guard for nearly three years, had\r\ntaken part in almost twenty defenses. The Wild Ones had practically\r\ncaptured the Tower twice, but each time the guardians had driven them\r\noff.\r\n\r\nNow, they were back for another try. Jon waited tensely as they drew\r\nnear.\r\n\r\nTime passed slowly. Five minutes, ten, while the enemy attacking-party\r\napproached. The look-out at the top of the Tower sang out periodically,\r\nkeeping the guards below informed of the boat\'s progress.\r\n\r\nFinally: "They\'re here! Prepare to defend the Tower!"\r\n\r\nThe great sailing-ship pulled up on the shore, and men began to pour\r\nforth--ten, twenty, thirty men. It was a good-sized army. And Jon\r\ngasped when he saw who led them.\r\n\r\nHe was a giant, topping seven feet by several inches. His sword\r\nglittered in the sunlight as he slashed it savagely through the air,\r\nand his hair was a coarse, matted mane. He growled some barbaric\r\ncommand and the Wild Ones charged onward. The ring of defenders\r\ntightened and stood firm, waiting for the attack.\r\n\r\nSwords rang. Jon found himself opposing a brawny youth with fierce,\r\nwidely-set eyes and a good sword-hand. He parried a two-handed chop\r\nthat could have cut him in half, and smashed back with a quick lunge\r\nthat drew blood.\r\n\r\n"Dog!" The Wild One flicked blood from the flesh wound and drove\r\nforward. Jon parried again, drove in, crashed his sword off the\r\nother\'s hilt. His hand numbed, the Wild One dropped his sword. Without\r\nhesitating, Jon cut the unarmed man down and turned to seek his next\r\nopponent.\r\n\r\nHe glanced over and saw Len, the Tower Captain, in tight combat with a\r\ngigantic Wild One. The giant was driving Len back toward the sea with\r\nsweeping swings of his huge broadsword.\r\n\r\nJon turned and started to go to Len\'s assistance when another barbarian\r\ninterposed himself. Jon whirled and leaped forward for the battle, just\r\nas he saw Len fall to the giant\'s sword.\r\n\r\n"Give back! Give back!"

someone yelled.

"They\'re beating us!"\r\n\r\n_They\'re not beating me_, Jon thought fiercely, as he laid open his\r\nopponent\'s arm with a savage slash and followed immediately with a\r\nquick swipe that ripped open the Wild One\'s throat.\r\n\r\nBreathing hard, now, Jon turned to look for his next opponent. He had\r\nbut one thought: the Tower must be defended. The Tower was sacred to\r\nthe Free People; the Tower must be defended.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe found himself embroiled in another duel quickly enough. The\r\nbarbarians seemed to be all over the place, cutting and slashing with\r\ntheir wild, untrained manner. A quick glance around told Jon that the\r\nTower guards were being driven back; half a dozen of his childhood\r\nfriends lay slain near him, and a river of blood trickled slowly\r\nthrough the grass.\r\n\r\nThe barbarians were falling too--but their giant leader was\r\nindomitable, was wreaking death right and left in the ranks of the\r\nGuardians.\r\n\r\nJon killed his opponent and looked around. The thick of the battle was\r\non the other side of the Tower, he saw. It was now nearly noon, and the\r\nsun blazed brightly off the Tower\'s metal sides.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached the other side of the Tower, he was surprised to see\r\nthat barely half a dozen guards remained alive. Half a dozen, out of\r\nnearly forty.\r\n\r\nHe plunged into the fray with furious energy, cutting down three\r\nWild Ones before they realized he was there. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
That narrowed the odds\r\nconsiderably.\r\n\r\nOnly three of the Free People remained--and four of the Wild Ones. It\r\nhad been a bloody, fierce battle, with heavy loss of life on both sides.\r\n\r\nJon\'s sword plunged into a barbarian\'s throat, and in that instant the\r\ngiant\'s weapon cut the life from the man at Jon\'s side. Two against\r\nthree, now.\r\n\r\n"Now!" Jon yelled and drove down against one of the remaining Wild\r\nOnes. His slash ripped open the man\'s leg, but before Jon could apply\r\nthe finishing touch one of the other barbarians killed his man and\r\nlunged at Jon, who parried and dropped the man with a swift chop.\r\n\r\nThe realization hit him suddenly: _I\'m all alone._\r\n\r\nAnd the gigantic Wild One was moving slowly toward him to finish off\r\nthe last of the Tower guards.\r\n\r\nJon set his lips grimly. So the Tower would fall, after all, to the\r\nbarbarians? _Not lightly_, he thought, and waited for the giant\'s\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\nThe sword the giant swung was nearly four feet long. It cut a sizzling\r\nswath through the air as he approached.\r\n\r\nJon moved back, up against the comforting bulk of the Tower itself, and\r\nprepared to defend the Tower to the death. The giant charged.\r\n\r\nJon parried his wild blow, felt the stinging shock ripple up his arm as\r\ntheir swords clanged together. He initiated an assault of his own, but\r\nthe Wild One laughed derisively and parried as if he were fighting a\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n"Ho, Free One! The Tower is ours!"\r\n\r\n"Not yet," Jon said. "Not while I live!"\r\n\r\n"How long will that be?" the giant asked. "Another minute perhaps?"\r\n\r\nHis sword spun through the air in a shining arc. Jon parried\r\ndesperately, but the force of the blow was too great for him and his\r\nsword went flying out of his numbed hands. He stood there, helpless,\r\nwhile the giant raised his sword for the final blow.\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly six inches of bright steel protruded from the giant\'s\r\nchest. A red fountain of blood bubbled forth. The giant stared in\r\namazement for a second, then began to topple like a felled oak.\r\n\r\nAstonished, Jon looked up and saw the Wild One he had wounded standing\r\nthere, holding a bloody sword.\r\n\r\n"You ... killed him!" Jon said uncomprehendingly. "Why?"\r\n\r\nThe Wild One shook his head uncertainly. "I don\'t know," he said. "I--I\r\nsuddenly realized he had to die."\r\n\r\nExhausted, Jon leaned against the Tower to support himself, and shook\r\nhis head. "Why did you save me? The Tower was yours. Why?"\r\n\r\n"I think I understand," the Wild One said slowly. He threw his sword\r\nto the ground.

"It is something I have long thought of. We fight\r\nyou because we hate you--because we envy your free life. You have\r\nsomething to fight for, in this Tower. I--I want to join you. I want to\r\njoin the Free People!"\r\n\r\nJon smiled. "You\'re welcome to come to our village with me," he said.\r\n"We believe in freedom--the way the Old Ones did."\r\n\r\n"And the Tower? What is its meaning?"\r\n\r\nJon shrugged. "That we do not know, but we defend it because we think\r\nit is sacred to us--to freedom. An old legend, perhaps." He clapped the\r\nother on the back.

"Come, friend. Let\'s signal the mainland that the\r\nbattle is over and the Tower still in free hands."\r\n\r\nHe glanced up at the massive Tower, at the huge statue of the woman\r\nwith her hand outraised, stretching a torch out over the harbor. "I\r\nsuppose we\'ll never know what the Tower really was, to the Ancients.\r\nBut to us--to us, it\'s a symbol of liberty."\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
