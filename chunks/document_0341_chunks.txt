But there was the matter of the pretty\r\n           Martian girl, eliminating Luke, and, of course--\r\n\r\n                                THE AAB\r\n\r\n                          By Edward W. Ludwig\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Imagination Stories of Science and Fantasy\r\n                             February 1955\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cool Martian wind crept across the rust-red expanse of desert.\r\nOccasionally its soft touch stirred the thorny leaves of Devil\'s\r\nEggs--the squat black plants which peppered the silent monotony. Here\r\nand there a wisp of sand spiraled upward into the bright, thin morning.\r\n\r\nThe wind felt clean and new on Monk O\'Hara\'s coarse, blond-stubbled\r\nface. He chuckled as noisily as a man buried neck-deep in sand can\r\nchuckle.\r\n\r\n"Nothing to worry about," he muttered.\r\n\r\n"Not a goddam thing."\r\n\r\nIt was uncomfortable, of course. No man would relish being beaten by\r\nhysterical Martian tribesmen, spat on, and buried to roast in the\r\n100-degree Martian noon or freeze in the 50-below-zero night.\r\n\r\nYet the Summer wind from the melting Polar icecap would insure an\r\nendurable temperature through the day. Monk\'s lungs--enlarged and\r\nsensitized after two years of prospecting for Devil\'s Egg seed--were\r\naccustomed to the planet\'s scant atmosphere. Destruction of his oxygen\r\nmask presented no menace.\r\n\r\n"Idiots," he mumbled. "The fool Martians made off with the sandcar like\r\nkids with ice cream--and left enough Egg seed to buy a thousand cars!"\r\n\r\nHe was able to turn his head just enough to glimpse the heavy, fat\r\nsacks that the tribesmen had dumped out of the sandcar.\r\n\r\nThe sacks bulged with the fine black seed that, properly processed,\r\nmade the deadliest, costliest, and most habit-forming narcotic in\r\nthe System. The sacks were symbols of a shining future for Monk\r\nO\'Hara--symbols of fine clothes, beauteous women, choice whiskey and,\r\nmost important of all, a return to earth.\r\n\r\nOf course, it was too bad about the old man.\r\n\r\nThe white-bearded, toothpick-slim Martian trader and his black-haired\r\ndaughter had pitched their tent next to his camp last night. The girl\r\nhad been amazingly full-bodied for a Martian. Her round, firm body and\r\nsensual lips made him suspect that she was a half-breed, a delightful\r\ncombination of Martian grace and Earthly sultriness.\r\n\r\nMonk smiled as he saw her again in his mind\'s vision.\r\n\r\nShe slid off her antelope-like _lozelle_, came to him slowly with her\r\nsmall, naked feet swishing through the sand.\r\n\r\n"It is all right for us to camp by you?" she asked, her eyes wide. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
"We\r\nwill not bother you?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all," Monk answered, his heart pounding. After all, it\'d been\r\nsix months since he\'d even seen a woman--any kind of woman.\r\n\r\n"What is your name?" the girl asked.\r\n\r\n"Monk, they call me. Monk O\'Hara." He could feel the blood pulsing\r\nthrough his temples.\r\n\r\n"I am Tooli." She curtsied. "You like me?"\r\n\r\n"Yeah," Monk, breathed. "I like you a lot."\r\n\r\nLater, through the ports of his sandcar, he watched her lithe movements\r\nas she and her father set up their tent. Throughout the night, his\r\nsleep was thin and restless, his mind on fire with the vision of the\r\ndark, lovely face.\r\n\r\nSo early this morning he\'d gone to her again. "How about some coffee,\r\nkid? Got plenty in the sandcar."\r\n\r\nShe crinkled her nose teasingly. "Yes, I like Earth coffee. My bocle\r\ncome too?

=== Chunk 3 ===
"\r\n\r\n"No, just you, kid. Your old man\'s busy taking down the tent."\r\n\r\nShe nodded eagerly, smiling. "Yes, I come. I like you."\r\n\r\nWhat greater invitation did a man need?\r\n\r\nBut in the sandcar the little fool screamed. The old Martian darted\r\ninto the car, yanked Monk away from Tooli, and descended on him like an\r\nenraged beast.\r\n\r\nMonk hadn\'t meant to kill the old Martian. He\'d meant only to silence\r\nhis shrill screams and stop the frenzied flailing of his fists.\r\n\r\nHow could he have known that the thin neck would snap like a rotten\r\nstick under his first blow?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMonk\'s smile faded.\r\n\r\nNo, he thought, he hadn\'t acted too wisely. He\'d expected the\r\nfrightened girl to leap out of the sandcar and race away on her\r\n_lozelle_--and she had.\r\n\r\nBut he _hadn\'t_ expected her to return an hour later with a dozen\r\nrevenge-hungry tribesmen. His mistake had been in letting her escape.\r\nHe cursed silently.\r\n\r\nThen he spat. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
After all, it was over and done. The Martians had trussed\r\nhim, buried him, and left him to die--but he\'d at least been wise\r\nenough not to reveal his ace in the hole.\r\n\r\nHis partner, old Stardust Luke, had left yesterday in the auxiliary\r\nsandcar to get fresh supplies from Chandler Field. Old Stardust was as\r\nhonest as a baby and methodical as a clock. He\'d return today, late in\r\nthe afternoon, just as he\'d done a dozen times.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt about the punctual arrival of Stardust. And Stardust\r\nwould save him before the freezing descent of the Martian night.\r\n\r\nMonk thought for a moment, then chuckled again. His glee more than\r\novershadowed the inconvenience of his neck-deep burial.\r\n\r\nFor the rescue would be the last good deed of Stardust Luke\'s life.\r\nIn fact, it would be his _last_ deed. Period. The old space rat had\r\nout-lived his usefulness. If he persisted in wandering over unexplored\r\nMartian terrain he\'d probably end up in a freezing or sweltering grave\r\nanyway.\r\n\r\nSo it wouldn\'t be murder--not exactly. It would only be giving a bit of\r\nimpetus to what already seemed inevitable.\r\n\r\nMonk strained his neck muscles to gaze at the sacks of seed. They would\r\nall be his soon. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Not half, as now. But _all_.\r\n\r\nHe sucked the cool air deep into his lungs.\r\n\r\n"Everything\'s going to be okay," he murmured "--no, not okay, but\r\n_perfect_."\r\n\r\nHe closed his eyes, at peace with the universe. He could forget the\r\npressure of sand on his chest, forget the heat that was beginning to\r\nshower down on his thick, sweat-matted mop of hair. He could imagine\r\nhimself in a cool, dark bar on Earth, surrounded by smiling women,\r\nsipping iced drinks.\r\n\r\n"Ahhh," he breathed, opening his eyes.\r\n\r\nThen he saw the Aab.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt squatted on a small, irregular-shaped dune some three feet from him\r\nin the jagged sharp-edged shadow of a Devil\'s Egg.\r\n\r\nIts eyes, like shiny pin-heads of obsidian, were on a level with his.\r\n\r\nIt was a red-scaled creature, about three inches long, combining the\r\nmost significant characteristics of an Earth crab and an Earth ant. Its\r\nclaws were tiny razor-edged traps on the ends of wire-thin appendages.\r\nEven at this distance, Monk saw that its mouth was open--whether in awe\r\nor in anticipation of a meal, he did not know.\r\n\r\nThe Aab rose on its six rear legs as if trying to stretch its dark\r\nred body into a position of better vision. It rubbed its fore-claws\r\ntogether. Sharpening them, perhaps? Monk shivered.\r\n\r\nFor the first time since his arrival on Mars twelve years ago, Monk\r\nfelt fear. Till now, he\'d met no adversary that his strong, bull-necked\r\nbody could not subdue. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Ordinarily, he\'d dispose of an Aab by a\r\nsquishing stomp of his boot. And he\'d flower the naked grave with a\r\nsquirt of tobacco juice.\r\n\r\nBut now it was as if he were bodiless. His broad shoulders, sinewy arms\r\nand barrel-chest seemed buried a thousand miles deep in the very bowels\r\nof the planet. He was a helpless freak, a living, sliced-off head on an\r\nendless platter of red sand.\r\n\r\nFear was an icy bauble in his mind, rising, swelling, forcing out all\r\nother thought.\r\n\r\n"Go \'way!" he yelled.\r\n\r\nThe Aab\'s claws fell to the sand. Monk saw the menacing glint of the\r\nneedle-like tongue in the creature\'s black, open mouth.\r\n\r\nAabs were carnivorous, he knew. They especially relished the soft,\r\ntender places of the human body--the lips, eyes, tongue.\r\n\r\nTen minutes of attack by a hundred Aabs would transform a man into a\r\nwhite, clean skeleton. About the bones, the Aabs would lie prostrate,\r\ntoo stuffed to move, their bodies swollen to thrice their normal size.\r\n\r\n"Get out of here!" he screamed.\r\n\r\nThe Aab retreated a few inches, backing into the shadow of the Devil\'s\r\nEgg.\r\n\r\n"Go on! And keep going!"\r\n\r\nThe Aab turned and began to creep away. It responded readily to Monk\'s\r\ncommands.\r\n\r\nFor Aabs were gifted with a rudimentary, if unpredictable, type of\r\ntelepathy. No interplanetary circus was complete without its complement\r\nof the deadly creatures controlled by an expert human telepath.\r\n\r\nThe Aab continued to needle a path through the sand. It passed through\r\nthe shadow of the Devil\'s Egg. It was now some six feet from Monk, a\r\ntiny red ball half buried in the desert.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a thought echoed in Monk\'s mind, ever so faintly, like the\r\nbarely distinguishable sound of trickling water, far away:\r\n\r\n_I will come back. Many of us will come._\r\n\r\nMonk paled. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Damn. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
He\'d forgotten. The Aabs, according to biological\r\nreports, sent out scouts in search of food. The Aab before him was a\r\nscout.\r\n\r\nThe fear welled up within him, stronger than ever. His body was held\r\nmotionless in his tight prison, yet inside him he was trembling.\r\n\r\n"No! Don\'t go! 

=== Chunk 9 ===
Come back!"\r\n\r\nHe repeated the words over and over in his mind, knowing that the Aab\r\nwould respond only to the mental impulse, not to the sound of words.\r\nAabs were deaf to the human voice.\r\n\r\nThe Aab paused.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t go! Don\'t! Don\'t!"\r\n\r\nSlowly, like a revolving wheel, the Aab turned. Its black, pin-head\r\neyes seemed to bore into Monk\'s.\r\n\r\n_I\'m going. You cannot stop me._ The thoughts, not words, filtered into\r\nMonk\'s consciousness.\r\n\r\n"You are _not_ going," Monk telepathed. He gritted his teeth, funneling\r\nall his strength into the mental command.\r\n\r\nThe Aab was struggling to break away from the hypnotic chain. Its body\r\nwas grotesquely twisted, its claws digging into the sand, its head\r\nbobbing absurdly.\r\n\r\n_Let me go. Let me go._\r\n\r\n"You can\'t go. I\'ve got you."\r\n\r\n_LET ME GO. LET ME GO._\r\n\r\nThe Aab struggled furiously.\r\n\r\n"Damn you, I won\'t let you go." Monk hurled the thought at the creature\r\nin a fire of desperate fury.\r\n\r\nThe Aab fell, exhausted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFive, ten, fifteen minutes passed. The wind blew. The hot Martian sun\r\ntransformed the desert into a sea of glittering scarlet. A mist of sand\r\nsettled on the inert body of the Aab, camouflaging it.\r\n\r\nHow many minutes more till the arrival of Stardust Luke? It must be\r\nclose to noon. There\'d be perhaps five more hours. Sixty minutes in an\r\nhour, and five hours--\r\n\r\nThe Aab stirred. It began to rise.\r\n\r\nMonk concentrated on the thought: "You can\'t move. I\'ve got you. You\r\ncan\'t rise."\r\n\r\nThe Aab stopped rising.\r\n\r\nMonk licked the perspiration from his upper lip in a futile effort to\r\nquench his thirst. But there was nothing to worry about. Nothing at\r\nall--\r\n\r\nHis head jerked back.\r\n\r\nThe Aab was rising again. It was defying his last command.\r\n\r\nMonk bit his lip. Of course. His mind was tiring just as muscles tire.\r\nHe couldn\'t hope to hold the Aab here all afternoon. The Aab, somehow,\r\nmust be disposed of. But _how_?\r\n\r\nOut of the heat, out of his fear and desperation, came a plan. It\r\nwas simple and direct. It gave Monk his only chance for survival. He\r\nquickly pressed it into the depths of his unconscious mind so that the\r\nAab would not detect it.\r\n\r\n"Come here," he said. "I won\'t hurt you."\r\n\r\n_You will hurt me. You will dispose of me._\r\n\r\nMonk cursed. Aabs weren\'t intelligent, but they possessed some\r\nreasoning power.\r\n\r\n"No, I won\'t hurt you," he telepathed. "Come here. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
Let me see what you\r\nlook like."\r\n\r\n_I am afraid. You have a plan._\r\n\r\nThis time Monk relaxed. He tried to emanate only thoughts of love and\r\nfriendliness.\r\n\r\n"I won\'t hurt you. I promise."\r\n\r\nThe Aab hesitated.\r\n\r\n"I command you to come here. You will not be hurt."\r\n\r\nSlowly, the Aab crawled forward. One inch, two, three, six, a dozen. It\r\nwas only five feet from him now, and in the shadow of the Devil\'s Egg\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"That\'s it. Come on. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
Closer."\r\n\r\n_I am afraid of you. Let me go. Let me go get the others._\r\n\r\nThe Aab suddenly braked its advance by digging its fore-claws into the\r\nsand.\r\n\r\n"But you don\'t want to go back to the others." Monk\'s lips quivered as\r\nhe spoke. His words, to human ears, would have been unintelligible.\r\n"You want to stay here. You want to come closer to me."\r\n\r\nHis attempt at telepathic hypnotism brought a small, silent reply:\r\n\r\n_I must call the others. It is my duty to call the others. The others\r\nare hungry._\r\n\r\nA shudder passed through Monk\'s hot, tight body. A few minutes ago he\r\nhad delighted in the coolness of the desert. Now the heat seemed to be\r\npressing down upon him like the fiery hand of Satan.\r\n\r\n"You\'re a scout, aren\'t you?" he asked. "You find food for the others.\r\nYou go back and tell the others what you\'ve found?"\r\n\r\n_I tell the others. The others are hungry._\r\n\r\n"But you\'re hungry, too. Why share what you\'ve found? Why not take it\r\nall for yourself?"\r\n\r\nNo reply appeared in Monk\'s mind. He continued:\r\n\r\n"Come closer. Look at me. You\'re hungry. You\'re too hungry to waste\r\ntime calling the others."\r\n\r\nThe Aab came closer. It passed out of the shadow of the Devil\'s Egg.\r\nIt came to within two feet of Monk. It crossed the small dune. Slowly,\r\nslowly, its legs labored through the thin sand. At last it stopped some\r\nsix inches from Monk\'s face.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt appeared immense, like a lumbering, scaly giant from the planet\'s\r\nbillion-year-ago past.\r\n\r\nIt rubbed its claws together, threateningly. Its black mouth opened,\r\nclosed, opened, closed. Its needle tongue twisted like a silver snake.\r\n\r\n_I am hungry_, came the thought. _So very hungry. But I should call the\r\nothers._\r\n\r\nCombined fear and hope hung over Monk like an omnipresent shower of\r\nfire and ice. Sweat dripped into his hot eyes, obscuring his vision.\r\n\r\nHe opened his mouth.\r\n\r\n"Look," he said. "You are hungry." He wriggled his tongue as a\r\nfisherman would cast out bait.\r\n\r\n_Hungry, hungry, hungry_, came the tiny voice.\r\n\r\nAn eternity passed. Monk\'s heart was a monstrous hammer pounding in\r\nthe depths of his body and in the depths of the planet. The Aab was\r\nmotionless save for the restless, uncertain moving and blinking of its\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nThen its forelegs lifted. It drew itself forward. One inch, two, three,\r\nfour, five, six.\r\n\r\nMonk beckoned the creature on with his wriggling, twisting tongue.\r\n\r\n"That\'s it!" he telepathed. "Closer, closer!"\r\n\r\nThe Aab entered Monk\'s open mouth.\r\n\r\n_Crunch!_\r\n\r\nMonk chewed and spat and chewed and spat. He grimaced hideously. He\r\ncoughed and choked. The Aab tasted like a combination of paprika and\r\noil. He thought he was going to retch, but did not.\r\n\r\nAnd it was over.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMonk breathed the cool air. His weary mind thought of the stupid\r\nwhite-bearded Martian and of his lovely daughter. He thought of what he\r\nwas going to do to that idiot space rat, Stardust Luke.\r\n\r\nHis gaze traveled to the empty red desert where, in about four hours,\r\nStardust\'s sandcar would appear. It shifted to the sacks of priceless\r\nDevil\'s Egg seed, and he began to chuckle.\r\n\r\nAnd last, his gaze turned to the black, pin-point eyes and the moving\r\nfore-claws of the _two_ Aabs which squatted some three feet away from\r\nhim in the jagged, sharp-edged shadow of a Devil\'s Egg....\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
