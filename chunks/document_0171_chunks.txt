And at the point it is, obviously,\r\nNecessary._\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo king-sized bands blared martial music, the "_Internationale_" and\r\nthe "Star-Spangled Banner," each seemingly trying to drown the other in\r\na _G\xc3\xb6tterd\xc3\xa4mmerung_ of acoustics.\r\n\r\nTwo lines of troops, surfacely differing in uniforms and in weapons, but\r\nbasically so very the same, so evenly matched, came to attention. A\r\nthousand hands slapped a thousand submachine gun stocks.\r\n\r\nMarshal Vladimir Ignatov strode stiff-kneed down the long march, the\r\nstride of a man for years used to cavalry boots. He was flanked by\r\nfrozen visaged subordinates, but none so cold of face as he himself.\r\n\r\nAt the entrance to the conference hall he stopped, turned and waited.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the corridor of troops a car stopped and several figures\r\nemerged, most of them in civilian dress, several bearing brief cases.\r\nThey in their turn ran the gantlet.\r\n\r\nAt their fore walked James Warren Donlevy, spritely, his eyes darting\r\nhere, there, politician-like. A half smile on his face, as though afraid\r\nhe might forget to greet a voter he knew, or was supposed to know.\r\n\r\nHis hand was out before that of Vladimir Ignatov\'s.\r\n\r\n"Your Excellency," he said.\r\n\r\nIgnatov shook hands stiffly. Dropped that of the other\'s as soon as\r\nprotocol would permit.\r\n\r\nThe field marshal indicated the door of the conference hall. "There is\r\nlittle reason to waste time, Mr. President."\r\n\r\n"Exactly," Donlevy snapped.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe door closed behind them and the two men, one uniformed and\r\nbemedaled, the other nattily attired in his business suit, turned to\r\neach other.\r\n\r\n"Nice to see you again, Vovo. How\'re Olga and the baby?"\r\n\r\nThe soldier grinned back in response. "Two babies now--you don\'t keep up\r\non the _real_ news, Jim. How\'s Martha?" They shook hands.\r\n\r\n"Not so good," Jim said, scowling. "I\'m worried. It\'s that new cancer.\r\nAs soon as we conquer one type two more rear up. How are you people\r\ndoing on cancer research?"\r\n\r\nVovo was stripping off his tunic. He hung it over the back of one of the\r\nchairs, began to unbutton his high, tight military collar. "I\'m not\r\nreally up on it, Jim, but I think that\'s one field where you can trust\r\nanything we know to be in the regular scientific journals our people\r\nexchange with yours. I\'ll make some inquiries when I get back home,\r\nthough. You never know, this new strain--I guess you\'d call it--might be\r\none that we\'re up on and you aren\'t."\r\n\r\n"Yeah," Jim said. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
"Thanks a lot." He crossed to the small portable bar.\r\n"How about a drink? Whisky, vodka, rum--there\'s ice."\r\n\r\nVovo slumped into one of the heavy chairs that were arranged around the\r\ntable. He grimaced, "No vodka, I don\'t feel patriotic today. How about\r\none of those long cold drinks, with the cola stuff?"\r\n\r\n"Cuba libra," Jim said. "Coming up. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Look, would you rather speak\r\nRussian?"\r\n\r\n"No," Vovo said, "my English is getting rusty. I need the practice."\r\n\r\nJim brought the glasses over and put them on the table. He began\r\nstripping off his own coat, loosening his tie. "God, I\'m tired," he\r\nsaid. "This sort of thing wears me down."\r\n\r\nVovo sipped his drink. "Now there\'s as good a thing to discuss as any,\r\nin the way of killing time. The truth now, Jim, do you really believe in\r\na God? After all that\'s happened to this human race of ours, do you\r\nreally believe in divine guidance?" He twisted his mouth sarcastically.\r\n\r\nThe other relaxed. "I don\'t know," he said. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
"I suppose so. I was raised\r\nin a family that believed in God. Just as, I suppose, you were raised in\r\none that didn\'t." He lifted his shoulders slightly in a shrug. "Neither\r\nof us seems to be particularly brilliant in establishing a position of\r\nour own."\r\n\r\nVovo snorted. "Never thought of it that way," he admitted. "We\'re\r\nusually contemptuous of anyone still holding to the old beliefs. There\r\naren\'t many left."\r\n\r\n"More than you people admit, I understand."\r\n\r\nVovo shook his heavy head. "No, not really. Mostly crackpots. Have you\r\never noticed how it is that the nonconformists in any society are\r\nusually crackpots? The people on your side that admit belonging to our\r\norganizations, are usually on the wild eyed and uncombed hair side--I\r\nadmit it. On the other hand, the people in our citizenry who subscribe\r\nto your system, your religion, that sort of thing, are crackpots, too.\r\nApplies to religion as well as politics. An atheist in your country is a\r\nnonconformist--in mine, a Christian is. Both crackpots."\r\n\r\nJim laughed and took a sip of his drink.\r\n\r\nVovo yawned and said, "How long are we going to be in here?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. Up to us, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Yes. How about another drink? I\'ll make it. How much of that cola stuff\r\ndo you put in?"\r\n\r\nJim told him, and while the other was on his feet mixing the drinks,\r\nsaid, "You figure on sticking to the same line this year?"\r\n\r\n"Have to," Vovo said over his shoulder. "What\'s the alternative?

=== Chunk 5 ===
"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. We\'re building up to a whale of a depression as it is,\r\neven with half the economy running full blast producing defense\r\nmaterials."\r\n\r\nVovo chuckled, "Defense materials. I wonder if ever in the history of\r\nthe human race anyone ever admitted to producing _offense_ materials."\r\n\r\n"Well, you call it the same thing. All your military equipment is for\r\ndefense. And, of course, according to your press, all ours is for\r\noffense."\r\n\r\n"Of course," Vovo said.\r\n\r\nHe brought the glasses back and handed one to the other. He slumped back\r\ninto his chair again, loosened two buttons of his trousers.\r\n\r\n"Jim," Vovo said, "why don\'t you divert more of your economy to public\r\nworks, better roads, reforestation, dams--that sort of thing."\r\n\r\nJim said wearily, "You\'re a better economist than that. Didn\'t your boy\r\nMarx, or was it Engels, write a small book on the subject? We\'re already\r\noverproducing--turning out more products than we can sell."\r\n\r\n"I wasn\'t talking about your government building new steel mills. But\r\ndams, roads, that sort of thing. You could plow billions into such items\r\nand get some real use out of them. We both know that our weapons will\r\nnever be used--they can\'t be."\r\n\r\nJim ticked them off on his fingers. "We already are producing more farm\r\nproducts than we know what to do with; if we build more dams it\'ll open\r\nup new farm lands and increase the glut. If we build more and better\r\nroads, it will improve transportation, which will mean fewer men will be\r\nable to move greater tonnage--and throw transportation employees into\r\nthe unemployed. If we go all out for reforestation, it will eventually\r\nbring down the price of lumber and the lumber people are howling\r\nalready. No," he shook his head, "there\'s just one really foolproof way\r\nof disposing of surpluses and using up labor power and that\'s war--hot\r\nor cold."\r\n\r\nVovo shrugged, "I suppose so."\r\n\r\n"It amounts to building pyramids, of course." Jim twisted his mouth\r\nsourly. "And since we\'re asking questions about each other\'s way of\r\nlife, when is your State going to begin to _wither away_?

=== Chunk 6 ===
"\r\n\r\n"How was that?" Vovo asked.\r\n\r\n"According to your sainted founder, once you people came to power the\r\nState was going to wither away, class rule would be over, and Utopia be\r\non hand. That was a long time ago, and your State is stronger than\r\nours."\r\n\r\nVovo snorted. "How can we wither away the State as long as we are\r\nthreatened by capitalist aggression?"\r\n\r\nJim said, "Ha!

=== Chunk 7 ===
"\r\n\r\nVovo went on. "You know better than that, Jim. The only way my\r\norganization can keep in power is by continually beating the drums,\r\nkeeping our people stirred up to greater and greater sacrifices by using\r\nyou as a threat. Didn\'t the old Romans have some sort of maxim to the\r\neffect that when you\'re threatened with unease at home stir up trouble\r\nabroad?"\r\n\r\n"You\'re being even more frank than usual," Jim said. "But that\'s one of\r\nthe pleasures of these get-togethers, neither of us resorts to\r\nhypocrisy. But you can\'t keep up these tensions forever."\r\n\r\n"You mean _we_ can\'t keep up these tensions forever, Jim. And when they\r\nend? Well, personally I can\'t see my organization going out without a\r\nblood bath." He grimaced sourly, "And since I\'d probably be one of the\r\nfirst to be bathed, I\'d like to postpone the time. It\'s like having a\r\ntiger by the tail, Jim. We can\'t let go."\r\n\r\n"Happily, I don\'t feel in the same spot," Jim said. He got up and went\r\nto the picture window that took up one entire wall. It faced out over a\r\nmountain vista. He looked soberly into the sky.\r\n\r\nVovo joined him, glass in hand.\r\n\r\n"Possibly your position isn\'t exactly the same as ours but there\'ll be\r\nsome awfully great changes if that military based economy of yours\r\nsuddenly had peace thrust upon it. You\'d have a depression such as\r\nyou\'ve never dreamed of. Let\'s face reality, Jim, neither of us can\r\nafford peace."\r\n\r\n"Well, we\'ve both known that for a long time."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey both considered somberly, the planet Earth blazing away, a small\r\nsun there in the sky.\r\n\r\nJim said, "I sometimes think that the race would have been better off,\r\nwhen man was colonizing Venus and Mars, if it had been a joint\r\nenterprise rather than you people doing one, and we the other. If it had\r\nall been in the hands of that organization ..."\r\n\r\n"The United Nations?" Vovo supplied.\r\n\r\n"... Then when Bomb Day hit, perhaps these new worlds could have gone on\r\nto, well, better things."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps," Vovo shrugged. "I\'ve often wondered how Bomb Day started. Who\r\nstruck the spark."\r\n\r\n"Happily there were enough colonists on both planets to start the race\r\nall over again," Jim said. "What difference does it make, who struck the\r\nspark?

=== Chunk 8 ===
"\r\n\r\n"None, I suppose." Vovo began to button his collar, readjust his\r\nclothes. "Well, shall we emerge and let the quaking multitudes know that\r\nonce again we have made a shaky agreement? One that will last until the\r\nnext summit meeting."\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note\r\n\r\nIn two places in the text the word "reforestration" was corrected to\r\n"reforestation."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
