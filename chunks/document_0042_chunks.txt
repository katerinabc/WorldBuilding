Here is a profound story based on that thought--a\r\n    story which may well forecast one of the problems to be encountered\r\n    in space travel._\r\n\r\n\r\n   lost\r\n     in\r\n    the\r\n future\r\n\r\n _by ... John Victor Peterson_\r\n\r\n\r\n They had discovered a new planet--but its people\r\n did not see them until after they had traveled on.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlbrecht and I went down in a shuttleship, leaving the stellatomic\r\norbited pole-to-pole two thousand miles above Alpha Centauri\'s second\r\nplanet. While we took an atmosphere-brushing approach which wouldn\'t\r\nburn off the shuttle\'s skin, we went as swiftly as we could.\r\n\r\nA week before we had completed man\'s first trip through hyperspace.\r\nWe were now making the first landing on an inhabited planet of\r\nanother sun. All the preliminary investigations had been made via\r\nelectronspectroscopes and electrontelescopes from the stellatomic.\r\n\r\nWe knew that the atmosphere was breathable and were reasonably certain\r\nthat the peoples of the world into whose atmosphere we were dropping\r\nwere at peace. We went unarmed, just the two of us; it might not be wise\r\nto go in force.\r\n\r\nWe were silent, and I know that Harry Albrecht was as perplexed as I was\r\nover the fact that our all-wave receivers failed to pick up any signs of\r\nradio communication whatever. We had assumed that we would pick up\r\nsignals of some type as soon as we had passed down through the\r\nunfamiliar planet\'s ionosphere.\r\n\r\nThe scattered arrangement of the towering cities appeared to call for\r\nradio communications. The hundreds of atmosphere ships flashing along a\r\nsystem of airways between the cities seemed to indicate the existence of\r\nelectronic navigational and landing aids. But perhaps the signals were\r\nall tightly beamed; we would know when we came lower.\r\n\r\nWe dropped down into the airway levels, and still our receivers failed\r\nto pick up a signal of any sort--not even a whisper of static. And\r\nstrangely, our radarscopes failed to record even a blip from their\r\natmosphere ships!\r\n\r\n"I guess it\'s our equipment, Harry," I said. "It just doesn\'t seem to\r\nfunction in this atmosphere.

We\'ll have to put Edwards to work on it\r\nwhen we go back upstairs."\r\n\r\nWe spotted an airport on the outskirts of a large city. The runways were\r\nlaid out with the precision of Earth\'s finest. I put our ship\'s nose\r\neastward on a runway and took it down fast through a lull in the\r\natmosphere ship traffic.\r\n\r\nAs we went down I saw tiny buildings spotted on the field which surely\r\nhoused electronic equipment, but our receivers remained silent.\r\n\r\nI taxied the shuttle up to an unloading ramp before the airport\'s\r\nterminal building and I killed the drive.\r\n\r\n"Harry," I said, "if it weren\'t that their ships are so outlandishly\r\nstubby and their buildings so outflung, we might well be on Earth!"\r\n\r\n"I agree, Captain. Strange, though, that they\'re not mobbing us. They\r\ncouldn\'t take this delta-winged job for one of their ships!"\r\n\r\nIt _was_ strange.\r\n\r\nI looked up at the observation ramp\'s occupants--people who except for\r\ntheir bizarre dress might well be of Earth--and saw no curiosity in the\r\neyes that sometimes swept across our position.\r\n\r\n"Be that as it may, Harry, we certainly should cause a stir in these\r\npressure suits. Let\'s go!"\r\n\r\nWe walked up to a dour-looking individual at a counter at the ramp\'s\r\nend.

Clearing my throat, I said rather inanely, "Hello!"--but what\r\n_does_ one say to an extrasolarian?\r\n\r\nI realized then that my voice seemed thunderous, that the only other\r\nsounds came from a distance: the city\'s noise, the atmosphere ships\'\r\nengines on the horizon--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Centaurian ignored us.\r\n\r\nI looked at the atmosphere ships in the clear blue sky, at the\r\nCentaurians on the ramp who appeared to be conversing--and there was no\r\nsound from those planes, no sound from the people!\r\n\r\n"It\'s impossible," Harry said. "The atmosphere\'s nearly Earth-normal. It\r\nshould be--well, damn it, it _is_ as sound-conductive; _we\'re_ talking,\r\naren\'t we?"\r\n\r\nI looked up at the Centaurians again. They were looking excitedly\r\nwestward. Some turned to companions. Mouths opened and closed to form\r\nwords we could not hear.

Wide eyes lowered, following something I could\r\nnot see. Sick inside, I turned to Albrecht and read confirmation in his\r\ndrawn, blanched face.\r\n\r\n"Captain," he said, "I suspected that we might find something like this\r\nwhen we first came out of hyperspace and the big sleep. The recorders\r\nshowed we\'d exceeded light-speed in normal space-time just after the\r\ntransition. Einstein theorized that time would not pass as swiftly to\r\nthose approaching light-speed. We could safely exceed that speed in\r\nhyperspace but should never have done so in normal space-time. Beyond\r\nlight-speed time must conversely accelerate!\r\n\r\n"These people haven\'t seen _us_ yet. They certainly just observed our\r\nlanding. As we suspected, they probably do have speech and radio--but we\r\ncan\'t pick up either. We\'re seconds ahead of them in time and we can\'t\r\npick up from the past sounds of nearby origin or nearby signals radiated\r\nat light-speed. They\'ll see and hear us soon, but we\'ll never receive an\r\nanswer from _them_! Our questions will come to them in their future but\r\nwe can never pick answers from their past!"\r\n\r\n"Let\'s go, Harry," I said quickly.\r\n\r\n"Where?" he asked. "Where can we ever go that will be an improvement\r\nover this?" He was resigned.\r\n\r\n"Back into space," I said. "Back to circle this system at a\r\nnear-light-speed. The computers should be able to determine how long and\r\nhow slow we\'ll have to fly to cancel this out. If not, we are truly and\r\nforever lost!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ January 1954.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.
