It is made of loosely\r\nwoven strips of steel, and there is no mattress, only an extra blanket\r\nof thin olive-drab. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
It isn\'t comfortable; but of course they expect to\r\nmake me still more uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nThey expect to take me out of this precinct jail to the District prison\r\nand eventually to the death house.\r\n\r\nSure, there will be a trial first, but that is only a formality. Not\r\nonly did they catch me with the smoking gun in my hand and Connaught\r\nbubbling to death through the hole in his throat, but I admitted it.\r\n\r\nI--knowing what I was doing, with, as they say, malice\r\naforethought--deliberately shot to death Laurence Connaught.\r\n\r\nThey execute murderers. So they mean to execute me.\r\n\r\nEspecially because Laurence Connaught had saved my life.\r\n\r\nWell, there are extenuating circumstances. I do not think they would\r\nconvince a jury.\r\n\r\nConnaught and I were close friends for years. We lost touch during the\r\nwar. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
We met again in Washington, a few years after the war was over. We\r\nhad, to some extent, grown apart; he had become a man with a mission.\r\nHe was working very hard on something and he did not choose to discuss\r\nhis work and there was nothing else in his life on which to form a basis\r\nfor communication. And--well, I had my own life, too. It wasn\'t\r\nscientific research in my case--I flunked out of med school, while he\r\nwent on. I\'m not ashamed of it; it is nothing to be ashamed of. I simply\r\nwas not able to cope with the messy business of carving corpses. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
I\r\ndidn\'t like it, I didn\'t want to do it, and when I was forced to do it,\r\nI did it badly. So--I left.\r\n\r\nThus I have no string of degrees, but you don\'t need them in order to be\r\na Senate guard.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDoes that sound like a terribly impressive career to you? Of course not;\r\nbut I liked it. The Senators are relaxed and friendly when the guards\r\nare around, and you learn wonderful things about what goes on behind the\r\nscenes of government. And a Senate guard is in a position to do\r\nfavors--for newspapermen, who find a lead to a story useful; for\r\ngovernment officials, who sometimes base a whole campaign on one\r\ncareless, repeated remark; and for just about anyone who would like to\r\nbe in the visitors\' gallery during a hot debate.\r\n\r\nLarry Connaught, for instance. I ran into him on the street one day, and\r\nwe chatted for a moment, and he asked if it was possible to get him in\r\nto see the upcoming foreign relations debate. It was; I called him the\r\nnext day and told him I had arranged for a pass. And he was there,\r\nwatching eagerly with his moist little eyes, when the Secretary got up\r\nto speak and there was that sudden unexpected yell, and the handful of\r\nCentral American fanatics dragged out their weapons and began trying to\r\nchange American policy with gunpowder.\r\n\r\nYou remember the story, I suppose. There were only three of them, two\r\nwith guns, one with a hand grenade. The pistol men managed to wound two\r\nSenators and a guard. I was right there, talking to Connaught. I spotted\r\nthe little fellow with the hand grenade and tackled him. I knocked him\r\ndown, but the grenade went flying, pin pulled, seconds ticking away. I\r\nlunged for it. Larry Connaught was ahead of me.\r\n\r\nThe newspaper stories made heroes out of both of us. They said it was\r\nmiraculous that Larry, who had fallen right on top of the grenade, had\r\nmanaged to get it away from himself and so placed that when it exploded\r\nno one was hurt.\r\n\r\nFor it did go off--and the flying steel touched nobody. The papers\r\nmentioned that Larry had been knocked unconscious by the blast. He was\r\nunconscious, all right.\r\n\r\nHe didn\'t come to for six hours and when he woke up, he spent the next\r\nwhole day in a stupor.\r\n\r\nI called on him the next night. He was glad to see me.\r\n\r\n"That was a close one, Dick," he said. "Take me back to Tarawa."\r\n\r\nI said, "I guess you saved my life, Larry."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, Dick! I just jumped. Lucky, that\'s all."\r\n\r\n"The papers said you were terrific. They said you moved so fast, nobody\r\ncould see exactly what happened."\r\n\r\nHe made a deprecating gesture, but his wet little eyes were wary.\r\n"Nobody was really watching, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"I was watching," I told him flatly.\r\n\r\nHe looked at me silently for a moment.\r\n\r\n"I was between you and the grenade," I said. "You didn\'t go past me,\r\nover me, or through me. But you were on top of the grenade."\r\n\r\nHe started to shake his head.\r\n\r\nI said, "Also, Larry, you fell _on_ the grenade. It exploded underneath\r\nyou. I know, because I was almost on top of you, and it blew you clear\r\noff the floor of the gallery. Did you have a bulletproof vest on?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe cleared his throat. "Well, as a matter of--"\r\n\r\n"Cut it out, Larry! What\'s the answer?"\r\n\r\nHe took off his glasses and rubbed his watery eyes. He grumbled, "Don\'t\r\nyou read the papers? It went off a yard away."\r\n\r\n"Larry," I said gently, "I was there."\r\n\r\nHe slumped back in his chair, staring at me. Larry Connaught was a small\r\nman, but he never looked smaller than he did in that big chair, looking\r\nat me as though I were Mr. Nemesis himself.\r\n\r\nThen he laughed. He surprised me; he sounded almost happy. He said,\r\n"Well, hell, Dick--I had to tell somebody about it sooner or later. Why\r\nnot you?"\r\n\r\nI can\'t tell you all of what he said. I\'ll tell most of it--but not the\r\npart that matters.\r\n\r\nI\'ll never tell _that_ part to _anybody_.\r\n\r\nLarry said, "I should have known you\'d remember." He smiled at me\r\nruefully, affectionately. "Those bull sessions in the cafeterias, eh?\r\nTalking all night about everything. But you remembered."\r\n\r\n"You claimed that the human mind possessed powers of psychokinesis," I\r\nsaid. "You argued that just by the mind, without moving a finger or\r\nusing a machine, a man could move his body anywhere, instantly. You said\r\nthat nothing was impossible to the mind."\r\n\r\nI felt like an absolute fool saying those things; they were ridiculous\r\nnotions. Imagine a man _thinking_ himself from one place to another!\r\nBut--I had been on that gallery.\r\n\r\nI licked my lips and looked to Larry Connaught for confirmation.\r\n\r\n"I was all wet," Larry laughed. "Imagine!"\r\n\r\nI suppose I showed surprise, because he patted my shoulder.\r\n\r\nHe said, becoming sober, "Sure, Dick, you\'re wrong, but you\'re right\r\nall the same. The mind alone can\'t do anything of the sort--that was\r\njust a silly kid notion. But," he went on, "_but_ there are--well,\r\ntechniques--linking the mind to physical forces--simple physical forces\r\nthat we all use every day--that can do it all. Everything! Everything I\r\never thought of and things I haven\'t found out yet.\r\n\r\n"Fly across the ocean? In a second, Dick! Wall off an exploding bomb?\r\nEasily! You saw me do it. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Oh, it\'s work. It takes energy--you can\'t\r\nescape natural law. That was what knocked me out for a whole day. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
But\r\nthat was a hard one; it\'s a lot easier, for instance, to make a bullet\r\nmiss its target. It\'s even easier to lift the cartridge out of the\r\nchamber and put it in my pocket, so that the bullet can\'t even be fired.\r\nWant the Crown Jewels of England? I could get them, Dick!

=== Chunk 7 ===
"\r\n\r\nI asked, "Can you see the future?"\r\n\r\nHe frowned. "That\'s silly. This isn\'t supersti--"\r\n\r\n"How about reading minds?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLarry\'s expression cleared. "Oh, you\'re remembering some of the things I\r\nsaid years ago. No, I can\'t do that either, Dick. Maybe, some day, if I\r\nkeep working at this thing-- Well, I can\'t right now. There are things I\r\ncan do, though, that are just as good."\r\n\r\n"Show me something you can do," I asked.\r\n\r\nHe smiled. Larry was enjoying himself; I didn\'t begrudge it to him. He\r\nhad hugged this to himself for years, from the day he found his first\r\nclue, through the decade of proving and experimenting, almost always\r\nbeing wrong, but always getting closer.... He _needed_ to talk about it.\r\nI think he was really glad that, at last, someone had found him out.\r\n\r\nHe said, "Show you something? Why, let\'s see, Dick." He looked around\r\nthe room, then winked. "See that window?"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI looked. It opened with a slither of wood and a rumble of sash weights.\r\nIt closed again.\r\n\r\n"The radio," said Larry. There was a _click_ and his little set turned\r\nitself on. "Watch it."\r\n\r\nIt disappeared and reappeared.\r\n\r\n"It was on top of Mount Everest," Larry said, panting a little.\r\n\r\nThe plug on the radio\'s electric cord picked itself up and stretched\r\ntoward the baseboard socket, then dropped to the floor again.\r\n\r\n"No," said Larry, and his voice was trembling, "I\'ll show you a hard\r\none. Watch the radio, Dick. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
I\'ll run it without plugging it in! The\r\nelectrons themselves--"\r\n\r\nHe was staring intently at the little set. I saw the dial light go on,\r\nflicker, and hold steady; the speaker began to make scratching noises. I\r\nstood up, right behind Larry, right over him.\r\n\r\nI used the telephone on the table beside him. I caught him right beside\r\nthe ear and he folded over without a murmur. Methodically, I hit him\r\ntwice more, and then I was sure he wouldn\'t wake up for at least an\r\nhour. I rolled him over and put the telephone back in its cradle.\r\n\r\nI ransacked his apartment. I found it in his desk: All his notes. All\r\nthe information. The secret of how to do the things he could do.\r\n\r\nI picked up the telephone and called the Washington police. When I heard\r\nthe siren outside, I took out my service revolver and shot him in the\r\nthroat. He was dead before they came in.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor, you see, I knew Laurence Connaught. We were friends. I would have\r\ntrusted him with my life. But this was more than just a life.\r\n\r\nTwenty-three words told how to do the things that Laurence Connaught\r\ndid. Anyone who could read could do them. Criminals, traitors,\r\nlunatics--the formula would work for anyone.\r\n\r\nLaurence Connaught was an honest man and an idealist, I think. But what\r\nwould happen to any man when he became God? Suppose you were told\r\ntwenty-three words that would let you reach into any bank vault, peer\r\ninside any closed room, walk through any wall? Suppose pistols could not\r\nkill you?\r\n\r\nThey say power corrupts; and absolute power corrupts absolutely. And\r\nthere can be no more absolute power than the twenty-three words that can\r\nfree a man of any jail or give him anything he wants. Larry was my\r\nfriend. But I killed him in cold blood, knowing what I did, because he\r\ncould not be trusted with the secret that could make him king of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nBut I can.\r\n\r\n                                                       --FREDERIK POHL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Galaxy Science Fiction_ February 1955.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.
