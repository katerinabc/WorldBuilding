DISCH\r\n\r\n         _The stranger would not admit that New Katanga was a\r\n          paradise, though he accepted citizenship willingly\r\n            enough. Little did he know that he was right._\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n                     Amazing Stories August 1963.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n"But I assure you ..." his guide replied.\r\n\r\n"There\'s always a fly in the ointment," the visitor continued.\r\n"Injustice is part of human nature. A society can\'t do without it."\r\n\r\n"These are special conditions."\r\n\r\n"_That_ is the first injustice. Other planets don\'t have gobblers."\r\n\r\n"But they do!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s not the same thing. You\'ve seen the gobbler-fleece from Morpheus\r\nIX. It\'s no better than wool. Only here in New Katanga...."\r\n\r\n"Utopia," his guide corrected.\r\n\r\n"Only here is their fleece as tough as iron--"\r\n\r\n"And soft to the touch as watered silk." His guide sighed deeply;\r\ntruly, there was nothing like gobbler-fleece.\r\n\r\n"Your planet\'s prosperity is possible, however, only at the expense of\r\nFederation worlds that can\'t raise gobblers."\r\n\r\n"True," his guide agreed wanly.\r\n\r\n"If New Katanga would reveal to the Federation the secret of the\r\ngobbler-fleece--the special process you have developed here, I assure\r\nyou...."\r\n\r\n"On your right," his guide pointed out, "you will observe our new Civic\r\nAuditorium, renowned throughout the galaxy for the classic beauty of\r\nits proportions...."\r\n\r\n"I _assure_ you that I would not be so apt to suspect the motive of\r\nyour utopian pretensions."\r\n\r\n"Each panel of the glass wall is in the ratio 2:3. The sculpture in\r\nthe center of the fountain was executed at enormous expense by Berndt\r\nThorwald, the Terran--who was since naturalized. It is an allegory of\r\nPeace, Prosperity, and Freedom."\r\n\r\n"--!" the visitor grunted.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it is necessary, as you suggest, for a utopia to be isolated\r\nto a certain degree. We do enjoy advantages here that are wanting\r\non--what did you say your home-world is called?"\r\n\r\n"Aridity VI."\r\n\r\n"Just so. Yet, our chief advantage is not our monopoly of\r\ngobbler-fleece but the perfection of our social institutions. Here\r\nthere is no crime, no war, no politics, no hunger, and little disease.\r\nOur Utopians are not greedy, envious, wrathful, lazy, or bedeviled with\r\nlusts...."\r\n\r\n"Come again! Every night, there\'s a line outside my bedroom door, five\r\ndeep. Not that I object, but in the Land of the Pure it seems a strange\r\nthing."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHis guide tried to conceal his smile. "It is because you are a visitor.\r\nA certain romantic charm attaches to your peculiar position. An aura.\r\nOn the whole, our citizens are more moderate in their appetites.\r\nPuritanism, too, is a short-coming. You have been enjoying your stay, I\r\ntake it?

"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes!"\r\n\r\n"The food?"\r\n\r\n"Excellent. I must have gained thirty pounds."\r\n\r\nHis guide nodded appreciatively at the visitor\'s girth. "You will\r\nfind, as you grow accustomed to plenty, that even moderation has its\r\npleasures. But I will not make sermons. Have you enjoyed the weather?"\r\n\r\n"Just the right amount of zip. Your engineers are geniuses."\r\n\r\n"Our schools and hospitals, our roads and public buildings?"\r\n\r\n"In all those things, you are the paragon of the galaxy. And the\r\nprivate homes that I have seen are models of restrained munificence."\r\n\r\n"They were selected at random."\r\n\r\n"Of course, I knew long before my visit that your artists and\r\nscientists...."\r\n\r\n"Virtually the whole population," his guide put in.\r\n\r\n"--are without peer."\r\n\r\n"And yet you deny us the title of Utopia?"\r\n\r\n"Utopia? Never!"

the visitor said adamantly. "There\'s always a worm in\r\nthe rose. I just have not found it yet, but it\'s there. Injustice is a\r\npart of human nature."\r\n\r\n"What a shame! I had hoped that you would accept full citizenship."\r\n\r\n"Full cit--" the visitor gasped, letting his 280 pounds settle slowly\r\nonto a teakwood park bench.\r\n\r\n"Yes. But since...."\r\n\r\n"Show me the papers."\r\n\r\n"But as a representative of the Federation?"\r\n\r\n"I renounce Federation citizenship. What do I sign?"\r\n\r\n"Here. And here.

And here.

Good." He tucked the papers into a small\r\nleather carrying case.\r\n\r\n"It seems to me that, with so permissive an immigration policy, New\r\nKatanga will soon be overrun."\r\n\r\n"On the contrary, exclusivity would be unjust and, in the long run,\r\nunprofitable. A society always can use fresh blood. Besides, we have a\r\nstable population rate, all things considered.

"\r\n\r\n"Well, I feel like celebrating."\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t we take in the matinee performance at the Auditorium then.\r\nAdmission, like everything else in Utopia, is free. The performances\r\nare quite hair-raising, something on the order of the Roman _Circus_,\r\nI\'m told."\r\n\r\nThe new citizen raised an eye-brow. "In Utopia?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s a healthy outlet for our small aggressions."\r\n\r\nThey walked up the marble staircase to the Grand Circle.\r\n\r\n"Would you wait for me a few minutes in my box? I have some things to\r\nattend to."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe visitor entered the box through a great door, heavily crusted with\r\ngold. His seat afforded him an excellent view of the arena. All the\r\nUtopians in the tiers above and across from his box stopped chattering\r\nand turned, as one man, to gaze at him. The new citizen recognized\r\nseveral women of recent acquaintance and waved to them. They waved\r\nback. One kissed her sheer gobbler-fleece scarf and threw it toward\r\nhim. It billowed in the warm air of the auditorium and sank gracefully\r\nto the floor of the arena. There was restrained applause.\r\n\r\nThe lights dimmed. The entrance-gates at the far end of the arena\r\nopened with a clank. The gobblers bounded out with that curious, lithe\r\nmotion so strange in creatures of their bulk. They circled the arena\r\nand came to a stop underneath the new citizen\'s box, where, lips\r\npressed back from their terrible fangs, they mewled softly.\r\n\r\nWith an almost imperceptible _click_, the box was disengaged from\r\nits moorings and swung free over the arena. Then with slow, pendular\r\nmotions it descended to the floor.\r\n\r\nThe audience cheered wildly as the gobblers leaped, like great-maned\r\nantelopes, over the railing of the box and tore the new citizen of\r\nUtopia into shreds. Even as they gulped down the huge chunks of fatty\r\ntissue, the spectator could see their fleece change from a tone of drab\r\nnickel to a sheen something between the glint of polished steel and the\r\nshimmer of watered silk.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
