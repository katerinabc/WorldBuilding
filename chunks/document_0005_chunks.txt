O. Henry could\r\n have been proud of it. It could well become a\r\n minor classic._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Last Supper\r\n\r\nBy T. D. Hamm\r\n\r\n\r\nHampered as she was by the child in her arms, the woman was running less\r\nfleetly now. A wave of exultation swept over Guldran, drowning out the\r\nuneasy feeling of guilt at disobeying orders.\r\n\r\nThe instructions were mandatory and concise: "_No_ capture must be\r\nattempted individually. In the event of sighting any form of human life,\r\nthe ship MUST be notified immediately. All small craft must be back at\r\nthe landing space not later than one hour before take-off. Anyone not so\r\nreporting will be presumed lost."\r\n\r\nGuldran thought uneasily of the great seas of snow and ice sweeping\r\ninexorably toward each other since the Earth had reversed on its axis in\r\nthe great catastrophe a millennium ago. Now, summer and winter alike\r\nbrought paralyzing gales and blizzards, heralded by the sleety snow in\r\nwhich the woman\'s skin-clad feet had left the tracks which led to\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\nHis trained anthropologist\'s mind speculated avidly over the little they\r\nhad gotten from the younger of the two men found nearly a week before,\r\nnearly frozen and half-starved. The older man had succumbed almost at\r\nonce; the other, in the most primitive sign language, had indicated\r\nthat, of several humans living in caves to the west, only he and the\r\nother had survived to flee some mysterious terror. Guldran felt a throb\r\nof pity for the woman and her child, left behind by the men, no doubt,\r\nas a hindrance.\r\n\r\nBut what a stroke of fortune that there should be left a male and female\r\nof the race to carry the seed of Terra to another planet. And what a\r\ntriumph if he, Guldran, should be the one to return at the eleventh hour\r\nwith the prize. No need of calling for help. This was no armed\r\nwar-party, but the most defenseless being in the Universe--a mother\r\nburdened with a child.\r\n\r\nGuldran put on another burst of speed. His previous shouts had served\r\nonly to spur the woman to greater efforts. Surely there was _some_ magic\r\nword that had survived even the centuries of illiteracy. Something\r\nequivalent to the "bread and salt" of all illiterate peoples. Cupping\r\nhis hands to his mouth, he shouted, "Food!

food!"\r\n\r\nAhead of him the woman turned her head, leaped lightly in mid-stride,\r\nand went on; slowing a little but still running doggedly.\r\n\r\nGuldran\'s pulse leaped. He yelled again, "Food!"\r\n\r\nThe instant that his foot touched the yielding surface of the trap, he\r\nknew that he had met defeat. As his body crashed down on the\r\nfire-sharpened stakes, he knew too the terror from which the last men of\r\nthe human race had fled.\r\n\r\nAbove him the woman looked down, her teeth gleaming wolfishly. She\r\npointed down into the pit; spoke exultantly to the child.\r\n\r\n"Food!" said the last woman on earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _If Worlds of Science Fiction_\r\n    September 1952.
