Dickson\r\n\r\n               If the alien space craft was not a rocket\r\n            ship, what was it? And an even bigger question:\r\n           should they investigate--or run for their lives!\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Imagination Stories of Science and Fantasy\r\n                               May 1952\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will not consider the odds involved in their finding the stranger,\r\nfor the odds were impossible.\r\n\r\nThey came down to rest their tubes on an unnamed planet of a\r\nlittle-known star in the Buckhorn Cluster. Because they were tired from\r\nweeks in space, they came in without looking. They circled the planet\r\nonce and spiraled down to an open patch of sand between two rocky\r\ncliffs. Only then did they see the other ship.\r\n\r\nJeff Wadley was at the controls and his eyes widened when he saw it.\r\nBut his fingers did not hesitate on the controls, for a deep-space\r\nstarship is not the kind of vehicle that can change its mind about\r\nlanding once it is within half a mile of the ground. He brought the\r\nEmerald Girl in smoothly to a stop not five hundred feet from the\r\nstranger. Then he sat back.\r\n\r\n"Dad," he said flatly, into the intercom, "swing the turret!"\r\n\r\nPeter Wadley, up in the instrument room, had already seen the strange\r\nship, and the heavy twin barrels of the automatic rifles were\r\ndepressing to cover. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
Jeff leaned forward to the communicator.\r\n\r\n"_Identify yourself!_" The tight beam in Common Code snapped across\r\nthe little stretch of open sand to the cliff against which the other\r\nseemed to nestle. "We are the mining ship Emerald Girl, Earth license,\r\nfive hundred and eighty-two days out of Arcturus Station. _Identify\r\nyourself!_"\r\n\r\nThere were steps behind Jeff, and Peter Wadley came to stand behind his\r\nson\'s tense back.\r\n\r\n"Do they answer, Jeff?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"_Identify yourself. Identify yourself! Identify yourself!_"\r\n\r\nThe angry demand crackled and arced invisibly across the space between\r\nboth vessels. And there was no answer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJeff sat back from the communicator. The palms of his hands were wet\r\nand he wiped them on the cloth of his breeches.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s get out of here," he said nervously.\r\n\r\n"And leave _him_?" his father\'s lean forefinger indicated the strange\r\nsilent ship.\r\n\r\n"Why not?" Jeff jerked his face up. "We\'re no salvage outfit or\r\nGovernment exploration unit."\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of tenseness between them. The older man\'s face\r\ntightened.\r\n\r\n"We\'d better look into it," he said.\r\n\r\n"Are you crazy?" blazed Jeff. "It was here when we came. It\'ll be here\r\nif we leave. Let\'s get going. We can report it if you want. Let the\r\nFederal ships investigate."\r\n\r\n"Maybe it just landed," his father said evenly. "Maybe it\'s in trouble."\r\n\r\n"What if it is?" Jeff insisted. "Don\'t you realize we\'re a sitting\r\ntarget here? And what do you think it is--Aunt Susie\'s runabout? 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Look\r\nat it!" And with a savage flip of his hand he shoved the magnification\r\nof the viewing screen up so that the other ship seemed to loom up a\r\nhandbreadth beyond their walls.\r\n\r\nIt was an unnecessary gesture. There was no mistaking that the lines\r\nof the other ship were foreign to any they had ever seen. It was big:\r\nnot outlandishly big, but bigger than the Emerald Girl, and bulb-shaped\r\nwith most of its bulk in front. There was no sign of ports or\r\nairlocks, only a few stubby fins, which projected forlornly from the\r\nbody at an angle of some thirty degrees.\r\n\r\nAnd from its silence and immobility, its strange inhuman lines, a cold\r\nair of alien menace seemed to reach out to chill the two watching men.\r\n\r\n"Well?" challenged Jeff. But the older man was not listening.\r\n\r\n"The radarcamera," he said, half to himself. He turned on his heel and\r\nstalked off. Jeff, sitting tensely in his chair, heard his father\'s\r\nfootsteps die away, to be succeeded seconds later by the distant clumsy\r\nsounds of a man getting into a spacesuit. Jeff swore, and jumping to\r\nhis feet, ran to the airlock. His father, radarcamera at his feet, was\r\nalready half-dressed to go outside.\r\n\r\n"You aren\'t going out there?" he asked incredulously.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe older man nodded and picked up his fishbowl helmet. Jeff\'s face\r\ntwisted in dismay.\r\n\r\n"I won\'t let you!" he half-shouted. "You\'re risking your life and I\r\ncan\'t navigate the ship without you."\r\n\r\nHelmet in hand, his father paused, the deep-graved lines of his face\r\nstiffening.\r\n\r\n"I\'m still master of this ship!" he said curtly. "Alien or not that\r\nother ship may need assistance. By intraspace law I\'m obliged to give\r\nit. If you\'re worried, cover me from the gun-turret." He dropped the\r\nhelmet over his head, cutting Jeff off from further protest.\r\n\r\nSeething with mixed fear and anger, Jeff turned abruptly and climbed\r\nhurriedly to the gun-turret. The twin barrels of the rifles were\r\nalready centered on their target, which the aiming screen showed,\r\ntogether with the area between the two vessels and a portion of the\r\nEmerald Girl\'s airlock, which projected from her side. As Jeff watched,\r\nthe outer lock swung open and a grey, space-suited figure raced for\r\nthe protection of the bow. It was a dash of no more than five seconds\'\r\nduration, but to Jeff it seemed that his father took an eternity to\r\nreach safety.\r\n\r\nHe reached for the microphone on the ship\'s circuit and pulled it to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"All right, Dad?" In spite of himself, Jeff\'s voice was still ragged\r\nwith anger.\r\n\r\n"Fine, Jeff," his father\'s voice came back in unperturbed tones. "I\'m\r\nwell shielded and I can get good, clean shots at every part of her."\r\n\r\n"Let me know when you\'re ready to start back," said Jeff, and shoved\r\nthe microphone away from him.\r\n\r\nHe sat back and lit a cigarette, but his eyes continued to watch the\r\nother ship as a man might watch a dud bomb which has not yet been\r\ndisarmed. After a while, he noticed his fingers were shaking, and he\r\nlaid the cigarette carefully down in the ashtray.\r\n\r\nWhen he comes back, thought Jeff, it\'ll be time. We\'ll have this thing\r\nout then. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
He\'s become some sort of a religious fanatic, and he doesn\'t\r\nknow it. How a man who\'s been all over hell and seen the worst sides\r\nof fifty different races in as many years can think of them all as\r\nlovable human children, I don\'t know. But, know it or not, this taking\r\nof chances has got to stop someplace; and right here is the best place\r\nof all. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
When he gets back--if he gets back, we\'re taking off. And if he\r\ndoesn\'t get back ... I\'ll blow that bloody bastard over there into so\r\nmany bits....\r\n\r\n"Coming in, Jeff," his father\'s voice on the speaker interrupted him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJeff leaned forward, his hands on the trips of the rifles; the small\r\ngrey figure suddenly shot back to the protection of the airlock,\r\nwhich snapped shut behind it. Then, he took a deep breath, stood up,\r\nand wiped the perspiration from his forehead. He went down to the\r\ninstrument room.\r\n\r\nPeter Wadley was already out of his suit and developing the pictures.\r\nJeff picked them up as they came off the roll, damp and soft to the\r\ntouch.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t tell much," he said, holding them up to the light.\r\n\r\n"There\'s a great deal of overlap," his father answered. "We\'re going\r\nto have to section and fit the pieces together like a jigsaw puzzle.\r\nWait\'ll I\'m through here."\r\n\r\nFor about five minutes more, pictures continued to come off the roll.\r\nThen Peter picked up a pair of scissors and arranged the prints in\r\ntheir proper sequence.\r\n\r\n"Clear the table," he told Jeff, "and fit these together as I hand them\r\nto you."\r\n\r\nFor a little while longer, they worked in silence. Then Peter laid down\r\nhis scissors.\r\n\r\n"That\'s all," he said. "Now, what have we got?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," answered Jeff, bewilderment in his voice. "It looks\r\nlike nothing I\'ve ever seen."\r\n\r\nPeter stepped up to the table and squinted at the shadowy films with\r\neyes practiced in reading rock formations. He shook his head.\r\n\r\n"It is strange," he said, finally.\r\n\r\n"Do you see what I see?" demanded Jeff. "There\'s no real crew\r\nspace. There\'s this one spot--up front--" he indicated it with his\r\nfinger--"that\'s about as big as a good sized closet. And nothing more\r\nthan that--except corridors about twenty inches in diameter running\r\nfrom it to points all over the ship. She must be flown by a crew of\r\nmidgets."\r\n\r\n"Midgets," echoed the older man, thoughtfully. "I never heard of an\r\nintelligent race that small."\r\n\r\n"Then they\'re something new," said Jeff, with a shrug of his shoulders.\r\n\r\n"No," said his father, slowly. "I don\'t remember when or where I heard\r\nit, but there\'s some reason why you couldn\'t have an intelligent race\r\nmuch smaller than a good sized dog. It has something to do with the\r\nfact that they grow in size as their developing intelligence gives them\r\nan increasing advantage over their environment."\r\n\r\n"Here\'s the evidence," Jeff answered, tapping the film with one finger.\r\n\r\n"No," Pete was bending over the picture fragments again. "Look at these\r\nthings in the corridor. They\'re obviously controls."\r\n\r\nJeff looked.\r\n\r\n"I see what you mean," he said at last. "If there\'s any similarity\r\nbetween their mechanical system and ours, these controls are built for\r\nsomebody pretty big. But look how they\'re scattered all over the ship.\r\nThere\'s a good fifteen or twenty different groups of instruments and\r\nother things. That means a number of crew members; and you simply can\'t\r\nput a number of large crew members in those little corridors."\r\n\r\n"There\'s a large amount of total space," Pete began. Then, suddenly a\r\nfaint tremor ran through the ship. Jeff leaped for the screen and his\r\nfather moved over to stand behind him.\r\n\r\n"Good Lord," said Jeff, "look at her."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe other ship shook suddenly and rolled slightly to one side. Some\r\nunseen center of gravity pulled her back to her original position. She\r\nhesitated a moment, and then tried again, with the same results. She\r\nlay quiescent.\r\n\r\nJeff pounced on his radiation drum graph.\r\n\r\n"What does it say?" Peter asked.\r\n\r\nJeff shook his head in astonishment. "Nothing," he answered, "just\r\nnothing at all."\r\n\r\n"Nothing?" Peter came over to take a look at the graph himself. It was\r\nas Jeff had said. The line tracing the white surface of the graph was\r\nstraight and undisturbed.\r\n\r\n"But that\'s impossible," Peter frowned.\r\n\r\nThe two men turned back to the screen. As they watched, one final\r\nshudder shook the strange ship, and then, like a stranded whale who has\r\ngiven up hope, it lay still.\r\n\r\n"My God!" said Pete, and Jeff turned to him in astonishment. It was the\r\nclosest to profanity his father had come in twenty years. "Jeff, do you\r\nknow what I think? I think that ship is manned by just one great big\r\ncreature--like a giant squid. That\'s why no radiation registered. He\r\nwas trying to move his ship by sheer strength."\r\n\r\nJeff stared at his father.\r\n\r\n"You\'re crazy," was all he could manage to say. "Why, something big\r\nenough to shake that ship would have to fill every inch of space inside\r\nit. You can\'t live in a space ship that way."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right," Pete answered. He clamped his hand on Jeff\'s shoulder\r\nexcitedly and led him back to the jigsaw puzzle on the table.\r\n\r\n"If I\'m right," he said, "that\'s no ship at all as we understand it,\r\nbut some sort of a space-going suit for something terrifically large.\r\nSomething like a giant squid, as I said, or some other long-tentacled\r\ncreature. His body would lie here--in this space you said was about the\r\nsize of a closet--and his tentacles or whatever they are, would reach\r\nout in these corridors to the various groups of instruments."\r\n\r\nJeff frowned.\r\n\r\n"It sounds sensible," he muttered. "And in any case, he wouldn\'t be\r\nable to get outside his ship to fix anything that went wrong. And I\r\ntake it there is something wrong, or else he wouldn\'t be jumping around\r\ninside."\r\n\r\n"Jeff," Pete said, "I\'m going outside to take a close look at him."\r\n\r\nJeff\'s head snapped up from the jigsaw puzzle. The old, sick fear had\r\ncome back. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
It washed over him like a wave.\r\n\r\n"Why?" he demanded harshly.\r\n\r\n"To see if I can find out what\'s wrong with his ship," said Pete over\r\nhis shoulder as he went to the airlock. "Coming?"\r\n\r\n"Wait!" 

=== Chunk 7 ===
cried Jeff. He stood up and followed his father. For a moment\r\nthere, they stood facing each other, two tall men with less apparent\r\nphysical difference between them than their ages might indicate, poised\r\non the brink of an open break.\r\n\r\n"Wait," said Jeff again, and now his voice was lower, more under\r\ncontrol. "Dad, there\'s no point in playing around any longer. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
You\r\naren\'t going to be satisfied just to look around out there and then\r\nleave. You\'re going to do something. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
And if that\'s it I want to know\r\nnow."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was a moment\'s silence; then Pete turned back to Jeff, his face\r\nset.\r\n\r\n"That\'s right," he said. "I don\'t have to look. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
I know what\'s wrong.\r\nAnd I know what I\'m going to do about it. There\'s a living intelligence\r\ntrapped in that space-thing as you and I might be trapped. I can set it\r\nfree with two of our motor jacks. If you\'ve got one inkling of what it\r\nmeans to be ignored when you\'re caught like that, you\'ll help me. If\r\nnot, I\'m taking two jacks out the airlock and you can fire the motors\r\nand take off and be damned to you."\r\n\r\nBetween the two big men the tension built and strained and broke. Jeff\r\nlet out a ragged sigh.\r\n\r\n"All right," he said. "I\'m with you."\r\n\r\n"Good," said the older man, and there was new life in his voice. "Get\r\nyour suit on. I\'ll explain as we dress."\r\n\r\n"The trouble with our friend there is that he\'s fallen over. I see you\r\ndon\'t understand, Jeff. Well, this ship of ours lands on her belly.\r\nWe\'ve got booster rockets all over the hull to correct our landing\r\nangle. But ships weren\'t always that way. They used to have to sit\r\ndown on their tail. There\'s no furrow where that ship landed, only a\r\ncircular blasted spot, so it figures. Maybe some of his mechanism went\r\nwrong at the last minute.\r\n\r\n"At any rate, I\'m betting that if we get him upright again, he can take\r\ncare of himself from there on out. So you and I are going to go out\r\nthere with a couple of jacks and see if we can\'t jack him back up into\r\nposition."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe sand was thick and heavy. The walk over to the other ship was\r\ntedious, with the heavy jacks weighing them down. They reached the\r\nalien hull, paused a moment to get their breath and then attached the\r\nmagnetic grapples to the skin of the ship at two points on opposite\r\nsides of the hull and roughly a fourth of the way up from the rocket\r\ntubes.\r\n\r\nIt was hard to anchor the jacks in the soft sand. They finally found\r\nit necessary to dig them in some three or four feet to a layer of rock\r\nthat underlay the sand. Then, when everything was ready, they took\r\ntheir stations, each at a jack, and Pete called to Jeff on the helmet\r\nset.\r\n\r\n"All ready? Start your motor."\r\n\r\nJeff reached down and flicked a switch. The tiny, powerful jack motor\r\nbegan to spin, and the jack base settled more solidly against its rocky\r\nbed. When he was sure that it would not slip, he left it, and went\r\naround the rockets to stand by his father.\r\n\r\nHis face was grey.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Pete tensely, "up she goes."\r\n\r\nThe nose of the alien ship was raising slowly from the sand. It\r\nquivered softly from some motion inside the ship.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Jeff, "up she goes." His words were flat and dull. Pete\r\nturned to look at him.\r\n\r\n"Scared, son?" he asked. Jeff\'s lips parted, closed and opened again.\r\n\r\n"You know how we stand," he said, dully. "I\'ve heard what you said from\r\nother men, but never from an alien. Most of the ones we know hit first,\r\nand talk afterward. You know that once this ship is on its feet we\'re\r\nat his mercy. Just his rocket blasts alone could kill us; and there\r\nwon\'t be time to get back to the Girl."\r\n\r\nThe alien was now at an angle of forty-five degrees. The little jacks\r\nstretched steadily, pushing their thin, stiff arms against the strange\r\nhull. Sand dripped from the rising ship.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Jeff," Pete said. "I know. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
But the important thing isn\'t what he\r\ndoes, but what we do. The fact that we\'ve helped him--can\'t you see it\r\nthat way, son?"\r\n\r\nJeff shook his head in bewilderment.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," he said helplessly. "I just don\'t know."\r\n\r\nThe ship was now nearly upright. Suddenly, with an abruptness that\r\nstartled both men, it shook itself free of the jacks and teetered free\r\nfor a second, before coming to rest, its nose pointing straight up.\r\n\r\n"Here it goes," said Pete, a tinge of excitement in his voice. They\r\nmoved back some yards to be out of the way of the takeoff blast.\r\nSuddenly the ground trembled under their feet. Pete put his hand on the\r\nyounger man\'s shoulder.\r\n\r\n"Here it goes," he repeated, in a whisper.\r\n\r\nFlame burst abruptly from the base of the ship. It was warming up its\r\ntubes. Slowly the flame puffed out from its base and it began to rise.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJeff shook suddenly with an uncontrollable shudder. His voice came to\r\nPete through the earphones, starkly afraid.\r\n\r\n"Now what?" he cried. "What\'ll he do now?"\r\n\r\nPete\'s grip tightened on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n"Steady boy."\r\n\r\nThe ship was rising. Up it went, and up, until it was the size of a\r\nman\'s little finger, a tiny sliver of silver against the black backdrop\r\nof the sky. Then, inexplicably, it halted and began to reverse itself.\r\n\r\nSlowly it turned, until the blunt nose pointed toward them. Jeff\'s\r\nhoarse breathing was loud in his helmet. _Now it comes_, he thought,\r\nand his muscles tensed.\r\n\r\nA long minute flowed by and still the alien hung there. Then, abruptly\r\nit went into a series of idiotic gyrations; it twisted and turned, and\r\nspun around, swinging its fiery trail of rocket gases like a luminous\r\ntail in the darkness. Then, just as abruptly, it reversed once more,\r\nso that its head was away from them; in the twinkling of a moment it\r\nwas gone.\r\n\r\nPete sighed, a deep, ragged sigh.\r\n\r\n"Did you see it, boy?" he cried. "Did you see it?"\r\n\r\n"I saw," Jeff\'s voice was filled with a new awe. "Now I get it. He\r\nwasn\'t sure--he didn\'t know we were really trying to help him until we\r\nlet him get all the way out there by himself. Then he knew he was free.\r\nThat\'s why he wouldn\'t answer before."\r\n\r\n"Sure, Jeff, sure," said the older man, a note of triumph in his voice.\r\n"But that\'s not what I mean. Did you notice all those contortions he\r\nwas going through up there? What did they remind you of?"\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of silence, then the words came, at first slowly,\r\nthen in a rush from Jeff\'s lips.\r\n\r\n"Like a puppy," he said, haltingly, stumbling over the wonder of it.\r\n"Like a puppy wagging its tail."\r\n\r\nAnd the light of a new understanding broke suddenly in his eyes.\r\n\r\n"Dad!" said Jeff, turning to his father. "Dad! 

=== Chunk 12 ===
Do you know what I\r\nthink? 

=== Chunk 13 ===
I think we\'ve made a friend."\r\n\r\nAnd the two men stood there, side by side, looking into the blackness\r\nof space where an odd-shaped spacecraft had vanished. It, they felt,\r\nwas on its way home.\r\n\r\nAnd they were right. Moreover, It was hurrying.\r\n\r\nFor It had a story to tell.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
