The awful goad of the Terror is gone and\r\nmen can look into the sky without fear. The new colonies thrive among\r\nthe low red hills of Mars, in the icy moraines of Io, Europa, and\r\nTitan. Starships are poised on the outer moons; perhaps soon Earth will\r\nwear a diadem of stars.\r\n\r\nYet some of the bitterness of the fear-ridden years is with us\r\nstill. Forgiveness does not come easily to those who have suffered\r\nthe humiliation of the Terror; there are the blighted lives to\r\nremember, and the unfortunates who lived and died under the threat of\r\nannihilation from the sky. Jan Carvel\'s memory is accursed--for it was\r\nCarvel who brought the Terror.\r\n\r\nOf the man himself, little is known. He lived--and died--in the\r\nfirst decade of the Conquest of Space, or in the last decade of the\r\nNationalist Era, since they coincide. A few short years had passed\r\nsince the first successful Moon flights and the establishment of the\r\nSpace Stations, and the tensions that had been mounting among the\r\nnations of Earth were nearing the breaking point.\r\n\r\nLunaris was \'Moon Base\' then, and the launching racks were pointed back\r\ntoward Earth and not toward the planets. Intense activity had turned\r\nthe Moon into an atomic arsenal--a focal point of all the destructive\r\narts men had learned during and since the Second World War.\r\n\r\nThe Old Countries, mainly the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and\r\nthe United States of America, stood with weapons poised; the seemingly\r\neternal Cold War steadily growing hotter. Moon Base was American, and\r\nthe Space Stations were Russian; a parity of weapons had been reached\r\nand jingoists cried for war.\r\n\r\nHistory does not record the exact date of Jan Carvel\'s departure from\r\nthe Earth-Moon System. It is known that he was an American, a qualified\r\nMoon pilot, and a fanatic on the subject of planetary exploration. It\r\nis also known that he boarded an experimental long range rocket-bomber\r\nwithout authorization and vanished from the arsenal in Tycho. Some\r\nhave suggested that he did not steal the craft and that he was\r\nactually ordered on his epoch-making flight, presumably in search of\r\nmilitarily useful information. This is unlikely. Having reached the\r\nMoon and turned it into fortress, the United States lost interest in\r\nspace travel. Carvel chafed under the restraints placed upon him and\r\nthe Bureau of Security; it is therefore more than just probable that\r\nhe took it upon himself to press the cause of exploration without\r\nauthority or sanction.\r\n\r\nThe result of this irresponsible course of action was predestined.\r\nCarvel lost his ship and his life. But he left a legacy that was to\r\nshake the world.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the evening of January 17, 1971, some six years after Carvel\'s\r\ndisappearance from Moon Base, the Pacific Radar Watch detected an\r\napproaching missile. It was tracked for routine interception, and one\r\nGround to Air Missile was actually launched at it before its erratic\r\ncourse identified the unknown rocket as a space-craft in distress.\r\nFortunately, the GTA Missile was caught and neutralized before\r\ninterception occurred, and the approaching space-craft was allowed to\r\ncrash in the middle of California\'s Central Valley near what was then\r\nthe city of Fresno.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Jan Carvel\'s ship crashed and burned when he came\r\nback....]\r\n\r\nSearch crews found the wreckage and it was immediately established as\r\nthe experimental rocket-bomber stolen six years before by Jan Carvel.\r\nIt was badly smashed by the crash, and in addition seemed to have\r\nsustained a considerable amount of battle damage.\r\n\r\nA charred body was removed from the rocket and identified as Jan\r\nCarvel. The craft\'s papers, however, were in an excellent state of\r\npreservation, it being indicated that Carvel sacrificed his life to\r\nprotect them. These papers, consisting of some photographs, some\r\ncrudely drawn planetary maps, and a diary, were contained in a steel\r\nbox addressed to the Secretary of Defense. They were rushed to\r\nthis official without delay, fortunately he was at the time in New\r\nWashington, somewhere under the Great Lakes.\r\n\r\nWithin twelve hours, a meeting was held among the Chiefs of State of\r\nall the Western Powers. Two hours later, a special courier-plane was\r\ndispatched to Kuibishev, the new Russian capital beyond the Urals, and\r\nthe greatest joint effort in the history of mankind was begun. The\r\nTerror had come to Earth....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_From the text of the President of the United States\' message to\r\nMarshal Vasili Kemprov, the Russian Dictator._\r\n\r\n"... in spite of our differences. Therefore, I urgently request that\r\nyou personally authorize the dispatching of qualified Russian experts\r\nto join in the scientific council now convening here to evaluate these\r\nterrifying documents.\r\n\r\n"If you desire, hostages may be exchanged to assure the safety of your\r\npersonnel...."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_From the Carvel Diary._\r\n\r\nI stood on the thin snowdrifts and looked westward, into the setting\r\nsun. The vastness of the silent desert was red with faintly visible\r\nplumes of sand that rode high on the icy air. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
Above me, the sky was\r\ncobalt and the stars shone bright and unwinking. The nearer moon rode\r\nlow on the horizon, almost touching the tiny disk of the sun. I was\r\nalone, as I have been since leaving Earth. Nowhere on this world is\r\nthere life, but here men might live and thrive, for there is beauty and\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n_Later._ I have found a rich vein of uranium ore. The ship\'s converter\r\nwill serve to refine it. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
I can go on. When I return, I will build a\r\ncairn, to prove that one man, at least, was sane.\r\n\r\n_Later._ The landing was difficult, for the heat of the rocket-blast\r\nvolatilized the frozen methane under me. As I let her settle, the ship\r\ndug a pit in the glacier and now she lies half buried in the yellowish\r\nice.\r\n\r\nI slept and fed myself and put on a pressure suit. Outside, the cold\r\nand the black sky pressed in on me, making me afraid. It is never dark\r\nhere, for the planet fills the sky like a bloated yellow balloon. In\r\nthe far distance, I can see a fault in the glacier, and the black rock\r\nof this moonlet shows through. I think there is silver in the rock. It\r\nstreaks it in a pattern of filigree.\r\n\r\nThere is little here but the challenge of keeping alive. The cold\r\ndepresses me and the giant in the sky fills me with vertigo. I shall go\r\non.\r\n\r\n_Later._ A giant ahead and a giant behind. The blackness of space is\r\nall around me, and I grow used to it. I sleep and eat little now and\r\nweightlessness is beginning to sicken me. I have come a long way.\r\n\r\nThe system ahead shows promise.\r\n\r\n_Later._ I landed the ship on a wide plain. Rubble is everywhere.\r\nPerhaps this was once a moraine, but even the glacier is gone now. In\r\nthe light of the sun I can see a rising fault like a palisade. Some low\r\nhills and a talus flank it. Bright colors are sparkling there. I think\r\nthe cliff is thick with gem deposits.\r\n\r\n_Later._ I do not like to leave this moonlet. It is small and friendly.\r\nThe air is thin, but it makes the sky blue and not black and that makes\r\nme think of Earth. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Perhaps I should be thinking of going back. The fuel\r\nis getting low and the air in the ship is fouling. It will take a long\r\ntime to reach home.\r\n\r\n_Later._ I will go on for a little while longer. I cannot help thinking\r\nthat I will be the only one of my race to ever see these worlds. It\r\nis a godlike thought, but sad. At home there is nothing but hate and\r\nthoughts of killing. A great pity. The sky could be ours, if we were\r\nunited.\r\n\r\n_Later._ God have mercy on me! I have seen the face of doom! The great\r\ncratered plain that spread out below me was lined with ships. Great\r\ntowering machines of war. We have waited too long, and now _they_ have\r\ncome!\r\n\r\nI am a soldier. A bad one, but still a soldier, I know the look of an\r\ninvasion base when I see one. This is what I have seen. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
I will take\r\npictures. I must return and warn them at home. They have so little time\r\nto prepare.\r\n\r\nWhere have they come from? From the stars? They do not belong here.\r\nThis tiny moonlet never gave them birth. Then whence have they come?\r\nAnd why? _I am afraid...._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_From the report of the UN Psychometric Evaluation Board._\r\n\r\n"Careful study of the Carvel Diary indicates that it is in fact\r\nauthentic. Apparently, the loneliness of a protracted deep-space\r\nflight shattered his mind, but his observations are in no wise to be\r\ndisregarded for this reason. It is highly possible that the \'invasion\r\nbase\' was the culminating cause rather than the _effect_ of Carvel\'s\r\nobvious psychosis. Further investigation is most definitely called for.

Colonization may\r\nbe the answer.\r\n\r\n"Nowhere have the UN patrols discovered any indications of previous\r\noccupation by alien forces. Nothing resembling the invasion fleet\r\ndiscovered by Jan Carvel has been located. However, the cairn mentioned\r\nin the Diary has been found, further supporting the authenticity of\r\nthat document...."\r\n\r\n_Addendum in manuscript._\r\n\r\n"Higashi suggests that the message found in the Cairn confirms the\r\noriginal findings of the UN Psychometric Evaluation Board concerning\r\nJan Carvel\'s sanity."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_From the message found written in pencil on a shipping tag in the\r\nMartian Cairn built by Jan Carvel._\r\n\r\n"Welcome, my brothers!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_From the Founding Directive of the New UN Planetary Colonization and\r\nDevelopment Committee._\r\n\r\n"It being established that Mars and Europa are free of alien\r\noccupation, colonization of the areas immediately surrounding the UN\r\nMilitary and Scientific Bases on these planets immediately begun...."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_From the statement of Delegate L.

He must have been quite a natural\r\npsychologist himself, you know? He understood that people at home would\r\njust be looking for an excuse to abandon their suicidal hysteria. What\r\nhe gave them was a common enemy. Had a lot of courage, too. Must have\r\nshot up his own ship and then wrecked himself deliberately, leaving the\r\npapers and the trail of Cairns.\r\n\r\n"People will hate him when they find that he made fools of them, but\r\nI don\'t think they\'ll go back to the old life of before the \'Terror.\'\r\nThey will find out, of course.
