He was an example to any\r\nothers, in the year of twenty-two hundred A.D., who would strive to\r\nrule the solar system. The planets were independent states and they\r\nwere to remain that way. For trying to change this, Kemble had been\r\nexiled to unexplored Pluto.\r\n\r\nMarcius raised his mailed fist toward the mighty stars and ground out\r\ncurses against Earth and all those upon it, wishing that he could call\r\nupon it the wrath of Heaven and Hell, for it had been the men of Earth\r\nwho had brought about his ultimate downfall.\r\n\r\nIt had been the age-old story of a power-mad tyrant finding out the\r\nsecret grudges of his subjects and working on them to inspire a frenzy\r\nof hate, to maneuver them into a war against unsuspecting neighboring\r\nnations. He had gained control of the whole of Mars in this way and had\r\nbeen reaching out for the moon-system of Saturn, when the full force of\r\nthe Planetary Combine had come against him, scattering his forces.\r\n\r\nThe counter offensive had been led by Earth, and it had been an Earth\r\nship which, after his short-lived escape, had parachuted him to the\r\ncold surface of Pluto. Is it any wonder that he should hate them?\r\n\r\nMarcius Kemble looked fearfully around at the bleak, frozen landscape\r\nof Pluto, a cold Hell, hardly reached by the light of the sun. Then he\r\nbegan to laugh.\r\n\r\nMarcius laughed into the little plastic world of his helmet and the\r\nsound roared back into his own ears, and he laughed louder. Tears\r\nstreamed down over the contact lenses in his eyes and caused the white\r\nmountains to gesticulate and beckon to him.\r\n\r\nHe was beginning to see it all very clearly now. It wasn\'t his own\r\nlaughter in his helmet. The white mountains were laughing at him, the\r\nstars and sun were laughing, and all the people of all the planets. It\r\nwas all concentrated into his ears by the curve of his helmet.\r\n\r\nThey were spying on him to see what he would do, laughing because he\r\ncould do nothing, their voices filling his head, asking who he was,\r\nwhat he was going to do now, mocking him. He would show them! Run to\r\nthe laughing white mountains, cast them into an ocean, crush them\r\nbeneath his feet! That would put them in their places! Do it now!\r\n\r\nMarcius pulled himself to his feet. He knew that he had been running\r\nand had fallen, striking his helmet upon something hard, and that\r\nhe had been laughing, crying and cursing at the same time. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
The\r\nreverberating blow had shocked him into silence. And he was remembering\r\nthe words of the doctor who had cared for him, back on Mars.\r\n\r\nThe doctor had said, "You have a great mind, Sire, and a very strong\r\nwill, but there are some flaws, as in all men. If you should know\r\ndefeat, your only hope will be death. Living, your mind would refuse to\r\ngive up, beating itself into insanity against a blank wall."\r\n\r\nNow, Marcius knew what the doctor had meant. There were still the\r\nvoices in his mind repeating over and over, "Who are you?--Who are\r\nyou?" almost as if they were mocking the beating of his heart.\r\n\r\nThere was something strange about the voices, Marcius thought. It was\r\nas if there were some alien intelligence behind them. There were two\r\nof them, and they seemed to require an answer from him. It was with no\r\ngreat hope that he answered the voices by concentrating upon his name\r\nand present predicament.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe thoughts of Marcius Kemble did not go unheard. Unknown to the\r\nrest of the solar system, Pluto had its inhabitants. To Earth men,\r\nthese would be very strange beings, not alone in appearance but in\r\ncomposition. Their heads were roughly triangular, widening upward from\r\na pointed chin and resting on thin, yet strong, necks above equally\r\nstrong and spindly man-like bodies. They were mainly composed of\r\nelements which became solid only at very low temperatures.\r\n\r\nThus it was that one of these beings sat before a radio-like device and\r\nperspired in the extreme cold of the room. His long pointed ears were\r\ndepressed by the weight of a shiny metal cap and his too-large eyes\r\nheld a look of worried consternation. The reason for his consternation\r\nwas the thoughts of the ex-dictator of Mars.\r\n\r\nThe wearer of the cap shot a series of rapid sounds at the other\r\noccupant of the room.\r\n\r\nHe said, in effect, "I have received thought emanations from the\r\ndirection of the great plain, rather garbled. The being is probably\r\na giant from some other world, for his thoughts are alien and he\r\nevidently considers it within his power to crush the mountains which\r\nhouse us!"\r\n\r\nThe other made a negative gesture with a slender hand. "Don\'t you think\r\nit is more likely that it is a trick of the enemy to frighten us, Gor?\r\nThey have tried such things before, you know."\r\n\r\nGor was quiet while he peered into the eyepiece of an instrument; then\r\nhe replied, "We will soon know. Tower Three has made contact, giving us\r\nthe exact location, and the inquisitors have now gone to work on him."\r\n\r\nFor a while, the two Plutonians busied themselves with their various\r\nmachines, then Gor spoke again. "You are radiating sorrow, Bakar. What\r\ntroubles you?

=== Chunk 4 ===
"\r\n\r\nBakar sighed. "I was thinking of the ancient pictures of Ahndee in the\r\ndays when its orbit was much nearer the sun, and we, the inhabitants\r\nof Ahndee, were happy in our beautiful cities.\r\n\r\n"Now, the two remaining great nations hide, one from the other, beneath\r\nthe mountains, and neither can break the defenses of the other, but\r\nstill we try. What is the use of it?

=== Chunk 5 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Careful, Bakar," Gor looked sternly at the other. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
"The Four may have\r\nyou in the thought beam. You know that The Four lead us along this path\r\nbecause it is the only choice, the path shown in the future machine.\r\n\r\n"In the time you speak of," Gor went on, "the people were no better off\r\nthan we of today. Because they did not have the future machine, they\r\nhad failures. They wandered from the way and their failures turned them\r\nback to the course provided by the natural law. Now we know for what we\r\nare bound and, if we work toward that end, can know no failures."\r\n\r\nA strange light came into Bakar\'s eyes, but he said nothing.\r\n\r\nShortly thereafter, a voice drifted into the room. It was a mild voice,\r\nbut it was also old and wise.\r\n\r\nThe voice said, "This is Nel, one of The Four. The being on the plain\r\nhas been probed and analyzed and has been found to be a creature of the\r\ncarbon class from the inner worlds. He has sought to deceive us in the\r\nmanner in which he has deceived his own, but we have seen all.\r\n\r\n"The being is of a race called man and is named Mah Shuss Kem Bil. He\r\nis clothed in a type of space armour which embodies an air purifier,\r\ngood for a period of time long enough to transport him to the fourth\r\nplanet at half the speed of light, and is protected against cold by\r\nelectric and tonic stimulants which do not produce heat, but only\r\nsuspend the sensation of cold. Therefore we may come in contact with\r\nhim without fear of burns.\r\n\r\n"Since the future machine indicates that he must be sent back into\r\nspace, and since there is no place for him in our world, he will be\r\ndisposed of at once. Tower Two will dispatch two ships. The man will be\r\ninstructed in the operation of one of the ships and sent on his way.\r\nThe pilots will return in the other ship. That is all."\r\n\r\nFor a long moment, quiet filled the room.\r\n\r\nGor was uneasy as he said, "Well, Bakar, have you not heard? It is your\r\nduty to dispatch the ships. Why do you hesitate?"\r\n\r\nBakar sprung to his feet, a small weapon clutched in his claw-like\r\nhand. "No!" he hissed, "I will not obey the machine. I am going to\r\nprove to you, and to all, that it can be wrong. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
You know of the soft\r\nplaces in the plain, Gor. It is a wonder that the man did not land\r\nin one of these, considering that there are more of these than solid\r\nground. But he will weary of waiting for the ships, which he has\r\nbeen informed of, and begin to wander. He cannot go far before he is\r\nswallowed up, sinking deeper and deeper. Then we shall see if the\r\nfuture machine is always right!"\r\n\r\nGor said nothing, but a slight smile came to his lips, a rather ironic\r\none.\r\n\r\nIt was much later when Gor again spoke. He turned from his position\r\nat the thought receiver and said, "News for you, Bakar. I have just\r\nreceived thought that the man is on his way."\r\n\r\nBakar visibly started, and Gor continued, "How many times have you\r\ncomplied with an order from The Four and pressed the button that\r\ninforms second in command that you had done so? Force of habit caused\r\nyou to perform it this time, Bakar. The order went on, through second\r\nin command."\r\n\r\nHe added softly, "The future machine never lies!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMarcius Kemble stood upon the frozen plain and waited. A satanic smile\r\nlighted his face and the cry for revenge was in his heart. He somehow\r\nfelt that the thoughts had not lied, that they would send the promised\r\nship. Then he would be free again, blasting back to quench his thirst\r\nfor revenge against the Combine. His face became flushed and the\r\ntemperature within his suit became perceptibly greater, as he formed\r\nhis fanatical plans. While he waited, the leaders of the Combine, in\r\nhis mind, suffered and died a thousand times.\r\n\r\nThe coming of the ships was swift. One moment there was nothing; the\r\nnext, they rested upon the plain before him. Marcius was surprised to\r\nnote that they were very small, as compared to others he had seen. So\r\nmuch the better, he thought, to elude the space patrol.\r\n\r\nHe also marveled at the fact that the creatures coming toward him from\r\nthe ships were lightly clothed, and that they could speak to him\r\nthrough his mind.\r\n\r\n"Do not fear us," came the thought. "You must come with us into one of\r\nthe craft, to learn of the controls."\r\n\r\nInside the ship, Marcius found that "learning of the controls" was much\r\nsimpler than he had thought it would be.\r\n\r\nHe sat in the pilot\'s seat, hands on the controls and eyes closed. A\r\nthousand times more effective than words, thoughts came to him, and he\r\nflew the Plutonian ship through every condition and position that could\r\never be encountered, even though he never left the place at which the\r\nship had come to rest on the plain. Mental instruction.\r\n\r\nIt all ended with Marcius Kemble, condemned dictator of Mars, soaring\r\naway from Pluto forever, still enclosed in his space suit because the\r\nair within the ship was never meant for the lungs of men, and heading\r\ntoward earth, toward the fulfillment of his evil plans.\r\n\r\nAs the atmosphere of Pluto fell away behind him, Marcius wondered that\r\nhe felt no acceleration. Then he remembered a faint something which\r\nhe had detected in the thoughts of his instructor, something about\r\nincreased momentum being induced into each individual atom, so that\r\neach retained its normal position to that of every other.\r\n\r\nBut Marcius was not the kind to spend much time on thinking of such\r\ncomplicated matters. Instead, he lapsed into an ecstasy of evil dreams,\r\ndreams in which he was again the mighty monarch, this time of Earth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs the little ship drove on through space, Marcius pictured himself\r\nwalking in on the members of the Council--he would have gained his\r\nrightful place as ruler by then, of course--and chuckled at the\r\nexpressions he imagined on their faces, mouths hanging open, eyes many\r\ntimes too large, and their heads hanging nearly to their belts.\r\n\r\nSomeone was kneeling before him. It was the Martian member and his eyes\r\nwere tightly closed against the stinging tears while his thin hands\r\nwere clasped before him, praying to Marcius to have mercy.\r\n\r\nMarcius was about to order them strung end to end and dangled, for the\r\nrest of their lives from an over-hanging cliff, when he became aware\r\nof his present surroundings with a start. Time to start decelerating.\r\n\r\nSighing, he reached for the proper lever and pulled it back.\r\n\r\nFor a moment, nothing happened. Then the ship seemed to shake itself\r\nand Marcius was half lifted from his seat. It couldn\'t be! The\r\ndecelerating force should act equally on his body and the ship. How,\r\nthen, could he be thrown forward?\r\n\r\nSomething bumped lightly against his helmet and drifted on by. Only\r\nfor a moment did he stare blankly at the little silvery sphere, then\r\nthe nose of the ship came away with a weird plopping hiss, and he was\r\njerked through the opening by the force of the escaping air.\r\n\r\nIn confusion, he tried to swing his body around so that he could see\r\nwhat had happened. He twisted his shoulders around, but his hips turned\r\nequally in an opposite direction. To halt one meant to halt the other.\r\nHe tried kicking his legs back hard, but only succeeded in arching\r\nhis body and wrenching his back. Desperately, he began kicking and\r\nsquirming like a mad dancer. Each motion depended upon an equal and\r\nopposite motion of his body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _He began kicking and squirming like a mad dancer._]\r\n\r\nIn the midst of his struggles, his heel struck on something and started\r\nhim spinning, head over heels. It was the ship. The combined gravities\r\nof the ship and his own body had brought them together again, and he\r\nwas revolving about the heavier object in a close orbit, and he was\r\nturning end for end, now.\r\n\r\nMarcius could not feel the motion. It seemed as if the universe were\r\nturning about his stationary body, rising at his head and setting at\r\nhis feet.\r\n\r\nHe saw the ship then, but it was no longer a ship. It dawned on him why\r\nthe Plutonians had never ventured much nearer the sun, and why, after\r\nthey had known all about him, they had let him go.\r\n\r\nReceding from him, was a perfect sphere of liquid mercury, once the\r\nhard hull of a space ship, covered with a thin layer of water that had\r\nonce been windows, with small pieces of solid material floating on the\r\nsurface. It was only a natural law that it should revert to this form\r\nwhen deprived of the sub-temperatures of Pluto.\r\n\r\nYes, Marcius Kemble saw it all now, but too late. He remembered a\r\ndemonstration he had seen when a child. A man had poured mercury into\r\na mold and cooled it to near absolute zero. When withdrawn from the\r\nmold, it had been a little bell that gave a clear tone.\r\n\r\nWhy hadn\'t he thought of it before? The cold bodies of the Plutonians\r\nenabled them to handle such metals as he would handle steel! They made\r\ntheir ships and machines of such things as mercury and ice, and perhaps\r\na few materials unknown to man, but all of a low melting point. Why\r\nshould they do otherwise, when the extreme cold of Pluto made those\r\nthings as hard as steel? It was even doubtful if they could produce\r\nenough heat to melt steel or even glass, or if they could produce a\r\nsubstance able to retain such fires.\r\n\r\nA hot rage began to boil within him. The Plutonians had known it all\r\nalong! With their science they could have kept him alive until they had\r\nlearned how to build a ship that would not melt from the heat of the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nNow, Marcius Kemble\'s unretarded speed carried him through the orbit of\r\nthe earth while it was still many thousands of miles distant. He began\r\nto feel the boiling heat of the sun and realized what it would be like\r\nwhen the insulation of his space suit gave way to that awful heat, but\r\nhe decided that he would never live to suffer it. Better to let the\r\nvacuum of space draw his life from him quickly and painlessly.\r\n\r\nSlowly, he reached up to unscrew his helmet. He gave it a slight tug,\r\nthen twisted with all his might. The helmet did not budge. For a moment\r\nhe could not think clearly. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
Then it came to him. The air pressure\r\nwithin the suit was so great, in relation to the vacuum of space, that\r\nit bound the threads together with a friction that he could never hope\r\nto overcome!\r\n\r\nWith fear-filled eyes, he watched the hot disk of the sun expand around\r\nhim as he fell toward it.\r\n\r\nThe system would soon be rid of Marcius Kemble.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
