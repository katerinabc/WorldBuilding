Well, maybe\r\n it\'s _not_ an insult; it might be a pet name.\r\n Ah--but _whose_ pet name?_\r\n\r\n\r\n_WEAK_ ON SQUARE ROOTS\r\n\r\n_By Russell Burton_\r\n\r\nIllustrated by TOM BEECHAM\r\n\r\n\r\nAs his coach sped through dusk-darkened Jersey meadows, Ronald Lovegear,\r\nfourteen years with Allied Electronix, embraced his burden with both\r\narms, silently cursing the engineer who was deliberately rocking the\r\ntrain. In his thin chest he nursed the conviction that someday there\r\nwould be an intelligent robot at the throttle of the 5:10 to\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\nHe carefully moved one hand and took a notebook from his pocket. That\r\nwould be a good thing to mention at the office next Monday.\r\n\r\nAgain he congratulated himself for having induced his superiors to let\r\nhim take home the company\'s most highly developed mechanism to date. He\r\nhad already forgiven himself for the little white lie that morning.\r\n\r\n"Pascal," he had told them, "is a little weak on square roots." That had\r\ndone it!\r\n\r\nOld Hardwick would never permit an Allied computer to hit the market\r\nthat was not the absolute master of square roots. If Lovegear wanted to\r\nwork on Pascal on his own time it was fine with the boss.\r\n\r\nRonald Lovegear consulted his watch. He wondered if his wife would be on\r\ntime. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
He had told Corinne twice over the phone to bring the station\r\nwagon to meet him. But she had been so forgetful lately. It was probably\r\nthe new house; six rooms to keep up without a maid was quite a chore.\r\nHis pale eyes blinked. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
He had a few ideas along that line too. He smiled\r\nand gave the crate a gentle pat.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCorinne was at the station, and she had brought the station wagon.\r\nLovegear managed to get the crate to the stairs of the coach where he\r\nconsented to the assistance of a porter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"It\'s not really heavy," he told Corinne as he and the porter waddled\r\nthrough the crowd. "Actually only 57 pounds, four ounces. Aluminum\r\ncasing, you know ..."\r\n\r\n"No, I didn\'t ..." began Corinne.\r\n\r\n"But it\'s delicate," he continued. "If I should drop this ..." He\r\nshuddered.\r\n\r\nAfter the crate had been placed lengthwise in the rear of the station\r\nwagon, Corinne watched Ronald tuck a blanket around it.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not very cold, Ronald."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want it to get bounced around," he said. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
"Now, please, Corinne,\r\ndo drive carefully." Not until she had driven half a block did he kiss\r\nher on the cheek. Then he glanced anxiously over his shoulder at the\r\nrear seat. Once he thought Corinne hit a rut that could have been\r\navoided.\r\n\r\nLong after Corinne had retired that night she heard Ronald pounding with\r\na brass hammer down in his den. At first she had insisted he take the\r\ncrate out to his workshop. He looked at her with scientific aloofness\r\nand asked if she had the slightest conception of what "this is worth?"\r\nShe hadn\'t, and she went to bed. It was only another one of his gestures\r\nwhich was responsible for these weird dreams. That night she dreamed\r\nRonald brought home a giant octopus which insisted on doing the dishes\r\nfor her. In the morning she woke up feeling unwanted.\r\n\r\nDownstairs Ronald had already put on the coffee. He was wearing his robe\r\nand the pinched greyness of his face told Corinne he had been up half\r\nthe night. He poured coffee for her, smiling wanly. "If I have any\r\ncommitments today, Corinne, will you please see that they are taken care\r\nof?"\r\n\r\n"But you were supposed to get the wallpaper for the guest room...."\r\n\r\n"I know, I know, dear. But time is so short. They might want Pascal\r\nback any day. For the next week or two I shall want to devote most of\r\nmy time ..."\r\n\r\n"_Pascal?_"\r\n\r\n"Yes. The machine--the computer." He smiled at her ignorance. "We\r\nusually name the expensive jobs. You see, a computer of this nature is\r\nreally the heart and soul of the mechanical man we will construct."\r\n\r\nCorinne didn\'t see, but in a few minutes she strolled toward the den,\r\nbalancing her coffee in both hands. With one elbow she eased the door\r\nopen. There it was: an innocent polished cabinet reaching up to her\r\nshoulders. Ronald had removed one of the plates from its side and she\r\npeeped into the section where the heart and soul might be located. She\r\nsaw only an unanatomical array of vacuum tubes and electrical relays.\r\n\r\nShe felt Ronald at her back. "It looks like the inside of a juke box,"\r\nshe said.\r\n\r\nHe beamed. "The same relay systems used in the simple juke box are\r\nincorporated in a computer." He placed one hand lovingly on the top of\r\nthe cabinet.\r\n\r\n"But, Ronald--it doesn\'t even resemble a--a mechanical man?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s because it doesn\'t have any appendages as yet. You know, arms\r\nand legs. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
That\'s a relatively simple adjustment." He winked at Corinne\r\nwith a great air of complicity. "And I have some excellent ideas along\r\nthat line. Now, run along, because I\'ll be busy most of the day."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCorinne ran along. She spent most of the day shopping for week-end\r\nnecessities. On an irrational last-minute impulse--perhaps an\r\nunconscious surrender to the machine age--she dug in the grocery deep\r\nfreeze and brought out a couple of purple steaks.\r\n\r\nThat evening she had to call Ronald three times for dinner, and when he\r\ncame out of the den she noticed that he closed the door the way one does\r\nupon a small child. He chattered about inconsequential matters all\r\nthrough dinner. Corinne knew that his work was going smoothly. A few\r\nminutes later she was to know how smoothly.\r\n\r\nIt started when she began to put on her apron to do the dishes. "Let\r\nthat go for now, dear," Ronald said, taking the apron from her. He went\r\ninto the den, returning with a small black box covered with push\r\nbuttons. "Now observe carefully," he said, his voice pitched high.\r\n\r\nHe pushed one of the buttons, waited a second with his ear cocked toward\r\nthe den, then pushed another.\r\n\r\nCorinne heard the turning of metal against metal, and she slowly turned\r\nher head.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" She suppressed a shriek, clutching Ronald\'s arm so tightly he\r\nalmost dropped the control box.\r\n\r\nPascal was walking under his own effort, considerably taller now with\r\nthe round, aluminum legs Ronald had given him. Two metal arms also hung\r\nat the sides of the cabinet. One of these rose stiffly, as though for\r\nbalance. Corinne\'s mouth opened as she watched the creature jerk\r\nawkwardly across the living room.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Ronald! The fishbowl!"\r\n\r\nRonald stabbed knowingly at several buttons.\r\n\r\nPascal pivoted toward them, but not before his right arm swung out and,\r\nalmost contemptuously, brushed the fishbowl to the floor.\r\n\r\nCorinne closed her eyes at the crash. Then she scooped up several little\r\ngolden bodies and rushed for the kitchen. When she returned Ronald was\r\npicking up pieces of glass and dabbing at the pool of water with one of\r\nher bathroom towels. Pascal, magnificently aloof, was standing in the\r\ncenter of the mess.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry." Ronald looked up. "It was my fault. I got confused on the\r\nbuttons."\r\n\r\nBut Corinne\'s glances toward the rigid Pascal held no indictment. She\r\nwas only mystified. There was something wrong here.\r\n\r\n"But Ronald, he\'s so ugly without a head. I thought that all robots--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," he explained, "we would put heads on them for display purposes\r\nonly. Admittedly that captures the imagination of the public. That\r\nlittle adapter shaft at the top could be the neck, of course...."\r\n\r\nHe waved Corinne aside and continued his experiments with the home-made\r\nrobot. Pascal moved in controlled spasms around the living room. Once,\r\nhe walked just a little too close to the floor-length window--and\r\nCorinne stood up nervously. But Ronald apparently had mastered the\r\nlittle black box.\r\n\r\nWith complete confidence Corinne went into the kitchen to do the dishes.\r\nNot until she was elbow deep in suds did she recall her dreams about the\r\noctopus. She looked over her shoulder, and the curious, unwanted feeling\r\ncame again.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following afternoon--after Ronald had cancelled their Sunday drive\r\ninto the country--Pascal, with constant exhortations by Ronald at the\r\nblack box, succeeded in vacuum cleaning the entire living room. Ronald\r\nwas ecstatic.\r\n\r\n"Now do you understand?" he asked Corinne. "A mechanical servant! 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Think\r\nof it! Of course mass production may be years away, but ..."\r\n\r\n"Everyone will have Thursday nights off," said Corinne--but Ronald was\r\nalready jabbing at buttons as Pascal dragged the vacuum cleaner back to\r\nits niche in the closet.\r\n\r\nLater, Corinne persuaded Ronald to take her to a movie, but not until\r\nthe last moment was she certain that Pascal wasn\'t going to drag along.\r\n\r\nEvery afternoon of the following week Ronald Lovegear called from the\r\nlaboratory in New York to ask how Pascal was getting along.\r\n\r\n"Just fine," Corinne told him on Thursday afternoon. "But he certainly\r\nruined some of the tomato plants in the garden. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
He just doesn\'t seem to\r\nhoe in a straight line. Are you certain it\'s the green button I push?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s probably one of the pressure regulators," interrupted Ronald.\r\n"I\'ll check it when I get home." Corinne suspected by his lowered voice\r\nthat Mr. Hardwick had walked into the lab.\r\n\r\nThat night Pascal successfully washed and dried the dishes, cracking\r\nonly one cup in the process. Corinne spent the rest of the evening\r\nsitting in the far corner of the living room, thumbing the pages of a\r\nmagazine.\r\n\r\nOn the following afternoon--prompted perhaps by that perverse female\r\ntrait which demands completion of all projects once started--Corinne\r\nlingered for several minutes in the vegetable department at the grocery.\r\nShe finally picked out a fresh, round and blushing pumpkin.\r\n\r\nLater in her kitchen, humming a little tune under her breath, Corinne\r\ndeftly maneuvered a paring knife to transform the pumpkin into a very\r\nreasonable facsimile of a man\'s head. She placed the pumpkin over the\r\ntiny shaft between Pascal\'s box-shaped shoulders and stepped back.\r\n\r\nShe smiled at the moon-faced idiot grinning back at her. He was\r\ncomplete, and not bad-looking! But just before she touched the red\r\nbutton once and the blue button twice--which sent Pascal stumbling out\r\nto the backyard to finish weeding the circle of pansies before\r\ndinner--she wondered about the gash that was his mouth. She distinctly\r\nremembered carving it so that the ends curved upward into a frozen and\r\nquite harmless smile. But one end of the toothless grin seemed to sag a\r\nlittle, like the cynical smile of one who knows his powers have been\r\nunderestimated.\r\n\r\nCorinne would not have had to worry about her husband\'s reaction to the\r\nnew vegetable-topped Pascal. Ronald accepted the transformation\r\ngood-naturedly, thinking that a little levity, once in a while, was a\r\ngood thing.\r\n\r\n"And after all," said Corinne later that evening, "I\'m the one who has\r\nto spend all day in the house with ..." She lowered her voice: "With\r\nPascal."\r\n\r\nBut Ronald wasn\'t listening. He retired to his den to finish the plans\r\nfor the mass production of competent mechanical men. One for every home\r\nin America.... He fell asleep with the thought.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCorinne and Pascal spent the next two weeks going through pretty much\r\nthe same routine. He, methodically jolting through the household chores;\r\nshe, walking aimlessly from room to room, smoking too many cigarettes.\r\nShe began to think of Pascal as a boarder. Strange--at first he had been\r\nresponsible for that unwanted feeling. But now his helpfulness around\r\nthe house had lightened her burden. And he was so cheerful all the time!\r\nAfter living with Ronald\'s preoccupied frown for seven years ...\r\n\r\nAfter luncheon one day, when Pascal neglected to shut off the garden\r\nhose, she caught herself scolding him as if he were human. Was that a\r\nshadow from the curtain waving in the breeze, or did she see a hurt look\r\nflit across the mouth of the pumpkin? Corinne put out her hand and\r\npatted Pascal\'s cylindrical wrist.\r\n\r\nIt was warm--_flesh_ warm.\r\n\r\nShe hurried upstairs and stood breathing heavily with her back to the\r\ndoor. A little later she thought she heard someone--someone with a heavy\r\nstep--moving around downstairs.\r\n\r\n"I left the control box down there," she thought. "Of course, it\'s\r\nabsurd...."\r\n\r\nAt four o\'clock she went slowly down the stairs to start Ronald\'s\r\ndinner. Pascal was standing by the refrigerator, exactly where she had\r\nleft him. Not until she had started to peel the potatoes did she notice\r\nthe little bouquet of pansies in the center of the table.\r\n\r\nCorinne felt she needed a strong cup of tea. She put the water on and\r\nplaced a cup on the kitchen table. Not until she was going to sit down\r\ndid she decide that perhaps Pascal should be in the other room.\r\n\r\nShe pressed the red button, the one which should turn him around, and\r\nthe blue button, which should make him walk into the living room. She\r\nheard the little buzz of mechanical life as Pascal began to move. But he\r\ndid not go into the other room! He was holding a chair for her, and she\r\nsat down rather heavily. A sudden rush of pleasure reddened her cheeks.\r\n_Not since sorority days ..._\r\n\r\nBefore Pascal\'s arms moved away she touched his wrist again, softly,\r\nonly this time her hand lingered. And his wrist _was_ warm!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"When do they want Pascal back at the lab?" she asked Ronald at dinner\r\nthat evening, trying to keep her voice casual.\r\n\r\nRonald smiled. "I think I might have him indefinitely, dear. I\'ve got\r\nHardwick convinced I\'m working on something revolutionary." He stopped.\r\n"Oh, Corinne! You\'ve spilled coffee all over yourself."\r\n\r\nThe following night Ronald was late in getting home from work. It was\r\nraining outside the Newark station and the cabs deliberately evaded him.\r\nHe finally caught a bus, which deposited him one block from his house.\r\nHe cut through the back alley, hurrying through the rain. Just before he\r\nstarted up the stairs he glanced through the lighted kitchen window. He\r\nstopped, gripping the railing for support.\r\n\r\nIn the living room were Pascal and Corinne. Pascal was reclining\r\nleisurely in the fireside chair; Corinne was standing in front of him.\r\nIt was the expression on her face which stopped Ronald Lovegear. The\r\nlook was a compound of restraint and compulsion, the reflection of some\r\ndeep struggle in Corinne\'s soul. Then she suddenly leaned forward and\r\npressed her lips to Pascal\'s full, fleshy pumpkin mouth. Slowly, one of\r\nPascal\'s aluminum arms moved up and encircled her waist.\r\n\r\nMr. Lovegear stepped back into the rain. He stood there for several\r\nminutes. The rain curled around the brim of his hat, dropped to his\r\nface, and rolled down his cheeks with the slow agitation of tears.\r\n\r\nWhen, finally, he walked around to the front and stamped heavily up the\r\nstairs, Corinne greeted him with a flush in her cheeks. Ronald told her\r\nthat he didn\'t feel "quite up to dinner. Just coffee, please." When it\r\nwas ready he sipped slowly, watching Corinne\'s figure as she moved\r\naround the room. She avoided looking at the aluminum figure in the\r\nchair.\r\n\r\nRonald put his coffee down, walked over to Pascal, and, gripping him\r\nbehind the shoulders, dragged him into the den.\r\n\r\nCorinne stood looking at the closed door and listened to the furious\r\npounding.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTen minutes later Ronald came out and went straight to the phone.\r\n\r\n"Yes! Immediately!" 

=== Chunk 8 ===
he told the man at the freight office. While he sat\r\nthere waiting Corinne walked upstairs.\r\n\r\nRonald did not offer to help the freight men drag the box outside. When\r\nthey had gone he went into the den and came back with the pumpkin. He\r\nopened the back door and hurled it out into the rain. It cleared the\r\nback fence and rolled down the alley stopping in a small puddle in the\r\ncinders.\r\n\r\nAfter a while the water level reached the mouth and there was a soft\r\nchoking sound. The boy who found it the next morning looked at the mouth\r\nand wondered why anyone would carve such a sad Jack-O\'-Lantern.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _If Worlds of Science Fiction_ July\r\n    1953.
