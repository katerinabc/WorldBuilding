]\r\n\r\n\r\nWinant followed the lanky sheriff down the jail corridor past rows of\r\nempty, plank-walled cells and drew a sharp breath of relief when they\r\nfound the last cubicle still tenanted.\r\n\r\n"That\'s Uncle Ivor, all right," Winant said. "Sorry he caused you so\r\nmuch trouble, sheriff, but I\'ll be glad to pay his fine. What\'s the\r\ncharge against him?"\r\n\r\nThe sheriff rubbed a palm across his drooping mustaches and looked\r\ndoubtfully at the old man who sat on the edge of the cell bunk, the\r\nbald dome of his head cradled dejectedly in his hands.\r\n\r\n"You couldn\'t rightly say there _is_ a charge, mister," he admitted.\r\n"Your uncle popped into Ben Stuart\'s Drop Inn restaurant night before\r\nlast with a little black box under his arm, naked as a jaybird and\r\ntalking like a crazy man.\r\n\r\n"\'I\'m a visitor from Mars,\' he says. \'Take me to your president, and\r\nquick!\' Ben thought he was crazy, or drunk, and ran him out with a meat\r\ncleaver, and the old duck went down to the Warner Hotel and pulled the\r\nsame goofy act. Pop Warner called me, and I went down and threw the old\r\ncoot into the cooler. I knew right off that he was cracked, because I\r\neven had to show him how to put on the clothes I brought him. And the\r\nwingding he pitched when I took that black box away from him--wow!"\r\n\r\nWinant shook his head.

"Poor Uncle Ivor," he said commiseratingly. "The\r\nlast time he got away from us he thought he was Mahatma Ghandi, and\r\ntried to buy a bus ticket from Cincinnati to New Delhi, India. I found\r\nhim, finally, in Evansville, Indiana. It\'s amazing how he got this far\r\nsouth, but then a mentally-unbalanced person can do surprising things,\r\nsometimes."\r\n\r\nThe sheriff snorted. "Unbalanced, hell," he said. "The old coot\'s\r\ncrazy as a bed-bug. Just got in from Mars, he says, and he wants the\r\npresident of the United States--on the double!"\r\n\r\nHe unlocked the door and Winant went inside.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all right now, Uncle Ivor," he said gently. The old man raised\r\na wrinkled, leathery face and stared at him uncomprehendingly. "Let\'s\r\ngo over to my hotel and get a good meal and a hot bath," Winant urged.\r\n"Then we\'ll go home again.

Ready, now?"\r\n\r\nA few minutes later in the jail office the sheriff pocketed the bill\r\nWinant gave him and handed over a small lacquered metal box that was\r\nsurprisingly heavy for its size.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s your uncle\'s radio," he said. "New-fangled model, I reckon. I\r\ncouldn\'t make head nor tail of it, so I just left it alone."\r\n\r\nWinant lifted the hinged cover and looked inside the box at the neat\r\narray of tiny meters and knobs that covered the control panel.\r\n\r\n"A wise decision, sheriff," he said dryly. "Wiser, perhaps, than you\'ll\r\never know."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe old man stood in the center of Winant\'s hotel room, the sheriff\'s\r\nill-fitting denims hanging on his slight frame like the castoff\r\nclothing of a scare-crow.\r\n\r\n"The box," he said. His voice, after talking for so long, was a hoarse,\r\nrasping croak. "Give me the box."\r\n\r\nWinant sat in a decrepit wicker chair, holding the box in his lap, his\r\neyes missing no detail of the old man\'s shrunken figure with its bald\r\ndome-like head and wrinkled parchment face.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll give you the box when you tell me something that makes sense," he\r\nsaid. "What you\'ve just told me is nothing but a rehash of the story\r\nyou told the sheriff--that your name is Yardana and that you are an\r\nenvoy from Mars, sent to Earth to help scientific authorities develop\r\nsafe atomic power. Look--I\'m a news writer, down here to investigate\r\nthe rumors of a blue meteorite landing in the hills just north of here\r\nand to check up on the comic accounts I read of your appearance. I went\r\nto a lot of trouble and some risk to get you out of jail, and I want a\r\nreasonable story for my trouble.

What about it, now?

"\r\n\r\nThe old man wrung his hands. "Give me the box. Give me the box!"\r\n\r\n"Later," Winant promised. "When you give me the real story behind this\r\nthing I\'ll not only give you back your box, I\'ll give you a lift out of\r\nthis burg as well."\r\n\r\nHe looked at the old man sharply. "How could a Martian speak the kind\r\nof English you\'ve been using? Why should a Martian look so much like an\r\nordinary human being? It doesn\'t add up."\r\n\r\n"We are of the same root stock," Yardana said. "Intelligent life\r\nfollows the same evolutionary pattern, no matter where it develops, so\r\nlong as conditions are the same. As for the language, my people have\r\nfollowed your experiments with electro-magnetics since their beginning.\r\nWe know every language of Earth intimately, through long study of your\r\nradio programs."\r\n\r\nWinant laughed. "Maybe the sheriff was right, at that," he said. "It\'s\r\na goofy story, too fantastic for belief."\r\n\r\nHe shrugged and handed the old man the black box.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s your toy," he said resignedly. "I guess that\'s all I\'m\r\ngoing to get for my trouble; just enough misinformation for another\r\ntongue-in-cheek article for Sunday supplements."\r\n\r\nHe picked up his brief-case from the floor and laid it on the corner of\r\nthe writing table at his elbow. "The lift I promised you still goes, if\r\nyou want it, but it\'ll have to wait until tomorrow."\r\n\r\nThe old man took the black box eagerly and threw back the cover. His\r\nfingers flickered over the controls with practised familiarity.\r\n\r\n"I shall not need your assistance--now," he said. His pale eyes met\r\nWinant\'s triumphantly. "Now that I have the Bubble again I have a means\r\nof return to my ship better than any Earthly conveyance could offer.\r\nWatch!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom the black box swelled a pulsing radiance, a misty rose-tinted\r\nsphere that grew swiftly until it enveloped Yardana in a six-foot\r\nbubble of iridescent light. Through its wavering envelope the old\r\nman\'s face showed taut and purposeful, its pleading replaced by grim\r\ndetermination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From the black box swelled a pulsing bubble of\r\niridescent light._]\r\n\r\n"Print your story," he said. "Tell your people about Yardana and his\r\nmission. Tell them too that their days are numbered from this minute,\r\nfor in their savage perversion of natural principles to warlike uses\r\nthey have forged a menace that threatens the peace of the Solar System\r\nand, eventually, of the universe itself."\r\n\r\nHe moved toward the window, the rosy Bubble glowing about him. Winant\r\nturned his chair slightly, watching, but he did not rise.\r\n\r\n"My people knew the secrets of the atom," Yardana said, "before your\r\nown learned the use of fire. We built great cities and telescopes\r\nwhen your ancestors were troglodytes, living in caves and eating\r\nuncooked meat. We expected no dangerous intelligence to arise on your\r\nplanet for thousands of years as yet, and we paid little attention\r\nto your progress until recently, when we learned through your radio\r\nbroadcasts that you had cracked the atom. We knew then that something\r\nwas dangerously wrong, and that we must investigate quickly before your\r\nsudden wisdom put you upon equal footing with us.\r\n\r\n"Today, when you should be only learning to compound gunpowder, we\r\nfind you applying electromagnetic principles which you cannot possibly\r\nunderstand, and harnessing the atom for the sole purpose of killing\r\ngreater numbers of your fellow beings. I came here, not to aid your\r\nscientists in developing the rudiments of the atomic power they\r\nhave discovered, but to find the reason behind the sudden freakish\r\nintelligence they are displaying. I have discovered that reason--the\r\nscientific and political powers of Earth are under the domination and\r\nguidance of alien intelligences, entities bent upon developing a race\r\nof Earthmen so warlike and so technically proficient in the waging of\r\nwar that it must endanger our own Martian culture."\r\n\r\nWinant sat unmoving, his eyes not leaving the Martian\'s wrinkled face.\r\nThe Bubble hissed audibly, its tiny sussuration suddenly loud in the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n"Therefore I shall recommend in my report that the human race be\r\ncompletely destroyed," Yardana said. "Alone it could not offer\r\na serious threat against us for ages, but led and instructed by\r\nthese outside intelligences it must soon surpass our own scientific\r\ndevelopment. And we must destroy you before you learn the secret of\r\nspace travel, or we shall be too late to save ourselves.\r\n\r\n"We fought with the peoples of Venus once in ages past for the same\r\nreason, and reduced them to inconsequence if not to extinction, for no\r\nsign of intelligent life has been detected upon their world since we\r\nblasted it three thousand years ago. When I have made my report the\r\ncouncil of Elders will recommend the blasting of Earth, and the solar\r\nsystem will be safe again for our superior Martian civilization--this\r\ntime forever."\r\n\r\n"When you have made your report," Winant said. His smile was edged with\r\na sudden secret amusement. "But suppose these \'alien entities\' prevent\r\nyour return?"\r\n\r\nHe opened the brief-case on the table and put a hand inside it. The\r\nMartian laughed harshly.\r\n\r\n"No missile can penetrate a Bubble, you fool," he said contemptuously.\r\n"It is impervious to any Earthly weapon."\r\n\r\nWinant laughed in turn, his lips pressed back flat against his teeth.\r\nThe repressed hatred of three thousand years spoke in his voice, added\r\npressure to the thrust of his thumb on the stud of the little silver\r\ntube in his hand.\r\n\r\n"Of course it is," he said, as the sullen crimson ray from the tube\r\ndisintegrated Martian, box and Bubble alike in a breath. "That\'s why I\r\ncame prepared--with a Venusian weapon!"\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
