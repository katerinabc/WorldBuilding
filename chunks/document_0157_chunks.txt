Well meet a man\r\n            from the future--who\'d gladly trade places!...\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Imagination Stories of Science and Fantasy\r\n                              April 1953\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bed woke them. "Time to get up, dears," it cooed. "Time to get up\r\nand greet the sun ... time to get up...." Then the supporting magnetism\r\nfaded and let their mattress drift gently to the soft warm floor.\r\n\r\nJanet turned and opened her eyes, pouting at Les. He scowled back,\r\ngrumbled something, and rolled away. She shook his film-coated shoulder.\r\n\r\n"Come on, Les. Come on, you\'ll feel better after coffee."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t want any," he snarled.\r\n\r\nBut the damage had been done. At the word "coffee" a grotesque\r\nmarionette opened the bedroom door and minced in with two steaming\r\ncups on a tray, swinging them artfully so that they appeared likely to\r\nspill, but didn\'t.\r\n\r\nFor some years, now, that dance had left Janet unamused. She was about\r\nto say so when Les growled, "These darned dolls are a nuisance. I wish\r\nyou\'d order a plain, automatic dispenser!"\r\n\r\n"_They\'re_ even _more_ boring," Janet argued, sitting up. Her gauzy\r\nfilm-dress and sleepy face made her look appealingly childlike. She\r\nwas fifty-five.\r\n\r\nLes was sixty, with a full head of blond hair atop six and a half feet\r\nof slim solid flesh. He sat up with the expression of an exasperated\r\nsix-year-old.\r\n\r\n"Go away!" he told the doll. It did.\r\n\r\n"But I _wanted_ some!" Janet wailed. She was careful, though, not to\r\nuse the words that would cause the doll to return.\r\n\r\nNeither did Les. He said, "Why don\'t we take a couple of pills and go\r\nback to sleep till tomorrow? There isn\'t a darned thing to do."\r\n\r\n"There _never_ is," Janet said. Then noting she\'d inadvertently agreed\r\nwith her husband, she quickly added, "But we _can\'t_ sleep--we did\r\nthat yesterday. If we don\'t move around we\'ll practically stop eating,\r\nand anyway the neighbors will miss us. First thing you know we\'ll be\r\naccused of either a hunger-strike or immobility. Then they\'ll enslave\r\nus for attempting suicide!" She sniffed in self-pity at the thought.\r\n\r\n"Ah, honk \'em!" Les said. "Slavery\'d at least be a change. And slaves\r\nhave something to do!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t talk nonsense," Janet said tartly. "You know perfectly well they\r\nalways torture slaves."\r\n\r\n"Yeah.... But I just can\'t face this any longer! I\'ve got sixty-five\r\nmore years of longevity, according to the doctors--and they\'re never\r\nwrong, curse them! Sixty-five more years without the possibility of\r\nillness, want, risk.... Even an accident is unlikely. Nothing\'s going\r\nto happen in all that time! Jan, I just can\'t face it."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t that just like a man?" she scoffed. "You know very well _I\'ve_\r\ngot _seventy_ years to go--five still to wait before I can even have my\r\nfirst child! You\'re just being selfish!

"\r\n\r\nThey glowered at each other. Then Les rubbed her cheek with the back of\r\nhis hand, and smiled.\r\n\r\n"Thanks, kid," he said. "You really had me going for a minute. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Now I\r\nfeel better!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPleased with the compliment, Janet concocted an extra-fancy combination\r\nof films to spray on herself for the morning\'s wear. When it was\r\nin place, she ordered a large breakfast and arranged to have the\r\nwaiter-doll do a special dance-routine while serving.\r\n\r\nBut Les\'s smile had vanished with the whiskers he\'d rubbed off. He\r\npicked at his food, turned his back on the dancing, and afterward\r\nyawned away the few minutes they spent on their apartment\'s terrace,\r\nstared at by fifty thousand neighbors who lacked anything better to do.\r\nWhen Les wandered idly off, Janet followed.\r\n\r\nLes went to the living room, projected a book onto the ceiling,\r\nswitched it off without reading, played with the glowing phosphors\r\nthat lighted the room in colors he varied jarringly, fiddled with the\r\nconsole of the perfume aerosol and created a stink, and then, in sheer\r\ndespair, turned on the puppet-set.\r\n\r\nIts lighted screen listed the necessary dolls and props, so he laid\r\nthem out. Soon the three-foot stage reflected a broadcast picture of\r\nthe State Executive Office. A stringless, formally-dressed puppet sat\r\nat a desk, its blank face a transmitted facsimile of the Governor\'s.\r\n\r\n"... the last time I can make this announcement," the Governor was\r\nsaying into a hidden microphone. "The tests are to begin at noon. Jobs\r\nare now open! I repeat: jobs are now open! Men only, of course. But if\r\nany of you fellows out there suffer from boredom--and who doesn\'t in\r\nthis wonderful State of ours that by virtue of the New Energy-Sources\r\nguarantees leisured security to each citizen--if, I repeat, you suffer\r\nfrom ennui, then why not apply for a job?\r\n\r\n"Do it now--no further vacancies will occur for years, and we have some\r\nreally desirable positions open this morning. Appointments will be made\r\nstrictly on merit, as usual, with a job for every applicant and the\r\nbest job for the top man.\r\n\r\n"Though it\'s true that losers in this competition are required to\r\nassume for life the less desirable duties that our civilization\r\nimposes, I assure you that isn\'t as bad as it sounds. I was pretty far\r\ndown the list in my day, yet I only have to be Governor....\r\n\r\n"So won\'t you please apply? I want a _lot_ of competition!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe stage darkened, and the puppet got up and walked to its box. Before\r\nthe lights could go up on the next program, Les switched the set off.\r\n\r\n"What do you think?" he asked Janet.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," she said. "Nobody in _my_ family has ever worked."\r\n\r\n"Mine, either. But I once knew a fellow who\'d tried for a job. He\r\nseemed o.k. to me, but he sure didn\'t get a good one! Had a clerical\r\nposition, with business machines, and their output was geared down\r\nto spread the work. So he didn\'t have enough to do ... just stacked\r\npunched cards or something every day for eighty years!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, you\'d do better than that, dear!"\r\n\r\n"Maybe. Point is, there _are_ jobs worse than no job at all!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not so sure!" Janet said, suddenly determined. "Only a few minutes\r\nago you weren\'t very happy about the idle days ahead. Why not take a\r\nchance?

=== Chunk 4 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Take a chance? What kind of language is that? Chance went out along\r\nwith disease and poverty and crime and accidents. You\'re way off base,\r\nJan!"\r\n\r\n"But you have a chance--oh, all right!--an opportunity, then, if you\r\nlike that better, to get a _good_ job. Now, if I were a man--"\r\n\r\n"But you\'re not.... Still ... maybe I\'ll try it...."\r\n\r\nFor the first time in a month or two, Janet kissed him warmly. And\r\nafter she\'d helped him into his wings and seen him off from the\r\nterrace, she felt a strange warm glow of anticipation. Not since she\'d\r\nmarried had there been need for a decision that could bring change into\r\nher life. This was a Day!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was a Day for a lot of others, too. She learned that from the noon\r\nbroadcast of the test ceremony.\r\n\r\n"In my time," the Governor said, speaking from the Capitol\'s rotunda,\r\n"in my time a hundred aspirants was considered a good turnout. Today\'s\r\napplicants total a thousand! We haven\'t actually got a thousand jobs\r\nlined up, but we\'ll get \'em! And I\'m privileged to announce, now that\r\nthe list of competitors has closed, that we do have the astoundingly\r\nlarge number of ten--repeat, ten--genuinely desirable appointments to\r\nmake."\r\n\r\nTen good jobs for a thousand applicants didn\'t sound to Janet\r\nlike an astoundingly large number. She\'d been sprawled on a\r\nmagnetically-positioned pad half-way between floor and ceiling, but\r\nshe sat up when the Governor stopped talking, and with a twinge of\r\ngenuine and unwonted anxiety watched the long file of applicants as\r\nthey approached in turn the brain-wave analyzer, the voice-operated\r\nsorter that would add their life-files to current test results, and the\r\nofficials who judged each man\'s configuration.\r\n\r\nShe wished they\'d announce the test results publicly, but knew they\r\nwouldn\'t. So, when Les had gone through--about twenty minutes after the\r\nstart--Janet shut off the broadcast, dissolved her dress-films, and\r\nhad herself rubbed by the massage machine. The morning\'s suspense was\r\nproving too much for her, and she didn\'t want to have a headache when\r\nLes came home.\r\n\r\nBut even the mechanical masseuse couldn\'t rub away her strange\r\nfeelings. Not since marriage had Janet felt curiosity as to the future.\r\n\r\nWhat if he got so dull they never even argued about anything? She\r\nshivered at the thought--but then she smiled. And for the next hour\r\nJanet lay under the soothing massage and gave herself up to the\r\ndelightful new pleasure of worrying.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Les returned, shadowing the terrace in his descent like some\r\nportentous bird, Janet began to shake. Without even waiting to kiss\r\nhim, she said, "How was it? How did you do?

=== Chunk 5 ===
"\r\n\r\nLes grinned teasingly. "Help me moult, first," he said. "I\'m tired."\r\n\r\nUnable to get anything else out of him until it was done, she tore\r\nhis wings off damagingly, kissed him, and said, "_Now_ won\'t you say\r\nsomething?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m hungry!"\r\n\r\n"No!" She danced her impatience like a little girl. "Tell me!"\r\n\r\nBut even as she pouted, her eyes sparkled in anticipation.\r\n\r\n"I start tomorrow," he said.\r\n\r\n"Did you get the best job?"\r\n\r\n"Nope. No, I really didn\'t.

=== Chunk 6 ===
"\r\n\r\n"What, then?"\r\n\r\n"Second best!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, wonderful! 

=== Chunk 7 ===
What is it?"\r\n\r\n"Rigger and high-climber--topping trees, setting structural iron,\r\nfixing flag-poles--that sort of thing. Powderman was first."\r\n\r\n"Oh, rigger\'s wonderful!" Visions of his future work flashed across her\r\nmind, implanted there by childhood hours spent watching other members\r\nof this elite profession at their thrilling work. She knew there could\r\nbe broken cables, falling pulleys, snapped booms, dropped loads--every\r\nday would have its interesting possibilities!\r\n\r\n"My darling!" She threw her arms around him and was momentarily\r\nsilenced by his kiss.\r\n\r\nThen she stepped back, looked admiringly up at him, and said, "Oh, I\'m\r\nso happy for you! And so proud! 

=== Chunk 8 ===
I\'m going right in and order up a nice\r\nbig meal. I know you\'ll enjoy this one--it really _might_ be your last!"\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
