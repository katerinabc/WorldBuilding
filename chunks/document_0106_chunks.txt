Here he turns to a different problem--the\r\n    adjustment demanded of a pioneer woman, not in those days but\r\n    Tomorrow--on Mars._\r\n\r\n\r\n moment\r\n     of\r\n  truth\r\n\r\n _by BASIL WELLS_\r\n\r\n\r\n Beyond the false windows she could see the reddish\r\n wasteland where dust clouds spun and shifted so slowly.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe had been asleep. Now she stretched luxuriously beneath the crisp\r\nwhite sheet that the vapid August heat decreed. From memory to memory\r\nher dream-fogged mind drifted, and to the yet-to-be. It was good to\r\nremember, and to imagine, and to see and feel and hear....\r\n\r\nShe smiled. She was Ruth Halsey, fourteen, brunette, and pretty. Earl,\r\nand Harry, and Buhl had told her she was pretty. Especially Buhl. Buhl\r\nwas her favorite date now.\r\n\r\nThe room closed around her with its familiar colors and furnishings.\r\nSometimes she would dream that she was elsewhere, unfamiliar, ugly\r\nplaces, but then she would awaken to the four long windows with their\r\ncoarse beige drapes of monk\'s cloth and the fantasies were forever\r\ndispelled.\r\n\r\nHer eyes loved the two paintings, the dark curls of the pink-and-white\r\ndoll sitting prissily atop the dresser, and the full-length mirror on\r\nthe open closet door.\r\n\r\nThe pictured design of the wallpaper, its background merging with the\r\npastel blue of the slanted ceiling.... Almost as they had blended\r\ntogether that first day when she was twelve. Yet not the same, she\r\ncorrected her thoughts, frowning. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
Sometimes, as today, the design seemed\r\nfaded and changed. The gay little bridges and the flowered, impossibly\r\nblue trees seemed to change and threaten to vanish.\r\n\r\nShe laughed over at the demurely sitting doll. Essie had been her\r\nfavorite doll when she was younger. Of course now that she was fourteen\r\nshe did not play with dolls any more. But it was permissible that she\r\nkeep her old friend neatly dressed and ever at hand as a confidant. She\r\nsmiled at the thought. Essie never tattled.\r\n\r\n"It must be from that polio," she told Essie, knowing all the time that\r\nshe was almost well now and needed plenty of rest and careful doses of\r\nexercise. "It makes my eyes--funny."\r\n\r\nEssie smiled back glassily and Ruth laughed. It was good to awaken and\r\nsee the thick black arms of the maple tree outside the windows. It was\r\ngood to have the cool green leaves waving at her, and see the filtered\r\ndapplings of sunshine cross and recross them.\r\n\r\nShe loved that old tree. She had played among its long horizontal\r\nbranches from childhood. Her brother, Alex, who had been killed in the\r\nNormandy Landing during World War Three, had loved the tree too. He had\r\nbuilt the railed, shingled-roofed little nest high up in the tree\'s\r\ncrotched heart where Ruth kept some of her extra-special notes and\r\njewelry and a book of poems.\r\n\r\nOne of the two paintings on the bedroom walls was of the old tree. The\r\ntree dominated the old story-and-a-half white house with the green\r\nshutters that was the Halseys\' home. Her home. Alex had painted that\r\npicture as well as the other showing the graceful loop of the river and\r\nthe roofs of the village of Thayer in the distance. Ruth had been with\r\nhim as he painted that second picture from the jutting rock ledge five\r\nhundred feet above the river.\r\n\r\n"I was just ten then, Essie," she chirped gaily. "I remember how afraid\r\nI was of the height and how Alex scolded."\r\n\r\nBut Alex was dead now and all she had to remember of him was the\r\npaintings and the photographs that Mother kept in a battered brown\r\nleather folder. For a moment the bright sunlight in her beloved maple\r\ntree\'s leaves seemed to dim and the room wavered about her. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
She wondered\r\nabout that. She must tell her father or her mother.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the polio, light touch of it or not, had hurt her eyesight.\r\nGlasses! She shuddered at the thought.\r\n\r\nThe room shimmered and blurred--and suddenly broke apart to reform into\r\nsomething.... She squinched her eyes shut to the hideous vision. And\r\nthen opened them the merest slit.\r\n\r\nNothing had changed....\r\n\r\n"MOTHER!" she cried. "Daddy!" she cried. "What has happened?"\r\n\r\nShe heard the door to--to this hideous travesty of a room opening. Her\r\neyes darted around the shrunken metal-walled shell, even the ceiling\r\ncurved overhead, and she saw two grotesque daubs taped to the walls that\r\nparodied the paintings of her dead brother Alex. The coloring was ugly\r\nand the proportions out of line. And it was not canvas but curling\r\nsheets of paper taped and painted to resemble frames!\r\n\r\nA big man, sandy-haired and with vertical wrinkles deep between piercing\r\nblue eyes, came into the room. She shrank into the bed, seeing that the\r\nsheet she tugged taut across her breast was ragged and blue.\r\n\r\n"Ruth," he said, a slow smile making his face almost handsome, "you\'re\r\nbetter. You haven\'t spoken in weeks."\r\n\r\nRuth wanted to giggle. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
As though they could keep her quiet. Daddy was\r\nalways shushing her.... But who was this big man in his dusty drab\r\ncoveralls and dropped dust mask dangling upon his chest?\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you know me, Dear? It\'s Buhl, your husband."\r\n\r\nBuhl was fifteen and only a couple of inches taller than Ruth. Of course\r\nhe had sandy hair like this man. But this man was old enough to be\r\nBuhl\'s father. This was crazy--like one of the dreams that always made\r\nher unhappy.\r\n\r\nSo? 

=== Chunk 5 ===
So it was a dream. She felt warmth and release. Why not see what\r\nthis dream had to offer that might be amusing to remember and tell Buhl\r\nsometime soon. Wouldn\'t he laugh when he heard she had dreamed about\r\nhim? And been married to him.\r\n\r\nShe saw the strip of shiny metal that masqueraded as her mirror, and\r\nwhere her four long windows, with their thick, loose-woven drapes, had\r\nbeen there were only four taped strips of paper with crude pictures of\r\ndraped windows daubed on them. There were even green dabs of paint and\r\nblack splashes to stimulate her beloved maple tree.\r\n\r\n"Ruth! Do you feel better now? 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Please don\'t smile at me like that. I\r\nknow you loved the baby, but this Martian atmosphere is tough even for\r\nmen. It wasn\'t your fault."\r\n\r\n"Go ahead and talk," Ruth laughed gaily. "This is just another bad dream\r\nand I know it. I\'ll wake up in a little while and be back in my cool old\r\nroom."\r\n\r\n"Blast your room and your dreams!"\r\n\r\nThe man went across the room in a swift rush and tore down one of the\r\nfalse windows, the painted strip of paper. And beyond, through a dusty\r\noval glass window, Ruth could see a reddish brown wasteland, where dust\r\nclouds spun and shifted slowly, and a dusty huddle of what looked like\r\nquonset huts or storage sheds of metal.\r\n\r\n"That is reality, Ruth. You must face it. This pretense, this sleazy\r\nimitation of your old room is wrong. You\'re strong enough, and I love\r\nyou--you can accept truth."\r\n\r\nHis face changed, all expression sponged from it in an instant as he\r\nlooked into her eyes, and then it seemed to dissolve into something ugly\r\nand yet childish. She saw tears burst through and furrow the dust on his\r\ncheeks.\r\n\r\n"Dear Lord," he cried, almost reverently, "must this go on forever? Will\r\nshe ever come back to me?"\r\n\r\nHis voice choked off and he stumbled across the room and out the door.\r\nShe heard it shut behind him, and she was hunting for Essie, already\r\nhaving forgotten the ill-mannered intruder.\r\n\r\nThere was no Essie, only a mannikin of cloth-stuffed white nylon and\r\nlipstick, with black nylon for hair.\r\n\r\nAnd then the room shimmered and broke apart and reformed and she was\r\nback in her bed with the sun on the slowly dancing green leaves outside\r\nthe four long windows. Essie was smiling down at her from the dresser,\r\nand the paintings were as always, soft colors and perfectly drafted.\r\n\r\nHad she thought there were four windows? How silly of her. The second\r\nfrom the right was a small oval of glass, or rather, a glass-covered\r\npicture of desert scene. Odd that she had forgotten about that picture.\r\nOh well, what did it matter.\r\n\r\nIn a few days she would be well enough again to climb out on the giant\r\nlimbs and into the tree nest that her brother, Alex, had built. And the\r\nboys would come to see her and take her to the drugstore for sodas and\r\nsundaes.\r\n\r\nYes, she was sure now. She _did_ like Buhl Austin best....\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ December 1957.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.
