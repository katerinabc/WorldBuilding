B. Fyfe\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TALKATIVE TREE\r\n\r\n\r\n    Dang vines! Beats all how some plants\r\n    have no manners--but what do you expect,\r\n    when they used to be men!\r\n\r\n\r\nAll things considered--the obscure star, the undetermined damage to the\r\nstellar drive and the way the small planet\'s murky atmosphere defied\r\nprecision scanners--the pilot made a reasonably good landing. Despite\r\nsour feelings for the space service of Haurtoz, steward Peter Kolin had\r\nto admit that casualties might have been far worse.\r\n\r\nChief Steward Slichow led his little command, less two third-class\r\nration keepers thought to have been trapped in the lower hold, to a\r\npoint two hundred meters from the steaming hull of the _Peace State_. He\r\nlined them up as if on parade. Kolin made himself inconspicuous.\r\n\r\n"Since the crew will be on emergency watches repairing the damage,"\r\nannounced the Chief in clipped, aggressive tones, "I have volunteered my\r\nsection for preliminary scouting, as is suitable. It may be useful to\r\ndiscover temporary sources in this area of natural foods."\r\n\r\n_Volunteered HIS section!_ thought Kolin rebelliously.\r\n\r\n_Like the Supreme Director of Haurtoz! Being conscripted into this\r\nidiotic space fleet that never fights is bad enough without a tin god on\r\njets like Slichow!_\r\n\r\nPrudently, he did not express this resentment overtly.\r\n\r\nHis well-schooled features revealed no trace of the idea--or of any\r\nother idea. The Planetary State of Haurtoz had been organized some\r\nfifteen light-years from old Earth, but many of the home world\'s less\r\nkindly techniques had been employed. Lack of complete loyalty to the\r\nstate was likely to result in a siege of treatment that left the subject\r\nsuitably "re-personalized." Kolin had heard of instances wherein mere\r\nunenthusiastic posture had betrayed intentions to harbor treasonable\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\n"You will scout in five details of three persons each," Chief Slichow\r\nsaid. "Every hour, each detail will send one person in to report, and he\r\nwill be replaced by one of the five I shall keep here to issue rations."\r\n\r\nKolin permitted himself to wonder when anyone might get some rest, but\r\nassumed a mildly willing look. (Too eager an attitude could arouse\r\nsuspicion of disguising an improper viewpoint.) The maintenance of a\r\nproper viewpoint was a necessity if the Planetary State were to survive\r\nthe hostile plots of Earth and the latter\'s decadent colonies. That, at\r\nleast, was the official line.\r\n\r\nKolin found himself in a group with Jak Ammet, a third cook, and Eva\r\nYrtok, powdered foods storekeeper. Since the crew would be eating\r\npackaged rations during repairs, Yrtok could be spared to command a\r\nscout detail.\r\n\r\nEach scout was issued a rocket pistol and a plastic water tube. Chief\r\nSlichow emphasized that the keepers of rations could hardly, in an\r\nemergency, give even the appearance of favoring themselves in regard to\r\nfood. They would go without. Kolin maintained a standard expression as\r\nthe Chief\'s sharp stare measured them.\r\n\r\nYrtok, a dark, lean-faced girl, led the way with a quiet monosyllable.\r\nShe carried the small radio they would be permitted to use for messages\r\nof utmost urgency. Ammet followed, and Kolin brought up the rear.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo reach their assigned sector, they had to climb a forbidding ridge of\r\nrock within half a kilometer. Only a sparse creeper grew along their\r\nway, its elongated leaves shimmering with bronze-green reflections\r\nagainst a stony surface; but when they topped the ridge a thick forest\r\nwas in sight.\r\n\r\nYrtok and Ammet paused momentarily before descending.\r\n\r\nKolin shared their sense of isolation. They would be out of sight of\r\nauthority and responsible for their own actions. It was a strange\r\nsensation.\r\n\r\nThey marched down into the valley at a brisk pace, becoming more aware\r\nof the clouds and atmospheric haze. Distant objects seemed blurred by\r\nthe mist, taking on a somber, brooding grayness. For all Kolin could\r\ntell, he and the others were isolated in a world bounded by the rocky\r\nridge behind them and a semi-circle of damp trees and bushes several\r\nhundred meters away. He suspected that the hills rising mistily ahead\r\nwere part of a continuous slope, but could not be sure.\r\n\r\nYrtok led the way along the most nearly level ground. Low creepers\r\nbecame more plentiful, interspersed with scrubby thickets of tangled,\r\nspike-armored bushes. Occasionally, small flying things flickered among\r\nthe foliage. Once, a shrub puffed out an enormous cloud of tiny spores.\r\n\r\n"Be a job to find anything edible here," grunted Ammet, and Kolin\r\nagreed.\r\n\r\nFinally, after a longer hike than he had anticipated, they approached\r\nthe edge of the deceptively distant forest. Yrtok paused to examine some\r\npurple berries glistening dangerously on a low shrub. Kolin regarded the\r\ntrees with misgiving.\r\n\r\n"Looks as tough to get through as a tropical jungle," he remarked.\r\n\r\n"I think the stuff puts out shoots that grow back into the ground to\r\nroot as they spread," said the woman. "Maybe we can find a way through."\r\n\r\nIn two or three minutes, they reached the abrupt border of the\r\nodd-looking trees.\r\n\r\nExcept for one thick trunked giant, all of them were about the same\r\nheight. They craned their necks to estimate the altitude of the monster,\r\nbut the top was hidden by the wide spread of branches. The depths behind\r\nit looked dark and impenetrable.\r\n\r\n"We\'d better explore along the edge," decided Yrtok. "Ammet, now is the\r\ntime to go back and tell the Chief which way we\'re--_Ammet!_"\r\n\r\nKolin looked over his shoulder. Fifty meters away, Ammet sat beside the\r\nbush with the purple berries, utterly relaxed.\r\n\r\n"He must have tasted some!" exclaimed Kolin. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
"I\'ll see how he is."\r\n\r\nHe ran back to the cook and shook him by the shoulder. Ammet\'s head\r\nlolled loosely to one side. His rather heavy features were vacant,\r\nlending him a doped appearance. Kolin straightened up and beckoned to\r\nYrtok.\r\n\r\nFor some reason, he had trouble attracting her attention. Then he\r\nnoticed that she was kneeling.\r\n\r\n"Hope she didn\'t eat some stupid thing too!" he grumbled, trotting back.\r\n\r\nAs he reached her, whatever Yrtok was examining came to life and scooted\r\ninto the underbrush with a flash of greenish fur. All Kolin saw was that\r\nit had several legs too many.\r\n\r\nHe pulled Yrtok to her feet. She pawed at him weakly, eyes as vacant as\r\nAmmet\'s. When he let go in sudden horror, she folded gently to the\r\nground. She lay comfortably on her side, twitching one hand as if to\r\nbrush something away.\r\n\r\nWhen she began to smile dreamily, Kolin backed away.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe corners of his mouth felt oddly stiff; they had involuntarily drawn\r\nback to expose his clenched teeth. He glanced warily about, but nothing\r\nappeared to threaten him.\r\n\r\n"It\'s time to end this scout," he told himself. "It\'s dangerous. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
One\r\ngood look and I\'m jetting off! What I need is an easy tree to climb."\r\n\r\nHe considered the massive giant. Soaring thirty or forty meters into the\r\nthin fog and dwarfing other growth, it seemed the most promising choice.\r\n\r\nAt first, Kolin saw no way, but then the network of vines clinging to\r\nthe rugged trunk suggested a route. He tried his weight gingerly, then\r\nbegan to climb.\r\n\r\n"I should have brought Yrtok\'s radio," he muttered. "Oh, well, I can\r\ntake it when I come down, if she hasn\'t snapped out of her spell by\r\nthen. Funny ... I wonder if that green thing bit her."\r\n\r\nFootholds were plentiful among the interlaced lianas. Kolin progressed\r\nrapidly. When he reached the first thick limbs, twice head height, he\r\nfelt safer.\r\n\r\nLater, at what he hoped was the halfway mark, he hooked one knee over a\r\nbranch and paused to wipe sweat from his eyes. Peering down, he\r\ndiscovered the ground to be obscured by foliage.\r\n\r\n"I should have checked from down there to see how open the top is," he\r\nmused. "I wonder how the view will be from up there?"\r\n\r\n"Depends on what you\'re looking for, Sonny!" something remarked in a\r\nsoughing wheeze.\r\n\r\nKolin, slipping, grabbed desperately for the branch. His fingers\r\nclutched a handful of twigs and leaves, which just barely supported him\r\nuntil he regained a grip with the other hand.\r\n\r\nThe branch quivered resentfully under him.\r\n\r\n"Careful, there!" whooshed the eerie voice. "It took me all summer to\r\ngrow those!"\r\n\r\nKolin could feel the skin crawling along his backbone.\r\n\r\n"Who _are_ you?" he gasped.\r\n\r\nThe answering sigh of laughter gave him a distinct chill despite its\r\nsuggestion of amiability.\r\n\r\n"Name\'s Johnny Ashlew. Kinda thought you\'d start with _what_ I am.\r\nDidn\'t figure you\'d ever seen a man grown into a tree before."\r\n\r\nKolin looked about, seeing little but leaves and fog.\r\n\r\n"I have to climb down," he told himself in a reasonable tone. "It\'s bad\r\nenough that the other two passed out without me going space happy too."\r\n\r\n"What\'s your hurry?" 

=== Chunk 4 ===
demanded the voice. "I can talk to you just as easy\r\nall the way down, you know. Airholes in my bark--I\'m not like an Earth\r\ntree."\r\n\r\nKolin examined the bark of the crotch in which he sat. It did seem to\r\nhave assorted holes and hollows in its rough surface.\r\n\r\n"I never saw an Earth tree," he admitted. "We came from Haurtoz."\r\n\r\n"Where\'s that? Oh, never mind--some little planet. I don\'t bother with\r\nthem all, since I came here and found out I could be anything I wanted."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean, anything you wanted?" asked Kolin, testing the\r\nfirmness of a vertical vine.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Just what I said," continued the voice, sounding closer in his ear as\r\nhis cheek brushed the ridged bark of the tree trunk. "And, if I do have\r\nto remind you, it would be nicer if you said \'Mr. Ashlew,\' considering\r\nmy age."\r\n\r\n"Your age? How old--?"\r\n\r\n"Can\'t really count it in Earth years any more. Lost track. I always\r\nfigured bein\' a tree was a nice, peaceful life; and when I remembered\r\nhow long some of them live, that settled it. Sonny, this world ain\'t\r\nall it looks like."\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t, Mr. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Ashlew?" asked Kolin, twisting about in an effort to see\r\nwhat the higher branches might hide.\r\n\r\n"Nope. Most everything here is run by the Life--that is, by the thing\r\nthat first grew big enough to do some thinking, and set its roots down\r\nall over until it had control. That\'s the outskirts of it down below."\r\n\r\n"The other trees? That jungle?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s more\'n a jungle, Sonny. When I landed here, along with the others\r\nfrom the _Arcturan Spark_, the planet looked pretty empty to me, just\r\nlike it must have to--Watch it, there, Boy! If I didn\'t twist that\r\nbranch over in time, you\'d be bouncing off my roots right now!"\r\n\r\n"Th-thanks!" grunted Kolin, hanging on grimly.\r\n\r\n"Doggone vine!" commented the windy whisper. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
"_He_ ain\'t one of my\r\ncrowd. Landed years later in a ship from some star towards the center of\r\nthe galaxy. You should have seen his looks before the Life got in touch\r\nwith his mind and set up a mental field to help him change form. He\r\nlooks twice as good as a vine!"\r\n\r\n"He\'s very handy," agreed Kolin politely. He groped for a foothold.\r\n\r\n"Well ... matter of fact, I can\'t get through to him much, even with the\r\nLife\'s mental field helping. Guess he started living with a different\r\nway of thinking. It burns me. I thought of being a tree, and then he\r\ncame along to take advantage of it!"\r\n\r\nKolin braced himself securely to stretch tiring muscles.\r\n\r\n"Maybe I\'d better stay a while," he muttered. "I don\'t know where I am."\r\n\r\n"You\'re about fifty feet up," the sighing voice informed him. "You ought\r\nto let me tell you how the Life helps you change form. You don\'t _have_\r\nto be a tree."\r\n\r\n"No?"\r\n\r\n"_Uh_-uh! Some of the boys that landed with me wanted to get around and\r\nsee things. Lots changed to animals or birds. One even stayed a man--on\r\nthe outside anyway. Most of them have to change as the bodies wear out,\r\nwhich I don\'t, and some made bad mistakes tryin\' to be things they saw\r\non other planets."\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t want to do that, Mr. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Ashlew."\r\n\r\n"There\'s just one thing. The Life don\'t like taking chances on word\r\nabout this place gettin\' around. It sorta believes in peace and quiet.\r\nYou might not get back to your ship in any form that could tell tales."\r\n\r\n"Listen!" Kolin blurted out. "I wasn\'t so much enjoying being what I was\r\nthat getting back matters to me!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t like your home planet, whatever the name was?"\r\n\r\n"Haurtoz. It\'s a rotten place. A Planetary State! You have to think and\r\neven look the way that\'s standard thirty hours a day, asleep or awake.\r\nYou get scared to sleep for fear you might _dream_ treason and they\'d\r\nfind out somehow."\r\n\r\n"Whooeee! Heard about them places. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
Must be tough just to live."\r\n\r\nSuddenly, Kolin found himself telling the tree about life on Haurtoz,\r\nand of the officially announced threats to the Planetary State\'s planned\r\nexpansion. He dwelt upon the desperation of having no place to hide in\r\ncase of trouble with the authorities. A multiple system of such worlds\r\nwas agonizing to imagine.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSomehow, the oddity of talking to a tree wore off. Kolin heard opinions\r\nspouting out which he had prudently kept bottled up for years.\r\n\r\nThe more he talked and stormed and complained, the more relaxed he felt.\r\n\r\n"If there was ever a fellow ready for this planet," decided the tree\r\nnamed Ashlew, "you\'re it, Sonny! Hang on there while I signal the Life\r\nby root!"\r\n\r\nKolin sensed a lack of direct attention. The rustle about him was\r\nnatural, caused by an ordinary breeze. He noticed his hands shaking.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t know what got into me, talking that way to a tree," he muttered.\r\n"If Yrtok snapped out of it and heard, I\'m as good as re-personalized\r\nright now."\r\n\r\nAs he brooded upon the sorry choice of arousing a search by hiding where\r\nhe was or going back to bluff things out, the tree spoke.\r\n\r\n"Maybe you\'re all set, Sonny. The Life has been thinkin\' of learning\r\nabout other worlds. If you can think of a safe form to jet off in, you\r\nmight make yourself a deal. How\'d you like to stay here?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said Kolin. "The penalty for desertion--"\r\n\r\n"Whoosh! Who\'d find you? 

=== Chunk 9 ===
You could be a bird, a tree, even a cloud."\r\n\r\nSilenced but doubting, Kolin permitted himself to try the dream on for\r\nsize.\r\n\r\nHe considered what form might most easily escape the notice of search\r\nparties and still be tough enough to live a long time without renewal.\r\nAnother factor slipped into his musings: mere hope of escape was\r\nunsatisfying after the outburst that had defined his fuming hatred for\r\nHaurtoz.\r\n\r\n_I\'d better watch myself!_ he thought. _Don\'t drop diamonds to grab at\r\nstars!_\r\n\r\n"What I wish I could do is not just get away but get even for the way\r\nthey make us live ... the whole damn set-up. They could just as easy\r\nmake peace with the Earth colonies. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
You know why they don\'t?"\r\n\r\n"Why?" wheezed Ashlew.\r\n\r\n"They\'re scared that without talk of war, and scouting for Earth fleets\r\nthat never come, people would have time to think about the way they have\r\nto live and who\'s running things in the Planetary State. Then the gravy\r\ntrain would get blown up--and I mean blown up!"\r\n\r\nThe tree was silent for a moment. Kolin felt the branches stir\r\nmeditatively. Then Ashlew offered a suggestion.\r\n\r\n"I could tell the Life your side of it," he hissed. "Once in with us,\r\nyou can always make thinking connections, no matter how far away. Maybe\r\nyou could make a deal to kill two birds with one stone, as they used to\r\nsay on Earth...."\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChief Steward Slichow paced up and down beside the ration crate turned\r\nup to serve him as a field desk. He scowled in turn, impartially, at his\r\nwatch and at the weary stewards of his headquarters detail. The latter\r\nstumbled about, stacking and distributing small packets of emergency\r\nrations.\r\n\r\nThe line of crewmen released temporarily from repair work was transient\r\nas to individuals but immutable as to length. Slichow muttered something\r\nprofane about disregard of orders as he glared at the rocky ridges\r\nsurrounding the landing place.\r\n\r\nHe was so intent upon planning greetings with which to favor the tardy\r\nscouting parties that he failed to notice the loose cloud drifting over\r\nthe ridge.\r\n\r\nIt was tenuous, almost a haze. Close examination would have revealed it\r\nto be made up of myriads of tiny spores. They resembled those cast forth\r\nby one of the bushes Kolin\'s party had passed. Along the edges, the haze\r\nfaded raggedly into thin air, but the units evidently formed a cohesive\r\nbody. They drifted together, approaching the men as if taking\r\nintelligent advantage of the breeze.\r\n\r\nOne of Chief Slichow\'s staggering flunkies, stealing a few seconds of\r\nrelaxation on the pretext of dumping an armful of light plastic packing,\r\nwandered into the haze.\r\n\r\nHe froze.\r\n\r\nAfter a few heartbeats, he dropped the trash and stared at ship and men\r\nas if he had never seen either. A hail from his master moved him.\r\n\r\n"Coming, Chief!" he called but, returning at a moderate pace, he\r\nmurmured, "My name is Frazer. I\'m a second assistant steward. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
I\'ll think\r\nas Unit One."\r\n\r\nThroughout the cloud of spores, the mind formerly known as Peter Kolin\r\ncongratulated itself upon its choice of form.\r\n\r\n_Nearer to the original shape of the Life than Ashlew got_, he thought.\r\n\r\nHe paused to consider the state of the tree named Ashlew, half immortal\r\nbut rooted to one spot, unable to float on a breeze or through space\r\nitself on the pressure of light. Especially, it was unable to insinuate\r\nany part of itself into the control center of another form of life, as a\r\nsecond spore was taking charge of the body of Chief Slichow at that very\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\n_There are not enough men_, thought Kolin. _Some of me must drift\r\nthrough the airlock. In space, I can spread through the air system to\r\nthe command group._\r\n\r\nRepairs to the _Peace State_ and the return to Haurtoz passed like weeks\r\nto some of the crew but like brief moments in infinity to other units.\r\nAt last, the ship parted the air above Headquarters City and landed.\r\n\r\nThe unit known as Captain Theodor Kessel hesitated before descending the\r\nramp. He surveyed the field, the city and the waiting team of inspecting\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\n"Could hardly be better, could it?" he chuckled to the companion unit\r\ncalled Security Officer Tarth.\r\n\r\n"Hardly, sir. All ready for the liberation of Haurtoz."\r\n\r\n"Reformation of the Planetary State," mused the captain, smiling\r\ndreamily as he grasped the handrail. "And then--formation of the\r\nPlanetary Mind!"\r\n\r\n\r\nEND\r\n\r\n\r\n  [ Transcriber\'s Note:\r\n    This e-text was produced from Worlds of If January 1962.
