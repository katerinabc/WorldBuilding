What cosmic\r\n          joke made them drop their weapons and die laughing?\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n                     Planet Stories January 1951.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.

]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rockets started almost simultaneously. From two widely separated\r\npoints on the great curving surface of Earth they reached upward and\r\noutward--toward the Moon.\r\n\r\nIt wasn\'t really so strange a coincidence. Space navigation is governed\r\nby mathematics and logic, not politics. The fact that man-carrying\r\nspaceships happened to be developed concurrently on two sides of an\r\niron curtain meant little to the Universe. It happened, that\'s all. And\r\nthere is a proper time to launch such missiles. When that time came,\r\nthey were launched.\r\n\r\nIn a manner of speaking it was a race. A race wherein the prizes\r\nwere such things as: "gravity gauge" and "surveillance point" and\r\n"impregnable launching sites." The contestants were earnest, capable\r\nmen; each certain that the Moon must not fall into the hands of\r\nthe opponent. It made a stirring and patriotic picture, vivid with\r\nnationalistic fervor. It was thrilling with its taste of high adventure\r\nand self-sacrifice. For each rocket pilot it was a personal crusade\r\nagainst the thing he had been raised to regard as _the enemy_....\r\n\r\nBut somehow under the steady, cold scrutiny of the eternal stars,\r\nthey must have looked a little ridiculous ... perhaps just a tiny bit\r\ntragic, too.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHarsh was the moon. There was black and there was white. Great jagged\r\ncliffs and razor-backed mountains slashed the pocked surface of the\r\ncrater floor, humping themselves at the huge unwinking stars. The sun\r\nwas a stark disc of fire, incredibly white, hung in the black sky. The\r\nshadows were bottomless pools. Within them there was nothing. In the\r\nsunlight, the pumice soil glared white.\r\n\r\nThe Russian rocket had crashed on landing. Randick could see the tiny,\r\nbuckled shape of it high on the mountain. No doubt the pilot was dead,\r\nbut he had to be sure. The risks were too great for any unsupported\r\nassumptions. He had to go up there and see for himself.\r\n\r\nPonderous in his pressure suit, Randick emerged from the open lock of\r\nthe Anglo-American rocket. He slogged across the pumice of the crater\r\nfloor toward the spot where the mountain\'s sheer talus erupted skyward.\r\nIf there were no trouble from the Russki, he would return to his own\r\nship and begin setting up the first cell of what would soon be the\r\nAnglo-American Moon Base. As soon as he signalled a safe landing and\r\nno opposition from the Russian, other rockets would come to add their\r\ncells, and presently there would be an atomic rocket pointed dead at\r\nthe heart of every Russian population center. A rocket each for Moscow,\r\nLeningrad, Kiev, Vladivostok....\r\n\r\nRandick frowned. It would be a lot simpler if the crash had finished\r\nthe Russian pilot. He knew the Russians had exactly the same plan for\r\nthe Moon. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Only the rockets would be aimed at Washington, London, Paris,\r\nSan Francisco. The slight weight of the one-man bazooka on Randick\'s\r\nback seemed suddenly very comforting.\r\n\r\nRandick knew himself to be on the very edge of known territory. His map\r\nshowed him that he was in the highest part of the Doerfel Mountains.\r\nBehind him lay the two great bowls of Bailly and Schickard, and far to\r\nthe north he could see, as he climbed higher, the smooth surface of the\r\nMare Humorum. He looked up to the spinelike ridge beyond and slightly\r\nabove the wreck of the Russian ship. There was a deep pass that slashed\r\nlike a wound into the backbone of the range. He felt a slight thrill.\r\nBeyond that cleft lay ... mystery. The other side of the Moon.\r\n\r\nThe sun\'s rays beat down brutally. Even through the heavily insulated\r\nsuit Randick could feel their searing touch. All around him stretched\r\na jumbled nightmare of black and white. He was suddenly very glad\r\nthat he could not see the Earth in the sky. The homesickness would be\r\nunbearable.\r\n\r\nRandick found himself frowning. He had no time for such thoughts.\r\nHe was a soldier. He reminded himself that up there in the tangled\r\nwreckage of the Russian spaceship there might be another soldier, ready\r\nto kill him. Two human beings on the Moon. Each eager to kill. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Randick\r\nshook his head angrily. He had no right to let his mind dwell on such\r\nthings....\r\n\r\nHe was within a hundred yards of the wreck when a streak of fire and a\r\nsoundless blast drove him into the shadows. Pumice showered him from\r\nthe starshaped depression where the explosive missile had struck.\r\nRandick cursed heartily. The Russki was very much alive, and there\r\nwasn\'t a thing wrong with his eyesight. The shot had been uncomfortably\r\nclose.\r\n\r\nUnslinging his bazooka, Randick began to work his way around behind the\r\nRussian rocket. A slight movement among the wreckage caught his trained\r\neye and he launched a projectile at it. It flared wickedly, tearing\r\nfragments of metal loose and flinging them fantastic distances down the\r\nsheer slope of the ridge. There was no return fire.\r\n\r\nRandick broke out of the shadow and ran for the cover of a large\r\npumicestone boulder farther up the draw. A sun-bright flash of fire\r\nspattered the loose soil a dozen feet from him. He slid for the\r\ndarkness on his belly. That one had been a near thing!\r\n\r\nBehind the boulder lay a trench-like depression that sloped away up\r\nthe draw toward the pass. Randick dropped into it and began to crawl\r\nlaboriously upward. If he could flank the Russki he could finish this\r\nwith one good shot. Another explosion rocked the boulder he had just\r\nleft. Randick didn\'t even look back.\r\n\r\nHe felt his breath rasping in his throat and his body felt hot and\r\nsticky inside the bulky pressure suit. Glancing down and to his right,\r\nhe could see the proudly erect shape of his own rocket far below on the\r\nfloor of the crater.\r\n\r\nIt took him almost thirty minutes to reach the edge of the shadow that\r\nspilled from the side of the mountain pass. To his left, not ten feet\r\naway, was the sudden white glare of the pumice floor. He was well above\r\nand almost behind the wreck of the Russian\'s ship. His flanks were\r\nheaving with the exertion of the climb as he searched the buckled mass\r\nof the crash for his opponent.\r\n\r\nThere seemed to be a dark shape wedged in between two twisted\r\nbulkheads. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
It looked like a man. With pounding heart, Randick murmured\r\na prayer and lifted his bazooka, aimed, and pressed the firing stud.\r\nThe shadow vanished in silent white fire.\r\n\r\nThe return blast almost knocked him down. For a moment Randick was\r\nstunned, wondering foggily where the shot had come from. Then his brain\r\ncleared and he realized that the Russki too had climbed to the pass,\r\nleaving Randick to fire at shadows.\r\n\r\nRandick cursed himself for his dangerous stupidity. The other must be\r\namong those shadowy rocks directly across the bright floor of the pass.\r\nHe raised his bazooka carefully, searching the Stygian blackness for\r\nsome sign of movement. His finger curled around the firing stud....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOut of the corner of his eye he saw the flare. The Russian rocket\r\nerupted in a gout of bluish flame and the whole mountain seemed to\r\nrock. Randick stared stupidly at the glowing crater where the ship\r\nhad been. For just an instant he thought that perhaps a meteorite had\r\nstruck it, but the explosion had been unquestionably ... atomic.\r\n\r\nThe Russian must have been stunned, too. For he moved out into the\r\nlight, empty-handed, his helmet turned woodenly toward the rapidly\r\ncooling lake of magma where his space ship had been.\r\n\r\nThey both saw the bright arc of fire that raced up from beyond the\r\nridge and curved down gracefully toward the floor of the crater far\r\nbelow. Openmouthed, Randick watched his ship vanish into flame and he\r\nfelt the vague tremor of the ground under him as the shock rumbled\r\nacross the face of the Moon.\r\n\r\nThe Russian rocket was gone. The Anglo-American rocket was gone.\r\nMoon Base was gone before it had ever been.\r\n\r\nThe weapon fell from Randick\'s hand, and he stepped unsteadily into the\r\nlight toward the Russian. Suddenly human companionship was very, very\r\nimportant. Panicky terror was plucking at his throat.\r\n\r\nThe two men stumbled toward each other across the pass cut deep into\r\nthe jagged back of the Doerfel mountains. As one they turned and looked\r\nout across the vast expanse of the Moon\'s hidden face.\r\n\r\nThey were soldiers. They knew an invasion base when they saw one. As\r\nfar as the eye could see, lines of sleek mammoth spaceships of unknown\r\ndesign stretched away into the distance. The face of the vast unnamed\r\n_mare_ was covered with them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Their sides hurt with laughter, tears rolled down their\r\nfaces....]\r\n\r\nSuddenly Randick felt himself beginning to giggle. He tried to stop,\r\nbut the laughter welled up inside of him, echoing wildly within his\r\nconfining helmet. He could see that the Russian was laughing too, white\r\nteeth gleaming behind the plexiglass faceplate. They laughed until they\r\ngasped. Their sides hurt with laughter, tears rolled down their faces.\r\nThey were arm in arm and still laughing when the third rocket arced\r\ndown on them from out of the black and star-flecked sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
