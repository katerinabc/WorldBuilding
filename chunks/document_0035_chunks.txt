Herein\r\n may lie the reason._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Smiler\r\n\r\nBy Albert Hernhunter\r\n\r\n\r\n"Your name?"\r\n\r\n"Cole. Martin Cole."\r\n\r\n"Your profession?"\r\n\r\n"A very important one. I am a literary agent specializing in science\r\nfiction. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
I sell the work of various authors to magazine and book\r\npublishers."\r\n\r\nThe Coroner paused to study Cole; to ponder the thin, mirthless smile.\r\nThe Coroner said, "Mr. Cole, this inquest has been called to look into\r\nthe death of one Sanford Smith, who was found near your home with a gun\r\nin his hand and a bullet in his brain. The theory of suicide has been--"\r\n\r\n"--rather hard to rationalize?"\r\n\r\nThe Coroner blinked. "You could put it that way.

=== Chunk 3 ===
"\r\n\r\n"I would put it even stronger. The theory is obviously ridiculous. It\r\nwas a weak cover-up. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
The best I could do under the circumstances."\r\n\r\n"You are saying that you killed Sanford Smith?"\r\n\r\n"Of course."\r\n\r\nThe Coroner glanced at his six-man jury, at the two police officers, at\r\nthe scattering of spectators. They all seemed stunned. Even the reporter\r\nsent to cover the hearing made no move toward the telephone. The Coroner\r\ncould think of only the obvious question: "Why did you kill him?"\r\n\r\n"He was dangerous to us."\r\n\r\n"Whom do you mean by _us_?"\r\n\r\n"We Martians, who plan to take over your world."\r\n\r\nThe Coroner was disappointed. A lunatic. But a lunatic can murder. Best\r\nto proceed, the Coroner thought. "I was not aware that we have Martians\r\nto contend with."\r\n\r\n"If I\'d had the right weapon to use on Smith, you wouldn\'t be aware of\r\nit now. We still exercise caution."\r\n\r\nThe Coroner felt a certain pity. "Why did you kill Smith?"\r\n\r\n"We Martians have found science-fiction writers to be our greatest\r\ndanger. Through the medium of imaginative fiction, such writers have\r\nmore than once revealed our plans. If the public suddenly realized\r\nthat--"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Coroner broke in. "You killed Smith because he revealed something in\r\nhis writings?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. He refused to take my word that it was unsalable. He threatened to\r\nsubmit it direct. It was vital material."\r\n\r\n"But there are many other such writers. You can\'t control--"\r\n\r\n"We control ninety percent of the output. We have concentrated on the\r\nfield and all of the science-fiction agencies are in our hands. This\r\ncontrol was imperative.

"\r\n\r\n"I see." The Coroner spoke in the gentle tones one uses with the insane.\r\n"Any writing dangerous to your cause is deleted or changed by the\r\nagents."\r\n\r\n"Not exactly. The agent usually persuades the writer to make any such\r\nchanges, as the agent is considered an authority on what will or will\r\nnot sell."\r\n\r\n"The writers always agree?"\r\n\r\n"Not always. If stubbornness is encountered, the agent merely shelves\r\nthe manuscript and tells the writer it has been repeatedly rejected."\r\n\r\nThe Coroner glanced at the two policemen. Both were obviously puzzled.\r\nThey returned the Coroner\'s look, apparently ready to move on his order.\r\n\r\nThe thin, mirthless smile was still on Cole\'s lips. Maniacal violence\r\ncould lie just behind it. Possibly Cole was armed. Better to play for\r\ntime--try to quiet the madness within. The Coroner continued speaking.\r\n"You Martians have infiltrated other fields also?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. We are in government, industry, education. We are everywhere.\r\nWe have, of course, concentrated mainly upon the ranks of labor and in\r\nthe masses of ordinary, everyday people. It is from these sources that\r\nwe will draw our shock troops when the time comes."\r\n\r\n"That time will be--?"\r\n\r\n"Soon, very soon."\r\n\r\nThe Coroner could not forebear a smile. "You find the science-fiction\r\nwriters more dangerous than the true scientists?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. The scientific mind tends to reject anything science\r\ndisproves." There was now a mocking edge to Cole\'s voice. "Science can\r\neasily prove we do not exist."\r\n\r\n"But the science-fiction writer?"\r\n\r\n"The danger from the imaginative mind cannot be overestimated."\r\n\r\nThe Coroner knew he must soon order the officers to lay hands upon this\r\nmadman. He regretted his own lack of experience with such situations. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
He\r\ntried to put a soothing, confidential note into his voice. "You said a\r\nmoment ago that if you\'d had the right kind of weapon to use on Smith--"\r\n\r\nCole reached into his pocket and brought out what appeared to be a\r\nfountain pen. "This. It kills instantly and leaves no mark whatever.\r\nHeart failure is invariably stated as the cause of death."\r\n\r\nThe Coroner felt better. Obviously, Cole was not armed. As the Coroner\r\nraised a hand to signal the officers, Cole said, "You understand, of\r\ncourse, that I can\'t let you live."\r\n\r\n"Take this man into custody."\r\n\r\nThe police officers did not move. The Coroner turned on them sharply.\r\nThey were smiling. Cole pointed the fountain pen. The Coroner felt a\r\nsharp chill on his flesh. He looked at the jury, at the newspaperman,\r\nthe spectators. They were all smiling cold, thin, terrible smiles....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA short time later, the newspaperman phoned in his story. The afternoon\r\neditions carried it:\r\n\r\n                     CORONER BELL DIES OF HEART ATTACK\r\n\r\n    Shortly after this morning\'s inquest, which resulted in a jury\r\n    verdict of suicide in the case of Sanford Smith, Coroner James Bell\r\n    dropped dead of heart failure in the hearing room of the County\r\n    building.
