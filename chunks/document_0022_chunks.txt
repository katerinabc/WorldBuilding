The youngster was frightened.\r\n\r\n"Dark, very dark, and big. It moves fast, but we\'ll keep up with it."\r\nThe tone was consciously reassuring.\r\n\r\n"Dark, Grandpa?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, it sucks heat and absorbs light. You\'ll find out when you\'re old\r\nand strong enough to swim down to the bottom and see what\'s there. Now\r\nstay with me when we follow it, and don\'t get lost in the crowd; and\r\ndon\'t get ahead of me or get too close to it--you might take in too\r\nmuch, and get overcharged."\r\n\r\n"What\'s \'overcharged,\' Grandpa? Can you really get too much?" The\r\nyoungster jigged up and down a little with excitement and\r\nanticipation.\r\n\r\nFor a moment, the oldster turned his attention from watching for the\r\nthing that was coming, and considered him fondly. "Poor youngling. I\r\nforget. You\'ve had no chance to learn what it means to get enough.\r\nYou\'re too young to ride the storms and tap the lightnings.... Listen\r\nnow. When a grownup has to let out a flash of blue light, that means\r\nthat he\'s overcharged and spinning off balance inside, and so he has\r\nto save himself by letting out his energy to let down the pressure. So\r\nbe careful; take enough, but don\'t be greedy and take in too much too\r\nsuddenly. Now let\'s just float here with the others and be ready.

"\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful bright day. The sun poured down its flood of light,\r\nhere and there energizing a molecule of the blue air into little\r\nsparkles of ionization; and below, a mist of bright clouds half veiled\r\nthe darkness that was the bottom.\r\n\r\n"What\'s it mean when someone blinks blue light in lots of flashes, and\r\nthen glows red and starts sinking, huh, Grandpa?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you later when you\'re older.

Just be careful and don\'t get\r\ntoo close." He was abruptly excited. "Here it comes!"\r\n\r\nOut of the blue translucence far below, a black dot appeared and grew\r\nrapidly, rushing closer until it was a huge fish-shaped object with\r\nwidespread fins, rushing towards them. It would pass slightly to the\r\nleft of them, and already the waiting crowd was moving to intercept\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIt flashed by, and the youngster thought they were going to lose\r\nit--it was going so much faster than they; but as the thought crossed\r\nhis mind, and he saw the two churning glowing openings in its rear, a\r\nburning blast of energy struck him. A multitude of glowing, charged\r\nparticles crackled around him, streamed against him. His fields\r\nshifted to reach out and capture them; the spin of stored energy\r\nwithin spun faster, absorbing the new energy into its drive, its\r\nlife-pulse rising to a deep hum, and he felt strong, stronger than he\r\nhad ever felt before in his life.\r\n\r\nThey were flying faster now, accelerating faster than he had ever\r\nflown, and it was easy. They drew up closer to the dark thing,\r\nmatching it speed for speed, laving in the glowing cloud of\r\nenergy-particles that roared backward from its jets. The youngster was\r\nastounded and exhilarated at the tremendous, effortless speed with\r\nwhich they were driving forward. This was the first time he had ever\r\nhad so much power. It was ten times more than any aurora borealis with\r\nits pale wash of energy waves.\r\n\r\nDrunken in his new found strength, he pulled ahead closer to the\r\nroaring jets.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the peak of the arc of climb of the New York-Istanbul stratoliner,\r\nhigh in the ionosphere where the Earth was merely a giant globe far\r\nbelow, the pilot of the stratoliner boredly cut the jets for the\r\nfuel-saving glide that turned their nose toward Earth again.\r\n\r\nThe radar was clanging its usual senseless warning of imminent\r\ncollision with some solid objects, which had approached closer than\r\nthe automatic relays considered safe. It had been clanging for several\r\nminutes. The pilot glanced in annoyance at the radar screen, where\r\nseveral hundred globes--from two to seven feet in diameter--showed\r\nvividly, trailing the ship in a fan-shaped cluster. "Some day I\'m\r\ngoing to take a hammer to that thing."\r\n\r\nThe co-pilot, looking back from the control blister\'s rear window, saw\r\nnothing, as usual, except a few of the shining globes, which showed\r\nthemselves transiently in a brief flash of blue light as they\r\ncarelessly overloaded and discharged--and one, smaller than the rest,\r\nwho blinked on and off rapidly in brilliant flashes of blue. As he\r\nwatched, it ran suddenly down the color-scale to red and began to lag\r\nbehind, a glowing red globe, sinking.\r\n\r\n"I wonder what the hell they think they\'re doing?" he grumbled.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
