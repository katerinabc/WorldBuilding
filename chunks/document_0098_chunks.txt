The human race, for instance--\r\n\r\n\r\nThe condensation of the histories of ten thousand races into a text\r\nconcise enough to fit into a single volume had been a task of\r\nunprecedented proportions. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
There had been times when the Galactic\r\nHistorian had doubted whether even his renowned abilities were up to the\r\nassignment that the Galactic Board of Education had so lightly tossed\r\nhis way, times when he had thrown up his hands--all five of them--in\r\ndespair. But at last the completed manuscript lay before him on his desk\r\nwith nothing but the final reading remaining between it and publication.\r\n\r\nThe Galactic Historian repeatedly wiped his brows as he turned the\r\npages. It was a warm night, even for Mixxx Seven. Now and then, a tired\r\nbreeze struggled down from the hills and limped across the lowlands to\r\nthe Galactic University buildings. It crept into the Galactic\r\nHistorian's study via the open door and out again via the open windows,\r\nfingering the manuscript each time it passed but doing nothing\r\nwhatsoever about the temperature.\r\n\r\nThe manuscript was something more than a hammered-down history of\r\ngalactic achievement. It was the ultimate document. The two and seventy\r\nthousand jarring texts that it summarized had been systematically\r\ndestroyed, one by one, after the Galactic Historian had stripped them of\r\ntheir objective information. If an historical event was not included in\r\nthe manuscript, it failed as an event. It ceased to have reality.\r\n\r\nThe responsibility was the Galactic Historian's alone and he did not\r\ntake it lightly. But he had a lot on his minds and, of late, he hadn't\r\nbeen sleeping well. He was overworked and over-tired and over-anxious.\r\nHe hadn't seen his wives for two Mixxx months and he was worried about\r\nthem--all fifty of them.\r\n\r\nHe never should have let them take the Hub cruise in the first place.\r\nBut they'd been so enthusiastic and so eager that he simply hadn't had\r\nthe hearts to let them down. Now, despite his better judgments, he was\r\nbeginning to wonder if they might not be on the make for another\r\ncoordinator.\r\n\r\nWives trouble, on top of all his chronological trouble, was too much.\r\nThe Galactic Historian could hardly be blamed for wanting to see the\r\nlast of the manuscript, for wanting to transmit it to his publishers,\r\npotential hiatuses and all, and take the next warp for the Hub.\r\n\r\nBut he was an historian--_the_ historian, in fact--and he persisted\r\nheroically in his task, rereading stale paragraphs and checking dreary\r\ndates, going over battles and conquests and invasions and interregnums.\r\nDespite his mood and despite the heat, the manuscript probably would\r\nhave arrived at his publishers chronologically complete. So complete, in\r\nfact, that schoolteachers all over the galaxy would have gotten the\r\ntextbook they had always wanted--a concise chronicle of everything that\r\nhad ever happened since the explosion of the primeval atom, a history\r\ntextbook that no other history textbook could contradict for the simple\r\nreason that there were no other history textbooks.\r\n\r\nAs it was, they got the textbook, but it did not contain everything that\r\nhad ever happened. Not quite.\r\n\r\nTwo factors were responsible for the omission. The first was an\r\noversight on the part of the Galactic Historian. With so much on his\r\nminds, he had forgotten to number the pages of the manuscript.\r\n\r\nThe second factor was the breeze.\r\n\r\nThe breeze was the ultimate archfiend and there can be no question as to\r\nits motivation. Nothing short of sheer malice could have caused it\r\nsuddenly to remember its function after neglecting that function all\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nAll evening it had been tiptoeing down the hillsides and across the\r\nlowlands as though it was afraid of disturbing a single blade of grass\r\nor a single drooping leaf. And then, at the crucial moment, it huffed\r\nand puffed itself up into a little hurricane, charged down upon the\r\nGalactic University buildings and whooshed through the Galactic\r\nHistorian's study like a band of interstellar dervishes.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the Galactic Historian had begun to wipe his brows at the\r\nvery moment of the breeze's entry. While the act was not a complicated\r\none, it did consume time and monopolize attention. It is not surprising,\r\ntherefore, that he failed to witness the theft. Neither is it surprising\r\nthat he failed to notice afterwards that the page he had been checking\r\nwas gone.\r\n\r\nHe was, as previously stated, overworked, over-tired, and over-anxious\r\nand, in such a state, even a Galactic Historian can skip a whole series\r\nof words and dates and never know the difference. A hiatus of twenty\r\nthousand years is hardly noticeable anyway. Galactically speaking,\r\ntwenty thousand years is a mere wink in time.\r\n\r\nThe breeze didn't carry the page very far. It simply whisked it through\r\na convenient window, deposited it beneath a xixxix tree and then\r\nreturned to the hills to rest. But the choice of a xixxix tree is highly\r\nsignificant and substantiates the malicious nature of the breeze's act.\r\nIf it had chosen a muu or a buxx tree instead, the Galactic Historian\r\nmight have found the page in the morning when he took his constitutional\r\nthrough the university grounds.\r\n\r\nHowever, since a xixxix tree was selected, no doubt whatever can remain\r\nas to the breeze's basic motivation. Articles of a valuable nature just\r\naren't left beneath xixxix trees. Everybody knows that squixes live in\r\nxixxix trees and everybody knows that squixes are collectors. They\r\ncollect all sorts of things, buttons and pins and twigs and\r\npebbles--anything at all, in fact, that isn't too big for them to pick\r\nup and carry into their xixxix tree houses.\r\n\r\nThey have been called less kind things than collectors. Thieves, for\r\nexample, and scavengers. But collectors are what they really are.\r\nCollecting fulfills a basic need in their mammalian makeup; the\r\npossession of articles gives them a feeling of security. They love to\r\nsurround their little furry bodies with all sorts of odds and ends, and\r\ntheir little arboreal houses are stuffed with everything you can think\r\nof.\r\n\r\nAnd they simply adore paper. They adore it because it has a practical as\r\nwell as a cultural value.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, they adore it because it is wonderful to make hammocks out\r\nof.\r\n\r\nWhen the two squixes in the xixxix tree saw the page drift to the\r\nground, they could hardly believe their eyes. They chittered excitedly\r\nas they skittered down the trunk. The page had hardly stopped fluttering\r\nbefore it was whisked aloft again, clenched in tiny squix fingers.\r\n\r\nThe squixes wasted no time. It had been a long while since the most\r\ncherished of all collector's items had come their way and they needed a\r\nnew hammock badly. First, they tore the page into strips, then they\r\nbegan to weave the strips together.\r\n\r\n_--1456, Gut. Bi.

; Hist. E., end of._\r\n\r\nIt was a fine hammock, the best the two squixes had ever wove. But they\r\ndidn't sleep well that night. They twisted and turned and tossed, and\r\nthey dreamed the most fantastic dreams--\r\n\r\nWhich isn't particularly surprising, considering what they were sleeping\r\non.
