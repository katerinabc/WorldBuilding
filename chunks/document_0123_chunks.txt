In the middle of the night the big ship\r\nhad landed on the new planet, the satellite of the sun Proxima. Now\r\nthey sat in the dark waiting, and they talked.\r\n\r\n"I wish we hadn\'t killed them," Rossiter said softly. His profile was\r\nfaintly visible against the diffused light of the stars. "It\'s a bad\r\nsign, a bad start for a new life."\r\n\r\n"They attacked us," Bernard answered quickly.\r\n\r\n"Two spears, against forty blasters and stun guns?" Rossiter laughed.\r\n"An attack! We should have met them with stunners at low charge. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
But\r\nMcNess ordered us to blast. The woman and the baby stick in my craw."\r\n\r\n"All our nerves were on edge," Bernard answered thoughtfully. "I know I\r\nwas afraid when we first stepped out of the ship. There was something\r\nterrifying about air, and space, and the sky. But you\'re right, of\r\ncourse. We shouldn\'t have been ordered to blast." The two men were\r\nsitting a little apart, but there was a murmur of many low voices\r\naround them as the others from the _Elpis_ waited and talked.\r\n\r\n"I wonder why they attacked us?" Bernard went on. "Primitives usually\r\nrun. We must have been an unbelievable sight to them, spiraling down\r\nout of the sky."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," Rossiter replied wearily. "And we can\'t ask them.\r\nThey\'re dead, all five of them. That wind\'s cold." He was shivering.\r\n\r\n"You could go back inside the ship," Bernard said half-humorously.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sick of the _Elpis_. We all are. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Eight years of it--it\'s too much.\r\nWe\'ll get used to the wind, I suppose. There\'s going to be lots of\r\nwind, with so much water and only this one land mass on our new world.\r\nIt\'s not like Earth."\r\n\r\nBernard made an involuntary movement. Then he relaxed. "I suppose the\r\ntaboo is lifted now that we\'ve landed," he said heavily. "We can talk\r\nabout Earth again, and wonder, and speculate. I wonder what they\'re\r\ndoing now on Earth."\r\n\r\n"Starving. Freezing. Burrowing into the ground for coal and warmth.\r\nThey must be living a good many hundred feet down now, those that are\r\nleft. And the seas are frozen. There\'s an ice sheet from pole to pole.\r\n\r\n"We astronomers paid you back finely, didn\'t we, Bernard, for all\r\nthe appropriations you got us in committee meeting. You were always\r\ngenerous with us and the physicists. But when the catastrophe happened,\r\nthe mystery, the debacle, we couldn\'t help. We didn\'t know the answer.\r\nWe didn\'t know."\r\n\r\n"I remember--" Bernard answered, choking a little, "--I remember the\r\nday before it happened. There was a report on my desk about some tribe\r\nof Indians high in the Andes. The report said that the parents had been\r\npersuaded to send their children to the school in the foothills, that\r\neven among the adults illiteracy and ignorance were being eliminated.\r\nIt was the last of the ignorant tribes.\r\n\r\n"I looked up at the sign over my desk and read the motto, \'There\r\nis nothing unknowable. There are only things not yet known,\' and I\r\nthought, \'Yes, we\'re getting near our goal. We\'ve conquered ignorance\r\nand superstition and illiteracy. And as time goes on we\'ll know more\r\nand more things. The area of the unknown will constantly diminish.\r\nKnowledge is like an expanding circle of light that eats into the\r\ndarkness.\' Then the darkness came. And you didn\'t know."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"We know what happened well enough," Rossiter corrected. He sounded\r\nolder than his fifty-two years. "I was at the observatory that night.\r\nI remember thinking that it was almost time for me to go to the\r\ndormitory to sleep. It was summer; Sirius and the sun would both soon\r\nbe up. Sirius rose, blazing in the darkness, and after him Leo, in the\r\nsoutheast. It should have been invisible in the sunlight. I couldn\'t\r\nbelieve what I saw. And still the sun didn\'t come up.\r\n\r\n"We know what happened in a way. We don\'t know how or why. The sun, our\r\nsun, never rose. The sun just disappeared."\r\n\r\n"How softly everyone\'s speaking," Bernard said irrelevantly. "It\'s the\r\nsky and the darkness. I could hardly hear you." He got to his feet.\r\n\r\n"Where are you going, Tom?" Rossiter asked.\r\n\r\n"I want to look at the bodies. The people we blasted, I mean."\r\n\r\n"That\'s morbid. Don\'t go, Tom. Stay here."\r\n\r\n"But I want to go. I\'ll be back." He moved away through the dimly\r\nvisible outlines of men and women seated on the ground.\r\n\r\nHe came back after a while and sat down by his friend in silence. "I\r\nthink I know why they attacked us," he said after a pause.\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"I think we interrupted some magical or religious rite. They were at\r\na very low level of material culture, of course. The points on the\r\nspears were stone, and they were wearing garments of what looked like\r\nsome sort of tree bark. Not woven cloth. But the young men were wearing\r\nrattles of some sort of shell around their ankles, and the old man was\r\nholding a little drum in his hands.\r\n\r\n"You see, they had a good cranial capacity. As soon as human beings can\r\nthink at all, they start trying to impose their will on the universe.\r\nI think they met here by the shore to perform some sort of magic. The\r\nwoman and the baby watched, the old man played his drum, the two young\r\nmen sang and danced. Perhaps this bit of the coast was sacred to them.\r\nPerhaps, when we set our ship down here, we profaned a sacred place."\r\n\r\n"The woman and the baby bother me," Rossiter said thoughtfully. "It\r\nseems a dreadful thing to me to kill a woman. Ever since Kate died...."\r\n\r\nBernard rested his hand for a moment on the older man\'s shoulder in\r\nsympathy. "It was wrong. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
We shouldn\'t have done it," he responded. "But\r\nwe must forget it. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Tomorrow, when it\'s light, we\'ll bury them."\r\n\r\n"I wonder if they were the only humanoid life on the planet," Rossiter\r\nsaid, pursuing his own train of thought "This island was the only land\r\nmass we found anywhere. If those five, so few.... When we blasted them,\r\ndid we wipe out the planet\'s native humanoid life?"\r\n\r\n"Possibly," Bernard admitted uneasily. He cleared his throat. "If they\r\nhadn\'t attacked us we could have helped them. They were primitive,\r\nsuperstitious, blankly ignorant, of course. But they had good\r\nskulls. They could have learned. We\'d have taught them, as we did\r\nthe primitives on Earth. We\'d have led them gently away from their\r\nsuperstition and ignorance. As we did on Earth. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Let\'s not talk about it\r\nany more."\r\n\r\nRossiter made a sort of noise. Bernard leaned forward quickly. "What\'s\r\nthe matter, Dick? 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Are you all right?"\r\n\r\n"I--what you said--" Rossiter seemed to grope for words. "Be quiet a\r\nminute, Tom. I want to think. What you said then--I--it--" He laid his\r\nhands over his eyes.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll get Dr. Ferguson," Bernard offered.\r\n\r\n"No, I\'m all right." Once more he fumbled for words. "I\'ve suddenly\r\ncome to understand. You made me understand--_as we did on Earth_."\r\n\r\n"What--"\r\n\r\nRossiter got to his feet. In his normal voice, which sounded very loud\r\nin the darkness, he said, "I know what made the sun go out."\r\n\r\nThe murmur of low talking ceased suddenly. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
There was a sense of\r\nlistening, of half-seen bodies leaning forward intently in the\r\nstarlight. Rossiter said, "On Earth there was always somebody dancing."\r\n\r\n"Dancing? I don\'t see--" Bernard spoke in wonderment, but there was an\r\nodd, apprehensive note in his voice.\r\n\r\n"There was always somebody dancing," said Rossiter. He halted. Then he\r\ncontinued in a stronger voice, "Always, in the high mountains there was\r\nsomebody fasting and praying. Always before dawn there was the sound of\r\nthe rattles and the stamping footsteps.\r\n\r\n"In the winter the flame leaped high on the rock through the swirls of\r\nsnow as they made fire magic. They danced. They prayed. They chanted.\r\nAnd the sun came up."\r\n\r\n"What are you trying to say?" Bernard demanded. He had risen and was\r\nstanding facing the older man.\r\n\r\n"That people used to think, before we taught them better, that they had\r\nsomething to do with the sun\'s rising. They grew too wise to believe\r\nit any longer. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
But who knows? Who knows whether they were not right?\r\nWhether the force that impels the stars is not, finally, the human\r\nwill?"\r\n\r\nThere was a silence. Somebody laughed nervously.\r\n\r\nDr. Ferguson had already stepped forward and was holding Rossiter by\r\nthe elbow. Together, he and Bernard urged the older man toward the\r\n_Elpis_. They spoke to him gently. They did not argue or disagree with\r\nhim. They led him inside the ship.\r\n\r\nMuch later Bernard came out alone. Dr. Ferguson had remained with\r\nRossiter, quieting him with sedatives. It was still quite dark.\r\n\r\nBernard looked up at the sky, sighing. "How long the dawn is in\r\ncoming," he said, as if to himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
