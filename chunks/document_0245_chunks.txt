And to each it sounded\r\n             familiar--a sweetheart, a son, a hated enemy!\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Imagination Stories of Science and Fantasy\r\n                             January 1954\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a dwindling spiral they circled the planet, and Murph\'s cold blue\r\neyes studied the radarscreen. Things looked good: no sign of cities,\r\nsocial denizens or humanoids. He was scribbling notes on his desk when\r\nthe all-wave above him started crackling.\r\n\r\nHe watched the green line sweep back and forth along the dial, finally\r\ncentering on the wave length which was broadcasting. As it focused, the\r\nspeaker sputtered in.\r\n\r\n"... in accordance with Interstellar Code," it sounded like a\r\nrecording, "... we repeat. Landings and colonizing efforts have been\r\npreviously attempted upon this planet. They are not welcome and have\r\nnot been successful. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
Change course and seek other areas. This warning\r\nis being broadcast upon wavelengths available to you and in language\r\ntranslatable by you in accordance with Interstellar Code...." Murphy\r\nswitched it off and looked at his crew of two.\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\nForsyth grinned at him. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
"The hell with them! We\'ve heard that from\r\nevery race in the solar system--one way or another. I say we land."\r\n\r\nJamison shrugged. "Put \'er down anywhere. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Makes no difference to me."\r\nHis scarred lips tightened.\r\n\r\n"Okay," Murph switched the set back on. The same record was playing,\r\nmonotonously.\r\n\r\n"Load up with combat equipment, boys. We\'re going in."\r\n\r\nThe deadly silver needle tightened the spiral course around the planet,\r\nand above Murph the speaker crackled again and went dead.\r\n\r\n"Guess they got tired of playing that record," he muttered.\r\n\r\nAnother crackling and the mechanism blared again.\r\n\r\n"... we see you intend disregarding our warning. In accordance with\r\nInterstellar Code, it is only fair to warn you...." It clicked off\r\nabruptly as Murph jabbed at the switch. No use listening to this\r\noutworld nonsense--he\'d heard it all before and lived through it.\r\n\r\n"Where\'s the rest of the fleet?" He threw the question out generally.\r\n\r\n"Nine hours behind," Jamison said. "We blast in. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
They follow us." The\r\nthree men were silent as they scanned the radar screen. They whined\r\nabove a land mass and Murph juggled the controls and the ship swooped\r\nupward, then settled slowly, riding on the jets. While they waited for\r\nthe ground around them to cool, the men climbed into combat gear. The\r\nradar scanned the military hemisphere available and Murph casually\r\nflipped the radio switch again.\r\n\r\n"... have disregarded our warning," the voice said, insistently. "In\r\naccordance with the Interstellar Code, we can not now be further\r\nresponsible...." It croaked into silence as Murph slammed the switch\r\nclosed again.\r\n\r\n"Nuts!" he said, buckling a belt around his waist.\r\n\r\n"Yeah," said Jamison. "The hell with them--whoever they are."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Forsyth--he was the navigator, "now, I\'m not so sure...."\r\n\r\n"Get dressed," Murph was in command, and he showed it. "We are going\r\nout."\r\n\r\n... There was an oddity about the voice, Murph thought, as he dressed.\r\nThe voice reminded him of his sweetheart, Sitra, back in Philly on\r\nearth: husky, throaty--and with the soft, vibrant purr of a happy\r\nkitten.\r\n\r\n... It reminded Forsyth of his son\'s tones, during the family farewell\r\nfor this expedition. A twinge of concern tautened his body as he\r\nremembered: one never knew when--or if--crews returned from these grim\r\nexpansion campaigns of humanity.\r\n\r\n... Jamison had another impression. He remembered his days as a\r\nprofessional fighter and that last, rough brawl when he hadn\'t _quite_\r\nmade champion. It still rankled. The voice was that of his opponent,\r\nin the seventh round--just when Jamison\'s knees started to buckle. The\r\nsly, calculated insults in the clinches, intended to make him lose his\r\nhead. They had accomplished their purpose. He had charged in slugging,\r\nwhen he should have hung on--or run backward until his wind returned.\r\nFrom then on he became a has-been, working steadily downward, until the\r\nmanpower needs of humanity had offered an opportunity to pick another\r\ncareer. His scarred lips, remembering, were a tight line and his eyes\r\ncold and uncompromising.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey\'d finished dressing. Murph flipped on the radio again, grinning in\r\ncontempt. The voice still vibrated through the ether.\r\n\r\n"... that you blast off immediately or assume responsibility for\r\nthe consequences. Interstellar Code states that invaded peoples are\r\njustified in using any tactics...." It clicked off. Murph had been\r\nannoyed by the resemblance to Sitra\'s voice: perhaps he was homesick.\r\nJamison\'s lips vanished into a white line and Forsyth looked around,\r\nrabbit-eyed with astonishment, expecting to see his son emerge from\r\nthe piles of supplies and equipment. Self-conscious, none of them said\r\nanything.\r\n\r\n"Okay," said Murph, "Out we go."\r\n\r\nThe precision door swung open quietly and the three descended to the\r\nstill-smoking ground. Each set up his rapid fire electro-gun, covering\r\nthe entrance and then they sat back, waiting. Nothing happened, and\r\nMurph broke the tense silence.\r\n\r\n"Turn on the radio," he looked at Forsyth. "We can hear it from here.\r\nI\'ll man both guns."\r\n\r\nForsyth grunted and vanished into the ship. Murph heard the crackle\r\nas equipment warmed up, and listened to the voice of Sitra. Oddly\r\nenough, Jamison tensed as he heard the voice of the present champion,\r\nand Forsyth nearly cried as his son\'s tones came through the metallic\r\nspeaker. But all the voices said the same thing.\r\n\r\n"... subject to unprincipled attack to resist invasion of our homeland.\r\nThis is the last time this warning will be broadcast." The receiver\r\nclicked, then dropped into the monotonous hum of a radio on an unused\r\nbut still alert wavelength.\r\n\r\nForsyth returned and the three men sat, each back of an electro-gun,\r\nalert eyes scanning the alien landscape. From over a slight rise a mile\r\noff, a figure approached the ship. Murph blinked, doubting his senses,\r\nconfused, then his roar broke the silence of the strange world.\r\n\r\n"Sitra!" Just one word, but that\'s all he could do. She looked as she\r\nhad when he\'d left on this expedition, when they had said goodbye.\r\nSparkling with sequins in her dressing room, undulating with feathers\r\nin the right places, she walked toward him with the feline grace he\'d\r\nlearned to love.\r\n\r\n"Sitra!" he shouted again. Astonished, he deserted his position behind\r\nthe gun and started running across the plain. Gracefully, daintily,\r\nencountering difficulties because of her spiked heels on the rough\r\nterrain, she smiled bravely and hurried toward him.\r\n\r\nForsyth saw the approaching figure too. He tensed with disbelief and\r\nsurprise and then his voice rose excitedly.\r\n\r\n"Jimmy, _Jimmy!_" What was his boy doing _here_? Reason faded as he\r\nwatched his nine-year-old son stumbling toward the ship. He unfastened\r\nhis harness and slipped from behind the gun: _his_ boy on an alien\r\nplanet, confronting unknown dangers! He must--_must_--get him back to\r\nthe ship and the little ring of certainty behind the guns. Forsyth\r\nstarted across the level space, grateful that the towering hulk of\r\nMurph had recognized his boy and would, on this unknown world, help\r\nbring the kid back to comparative safety. In six hours, now, the\r\nfleet would be here. The boy could be sent home on one of the capital\r\nships....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBehind him Jamison watched the two figures running away. His face froze\r\ninto granite. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Rage and resentment surged within him. Across the plain\r\nhe saw the man who had stolen, yes, _stolen_, the championship from\r\nhim. The fighter loped toward him casually, sneering and confident.\r\nJamison felt a surge like an electric shock across his shoulders. His\r\nteeth ground together and he could hear their roaring within his ears.\r\nDeliberately he moved from behind his gun, started at a fighter\'s dog\r\ntrot toward his opponent. It occurred to him that Murph and Forsyth\r\nwould beat him there. He was glad they were willing to help, but for\r\nthe sake of his own integrity he considered this _his_ fight.\r\n\r\nJamison ran swiftly then. He passed Forsyth and Murph, determined to be\r\nthe first to reach the one man he hated. He sprinted eagerly, sucking\r\nthe strange air chemicals of this world into his lungs. He was short\r\nof breath. Behind him he heard the heavy thudding of Murph plunging\r\nand plowing toward him, and in addition, the light but rapid steps of\r\nForsyth. By now he didn\'t care. He was confronting his opponent.\r\n\r\nDropping into a crouch, Jamison moved in. Feet wide, tense; there\r\nwould be no mistake, no error, this time. His fist lashed out and\r\nhis opponent fell on the strange and powdery dust of a strange world\r\nmillions of miles from their first fight.\r\n\r\nThe man started struggling up--and again flat-footed, tense, fists like\r\ncrunching sledge hammers, Jamison dove at him.\r\n\r\nAnd then it happened. Murph hit Jamison from the side. Raw and choking\r\nwith rage, Murph clubbed, groped, kicked, fouled, until the ex-fighter\r\nfell in the pale and strange dust. Murph\'s voice was hoarse and shaking:\r\n\r\n"Hit my woman, will you!" he screamed in rage.\r\n\r\nJamison tried to rally, but each time he moved Murph\'s fists slammed\r\nagainst his face and head.\r\n\r\nThere was a final crash as the back of his head struck against the\r\nrocks on the ground. Jamison lay in the dust on an alien planet and\r\nfrom behind his right ear gray and reddish matter oozed. He didn\'t move.\r\n\r\nMurph stood up. He looked again at Sitra. He was choked and tired,\r\nstanding there, and as he grasped for breath, Forsyth ran by him, ran\r\nup to her. Angrily he watched. Forsyth running up to _his_ woman! What\r\nwas wrong with these men? Murph saw Forsyth put his arms around Sitra,\r\nand say--meaninglessly to Murph--"Jimmy, Jimmy!"\r\n\r\nAgain a red rage filled Murph. He dove forward, smashed into Forsyth,\r\nand the navigator reeled backwards. As he fell back, his feet tangled\r\nin the scrubby vegetation of the planet, he reached toward his belt and\r\nhis electro-gun jerked free from the holster. He saw the bull shape of\r\nMurph over him, an enraged beast, and as he fell, the twin electrodes\r\nshot out an energy stream. Fear and hatred tensed his nerves, but\r\ndespite the emotion, he set the range right. The sparks arced together\r\njust in front of the great bulk of Murph. There was a crackling and\r\nthe smell of burning flesh, then a surprised look upon Murph\'s face.\r\nThe surprise turned to rage and the last thing Forsyth saw was Murph\r\nfalling down on him, his clothes and his chest burned away until the\r\nribs showed, animal rage welling from his lips.\r\n\r\nA figure stood fifty feet away and watched this drama. Murph, blood\r\ncoughing from his mouth and nose, the great muscles of his chest\r\nnothing but crisp burned meat, reached for Forsyth, picked him up,\r\nholding him over his head as an ape would a man, and slammed him again\r\nand again to the ground.\r\n\r\nThe final time Murph tried to lift Forsyth, his strength gave out. He\r\ndropped Forsyth\'s limp form, coughed in a final paroxysm, and fell\r\nbeside Forsyth and Jamison.\r\n\r\nThe figure which stood fifty feet away turned and walked leisurely\r\nback over the rise.\r\n\r\nNow, it was not a fighter, and it was not Jimmy, and it was not Sitra.\r\nIt was a denizen of the planet and it looked like no human.\r\n\r\nShortly thereafter the all-wave radio in the deadly, powerful silvery\r\nneedle standing serenely on the strange world blared again.\r\n\r\n"... in accordance with Interstellar Code we have asked that we not be\r\ninvaded and are warning you that according to Article 19, Section 3,\r\nfleets which invade a peaceful people become subject to unprincipled\r\nattack, even to the use of psychological weapons."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFive hours away the main fleet streaked toward the planet. The Admiral\r\nlooked at the tape reports from the scout ship and at transcripts of\r\nthe recorded warning.\r\n\r\n"Nuts!" he said. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
"We go in."\r\n\r\nHe felt an odd, intuitive twinge. The voice was so much like his\r\nmother\'s--and she hadn\'t been well when he\'d last seen her. Beside\r\nhim the Radioman busily, tersely, sent out landing instructions. He\r\nfelt irritable: the voice had sounded just like Peggy--that no-good,\r\ncheating!... He shrugged: just imagination.\r\n\r\nIn a diminishing spiral, the fleet swung around the planet while the\r\nAdmiral scanned the screen for a free landing site.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
