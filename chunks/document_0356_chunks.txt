The question is ... how late?\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n                 Galaxy Science Fiction October 1950.\r\n            Extensive research did not uncover any evidence\r\n        that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nObviously the Archeologist\'s study belonged to an era vastly distant\r\nfrom today. Familiar similarities here and there only sharpened the\r\nfeeling of alienage. The sunlight that filtered through the windows in\r\nthe ceiling had a wan and greenish cast and was augmented by radiation\r\nfrom some luminous material impregnating the walls and floor. Even the\r\nwide desk and the commodious hassocks glowed with a restful light.\r\nAcross the former were scattered metal-backed wax tablets, styluses,\r\nand a pair of large and oddly formed spectacles. The crammed bookcases\r\nwere not particularly unusual, but the books were bound in metal and\r\nthe script on their spines would have been utterly unfamiliar to the\r\nmost erudite of modern linguists. One of the books, lying open on a\r\nhassock, showed leaves of a thin, flexible, rustless metal covered\r\nwith luminous characters. Between the bookcases were phosphorescent oil\r\npaintings, mainly of sea bottoms, in somber greens and browns. Their\r\nstyle, neither wholly realistic nor abstract, would have baffled the\r\nhistorian of art.\r\n\r\nA blackboard with large colored crayons hinted equally at the\r\nschoolroom and the studio.\r\n\r\nIn the center of the room, midway to the ceiling, hung a fish with\r\nirridescent scales of breathtaking beauty. So invisible was its means\r\nof support that--also taking into account the strange paintings and the\r\ngreenish light--one would have sworn that the object was to create an\r\nunderwater scene.\r\n\r\nThe Explorer made his entrance in a theatrical swirl of movement. He\r\nembraced the Archeologist with a warmth calculated to startle that\r\ncrusty old fellow. Then he settled himself on a hassock, looked up\r\nand asked a question in a speech and idiom so different from any we\r\nknow that it must be called another means of communication rather than\r\nanother language. The import was, "Well, what about it?"\r\n\r\nIf the Archeologist were taken aback, he concealed it. His expression\r\nshowed only pleasure at being reunited with a long-absent friend.\r\n\r\n"What about what?" he queried.\r\n\r\n"About your discovery!"\r\n\r\n"What discovery?" The Archeologist\'s incomprehension was playful.\r\n\r\nThe Explorer threw up his arms. "Why, what else but your discovery,\r\nhere on Earth, of the remains of an intelligent species? It\'s the find\r\nof the age! Am I going to have to coax you? 

=== Chunk 2 ===
Out with it!"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t make the discovery," the other said tranquilly. "I only\r\nsupervised the excavations and directed the correlation of material.\r\n_You_ ought to be doing the talking. _You\'re_ the one who\'s just\r\nreturned from the stars."\r\n\r\n"Forget that." The Explorer brushed the question aside. "As soon as\r\nour spaceship got within radio range of Earth, they started to send\r\nus a continuous newscast covering the period of our absence. One of\r\nthe items, exasperatingly brief, mentioned your discovery. It captured\r\nmy imagination. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
I couldn\'t wait to hear the details." He paused, then\r\nconfessed, "You get so eager out there in space--a metal-filmed droplet\r\nof life lost in immensity. You rediscover your emotions...." He\r\nchanged color, then finished rapidly, "As soon as I could decently get\r\naway, I came straight to you. I wanted to hear about it from the best\r\nauthority--yourself."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Archeologist regarded him quizzically. "I\'m pleased that you should\r\nthink of me and my work, and I\'m very happy to see you again. But admit\r\nit now, isn\'t there something a bit odd about your getting so worked\r\nup over this thing? I can understand that after your long absence from\r\nEarth, any news of Earth would seem especially important. But isn\'t\r\nthere an additional reason?"\r\n\r\nThe Explorer twisted impatiently. "Oh, I suppose there is.\r\nDisappointment, for one thing. We were hoping to get in touch with\r\nintelligent life out there. We were specially trained in techniques for\r\nestablishing mental contact with alien intelligent life forms. Well, we\r\nfound some planets with life upon them, all right. But it was primitive\r\nlife, not worth bothering about."\r\n\r\nAgain he hesitated embarrassedly. "Out there you get to thinking of\r\nthe preciousness of intelligence. There\'s so little of it, and it\'s so\r\nlonely. And we so greatly need intercourse with another intelligent\r\nspecies to give depth and balance to our thoughts. I suppose I set\r\ntoo much store by my hopes of establishing a contact." 

=== Chunk 4 ===
He paused. "At\r\nany rate, when I heard that what we were looking for, you had found\r\nhere at home--even though dead and done for--I felt that at least it\r\nwas something. I was suddenly very eager. It is odd, I know, to get\r\nso worked up about an extinct species--as if my interest could mean\r\nanything to them now--but that\'s the way it hit me."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSeveral small shadows crossed the windows overhead. They might have\r\nbeen birds, except they moved too slowly.\r\n\r\n"I think I understand," the Archeologist said softly.\r\n\r\n"So get on with it and tell me about your discovery!" the Explorer\r\nexploded.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve already told you that it wasn\'t my discovery," the Archeologist\r\nreminded him. "A few years after your expedition left, there was begun\r\na detailed resurvey of Earth\'s mineral resources. In the course of\r\nsome deep continental borings, one party discovered a cache--either a\r\nvery large box or a rather small room--with metallic walls of great\r\nstrength and toughness. Evidently its makers had intended it for the\r\nvery purpose of carrying a message down through the ages. It proved to\r\ncontain artifacts; models of buildings, vehicles, and machines, objects\r\nof art, pictures, and books--hundreds of books, along with elaborate\r\npictorial dictionaries for interpreting them. So now we even understand\r\ntheir languages."\r\n\r\n"Languages?" interrupted the Explorer. "That\'s queer. Somehow one\r\nthinks of an alien species as having just one language."\r\n\r\n"Like our own, this species had several, though there were some words\r\nand symbols that were alike in all their languages. These words and\r\nsymbols seem to have come down unchanged from their most distant\r\nprehistory."\r\n\r\nThe Explorer burst out, "I am not interested in all that dry stuff!\r\nGive me the wet! What were they like? How did they live? What did they\r\ncreate? 

=== Chunk 5 ===
What did they want?"\r\n\r\nThe Archeologist gently waved aside the questions. "All in good time.\r\nIf I am to tell you everything you want to know, I must tell it my own\r\nway. Now that you are back on Earth, you will have to reacquire those\r\norderly and composed habits of thought which you have partly lost in\r\nthe course of your wild interstellar adventurings."\r\n\r\n"Curse you, I think you\'re just trying to tantalize me."\r\n\r\nThe Archeologist\'s expression showed that this was not altogether\r\nuntrue. He casually fondled an animal that had wriggled up onto his\r\ndesk, and which looked rather more like an eel than a snake. "Cute\r\nlittle brute, isn\'t it?" 

=== Chunk 6 ===
he remarked. When it became apparent that the\r\nExplorer wasn\'t to be provoked into another outburst, he continued, "It\r\nbecame my task to interpret the contents of the cache, to reconstruct\r\nits makers\' climb from animalism and savagery to civilization, their\r\nrather rapid spread across the world\'s surface, their first fumbling\r\nattempts to escape from the Earth."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"They had spaceships?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s barely possible. I rather hope they did, since it would mean\r\nthe chance of a survival elsewhere, though the negative results of\r\nyour expedition rather lessen that." He went on, "The cache was laid\r\ndown when they were first attempting space flight, just after their\r\ndiscovery of atomic power, in the first flush of their youth. It was\r\nprobably created in a kind of exuberant fancifulness, with no serious\r\nbelief that it would ever serve the purpose for which it was intended."\r\nHe looked at the Explorer strangely. "If I am not mistaken, we have\r\nlaid down similar caches."\r\n\r\nAfter a moment the Archeologist continued, "My reconstruction of their\r\nhistory, subsequent to the laying down of the cache, has been largely\r\nhypothetical. I can only guess at the reasons for their decline and\r\nfall. Supplementary material has been very slow in coming in, though\r\nwe are still making extensive excavations at widely separated points.\r\nHere are the last reports." He tossed the Explorer a small metal-leaf\r\npamphlet. It flew with a curiously slow motion.\r\n\r\n"That\'s what struck me so queer right from the start," the Explorer\r\nobserved, putting the pamphlet aside after a glance. "If these\r\ncreatures were relatively advanced, why haven\'t we learned about them\r\nbefore? They must have left so many things--buildings, machines,\r\nengineering projects, some of them on a large scale. You\'d think we\'d\r\nbe turning up traces everywhere."\r\n\r\n"I have four answers to that," the Archeologist replied. "The first\r\nis the most obvious. Time. Geologic ages of it. The second is more\r\nsubtle. What if we should have been looking in the wrong place? I mean,\r\nwhat if the creatures occupied a very different portion of the Earth\r\nthan our own? Third, it\'s possible that atomic energy, out of control,\r\nfinished the race and destroyed its traces. The present distribution of\r\nradioactive compounds throughout the Earth\'s surface lends some support\r\nto this theory.\r\n\r\n"Fourth," he went on, "it\'s my belief that when an intelligent species\r\nbegins to retrogress, it tends to destroy, or, rather, debase all the\r\nthings it has laboriously created. Large buildings are torn down to\r\nmake smaller ones. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Machines are broken up and worked into primitive\r\ntools and weapons. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
There is a kind of unraveling or erasing. A cultural\r\nSecond Law of Thermodynamics begins to operate, whereby the intellect\r\nand all its works are gradually degraded to the lowest level of meaning\r\nand creativity."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"But why?" The Explorer sounded anguished. "Why should any intelligent\r\nspecies end like that? I grant the possibility of atomic power\r\ngetting out of hand, though one would have thought they\'d have taken\r\nthe greatest precautions. Still, it could happen. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
But that fourth\r\nanswer--it\'s morbid."\r\n\r\n"Cultures and civilizations die," said the Archeologist evenly. "That\r\nhas happened repeatedly in our own history. Why not species? An\r\nindividual dies--and is there anything intrinsically more terrible in\r\nthe death of a species than in the death of an individual?"\r\n\r\nHe paused. "With respect to the members of this one species, I think\r\nthat a certain temperamental instability hastened their end. Their\r\nappetites and emotions were not sufficiently subordinated to their\r\nunderstanding and to their sense of drama--their enjoyment of the\r\ncomedy and tragedy of existence. They were impatient and easily\r\nincapacitated by frustration. They seem to have been singularly guilty\r\nin their pleasures, behaving either like gloomy moralists or gluttons.\r\n\r\n"Because of taboos and an overgrown possessiveness," he continued,\r\n"each individual tended to limit his affection to a tiny family; in\r\nmany cases he focused his love on himself alone. They set great store\r\nby personal prestige, by the amassing of wealth and the exercise of\r\npower. Their notable capacity for thought and manipulative activity was\r\nexpended on things rather than persons or feelings. Their technology\r\noutstripped their psychology. They skimped fatally when it came to hard\r\nthinking about the purpose of life and intellectual activity, and the\r\nmeans for preserving them."\r\n\r\nAgain the slow shadows drifted overhead.\r\n\r\n"And finally," the Archeologist said, "they were a strangely haunted\r\nspecies. They seem to have been obsessed by the notion that others,\r\ngreater than themselves, had prospered before them and then died,\r\nleaving them to rebuild a civilization from ruins. It was from those\r\nothers that they thought they derived the few words and symbols common\r\nto all their languages."\r\n\r\n"Gods?" mused the Explorer.\r\n\r\nThe Archeologist shrugged. "Who knows?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Explorer turned away. His excitement had visibly evaporated,\r\nleaving behind a cold and miserable residue of feeling. "I am not\r\nsure I want to hear much more about them," he said. "They sound\r\ntoo much like us. Perhaps it was a mistake, my coming here. Pardon\r\nme, old friend, but out there in space even _our_ emotions become\r\nundisciplined. Everything becomes indescribably poignant. Moods\r\nare tempestuous. You shift in an instant from zenith to nadir--and\r\nremember, out there you can see both.\r\n\r\n"I was very eager to hear about this lost species," he added in a sad\r\nvoice. "I thought I would feel a kind of fellowship with them across\r\nthe eons. Instead, I touch only corpses. It reminds me of when, out in\r\nspace, there looms up before your prow, faint in the starlight, a dead\r\nsun. They were a young race. They thought they were getting somewhere.\r\nThey promised themselves an eternity of effort. And all the while there\r\nwas wriggling toward them out of that future for which they yearned ...\r\noh, it\'s so completely futile and unfair."\r\n\r\n"I disagree," the Archeologist said spiritedly. "Really, your absence\r\nfrom Earth has unsettled you even more than I first surmised. Look at\r\nthe matter squarely. Death comes to everything in the end. Our past\r\nis strewn with our dead. That species died, it\'s true. But what they\r\nachieved, they achieved. What happiness they had, they had. What they\r\ndid in their short span is as significant as what they might have done\r\nhad they lived a billion years. The present is always more important\r\nthan the future. And no creature can have all the future--it must be\r\nshared, left to others."\r\n\r\n"Maybe so," the Explorer said slowly. "Yes, I guess you\'re right. But\r\nI still feel a horrible wistfulness about them, and I hug to myself\r\nthe hope that a few of them escaped and set up a colony on some planet\r\nwe haven\'t yet visited." There was a long silence. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
Then the Explorer\r\nturned back. "You old devil," he said in a manner that showed his gayer\r\nand more boisterous mood had returned, though diminished, "you still\r\nhaven\'t told me anything definite about them."\r\n\r\n"So I haven\'t," replied the Archeologist with guileful innocence.\r\n"Well, they were vertebrates."\r\n\r\n"Oh?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. What\'s more, they were mammals."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Mammals? I was expecting something different."\r\n\r\n"I thought you were."\r\n\r\nThe Explorer shifted. "All this matter of evolutionary categories is\r\npretty cut-and-dried. Even a knowledge of how they looked doesn\'t\r\nmean much. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
I\'d like to approach them in a more intimate way. How did\r\nthey think of themselves? What did they call themselves? I know the\r\nword won\'t mean anything to me, but it will give me a feeling--of\r\nrecognition."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t say the word," the Archeologist told him, "because I haven\'t\r\nthe proper vocal equipment. But I know enough of their script to be\r\nable to write it for you as they would have written it. Incidentally,\r\nit is one of those words common to all their languages, that they\r\nattributed to an earlier race of beings."\r\n\r\nThe Archeologist extended one of his eight tentacles toward the\r\nblackboard. The suckers at its tip firmly grasped a bit of orange\r\ncrayon. Another of his tentacles took up the spectacles and adjusted\r\nthem over his three-inch protruding pupils.\r\n\r\nThe eel-like glittering pet drifted back into the room and nosed\r\ncuriously about the crayon as it traced:\r\n\r\n                                  RAT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
