PURDOM\r\n\r\n                 _Chances are you\'ll sympathize deeply\r\n                 with Henry Westing, who merely wanted\r\n                to go on living his own life in his own\r\n               manner. But under the same circumstances,\r\n                   how would you go about doing it?_\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n                        Infinity October 1958.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAll his life people had been trying to get Henry Westing to sign up.\r\nThey were all signing up themselves and they wanted everybody else to\r\nsign up too.\r\n\r\nIn college it had been the fraternities. Mr. Westing hadn\'t tried to\r\njoin one.\r\n\r\n"But you\'ve got to belong to something," they said. "Everybody does.

=== Chunk 2 ===
"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t."\r\n\r\n"Sure you do. You\'re just being rebellious."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps."\r\n\r\n"Everybody\'s got to belong. Ask any psychologist."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps. I wouldn\'t know.

=== Chunk 3 ===
"\r\n\r\nAfter college it had been work. He had lost three jobs in a row for\r\nthe same reason.\r\n\r\n"We\'re sorry, Westing, but you just don\'t seem to fit in with the\r\ngroup."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t I do my work well?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but you don\'t seem to _belong_. We like men who consider\r\nthemselves part of The Company, not just people who work here."\r\n\r\nIn the end he had found a job in a large travel agency in the center of\r\nPhiladelphia. This is a business in which everyone at least pretends to\r\nbe cynical about his work, so Westing was able to keep his position no\r\nmatter how he acted. Of course by this time he had learned to keep his\r\nmouth shut.\r\n\r\nAll around him he watched people signing up. "You\'ve got to have\r\nsomething bigger than yourself," they said. "You\'ve got to belong."\r\n\r\nHe watched them do it and went on living his own life. He loved\r\nconcerts and books and plays. He loved his friends, who were good\r\ncompany and whom he saw often. He loved a couple of girls, too, and\r\nhoped that someday he would love one well enough to marry her.\r\n\r\nHe lived a very happy life and belonged to nothing.\r\n\r\nThen one night in January someone knocked on his door. It was a\r\nSaturday and he was just getting dressed to go to the Academy of Music.\r\nHe opened the door of his apartment and looked into the hall.\r\n\r\nThere was a young man standing there. He had black rimmed glasses and a\r\ncrew cut. He wore a slim, well-tailored suit.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Westing?"\r\n\r\n"Yes?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m from the Organization. We\'d like you to join."\r\n\r\n"What organization?"\r\n\r\n"_The_ Organization. The Organization for people who don\'t belong to\r\nany organization."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid I\'m not interested."\r\n\r\n"But you must be. It says here that you don\'t belong to anything. We\'re\r\nhere to give you a chance to belong."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the purpose of the organization?"\r\n\r\n"It gives its members a feeling of belonging to something. Everybody\'s\r\njoining. You don\'t want to be left out, do you?"\r\n\r\n"Not if I can help it. But I\'m afraid you\'ll have to try somebody else."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t. We never give up."\r\n\r\n"I see. Good night, young man."\r\n\r\nHe tried to close the door. Before he was quite certain what was\r\nhappening, the young man had slipped into the apartment.\r\n\r\n"I\'m going to a concert," Mr. Westing said. "They\'re playing Brahms\'\r\nFirst. I\'ve never heard it and I\'ve been looking forward to hearing it\r\never since I heard his Second. I\'d appreciate it if you left."\r\n\r\n"But don\'t you _want_ to belong, Mr. Westing?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Not to anything?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\nThe young man shook his head. "But most people are glad to join. We\r\noffer them what they\'ve been looking for all their lives."\r\n\r\n"Then go see them." He put on his jacket and adjusted his tie. "Care\r\nfor a drink?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t drink."\r\n\r\n"Why not?

=== Chunk 4 ===
"\r\n\r\n"It interferes with my work. We\'re out to double the size of the\r\nOrganization. I work very hard at it."\r\n\r\n"Do you? 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Why?"\r\n\r\n"It gives me a sense of belonging."\r\n\r\nMr. Westing started for the door. "I\'m about to leave," he said. "I\r\nthink it would be best if you left too."\r\n\r\nThe young man sighed. "I can see where you\'re going to be a difficult\r\ncase."\r\n\r\n"Probably. Will you turn off the light, please?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe met his date and immediately put the incident out of his mind. They\r\nlistened to Brahms\' First and it was everything Westing had hoped it\r\nwould be. Afterwards, when they were sitting in a bar, he told her\r\nabout the Organization.\r\n\r\nThe girl seemed surprised. It was the second time he had taken her out\r\nand she didn\'t know him very well.\r\n\r\n"You ought to belong to something," she said. "Why don\'t you join?"\r\n\r\n"You mean that?"\r\n\r\n"Everybody should belong to something. You can\'t be useless."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not useless. I make my contribution. More than most people, in\r\nfact."\r\n\r\n"But you can\'t just live for yourself."\r\n\r\n"Why not?

=== Chunk 6 ===
"\r\n\r\nShe struggled. "Because you can\'t," she said.\r\n\r\nHe took her home when the bar closed at midnight. The conversation was\r\none he had engaged in with other girls but it still depressed him. He\r\nhopped the subway and went across the river to Camden, New Jersey,\r\nwhere they are more reasonable about the hours at which bars remain\r\nopen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next morning he had a hangover. He was just pouring some tomato\r\njuice when someone knocked at his door.\r\n\r\n"Just a minute," he said.\r\n\r\nHe opened the door. A man in a tweed suit stood in the hall. He had a\r\nrelaxed, pleasant face and he smoked a pipe.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Westing?"\r\n\r\n"Yes?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m Dr. Cooper. May I come in?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t ask for a doctor. I could use one but I haven\'t called one\r\nyet."\r\n\r\n"Oh? What\'s your trouble?"\r\n\r\n"Hangover. I had a rugged night."\r\n\r\n"Why? What made you do a thing like that?"\r\n\r\nHe shrugged. "It\'s hard to say."\r\n\r\n"Insecurity," Dr. Cooper said. "Many people try to evade their\r\ninsecurities by drinking. Why don\'t you tell me about it?

=== Chunk 7 ===
"\r\n\r\nHe hesitated. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
"Well," he said. "It\'s early."\r\n\r\nDr. Cooper started forward and he automatically stepped back to let him\r\nin.\r\n\r\n"Who sent you anyway?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t they tell you I was coming?"\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t who tell me you were coming?"\r\n\r\n"The Organization. I\'m their head psychologist."\r\n\r\n"I should have known."\r\n\r\n"You sound annoyed."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid I don\'t want to join the Organization. Ever."\r\n\r\nDr. Cooper lit his pipe. "I think you should," he said. "It would\r\nrelieve you of your insecurities. You obviously need to belong to\r\nsomething."\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"It is a natural need in all human organisms. A man by himself is\r\nincomplete and unsatisfied. He has no outlet for his energies and his\r\ntalents."\r\n\r\n"I have very little energy and no talent."\r\n\r\n"You\'re being modest. I understand you have a great deal of both."\r\nCooper looked around the apartment. "Don\'t you _want_ to belong, Mr.\r\nWesting?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you belong to anything?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"You\'re sure? You were a political canvasser in the last election,\r\nweren\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but that was different."\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t it give you a sense of belonging?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but I didn\'t like it. I felt trapped."\r\n\r\n"Then why did you do it?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m a citizen. I like to keep my accounts even."\r\n\r\n"Then you didn\'t really belong?" the doctor said.\r\n\r\n"Not the way you mean."\r\n\r\n"This is very interesting. You honestly think you can live without\r\nbelonging to anything?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you belong to the human race?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and I try to keep my dues up, too. But it\'s more of a strain than\r\na pleasure."\r\n\r\nDr. Cooper puffed on his pipe. "I can see you\'re going to be a real\r\nchallenge," he said.\r\n\r\n"Thank you. I intend to be."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got some literature outside. I think you should read it."\r\n\r\n"You can leave it if you like."\r\n\r\n"I will." 

=== Chunk 9 ===
A few more puffs. The psychologist looked extremely serene.\r\n"You know, you\'re a very sick man."\r\n\r\n"So I\'ve been told."\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you let me cure you?"\r\n\r\n"First you have to convince me I\'m sick."\r\n\r\n"That\'s true."\r\n\r\nThey talked aimlessly for another half-hour. Cooper left, and Westing\r\nlooked over the literature.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe started to throw it away. Then his conscience twinged. If he was\r\ngoing to fight this thing, he was going to fight it honestly. He would\r\nmeet their techniques of persuasion, not evade them.\r\n\r\nHe sat down and read all the pamphlets. _The Need to Belong._ _The\r\nSense of Unity._ Testimonials from members of the Organization who had\r\nfound salvation in its ranks. It was all very well done and rather\r\nweakening to a man with a hangover.\r\n\r\nHe sat for a long time in his apartment, brooding over it. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
Then he got\r\nup and threw all the literature in the trash.\r\n\r\n"They\'ll have to do better than that," he said.\r\n\r\nThe next evening, when he got back from work, he found a package in his\r\nmail. It was a long-play, high-fidelity Calypso record. The notice said\r\nit was a Get-Acquainted Gift from the Jamaican Record Society.\r\n\r\nAfter supper he put the record on. When it had been playing for a while\r\nhe got up and, as he often did, began to improvise dance steps to the\r\nmusic. It was great fun and the record was half over before he noticed\r\nthe words had been subtly changing.\r\n\r\n    "_House built on a rock foundation will not stand, oh no, oh no,_"\r\n    _You must join the Organization, now now, now now...._"\r\n\r\nHe snapped off the hi-fi. But the chanting went on in his mind. _You\r\nmust join the Organization, you must join the Organization...._\r\n\r\nHe put on his coat and went out for a walk. When he got back he didn\'t\r\nfeel like reading so he turned on the television set. There was a very\r\nserious play on. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
He settled back to watch it. It was about a young man\r\nwho lived all alone in the city and of his groping toward a better life.\r\n\r\n"If I could only belong someplace," the young man said to the girl\r\nduring the second act. "I\'ve never belonged anywhere."\r\n\r\n"Everybody should belong," the girl said.\r\n\r\nThe young man nodded and groped with his hands. "Or else they\'ll be\r\nlike Henry Westing," he mumbled.\r\n\r\nMr. Westing got up and turned off the set. He rotated it and looked at\r\nthe back. There was a little box screwed in one corner.\r\n\r\n"Very clever," he said. He tore the box off and went to bed.\r\n\r\nHe was just falling asleep when the phone rang. He reached for it in\r\nthe dark.\r\n\r\n"Westing speaking."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Westing? This is Miss Beyle from the Organization. We\'re calling\r\nup to see if there are any questions you may have."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid I don\'t. I\'m trying to sleep."\r\n\r\n"So early?"\r\n\r\n"I felt like it."\r\n\r\n"You must be terribly lonely. Why don\'t you come down to Headquarters\r\nfor cakes and coffee? We\'re having a good time."\r\n\r\n"Miss Beyle, I\'ve done some canvassing myself. You\'re doing a good job\r\nbut you\'ve got the wrong man."\r\n\r\nShe laughed. It was a very pleasant laugh.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Mr. Westing. You sound like the kind of man we need. We\'ve\r\ngot a big job to do and there\'s a place here for you anytime you want\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Doing what?"\r\n\r\n"Recruiting new members."\r\n\r\n"Good evening, Miss Beyle. I\'ve always tried to be a gentleman. I\'d\r\nbetter hang up before I forget myself."\r\n\r\nHe hung up and tried to sleep.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next day an economist came to see him. The day after it was\r\na social scientist and the day after that a political scientist.\r\nHe listened patiently for a week as they sat in his apartment and\r\nexplained the importance of the group to him.\r\n\r\n"Man is nothing," they said. "Unless he belongs to a group."\r\n\r\n"On the contrary," Mr. Westing said, "the group is nothing unless I\r\nbelong to it."\r\n\r\n"That\'s egotism."\r\n\r\n"Probably."\r\n\r\nBut he knew he was weakening. He held out with the stubborn feeling he\r\nwas resisting the tides of history. 

=== Chunk 12 ===
He felt very brave and strong.\r\n\r\nThere was a one-day lull. He woke up the morning after and heard a\r\nsound truck blasting away in the street one floor below.\r\n\r\nHENRY WESTING DOES NOT BELONG HENRY WESTING BELONGS TO NOTHING REFORM\r\nHENRY WESTING REFORM HENRY WESTING....\r\n\r\n"Outrageous," he said.\r\n\r\nHe dressed, had breakfast and started for work. People stood on their\r\ndoorsteps and stared at him when he stepped onto the sidewalk. He\r\nsmiled pleasantly at the driver of the truck.\r\n\r\n"Good morning," he said. "Nice day, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\nThe driver nodded sullenly.\r\n\r\n_Very good_, Mr. Westing thought. _You\'re doing splendidly._\r\n\r\nAt work he was tired and drawn out. He had trouble concentrating. The\r\nDepartment Manager commented on it.\r\n\r\n"You\'re not acting like a Company man, Henry."\r\n\r\n"I\'m a little tired. 

=== Chunk 13 ===
I had a hard night."\r\n\r\n"What was she like?"\r\n\r\n"Dismal."\r\n\r\nEverything was dismal. The jingles ran through his head endlessly. So\r\ndid the slogans and the words from the sound truck. He was beginning to\r\ndoubt himself.\r\n\r\nPerhaps they were right. Perhaps he _did_ need to belong.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat night the sound truck was still there. It circled the block,\r\nadvertising the Organization and denouncing Henry Westing.\r\n\r\nThere were signs on all the houses too. _We Belong to the\r\nOrganization_, the signs said. There was a sign on every door except\r\nhis.\r\n\r\nHe went upstairs and made dinner. Then he sat by the window and tried\r\nto think. Down below he could hear the sound truck.\r\n\r\nThey\'re getting to you, he thought. A little more and they\'ll have you\r\nwhipped. You\'d better do something.\r\n\r\nHe picked up the phone and dialed.\r\n\r\n"Yes?" a voice answered.\r\n\r\n"This is Henry Westing."\r\n\r\n"Ahh, Mr. Westing. I thought you\'d be calling soon."\r\n\r\n"You may send your representative over to my apartment this evening.\r\nTell him to bring everything."\r\n\r\n"Application forms?"\r\n\r\n"Everything. Whatever you use to close the deal."\r\n\r\n"He\'ll be there at eight."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be waiting."\r\n\r\nAt eight o\'clock the young man rang his bell. He was burdened down with\r\nequipment.\r\n\r\n"Come in," Mr. Westing said.\r\n\r\n"Thank you."\r\n\r\n"What\'s all that you\'re carrying?"\r\n\r\n"Educational material. Mind if I set it up?

=== Chunk 14 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Go right ahead."\r\n\r\nHe poured himself a brandy and soda and watched. The young man seemed\r\nnervous and strained as he set up a hemispherical device which seemed\r\nto be a projector.\r\n\r\nMr. Westing glanced at a leatherette folder the young man had put aside\r\nwhile he worked. The folder bore a neatly labelled title: _Prospects_.\r\n\r\nHis heart skipped a beat.\r\n\r\nHe made sure the young man was absorbed in his work. Then he carefully\r\nleafed through the book.\r\n\r\n"This Marline Harris looks like an interesting case. What\'s she like?

=== Chunk 15 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Did I leave that there? I\'m sorry, I can\'t let you look at it."\r\n\r\n"Sorry. 

=== Chunk 16 ===
I didn\'t know."\r\n\r\nThe young man took the folder and went back to work.\r\n\r\n"Do you have a girl?" Mr. Westing asked.\r\n\r\n"Too busy."\r\n\r\n"Oh." He sipped his drink. "That Harris girl certainly has been holding\r\nout, hasn\'t she?"\r\n\r\n"She\'s a tough one. I\'ve been to see her six times. It\'s funny, too,\r\nbecause she\'s so lonely."\r\n\r\n"Really?"\r\n\r\n"She\'s too independent. Men don\'t like her. And she\'s pretty\r\nnice-looking, too. It\'s a shame she can\'t act like a woman."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I guess it is."\r\n\r\n"There," the young man said. "Now if you\'ll just sit down there."\r\n\r\n"Care for a drink?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t drink."\r\n\r\n"Not even to be sociable?"\r\n\r\n"Sociable? Perhaps I should at that."\r\n\r\nMr. Westing poured another brandy and soda. There was a great deal more\r\nbrandy than soda.\r\n\r\n"You work hard, don\'t you?" he said.\r\n\r\n"We\'re in the middle of a big drive now. This is a very important job."\r\nThe young man took a drink, the kind a man who has always drunk water\r\ntakes.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I guess it is rather important. Organizing, getting things done.\r\nA very active life."\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I like, activity. I like to _live_, not just sit around."\r\n\r\n"Very understandable."\r\n\r\nThe young man took another drink. His face underwent a subtle change.\r\n\r\n"Let me turn the machine on. We\'d better get started."\r\n\r\n"Did you have dinner yet?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been too busy."\r\n\r\n"Good, good."\r\n\r\n"Good?"\r\n\r\n"Good that you work so hard. Shows character."\r\n\r\n"Thank you. 

=== Chunk 17 ===
Now if you\'ll just sit back there, we\'ll turn the machine\r\non." The young man seemed to be having trouble focussing his eyes.\r\n\r\nWesting lit a good cigar and offered his guest one. "To be sociable,"\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\n"In that case, all right."\r\n\r\n"You should have another brandy to go with it." He handed him one as he\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\nThe young man took it, gulped it down automatically and turned on the\r\nmachine. Westing pulled on his cigar and settled back in his chair. He\r\nmade sure there was another drink by the boy\'s arm.\r\n\r\n"Do you know anything about drinking?"\r\n\r\n"Why no, I don\'t."\r\n\r\n"Three\'s the custom. Three drinks and you\'re friends. You belong.

=== Chunk 18 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Then I guess I better."\r\n\r\nThe room turned dark. Stars covered the walls. The young man took\r\nanother swallow.\r\n\r\n"To what do you belong?" a deep voice said. "Of what are you a part?\r\nIn all this vast Universe, you alone are nothing. You alone have no\r\nmeaning. But you as part of something bigger...."\r\n\r\nA sunrise crept along the walls. The coloring was very good and Mr.\r\nWesting enjoyed it immensely.\r\n\r\nNext to him he heard a low sound. The young man was singing.\r\n\r\n"It\'s nice to watch the room spin, isn\'t it?" Mr. Westing asked.\r\n\r\n"I was just thinking that. It\'s beautiful.

=== Chunk 19 ===
"\r\n\r\n"I know. 

=== Chunk 20 ===
Excuse me a minute."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe got up and took the phone into the next room. As soon as he was out\r\nof earshot, he dialed the number he had memorized earlier.\r\n\r\nThe phone buzzed a few times. "Hello?" a woman answered.\r\n\r\n"Is this Miss Marline Harris?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, who is this?"\r\n\r\n"My name is Henry Westing. There\'s a man here trying to get me to join\r\nthe Organization and I saw your name and your picture in his Prospects\r\nbook."\r\n\r\n"Oh, are they after you, too?"\r\n\r\n"They\'ve been after me for a long time. Your picture looks very\r\nattractive, Miss Harris."\r\n\r\n"Thank you."\r\n\r\n"Do you like music?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do."\r\n\r\nA few minutes later he tip-toed into the living room. The film was\r\nstill playing, the persuasive voice still speaking. Now it was martial\r\nmusic and there were flags all over, waving, inspiring.\r\n\r\nIt takes two, Westing thought. Alone they were getting me. But the two\r\nof us together will be stronger.\r\n\r\nHe bent over the couch. The boy was asleep and dreaming. His face\r\nlooked peaceful.\r\n\r\nMr. Westing turned on a record. It was an unexpurgated reading of _The\r\nArabian Nights_. He placed the speaker close to the boy\'s ear.\r\n\r\nThen he got dressed and went out to meet Marline. He had beaten them\r\nonce again. Maybe they\'d get him someday, but way down deep he didn\'t\r\nbelieve it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
