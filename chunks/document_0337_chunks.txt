It was a fast way to commit suicide!...\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Imagination Stories of Science and Fantasy\r\n                               June 1958\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDane Harrell held the thought-helmet tightly between his hands and,\r\nbefore putting it on, glanced over at the bound, writhing alien sitting\r\nopposite him. The alien snarled defiantly.\r\n\r\n"You\'re sure you want to go through with this?" asked Dr. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
Phelps.\r\n\r\nHarrell nodded. "I volunteered, didn\'t I? I said I\'d take a look inside\r\nthis buzzard\'s brain and I\'m going to do it. If I don\'t come up in half\r\nan hour, come get me."\r\n\r\n"Right."\r\n\r\nHarrell slipped the cool bulk of the thought-helmet over his head and\r\nsignalled to the scientist, who pulled the actuator switch. Harrell\r\nshuddered as psionic current surged through him; he stiffened,\r\nwriggled, and felt himself glide out of his body, hover incorporeally\r\nin the air between his now soulless shell and the alien bound opposite.\r\n\r\n_Remember, you volunteered_, he told himself.\r\n\r\nHe hung for a moment outside the alien\'s skull; then, he drifted\r\ndownward and in. He had entered the alien\'s mind. Whether he would\r\nemerge alive, and with the troop-deployment data--well, that was\r\nanother matter entirely.\r\n\r\nThe patrol-ships of the Terran outpost on Planetoid 113 had discovered\r\nthe alien scout a week before. The Dimellian spy was lurking about the\r\noutermost reaches of the Terran safety zone when he was caught.\r\n\r\nIt wasn\'t often that Earth captured a Dimellian alive and so the\r\nOutpost resolved to comb as much information from him as possible.\r\nThe Earth-Dimell war was four years old; neither side had scored a\r\ndecisive victory. It was believed that Dimell was massing its fleets\r\nfor an all-out attack on Earth itself; confirmation of this from the\r\ncaptured scout would make Terran defensive tactics considerably more\r\nsound.\r\n\r\nBut the Dimellian resisted all forms of brainwashing until Phelps,\r\nthe Base Psych-man, came forth with the experimental thought-helmet.\r\nVolunteers were requested; Harrell spoke up first. Now, wearing\r\nthe thought-helmet, he plunged deep into the unknown areas of the\r\nDimellian\'s mind, hoping to emerge with high-order military secrets.\r\n\r\nHis first impression was of thick grey murk--so thick it could be cut.\r\nUsing a swimming motion, Harrell drifted downward, toward the light in\r\nthe distance. It was a long way down; he floated, eerily, in free-fall.\r\n\r\nFinally he touched ground. It yielded under him spongily, but it\r\nwas solid. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
He looked around. The place was alien: coarse crumbly red\r\nsoil, giant spike-leaved trees that shot up hundreds of feet overhead,\r\nbrutal-looking birds squawking and chattering in the low branches.\r\n\r\nIt looked just like the tridim solidos of Dimell he had seen. Well, why\r\nnot? Why shouldn\'t the inside of a man\'s mind--or an alien\'s, for that\r\nmatter--resemble his home world?\r\n\r\nCautiously, Harrell started to walk. Mountains rose in the dim distance\r\nand he could see, glittering on a mountaintop far beyond him, the white\r\nbulk of an armored castle. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Of course! His imaginative mind realized at\r\nonce that here was where the Dimellian guarded his precious secrets; up\r\nthere, on the mountain, was his goal.\r\n\r\nHe started to walk.\r\n\r\nLow-hanging vines obscured his way; he conjured up a machete and cut\r\nthem down. The weapon felt firm and real in his hand but he realized\r\nthat not even the hand was real; all this was but an imaginative\r\nprojection.\r\n\r\nThe castle was further away than he had thought. He saw this after he\r\nhad walked for perhaps 15 minutes. There was no telling duration inside\r\nthe alien\'s skull, either. Or distance. The castle seemed just as\r\ndistant now as when he had begun and his 15-minute journey through the\r\njungle had tired him.\r\n\r\nSuddenly demonic laughter sounded up ahead in the jungle. Harsh, ugly\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\nAnd the Dimellian appeared, slashing his way through the vines with\r\nswashbuckling abandon.\r\n\r\n"Get out of my mind, Earthman!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Dimellian was larger than life and twice as ugly. It was an\r\nidealized, self-glorified mental image Harrell faced.\r\n\r\nThe captured Dimellian was about five feet tall, thick-shouldered, with\r\nsturdy, corded arms and supplementary tentacles sprouting from its\r\nshoulders; its skin was green and leathery, dotted with toad-like warts.\r\n\r\nHarrell now saw a creature close to nine feet tall, swaggering, with a\r\nmighty barrel of a chest and a huge broad-sword clutched in one of its\r\narms. The tentacles writhed purposefully.\r\n\r\n"You know why I\'m here, alien. I want to know certain facts. And I\'m\r\nnot getting out of your mind until I\'ve wrung them from you."\r\n\r\nThe alien\'s lipless mouth curved in a bleak smile. "Big words, little\r\nEarthman. But first you\'ll have to vanquish _me_."\r\n\r\nAnd the Dimellian stepped forward.\r\n\r\nHarrell met the downcrashing blow of the alien\'s broad-sword fully; the\r\nshock of impact sent numbing shivers up his arm as far as his shoulder\r\nbut he held on and turned aside the blow. It wasn\'t fair; the Dimellian\r\nhad a vaster reach than he could ever hope for....\r\n\r\nNo! He saw there was no reason why he couldn\'t control the size of\r\nhis own mental image. Instantly he was 10 feet high and advancing\r\nremorselessly toward the alien.\r\n\r\nSwords clashed clangorously, the forest-birds screamed. Harrell drove\r\nthe alien back ... back....\r\n\r\nAnd the Dimellian was eleven feet high.\r\n\r\n"We can keep this up forever," Harrell said. "Getting larger and\r\nlarger. This is only a mental conflict." He shot up until he again\r\ntowered a foot above the alien\'s head. He swung downward two-handedly\r\nwith the machete....\r\n\r\nThe alien vanished.\r\n\r\nAnd reappeared five feet to the right, "Enough of this foolishness,\r\nEarthman. Physical conflict will be endless stalemate, since we\'re only\r\nmental projections. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
You\'re beaten; there\'s no possible way you can\r\ndefeat me, or I defeat you. Don\'t waste your time and mine. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Get out of\r\nmy mind!"\r\n\r\nHarrell shook his head doggedly. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
"I\'m in here to do a job and I\'m not\r\nleaving until I\'ve done it." He sprang forward, sword high, and thrust\r\ndown at the grinning Dimellian.\r\n\r\nAgain the Dimellian sidestepped. Harrell\'s sword cut air.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t tire yourself out, Earthman," the alien said mockingly, and\r\nvanished.\r\n\r\nHarrell stood alone in the heart of the steaming jungle, leaning on his\r\nsword. Maybe he was only a mental projection, he thought, but a mental\r\nprojection could still get thoroughly drenched with its own mental\r\nsweat.\r\n\r\nThe castle still gleamed enigmatically on the distant mountain. He\r\ncouldn\'t get there by walking--at least, it hadn\'t seemed to draw any\r\nnearer during his jaunt through the jungle. Hand-to-hand combat with\r\nthe alien appeared fruitless. A fight in which both participants could\r\nchange size at will, vanish, reappear, and do other such things was as\r\npointless as a game of poker with every card wild.\r\n\r\nBut there had to be a way. Mental attack? Perhaps _that_ would crumble\r\nthe alien\'s defenses.\r\n\r\nHe sent out a beam of thought, directed up at the castle. _Can you hear\r\nme, alien?_\r\n\r\nMental laughter echoed mockingly back. _Of course, Earthman. What\r\ntroubles you?_\r\n\r\nHarrell made no reply. He stood silently, concentrating, marshalling\r\nhis powers. Then he hurled a bolt of mental energy with all his\r\nstrength toward the mocking voice.\r\n\r\nThe jungle shuddered as it struck home. The ground lurched wildly,\r\nlike an animal\'s back; trees tumbled, the sky bent. Harrell saw he had\r\nscored a hit; the alien\'s concentration had wavered, distorting the\r\nscenery.\r\n\r\nBut there was quick recovery. Again the mocking laughter. Harrell knew\r\nthat the alien had shrugged off the blow.\r\n\r\nAnd then the counterblow.\r\n\r\nIt caught Harrell unawares and sent him spinning back a dozen feet,\r\nto land in a tangled heap beneath a dangling nest of vines. His head\r\nrocked, seemed ready to split apart. He sensed the alien readying a\r\nsecond offensive drive, and set up counterscreens.\r\n\r\nThis time he was ready. He diverted the attack easily, and shook his\r\nhead to clear it. The score was even: one stunning blow apiece. But he\r\nhad recovered and so had the alien.\r\n\r\nHarrell aimed another blow and felt the alien sweep it aside. Back came\r\nthe answering barrage of mental force; Harrell blocked it.\r\n\r\n_Stalemate again_, the alien said.\r\n\r\n_We\'re evenly matched_, Harrell replied. _But I\'ll beat you._ He looked\r\nup at the far-off castle on the mountainside. _I\'ll beat you yet._\r\n\r\n_That remains to be proven, troublesome Earthman._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHarrell tramped on through the jungle of the alien\'s mind for a while,\r\nand then, realizing he was getting no closer to the all-important\r\ncastle on the hill, stopped by a brook to wipe away his perspiration.\r\nIt was hot on this accursed world--hot, muggy, dank.\r\n\r\nHe kneeled over the water\'s surface. It looked pure, cool. A sudden\r\nthought struck him and he ripped a strip from his shirt and dipped it\r\nin the water.\r\n\r\nThe plasticloth blackened and charred. He let it drop and the "water"\r\nquickly finished the job. Pool? No. Concentrated sulphuric acid or\r\nsomething just as destructive.\r\n\r\nSmiling grimly at his narrow escape, he wiped his perspiration with\r\nanother strip torn from his sleeve and kept going. Several hours, at\r\nleast, had passed since he had entered the strange world within the\r\nalien\'s mind.\r\n\r\nThat meant one of two things: either the time-scale in here was\r\ndifferent from that outside or his half-hour limit had elapsed in the\r\nouter world and Dr. Phelps had been unsuccessful in bringing him back.\r\n\r\nThat was a nice thought. Suppose he was stuck here indefinitely, inside\r\nthe mind of an alien being, in a muggy jungle full of sulphuric acid\r\nbrooks?\r\n\r\n_Well_, he thought, _I asked for it...._\r\n\r\nThe stalemate couldn\'t continue indefinitely. If he had swallowed\r\nsome of the acid that would have ended the contest without doubt; he\r\nwouldn\'t have had time to cope with the searing fluid.\r\n\r\nThe answer lay there--_surprise_. Both he and the alien were mental\r\nentities who could do battle as they pleased--but in this conflict\r\nit was necessary to take the opponent by surprise before he could\r\ncounterthrust or vanish.\r\n\r\nHe began to see a solution.\r\n\r\nUp ahead lay the castle--unreachable, through some trick of the\r\nalien\'s. Very well. Harrell\'s brows drew together in concentration for\r\na moment; his mind planned a strategy--and formed men to carry it out.\r\n\r\nThere were six of him, suddenly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSix identical Harrells--identical in size, shape, form, purpose.\r\nThey would attack the Dimellian simultaneously. Or, at least,\r\nfive of them would, creating a diversionary action while the\r\nsixth--Harrell-original--made a frontal assault on the castle.\r\n\r\nHarrell-original faced his five duplicates and briefly instructed each\r\nin his job. They were like puppets.\r\n\r\n"Harrell-one, you\'re to attack in conjunction with Harrell-two, on the\r\nmental level. Take turns heaving mental bolts at the alien. While one\r\nof you is recharging, the other is to unload. That won\'t give him time\r\nto get any sort of defense organized and certainly no counter-attack.\r\n\r\n"Harrell-three and Harrell-four, you\'re to attack physically, one armed\r\nwith sword and one with blaster, from opposite sides at once. _That_\r\nought to keep him busy, while he\'s fighting off the rest of you.\r\n\r\n"Harrell-five, your job is to serve as front runner--to find the\r\nDimellian and engage him in conversation while the other four are\r\ngetting ready to attack. Make him angry; get him concerned about what\r\nyou\'re saying. The instant his defenses drop the other four of you jump\r\nin. All of you got that?"\r\n\r\nThey nodded in unison.\r\n\r\n"Good. Meanwhile I\'ll make an assault on the castle and maybe I can get\r\nthrough with you five running interference for me."\r\n\r\nHe dismissed them and they set out in different directions. He didn\'t\r\nwant the Dimellian to find out what was up; if the alien saw the\r\nstrategy and had time to create duplicates of its own the conflict\r\nwould end in stalemate again.\r\n\r\nHarrell waited, while his five duplicates went into action.\r\n\r\nThrough the mental link with Harrell-five, he listened as his\r\nduplicates said, "The time has come to finish you off, alien. I\'m glad\r\nI found you. That acid trick almost got me but not quite."\r\n\r\n"A pity," the alien replied. "I was hoping the ruse would finish you.\r\nIt\'s becoming quite irritating, having you in here. You\'re starting to\r\nbore me."\r\n\r\n"Just you wait, you overstuffed wart-hog. I\'ll have those tentacles of\r\nyours clipped soon enough."\r\n\r\n"Empty words, Earthman. You\'ve run out of strategies; your best course\r\nis to get out of my mind and forget this entire silly affair."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no. I\'ll have those secrets pried out of you quicker than you\r\nthink."\r\n\r\n"How?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not giving away _my_ secrets, alien. I\'m here after yours."\r\n\r\nHarrell readied himself. He gave the signal: _now_.\r\n\r\nHarrell-one and Harrell-three appeared. Harrell-one loosed a\r\nbombardment of mental force that shook the alien; Harrell-three dashed\r\nforward, wielding a machete.\r\n\r\nHarrell-two and Harrell-four went into action, Harrell-two following up\r\nwith a second mental bolt, Harrell-four firing a blaster. The bedeviled\r\nalien looked from side to side, not knowing where to defend himself\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nThe scenery began to rock. The alien was going down.\r\n\r\nHarrell took to the air.\r\n\r\nLevitating easily above the jungle, he found the castle and zeroed\r\nin on it. As he dropped downward it changed--from a vaulting proud\r\ncollection of spires and battlements to a blocky square building and\r\nfrom that into an armored box with a padlock.\r\n\r\nThe Dimellian stood before it, struggling with the five duplicate\r\nHarrells.\r\n\r\nHarrell stepped past--_through_--the writhing group. The Dimellian\'s\r\ndefenses were down. The secrets were unguarded.\r\n\r\nHe wrenched the padlock off with a contemptuous twist of his hand. The\r\nbox sprang open. Inside lay documents, neatly typed, ready for his eye.\r\n\r\nThe alien uttered a mighty howl. The forest dissolved; the universe\r\nswirled around Harrell\'s head.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe woke. It seemed to be months later.\r\n\r\nDr. Phelps stood by his side.\r\n\r\nHarrell took two or three deep breaths, clearing his head. He grinned.\r\n"I\'ve got them," he said. "Information on troop movements, plan of\r\nbattle, even the line of journey across space."\r\n\r\n"Good work," the psychman said. "I was worried at first. You had some\r\nexpressions of real terror on your face when you put the helmet on."\r\n\r\n"Dead?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid so.

=== Chunk 8 ===
"\r\n\r\nHarrell grinned weakly. "I guess I was just too many for him. The shock\r\nof having the core of his mind penetrated--" Tiredly he said, "Doc, how\r\ncome you didn\'t get me out at the half-hour mark?"\r\n\r\n"Eh?"\r\n\r\n"I told you to pull me out after half an hour had gone by. Why didn\'t\r\nyou? I was in there half a day, at least--and I might have stayed there\r\nforever."\r\n\r\nThe psychman was looking at him strangely. "Half a day, you say? 

=== Chunk 9 ===
No,\r\nLieutenant Harrell. The total time elapsed from the moment you donned\r\nthe helmet to the instant the alien screamed--why, it was less than 10\r\nseconds!"\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
