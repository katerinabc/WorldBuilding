DICK\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was quite by accident I discovered this incredible invasion of\r\nEarth by lifeforms from another planet. As yet, I haven\'t done\r\nanything about it; I can\'t think of anything to do. I wrote to the\r\nGovernment, and they sent back a pamphlet on the repair and\r\nmaintenance of frame houses. Anyhow, the whole thing is known; I\'m not\r\nthe first to discover it. Maybe it\'s even under control.\r\n\r\nI was sitting in my easy-chair, idly turning the pages of a\r\npaperbacked book someone had left on the bus, when I came across the\r\nreference that first put me on the trail. For a moment I didn\'t\r\nrespond. It took some time for the full import to sink in. After I\'d\r\ncomprehended, it seemed odd I hadn\'t noticed it right away.\r\n\r\nThe reference was clearly to a nonhuman species of incredible\r\nproperties, not indigenous to Earth. A species, I hasten to point out,\r\ncustomarily masquerading as ordinary human beings. Their disguise,\r\nhowever, became transparent in the face of the following observations\r\nby the author. It was at once obvious the author knew everything. Knew\r\neverything--and was taking it in his stride. The line (and I tremble\r\nremembering it even now) read:\r\n\r\n    _... his eyes slowly roved about the room._\r\n\r\nVague chills assailed me. I tried to picture the eyes. Did they roll\r\nlike dimes? The passage indicated not; they seemed to move through the\r\nair, not over the surface. Rather rapidly, apparently. No one in the\r\nstory was surprised. That\'s what tipped me off. No sign of amazement\r\nat such an outrageous thing. Later the matter was amplified.\r\n\r\n    _... his eyes moved from person to person._\r\n\r\nThere it was in a nutshell. The eyes had clearly come apart from the\r\nrest of him and were on their own. My heart pounded and my breath\r\nchoked in my windpipe. I had stumbled on an accidental mention of a\r\ntotally unfamiliar race. Obviously non-Terrestrial. Yet, to the\r\ncharacters in the book, it was perfectly natural--which suggested they\r\nbelonged to the same species.\r\n\r\nAnd the author? A slow suspicion burned in my mind. The author was\r\ntaking it rather _too easily_ in his stride. Evidently, he felt this\r\nwas quite a usual thing.

He made absolutely no attempt to conceal this\r\nknowledge. The story continued:\r\n\r\n    _... presently his eyes fastened on Julia._\r\n\r\nJulia, being a lady, had at least the breeding to feel indignant. She\r\nis described as blushing and knitting her brows angrily. At this, I\r\nsighed with relief. They weren\'t _all_ non-Terrestrials. The narrative\r\ncontinues:\r\n\r\n    _... slowly, calmly, his eyes examined every inch of her._\r\n\r\nGreat Scott! But here the girl turned and stomped off and the matter\r\nended. I lay back in my chair gasping with horror. My wife and family\r\nregarded me in wonder.\r\n\r\n"What\'s wrong, dear?" my wife asked.\r\n\r\nI couldn\'t tell her. Knowledge like this was too much for the ordinary\r\nrun-of-the-mill person. I had to keep it to myself. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
"Nothing," I\r\ngasped. I leaped up, snatched the book, and hurried out of the room.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the garage, I continued reading. There was more. Trembling, I read\r\nthe next revealing passage:\r\n\r\n    _... he put his arm around Julia. Presently she asked him if\r\n    he would remove his arm. He immediately did so, with a smile._\r\n\r\nIt\'s not said what was done with the arm after the fellow had removed\r\nit. Maybe it was left standing upright in the corner. Maybe it was\r\nthrown away. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
I don\'t care. In any case, the full meaning was there,\r\nstaring me right in the face.\r\n\r\nHere was a race of creatures capable of removing portions of their\r\nanatomy at will. Eyes, arms--and maybe more. Without batting an\r\neyelash. My knowledge of biology came in handy, at this point.\r\nObviously they were simple beings, uni-cellular, some sort of\r\nprimitive single-celled things. Beings no more developed than\r\nstarfish. Starfish can do the same thing, you know.\r\n\r\nI read on. And came to this incredible revelation, tossed off coolly\r\nby the author without the faintest tremor:\r\n\r\n    _... outside the movie theater we split up. Part of us went\r\n    inside, part over to the cafe for dinner._\r\n\r\nBinary fission, obviously. Splitting in half and forming two entities.\r\nProbably each lower half went to the cafe, it being farther, and the\r\nupper halves to the movies. I read on, hands shaking. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
I had really\r\nstumbled onto something here. My mind reeled as I made out this\r\npassage:\r\n\r\n    _... I\'m afraid there\'s no doubt about it. Poor Bibney has\r\n    lost his head again._\r\n\r\nWhich was followed by:\r\n\r\n    _... and Bob says he has utterly no guts._\r\n\r\nYet Bibney got around as well as the next person. The next person,\r\nhowever, was just as strange. He was soon described as:\r\n\r\n    _... totally lacking in brains._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt of the thing in the next passage. Julia, whom I had\r\nthought to be the one normal person, reveals herself as also being an\r\nalien life form, similar to the rest:\r\n\r\n    _... quite deliberately, Julia had given her heart to the\r\n    young man._\r\n\r\nIt didn\'t relate what the final disposition of the organ was, but I\r\ndidn\'t really care. It was evident Julia had gone right on living in\r\nher usual manner, like all the others in the book. Without heart,\r\narms, eyes, brains, viscera, dividing up in two when the occasion\r\ndemanded. Without a qualm.\r\n\r\n    _... thereupon she gave him her hand._\r\n\r\nI sickened. The rascal now had her hand, as well as her heart. I\r\nshudder to think what he\'s done with them, by this time.\r\n\r\n    _... he took her arm._\r\n\r\nNot content to wait, he had to start dismantling her on his own.\r\nFlushing crimson, I slammed the book shut and leaped to my feet. But\r\nnot in time to escape one last reference to those carefree bits of\r\nanatomy whose travels had originally thrown me on the track:\r\n\r\n    _... her eyes followed him all the way down the road and\r\n    across the meadow._\r\n\r\nI rushed from the garage and back inside the warm house, as if the\r\naccursed things were following me. My wife and children were playing\r\nMonopoly in the kitchen. I joined them and played with frantic fervor,\r\nbrow feverish, teeth chattering.\r\n\r\nI had had enough of the thing. I want to hear no more about it. Let\r\nthem come on. Let them invade Earth. I don\'t want to get mixed up in\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI have absolutely no stomach for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
