=== Chunk 2 ===
]\r\n\r\n\r\nBarstac walked the mile across the red Martian plain. He felt but\r\nlittle emotion as he reached the resort building, and the sports\r\nrockets waiting on the other side. He had to get one of those rockets\r\nand get to Deimos--or die trying. One would be about as good as the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThen a slight tension grew in his stomach and sweat began to run down\r\nunder his helmet and pressure suit, down his sharp nose and the burned\r\nface, as he started directly for the sports rockets.\r\n\r\nHe saw no one at all at first, then the gray-and-black-uniformed cop\r\nnot ten feet away. The cop\'s helmet tilted and curious eyes studied\r\nBarstac. Barstac didn\'t wait for any further reaction; his face pulled\r\ninto a tight scarred grin as he fired. The kinetic energy release\r\nburned away the side of the cop\'s head. A scream floated past from some\r\nonlooker, intensified by the communicator in Barstac\'s helmet.\r\n\r\nBarstac ran. He was almost to one of the rockets and exhilaration\r\nfilled him. He sensed an alien thing, so alien--freedom. Maybe freedom\r\njust for a while. Then he heard shouts and saw men running in like\r\nspokes into a wheel hub. He threw himself flat behind a loading truck\r\nsomeone had abandoned enroute to a supply rocket.\r\n\r\nSuperson guns. They wouldn\'t kill him ... against the law to kill\r\ncriminals in the New System. More civilized to turn men into zombies\r\nfor the rest of their lives in a mine three miles underground; they had\r\nto take him alive. A superson gun put a man out of action fast, but it\r\ndidn\'t kill him. Sound waves tuned right could crack a man\'s helmet\r\nopen; in Martian atmosphere that meant unconsciousness in a few seconds.\r\n\r\nIf they got a line on him he wouldn\'t have a chance to use his heat\r\ngun. He didn\'t intend to be taken. He\'d get a few of them, and then\r\nhave enough heat left to turn on himself.\r\n\r\nBarstac shivered as part of the metal truck spanged and cracked like\r\nglass. They\'d got a line on him all right, fast. He fired and three men\r\nturned into smoke and red steam. The others disappeared behind rockets,\r\nsleds, and out-buildings; they could take their time.\r\n\r\nA face appeared to his right. A man trying to edge away, but then he\r\nstopped. A tourist in a dude suit, all spangled and glittery, styled to\r\nthe minute for Martian hunting. A face, young and pinched and shabby\r\nwith fear. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
His arms dangled limply. His lips behind the helmet were\r\ntight with terror.\r\n\r\n"Wait--" his voice sounded through the communicator. "Wait--please\r\ndon\'t shoot! I\'m unarmed. I won\'t--"\r\n\r\nBarstac grinned. A gag. The guy took a step back and Barstac fired. A\r\nlight charge right through the belly. The man folded to one side, his\r\nmouth stretching, closing, opening. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
He grasped his middle and blood ran\r\nthrough his fingers. He was on his knees, raising a red hand.\r\n\r\n"Wait--don\'t--"\r\n\r\nBarstac\'s next charge was heavier and it took off the man\'s head and\r\nhelmet in a burst of flame.\r\n\r\nBarstac was on his feet, long legs straining desperately, running.\r\nThe sleek blue sports rocket slid across his path on its grav-plates.\r\nFar beyond it rose the high cubed buildings of the City of Sanskran\r\nlooking very near although it was at least fifty miles away.\r\n\r\nA woman\'s face stared out at him through the rocket\'s translucent\r\nnose, a beautiful face inside a platinum helmet. Barstac didn\'t stop\r\nto think; he leaped upward, swung himself to the top of the rocket\'s\r\nskin and pressed the stud that should open the cockpit. He grabbed\r\ndesperately.\r\n\r\nHe screamed as he felt his helmet crack; they\'d gotten a line. The\r\nfrigid cold clutched his face. He choked for oxygen, tried to yell. He\r\nstaggered back and collapsed across the top of the rocket.\r\n\r\nHe buried the opening on top of his helmet in his arms, released all\r\navailable oxygen. It gave him a few seconds, but he couldn\'t move.\r\nHe dimly saw the girl raise up through the cockpit. Nothing made any\r\nsense then. She had the heat gun in her hand and was firing. She was\r\nlifting him, throwing him over her shoulder, carrying him back toward\r\nthe cockpit!\r\n\r\nIn this light gravity it wasn\'t a feat of strength. But it made no\r\nsense to Barstac. None at all. A woman he\'d never seen, saving him. For\r\nwhat?\r\n\r\nAll the lights went out then. Barstac stopped being curious....\r\n\r\nIt was very still--somewhere. Very still.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPhobos shine came in through the plastex of the rocket and the controls\r\nwere quiet in front of him. A dead sea bottom stretched away outside\r\nas far as anyone would want to see. Lichen and fungus, and a few of\r\nthose big blind Martian beetles wandering, following the direction of\r\nthe hurtling moon. And then Barstac saw Deimos rising, shining like a\r\nmonstrous beckoning firefly through the night.\r\n\r\nHe felt a terrible lassitude. He just sat there, his head against the\r\nplastex looking out. He knew he wasn\'t alone in the rocket, but he\r\ndidn\'t look at who was beside him; he stared upward at Deimos.\r\n\r\nFor ten years in that Martian Prison for Incorrigibles, he had planned\r\nescape. And the only escape was to Deimos. Once, a man could escape\r\ninto the unlimited expanse of the stars; but in the New System, the\r\nnets were too tight.\r\n\r\nThe eery light of the double moons bathed the rocket as the larger moon\r\njoined the smaller. Deimos was his only hope, if any remained. There,\r\nthey said, a man neither lived, nor died, ever again. The Martians were\r\nkind, people said. But who really knew?\r\n\r\nThe Martians had retired quietly to Deimos when the Earthmen came\r\nto Mars. They had a peculiar alien culture, nebulous and utterly\r\ninhuman. With their floating, wispy, mist-like shapes that suggested\r\nincomputable age, shapes the moons could shine through, and their\r\nfog cities. No one bothered them on Deimos, a barren rock even Earth\r\nCompanies couldn\'t justify exploiting. But the Martians had peculiar\r\nabilities. Inhuman they were, but they seemed to have great influence\r\nover the human mind and the nervous system. On Deimos, it was said,\r\nthere were dreams for a man who had nothing else; anyone, even a\r\nman like Barstac, was safe on Deimos. Few ever came back from where\r\nonly the lost went. And those who did come back, it was said, didn\'t\r\nremember.\r\n\r\nAnd for Barstac certainly there was no place else to go.\r\n\r\nNow, through circumstances beyond him, he had a rocket; he was away\r\nfrom the cops, and seemingly free. The girl--\r\n\r\nHis helmet had been removed. Out of the corner of his eye he watched\r\nthe girl secretly in the other pilot seat, calmly smoking a paraette.\r\nBarstac saw the heat gun in her lap. He had a fondness for the weapon;\r\nit had taken him ten years to piece it together. The psyche boys at\r\nthe prison with their intricate scanners had made a mistake with\r\nBarstac--maybe the only one they\'d ever made since the New System,\r\nbut even they weren\'t infallible; they hadn\'t uncovered his inventive\r\nability, even though he\'d always had it. They had put him in the shops\r\ndown among the power tools and the atomic machines. Ten years was a\r\nlong time to build a simple heat gun; it had taken patience.\r\n\r\nHis hand darted out fast, hooked the heat gun from her lap. She gasped,\r\nthen sank back again and looked at him. She wore the regular sports\r\noutfit, the helmet, the thigh boots. An expensive piece of blonde\r\ngoods, very expensive, with an oval face and pointed chin, skin light\r\nand very clear. She gave him a slow steady look that was like turning\r\non a cyclotron. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Her lithe figure reminded him. Sure, there\'d been\r\nother--but so long ago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Barstac\'s hand darted out fast, hooked the heat gun\r\nfrom her lap.]\r\n\r\n"You can put the gun away," she said calmly. "Didn\'t I save your life?\r\nThere may be trouble for me, but Daddy Sayers can always buy his\r\ndaughter out of trouble. My name\'s Marian Sayers. Whatever it costs,\r\nthe excitement\'s worth it!"\r\n\r\nSayers! When Barstac had been imprisoned ten years ago, Sayers had been\r\none of the richest robber barons in the system. Probably the richest by\r\nnow. What would Marian Sayers want with Barstac?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShe laughed. It had a wild, odd sound. Her face had a wild look, too.\r\n"I heard someone say \'Barstac\'," she said. "And then I had to get you\r\nout of there."\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"You were the most infamous man in history when I was a little girl; I\r\nused to dream about you. And all at once, there was an old dream, and\r\nI could make it come true, so I did. All the credits in the world to\r\nspend, and dying of boredom. I\'ve tried everything, and found nothing\r\nat all, Barstac."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve tried--Deimos?"\r\n\r\n"Even Deimos. No one knowing of course. But--well, they have some\r\npretty interesting things, but still only dreams. This is reality,\r\nBarstac. Karl Barstac. I can call you Karl. I\'ll get out if you want\r\nand you can take my rocket. But--please! 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Take me with you!"\r\n\r\nThe vital animal warmth of her reached out to him and he put his arms\r\naround her and drew her close against him. He looked into her eyes and\r\nit was as if he looked into a book that was forbidden to him because\r\nof hidden secrets. His pulse pounded. She watched him mutely, only her\r\nparted lips trembled slightly. A small muscle at the corner of her\r\nmouth twitched. He slid his hands flat against her shoulders. Her lips\r\nparted and her tongue touched them for a moment. They were wet and\r\nglistening and she was firm and warm in his arms. Her head went back\r\nand she shut her eyes. He kissed her.\r\n\r\nIt was all right, he thought; then he looked above her blonde hair.\r\nShe was probably cracked somewhere upstairs; filled with phony dreams\r\nof adventure and glamour and the devil knew what; intrigued by the\r\nname of a guy who really didn\'t live anymore. Maybe she didn\'t know it,\r\ndidn\'t see the graying hair of him the way he saw it, nor the face so\r\nscarred it couldn\'t register emotion any more.\r\n\r\nAnd if nothing else, she was good for a hostage. It was still a long\r\nway up to Deimos.\r\n\r\n"Maybe we can get away," she whispered, her eyes closed. "I mean into\r\nspace. Maybe you could do some of the things you did in the old days.\r\nWe could live--for a while. I heard that once you stopped a ship\r\nenroute to Venus and lifted twenty billion in credits."\r\n\r\nSure, he remembered. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
He smiled thinly, but he didn\'t say anything. He\r\ndidn\'t tell her that the days of the Barstacs were gone for good.\r\n\r\nFinally he said, "Sure, you can come along. And thanks for the ride."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe took the rocket up himself. They were pursued for a while, but the\r\nsports rocket was a lot faster than any cop wagon this side of Earth.\r\nMarian didn\'t seem to care when she saw he was heading for Deimos\r\ninstead of outer space. He explained about the big nets out there, and\r\nof how they\'d have to figure out a way to get through. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
She kept looking\r\nat him with a kind of awe, her eyes wide and deeply dark. She talked\r\nabout herself.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll hole up here for a while," Barstac said. "Maybe we can find a\r\nway through the nets. You--you don\'t have to stay."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll stay with you, Karl, right to the end."\r\n\r\n"You say you\'ve been here to Deimos before?"\r\n\r\nShe nodded, never taking her eyes from his hard, unemotional face. "All\r\nmy life I guess I\'ve been looking for something. Maybe I thought I\'d\r\nfind it on Deimos. I didn\'t; I found release there. I can find real\r\nlife with you, maybe the kind that flames so high for a moment, but is\r\nworth a full lifetime of mundanity. I can find life with you, Karl, if\r\nyou\'ll pardon my being so forward. Maybe it\'s death we\'re looking for,\r\nKarl. An escape from a system that\'s destroyed initiative. A system\r\nthat\'s tied up the human heart in a bunch of laws and hooked them\r\ntogether into a big machine."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDeimos. A great barren rock, its soaring crags sharp as splintered\r\nsteel. Masses of shadow dark as death, and splashes of brilliant color.\r\nAnd you spotted one of those misty, foggy looking Martian places here\r\nand there, wavering like something in a dream.\r\n\r\nFrom the time the rocket settled on its grav-plates, from that moment\r\non, things turned into a dream for Barstac. Marian seemed to know her\r\nway around. Not many had the guts to leave here once they came; but\r\nshe had. A strong will there. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
An odd woman. One he would liked to have\r\nknown--yesterday.\r\n\r\nThere was the music and the vapor that lulled him into lethargy,\r\nsomething like sleep, only it wasn\'t sleep. There seemed to be rooms,\r\nshifting, vague, translucent. And figures drifting like mist. He seemed\r\nto hear voices, but they were inside him, high, thin, like the sighing\r\nof plucked strings whispering in a low, dreaming distant key.\r\n\r\nHe heard Marian Sayer whisper. "Might as well enjoy it while we\'re\r\nhere. There are dreams here, many dreams, Karl. Any you want. Rest a\r\nwhile, Karl, rest and sleep and later we\'ll plan what to do."\r\n\r\n_Yes, sure_, he thought vaguely. _That\'s why I\'m here, no not that. I\'m\r\nhere because this is the end of the rocky road, and no further for me._\r\nHe was drifting, sinking away, floating. He dimly saw her face above\r\nhim, disembodied, her eyes strangely bright. The Martians were masters\r\nof something called mnemonics, he knew that. Masters of mental probing\r\nand the digging out of memory. Hypnosis or something like it, but way\r\nbeyond that.\r\n\r\nHe was in a Martian city in a valley on Deimos, somewhere in a\r\nbuilding, in a room. But he would never know the real shape of it, or\r\nwhat it really was.\r\n\r\nHer voice whispered. "Karl--they understand humans; they don\'t hate us.\r\nThey understand us better than we will ever understand ourselves. They\r\nknow what we really want deep inside, and they can give us whatever it\r\nis. Don\'t worry about anything, Karl. I was here for a while, and I\r\nknow about the dreams. I\'ll fix everything for you."\r\n\r\n"Fine," he murmured. He was lying somewhere, he was\r\nfloating--somewhere. It didn\'t matter where, not any more. Far away he\r\nheard her voice now. "Were you ever happy, Karl?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t remember. Happiness?" He tried to laugh.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you remember happiness, Karl?"\r\n\r\nHe whispered to her of things he had forgotten. Shadows and shapes\r\nappeared in the cloudy whiteness, ghostly and strange. Wavering\r\noutlines darkened and altered. He remembered. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
He hadn\'t for a long\r\ntime, but he did now. In the asteroids where his Father had been a\r\nmucker, mining heavy beryllium, paired-atom stuff. And his Mother\r\ncalling to him and he was running, laughing. Happiness. That was a long\r\ntime back, and that was where happiness ended.\r\n\r\nThat was when the cops came and tried to take his Father for mining\r\nillegally and he had resisted. That was in the Old System, and they had\r\nshot him with an electron rifle. His body exploding, spraying the cold\r\nrocks with red and awful memory. And his Mother screaming and running,\r\nfalling, drifting down a thousand feet into darkness, her screams\r\nfading ... fading....\r\n\r\nMarian\'s voice came to him, softly. Music sang too, poignant, eery.\r\nCaressing, gentle, and indefinably sad.\r\n\r\n"Poor Karl," she whispered. "Poor Karl." Dimly he saw her face, like a\r\npart of mist, and then he saw the gun reaching toward him out of the\r\nvapor.\r\n\r\nInstinctively he started to reach for it, but he couldn\'t move.\r\nDrugged. He whispered. He felt very tired, tired and old. "What\'s the\r\nplay? What--"\r\n\r\n"I\'m going to kill you, Karl."\r\n\r\n"Kill me--"\r\n\r\n"I felt sorry for you; I still do. But not sorry enough. I decided to\r\nkill you back there on Mars, and then when you came here, I thought\r\nof something else. I thought you would reveal something, something\r\nthat would justify what you are. There wasn\'t enough. You never had a\r\nchance, Karl. You knew happiness, but it was too long ago. We\'re alone\r\nin this room, left to our dreams. But I\'m not dreaming."\r\n\r\n"I wish I was," Barstac said.\r\n\r\n"I thought that here something would show inside of you so I wouldn\'t\r\nhate you so much. But I do. I hate you more than I can tell you. But\r\nit\'s enough so that I have to kill you."\r\n\r\n"Why?" he whispered.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"I hate you so much that I wanted to kill you. I knew if the police got\r\nyou, you wouldn\'t die. And I think death is a worse thing for you under\r\nthe circumstances than to be returned to prison. So I got you out of\r\nthere. I knew that sometime I would get a chance to kill you. So here\r\nit is. You\'re dreaming, Karl. But I\'m not--I--"\r\n\r\n"All that--the things you said--you were lying?"\r\n\r\n"Partly. You were a romantic figure once, and what I said about\r\nmyself--that was only the way it used to be. The Martians are\r\ntherapists, in a way. If you want to leave you can, but for most the\r\ndreams are better. I left. I began to live, then, Karl. I married two\r\nweeks ago. It was a beautiful thing for me; I loved my husband. But you\r\nwouldn\'t understand. You never got a chance to learn. My husband was\r\nthe man you killed down there by the truck. Remember, Karl. The man who\r\nwas unarmed, who didn\'t know what it was all about, who begged you not\r\nto kill him? We came to Mars for our honeymoon, Karl. I was waiting for\r\nhim in the rocket. He was coming to meet me--"\r\n\r\nHer finger moved. Her face tightened. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
But he didn\'t feel anything. He\r\nheard her muted cry and then the voice as the Martian he had seen only\r\nvaguely before came back. The shape wavered ghost-like from the corner,\r\nand he heard the Martian again.\r\n\r\n_This is not a place for the old emotions. There is no revenge here. No\r\ndeath._\r\n\r\nShe screamed and screamed, her face twisting with hate. "I want to kill\r\nhim! 

=== Chunk 12 ===
Let me, let me--!"\r\n\r\nThe Martian\'s thoughts were so calm and gentle, so old and wise.\r\n_Relax, and sleep for a while. Maybe this time you\'ll want to stay with\r\nus here forever._\r\n\r\nShe didn\'t answer. Barstac closed his eyes again. He had remembered\r\nhappiness, felt it, re-experienced it. And now he didn\'t want to die.\r\n\r\nThe Martian\'s thoughts were dimmer now, and Barstac drifted, and\r\nlittle fingers of crepuscular light fingered out toward him, alluring,\r\ndisarming, and he drifted back, down the slide-board of time where pain\r\nand ugliness were no longer.\r\n\r\nFar away, the Martian\'s voice, talking to Marian perhaps, Barstac\r\ndidn\'t know.\r\n\r\n_Humans are sick. The sickest ones eventually come here. 

=== Chunk 13 ===
More and\r\nmore will come. Someday perhaps we can help all of you find your way\r\nbackward or forward to happiness, and out of the old seas of pain.\r\nSleep, both of you. Sleep. 

=== Chunk 14 ===
There is only the happiness that was, or\r\nthat might have been. There is no more pain._\r\n\r\nAnd then Barstac was with his Father again, running down the steep\r\nslope under the bright promising light of a million stars frosty and\r\nmarvelously clear. His Father was laughing. His own wild abandoned\r\njoy as he ran beneath the cloud rifts where the sunlight showed,\r\nbrightening the ragged tops of the asteroid\'s great metal mountains.\r\n\r\nHe heard his mother calling to him, and he ran faster.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
