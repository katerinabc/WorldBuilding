To read a book. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
Not\r\njust the title or the preface, or a page somewhere in the middle. He\r\nwanted to read the whole thing, all the way through from beginning to\r\nend. A simple ambition perhaps, but in the cluttered life of Henry\r\nBemis, an impossibility.\r\n\r\nHenry had no time of his own. There was his wife, Agnes who owned that\r\npart of it that his employer, Mr. Carsville, did not buy. Henry was\r\nallowed enough to get to and from work--that in itself being quite a\r\nconcession on Agnes\' part.\r\n\r\nAlso, nature had conspired against Henry by handing him with a pair of\r\nhopelessly myopic eyes. Poor Henry literally couldn\'t see his hand in\r\nfront of his face. For a while, when he was very young, his parents\r\nhad thought him an idiot. When they realized it was his eyes, they got\r\nglasses for him. He was never quite able to catch up. There was never\r\nenough time. It looked as though Henry\'s ambition would never be\r\nrealized. Then something happened which changed all that.\r\n\r\nHenry was down in the vault of the Eastside Bank & Trust when it\r\nhappened. He had stolen a few moments from the duties of his teller\'s\r\ncage to try to read a few pages of the magazine he had bought that\r\nmorning. He\'d made an excuse to Mr. Carsville about needing bills in\r\nlarge denominations for a certain customer, and then, safe inside the\r\ndim recesses of the vault he had pulled from inside his coat the\r\npocket size magazine.\r\n\r\nHe had just started a picture article cheerfully entitled "The New\r\nWeapons and What They\'ll Do To YOU", when all the noise in the world\r\ncrashed in upon his ear-drums. It seemed to be inside of him and\r\noutside of him all at once. Then the concrete floor was rising up at\r\nhim and the ceiling came slanting down toward him, and for a fleeting\r\nsecond Henry thought of a story he had started to read once called\r\n"The Pit and The Pendulum". He regretted in that insane moment that he\r\nhad never had time to finish that story to see how it came out. Then\r\nall was darkness and quiet and unconsciousness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Henry came to, he knew that something was desperately wrong with\r\nthe Eastside Bank & Trust. The heavy steel door of the vault was\r\nbuckled and twisted and the floor tilted up at a dizzy angle, while\r\nthe ceiling dipped crazily toward it. Henry gingerly got to his feet,\r\nmoving arms and legs experimentally. Assured that nothing was broken,\r\nhe tenderly raised a hand to his eyes. His precious glasses were\r\nintact, thank God! He would never have been able to find his way out\r\nof the shattered vault without them.\r\n\r\nHe made a mental note to write Dr. Torrance to have a spare pair made\r\nand mailed to him. Blasted nuisance not having his prescription on\r\nfile locally, but Henry trusted no-one but Dr. Torrance to grind those\r\nthick lenses into his own complicated prescription. Henry removed the\r\nheavy glasses from his face. Instantly the room dissolved into a\r\nneutral blur. Henry saw a pink splash that he knew was his hand, and a\r\nwhite blob come up to meet the pink as he withdrew his pocket\r\nhandkerchief and carefully dusted the lenses. As he replaced the\r\nglasses, they slipped down on the bridge of his nose a little. He had\r\nbeen meaning to have them tightened for some time.\r\n\r\nHe suddenly realized, without the realization actually entering his\r\nconscious thoughts, that something momentous had happened, something\r\nworse than the boiler blowing up, something worse than a gas main\r\nexploding, something worse than anything that had ever happened\r\nbefore. He felt that way because it was so quiet. There was no whine\r\nof sirens, no shouting, no running, just an ominous and all pervading\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHenry walked across the slanting floor. Slipping and stumbling on the\r\nuneven surface, he made his way to the elevator. The car lay crumpled\r\nat the foot of the shaft like a discarded accordian. There was\r\nsomething inside of it that Henry could not look at, something that\r\nhad once been a person, or perhaps several people, it was impossible\r\nto tell now.\r\n\r\nFeeling sick, Henry staggered toward the stairway. The steps were\r\nstill there, but so jumbled and piled back upon one another that it\r\nwas more like climbing the side of a mountain than mounting a\r\nstairway. It was quiet in the huge chamber that had been the lobby of\r\nthe bank. It looked strangely cheerful with the sunlight shining\r\nthrough the girders where the ceiling had fallen. The dappled sunlight\r\nglinted across the silent lobby, and everywhere there were huddled\r\nlumps of unpleasantness that made Henry sick as he tried not to look\r\nat them.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Carsville," he called. It was very quiet. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Something had to be\r\ndone, of course. This was terrible, right in the middle of a Monday,\r\ntoo. Mr. Carsville would know what to do. He called again, more\r\nloudly, and his voice cracked hoarsely, "Mr. Carrrrsville!" And then\r\nhe saw an arm and shoulder extending out from under a huge fallen\r\nblock of marble ceiling. In the buttonhole was the white carnation Mr.\r\nCarsville had worn to work that morning, and on the third finger of\r\nthat hand was a massive signet ring, also belonging to Mr. Carsville.\r\nNumbly, Henry realized that the rest of Mr. Carsville was under that\r\nblock of marble.\r\n\r\nHenry felt a pang of real sorrow. Mr. Carsville was gone, and so was\r\nthe rest of the staff--Mr. Wilkinson and Mr.

Emory and Mr.

Prithard,\r\nand the same with Pete and Ralph and Jenkins and Hunter and Pat the\r\nguard and Willie the doorman. There was no one to say what was to be\r\ndone about the Eastside Bank & Trust except Henry Bemis, and Henry\r\nwasn\'t worried about the bank, there was something he wanted to do.\r\n\r\nHe climbed carefully over piles of fallen masonry. Once he stepped\r\ndown into something that crunched and squashed beneath his feet and he\r\nset his teeth on edge to keep from retching. The street was not much\r\ndifferent from the inside, bright sunlight and so much concrete to\r\ncrawl over, but the unpleasantness was much, much worse. Everywhere\r\nthere were strange, motionless lumps that Henry could not look at.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, he remembered Agnes. He should be trying to get to Agnes,\r\nshouldn\'t he? He remembered a poster he had seen that said, "In event\r\nof emergency do not use the telephone, your loved ones are as safe as\r\nyou." He wondered about Agnes. He looked at the smashed automobiles,\r\nsome with their four wheels pointing skyward like the stiffened legs\r\nof dead animals. He couldn\'t get to Agnes now anyway, if she was safe,\r\nthen, she was safe, otherwise ... of course, Henry knew Agnes wasn\'t\r\nsafe. He had a feeling that there wasn\'t anyone safe for a long, long\r\nway, maybe not in the whole state or the whole country, or the whole\r\nworld. No, that was a thought Henry didn\'t want to think, he forced it\r\nfrom his mind and turned his thoughts back to Agnes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShe had been a pretty good wife, now that it was all said and done. It\r\nwasn\'t exactly her fault if people didn\'t have time to read nowadays.\r\nIt was just that there was the house, and the bank, and the yard.\r\nThere were the Jones\' for bridge and the Graysons\' for canasta and\r\ncharades with the Bryants. And the television, the television Agnes\r\nloved to watch, but would never watch alone. He never had time to read\r\neven a newspaper. He started thinking about last night, that business\r\nabout the newspaper.\r\n\r\nHenry had settled into his chair, quietly, afraid that a creaking\r\nspring might call to Agnes\' attention the fact that he was momentarily\r\nunoccupied. He had unfolded the newspaper slowly and carefully, the\r\nsharp crackle of the paper would have been a clarion call to Agnes. He\r\nhad glanced at the headlines of the first page. "Collapse Of\r\nConference Imminent." He didn\'t have time to read the article. He\r\nturned to the second page. "Solon Predicts War Only Days Away." He\r\nflipped through the pages faster, reading brief snatches here and\r\nthere, afraid to spend too much time on any one item. On a back page\r\nwas a brief article entitled, "Prehistoric Artifacts Unearthed In\r\nYucatan". Henry smiled to himself and carefully folded the sheet of\r\npaper into fourths. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
That would be interesting, he would read all of\r\nit. Then it came, Agnes\' voice. "Henrrreee!" 

=== Chunk 7 ===
And then she was upon\r\nhim. She lightly flicked the paper out of his hands and into the\r\nfireplace. He saw the flames lick up and curl possessively around the\r\nunread article. Agnes continued, "Henry, tonight is the Jones\' bridge\r\nnight. They\'ll be here in thirty minutes and I\'m not dressed yet, and\r\nhere you are ... 

=== Chunk 8 ===
_reading_." She had emphasized the last word as\r\nthough it were an unclean act. "Hurry and shave, you know how smooth\r\nJasper Jones\' chin always looks, and then straighten up this room."\r\nShe glanced regretfully toward the fireplace. "Oh dear, that paper,\r\nthe television schedule ... oh well, after the Jones leave there won\'t\r\nbe time for anything but the late-late movie and.... Don\'t just sit\r\nthere, Henry, hurrreeee!"\r\n\r\nHenry was hurrying now, but hurrying too much. He cut his leg on a\r\ntwisted piece of metal that had once been an automobile fender. He\r\nthought about things like lock-jaw and gangrene and his hand trembled\r\nas he tied his pocket-handkerchief around the wound. In his mind, he\r\nsaw the fire again, licking across the face of last night\'s newspaper.\r\nHe thought that now he would have time to read all the newspapers he\r\nwanted to, only now there wouldn\'t be any more. That heap of rubble\r\nacross the street had been the Gazette Building. It was terrible to\r\nthink there would never be another up to date newspaper. Agnes would\r\nhave been very upset, no television schedule. But then, of course, no\r\ntelevision. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
He wanted to laugh but he didn\'t. That wouldn\'t have been\r\nfitting, not at all.\r\n\r\nHe could see the building he was looking for now, but the silhouette\r\nwas strangely changed. The great circular dome was now a ragged\r\nsemi-circle, half of it gone, and one of the great wings of the\r\nbuilding had fallen in upon itself. A sudden panic gripped Henry\r\nBemis. What if they were all ruined, destroyed, every one of them?\r\nWhat if there wasn\'t a single one left? Tears of helplessness welled\r\nin his eyes as he painfully fought his way over and through the\r\ntwisted fragments of the city.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe thought of the building when it had been whole. He remembered the\r\nmany nights he had paused outside its wide and welcoming doors. He\r\nthought of the warm nights when the doors had been thrown open and he\r\ncould see the people inside, see them sitting at the plain wooden\r\ntables with the stacks of books beside them. He used to think then,\r\nwhat a wonderful thing a public library was, a place where anybody,\r\nanybody at all could go in and read.\r\n\r\nHe had been tempted to enter many times. He had watched the people\r\nthrough the open doors, the man in greasy work clothes who sat near\r\nthe door, night after night, laboriously studying, a technical journal\r\nperhaps, difficult for him, but promising a brighter future. There had\r\nbeen an aged, scholarly gentleman who sat on the other side of the\r\ndoor, leisurely paging, moving his lips a little as he did so, a man\r\nhaving little time left, but rich in time because he could do with it\r\nas he chose.\r\n\r\nHenry had never gone in. He had started up the steps once, got almost\r\nto the door, but then he remembered Agnes, her questions and shouting,\r\nand he had turned away.\r\n\r\nHe was going in now though, almost crawling, his breath coming in\r\nstabbing gasps, his hands torn and bleeding. His trouser leg was\r\nsticky red where the wound in his leg had soaked through the\r\nhandkerchief. It was throbbing badly but Henry didn\'t care. He had\r\nreached his destination.\r\n\r\nPart of the inscription was still there, over the now doorless\r\nentrance. P-U-B--C L-I-B-R---. The rest had been torn away. The place\r\nwas in shambles. The shelves were overturned, broken, smashed, tilted,\r\ntheir precious contents spilled in disorder upon the floor. A lot of\r\nthe books, Henry noted gleefully, were still intact, still whole,\r\nstill readable. He was literally knee deep in them, he wallowed in\r\nbooks. He picked one up. The title was "Collected Works of William\r\nShakespeare." Yes, he must read that, sometime. He laid it aside\r\ncarefully. He picked up another. Spinoza. He tossed it away, seized\r\nanother, and another, and still another. Which to read first ... there\r\nwere so many.\r\n\r\nHe had been conducting himself a little like a starving man in a\r\ndelicatessen--grabbing a little of this and a little of that in a\r\nfrenzy of enjoyment.\r\n\r\nBut now he steadied away. From the pile about him, he selected one\r\nvolume, sat comfortably down on an overturned shelf, and opened the\r\nbook.\r\n\r\nHenry Bemis smiled.\r\n\r\nThere was the rumble of complaining stone. Minute in comparison with\r\nthe epic complaints following the fall of the bomb. This one occurred\r\nunder one corner of the shelf upon which Henry sat. The shelf moved;\r\nthrew him off balance. The glasses slipped from his nose and fell with\r\na tinkle.\r\n\r\nHe bent down, clawing blindly and found, finally, their smashed\r\nremains. A minor, indirect destruction stemming from the sudden,\r\nwholesale smashing of a city. But the only one that greatly interested\r\nHenry Bemis.\r\n\r\nHe stared down at the blurred page before him.\r\n\r\nHe began to cry.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE END\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
