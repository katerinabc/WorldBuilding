M. KORNBLUTH\r\n\r\n [Illustration: Illustrated by ASHMAN]\r\n\r\n\r\n _Doing something for humanity\r\n may be fine--for humanity--but\r\n rough on the individual!_\r\n\r\n\r\nHe had quite a rum-blossom on him for a kid, I thought at first. But\r\nwhen he moved closer to the light by the cash register to ask the\r\nbartender for a match or something, I saw it wasn\'t that. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
Not just the\r\nnose. Broken veins on his cheeks, too, and the funny eyes. He must have\r\nseen me look, because he slid back away from the light.\r\n\r\nThe bartender shook my bottle of ale in front of me like a Swiss\r\nbell-ringer so it foamed inside the green glass.\r\n\r\n"You ready for another, sir?" he asked.\r\n\r\nI shook my head. Down the bar, he tried it on the kid--he was drinking\r\nscotch and water or something like that--and found out he could push him\r\naround. He sold him three scotch and waters in ten minutes.\r\n\r\nWhen he tried for number four, the kid had his courage up and said,\r\n"I\'ll tell _you_ when I\'m ready for another, Jack." But there wasn\'t any\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nIt was almost nine and the place began to fill up. The manager, a real\r\nhood type, stationed himself by the door to screen out the high-school\r\nkids and give the big hello to conventioneers. The girls came hurrying\r\nin, too, with their little makeup cases and their fancy hair piled up\r\nand their frozen faces with the perfect mouths drawn on them. One of\r\nthem stopped to say something to the manager, some excuse about\r\nsomething, and he said: "That\'s aw ri\'; get inna dressing room."\r\n\r\nA three-piece band behind the drapes at the back of the stage began to\r\nmake warm-up noises and there were two bartenders keeping busy. Mostly\r\nit was beer--a midweek crowd. I finished my ale and had to wait a couple\r\nof minutes before I could get another bottle. The bar filled up from the\r\nend near the stage because all the customers wanted a good, close look\r\nat the strippers for their fifty-cent bottles of beer. But I noticed\r\nthat nobody sat down next to the kid, or, if anybody did, he didn\'t stay\r\nlong--you go out for some fun and the bartender pushes you around and\r\nnobody wants to sit next to you. I picked up my bottle and glass and\r\nwent down on the stool to his left.\r\n\r\nHe turned to me right away and said: "What kind of a place is this,\r\nanyway?" The broken veins were all over his face, little ones, but so\r\nmany, so close, that they made his face look something like marbled\r\nrubber. The funny look in his eyes was it--the trick contact lenses. But\r\nI tried not to stare and not to look away.\r\n\r\n"It\'s okay," I said. "It\'s a good show if you don\'t mind a lot of noise\r\nfrom--"\r\n\r\nHe stuck a cigarette into his mouth and poked the pack at me. "I\'m a\r\nspacer," he said, interrupting.\r\n\r\nI took one of his cigarettes and said: "Oh."\r\n\r\nHe snapped a lighter for the cigarettes and said: "Venus."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI was noticing that his pack of cigarettes on the bar had some kind of\r\nyellow sticker instead of the blue tax stamp.\r\n\r\n"Ain\'t that a crock?" he asked. "You can\'t smoke and they give you\r\nlighters for a souvenir. But it\'s a good lighter. On Mars last week,\r\nthey gave us all some cheap pen-and-pencil sets."\r\n\r\n"You get something every trip, hah?" I took a good, long drink of ale\r\nand he finished his scotch and water.\r\n\r\n"Shoot. You call a trip a \'shoot\'."\r\n\r\nOne of the girls was working her way down the bar. She was going to\r\nslide onto the empty stool at his right and give him the business, but\r\nshe looked at him first and decided not to. She curled around me and\r\nasked if I\'d buy her a li\'l ole drink. I said no and she moved on to the\r\nnext. I could kind of feel the young fellow quivering. When I looked at\r\nhim, he stood up. I followed him out of the dump. The manager grinned\r\nwithout thinking and said, "G\'night, boys," to us.\r\n\r\nThe kid stopped in the street and said to me: "You don\'t have to follow\r\nme around, Pappy." He sounded like one wrong word and I would get socked\r\nin the teeth.\r\n\r\n"Take it easy. I know a place where they won\'t spit in your eye."\r\n\r\nHe pulled himself together and made a joke of it. "This I have to see,"\r\nhe said. "Near here?"\r\n\r\n"A few blocks."\r\n\r\nWe started walking. It was a nice night.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know this city at all," he said. "I\'m from Covington, Kentucky.\r\nYou do your drinking at home there. We don\'t have places like this." He\r\nmeant the whole Skid Row area.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not so bad," I said. "I spend a lot of time here."\r\n\r\n"Is that a fact? I mean, down home a man your age would likely have a\r\nwife and children."\r\n\r\n"I do. The hell with them."\r\n\r\nHe laughed like a real youngster and I figured he couldn\'t even be\r\ntwenty-five. He didn\'t have any trouble with the broken curbstones in\r\nspite of his scotch and waters. I asked him about it.\r\n\r\n"Sense of balance," he said. "You have to be tops for balance to be a\r\nspacer--you spend so much time outside in a suit. People don\'t know how\r\nmuch. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Punctures. And you aren\'t worth a damn if you lose your point."\r\n\r\n"What\'s that mean?"\r\n\r\n"Oh. Well, it\'s hard to describe. When you\'re outside and you lose your\r\npoint, it means you\'re all mixed up, you don\'t know which way the\r\ncan--that\'s the ship--which way the can is. It\'s having all that room\r\naround you. But if you have a good balance, you feel a little tugging to\r\nthe ship, or maybe you just _know_ which way the ship is without feeling\r\nit. Then you have your point and you can get the work done.

=== Chunk 4 ===
"\r\n\r\n"There must be a lot that\'s hard to describe."\r\n\r\nHe thought that might be a crack and he clammed up on me.\r\n\r\n"You call this Gandytown," I said after a while. "It\'s where the\r\nstove-up old railroad men hang out. This is the place."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was the second week of the month, before everybody\'s pension check\r\nwas all gone. Oswiak\'s was jumping. The Grandsons of the Pioneers were\r\non the juke singing the _Man from Mars Yodel_ and old Paddy Shea was\r\njigging in the middle of the floor. He had a full seidel of beer in his\r\nright hand and his empty left sleeve was flapping.\r\n\r\nThe kid balked at the screen door. "Too damn bright," he said.\r\n\r\nI shrugged and went on in and he followed. We sat down at a table. At\r\nOswiak\'s you can drink at the bar if you want to, but none of the\r\nregulars do.\r\n\r\nPaddy jigged over and said: "Welcome home, Doc." He\'s a Liverpool\r\nIrishman; they talk like Scots, some say, but they sound almost like\r\nBrooklyn to me.\r\n\r\n"Hello, Paddy. I brought somebody uglier than you. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Now what do you say?"\r\n\r\nPaddy jigged around the kid in a half-circle with his sleeve flapping\r\nand then flopped into a chair when the record stopped. He took a big\r\ndrink from the seidel and said: "Can he do this?" Paddy stretched his\r\nface into an awful grin that showed his teeth. He has three of them. The\r\nkid laughed and asked me: "What the hell did you drag me into here for?"\r\n\r\n"Paddy says he\'ll buy drinks for the house the day anybody uglier than\r\nhe is comes in."\r\n\r\nOswiak\'s wife waddled over for the order and the kid asked us what we\'d\r\nhave. I figured I could start drinking, so it was three double scotches.\r\n\r\nAfter the second round, Paddy started blowing about how they took his\r\narm off without any anesthetics except a bottle of gin because the\r\nred-ball freight he was tangled up in couldn\'t wait.\r\n\r\nThat brought some of the other old gimps over to the table with their\r\nstories.\r\n\r\nBlackie Bauer had been sitting in a boxcar with his legs sticking\r\nthrough the door when the train started with a jerk. Wham, the door\r\nclosed. Everybody laughed at Blackie for being that dumb in the first\r\nplace, and he got mad.\r\n\r\nSam Fireman has palsy. This week he was claiming he used to be a\r\nwatchmaker before he began to shake. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
The week before, he\'d said he was a\r\nbrain surgeon. A woman I didn\'t know, a real old Boxcar Bertha, dragged\r\nherself over and began some kind of story about how her sister married a\r\nGreek, but she passed out before we found out what happened.\r\n\r\nSomebody wanted to know what was wrong with the kid\'s face--Bauer, I\r\nthink it was, after he came back to the table.\r\n\r\n"Compression and decompression," the kid said. "You\'re all the time\r\nclimbing into your suit and out of your suit. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Inboard air\'s thin to\r\nstart with. You get a few redlines--that\'s these ruptured blood\r\nvessels--and you say the hell with the money; all you\'ll make is just\r\none more trip. But, God, it\'s a lot of money for anybody my age! You\r\nkeep saying that until you can\'t be anything but a spacer. The eyes are\r\nhard-radiation scars."\r\n\r\n"You like dot all ofer?" asked Oswiak\'s wife politely.\r\n\r\n"All over, ma\'am," the kid told her in a miserable voice. "But I\'m going\r\nto quit before I get a Bowman Head."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care," said Maggie Rorty. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
"I think he\'s cute."\r\n\r\n"Compared with--" Paddy began, but I kicked him under the table.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe sang for a while, and then we told gags and recited limericks for a\r\nwhile, and I noticed that the kid and Maggie had wandered into the back\r\nroom--the one with the latch on the door.\r\n\r\nOswiak\'s wife asked me, very puzzled: "Doc, w\'y dey do dot flyink by\r\nplanyets?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s the damn govermint," Sam Fireman said.\r\n\r\n"Why not?" 

=== Chunk 9 ===
I said. "They got the Bowman Drive, why the hell shouldn\'t\r\nthey use it? Serves \'em right." I had a double scotch and added: "Twenty\r\nyears of it and they found out a few things they didn\'t know. Redlines\r\nare only one of them. Twenty years more, maybe they\'ll find out a few\r\nmore things they didn\'t know. Maybe by the time there\'s a bathtub in\r\nevery American home and an alcoholism clinic in every American town,\r\nthey\'ll find out a whole _lot_ of things they didn\'t know. And every\r\nAmerican boy will be a pop-eyed, blood-raddled wreck, like our friend\r\nhere, from riding the Bowman Drive."\r\n\r\n"It\'s the damn govermint," Sam Fireman repeated.\r\n\r\n"And what the hell did you mean by that remark about alcoholism?" Paddy\r\nsaid, real sore. "Personally, I can take it or leave it alone."\r\n\r\nSo we got to talking about that and everybody there turned out to be\r\npeople who could take it or leave it alone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was maybe midnight when the kid showed at the table again, looking\r\nkind of dazed. I was drunker than I ought to be by midnight, so I said I\r\nwas going for a walk. He tagged along and we wound up on a bench at\r\nScrewball Square. The soap-boxers were still going strong. Like I said,\r\nit was a nice night. After a while, a pot-bellied old auntie who didn\'t\r\ngive a damn about the face sat down and tried to talk the kid into going\r\nto see some etchings. The kid didn\'t get it and I led him over to hear\r\nthe soap-boxers before there was trouble.\r\n\r\nOne of the orators was a mush-mouthed evangelist. "And, oh, my friends,"\r\nhe said, "when I looked through the porthole of the spaceship and beheld\r\nthe wonder of the Firmament--"\r\n\r\n"You\'re a stinkin\' Yankee liar!" the kid yelled at him. "You say one\r\ndamn more word about can-shootin\' and I\'ll ram your spaceship down your\r\nlyin\' throat! Wheah\'s your redlines if you\'re such a hot spacer?"\r\n\r\nThe crowd didn\'t know what he was talking about, but "wheah\'s your\r\nredlines" sounded good to them, so they heckled mush-mouth off his box\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nI got the kid to a bench. The liquor was working in him all of a sudden.\r\nHe simmered down after a while and asked: "Doc, should I\'ve given Miz\r\nRorty some money? I asked her afterward and she said she\'d admire to\r\nhave something to remember me by, so I gave her my lighter. She seem\' to\r\nbe real pleased with it. But I was wondering if maybe I embarrassed her\r\nby asking her right out. Like I tol\' you, back in Covington, Kentucky,\r\nwe don\'t have places like that. Or maybe we did and I just didn\'t know\r\nabout them. But what do you think I should\'ve done about Miz Rorty?"\r\n\r\n"Just what you did," I told him. "If they want money, they ask you for\r\nit first. Where you staying?"\r\n\r\n"Y.M.C.A.," he said, almost asleep. "Back in Covington, Kentucky, I was\r\na member of the Y and I kept up my membership. They have to let me in\r\nbecause I\'m a member. Spacers have all kinds of trouble, Doc. Woman\r\ntrouble. Hotel trouble. Fam\'ly trouble. Religious trouble. I was raised\r\na Southern Baptist, but wheah\'s Heaven, anyway? I ask\' Doctor Chitwood\r\nlas\' time home before the redlines got so thick--Doc, you aren\'t a\r\nminister of the Gospel, are you? I hope I di\'n\' say anything to offend\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"No offense, son," I said. "No offense."\r\n\r\nI walked him to the avenue and waited for a fleet cab. It was almost\r\nfive minutes. The independents that roll drunks dent the fenders of\r\nfleet cabs if they show up in Skid Row and then the fleet drivers have\r\nto make reports on their own time to the company. It keeps them away.\r\nBut I got one and dumped the kid in.\r\n\r\n"The Y Hotel," I told the driver. "Here\'s five. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
Help him in when you get\r\nthere."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen I walked through Screwball Square again, some college kids were\r\nyelling "wheah\'s your redlines" at old Charlie, the last of the\r\nWobblies.\r\n\r\nOld Charlie kept roaring: "The hell with your breadlines! I\'m talking\r\nabout atomic bombs. _Right--up--there!_" And he pointed at the Moon.\r\n\r\nIt was a nice night, but the liquor was dying in me.\r\n\r\nThere was a joint around the corner, so I went in and had a drink to\r\ncarry me to the club; I had a bottle there. I got into the first cab\r\nthat came.\r\n\r\n"Athletic Club," I said.\r\n\r\n"Inna dawghouse, harh?" the driver said, and he gave me a big\r\npersonality smile.\r\n\r\nI didn\'t say anything and he started the car.\r\n\r\nHe was right, of course. I was in everybody\'s doghouse. Some day I\'d\r\nscare hell out of Tom and Lise by going home and showing them what their\r\ndaddy looked like.\r\n\r\nDown at the Institute, I was in the doghouse.\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear," everybody at the Institute said to everybody, "I\'m sure I\r\ndon\'t know what ails the man. A lovely wife and two lovely grown\r\nchildren and she had to tell him \'either you go or I go.\' And\r\n_drinking_! And this is rather subtle, but it\'s a well-known fact that\r\nneurotics seek out low company to compensate for their guilt-feelings.\r\nThe _places_ he frequents. Doctor Francis Bowman, the man who made\r\nspace-flight a reality. The man who put the Bomb Base on the Moon!\r\nReally, I\'m sure I don\'t know what ails him."\r\n\r\nThe hell with them all.\r\n\r\n                                                     --C. M.
