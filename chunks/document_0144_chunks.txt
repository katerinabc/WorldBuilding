]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             As pretty as a picture? Yes, because that was\r\n               all she was ... or would become some day!\r\n\r\n\r\nMy brother, Perry, always was a bit cracked. As a kid, he almost blew\r\nup our house doing experiments. When he was eighteen, he wrote poetry,\r\nbut fortunately that didn\'t last long and he went back to science.\r\n\r\nNow, when he showed me this picture, I figured he\'d had a relapse of\r\nsome kind. "This is the girl I\'m in love with," he said.\r\n\r\nShe wasn\'t bad. Not bad at all, even if her clothes were crazy. She\r\nwasn\'t my type--too brainy-looking--although I could see how some guys\r\nwould go for her. "I thought you liked blondes."\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t give you two cents for all the blondes in Hollywood," he\r\nanswered. "This is the only girl for me."\r\n\r\n"You sound as if you\'ve got it bad," I said. "You going to marry her?"\r\n\r\nHis face dropped about a mile. "I can\'t."\r\n\r\n"You mean she\'s married already?" I was surprised. This wasn\'t like\r\nPerry at all.\r\n\r\nHe sort of hesitated, as if he was afraid of saying too much. "No,\r\nshe isn\'t married. I asked her about that. But I can\'t marry her\r\nbecause--well, I\'ve never met her. All I\'ve seen of her is this\r\npicture and a few more. She doesn\'t live here."\r\n\r\n"You mean she\'s in Europe?" I\'ve heard of these love affairs by mail,\r\nand they never made much sense to me. I said to Perry, "Why can\'t she\r\ncome to this country?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, there are a lot of things in the way."\r\n\r\nIt sounded worse and worse. I said, "Look, Perry, this smells like a\r\nracket to me. It\'s the kind of thing a couple of shrewd operators cook\r\nup to take some hick for a ride. I\'m surprised at you falling for it.\r\nHow do you know there really is a dame like that in Europe? Anybody can\r\nsend pictures----"\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got it all wrong," he said. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
"I\'ve spoken to her."\r\n\r\n"By phone? How do you know who\'s on the other end? You hear a dame\'s\r\nvoice you never heard before. What makes you think it\'s hers?"\r\n\r\nAgain he didn\'t seem to want to talk, as if he had some secret to hide.\r\nBut I guess he felt like getting things off his chest, too, or he\r\nwouldn\'t have opened up in the first place. And he had already told me\r\nenough so that if he didn\'t tell me more he\'d sound like a dope.\r\n\r\nSo after hesitating even longer than before, he said, "Let\'s get this\r\nstraight, George. This is no racket. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
I\'ve seen and talked to her at\r\nthe same time. And the things she talked about, no con man would know."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve seen and talked to her at the same time? You mean by TV? 

=== Chunk 5 ===
I\r\ndon\'t believe it. They can\'t send TV to Europe."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t say it was TV. And I didn\'t say she lived in Europe."\r\n\r\n"That\'s exactly what you did say. Or maybe you meant she lived on Mars?"\r\n\r\n"No. She\'s an American."\r\n\r\n"This makes less and less sense to me. Where did you meet her?"\r\n\r\nHe turned red, and squirmed all over the place. Finally he said, "Right\r\nhere in my own laboratory."\r\n\r\n"In your own laboratory! But you said you never met her in the flesh!"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t. Not really by TV either. The fact is--she isn\'t born yet."\r\n\r\nI backed away from him. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
When he was a kid and blew up our kitchen, I\r\ndidn\'t like it. When he wrote poetry, I was kind of ashamed and didn\'t\r\nwant my pals to know he was my brother. Now, I was really scared.\r\nEverything he had been saying in the last ten minutes began to make\r\nsense, but a screwy kind of sense.\r\n\r\nHe saw how I felt. "Don\'t worry, George, I haven\'t gone crazy. Her time\r\nis 2973, more than a thousand years from now. The only way I\'ve seen\r\nand talked to her is on a time-contact machine."\r\n\r\n"Come again?"\r\n\r\n"A kind of time machine. It can\'t send material objects back and\r\nforth across time, as far as I know, but it can send certain waves,\r\nespecially the kind we use to transmit signals. That\'s how she and I\r\ncould talk to each other and see each other."\r\n\r\n"Perry, I think you ought to see a good doctor."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a remarkable device," he said, paying no attention to how I\r\nwas trying to help him. "She\'s the one who first constructed it and\r\ncontacted me. It\'s based on an extension of Einstein\'s equations----"\r\n\r\n"You think you can explain so much," I said. "Okay, then, explain this.\r\nThis dame isn\'t going to be born for a thousand years. And yet you\r\ntell me you\'re in love with her. What\'s the difference between you and\r\nsomebody that\'s nuts?" I asked, as if anybody knew the answer.\r\n\r\nHe certainly didn\'t. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
In fact, he went ahead and proved to me that they\r\nwere the same thing. Because for the next couple of weeks, the only\r\nthing he\'d talk about, outside of equations I couldn\'t understand,\r\nwas this dame. How smart she was, and how beautiful she was, and how\r\nwonderful she was in every way that a dame can be wonderful, and how\r\nshe loved him. For a time he had me convinced that she actually existed.\r\n\r\n"Compared with you," I said, "Romeo had a mild case."\r\n\r\n"There are some quantities so great that you can\'t measure them," he\r\nsaid. "That will give you some idea of our love for each other."\r\n\r\nThere it went, the old poetry, cropping out in him just like before.\r\nAnd all the time I\'d been thinking it was like measles, something that\r\nyou get once and it builds up your resistance so you don\'t get it\r\nagain, at least not bad. It just goes to show how wrong I could be.\r\n\r\n"What preacher are you going to get to marry you?" I asked. "A guy born\r\nfive hundred years from now?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think that\'s funny," he said.\r\n\r\n"You\'re telling me. Look, Perry, you\'re smart enough to know what I\'m\r\nthinking----"\r\n\r\n"You still think I\'m crazy."\r\n\r\n"I got an open mind on the subject. Now, if you won\'t see a\r\ndoctor--then how about letting me take a look at this dame, so I can\r\nconvince myself?"\r\n\r\n"No," he said. "I\'ve considered doing that, and decided against it.\r\nHer voice and image come through for only about five minutes a day,\r\nsometimes less. And those minutes are very precious to us. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
We don\'t\r\nwant any one else present, any one at all."\r\n\r\n"Not even to convince me she actually exists?"\r\n\r\n"You wouldn\'t be convinced anyway," he said very shrewdly. "No matter\r\nwhat I showed you, you\'d still find a reason to call it a fraud."\r\n\r\nHe was right at that. It would take a lot of convincing to make me\r\nbelieve that a babe who wasn\'t going to get born for a thousand years\r\nwas in love with him.\r\n\r\nBy this time, though, I was sure of one thing--there was something\r\nscrewy going on in that laboratory of his. For five minutes a day he\r\nwas watching some dame\'s picture, listening to her voice. If I had an\r\nidea what she was like, I might figure out where to go from there.\r\n\r\nI began keeping an eye on Perry, dropping in at the laboratory to pay\r\nhim visits. There was what looked like a ten-inch TV tube in one corner\r\nof his place, not housed in a cabinet, but lying on the table among\r\ndozens of other tubes and rheostats and meters and other things I\r\ndidn\'t know about. Along the wall that led from this corner was a lot\r\nof stuff which Perry said was high voltage, and warned me not to touch.\r\n\r\nI kept away. I wasn\'t trying to figure out how to get myself killed.\r\nAll I wanted to know was when he saw this girl.\r\n\r\nFinally I managed to pin the time down to between three and four in the\r\nafternoon. For five minutes every day, during that hour, he locked the\r\ndoor and didn\'t answer phone calls. I figured that if I dropped in then\r\nI might get a glimpse of her.\r\n\r\nAnd that\'s what I did.\r\n\r\nAt first, when I knocked on the door, there was no answer. In a minute,\r\nthough, I heard Perry\'s voice, but he wasn\'t talking to me. He was\r\nsaying, "Darling," and he sounded kind of sick, which I figured was\r\ndue to love. Come to think of it, he might have been scared a little.\r\nI heard him say, "Don\'t be afraid," and it was quiet for about fifteen\r\nseconds.\r\n\r\nThen I heard a terrific crash, like lightning striking. The door shook,\r\nand I smelled something sharp, and the first thing I wanted to do was\r\nget out of that place. But I couldn\'t leave my brother in there.\r\n\r\nI put my shoulder to the door and had no trouble at all. The explosion,\r\nor whatever it was, must have weakened the hinges. As the door crashed\r\nin, I looked for Perry.\r\n\r\nThere was no sign of him. But I could see his shoes, on the floor in\r\nfront of that TV tube, where he must have been standing. No feet in\r\nthem, though, just his socks. All the high-voltage stuff was smoking.\r\nThe TV screen was all lit up, and on it I could see a girl\'s face, the\r\nsame girl whose picture Perry had shown me. She was wearing one of\r\nthose funny costumes, and she looked scared. It was a clear picture,\r\nand I could even see the way she gulped.\r\n\r\nThen she broke out into a happy smile and, for about half a second,\r\nbefore the second explosion, I could see Perry on the screen. After\r\nthat second explosion--even though it wasn\'t near as big as the\r\nfirst--that TV set was nothing but a mess of twisted junk, and there\r\nwas no screen left to see anything on.\r\n\r\nPerry liked to have everything just so, and he\'d never think of going\r\nanyplace without his tie being knotted just right, and his socks\r\nmatching, and so on. And here he\'d traveled a thousand years into the\r\nfuture in bare feet. I felt kind of embarrassed for him.\r\n\r\nAnyway, they were engaged, and now they must be married, so I guess she\r\nhad slippers waiting for him. I\'m just sorry I missed the wedding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
