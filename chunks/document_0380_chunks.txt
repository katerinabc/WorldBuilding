B. LEWIS\r\n\r\n            In the dim Water Temple, where the dead grinned\r\n            down on the dead, Hale met his D-day. Should he\r\n             give an ex-comrade to the torturing Lhrai or\r\n             chance the massacre of Terrestrial thousands?\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n                    Planet Stories September 1951.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHale cut the motor as he swerved off the ancient plastic roadway.\r\nHis one-man beetle thumped over the shoulder and, wheels whispering,\r\ncoasted down the sandy, moonlit slope. It threaded between mighty\r\n_linla_ cacti that had the size and shape of spaceships towering grey\r\nin the night. He braked it to a slanting stop and got out, a big,\r\nlong-legged man who carefully kept the little car between himself and\r\nthe Martian water temple that sat a short distance away where the dunes\r\nof the desert began. He thought, Strange to be afraid of getting shot\r\nby Randy.\r\n\r\nWeiss said, from the shadows, "Better get out of the moonlight, Hale.\r\nThat beetle won\'t stop a blaster bolt."\r\n\r\nHale crossed to the clot of men that made dark blurs under the _linla_.\r\nWeiss said, "What took you so long?"\r\n\r\nHale said, "I had to get my gun recharged. Sturm was working on it when\r\nSam came busting in the shop and told me you\'d cornered Randy." He\r\ntouched the blaster at his belt, then brought up the hand to get out\r\na cigarette from his jacket pocket. He struck a match on the blaster\r\nbutt. "Why call me? Why not call the Patrol?"\r\n\r\nSomeone stirred in the darkness, clearing a throat. "Patrol never hung\r\na looter yet and as long as Boss Ricco kicks back to Patrol brass, they\r\nnever will. This one, we\'ll take care of personally. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
The redboys want\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOver the cupped match flame, Hale sent a hard glance in the direction\r\nof the voice. "Eight, ten men aren\'t enough."\r\n\r\nWeiss said placatingly, "We were tipped that he\'d try this temple.\r\nWe were waiting for him, but he got past us. First thing we knew, he\r\nkilled the guardian inside. We heard the shot. We called on him to\r\nsurrender, but hell, he knows what the redboys will do to him if we get\r\nhim alive."\r\n\r\nHale said again, "Why call me?"\r\n\r\n"You know these old water temples. One narrow entrance, no windows.\r\nHe can\'t get out, that\'s for sure, but we can\'t get at him without\r\nlosing a lot of men." Weiss put a hand on Hale\'s arm, and Hale moved\r\nimpatiently and Weiss took it away, saying, "You know Randy better\'n\r\nany of us."\r\n\r\n"We came to Mars together," said Hale. "We worked our way out on the\r\nsame crate. We started our farm, but Randy didn\'t stick. He said\r\nthere was always easy money on a frontier, and Mars shouldn\'t be any\r\ndifferent. Said he preferred four ladies to a hoe."\r\n\r\n"He should\'ve stuck to cards," said the man who had cleared his throat.\r\n\r\nGeorge Weiss said, firmly, "We want you to go in and talk to him. You\r\nwere his best friend. He\'ll listen to you. Tell him it\'s no use."\r\n\r\nHale said, "That\'s what I figured." He turned to look at the temple,\r\nsquat and white in the gloom. The doorway was tall and thin and dead\r\nblack, and behind it, part of the blackness, was Randy and his gun. And\r\nhe\'d be desperate. As Hale turned back he caught a faint, acrid odor,\r\nand he knew that a Martian was nearby, crouching, waiting to see that\r\nthis was done right.\r\n\r\n"There\'ve been a hundred temples stripped of their twin-stones in the\r\npast year," Weiss said. "Our redboys are getting fed up with it. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
The\r\nC. A.\'s too busy whipping the climate to tend to looters, and the\r\nPatrol buys its liquor and mammas with loot money. Half the law is too\r\ndamned busy, and the other half\'s crooked--and we\'re in the middle. The\r\nredboys have run out of patience."\r\n\r\nHale nodded. "My own redboys are ready to go on the warpath. Okay. So\r\nRandy\'s the goat elect. So relax and starve him out."\r\n\r\n"They want him tonight. We promised--"\r\n\r\n"All right, go keep it. Hell, I didn\'t promise anything. Damned if I\'ll\r\nrisk my neck to--"\r\n\r\n"--promised to deliver," Weiss went on flatly, "because we had to.\r\nWe\'re in a nut-cracker, Hale. The _Lhrai_ priests are set to trigger\r\nanother Green Spot unless they get Randy to play with. Deadline\'s dawn."\r\n\r\nHale remembered Green Spot. It was a bloody, terrible memory. Green\r\nSpot had been one of the earliest and largest farm-settlements on Mars.\r\nOne night, for some other-worldly reason that the Colonial Authority\r\nwas still puzzling about, the Martian workers had slit two hundred\r\nTerrestrial throats and vanished into the red desert. The _Lhrai_\r\npriests had conveyed regrets, assuring the Authority at the same\r\ntime that there had been adequate provocation for the act. And the\r\nAuthority, horrified for its sixty thousand colonists, had admitted\r\nthat there must have been.\r\n\r\nHale thought back, in conflicting terms of personal friendship and unit\r\nsurvival. These men in the shadows; most of them were his friends. He\r\nhad worked with them, leaning on hoes in the fields or sitting in the\r\nenclosed warmth of a back porch discussing the perversities of Martian\r\ngeochemistry. He had helled around Firstport with them, had often led\r\nthem in the helling. His wife was the friend of their wives. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
While\r\nRandy--\r\n\r\nRandy was five years ago. Randy was thirty acres of crops dumped in\r\nHale\'s lap when they\'d needed working. Randy was a bitter girl named\r\nSusan who waited on tables in New Chicago halfway across Mars, and the\r\nson he never cared that he\'d given her before he went away.\r\n\r\n"Wait here," said Hale in a sour voice, and tossed away his cigarette.\r\n"I\'ll see what I can do."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe temple was hexagonal, featureless save for the black slit of the\r\ndoorway, smooth native marble gleaming under Phobos\' dim silver.\r\n\r\nHe stopped a few feet away and called, "Randy, it\'s me. Hale. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Don\'t\r\nshoot. I\'m coming in to talk to you."\r\n\r\nRandy\'s voice, soft and oddly echoed by the temple walls, floated from\r\nthe black slit. "Come on in, Hale. I won a bet with myself, that they\'d\r\nholler for you."\r\n\r\nHale walked on, slowly, one hand brushing his blaster butt at each\r\nstep. Again the sensation of strangeness, of wrongness, that he should\r\nbe afraid of being shot by Randy. Five years ago Randy had been a lean,\r\nfox-eyed kid, inclined to be touchy, but no hard-case. But after five\r\nyears in the excrescent canal-towns, the smoke-filled dives where a\r\ncoin on the bar bought a drink or a drug and, more covertly tendered,\r\na life--five years in a sour pool, floating with the scums that even\r\nfresh water collects when it settles--and now, a looting and a killing--\r\n\r\nHale felt cold, and he was perspiring. The blaster was a solid weight\r\non his thigh.\r\n\r\nHe reached the doorway and stood uncertainly, knowing the men behind\r\nhim were watching him. Wondering if he\'ll kill me, he thought. Maybe\r\nhe\'s turned into a ring-tailed killer. Kid, kid, why did you have to do\r\nit? Why didn\'t you get off Mars, like I told you to?\r\n\r\nThe hollow, echoed voice said, "Come on in. I wouldn\'t shoot you,\r\nHale." But the voice had a thin sound to it, and Hale thought, He\r\nmight.\r\n\r\nThe doorway was about two feet across, in a wall six feet thick. Smooth\r\nmarble rustled the leather at Hale\'s shoulders as he entered the thick\r\nblackness. Three paces, echoing, and his fingertips told him he had\r\nreached the interior. He felt with his feet, located the top of the\r\nshallow steps that every such temple contained--five steps down into a\r\ntrench which had once held precious water, then three steps up to the\r\ntemple floor. His bootheels rang sharply--five, two across the trench,\r\nthree--then he stood in darkness, waiting.\r\n\r\nRandy said, "You\'ve gained some weight, Hale. Or is it the jacket?

=== Chunk 6 ===
"\r\nSort of amused, but with that same thin sound.\r\n\r\nHale said, "Both." He took a forward step, at an angle, and saw the\r\nfaint flood of moonlight appear on the temple floor and knew that Randy\r\ncould no longer see him. He said, "Weiss said to tell you it\'s no use."\r\n\r\n"George\'s out there, eh? Thought I recognized his voice. I wonder who\r\ntipped them off. I\'ve made some enemies along the canals, I suppose."\r\n\r\nStartlingly, a match flamed in the blackness, became an orange glow\r\nthat rose to the cigarette between Randy\'s lips. He was over near a\r\nwall, his gun in his other hand. He puffed hard and his face glowed\r\nmasklike, his eyes seeking Hale.\r\n\r\nHale, blinking, saw that Randy hadn\'t changed much. He was still dark\r\nand slender, his brown eyes large and bright. But now his hair came\r\ndown fully to the fur collar of his jacket, in the manner of the canal\r\ncrowd. The movement that brought him to Hale\'s side was graceful.\r\n\r\n"How many are they, Hale? Think I could break for it?"\r\n\r\nHale said, "It\'d be quicker than the redboys."\r\n\r\nRandy pulled in a hard breath. "My blaster\'s jammed. They could\'ve\r\nnailed me any time they felt like it. It\'s been hell, waiting for\r\nthat." He looked at the gun. The hand that held it was trembling.\r\n\r\nHale sighed. "I guess I could walk you out at gunpoint, then, but I\r\ndon\'t want to do that. Come out with me on your own hook, Randy. You\'ve\r\nplayed your four queens till now, but you drew a bad hand tonight."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRandy drew unsteadily on his cigarette. Hale, looking beyond, saw the\r\ndark mass near one wall that must be the guardian. The stain on the\r\nfur robe was black. The blind sockets in the skull of the _Lhrai_, who\r\nsprawled batlike against the chanting wall, were black too.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t want to shoot the redboy." Randy slowly holstered the gun.\r\n"I slugged him, but he had a hard head. He came at me with a knife\r\nwhile I was prying the twin-stones out of the idol. Why couldn\'t he lay\r\nquiet? I never wanted to kill anybody." His eyes found Hale\'s in the\r\ngloom, and the brightness in them tonight was mostly fear. "You always\r\nsaid I ought to get off Mars. Last week, I decided to. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
But I didn\'t\r\nhave any money, so I went to Ricco. He wouldn\'t trust me off-world\r\nwith his money, but he said he had a tourist interested in a good set\r\nof twin-stones. He said there was five thousand in it for me. He said\r\nthere was a good pair here, and--"\r\n\r\nHe stopped short, his young face hardening with shocking suddenness.\r\n"By the red gods, _Ricco_!" he ground out. "Of course--he tipped them\r\noff I\'d be here. So he\'d have me killed over a girl, damn his black\r\nsoul." He spun away from Hale in a violent motion, his thin mouth feral\r\nwith rage. Hale waited in the blackness and slowly Randy turned back.\r\nCarefully he flattened the cigarette his clenching fist had bruised.\r\n"Why didn\'t I think?" he almost whispered. "They told me he was after\r\nmy skin--"\r\n\r\nHale started to say something, but Randy\'s hands were suddenly tight\r\non Hale\'s arms, and his breath carried the taint of _inque_ liquor to\r\nHale\'s nostrils. "Hale, you\'ve got to help me. I want to get off Mars.\r\nThat was why I did it. It was my first mark. Oh, I\'ve drifted the\r\ncanals and chilled some decks, but this was my first mark--"\r\n\r\nHale said, "I came in to try to help, Randy. If you\'ll walk out with\r\nme, it\'ll be easier all around.

=== Chunk 8 ===
"\r\n\r\nRandy shook his head fiercely. "Lord, you don\'t want them to turn me\r\nover to the redboys, do you? The _Lhrai_ priests can peel a man and\r\nkeep him alive for days--"\r\n\r\nUncomfortably, Hale said, "I couldn\'t help you if I wanted to. They\'re\r\nwaiting outside.

=== Chunk 9 ===
"\r\n\r\nRandy took breath through his teeth. "Just stay here. Let me walk out.\r\nThey won\'t blast, thinking it\'s you. Is your beetle anywhere near the\r\ntemple?"\r\n\r\n"They\'re practically sitting on it."\r\n\r\n"Then I can break for the desert. It\'s a good chance in the dark. I can\r\ncut up along Coprates to Freightport and--"\r\n\r\nHal said, "No, Randy."\r\n\r\nRandy laughed softly, and the laugh had all the old familiar\r\nrecklessness in it, but it couldn\'t hide the fear. "You will, Hale. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
I\r\ngot into this mess trying to do what you always told me to--get a new\r\nstart on some other clod. There are plenty of jobs on Venus. Maybe I\r\ncan still stowaway to Venus. I swear that\'s where I\'ll go, if you\'ll\r\nonly let me through that door."\r\n\r\n"Venus has a skid-row, too."\r\n\r\n"I\'m through with it. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
So help me!"\r\n\r\n"You killed that redboy."\r\n\r\n"He tried to kill me. He knew I had a gun. What was I supposed to do?\r\nOnly a redboy--"\r\n\r\nHale said slowly, "What about George and the others? I\'ll have to face\r\nthem on this."\r\n\r\n"They\'ll find you on the floor with a lump on your head. They\'ll never\r\nhold it against you." Randy spread his hands. "I\'d rather you\'d kill\r\nme--now--than take me out there for the redboys."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHale felt baffled. It had been like this in the old days, Randy had\r\nalways had his way. Coming to Mars in the first place had been Randy\'s\r\nidea, and he\'d pressed it, and Hale had done well on Mars. Maybe Randy\r\nhad a break coming. Hale thought, five years isn\'t such a long time,\r\nafter all. He said tiredly, "All right. You can have your chance. 

=== Chunk 12 ===
Good\r\nluck. And I\'ll take those twin-stones, Randy."\r\n\r\nRandy let out a long sigh and looked up at the roof of the temple, as\r\nif he could see far-off Venus in that thick blackness. He brought the\r\nglowing stones from a pocket. "Here\'s Phobos--here\'s Deimos," he said\r\nwryly. "I thought maybe you\'d forget."\r\n\r\nThey were heavy in Hale\'s hand. He said, "So long."\r\n\r\nRandy said, "One more thing, friend," and there was an undefinable\r\nsomething in his voice. "I\'ll need a gun. You\'ll lend me yours, won\'t\r\nyou? They\'ll think I took it." He reached over and slid Hale\'s blaster\r\nfrom his holster, and brought the glowing coal of his cigarette close\r\nto the dial on the butt. "Fully charged. Well, I may need every shot--"\r\nhis eyes met Hale\'s, and that undefinable something was in them\r\ntoo--"for those meddling bastards outside. I owe them for tonight.\r\nNow--" He took a step toward Hale, hefting the gun and raising it to\r\nstrike.\r\n\r\nWithout thought, with only a sick feeling all over, Hale stepped back.\r\nThe twin-stones clicked on the floor at his feet. "Wait, Randy. You\r\nshould\'ve slugged me first ... I don\'t think I want to let you go after\r\nall."\r\n\r\nRandy\'s grin was frozen, and Hale now had a name for that something, a\r\nkind of shame. "I know," Randy said, "I was waiting for that," and he\r\nbrought the gun down in a calculated arc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _"I know," Randy said, "I was waiting for that," and he\r\nbrought the gun down in a calculated arc._]\r\n\r\nHale tried to duck, but Randy had the edge. The gun-barrel slammed into\r\nhis temple. Agonized, he threw up an arm. It chopped against Randy\'s\r\nwrist, and fire and thunder erupted in the blackness. The gun clattered\r\non stone and from somewhere came Randy\'s furious cursing, "Damn you,\r\nHale, you did that! Now I\'ll never--" Then Hale was alone in the temple\r\nwith his pain.\r\n\r\nHe heard the click of bootheels as Randy leaped over the trench, the\r\nhollow thudding down the corridor doorway--then the shouts and the\r\nroar of blasters and the intolerable glare, a stark wavering white\r\nrectangle that washed across the floor from the doorway to flicker upon\r\nthe stony wings and beast-face of _Lhrai_--and the spasmic scream of a\r\nman dissolved in flame.\r\n\r\nHe got to his feet and leaned wearily against the wall, face gaunted by\r\npain, wondering if Randy had known only at the last how ruthless he had\r\nbecome. Life was cheap enough out here on a red world where red insects\r\nbred in your eyes and red beasts swallowed you and let their juices\r\ndo the killing, and it took a good man to fight the alien fight. But\r\nwhen the wrong kind of man came along, it was a knife in the back and\r\nlife had no price at all. That kind of man had to be reckoned on, Hale\r\nthought bleakly--the bad penny that wouldn\'t even go away, hard and\r\nshiny and newly made, like Randy--for values slipped in the rat-race\r\nthat was any frontier, and the urge to prey, for profit, for power, lay\r\nclose under a man\'s skin. Hale sighed. He had hoped for a while--but\r\nno; Randy\'s stamp had been the bloody stamp of the canals, and that\r\nstamp would sooner or later have cancelled out other lives, on Venus or\r\nwherever he took it.\r\n\r\nBetter now, Hale thought, than hunted down the years....\r\n\r\nGeorge Weiss said, from close by in the darkness, "We got him, Hale.\r\nAre you bad hurt?"\r\n\r\nHale pressed his temple, and said, "I\'ll get over it," and meant the\r\npain in his head. Time would have to work to erase the deeper ache.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
