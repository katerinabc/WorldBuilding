The\r\n    schoolmaster\'s last words were: Vive la France! Miss Hippiness, in\r\n    this story, had no final words. But if she had, they might have\r\n    been_:\r\n\r\n                    "_Long live the 20th Century!_"\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n                      Amazing Stories July 1962.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n"And now, children," said Miss Hippiness, her smile shooting deep\r\nwrinkles across her face like the cracks up the scarred sides of the\r\nancient, empty sky-scrapers of New York.\r\n\r\nThe twelve children in the cozy classroom came to attention. It was not\r\nher words, it was the tone, the creaking smile.\r\n\r\n"And now, children," said Miss Hippiness again, sitting down on the\r\nold-fashioned straight chair she affected, "have you all put away your\r\natomic blocks?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, teacher," came the chorus of sweet young voices.\r\n\r\n"Your electronic jackstraws? Your pencil-mnestics?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, teacher."\r\n\r\n"And have you all put the pretty little activator pills in your mouths?"\r\n\r\nThey nodded. Miss Hippiness raised her hand for silence.\r\n\r\n"Thirty dear, dear seconds, children," she said.\r\n\r\nA sigh of pleasure suddenly smoked up from the twelve young faces as\r\nthe pills took effect, and they remembered. Poor little darlings, to be\r\nso terribly fooled, said Miss Hippiness to herself.\r\n\r\nIf it was only possible for them to remember THIS part of the\r\nday, outside--and not to have it blacked out by the pills half an hour\r\nfrom now. To remember this part of the day, above all other parts, on\r\ninto adulthood. What a different world they would create....\r\n\r\n"So we come to the nice nice part of our day," she said. "We are going\r\nto talk again about the 20th Century."\r\n\r\nThe children fidgeted in pleasure. She had turned on the sun five\r\nminutes ago and its beams through the window highlighted the youngness,\r\nthe eagerness of their faces, turned so trustingly to her.\r\n\r\nHere and there the sunlight flashed silver glints for instants on the\r\ntiny identification discs, smaller than 20th Century dimes in their\r\nforeheads and half hidden in the hairlines where they were inset in\r\neach person nowadays at birth.\r\n\r\nA small hand shot up.\r\n\r\n"Yes?" said Miss Hippiness.\r\n\r\n"Can we talk about the gangsters?" Marymarymary asked.\r\n\r\nAnother small hand jerked up, eagerly.\r\n\r\n"Yes?" said Miss Hippiness.\r\n\r\n"Can we talk about wars and bombs and things?" Henry Sixhenry asked.\r\n\r\nMiss Hippiness beamed on them. "Children, children," she scolded in\r\nfake sternness, "of course we can. But we\'ve talked about them all so\r\noften. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
Isn\'t there something else you\'d rather hear?"\r\n\r\nThe little hands sprouted like fast weeds.\r\n\r\n"Miss Hippiness--" "Miss Hippiness--"\r\n\r\nShe was called Miss Hippiness, even to her face now, and she didn\'t\r\ndislike it. Somewhere inside her the name had begun to give out a\r\npulsing warmth like a tiny real sun. Fifty years ago she would have\r\ndisintegrated any child who would have dared to call her such a name.\r\n\r\nHer eyes flicked at the disintegrator, still standing in its corner\r\nopposite the matter transmitter. But it was a dusty, dirty old\r\nthing. She hadn\'t used it in years. At home, she still had the hair\r\nribbon--they had been in style briefly that year among certain types of\r\nfamilies--the last little girl had been wearing the day she had walked\r\nso defiantly into the disintegrator.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMore frequently, the last year or so, Miss Hippiness had been troubled\r\nby nightmares in which the little girl\'s face peppered everything.\r\nStrange. She didn\'t remember the faces of those other children she had\r\nforced to march into the machine. But then, she had been much younger\r\nin those days, so much more a part of this contemporary world. And of\r\ncourse, that was before she had begun delving so avidly into history.\r\n\r\nMiss Hippiness had been teaching the first grade in the same\r\nschool--Official Learning Dome 111, called OLD Triple-One--for almost\r\nsixty years and she had been a great teacher. She had never been\r\na really large woman or a fat one. It was just that she tended to\r\nmassiveness in the one part of her anatomy, and ten years ago she had\r\nlet the massiveness really bloom.\r\n\r\nNever again had she given in to the pressures of fashion in a world\r\nwhere hips and breasts came and went on women like hemlines of the 20th\r\nCentury.\r\n\r\nThe 20th Century!\r\n\r\nMiss Hippiness let a dreaminess invade her eyes.\r\n\r\n"Children," she said in her fond voice, "the 20th Century has never\r\nbeen duplicated. It stands unique in history. Think of the richness of\r\nthat far age when a person could actually choose what he was going to\r\ndo in life, and where there were still hunger and sickness and want\r\nand--"\r\n\r\n"And wars," said little Charley Tencharles.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Miss Hippiness. "And accidents hurting people faster than\r\nseconds in a clock. And people fighting each other and cursing each\r\nother with words we don\'t even know any more."\r\n\r\n"Like someday-vitch," cried Marymarymary.\r\n\r\nMiss Hippiness rolled her eyes in joy. "It was son of a bitch, dear,"\r\nshe said. "It was a string of tiny real words that slished off the\r\ntongue like a string of bright little silver daggers."\r\n\r\n"Yes, teacher," the children chorused, squirming in wonder.\r\n\r\n"And there were the gangsters, those wonderful, wonderful eccentric\r\npersons, like the robinhoods and beowulfs I\'ve told you about. And\r\nyes, there were the bombs that went bam and boom and wham, and made\r\nbeautiful colors and high gorgeous mushrooming clouds--like the\r\npictures in the ancient book I smuggled in to show you the other day."\r\n\r\n"And people blown to bits," said Stan Thirtystanley in a fake grownup\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n"To little itsy-bitsy bits," Miss Hippiness cried. "The 20th Century,\r\nchildren. Ah, what happiness to have lived then, the whole world\r\nviolent and dangerous and seething and exciting like a string of\r\nstorybooks every inch of the way around the equator. But where you\r\ncould be an individual--your own boss, they used to call it."\r\n\r\nShe couldn\'t sit now. She raised her massive hips off the straight\r\nchair and began pacing up and down the room, her face like an ancient\r\ntelevision screen. And the children\'s eyes followed her like hungry\r\npuppies after a mama dog.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"It was the final splurge, children, of the individual man," she said.\r\n"Nowadays we have a world of people, all the same, all dull, all safe\r\nand healthy and secure. Then it was a world of persons. And in between\r\nevery bit of violence there was a cozy bit of restful safety. In\r\nbetween every bit of anger there was a silent bit of cozy peace. For\r\nevery tragic moment there was a moment of sunny happiness."\r\n\r\n"And were people really, really allowed to die by themselves?" asked\r\nCharley Tencharles.\r\n\r\nShe stopped and bent a loving glance on him. In the 20th Century he\r\nwould have been called Teacher\'s Pet. He was a dear and a doll and an\r\nangel.\r\n\r\n"Oh, many, many good people," she said, a catch in her voice, "died by\r\nthemselves. Imagine, some were taken by old age! And, as we said last\r\nweek, there were those wonderful sicknesses. A person could die of one\r\nof those. Nobody in the whole 20th Century had a card in the central\r\nbureau which had on it the date of their death. Think of it, children."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShe was wound up now, coming to the new part she had to tell them.\r\nThe part about electronics, which had been an infant science at the\r\nstart of the 20th Century. Matter transmitters were not known, nor\r\ndisintegrators. Robots were just on the horizon. Radio and television\r\ncame to flower. Man was just beginning to step off the face of the\r\nworld into deep space. And there were so few people on earth that\r\nthere were open fields all over every continent. Fine blowing trees\r\neverywhere, and real, live wild flowers.\r\n\r\n"Man started the 20th Century in complete privacy," she said, her vast\r\nhips quivering as she paced. "Then came the time--this was during the\r\nyears of the gangsters--when electronics helped man put tiny ears\r\nin rooms, behind pictures on the walls, so private speech could be\r\nrecorded. And telephones--did I tell you what telephones were?--could\r\nbe tapped, as they called it, so other people could listen in when you\r\nhad secrets to tell a friend."\r\n\r\nAnd then, she told them, late in the 20th Century came the best part of\r\nthe story--the discovery that man could "wiretap" other men so secretly\r\nthat nobody knew.\r\n\r\n"Think of it," she cried. "You could be telling your secrets to Papa.\r\nAnd then, later, Papa would be called in to a police station and his\r\nwiretap taken out and everything you said was recorded on a tiny spool\r\ninside him."\r\n\r\n"Ah," said the children, relishing the shudder of it all. It was\r\nlike a prehistoric ghost story, possible but weird because it had no\r\nconnection to known life.\r\n\r\n"But the human wiretaps didn\'t last long," said Miss Hippiness, making\r\na serious-comic face which brought a ripple of laughter to the twelve\r\nyoungsters. "By early in the 21st Century every part of the world had\r\npassed laws so nobody ever again could be wiretapped."\r\n\r\nShe looked at the clock. In two minutes the pills would wear off.\r\n\r\n"Enough for today, children," she announced.\r\n\r\n"But how about the gangsters?" Marymarymary asked in a petulant voice.\r\n"Please, Miss Hippiness, you said--"\r\n\r\n"Enough for today," Miss Hippiness said sternly. "It\'s time to go home.\r\nWe\'ll tell more stories tomorrow."\r\n\r\nShe said it just in time. The sun blinked out. A bell tinkled, and the\r\nschool day was over. The children stood up and waited.\r\n\r\n"All right," said Miss Hippiness with a smile. "Single file, children.\r\nTo the transmitter in your right order."\r\n\r\nThe children walked, like children always have, with spurting giggles\r\nand sudden scuffles, toward the gleaming wire cage, festooned with\r\npretty cutouts of colorful animals and buildings and trees.\r\n\r\nMarymarymary was always the first, this year. She stood in front of\r\nthe transmitter opening, let the electronic beam play on her forehead\r\nidentification disc, then stepped in.\r\n\r\nSwup. She was gone, delivered to her home, delivered to her mama and\r\npapa--and she wouldn\'t remember a thing of the "story hour," Miss\r\nHippiness thought happily. But maybe when she grew up, maybe when they\r\nall grew up, things would erupt here and there from their subconscious\r\nand--\r\n\r\nThey each stood their moment for the beam to catch their discs, stepped\r\nin and were swupped off. At last only Charley Tencharles was left\r\nand he scurried around, like teacher\'s pets immemorial, helping Miss\r\nHippiness do the last things a classroom needs to put it to rest for\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\nMiss Hippiness gave his shoulders a last motherly squeeze and pushed\r\nhim in front of the matter transmitter.\r\n\r\n"Tomorrow?" she said. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
His young grin was like wine in her blood. He\r\nstepped in and was swupped instantly.\r\n\r\nMiss Hippiness sighed and went back to sit on her straight chair. It\r\nwasn\'t comfortable and it wasn\'t pretty. But it somehow fit whatever\r\nhad been happening inside her the last year or two.\r\n\r\nShe glanced at the faint shimmer inside the transmitter where Charley\r\nhad been swupped. He was such a darling. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Quiet, shy, adorable. If they\r\nhad allowed her to have a son, instead of decreeing that she be a\r\nchildless teacher, she said. But she couldn\'t finish the thought.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was when the children went that she felt the growing anger and\r\nunrest and sickness inside her. It was terrible when the children left.\r\nShe wondered how long it had been now since she had seen the real\r\nsurface of the earth. She swupped back and forth, morning and night,\r\nfrom her sleeping room to her classroom. They were a thousand miles\r\napart, actually, but an instant apart through the transmitter.\r\n\r\nAnd she had been swupping to that old library in the south of what had\r\nbeen France to browse in the forgotten ancient books there. But she\r\nnever went outdoors. She never saw the sky anymore.\r\n\r\n"Why, it must be spring," she said aloud, "and I\'ve not seen a creek or\r\na river in--how long?"\r\n\r\nIf she had been allowed to have a son, and that son had been Charley\r\nTencharles, what fun it would have been to leave school every\r\nafternoon and be swupped to seashores, to brooks, to mountain peaks, to\r\nthe moon, to the tiny parks that still remained occasionally in cities.\r\n\r\nShe sat on her hard straight chair, uncomfortable but unmoving, for a\r\nhalf hour, deep in the reveries that so often beset her now.\r\n\r\nAnd then the beeper on the matter transmitter sounded. With a puzzled\r\nfrown she got up to press the admittance button.\r\n\r\nLittle Charley materialized and came out of the wire cage.\r\n\r\n"Charley," she cried. "Does your mama know you\'ve come back?"\r\n\r\nHe didn\'t answer. He went to stand in front of the straight chair and\r\nshe followed him, sitting down and putting her hands on his shoulders.\r\n\r\n"Charley," she said in her fake stern voice, "you should always ask\r\nyour mama before you--"\r\n\r\nCharley\'s lips came open but it wasn\'t Charley\'s little voice which\r\ncame out.\r\n\r\n"Susan Fiftysusan," said a deep grownup voice, "this is Holmes\r\nOneholmes. Remember? 

=== Chunk 5 ===
I was one of your pupils forty years or more ago."\r\n\r\nMiss Hippiness remembered instantly. She remembered Holmes as a child,\r\nbut she knew what he was now. He headed the bureau known only by an\r\nelectronic symbol. Too secret to name, it was said in high circles.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMiss Hippiness dropped her hands from little Charley\'s shoulders and\r\ncovered her face. Things twitched and twirked like little knives\r\nsomewhere deep inside her. Fear? Horror?\r\n\r\n"You were my greatest, my very best teacher," said Holmes Oneholmes\r\non the recording coming through little Charley\'s open lips. "And I\r\nhave treasured your memory. So you know how hateful is my task this\r\nafternoon."\r\n\r\nMiss Hippiness peeked at Charley\'s face through her fingers. His little\r\nblue eyes were blank, fastened to a spot high on the classroom wall\r\nbehind her. There was no tiny bit of expression on his face.\r\n\r\nShe heard Holmes Oneholmes cough and his voice went on, official this\r\ntime, all pupilness erased.\r\n\r\n"Susan Fiftysusan," he said, "the latest recording from inside Charley\r\nTencharles, which we have just heard, convicts you beyond reprieve.\r\nWhere you found the human-wiretap information we do not know. But\r\nwe\'ll find it, and destroy it. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
It is the order that your future\r\ndisintegration date is hereby superseded. Instead of disintegration\r\ntwo years and ten days from now, you will proceed to the nearest\r\ndisintegrator within the hour."\r\n\r\nMiss Hippiness lowered her face and her old eyes began sparking. Nobody\r\never knew their disintegration dates which the computers put on the\r\ncard at birth. Nobody ever knew when they had to march into one of\r\nthose horrid machines and cease living. But to learn that her own had\r\nbeen set a mere two years away--and she in the prime of life....\r\n\r\n"Son of a bitch," she said, using the first 20th Century epithet that\r\ncame to mind.\r\n\r\n"You are convicted," Holmes Oneholmes was saying, "of spreading\r\nsedition and danger to our entire world in an unthinkable way,\r\ntampering with the minds of our children--"\r\n\r\n"As if YOU don\'t tamper with children," she shouted.\r\n\r\n"--and it is the order that there be no appeal from this verdict."\r\n\r\nMiss Hippiness sat straighter. In the 20th Century, no matter what--for\r\ngangster, for statesman, for teacher--there would have been an appeal,\r\nand even another appeal, and perhaps another appeal. Life was still\r\nrich and treasured in the 20th Century.\r\n\r\nSo she held the 20th Century before her angry eyes, letting it blot out\r\nthe dirty old disintegrator in its corner. How had they learned what\r\nshe was doing to the sweet children?\r\n\r\nHolmes Oneholmes\' voice changed texture.\r\n\r\n"Miss Hippiness they call you now," he said, almost fondly. "We had\r\nanother name for you years ago." Almost a chuckle. "It was even better\r\nthan Miss Hippiness. Don\'t hate little Charley, Miss Hippiness. He is\r\nan android, naturally. We had him made last year after the Freudists\r\nbegan picking up troublesome things in the dreams of the children\r\nyou\'ve had in class. Charley has been our wiretap, Miss Hippiness."\r\n\r\nThe old teacher\'s eyes clamped on Charley Tencharles. But then they\r\nsoftened. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
She shook her head. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
It made no difference. If they had\r\nallowed her to have a son--\r\n\r\n"We caught an affection beyond affection," Holmes Oneholmes was saying,\r\n"in your voice when you talked to our android. So, since he has\r\nfinished his service to us, we--I--decided to send him back to you,\r\nMiss Hippiness. He will march into the disintegrator with you."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA faint click told her the recording inside Charley had played itself\r\nout. Charley moved almost immediately. His eyes came down from the high\r\nwall to her face.\r\n\r\nHe grinned.\r\n\r\nAnd she grinned back.\r\n\r\n"Charley Tencharles," she said gruffly, "can\'t you stay away from Miss\r\nHippiness? What a boy you are. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
You should be out playing, maybe in a\r\npark, maybe in a boat."\r\n\r\n"Or on a horse like in the 20th Century?" he asked.\r\n\r\nShe almost laughed. "Yes," she cried, "maybe like on a horse. With a\r\ngun on your hip--"\r\n\r\n"And a lasso to throw at things?"\r\n\r\nMiss Hippiness got up from the straight chair. It was so sweet, why\r\nwait? She took little Charley\'s hand and they walked toward the\r\ndisintegrator.\r\n\r\nThere was a dreadful moment of hesitation in front of it. Miss\r\nHippIness had heard of that last dreadful moment and she let it\r\nwrack her. Maybe this was a last relic of the 20th Century, a last\r\nreal-for-sure relic.\r\n\r\nCharley\'s hand moved in hers and she stooped quickly, enfolding him in\r\nher arms.\r\n\r\n"You know what?" she cried. "There was something else in the 20th\r\nCentury, Charley. It was kissing."\r\n\r\n"Kissing?" he said.\r\n\r\n"Yes, and I\'m going to kiss you, Charley Tencharles. Just like back\r\nthen.

=== Chunk 10 ===
"\r\n\r\nHe grinned as her lips came at him. "Aw, Miss Hippiness," he said.\r\n\r\nThere is an odd difference in the minute sounds made by matter\r\ntransmitters and disintegrators. The transmitter goes swup, no matter\r\nwho steps in. But the disintegrator goes schup, no matter who.\r\n\r\nMiss Hippiness stood up and took a deep breath, holding Charley tight\r\nin her arms, almost like a baby. She didn\'t have to look. Having sent\r\nso many naughty children into the disintegrator years ago, she knew the\r\nway.\r\n\r\nShe took the last three steps.\r\n\r\nSchup.\r\n\r\n                                THE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
