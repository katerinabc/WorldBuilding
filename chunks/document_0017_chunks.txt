Our little Centurian home is\r\ncrammed full with extra-terrestrial life forms as well. I put up with\r\nit as long as I could. Yesterday he brought home a native Centurian\r\nfemale. As you know it is a quasi-intelligent mammalian form with the\r\nbreasts and hips of a woman, fish scales and tail and a horned head.\r\nJohnny insists he\'s going to marry her. What shall I do?\r\n\r\n                                                      Distressed Mother\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dear Distressed_:\r\n\r\n_I suggest you contact your local fish and game department._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDear Nan Glanders:\r\n\r\nI am a hostess noted for my parties. Tomorrow we will have the\r\nSirian ambassador and 2 of his 3 wives coming for a dinner party. How\r\nmany forks and knives will be necessary for a guest with 3 sets of\r\ntentacles? Should I seat one of his wives on either side of him, or\r\nwhat?\r\n\r\n                                                                Worried\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dear Worried_:\r\n\r\n_Seating arrangements are unnecessary as Sirians prefer to hang\r\nattached by the dorsal suction disk from a ceiling fixture and suspend\r\ntheir elongated trunks to the table below. Just have a dish of adobe\r\ntype clay handy on the table and let them help themselves._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDear Miss Glanders:\r\n\r\nMy mother-in-law is a noted TK with a high range of ESP and Prescience.\r\nToday she asked me if I was pregnant. Do you think she could have\r\npeeked at my mind?\r\n\r\nP.S. I am 5 months along but still get into my everyday clothes with\r\nthe help of a safety pin.\r\n\r\n                                                              Concerned\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dear Safety-pinned_:\r\n\r\n_It\'s high time_ You _peeked--and buy a maternity smock while you\'re at\r\nit_.\r\n\r\n_Confidential to "What will it be?" I\'ve consulted an obstetrician\r\nfor you.

He said the baby_ has _to be human. A simple matter of\r\ndifferential chromosomes. So relax._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDear Nan:\r\n\r\nI was the victim of a billion to one transplat accident. When I came\r\nout of the transmitter after commuting to work one day, 2 extra copies\r\nof my original body rather than only the usual one were reassembled at\r\nthe receiving end. In other words I became triplets with each person\r\nhaving the same memories and all. Nobody was around so I decided not\r\nto report it to the transplat company. Until now I was an ordinary guy\r\nwho faithfully hands over his paycheck to the old girl every payday.\r\nDon\'t get me wrong, now. I\'m a happily married man but I do like having\r\na little spending money for myself and a night out with the boys every\r\nnow and then. So the three of us made a deal. While one of us went to\r\nwork, another one would be home and the third out on the town. We took\r\nturns, share and share alike. Then our wife caught two of us together\r\nand guessed the rest. She is suing for divorce and charging bigamy. We\r\nstill love her though.

How can we get her to listen to reason? Since\r\nthe case is in the newspapers anyway, I might as well sign my name.\r\nMarried for better or worse.\r\n\r\n                                                            Jimmy Jones\r\n                                                            Jimmy Jones\r\n                                                            Jimmy Jones\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dear Joneses_:\r\n\r\n_Either reintegrate, or draw straws and two of you skidoo._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDear Nan Glanders:\r\n\r\nI am a debutante on tour through the United Planets. I have never been\r\nso humiliated in my life. Yesterday I was presented to a Rigellian and\r\nhe spat on my new shoes. I would have slapped his face if I could have\r\ndecided which one to hit.\r\n\r\n                                                               Steaming\r\n\r\n_Dear Steaming_:\r\n\r\n_Simmer down. Spitting on the feet is the traditional Rigellian gesture\r\nof welcome. You should have replied by stepping on his tail. Next time\r\nread your tourists\' guide book better._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
