]\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Washington was the father of his country.\r\n\r\nI am not George Washington. My name is Andrew Jones, and it is because\r\nof me there will be no more Joneses in the world. There will be, in\r\nfact, no more anybody.\r\n\r\nThis is the end of the world.\r\n\r\nIt did not come through fire or ice, with a bang or a whimper, from\r\nsolar catastrophe or man\'s suicidal mis-use of atomic power or any\r\nof the other fearful possibilities with which the Sunday-supplement\r\nwriters once terrified us. It came through the exposure of an age-old\r\nconspiracy.\r\n\r\nI did it. My excuse is the eternal excuse of the scientist: I sought\r\nthe truth. How it was used was not my concern.\r\n\r\nBut that it should have led to the depopulation of the Earth concerns\r\nme, as it must concern every man, and I have an unshakable feeling of\r\nguilt.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I write this now in the hope that I may somehow purge myself. I\r\nknow that it will never be read.\r\n\r\nThe linen wick gutters in the saucer of melted tallow. It casts strange\r\nshadows on the cellar wall. Sometimes I think that they are the ghosts\r\nof children come to haunt me, the ghosts of all the little children who\r\nwill never be born.\r\n\r\nBut this is not what I sat down to write while I waited for Lindsay to\r\nreturn. What is keeping Lindsay? He should be back by now.\r\n\r\nI will begin again.\r\n\r\nMy name is Andrew Jones, and today, by my figures, is October 3, 1969.\r\nThe weather is turning cold here, and soon we must go looking for\r\nanother hiding place. My joints are getting old; the damp has seeped\r\ninto them. I long for the year-long warmth of California or Florida,\r\nbut those areas are still crowded and deadly.\r\n\r\nSomeone would recognize me.\r\n\r\nI think we will try a powerhouse again this winter. Often they have\r\nsupplies of coal large enough to last us through the cold weather\r\nwithout extra foraging.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCataclysm began in 1954, June 13 to be exact. That was the day my\r\nsecond child was born, a boy we named Kevin.\r\n\r\nIt is surprising that a man who was the father of two children should\r\naccuse himself of depopulating the Earth. And yet it is because I was\r\nthe father of two children that it happened.\r\n\r\nPre-natal care of mothers and post-natal care of infants were\r\nsubjects of compelling interest in those days, arriving monthly in\r\nthe burgeoning women\'s magazines and annually in the proliferous\r\nchild-care manuals. Pediatricians and mothers besieged parents with\r\nadvice, and we consumed everything with catholic appetite: logical,\r\nillogical, sensible, insensible, nonsensical, self-contradictory.\r\n\r\nThey kept us on our toes, strung as taut as Stradivarius violins,\r\nafraid to act for fear we would do the wrong thing, afraid not to act\r\nfor fear inaction would be disastrous. Pediatricians and mothers,\r\nalways the same authors. Never were there any articles on the care of\r\nmother and child by a father, only by what I came to think of as the\r\nvested interests.\r\n\r\nI was slow, I admit; but what father has not been slow? Who, if he had\r\nnot been slow, would be a father?\r\n\r\nThe books and the articles would have been troublesome enough if the\r\ninformation they imparted had been accurate. But slowly I became aware\r\nthat they were subtly interwoven with mis-statements.\r\n\r\nI raveled them out, I categorized them. I counted five different kinds\r\nbefore I convinced myself.\r\n\r\nA mother published this: "One baby takes up all your time--two can\'t\r\ntake any more."\r\n\r\nThe fallacy was obvious. A certain amount of housework was inescapable.\r\nIf the mother was unable to do the work, what happened to it?\r\n\r\nAnswer: somebody else did it.\r\n\r\nWho? Even in the abundance of those days, most of us couldn\'t afford\r\nnurses, maids, cooks, laundresses, or cleaning women. The era of the\r\npoor relation who came to help out for a few months was long past.\r\n\r\nWho did the work, then? The father, that\'s who.\r\n\r\nI stared deep into the shocking chasm between the mental processes of\r\nmen and women.\r\n\r\nI studied the statement again. There was no mis-statement at all--if\r\nyou granted the hidden premise and didn\'t boggle on the implication. It\r\nwas perfectly valid.\r\n\r\nThe hidden premise was that women did all the housework. But that\r\nhadn\'t been true for a generation. The husband-father had been drafted\r\ninto home service, and there was no discharge for him short of death or\r\ntotal disability.\r\n\r\nThe latter was hard to prove.\r\n\r\nBut the implication was the deadly thing: in the consideration of\r\nsecond child, a father\'s time and labor counted for nothing.\r\n\r\nI remembered a shaggy little story about a farmer who held up his hog\r\nto let it eat the corn off the stalk. "Doesn\'t it take a long time to\r\nfatten up a hog that way?" exclaimed the efficiency expert.\r\n\r\n"Shore," said the farmer, "but what\'s time to a hog?"\r\n\r\nAnd what, in a woman\'s eyes, was time to a father?\r\n\r\nThe second type of mis-statement was a pure omission. The thing\r\nthe baby books didn\'t mention was that most women felt ten times\r\nworse during their second pregnancies.[1] At this time life became\r\nalmost unbearable for them--and it was, as a consequence, completely\r\nunbearable for their husbands.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: Editor\'s note: This may help explain the size of the\r\n    average American family: 1.6 children.--W. M.

=== Chunk 3 ===
]\r\n\r\nNot one baby book or article mentioned that fact. That it was a fact I\r\nproved by a personal survey. Every mother questioned revealed that she\r\nfelt horrible during her second pregnancy. She was surprised that my\r\nwife and I didn\'t know this.\r\n\r\nI was not surprised. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Nobody ever mentioned it, that is why we didn\'t\r\nknow. I think it was at this time I first asked myself: _Is there a\r\nsubconscious conspiracy to keep this kind of information from leaking\r\nout?_\r\n\r\nIt wasn\'t important that women didn\'t know this. They had selective\r\nmemories (proof of this was that mankind lasted as long as it did).\r\nIf they were maternally inclined (as most of them were at one time or\r\nanother), the disadvantages of pregnancy faded into a sort of merciful\r\nblur.\r\n\r\nIf there was a conspiracy, it was aimed at fathers. It was intended to\r\nlull them into the logical supposition that conditions usually improve\r\nand that experience is the great teacher. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Pure delusion! With women,\r\nthings are always worse, and they are born with all the knowledge they\r\nwill ever need.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBabies could be divided into two kinds: "most" and "occasional."\r\nConsider, for instance, the following quotation: "Most babies in the\r\nearly months sleep from feeding to feeding; an occasional baby won\'t\r\nfall into this pattern but insists on being sociable after his meals."\r\n\r\nThe first time I read that I supposed that this business of "most" and\r\n"occasional" was a statistical matter. That was my fatal mistake. If\r\nthere was any statistical backing for that statement, I never found it.\r\n\r\nIn my experience, the chances were nine out of ten that--try as you\r\nwould--you would have an "occasional" baby.\r\n\r\nWe did. We had two of them.\r\n\r\nThe fourth type of mis-statement was the false generalization. It was\r\nsaid, much too often: "A full baby is a sleepy baby."\r\n\r\nThat is a re-statement of the quotation above.\r\n\r\nI sat down with a pencil and paper and figured it out. A small infant\r\ntook half an hour to finish a bottle. If he ate five times a day, he\r\nwould have spent 21-1/2 hours asleep out of every 24.\r\n\r\nA little farther on I would read something like: "If a baby wakes up\r\nearly, he is not getting enough to eat." I drew up a schedule:\r\n\r\n    _Baby wakes up (being hungry)._\r\n\r\n    _Baby gets fed (all he can hold)._\r\n\r\n    _Baby is sleepy (being fed)._\r\n\r\n    _Baby goes to sleep (being sleepy)._\r\n\r\n    _Baby sleeps until next feeding (being full)._\r\n\r\nI didn\'t recognize the baby. Who could? 

=== Chunk 6 ===
He wasn\'t my child or anybody\r\nelse\'s. He was the pediatrician\'s pipe-dream child.\r\n\r\nI looked at it another way: if the baby slept except when being\r\nfed, when did it get the baths, orange juice, vitamins, cereal, and\r\neverything else the pediatricians prescribed?\r\n\r\nHoist by their own petards!\r\n\r\nThe fifth type of mis-statement was the impossible ideal. I tried this\r\none for logic: "Babies should not be allowed to cry before feeding."[2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: Editor\'s note: This led to swallowing air which made\r\n    gas bubbles; gas bubbles caused colic.--W. M.]\r\n\r\nHad those doctors ever tried to keep a hungry child from crying?\r\n\r\nHungry children cried. It was their nature. Some of them--my kind for\r\ninstance--cried very hard. And children--even pipe-dream children--woke\r\nup hungry.\r\n\r\nWarming a bottle to drinkable temperature took time, at least five\r\nminutes and sometimes ten. Meanwhile, in spite of everything that\r\nanyone could do, the baby was crying. He would not he cajoled, walked,\r\nteased, patted, jollied, scolded, or argued into accepting any\r\nsubstitute for his formula. With him, it was food or nothing.\r\n\r\nFor horror, I had a favorite scene: the mother alone, rushing from\r\nbaby to bottle, from bottle to baby, one screaming, the other cold,\r\nfrantic with the pediatrician\'s admonitions, and then both too hot....\r\n\r\nI would not have had it on my conscience for all the royalties in\r\nAmerica! At least I have saved the world that.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere were more mis-statements, but those were enough. I did what any\r\nman, any scientist, would have done. I gave my findings to the world.\r\nThey were published under the title: "What the Baby Books Won\'t Tell\r\nYou." The article stirred up immediate controversy.\r\n\r\nIt is not enough to uncover a conspiracy; you must find a motive. I had\r\ndiscovered the motive behind the Great Conspiracy.\r\n\r\nBaby books were not written to teach parents how to care for their\r\nchildren; baby books were written to sell baby books. And magazines\r\npublished articles about babies to sell magazines to mothers.\r\n\r\nValid reasons. If they had not existed, there would have been no baby\r\nbooks, no women\'s magazines. But this had far-reaching consequences:\r\nthe market for baby books and women\'s magazines was the great,\r\nproliferating population of new parents. If the awful truth about\r\nparenthood were published, if these hardy, ingenuous souls were\r\ndiscouraged, something quite startling would happen to the market: it\r\nwould disappear.\r\n\r\nThere were attempts at suppression on all levels, but the truth was out\r\nand nothing could stop its spread. Secret printing presses turned out\r\nreprints by the millions; they were passed from hand to hand. Fathers\r\nwhispered the word to husbands; husbands passed it on to bachelor\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nThe word raced around the world.\r\n\r\nIt would not have been so disastrous if Lindsay McPherson had not\r\nsimultaneously perfected his contraceptive pill out of a Southwestern\r\nplant named _Lithospermum ruderale_. For the first time, a\r\ncontraceptive was safe, cheap, and convenient--and 100% effective in\r\nreducing _male_ fertility.\r\n\r\nBirth control was in the hands of the men.\r\n\r\nBillions of the tiny pills were turned out. Enemy nations sowed them\r\nover each other\'s territory in boxes containing translations of my\r\narticle. Men cached them away, carried them in money belts, hollowed\r\nout hiding places in the heels of shoes....\r\n\r\nBirths dropped suddenly. Almost overnight, the maternity wards were\r\ndepopulated. Hospitals went broke, or began advertising for patrons,\r\nsick or well.\r\n\r\nThe makers of baby foods, baby apparel, and baby accessories went next,\r\nthen the women\'s magazines when they lost their advertising. In a few\r\nyears, the condition hit the schools; one by one they closed their\r\ndoors.\r\n\r\nIt was a creeping paralysis. The toy makers and sellers collapsed. The\r\nclothing industry couldn\'t survive longer. The shoe-makers were hardest\r\nhit. Food consumption dropped. All over the country, farmers went\r\nbroke....\r\n\r\nBy comparison, the Great Depression seemed like a boom.\r\n\r\nBy 1965 the end was in sight. Society disintegrated. The cities were\r\ndeserted; they burned for years. From a mechanical-agricultural\r\ncivilization, the world returned to the stone age in one decade.\r\n\r\nPeople went in packs for protection. There were two kinds of them:\r\npacks of men hunting for food and packs of women hunting for men.\r\n\r\nSoon, as the women grow too old for child-bearing, the race of Man will\r\nbe doomed.\r\n\r\nI did it. I am guilty. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Lindsay helped, but I am the one. But how was I\r\nto know that society--that human life itself--was founded on a basic\r\ndeception?\r\n\r\nI wonder what is keeping Lindsay. He should be back by now.\r\n\r\n    _Editor\'s note: This manuscript was found in a cellar of a house in\r\n    a Midwestern city; it is presented here partly for its historical\r\n    interest, but chiefly for your amusement._\r\n\r\n    _Mr. Wilma Masters (the former Andrew Jones) was found in the same\r\n    cellar.
