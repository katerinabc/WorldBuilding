It seemed as if all this\r\npurple-sunned creation had conspired to isolate, to smash him. To the\r\nwest--for all planets share a west, if nothing else--the nuclear bombs\r\nbloomed, meaningless giant fungi. Invisibly overhead the spaceships\r\nroared, distant as gods, yet shaking the yellow sky. Even the soil was\r\ntreacherous, nauseated by artificial earthquakes--nobody\'s mother,\r\nleast of all an Earthman\'s.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you cheer up?" the others had said to him. "It\'s a mad\r\nplanet." But he would not cheer up, for he knew what they said was\r\nliterally true. Soon they would fall back and the enemy would retake\r\nthe mangled thing they called an objective. Was it the sixth time? The\r\nseventh? And did the soldiers on the other side have six legs, or\r\neight? The enemy were pretty haphazard as to what troops they used in\r\nthis sector.\r\n\r\nWorse was the noise. Meaningless, mechanical screeches tore at his\r\nskull, until thoughts rattled around in it like dry seeds in a dry pod.\r\nHe started to lift his hands to his ears, then checked the gesture,\r\nconvulsed with soundless laughter and tearless weeping, bitter memories\r\nand searing hatred. Once there had been a galactic society--a galactic\r\nempire--and he had played an unnoticed part on one of its nice quiet\r\nplanets ... but now? Galactic empire? Galactic horse-dung! Perhaps\r\nhe had always hated his fellow men as much as he did now. But in\r\nthe prewar days his hatred had been closely bound and meticulously\r\nrepressed. It was still bound, tighter than ever--but it was no longer\r\nrepressed.\r\n\r\nThe deadly engine he tended, silent for a moment, began again to\r\nchatter to those of the enemy; its voice was nearly drowned by their\r\nbooming ones, like a spiteful child in a crush of complacent adults....\r\n\r\nIt turned out that they had been covering a withdrawal of Martian\r\nsappers, and must now escape as best they might. They began to\r\nretreat. The officer running beside him fell. He hesitated. The\r\nofficer cursed a new, useless joint that had appeared in his leg.\r\nAll the others--including the black-shelled Martians--were ahead. He\r\nglanced around, fearfully, tormentedly, as if he were about to commit\r\na hideous crime. Then he lifted the officer and staggered on, reeling\r\nlike a top at the end of its spin. He was still grinning in a spasmic\r\nway when they reached the security of lesser danger; even when the\r\nofficer thanked him with curt sincerity, he couldn\'t stop grinning.\r\nNevertheless, they gave him the Order of Planetary Merit for that.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe stared at the watery soup and meat-shreds in his mess-tin. The\r\ncellar was cool, and its seats--though built for creatures with four\r\nlegs and two arms--were comfortable. The purple daylight was pleasantly\r\nmuted. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
The noise had gone a little way off, playing cat and mouse. He\r\nwas alone.\r\n\r\nOf course life had never had any meaning, except for the chillingly\r\nsardonic one perceptible to the demons in the nuclear bombs and the\r\nsilver giants in space who pushed the buttons; and he had no stomach\r\nto aspire to that. They\'d had ten thousand years to fix things, those\r\ngiants, and still all they could tell you was go dig yourself a hole.\r\n\r\nIn the old days the possibility of relaxation and petty\r\nself-indulgence, against the magnificent sham background of galactic\r\nempire, had permitted him to pretend life had a meaning. Yet at a time\r\nlike this, when such an illusion was needful, it ran out on you, jeered\r\nat you along with the lesser lies it had nurtured.\r\n\r\nA three-legged creature skipped out of the shadows, halted at a\r\ndistance, and subtly intimated it would like food. At first he thought\r\nit must be some Rigelian tripedal, but then he saw it was an Earth-cat\r\nlacking a leg. Its movements were grotesque, but efficient, and not\r\nwithout a certain gracefulness. How it could have got to this planet,\r\nhe found it hard to imagine.\r\n\r\n"But you don\'t worry about that--or even about other cats. Three-legs,"\r\nhe thought bitterly. "You hunt alone. You mate with your own kind, when\r\nyou can, but then only because it is most agreeable. You don\'t set up\r\nyour own species as a corporate divinity and worship it, and yearn over\r\nthe light-centuries of its empire, and eat out your heart because of\r\nit, and humbly spill your blood at its cosmic altar.\r\n\r\n"Nor are you hoodwinked when the dogs bark about the greatness of\r\nhumanity under a thousand different moons, or when the dumb cattle sigh\r\nfrom surfeit and gratefully chew their cuds under red, green and purple\r\nsuns. You accept us as something sometimes helpful. You walk into our\r\nspaceships as you walked up to our fires. You use us. But when we\'re\r\ngone, you won\'t pine on our graves or starve in the pen. You\'ll manage,\r\nor try to."\r\n\r\nThe cat mewed. He tossed it a bit of meat, which it caught in its\r\nteeth, shifting about cleverly on the two good hind legs. As he watched\r\nit daintily nibble (though scrawny with famine), he suddenly saw\r\nKenneth\'s face, just as he had last seen it on Alpha Centauri Duo. It\r\nseemed very real, projected against the maroon darkness towards the\r\nother end of the cellar. The full tolerant lips lined at the corners,\r\nthe veiledly appraising eyes, the space-sallow skin were all exactly as\r\nthey had been when they roomed together at the Sign of the Burnt-Out\r\nJet. But there was a richness and a zest about the face that he had\r\nmissed before. He did not try to move toward the illusion, though\r\nhe wanted to. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
He only looked. Then there came the sound of boots on\r\nthe floor above, and the cat bounded away, humping its hind quarters\r\nquite like a tripedal, and the vision quickly faded. For a long time\r\nhe sat staring at the spot where it had been, feeling a strangely\r\npoignant unhappiness, as if the only worthwhile being in the world had\r\ndied. Then he started to eat his food with the vague curiosity of a\r\ntwo-year-old, sometimes pausing with the spoon half-way to his mouth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was night, and there was a ground mist through which the\r\nwine-colored moons showed like two sick eyes, and anything might have\r\nbeen moving in the shadows. He squinted and peered over the rim of\r\nthe trench, but it was hard to make out the nature of any object, the\r\nlandscape was so torn and distorted. Three men came out of the place\r\nof underground concealment to the left, joking together in hushed,\r\nhollow voices. One whom he knew well (a stocky soldier with big eyes\r\nand smirking lips and reddish stubble on his chin) greeted him with a\r\nfriendly jibe about easy jobs. Then they wormed their way up and over,\r\nand started to crawl toward where enemy scouts (six legs or eight?)\r\nwere supposed to lie. He lost sight of them very quickly. He held his\r\nweapon ready, watching for the sight of the enemy.\r\n\r\nWhy did he hate the soldiers of the enemy so little? No more than a\r\nMartian hunting sand-dragons hates sand-dragons. His relationship with\r\nthem was limited, almost abstract. How could he hate something so\r\ndifferent from himself in form? He could only marvel that it too had\r\nintelligence. No, the enemy were merely dangerous targets. Once he had\r\nseen one of them escape death, and it had made him feel happy; he had\r\nwanted to wave in a friendly way, even if it could at best have only\r\nwriggled a tentacle in return--\r\n\r\nBut as for the men who fought side by side with him--he hated them\r\nbitterly, loathed their faces, voices, physical mannerisms. The way\r\nthis one chewed and that one spat. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Their unchanging curses, cliches,\r\nand jokes. All unendurably magnified, as if his nose were being\r\nrubbed in offal. For they were part of the same miserable, lying,\r\nself-worshipping galactic swarm as himself.\r\n\r\nHe wondered if he had hated the men at the office on Altair Una in the\r\nsame way--\r\n\r\nAlmost certainly. He recalled the long smoldering irritations\r\nover trifles that had seemed tremendous in the hours between the\r\nviolin-moans of the time clock ... but then there had been the safety\r\nvalves and shock absorbers that make life tolerable, and also the\r\nillusion of purpose.\r\n\r\nBut now there was nothing. And everybody knew it.\r\n\r\nThey had no right to joke about it and continue the pretense.\r\n\r\nHe was shaking with anger. To kill indiscriminately would at least\r\ndemonstrate his feelings. To focus death on the backs of men charging\r\nwith inane hysteria. To toss a nuclear fizz-bomb into a dugout where\r\nmen sought secret escape in dreams and repeated like prayers their\r\nrationalizations about galactic empires. Dying at his hand, they might\r\nfor a moment understand their own vicious hypocrisy.\r\n\r\nFrom out ahead, one of death\'s little mechanisms spoke concisely,\r\nrapidly. It seemed like a bugle call that only he could hear.\r\n\r\nRuby moonlight slid suddenly across the grotesquely tortured ground. He\r\nraised his weapon and took aim. Its sound pleased him because it was\r\nlike a soft groan of agony.\r\n\r\nThen he realized he had fired at the abruptly-revealed shadow because\r\nit was that of the stocky soldier who had jibed and crawled away....\r\n\r\nThe moonlight blacked out as if a curtain had been drawn. His heart\r\npounded. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
He ground his teeth and grinned. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
His feelings were fierce, but\r\nnot yet determinate. He became aware of the smells of the ground and of\r\nthe chemicals and metals; strong, sharp, interesting smells.\r\n\r\nThen he found himself staring at a whitish patch that never got more\r\nthan eight inches off the ground. Slowly it approached out of the\r\ndarkness, like the inquisitive head of a huge ghost worm. It became\r\na face with big eyes and smirking lips, fretted with red stubble.\r\nMechanically he reached out a hand and helped the man down into the\r\ntrench.\r\n\r\n"Were you the one that winged him? That lousy spider would have gotten\r\nme sure. I didn\'t see him until he fell on me."\r\n\r\nThis then was the end. Hereafter he would give in to the mob, run with\r\nthe hounds, die purposelessly like a lemming when the time came. Never\r\nagain would he aspire to the darker, icy insight that gave life a real\r\nthough horrible meaning. He was a ridiculous little communal animal in\r\na lemming-horde racing across the galaxy, and he would live like one.\r\n\r\nHe saw the small black object falling swiftly through the mist. The\r\nstocky soldier did not. There was a deafening blast, that slapped the\r\nskin. Looking up he saw the stocky soldier still standing there.\r\nWithout a head. As the body stumbled blindly forward, tripped and fell,\r\nhe began to laugh in little hissing gusts through his teeth. His lips\r\nwere drawn back, so that his jaw muscles twitched and pained him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe felt contemptuous amusement at the blond soldier. The blond soldier\r\nhad been to a third-rate nuclear technics school of some sort and\r\nbelieved it had been a serious mistake to put him in the infantry.\r\nNevertheless the blond soldier was ambitious and took an unusual\r\ninterest in the war.\r\n\r\nThey stood alone at the crest of a ridge thick with violet and\r\nyellow-spotted vines. In the valleys on either side, their units were\r\npushing forward. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Trails of dust and tracks of mashed vines extended\r\nas far as the eye could see. Various huge engines trompled forward,\r\ncarrying men, and other men ran fussily about, freeing engines that\r\nhad met with some stop or hindrance, as if the two were inextricably\r\nunited in an unimaginable symbiosis. Small machines bearing messengers\r\nwent swiftly to and fro like centaurs, a superior type of individual.\r\nOther machines spied watchfully overhead. It was like some vast,\r\nclumsy monster feeling its way; cautiously putting out pseudopods or\r\nhorns like a snail\'s; withdrawing them puzzledly when they touched\r\nanything hurtful or strange; but always gathering itself for a new\r\neffort. It did not flow, but humped and hedged and scuttled. Like an\r\narmy of Rigelian roaches. Or the driver ants of Earth that were so\r\nlike miniature Martians, with their black-weaponed soldiers, foragers,\r\nscouts, butchers, pack-carriers.\r\n\r\nAnd they were truly neither more nor less than ants. He was no more\r\nthan an epidermal cell in a monster that was dueling with another\r\nmonster, very careful of its inner organs but careless about its\r\nepidermis. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
There was something comfortingly abstract and impersonal\r\nabout the idea of being united in such a way with many other men, not\r\nbecause of any shared purpose, but merely because they belonged to the\r\nsame monster, a monster so large that it could readily do duty for fate\r\nand necessity. The fellowship of protoplasm.\r\n\r\nThe blond soldier murmured two or three words, and for a moment he\r\nthought the whole army had spoken to him. Then he understood and made\r\nthe necessary adjustment in the instrument they were setting up.\r\n\r\nBut those two or three words had plunged him with breathtaking\r\nabruptness into the worst sort of inner misery. What was abstract had\r\nbecome personal, and that was bad. To conceive a monster made of men\r\nwas one thing; to feel the insensate, inescapable prod of a neighboring\r\ncell and realize the stifling, close-packed pressure of the whole,\r\nwas another. He lifted his hand to his collar. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
The very air seemed\r\nto convey to his skin the shoving and jostling of distant, invisible\r\nindividuals. The nudge of the galactic horde.\r\n\r\nThey were at the end of the crest now, atop a little hillock, and he\r\nstared ahead to where the unknown objectives lay and where the air\r\nwas clearer. He felt as if he were suffocating. His new mood had come\r\nas utterly without warning as most of his moods now came, gushing up\r\nexplosively from some wild, alien, ever-expanding dimension within him.\r\n\r\nThen, in the broad expanse of fantastically clouded sky ahead of\r\nhim, he saw his friends\' faces again, orderly and side by side, but\r\ngigantic, like a pantheon of demigods. Just as he had in the cellar\r\nand several times since, only now altogether. The only faces that\r\nmeant anything in the cosmos. Black George, with the wide grin, that\r\nlooked, but was not, stupid. Hollow-cheeked Loren, peering up with\r\nshy canniness, about to argue. Dark Helen, with her proud, subtle\r\nlips. Sallow Kenneth again, with his veiledly appraising eyes. And\r\nAlbert, and Maurice, and Kate. And others whose features were blurred,\r\nheartbreakingly suggesting friends forgot. All transfigured and glowing\r\nwith warmth and light. As meaningful as symbols, yet holding each\r\nwithin itself the quintescence of individuality.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe stood stock-still, beginning to tremble, feeling great guilt.\r\nHow had he neglected and deserted them? His friends, the only ones\r\ndeserving his loyalty, the only island for him in the cosmos-choking\r\nsea of humanity, the only ones with worth and meaning; compared to\r\nwhich race and creed and humanity were without significance. It\r\nwas as self-evident and undeniable as a premise in mathematics.\r\nHeretofore he had seen only the masks of reality, the reflections, the\r\ncountershadows. Now, at a bound, he stood beside the gods in darkness\r\nwho pulled the wires.\r\n\r\nThe vision faded, became part of his mind. He turned, and it was\r\nas if he saw the blond soldier for the first time. How had he ever\r\nbelieved that he and the other soldier might have anything in common?\r\nThe gulf between them was far greater than if they had belonged to\r\ndifferent species. Why had he ever given two thoughts to such a silly,\r\nsquinty-eyed, bustling little organism? He never would again. It was\r\nall very clear.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll get them this time," the other soldier said with conviction.\r\n"We\'ve got the stuff now. We\'ll show the bugs. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
Come on!"\r\n\r\nIt was wonderful, hysterical, insufferable. Yesterday, spiders. Today,\r\nbugs. Tomorrow--worms? The other soldier really believed it was\r\nimportant and noble. He could still pretend there was that kind of\r\nmeaning and purpose to that sort of slaughter.\r\n\r\n"Come on. Get the beta cycling," said the other soldier impatiently,\r\nnudging him.\r\n\r\nIt was all very clear. And he would never lose that clarity. By one\r\naction he would cut himself off from the galactic pack and cleave\r\nforever to the faces in the sky.\r\n\r\n"Come on," ordered the other soldier, jerking at him.\r\n\r\nHe unsheathed his weapon, touched a button. Silently a dull black spot,\r\nnot a hole, appeared in the back of the blond soldier\'s head. He hid\r\nthe body, walked down the other side of the hill, and attached himself\r\nto another unit. By morning they were retreating again, the monster\r\nbadly hurt and automatically resisting disillusion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe was an officer now.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like him," said a soldier. "Of course, they all try to scare\r\nyou, whether they know it or not. Part of the business. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
But with him\r\nit\'s different. I know he doesn\'t talk tough, or threaten or act grim.\r\nI know he\'s pleasant enough when he takes time to notice you. Even\r\nsympathetic. But there\'s something there I can\'t put my finger on.\r\nSomething cold-blooded. Like he wasn\'t even alive--or as if _we_\r\nweren\'t. Even when he acts especially decent or thoughtful toward me, I\r\nknow he doesn\'t give a damn. It\'s his eyes. I can read meaning in the\r\neyes of a Fomalhautian blind-worm. But I can\'t read anything in his."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe soaring city seemed alien, though it had once been home. He liked\r\nit the better for that. Civilian clothes felt strange against his skin.\r\n\r\nHe whisked briskly along the sidewalk, taking the turns aimlessly when\r\nit split at the pedestrian cloverleafs. He looked at the passing faces\r\nwith frank inquisitiveness, as if he were at a zoo. He just wanted to\r\nenjoy the feeling of anonymity for a little while. He knew what he was\r\ngoing to do afterwards. There were his friends--and there were the\r\nanimals. The fortunes of his friends were to be advanced.\r\n\r\nBeside the next cloverleaf was a speaker, and a little crowd. There had\r\nbeen a good deal of that sort of stuff since the truce. Curiously he\r\nlistened, recognized the weakness of the words. They were sloshed with\r\nideas, tainted with unprofitable, poorly-selected hatreds. The call to\r\naction was tinged by an undercurrent of bitterness that argued inaction\r\nwould be better. They were civilized words, and therefore useless to\r\none who wanted to become an animal trainer on a galactic scale. What\r\na zoo he\'d have some day--and every single beast in it advertised as\r\nintelligent!\r\n\r\nOther words and phrases began to ooze up into his mind: "Thinkers!\r\nListen to me ... cheated of what you deserve ... misled by misled\r\nmen ... the galactic run-around ... this engineered truce ... the\r\ncreatures who used the war to consolidate their power ... the Cosmic\r\nDeclaration of Servitude ... life--to lose ... liberty--to obey ... and\r\nas for the pursuit of happiness--happiness is a light-millenium ahead\r\nof all of us ... our universal rights.... Free Martia! Terra for All!\r\nRevenge...."\r\n\r\nThese unspoken words, he felt, were the harbingers of leadership.\r\nAlexander had done it. Hitler had done it. Smith had done it. Hrivlath\r\nhad done it. The Neuron had done it. The Great Centaur had done it. All\r\nmurderers--for only murderers won. He saw the brilliant light-years of\r\nhis future ahead, endlessly. He saw no details, but it was all of the\r\nsame imperial color. Never again would he hesitate. Each moment would\r\ndecide something. Each of his future actions would drop like a grain of\r\nsand from an ancient hour glass, inevitable as time.\r\n\r\nProfound excitement seized him. The scene around him grew and grew\r\nuntil he seemed at the center of a vast, ominous, spellbound crowd\r\nthat filled the galaxy. The faces of his friends were close, eager and\r\nconfident. And from a great distance, as if from beyond the stars, he\r\nseemed to see his own face staring back at him, pale, skull-eyed, and\r\ninsatiably hungry.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
