He balanced\r\nhis frail, bulbous body on four of his eight limbs, while the other\r\nfour moved listlessly over the etheroscope, adjusting sights and\r\nlenses. N\'Zik wondered dully why he bothered. Even from here he could\r\nsee that the system looking ahead, the dull reddish Sun with its wild\r\nand darksome planets, was not for them.\r\n\r\nBitterness flooded his soul. To have come so far and searched so\r\nlong, only to find this! In all this Galaxy here was the one Sun that\r\nsustained a planetary system, and that Sun was dying! The irony was\r\nmore than he could bear.\r\n\r\nShi-Zik came to stand beside him. Only she and N\'Zik were left, of all\r\nthe thousands; two alone on this driving colossus which was the only\r\nworld they had ever known. She sensed his bitterness now and tried to\r\nspeak words of hope.\r\n\r\n"See, N\'Zik, there are inner planets! How close their orbits are! There\r\nmay still be warmth and life-sustaining rays."\r\n\r\nN\'Zik\'s limbs sprawled outward in despair.\r\n\r\n"This dying system is not for us, Shi-Zik. The five largest and\r\noutermost planets are but barren, frigid rock. But if you wish, we\r\nshall go inward."\r\n\r\nHis limbs flashed over the huge control-console. Gradually the ship\r\nslowed in its headlong pace. Nearly the size of a small planet, was\r\nthis ship; entire generations had been born and died aboard it, during\r\nthe trip between Galaxies. Somewhere deep inside, perpetual generators\r\npounded out the power that had driven them through space faster than\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nN\'Zik and Shi-Zik had never seen those generators, nor were they\r\nconscious now of the smooth threnody. They had known it always. Miles\r\nof inter-locking corridors extended behind them too, a veritable city\r\nwith vast rooms of wonderful machinery--but none of this had they ever\r\nseen. For DEATH had struck suddenly there, was lurking there still.\r\n\r\nThe huge metal tomes told of it. N\'Zik and Shi-Zik had read that\r\nhistory so often that they knew it now by heart. They knew how and why\r\nthe last generations had been wiped out.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first scientists had planned well for the safety and well-being\r\nof the generations to come, but they had overlooked one thing. Within\r\ntheir own Galaxy they had been cognizant of certain cosmic rays, which\r\nwere harmless insofar as they had no apparent effect on living tissues.\r\nHowever, in that utter vacuity between Galaxies _no such rays existed_!\r\nAnd there between Galaxies new generations were born. Five, ten, a\r\ndozen generations. And at last--they had reached the new Galaxy....\r\n\r\nWhether the cosmic rays here differed, or whether the new generations\r\nhad simply lost all resistance to them, was never fully known. The\r\nrace had died by thousands as the hard rays penetrated the ship. The\r\nscientists worked feverishly to build up a section with layers of\r\ntheir heaviest metals; but by the time they had achieved a sufficient\r\nthickness, a few dozen had survived.\r\n\r\nN\'Zik and Shi-Zik were the last of that final group.\r\n\r\nNow, under N\'Zik\'s sure guidance, the ship crossed the orbits of the\r\nouter planets. He had thrown over the deceleration control, but their\r\nspeed was still tremendous.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes craggy fragments of rock were skimming past their\r\nhull. The larger ones were deflected by automatic repulsion plates and\r\nthe few that drifted through became molten upon contact. Such was their\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\nThen they were through the swarm, and N\'Zik remarked, "This is an old\r\nsystem indeed. At one time a planet must have occupied that orbit."\r\n\r\n"Look." Shi-Zik\'s spider-like body was taut with eagerness as she\r\npointed to a planet far ahead, swinging away from their trajectory.\r\n"Shall we follow it?"\r\n\r\n"There is no purpose.

We can pick it up in the etheroscope." 

=== Chunk 4 ===
N\'Zik\r\nadjusted the sights. The planet together with its two moons leaped into\r\nview on the screen. N\'Zik manipulated the magnilens and it was brought\r\nstill nearer.\r\n\r\nVast icy caps encompassed most of this world. The rest was frozen\r\ndesert, slightly reddish, with a few peculiar straight-line markings\r\nthat might have been man-made. But that didn\'t interest them now.\r\nIt was all too apparent that this planet had been uninhabitable for\r\nmillennia.\r\n\r\n"Dead. A frozen, dead world," Shi-Zik intoned. "Let us go on to the\r\nnext one."\r\n\r\nThey moved ever inward. The next planet with its single satellite\r\noffered no more promise. Here they saw stark mountain ranges in\r\ncontrast to vast hollows that might have been dead ocean bottoms. The\r\nmagnilens picked out several cities, tottering, crumbling in ruin.\r\n\r\n"Cities," N\'Zik muttered. "Cities still standing on this airless world.\r\nA civilization once existed here, and it cannot have been so long ago.\r\nShall we go on, Shi-Zik? There are two or three other planets but I\r\nfear they will offer no more than this."\r\n\r\nNow something of N\'Zik\'s despair came upon Shi-Zik. "No, we need not\r\ngo on. I feel weary of it all. I care not if we ever find the place we\r\nseek."\r\n\r\n"I too, have had this feeling," N\'Zik waved his limbs in agreement.\r\n"Shi-Zik, we have searched this Galaxy through. There may yet be\r\nlife-giving Suns with planets, but we have not much time. Of late I\r\nhave felt the engines becoming sluggish of power...."\r\n\r\n"True. The way has been long." 

=== Chunk 5 ===
She gestured hopelessly. "Do you suggest\r\nthen, that we put an end to the mission?"\r\n\r\n"Not without your consent, Shi-Zik."\r\n\r\n"I have wanted to end it!" Shi-Zik cried. "For a very long time I have\r\nthought of it, but dared not speak."\r\n\r\n"And yet," N\'Zik mused, "perhaps we should search further. Search until\r\nthe end. It was the will of our forebears that the race be continued.\r\nShould we end so ingloriously what they set out to achieve?"\r\n\r\n"The will of our forebears is as nothing to the will of Praav," Shi-Zik\r\nspoke softly, gazing out to the stars. "Praav has watched safely over\r\nus all this time. If He had wanted us to find a place, we should have\r\nfound it. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
And we need not end ingloriously. Observe, N\'Zik, that we,\r\nthe last of our kind, have ended here, at what is probably the last\r\nplanetary system. Its sun is dying as our race is dying. Let us all go\r\nout in a final flame together, a blaze of glory!"\r\n\r\nThe bitterness had left N\'Zik now. "You are right, my dear. It was\r\nmeant that we should end here. I believe Praav has willed it so!"\r\n\r\nHe threw the controls over to full acceleration and locked them\r\ninto place. The colossus of all spaceships piled acceleration upon\r\nacceleration with the speed of light, plunging on its unerring course\r\ntoward the dying Sun. The two beings from another Galaxy stood at the\r\nforward port, proudly side by side. N\'Zik looked at Shi-Zik and felt\r\nsuch a peace as he had never known.\r\n\r\nAnd Shi-Zik murmured, "Praav, in his inscrutable wisdom...."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCurt Sanders climbed wearily up the last steep passage from the city\r\nbelow. Space-suited and helmeted, he emerged from the low line of\r\ncliffs and looked out upon the desolate surface of Mercury.\r\n\r\nFor the past week he had worked hard in the underground laboratories.\r\nOccasionally he came to the surface where he could see the dark sky,\r\nand the pin-points of stars, and the dying Sun once more. That alone\r\ngave him incentive to go on. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
He, with the several thousand others,\r\nwere working out the problem which might save them from extinction. It\r\nwas slow work, damnably slow and hard, and Curt knew in his heart they\r\nwould not be in time.\r\n\r\nHe raised his face to the red orb whose heat scarcely touched\r\nhere. Again he marvelled that disaster had come so suddenly. Solar\r\nradiation was not supposed to end like that! It should have gone on\r\nfor millennia. That\'s what the scientists had preached. But it had\r\nended--scarcely five hundred years ago. Curt had never known Earth,\r\nonly the city here far within Mercury, where there was meager warmth\r\nand light. And now even the internal heat of Mercury was fast cooling.\r\n\r\nCurt turned at the sound of footsteps behind him. That would be Olana.\r\nShe, too, came here each week.\r\n\r\nShe stopped beside him, raised her helmeted face to Sun and stars\r\nwith infinite longing. For a moment neither of them spoke. Then Olana\r\nclicked on her helmet radio.\r\n\r\n"Each time, Curt ... each time I come here I imagine the Sun has grown\r\ndimmer. Is it really only my imagination?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. It becomes dimmer, but not perceptibly. Solar radiation is\r\nelectronic, and the theory is that our Sun has merely exhausted an\r\nouter sheath of electrons. Lord knows what internal condition caused\r\nit! If it\'s a solid body, it may be due to certain peculiarities of\r\nthe strata. The sun spots of hundreds of years ago must have been the\r\nbeginning of the end."\r\n\r\nShe nodded. "How is the work coming?"\r\n\r\n"The Traction Rays? Slowly, Olana--too slowly." Curt shook his head\r\nin weariness. "We\'re in the process of testing, but they are still\r\nnot strong enough. It means months more of work, and we shall need\r\nhundreds! You know, if we fail on the first attempt we shall not have\r\nanother chance."\r\n\r\n"I--I still don\'t quite understand it," Olana was puzzled. "I know it\r\nhas something to do with the orbit of Vulcan. But how can it save us?"\r\n\r\n"It may not. It\'s a forlorn chance. You know of course that Vulcan\'s a\r\nvery small planet, scarcely larger than Earth\'s moon. And it pursues\r\nan orbit much closer to the Sun than Mercury. If we can drive it out of\r\nits orbit with the Traction Rays, it may fall into the Sun!"\r\n\r\n"But suppose," Olana pointed out, "it only takes up a closer orbit?"\r\n\r\n"Exactly why we\'re taking no chances. We must be sure our rays are\r\nstrong enough to _propel_ it into the Sun."\r\n\r\n"And what then?"\r\n\r\nCurt shrugged. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
"After that it\'s anybody\'s guess. Professor Marston\r\nbelieves that such a collision will set up a combustion sufficient to\r\nrelease internal electronic action from the Sun\'s depths. And, once\r\nthat is started, the Sun will blaze again."\r\n\r\n"I see," Olana exclaimed. "Something like stirring up dying embers!"\r\n\r\n"Yes." There was no eagerness in Curt\'s voice. "No doubt there are\r\nforces within the Sun sufficient to last for millennia, if they could\r\nonly be released. But they must be deep within. I\'m afraid nothing we\r\ndo with Vulcan will be enough."\r\n\r\n"Why, you\'re just a pessimist!"\r\n\r\nCurt smiled wanly. "No, just realistic. And very tired! It\'s been a\r\ntrying week. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
Come, we\'d better be getting back."\r\n\r\n"Wait." Olana stopped him. She was gazing at the blackness beyond the\r\nhorizon\'s rim. "Curt, look."\r\n\r\n"Meteor?" He followed her gaze. "No! I never saw a meteor like _that_!"\r\n\r\nThey saw a patch of light against the reddish sunglow. It wasn\'t\r\nextended light, it seemed to move as a bulk and with such speed as no\r\nmeteor had ever attained. For half a minute they watched it become\r\nsmaller--then it disappeared. Curt shook his head in puzzlement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _They saw a patch of light against the reddish sunglow._]\r\n\r\n"That beats me! For a minute I had a feeling--yes, I was _right_! It\r\nwent straight into the Sun! Olana--!"\r\n\r\nBut she had seen, too. She was scarcely aware of Curt\'s fierce grip on\r\nher arm.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDirectly in the center of the maroon Sun a tiny pinpoint of white had\r\nappeared. Even as they watched, it seemed to mushroom slowly outward.\r\n\r\n"That was no meteor!" Curt exclaimed. "Whatever caused that explosion\r\nwas travelling at the speed of light, and must have had tremendous\r\nbulk! Why ... I doubt if even Vulcan striking with its orbital velocity\r\ncould cause such a display!"\r\n\r\nFor an hour they watched. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
At the end of that time the whitish glow had\r\ngiven no sign of receding; if anything, it had become ever so slightly\r\nlarger. They stared, entranced with a new hope.\r\n\r\nAt last Olana placed a hand on Curt\'s arm and murmured, "God, in his\r\ninscrutable wisdom...."\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
