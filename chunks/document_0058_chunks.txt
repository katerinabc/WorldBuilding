]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe older man sat down on the grassy bank on the hill overlooking the\r\norchard. The autumn sun was bright but the humidity was low and there\r\nwas a breeze.\r\n\r\nThe younger man sprawled next to him.\r\n\r\n"Cigarette?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Thanks," said Roger Boynton. He looked across the valley, past the\r\napple trees, to the fine white-columned house on the hill beyond. He\r\nsmiled reminiscently. "A friend of mine once owned that house. A fellow\r\ncommissioner in World Government. He and I used to sit on this very\r\nhill, sometimes. We\'d munch on an apple or two that we\'d picked on our\r\nway through the orchard. Winesaps, they\'re called."\r\n\r\n"You were telling me about the colonizing," said Allister gently, after\r\na pause.\r\n\r\nThe older man sighed. "Yes." He put out the cigarette carefully,\r\nstripped it, scattered the tobacco and wadded the paper into a tiny\r\nball. "I was commissioner of colonies. I had to decide, after my staff\r\nhad gathered all the data, who would be the best man to put in charge.\r\nIt was no easy decision."\r\n\r\n"I can imagine.

=== Chunk 3 ===
"\r\n\r\n"You can\'t really. There were so many factors, and the data were\r\nactually quite skimpy. The way it worked out, to be candid with you,\r\nwas on the basis of the best guess. And some of the guesses were pretty\r\nwild. We knew Mars was sandy, for instance, and so we put a Bedouin\r\nin charge. That pleased the Middle East, in general, and Jordan in\r\nparticular. Jordan donated a thousand camels under Point Four point\r\nfour."\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon?" said Allister.\r\n\r\n"That\'s not double-talk. Point Four was the old terrestrial program for\r\nunderdeveloped countries. World Government adopted it and broadened it.\r\nMars is the fourth planet, so--" he traced 4.4 in the air, stabbing\r\na finger at the imaginary point "--Point Four point four. It was\r\nundoubtedly somebody\'s little whimsy in the beginning, but then it\r\nbecame accepted for the descriptive term that it was.

"\r\n\r\n"I see."

The young man looked vague. He stubbed out his cigarette\r\ncarelessly, so that it continued to smolder in the grass.\r\n\r\n"Venus was the rainy planet," Boynton said, looking with disapproval\r\nat the smoking butt, though he did nothing about it, "so we put an\r\nEnglishman in charge. England sent a crate of Alligators."\r\n\r\nThe young man looked startled.\r\n\r\n"Alligator raincoats," Boynton said. "Things weren\'t very well\r\norganized. Too many things were happening too fast. There was a lot of\r\nconfusion and although the countries wanted to do what was best, no one\r\nknew exactly what that was. So they improvised as best they could on\r\nthe basis of their little knowledge."\r\n\r\n"Was it a dangerous thing?"\r\n\r\n"The little knowledge? No, not dangerous. Just inefficient. Then there\r\nwas Jupiter. We didn\'t bother about Mercury, although for a time there\r\nwas some uninformed talk about sending an Equatorial African to do what\r\nhe could."\r\n\r\n"Who went to Jupiter?" Allister asked.\r\n\r\n"The United States clamored for Jupiter and got it. The argument was\r\nthat the other planets would be a cinch to colonize because of their\r\nsimilarity to Earth but that Jupiter needed a real expert because it\r\nhad only its surface of liquid gas and the Red Spot."\r\n\r\n"What\'s that?

=== Chunk 6 ===
"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry. I\'d forgotten you were just a youngster when all this was\r\ngoing on. The Red Spot is the Jovians\' space platform. They built it\r\na long time ago and then they retrogressed, the way people do, and\r\nforgot how they\'d done it. Earth sent an engineer to see if it could\r\nbe done again. The Spot was pretty overpopulated and no real job of\r\ncolonization could be done until we built one more."\r\n\r\n"And did you?"\r\n\r\n"Well, we started to. Before we could really go to work anywhere,\r\nthough, we had to solve the language problem. An Australian went to\r\nwork on that. He\'d had a background of Melanesian pidgin, and if anyone\r\nwas suited to the job of cross-breeding four languages into one, he\r\nwas."\r\n\r\n"Four languages?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. English was the official language of Earth. Then there was\r\nMartian, Venusian _chat-chat_, and Spotian. It was a queer amalgam, but\r\nit could be understood by everyone, more or less."\r\n\r\n"So that\'s where it came from. _Chikker-im-up-im chat-chat too-much_,\r\neh? Interplanetary _b\xc3\xaache de mer_."\r\n\r\n"Exactly. Only of course it was called _b\xc3\xaache d\'espace_. _Me two-fellah\r\nvimb\' kitch-im pjoug by\'m by._ But even after the language difficulty\r\nwas solved, we had our troubles. They already had camels on Mars,\r\nfor instance, and the Martians were amazed when we brought in more.\r\nParticularly because theirs were wild and semi-intelligent and the\r\nfirst thing the Martian camels did was come over and liberate their\r\nbrothers from Earth. They never did come back.\r\n\r\n"Same sort of thing with the raincoats on Venus. It doesn\'t rain\r\n_down_ there, as we know now. It sort of mists _up_. From the ground.\r\nSoaks up under a raincoat in no time. These were just petty annoyances,\r\nof course, but they were symptomatic of the way our half-baked planning\r\noperated."\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t know about the people of Ganymede then?"\r\n\r\n"No. We were so busy trying to build another Red Spot that we never\r\ndid get to Jupiter\'s satellites. Oh, it was partly a matter of\r\nappropriations, too. The budget commission kept explaining to us that\r\nthere was only so much money and that we\'d better show a profit on what\r\nwe had before we put in a request to go tooling off to colonize some\r\nnew place. I guess the \'Medeans first came when you were about ten?"\r\n\r\n"Eleven," the younger man said.\r\n\r\n"They scouted our colonies and came directly to Earth. They took right\r\nover and colonized _us_."\r\n\r\nA \'Medean overseer climbed the hill effortlessly. He was tall and\r\ntentacled and the breathing apparatus over his head gave him the\r\nappearance of a mechanical man.\r\n\r\n"_Kigh-kigh pinis_," the \'Medean said. "_You two-fella all-same\r\nchat-chat too-much. B\'phava b\'long work he-stop \'long orchard pick-im\r\napple._"\r\n\r\nThe two men stood up and obediently walked down the hill toward the\r\napple orchard.\r\n\r\n"Why does he have to talk to us in that pidgin?" the young man asked.\r\n"They all speak English as well as you and me. It\'s insulting."\r\n\r\n"That\'s why they do it, I think," said Boynton, the former commissioner\r\nof colonies. "They\'re so much better at colonizing than we were that I\r\nguess they feel they have a right to rub it in."\r\n\r\nThe \'Medean had overheard them.\r\n\r\n"Damn right," he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
