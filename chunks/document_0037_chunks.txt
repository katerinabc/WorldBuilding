Mort Eddison, his best friend,\r\nlooked at him reprovingly; the class had been in session for almost\r\nfifteen minutes, and one just didn\'t come late to Professor Carner\'s\r\nlecture. Especially on the first day.\r\n\r\nEddie breathed easier as he saw that Professor Carner\'s back was to the\r\nclass as he completed a diagram on the blackboard.\r\n\r\n"Now then," Carner said. "Suppose you were writing about the--ah--the\r\nVenusian Threngener, which, as you know, has three legs. How would you\r\ndescribe it?"\r\n\r\nOne of the students raised his hand. "I\'d call it a three-legged\r\nmonstrosity, spawned in the deepest hells of--"\r\n\r\n"No," Carner said quietly. "That kind of writing might have been all\r\nright in the earliest days of our subject. But remember: You are no\r\nlonger dealing with a simple, credulous audience. To achieve the proper\r\neffects nowadays, you must _underplay_! Understand? Underplay!

Now,\r\nsomeone else?"\r\n\r\nMort raised his hand, threw a glance at Eddie, and said: "How about,\r\n\'this tri-pedal blob of orange protoplasm, octopus like in its\r\ngropings--\'"\r\n\r\n"That\'s better," Carner said. "Tri-pedal is very nice, very exact. But\r\nmust you compare it to an octopus?"\r\n\r\n"Why not?" Mort asked.\r\n\r\n"An octopus," the professor said, "is a well-known form of Earth\r\nlife. It inspires no terror, no wonder. You might better compare the\r\nThrengener to _another_ strange monster; a Callistan Eddel-splayer, for\r\nexample." He smiled winningly at the class.\r\n\r\nEddie frowned and scratched his blonde crewcut. He had liked it better\r\nthe first way. But Carner should know, of course. He was one of the\r\nbest-known writers in the entire field, and he had done the college a\r\nfavor by agreeing to teach the course. Eddie remembered reading some\r\nof Carner\'s stuff. It had scared the living daylights out of him when\r\nhe was younger. That description of Saturnian brains immobilizing\r\nEarth-confederation ships, for example. That had been a great yarn.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe trouble is, Eddie thought, I\'m just not interested. He had had\r\nserious doubts about this course. Actually, he had signed up only\r\nbecause Mort had insisted.\r\n\r\n"Any questions at this point?" Carner asked. One of the students--a\r\nserious-looking fellow wearing black horn-rimmed glasses--raised his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n"Suppose," he asked, "suppose you were writing a story speculating on\r\nan interstellar combine formed with the purpose of taking over Earth?\r\nWould it be permissible, for greater contrast, to make Earth\'s enemies\r\nblack-hearted villains?"\r\n\r\nA political thinker, Eddie thought with a sneer. He glanced hopefully\r\nat the clock.\r\n\r\n"It wouldn\'t be advisable." Carner sat casually on the corner of his\r\ndesk. "Make them human also; show the reader that these aliens--whether\r\nthey have one head or five--have emotions understandable to them. Let\r\nthem feel joy and pain. Show them as being misguided. Pure evil in your\r\ncharacters has gone out of fashion."\r\n\r\n"But could I make their leader pure evil?" the young man asked, busily\r\njotting down everything Carner had said.\r\n\r\n"I suppose so," Carner said thoughtfully. "But give him motivations\r\nalso. By the way, in dealing with that sort of story--the panoramic\r\nkind--remember not to oversimplify the aliens\' problems. If they amass\r\nan army of twenty million, all have to be fed. If the rulers of fifty\r\nscattered star systems meet in conclave, remember that different star\r\nsystems have different languages, and different races have different\r\nnervous systems. Bear in mind also, that there would be little logical\r\nreason for attacking earth; the galaxy is filled with so many stars and\r\nplanets, what is the necessity of fighting for one?"\r\n\r\nThe horn-rimmed fellow nodded dubiously, writing his notes with\r\ntremendous speed. Eddie stifled a yawn. He preferred to think of his\r\nvillains as pure unadulterated evil; it made characterization so much\r\neasier. And he was getting tremendously bored.\r\n\r\nCarner answered questions for the next half hour. He told them not to\r\ndescribe Venus as a \'jungle-choked green hell,\' never, never to call\r\nthe moon \'pock-marked,\' \'small-pox pitted,\' or \'scarred from centuries\r\nof meteoric bombardment.\'\r\n\r\n"All this has been said," he explained. "Millions of times. _Do not_\r\nuse cliches."\r\n\r\nHe went on to explain that the red spot of Jupiter need not be called a\r\nmalevolent red eye, that Saturn\'s rings don\'t necessarily resemble a\r\nhalo, and that the inhabitants of Venus are not Venetians.\r\n\r\n"All common errors," he said. "I want a thousand words from each of you\r\nnext time. I suggest that you choose a planet and write a fresh study\r\nof it, avoiding with care all the cliches I mentioned. Class dismissed.

"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Well, whadja think?" Mort asked Eddie in the hall. "Isn\'t he great? I\r\nmean, he really _knows_!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m dropping out of the class," Eddie said, making up his mind.\r\n\r\n"What! Why?"\r\n\r\n"Well," Eddie said, "There\'s no reason why I shouldn\'t call the red\r\nspot on Jupiter a malevolent red eye. I put that in a story last month,\r\nand it sounded good. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
And that Venetian Threngener--I think it\'s a\r\n_monstrosity_, and I\'m going to write about it that way."\r\n\r\nHe paused, and his face hardened with conviction.\r\n\r\n"But the real reason--well, I\'m just not interested in journalism. I\'m\r\ndropping Carner\'s course in fact feature-article writing, because I\r\nwant to write fiction!"\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
