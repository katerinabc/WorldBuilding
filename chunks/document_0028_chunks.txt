Major Reynolds_\r\n\r\n\r\n Henderson\'s lovely flowers were going to bring\r\n him fame--until they walked and talked too much.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ringing of the door bell cut into Henderson\'s concentration and he\r\nmade a gesture of irritation with one outflung hand. But he didn\'t raise\r\nhis head or shift his eyes one iota from the tiny green thing on his\r\nlaboratory table. Tensely absorbed, he stood watching the small miracle\r\nhe had made and emotion approaching exultation gripped him.\r\n\r\nHe slid one hand toward a switch, never moving his eyes from the table.\r\nThe infinitesimal movement of his hand increased the power throb in the\r\nmachine at his side so imperceptibly that only he could be aware of it.\r\n\r\nSuddenly his breath exploded in what was almost a squeal of delight.\r\n\r\nThe small green plant on the table was with great effort extending a\r\npair of tiny rootlets and was trying to use them to walk!\r\n\r\nAs Henderson watched, spellbound, the sudden cessation of the doorbell\'s\r\nring went unnoticed. He stood there, willing with every cell of his body\r\nthe miracle that would make that small shred of green take the first\r\nvital step.\r\n\r\nSlowly, slowly it struggled to an upright position, stood wavering.\r\nHenderson increased the power with a trembling hand and almost forgot to\r\nbreathe as he waited for the miracle which followed.\r\n\r\nSeveral more rootlets abruptly appeared, and now the plant balanced\r\nitself easily on the bare table. Then slowly, as a long minute passed,\r\none of the roots made an uncertain step, then another and another, until\r\nit was walking unsteadily across the surface of the table!\r\n\r\nHenderson, his face--even his lips--white with excitement, now reached\r\nfor another switch. Before turning it on he adjusted a tiny microphone\r\non the edge of the table. Then he turned the screw switch ...\r\n\r\nInstantaneously the laboratory was filled with a rustling. Then there\r\ncame a series of tiny squeaks that sounded strangely like a voice\r\nspeaking. Henderson sat spellbound, watching, listening ...\r\n\r\nThe door bell rang again, but this time he didn\'t even hear it. Nothing\r\ncould break the spell which held him in his seat before the first\r\ntalking and walking plant the world had ever known.\r\n\r\nHe picked up an alternate phase microphone and spoke into it. His voice\r\nissued from a tiny speaker beside the plant as a small whisper of\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n"Man!" his voice whispered, "Man!" He nearly yelled his delight as the\r\nsmall green thing echoed the word!\r\n\r\nHe shut off the mike, then, and got busy. He sat down and began to plan\r\na vocabulary to educate his plant. When that was done he would stun the\r\nworld with a demonstration of his genius ...\r\n\r\nIt was some time before he realized there was a ghost of a voice coming\r\nfrom someplace in the room. He looked at the plant on the table, but it\r\nwas standing quiescent.\r\n\r\nHenderson stared around the laboratory, frowning. Then a movement at the\r\nwindow caught his eye.\r\n\r\nHis mother\'s prize geranium was struggling to free itself from the soil\r\nin the window box! And it was muttering! Henderson blushed as he made\r\nout some of the words the flower was muttering. That plant had been in\r\nthe room with him during some of his most dismal scientific failures,\r\nand it evidently had a good memory. He watched wild-eyed as the plant\r\nstruggled to lift its roots from the earth ...\r\n\r\nOne root finally came loose with an audible POP, accompanied by a\r\nsqueaking streak of profanity. Another and another root worked free, and\r\nsuddenly the geranium was standing on the edge of the box. Its bright\r\nred blossom turned from side to side.

There were no eyes visible but\r\nHenderson had the chilly feeling that the flower was surveying the room.\r\nThen, after a moment, the plant jumped to the sill of the window, from\r\nthere to the seat of a chair. Then it slid down one of the legs of the\r\nchair to the floor.\r\n\r\nIt shook its leaves, lifted its blossom upward at the amazed Henderson\r\nfrozen in his chair, and the tiny squeaking voice said cheerily, "Hi,\r\nPal!" Then it started walking across the floor, toward the door,\r\nmuttering, "Somebody\'s got to answer that damned door bell."\r\n\r\nHenderson\'s legs came unfroze as it went through the doorway and he made\r\na wild dash after the walking geranium. It was padding down the hall,\r\nits roots making little patting sounds on the linoleum as he passed it.\r\n\r\nHenderson opened the door, and only then did he begin to realize the\r\nscope his rays must have!\r\n\r\nHe stood, jaws agape, looking down at the rose-bush which stood outside\r\nthe door. His mouth opened and words tried to come out. But the bush\r\nspoke first.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been ringing this bell for hours," it said petulantly. "Some nasty\r\nboys have been picking my roses and I\'m getting sore!"\r\n\r\nHenderson fainted then, and the last thing he remembered was the voice\r\nof the geranium saying:\r\n\r\n"Hi, Babe, come on in.
