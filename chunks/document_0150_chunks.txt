But if he were alive ...\r\n then there was something he had to find._\r\n\r\n\r\nCULLY\r\n\r\nBy JACK EGAN\r\n\r\nIllustrated by SCHELLING\r\n\r\n\r\nAbove him eighty feet of torpid, black water hung like a shroud of\r\nDeath, and still he heard his ragged breathing. And something else.\r\nCully concentrated on that sound, and the rhythmic pulsing of his heart.\r\nSomehow he had to retain a hold on his sanity ... or his soul.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour of careful breathing and exploring of body sensations,\r\nCully realized he could move. He flexed an arm; a mote of gold sand\r\nsifted upward in the dark water. It had a pleasant color, in contrast\r\nwith the ominous shades of the sea. In a few moments, he had struggled\r\nto a sitting position, delighting in the curtain of glittering metal\r\ngrains whirling around him as he moved.\r\n\r\nAnd the other sound. A humming in his mind; a distant burble of tiny\r\nvoices of other minds. Words swirling in giddy patterns he couldn\'t\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\nShortly thereafter, Cully discovered why he still lived, breathed: a\r\nsuit. A yellow, plastic, water-tight suit, with an orange-on-black\r\nshield on the left breast pocket, and a clear bubble-helmet. He felt\r\nweight on his back and examined it: two air tanks and their regulator, a\r\nradio, and ... the box.\r\n\r\nSuit, tanks, regulator; radio, black water, box; sand, sea, stillness.\r\n\r\nCully considered his world. It was small; it was conceivable; it was\r\nincomplete.\r\n\r\n_Where is it?_\r\n\r\n"Where is what?" He knew he had a voice--a means of communication\r\nbetween others of his kind, using low-frequency heat waves caused by\r\nagitation of air molecules. Why couldn\'t he make it work?\r\n\r\nWords. Thousands of them, at his beck and call. What were they? 

=== Chunk 2 ===
What did\r\nthey mean? He shifted uncomfortably in the tight yellow suit, searching\r\nthe near horizon for ...\r\n\r\n_Where is it?_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA vague calling came from beyond the black sea curtain. Objectively,\r\nbecause he could do nothing to stop them, he watched his feet pick up,\r\nmove forward, put down; pick up, move forward, put down. Funny. He had\r\nthe feeling, the concept, that this action held meaning. It was supposed\r\nto cause some reaction, accomplish an act. He wondered at the regular\r\nmovement of his legs. One of them hurt. A hurt is a sensation of pain,\r\ncaused by over-loading sensory-units in the body; a hurt is bad, because\r\nit indicates something is wrong.\r\n\r\nSomething certainly was wrong. Something stirred in Cully\'s mind. He\r\nstopped and sat down on the sandy sea bottom, gracefully, like a ballet\r\ndancer. He examined his foot. There was a tiny hole in the yellow\r\nplastic fabric, and a thin string of red-black was oozing out. Blood. He\r\nknew.\r\n\r\nHe was bleeding. He could do nothing about it. He got up and resumed\r\nwalking.\r\n\r\n_Where is it?_\r\n\r\nCully lifted his head in annoyance at the sharp thought.\r\n\r\n"Go away," he said in a low, pleading voice. The sound made him feel\r\nbetter. He began muttering to himself.\r\n\r\n"Water, black, s-sand, hurt. Pain. Radio tanks ..."\r\n\r\nIt didn\'t sound right. After a few minutes, he was quiet. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
The\r\nmanythoughts were calling him. He must go to the manythoughts.\r\n\r\nIf his foot was bleeding, then something had happened; if something had\r\nhappened, then his foot was bleeding.\r\n\r\n"No!"\r\n\r\nIf something had happened, then maybe other things had happened--before\r\nthat. But how could something happen in a world of flat gold sand and\r\nflaccid sea? Surely there was something wrong. Wrong: the state of being\r\nnot-right; something had happened that was not-right. Cully stared at\r\nthe edges of the unmoving curtain before him.\r\n\r\n_Where is it?_\r\n\r\nIt was a driving, promise-filled concept. No words; just the sense that\r\nsomething wonderful lay just beyond reach. But this voice was different\r\nfrom the manythoughts. It was directing his body; his mind was along for\r\nthe ride.\r\n\r\nThe sameness of the sea and sand became unbearable. It was too-right,\r\nsomehow. Cully felt anger, and kicked up eddies of dust. It changed the\r\nsameness a little. He kicked more up, until it swirled around him in a\r\nthick gold haze, blotting out the terrible emptiness of the sea.\r\n\r\nHe felt another weight at his side. He found a holster and gun. He\r\nrecognized neither. Again he watched objectively as his hand pulled the\r\nblack object out and handled it. His body was evidently familiar with\r\nit, though it was strange to his eyes. His finger slipped automatically\r\ninto the trigger sheaf. His legs were still working under two drives:\r\nthe manythoughts\' urging, and something else, buried in him. A longing.\r\nUp-and-down, back-and-forth.\r\n\r\n_Where is it?_\r\n\r\nAnger, frustration flared in him. His hand shot out, gun at ready. He\r\nturned around slowly. Through the settling trail of suspended sand,\r\nnothing was visible.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAgain he was moving. Something made his legs move. He walked on through\r\nthe shrouds of Death until he felt a taut singing in his nerves. An\r\nirrational fear sprang out in him, cascading down his spine, and Cully\r\nshuddered. Ahead there was some_thing_. Two motives: get there because\r\nit (they?) calls; get there because you must.\r\n\r\n_Where is it?_\r\n\r\nThe mind-voice was excited, demanding. Something was out there,\r\nbesides the sameness. Cully walked on, trailing gold. The death-curtain\r\nparted ...\r\n\r\nAn undulating garden of blue-and-gold streamers suddenly drifted toward\r\nhim on an unfelt current. Cully was held, entranced. They flowed before\r\nhim, their colors dazzling, hypnotic.\r\n\r\n_Come closer, Earthling_, the manythoughts spoke inside his head,\r\nsoothingly.\r\n\r\n_Here it is!_ Cully\'s mind shouted.\r\n\r\nCully\'s mind was held, hypnotized, but his body moved of its own\r\nvolition.\r\n\r\nHe moved again. His mind and the manythoughts\' spoke:\r\nfulfillment--almost. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
There was one action left that must be completed.\r\n\r\nCully\'s arms moved. They detached the small black box from his pack. He\r\nmoved on into the midst of the weaving, gold-laced plants. Little\r\nspicules licked out from their flexing stalks and jabbed, unsensed, into\r\nCully\'s body to draw nourishment. From the manythoughts came the sense\r\nof complete fulfillment.\r\n\r\nFrom Cully\'s mind came further orders.\r\n\r\n_Lie down._ It was a collective concept. _Lie still. We are friends._\r\n\r\nHe could not understand. They were speaking words; words were beyond\r\nhim. His head shook in despair. The voices were implanting an emotion of\r\nhorror at what his hands were doing, but he had no control over his\r\nbody. It was as if it were not his.\r\n\r\nThe black box was now lying in the sand among the streaming plants.\r\nCully\'s fingers reached out and caressed a small panel. A soundless\r\n\'click\' ran through the murkiness. The strangely beautiful, gold-laced\r\nblue plants began a writhing dance. Their spicules withdrew and jabbed,\r\nwithdrew and jabbed. A rending, silent scream tore the quiet waters.\r\n\r\n_NO!_ they cried. It was a negative command, mixed in with the terrible\r\nscreaming. _Turn it off!_\r\n\r\n"Stop it, stop it!" Cully tried to say, but there were no words. He\r\ntried to cover his ears within the helmet, but the cries went on.\r\nEmotions roiled the water: pain, hurt, reproach. Cully sobbed. Something\r\nwas wrong here; something was killing the plants--the beautiful blue\r\nthings! The plants were withering, dying. He looked up at them,\r\nstupefied, not understanding, tears streaming down his face. What did\r\nthey want from him? What had he done ...\r\n\r\n_Where is it?_\r\n\r\nA different direction materialized; a new concept of desire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCully\'s body turned and crawled away from the wonderful, dying garden,\r\noblivious to the pleadings floating, now weakly, in the torpid water. He\r\nscuffed up little motes of golden sand, leaving a low-lying scud along\r\nthe bottom, back to the little black box in the garden. The plants, the\r\nbox, all were forgotten by now. Cully crawled on, not knowing why. A\r\nrise appeared; surprise caught Cully unaware. A change in the sameness!\r\n\r\n_Where is it?_\r\n\r\nAgain the voice was insistent. His desire was close ahead; he did not\r\nlook back at the black churning on the sea bottom. His legs worked, his\r\nchest heaved, words swirled in his mind. He topped the rise.\r\n\r\nBelow him, in the center of a shallow golden bowl, floated a long, shiny\r\ncylinder. Even from here he knew it was huge. He knew other things about\r\nit: how heavy it was; how it was; that it carried others of his kind. He\r\nhad been in it before. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
And they were waiting for him. He lurched on.\r\n\r\n"Captain! Here comes Cully!" the midshipman shouted from the airlock.\r\n"Look what they\'ve done to him!"\r\n\r\nThe old man\'s grey eyes took in the spectacle without visible emotion.\r\nHe watched the pathetic, bleeding yellow plastic sack crawl up to the\r\nship and look up. His hands reached down and lifted Cully up into the\r\nlock.\r\n\r\nThey took his suit off and stared with loathing at what had once been a\r\nman. A white scar zig-zagged across his forehead. The Captain bent\r\nclose, in range of the dim blue eyes.\r\n\r\n"It was a brave thing you did, Cully. The whole system will be grateful.\r\nVenus could never be colonized as long as those cannibals were there to\r\neat men, and drive men mad." Cully fingered the scar on his forehead,\r\nand looked unseeing into the old man\'s compassionate eyes. "I\'m sorry\r\nCully. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
We all are. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
But there was no other way. Prefrontal lobotomy,\r\ndestruction of your speech center ... it was the only way you could get\r\npast the telepaths and destroy them. I\'m sorry, Cully. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
The race of Man\r\nshall long honor your name."\r\n\r\nCully smiled at the old man, the words churning in his brain; but he did\r\nnot understand.\r\n\r\n_Where is it?_\r\n\r\nThe emptiness was still there.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ January 1963.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.
