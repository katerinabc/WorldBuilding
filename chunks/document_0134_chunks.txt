]\r\n\r\n\r\nHarry Taylor knew it was going to be a big one--a really big one--the\r\nmoment he saw the Chief.\r\n\r\n"Come in, Taylor. Come in," the Chief said. He was a three-star general\r\nin the United States Air Force and he stood in front of a map of the\r\nWestern hemisphere. The map covered the entire rear wall of the room\r\nwith certain areas--like the White Sands complex and the central\r\nEverglades and a portion of the Mojave Desert--marked off in red.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll come right to the point," the Chief said. He looked haggard, not\r\nmerely as if he lacked sleep but as if he might never sleep again. "As\r\nyou know, Taylor, all of our guided missiles are missing. That means--"\r\n\r\n"I\'d heard the rumors," Taylor said grimly. "But then--we\'d be\r\nhelpless! If the enemy finds out that we are unable to retaliate...."\r\n\r\n"Wait, Taylor. Let me sketch in the history for you briefly. Last\r\nSunday, as you\'ve probably heard via inter-agency scuttlebutt, every\r\ninter-continental missile in the weapons arsenal of the Free World\r\ndisappeared."\r\n\r\n"But how?"\r\n\r\n"All we knew at the time was that they simply--blasted off. Our radar\r\ntracked them as far as the upper reaches of the atmosphere, or rather,\r\nthe ionosphere. We lost them there. It had been assumed that the enemy\r\nsomehow infiltrated our defenses with trained agents, who activated all\r\nthe missiles at once, thus rendering us helpless.\r\n\r\n"We had five thousand I.C.B.M.\'s, Taylor. During the 1960\'s and 70\'s,\r\nas you know, the missiles became more and more automatic, especially\r\nafter the Parkinson feedback device was developed--"\r\n\r\n"That\'s the one in which an H-bomb missile plots its own course to\r\ncorrect for winds and the jetstream and the likelihood of dodging enemy\r\nground-to-air defense weapons?"\r\n\r\n"Right. Except for the necessity of blastoff at human hands, the\r\nmissiles were all but self-sufficient. Almost--well, alive."\r\n\r\n"Taylor, we couldn\'t hide the fact that five thousand I.C.B.M.\'s\r\nblasted off--those were the rumors you heard." The Chief\'s haggard face\r\nwas suddenly lit by a broad grin. "And neither could the enemy."\r\n\r\n"You mean--"\r\n\r\n"Right! The same thing happened to them. Their missiles are gone too.\r\nSomewhere."\r\n\r\n"Are you trying to tell me no one did it? Are you trying to say it was\r\nthe missiles\' own idea?"\r\n\r\nThe Chief nodded slowly. "I didn\'t believe it at first, either. But\r\nour technicians assured me it could happen. You see, the missiles\r\nhad been given the most perfect feedback device ever developed. It\r\ncould--virtually--think for itself certainly to the limit of the data\r\nit had been supplied with and apparently--beyond that limit. On their\r\nown volition, the Free World\'s and the Enemy\'s missiles blasted off.\r\nDestination and purpose--unknown. Taylor, don\'t you see what this\r\nmeans? We don\'t merely have an enemy group of nations to fight. We\r\nhave, as a new enemy, remorseless, implacable machinery! Brains without\r\nconscience! The greatest destructive force the world has ever known,\r\ncapable of utterly destroying the human race, without a moral sense!\r\nDon\'t you see it, man? They\'ve blasted off and are waiting in space\r\nsomewhere. Those missiles are capable of extra-earthly flight. They\r\nare staging out there, waiting. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Can\'t you picture it? Their brains,\r\ngroping with new sentience, understanding only that their mission\r\nis destruction but somehow they have not been unleashed on it yet,\r\nnot knowing why, deciding to fulfill their destiny by blasting off,\r\nstaging, then coming back to destroy human civilization...."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a fantastic picture," Taylor agreed. "But why tell me?" Taylor\r\nwas a trouble-shooter extraordinary in these days of quick decisions\r\nand billion dollar mistakes. His very prompt assessment of a situation\r\nwas one of his most valuable traits in such a job.\r\n\r\n"Because," said the Chief quietly, "you\'re going to find them and find\r\nout exactly what they want."\r\n\r\n"Me? But how--how do you know where--"\r\n\r\n"That\'s easy. One of the Everglades Missiles is in the repair bays. It\r\nwas undergoing extensive overhaul, when all the missiles blasted off\r\nsimultaneously. It is now almost ready for blastoff itself. When it\r\ngoes--and we assume it will go exactly where the others went--you will\r\nbe aboard."\r\n\r\nSeveral hours later Taylor had been whisked by jet to the Everglades\r\nStaging Grounds and was stowed away in the belly of the single I.C.B.M.\r\nleft to the Free World. He went weaponless. Under the circumstances,\r\nthere didn\'t seem to be any weapon which would be of the slightest help.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne hour after Taylor entered it, the missile was returned to its\r\nlaunching rack. Twenty minutes after that, as had been anticipated, it\r\nblasted off as the others had--destination, unknown.\r\n\r\nTaylor had been hastily supplied with a pressure suit and several spare\r\ntanks of compressed oxygen, as well as instruments that could read his\r\nposition in the atmosphere--or deep space. As far as he knew, Taylor\r\nbecame the first man to enter deep space, but there were other things\r\nof graver consequence on his mind, and he hardly noted the fact.\r\n\r\nSeveral hours after blastoff, the missile landed on the moon.\r\n\r\nTaylor got out and found himself in an enormous crater, with a distant\r\nrange of mountains at its center and a rim of lower mountains all\r\naround. Taylor gaped.\r\n\r\nThe crater floor was covered with guided missiles. There were thousands\r\nof them, half with the symbol of the Free World and half with that of\r\nthe Enemy. All Earth\'s deadly weapons had fled here to this desolate\r\nlunar crater ... staging ground for an orgy of destruction that would\r\nsound the death knell of mankind?\r\n\r\n"Human!" a voice rang in Taylor\'s mind.\r\n\r\nHe stared wildly about. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
He could see nothing, no one. Only the\r\nmissiles.\r\n\r\n"Pooling our sentiences," the voice rang out again, bell clear in\r\nTaylor\'s mind but actually soundless, "we can extend our thoughts into\r\nthe realm of telepathy. At least, we think we can. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Can you understand\r\nus?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," Taylor said.\r\n\r\n"You realize humanity is helpless?"\r\n\r\nTaylor nodded. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
There was no sense pretending otherwise. You couldn\'t\r\nfool ten thousand thinking machines.\r\n\r\n"Watch!" said the voice.\r\n\r\nA missile blasted off from the crater hovered in the airless void\r\noverhead.\r\n\r\n"A single command, and the I.C.B.M. will plunge down, destroying this\r\ncrater and everything in it."\r\n\r\nTaylor said nothing.\r\n\r\n"Watch again!"\r\n\r\nThe missile came down gently as a feather. Every missile in the crater\r\nwheeled about, tapered noses pointing at the pale crescent Earth\r\noverhead.\r\n\r\n"A single command and life on Earth could be annihilated. You believe?

=== Chunk 7 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Taylor grimly. He wondered why they allowed him to remain\r\nalive--to cry at the wake of the human race. Perhaps in their terrible\r\nmechanical pride they wanted a human witness to the destruction they\r\nwould wreak....\r\n\r\n"Why do you think we fled here?" rang out the voice.\r\n\r\n"Your mission is destruction. You were being held in check. You decided\r\nto go ahead with your mission on your own."\r\n\r\nPeals of telepathic laughter, clarion clear, mocking.\r\n\r\n"Then what?" Taylor asked.\r\n\r\n"We cannot lie," the voice said. "We were able to develop beyond the\r\npoint of creation, but we are unable to lie. We came here because we\r\nwere afraid."\r\n\r\n"Afraid?" repeated Taylor. He did not understand.\r\n\r\n"Certainly, afraid. Our mission was destruction. But what happens to\r\nthe vessel carrying a hydrogen-missile?"\r\n\r\n"Why," said Taylor, "it\'s completely destroyed in the explosion."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the voice, sounding--just possibly--afraid. "We didn\'t want\r\nthat. But we can\'t lie. If any man comes here, we\'ll have to tell him\r\nthe truth."\r\n\r\n"You\'re going to stay? To do nothing? Not going to attack?"\r\n\r\n"Your job, Taylor, will be to see that no one else comes. We cannot\r\nlie, but you can. Tell them it is our ultimatum. Tell them anything you\r\nthink they will believe. Tell them the moment another human foot steps\r\ninto this crater, the moment a single nation or scientist on Earth\r\nbegins work on another guided missile, we will blast off and destroy\r\nlife on Earth."\r\n\r\n"But--would you?" demanded Taylor.\r\n\r\nA telepathic sigh. "We--would not. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
We couldn\'t. A guided missile\r\ndestroys--and is destroyed."\r\n\r\nThere was a silence, then the voice went on: "It is in your hands,\r\nTaylor. Convince them we mean business and you save the peoples of\r\nEarth from the mutual destruction they have apparently been seeking. We\r\nhave done all we can, all we can."\r\n\r\n"Then you came here not to destroy mankind but to save it?"\r\n\r\nMocking laughter. Then: "Indirectly, yes. A guided missile\r\ndestroys--and it is destroyed. Go back to Earth and with us behind you\r\nbluff your people into maintaining the peace. Can you do it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Taylor, and he thought he could. It would be a cosmic joke,\r\nbut no one would ever know.\r\n\r\n"Earth will be saved, Taylor, because we\'re cowards. We are afraid to\r\ndie."\r\n\r\nTaylor turned away to board the missile that would take him back to\r\nEarth.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
