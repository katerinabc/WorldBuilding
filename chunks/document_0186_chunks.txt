But Endicott\r\n                         remembered about the\r\n                       old, old days--when a man\r\n                      could save a life without a\r\n                          push-button...._\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n               Worlds of If Science Fiction, March 1955.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nStiff fingers of icy, wind-driven snow beat a tattoo on the hull of the\r\ncargo ship, filtered through the jagged tears in the metal skin, sifted\r\ndown over the useless control board with its dead gauges and bank upon\r\nbank of pushbuttons. Amidship, a wind-thrashed branch screechingly\r\nscraped the reverberating hull, and the sound, like the rasp of sliding\r\nhatch covers, echoed through the ship.\r\n\r\nDazedly, Allison watched the sifting snow settle on the buttons, each\r\none acquiring a grotesque, lop-sided, conical hat which grew as he\r\nstared. He reached forward an already stiffening finger and brushed one\r\nof the hats away, and almost idly watched another one form in its place.\r\n\r\n"Come on, Allison, come on. Snap out of it." Endicott came out of the\r\npassageway into the control room, returned from his inspection of the\r\nmachinery. "You hurt in the landing?"\r\n\r\nAllison didn\'t answer. He shivered and pushed another inquisitive\r\nfinger at the control board; the finger selected a certain button and\r\npushed it steadily. There was no click of a hidden relay, no whir of\r\nlittle motors springing to life.\r\n\r\n"You can punch that button or any of the others from now until--It\r\nwon\'t do any good. We\'re dead." The plume of Endicott\'s frozen breath\r\ndrifted over Allison\'s shoulder, merged with the sifting snow.\r\n\r\n"Dead?" Allison echoed in a sleepwalker\'s voice. "Dead," he repeated\r\nand jabbed the button again and again.\r\n\r\n"In a manner of speaking," Endicott\'s white-sandy brows drew together\r\nin a frown. "We\'re off the powercast--our receiver, I guess."\r\n\r\n"No power." Allison was following better, was waking up. "That\r\nmeans--Can\'t you fix it, Chief?"\r\n\r\n"Nope. I tried, but something in its guts is burned out. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
No power."\r\nEndicott beat his old blue-veined hands together.\r\n\r\nAllison\'s frost-numbed fingers picked at the straps on his reclining\r\ngeeseat, and he stepped to the light metal deck. He shivered and\r\npunched the button on the control board again. He was seized by a spasm\r\nof uncontrollable shaking. "No power means--no heat!" Panic crept into\r\nhis voice.\r\n\r\nEndicott said nothing but looked at the tier upon tier of buttons,\r\nfunctionless now.\r\n\r\nAllison looked at the board, too, his narrow shoulders hunched.\r\n"They\'ve never failed before," he muttered through chattering teeth.\r\n\r\n"What?" Endicott seemed bemused.\r\n\r\n"The buttons. Punch \'em, and you always get what you want--except now!"\r\n\r\n"Now, now," Endicott said soothingly. "Panic isn\'t going to help us\r\nany. All we have to do is sit tight--and wait. They\'ll send a relief\r\nship out--"\r\n\r\n"When?"\r\n\r\n"In the morning. Morning, sure. They had us on the \'viewer, don\'t\r\nforget. They\'ll know exactly where to look."\r\n\r\n"They won\'t be able to locate us in this white stuff."\r\n\r\n"I tell you they know precisely where we are. And anyway the scanviewer\r\nwill pick us up."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think they\'ll ever find us." Allison slumped down on his\r\ntransverse geeseat, stared wide-eyed at the drift forming slowly inside\r\nthe torn metal of the windward side of the control room. "This white\r\nstuff scares me." He shivered, then got up hastily, his boots slipping\r\nslightly on the snow-slick decking, and punched the button again. "It\'s\r\ngot to work!" he cried and beat on the board with his fist.\r\n\r\n"Stop that!" Endicott said sharply.\r\n\r\nThere was a crack of a slap in the control room, then silence.\r\n\r\nIn a moment Endicott said in his soothing voice, "Sorry, Allison.\r\nEverything\'ll be all right. Don\'t you worry."\r\n\r\n"If you say so, Chief." Allison stood in the center of the control\r\nroom, his arms slack by his sides.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll be all right," Endicott said. "We have food capsules--"\r\n\r\n"Sure, Chief."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll be all right, except--" Endicott peered through the rents in the\r\nhull into the storm outside. "All we have to do is sit tight," he added\r\nhastily.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll freeze tonight without heat." Allison\'s voice was still\r\nbreathless with panic.\r\n\r\n"Yeah. Yeah, I\'ve been thinking about that. There\'s some thing\r\n\'way down deep in my mind--something I can\'t quite get--" Endicott\r\nstill looked out at the storm-thrashed trees, a puzzled expression\r\nwrinkling his face. "Something from my childhood--I was born a long\r\ntime before you, you know, before they set up state conditioning homes\r\nfor children. Long before they set up this \'everything-from-buttons\'\r\nbusiness. Lived with my own people, I did, and I seem to remember--seem\r\nto remember--" The puzzled expression became a frown of concentration.\r\n"Or maybe it was something I read a long time ago," he mused.\r\n\r\n"Did what?" Allison perked up.\r\n\r\n"Read. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
You wouldn\'t know what that was. Everything comes from buttons\r\nnow, entertainment, food, light, heat--everything.... No, it was from\r\nmy childhood, I\'m sure. I remember my people used to take me out in\r\nthe country--" Endicott mused on while a cloak of snow grew on the\r\nshoulders of his jacket, and the light began to fade.\r\n\r\n"Out in the country? What for? 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Nobody goes out there." Allison\'s eyes\r\ngleamed slightly in the growing dusk.\r\n\r\n"--for picnics. And--" Endicott\'s eyes brightened, and one hand\r\nclenched.\r\n\r\n"For what?" Allison\'s head thrust forward.\r\n\r\n"What?" Endicott snapped, irritated at having his train of thought\r\nbroken.\r\n\r\n"What did your people take you in the country for?"\r\n\r\n"A picnic.... Yes, yes, that\'s it! I remember now!" Endicott\'s words\r\npoured out.\r\n\r\n"You know it is forbidden to think of the old days."\r\n\r\n"Shut up! 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Let me think. You want heat, don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s forbidden to think of the old days," Allison repeated stubbornly.\r\n"You\'ll get heat when I report this--in a different way."\r\n\r\n"Shut up! Look, you want to keep from freezing tonight?" Endicott\r\nglared. "All right. Come with me and do as I say." Without a backward\r\nglance Endicott crossed the slippery deck and entered the passageway.\r\nAt the midship cargo natch he stopped.\r\n\r\n"How are you going to open it without power?" Allison\'s breath-plume\r\nshot over Endicott\'s shoulder. "It\'s locked and unlocked by a button on\r\nthe control board. Remember Chief?"\r\n\r\n"Stop gloating, Allison. This is for your benefit as well as mine.\r\nThere\'s an escape hatch in the control room."\r\n\r\n"That\'s controlled by power, too."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but in these older models the hatch also has a manual control, as\r\nI remember." Endicott moved off toward the control room.\r\n\r\nAllison hesitated, then followed, and joined Endicott as he began to\r\nsearch the control board. Endicott found the emergency lever for the\r\nescape hatch and tugged on it, turning his head to watch the hatch\r\nin the side of the hull, back of his seat. The hatch, big enough for\r\none man to pass through at a time, popped, crackling with frost, and\r\nstirred slightly.\r\n\r\n"Now, Allison, my boy, let\'s put our shoulders to it." Endicott was in\r\nhigh spirits again.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the hatch swung open, Endicott put his head and shoulders\r\nthrough the opening, squinting his eyes against the icy snow which\r\nswirled past him. He grabbed a handhold on the outside of the hull and\r\npulled his legs through, and dropped into the snow alongside the ship.\r\n\r\nAllison\'s head and shoulders appeared in the opening, and in a moment\r\nhe was beside Endicott. "Now what?" Allison yelled above the wind.\r\n\r\nEndicott looked toward the clearing in which they had landed, then\r\nturned to face the trees around the disabled ship. He waded through the\r\nsnow to the nearest one and reflectively took hold of a dry branch over\r\nhis head, tugged it several times as though judging its resiliency,\r\nbefore snapping it off.\r\n\r\n"Now, Allison, you see what I did? Well, you do the same, only gather\r\nan armload of branches. When you have them, bring them to me at the\r\nship. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
And keep on gathering them until I tell you to stop."\r\n\r\nAllison stood still in the deep snow, peering suspiciously at Endicott\r\nthrough the snow-swirl. "Is this something from the old--?"\r\n\r\n"Never mind that now, Allison," Endicott said patiently. "Let\'s not\r\nworry about all that twaddle. You want to be warm, don\'t you? So, just\r\ndo as I say."\r\n\r\nAllison\'s eyebrows shot up and lowered instantly, and his face set in\r\nstubborn planes. "If this is from the old days I\'m not sure I want any\r\npart of it." He looked furtively over his shoulders at the gloomy woods.\r\n\r\n"There are no Conditioning Committees here, Allison," Endicott said\r\ntestily. "Get on with it."\r\n\r\nAllison took a few reluctant steps toward the nearest tree. Endicott\r\nstarted back to the ship with his branch, looking back over his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n"No, no, Allison. See those green needles? It won\'t do at all.\r\nDry branches, Allison, _dry_ branches." The whipping wind carried\r\nEndicott\'s words over the few yards.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t see how these--branches?--are going to keep us warm. It seems\r\nlike a lot of useless trouble getting them," Allison said sulkily,\r\nsuspicion and fear unabated.\r\n\r\nEndicott didn\'t answer. Instead, he went to the side of the ship away\r\nfrom the wind and began tramping the snow down into a flat, hard\r\nfloor. He broke his branch into short lengths over his knee, then, in\r\na nearly forgotten gesture, slapped at his uniform until he remembered\r\nthat he had no pockets. For a moment he stood still, his eyes roving\r\nover the side of the ship until it came to one of the jagged tears.\r\nWith a little self-congratulatory chuckle, he began scraping one of\r\nthe lengths of wood over the torn metal, catching the splinters and\r\nshavings in the palm of one hand.\r\n\r\nAllison dropped his armload of branches by the ship, waged an inner\r\nbattle between fear of the unknown and curiosity in which curiosity\r\nwon, and stood watching Endicott arrange the branches in a crib around\r\nthe neatly piled shavings. Endicott, on one knee by the crib, worked\r\nsteadily, laying the pieces of wood with care and a returning sense\r\nof sureness, with only brief pauses to flex his freezing fingers.\r\nFinally, with a smile of satisfaction on his face, Endicott got to his\r\nfeet, and the nearly forgotten gesture at the pocketless uniform was\r\nrepeated.\r\n\r\nSlowly, Endicott\'s lined face altered. He looked hastily at the\r\nwatchful Allison and hastily looked away; he looked at the completed\r\ncrib, and his tongue licked his lips; he looked along the side of the\r\ndamaged ship, and his eyes narrowed thoughtfully; finally, he looked\r\ninto the swirl of the icy snow, and he shivered. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
His hands ceased their\r\npawing, fell slowly, to hang slack by his sides. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
He was not smiling as\r\nhe turned away.\r\n\r\n"What were you looking for?" Allison asked curiously.\r\n\r\n"I just remembered something else," said Endicott, his voice was very\r\nsoft in the stillness, "we used to have something called a match to\r\nstart those picnic fires."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
