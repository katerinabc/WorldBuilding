]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe could remember the afternoon as if it were yesterday. It wasn\'t, of\r\ncourse--actually it had been several years back. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
It had been around the\r\nmiddle of autumn, about the time when the last incarnadine leaves were\r\nmaking their fluttering journeys earthward. He had taken his .22 and\r\ngone into the woods where the hickory trees were, and he had settled\r\nhimself comfortably against the shaggy trunk of one of the hickories,\r\nthe .22 balanced across his sprawled knees. Then he had waited.\r\n\r\nThe first red squirrel had come out on one of the high limbs and posed\r\nthere. That was the word all right--posed. It had sat there on its\r\nhaunches with utter immobility almost as if it had been painted on\r\ncanvas against a background of leafless naked branches and milk-blue\r\nsky.\r\n\r\nHe had raised the .22 lazily and sighted along the slender barrel.\r\nThere was no hurry. There was all the time in the world. He didn\'t\r\nsqueeze the trigger until he had a perfect right-between-the-eyes bead,\r\nthen he squeezed it ever so lightly. There was the sharp sound of the\r\nreport, and then the small body falling swiftly, bouncing and glancing\r\noff limbs, tumbling over and over, making a rustling thump in the dry\r\nleaves at the tree\'s base.\r\n\r\nHe hadn\'t even bothered to go over and examine it. He knew he\'d got it\r\nright where he\'d aimed. They didn\'t die instantly like that unless you\r\ngot them in a vital spot. They thrashed and kicked around after they\r\nhit the ground and sometimes you had to waste another shell on them if\r\nthe noise bothered you. Of course if the noise didn\'t bother you, you\r\ncould save the shell for the next one, but it was better in the long\r\nrun to get them right between the eyes because that way the others\r\nwouldn\'t be frightened away by the thrashing sound, and you didn\'t have\r\nto get up.\r\n\r\nThat had been the first one.\r\n\r\nThe second one had been coming down the trunk of the same tree,\r\nspiraling the trunk, the way squirrels do, stopping at frequent\r\nintervals and studying their surroundings with their bright beebees of\r\neyes, looking right at you sometimes but never seeing you unless you\r\nmoved. This one had stopped, head down, and was looking off to one side\r\nwhen he got it. The force of the bullet, striking just below the ear,\r\nwhere he\'d aimed, tore the small red body right off the trunk, spun it\r\naround several times, and dropped it into a wild blackberry thicket.\r\n\r\nHe hadn\'t bothered to look at that one either. He had lit a cigarette\r\nand leaned back more comfortably against the hickory. It was a pleasant\r\nafternoon, mild for November--a time for wandering in woods, a time\r\nto take it a little easy, a time to knock off some of the scavengers\r\nand pests you\'d neglected during the first days of pheasant and rabbit\r\nseason, a time to get your eyes down to hair-line fineness for the\r\nfirst ecstatic day of deer. Red squirrels were easy, of course, a\r\nlittle beneath the dignity of a true hunter, but when you tried to bore\r\nthem in vital spots you got some pretty good practice out of it.\r\n\r\nHe yawned. Then, out of the corner of his eye, he caught a red wisp\r\nof movement high in the tree to his right. He brought the .22 over\r\ncasually. He hardly needed to turn his body at all. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
The stock fitted\r\nhis shoulder snugly, lay cool against his cheek. There was no recoil,\r\nonly the sharp ripping sound, and then the dark red body falling,\r\nhitting limbs, caroming, dropping, dropping, making the familiar\r\nthrilling rustling sound in the dead leaves.\r\n\r\nThat had been the third.\r\n\r\nThe fourth and the fifth had been about the same.\r\n\r\nAfter the fifth, he had become a little bored. He decided to vary the\r\ngame a little. He drew his knees together and rested the barrel of the\r\n.22 in the niche between them, then sat there quietly for a long time.\r\n\r\nPresently the sixth squirrel left the security of the trees and made\r\na few quick jumps into the small clearing. Then it stopped and stood\r\npoised, a statuette except for its alive bright eyes. It was a perfect\r\ntarget, but he was in no hurry. He was enjoying himself immensely.\r\n\r\nAfter about half a minute the squirrel moved again--several yards\r\ncloser, almost in an exact line with the dark little eye of the .22. It\r\nsat up on its haunches then, its tail an arched question mark behind\r\nit. It put its tiny forepaws together and sat there not moving, almost\r\nas though it were praying. (That was the part he remembered most\r\nvividly.)\r\n\r\nHe\'d hardly needed to move the .22 at all. The slightest shift had\r\naligned the sights with the imaginary mark between the little eyes. He\r\nhad squeezed the trigger nonchalantly, and the part of the head just\r\nabove the eyes had come right off and the small red body had completed\r\na perfect somersault before dropping into the dead leaves of the\r\nclearing.\r\n\r\nAfter that he hadn\'t bothered with the trees. It was so much more fun\r\nin the clearing, waiting for them to come right up to you and pose. Of\r\ncourse it wasn\'t such good practice, but it was fine entertainment--an\r\nideal way to spend a lazy afternoon in fall when the wood was all cut\r\nfor winter, the crops in, the barn roof repaired and Pa off to town\r\nwhere he couldn\'t be finding annoying little things for you to do.\r\n\r\nHe had got eleven of them altogether, he hadn\'t missed a one, and he\r\nhad felt pretty proud taking them home to show to Ma before feeding\r\nthem to the dogs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe shifted his cramped legs and peered down through the interstices of\r\nthe foliage at the gray shape of the hunter. Some of his initial terror\r\nhad left him when he\'d finally realized that they couldn\'t see through\r\nleaves any more than he could; that They, as well as he, needed an open\r\ntarget in order to make a kill.\r\n\r\nSo he was relatively safe in the tree--for a while, at least. Perhaps\r\nhe could find safety in trees for the rest of his life. Trees might be\r\nthe answer.\r\n\r\nHe felt a little better. A portion of the fear that had followed the\r\nmeteor shower was still with him, however. The fear that had detonated\r\nin his mind the morning after the shower when Pa had come running to\r\nthe barn, shouting: "The cities! All the cities have been blowed up!\r\nThey ain\'t no more cities in the whole world. Radio just said so \'fore\r\nit went dead. We\'re bein\' invaded!"\r\n\r\n_Invaded?_ Invaded by whom? He hadn\'t been able to grasp it at first.\r\nAt first he\'d thought Russia, and then he\'d thought, no, it couldn\'t\r\nbe Russia. Pa had said _all_ the cities. All the cities in the whole\r\nwide world.\r\n\r\nAnd then he\'d begun to see the people on the road. The terrified\r\npeople, the walking, running, stumbling people heading for the\r\nhills--the hills and the forests, the hiding places that ships couldn\'t\r\nsee, that bombs couldn\'t find.\r\n\r\nBut that hunters could.\r\n\r\nHunters hunting with incredible silver guns, skimming along the roads\r\nto the hills and the forests in fantastic vehicles, alighting by\r\nroadsides and lumbering across fields to timber stands; routing out\r\nthe people from elms and oaks and maples and locusts and even sumac,\r\nflushing them out like rabbits and shooting them down in cold blood\r\nwith blinding shards of bullets.\r\n\r\nHe had run when he\'d seen the first vehicle. He\'d run wildly for the\r\nwoods. He\'d forgotten Pa and Ma. He\'d even forgotten his gun. He\'d been\r\nscared. Crazy-scared.\r\n\r\nWhat did They want to kill people for? What was wrong with people?\r\n\r\nHe shivered on the limb, in the chill morning wind that had sprung\r\nup after the first frost of the season. Martians, he\'d bet. Martians\r\nlanding on Earth and wanting everything for Themselves, afraid to let\r\npeople live for fear _they\'d_ get some. Greedy Martians, trying to hog\r\nthe whole world!\r\n\r\nThe gray shape below him moved slightly and his terror broke out\r\nafresh. The hunter appeared to be reclining against the trunk of a\r\nnearby tree, its gleaming weapon resting on its huge tentacular legs.\r\nWaiting. For an irrational moment he considered climbing down and\r\napproaching it, getting down on his knees and begging it for mercy.\r\n\r\nBut he\'d only be wasting his time. He realized that right away. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
He knew\r\nhe\'d see no pity in those cold inhuman eyes. He knew he\'d see nothing\r\nbut death.\r\n\r\nThe trees were the only answer. The trees with their friendly screens\r\nof foliage, their lofty leafy hiding places. By living in the trees\r\na shrewd man might be able to elude the hunters forever. If he was\r\ncareful. If he never let himself be seen.\r\n\r\nHe peered cautiously down at the hunter again. He looked at the gray\r\npatches of the gargantuan body that showed through the interstices of\r\nthe foliage.\r\n\r\nAs he watched, the first frost-nipped leaf fluttered down past his\r\nface, hovering for a moment before his eyes so that he could not miss\r\nits new autumnal coloring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
