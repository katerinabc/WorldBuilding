On the upper, or stem\r\nend of the vessel, a translucent pink panel popped up and a slender,\r\ngraceful form not unlike a large violet caterpillar undulated into\r\nview.\r\n\r\nJudge Gates whirled to the telephone. Half an hour later, he put it to\r\nthe officials gathered with him in a tight group on the lawn.\r\n\r\n"Boys, this thing is intelligent; any fool can see that. It\'s putting\r\ntogether what my boy assures me is some kind of talking machine, and\r\nany minute now it\'s going to start communicating. It\'s been twenty\r\nminutes since I notified Washington on this thing. It won\'t be long\r\nbefore somebody back there decides this is top secret and slaps a\r\nfreeze on us here that will make the Manhattan Project look like a\r\npublicity campaign. Now, I say this is the biggest thing that ever\r\nhappened to Plum County--but if we don\'t aim to be put right out of the\r\npicture, we\'d better move fast."\r\n\r\n"What you got in mind, Jedge?"\r\n\r\n"I propose we hold an open hearing right here in the courthouse,\r\nthe minute that thing gets its gear to working. We\'ll put it on the\r\nair--Tom Clembers from the radio station\'s already stringing wires,\r\nI see. Too bad we\'ve got no TV equipment, but Jody Hurd has a movie\r\ncamera. We\'ll put Willow Grove on the map bigger\'n Cape Canaveral ever\r\nwas."\r\n\r\n"We\'re with you on that, Carter!"\r\n\r\nTen minutes after the melodious voice of the Fianna\'s translator had\r\nrequested escort to the village headman, the visitor was looking over\r\nthe crowded courtroom with an expression reminiscent of a St. Bernard\r\npuppy hoping for a romp. The rustle of feet and throat-clearing\r\nsubsided and the speaker began:\r\n\r\n"People of the Green World, happy the cycle--"\r\n\r\nHeads turned at the clump of feet coming down the side aisle; a\r\nheavy-torsoed man of middle age, bald, wearing a khaki shirt and\r\ntrousers and rimless glasses and with a dark leather holster slapping\r\nhis hip at each step, cleared the end of the front row of seats,\r\nplanted himself, feet apart, yanked a heavy nickel-plated .44 revolver\r\nfrom the holster, took aim and fired five shots into the body of the\r\nFianna at a range of ten feet.\r\n\r\nThe violet form whipped convulsively, writhed from the bench to the\r\nfloor with a sound like a wet fire hose being dropped, uttered a\r\ngasping twitter, and lay still. The gunman turned, dropped the pistol,\r\nthrew up his hands, and called:\r\n\r\n"Sheriff Hoskins, I\'m puttin\' myself in yer pertective custody."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of stunned silence; then a rush of spectators for\r\nthe alien. The sheriff\'s three-hundred-and-nine-pound bulk bellied\r\nthrough the shouting mob to take up a stand before the khaki-clad man.\r\n\r\n"I always knew you was a mean one, Cecil Stump," he said, unlimbering\r\nhandcuffs, "ever since I seen you makin\' up them ground-glass baits for\r\nJoe Potter\'s dog. But I never thought I\'d see you turn to cold-blooded\r\nmurder." He waved at the bystanders. "Clear a path through here; I\'m\r\ntakin\' my prisoner over to the jail."\r\n\r\n"Jest a dad-blamed minute, Sheriff." Stump\'s face was pale, his\r\nglasses were gone and one khaki shoulder strap dangled--but what was\r\nalmost a grin twisted one meaty cheek. He hid his hands behind his\r\nback, leaned away from the cuffs. "I don\'t like that word \'prisoner\'.\r\nI ast you fer pertection. And better look out who you go throwin\' that\r\nword \'murder\' off at, too. I ain\'t murdered nobody."\r\n\r\nThe sheriff blinked, turned to roar, "How\'s the victim, Doc?"\r\n\r\nA small gray head rose from bending over the limp form of the Fianna.\r\n"Deader\'n a mackerel, Sheriff."\r\n\r\n"I guess that\'s it. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
Let\'s go, Cecil."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the charge?"\r\n\r\n"First degree murder."\r\n\r\n"Who\'d I murder?"\r\n\r\n"Why, you killed this here ... this stranger."\r\n\r\n"That ain\'t no stranger. That\'s a varmint. Murder\'s got to do with\r\nkillin\' humerns, way I understand it. You goin\' to tell me that thing\'s\r\nhumern?"\r\n\r\nTen people shouted at once:\r\n\r\n"--human as I am!"\r\n\r\n"--intelligent being!"\r\n\r\n"--tell me you can simply kill--"\r\n\r\n"--must be some kind of law--"\r\n\r\nThe sheriff raised his hands, his jowls drawn down in a scowl. "What\r\nabout it, Judge Gates? Any law against Cecil Stump killing the ...\r\nuh...?"\r\n\r\nThe judge thrust out his lower lip. "Well, let\'s see," he began.\r\n"Technically--"\r\n\r\n"Good Lord!" 

=== Chunk 3 ===
someone blurted. "You mean the laws on murder don\'t define\r\nwhat constitutes--I mean, what--"\r\n\r\n"What a humern is?" Stump snorted. "Whatever it says, it sure-bob don\'t\r\ninclude no purple worms. That\'s a varmint, pure and simple. Ain\'t no\r\ndifferent killin\' it than any other critter."\r\n\r\n"Then, by God, we\'ll get him for malicious damage," a man called. "Or\r\nhunting without a license--out of season!"\r\n\r\n"--carrying concealed weapons!"\r\n\r\nStump went for his hip pocket, fumbled out a fat, shapeless wallet,\r\nextracted a thumbed rectangle of folded paper, offered it.\r\n\r\n"I\'m a licensed exterminator. Got a permit to carry the gun, too.\r\nI ain\'t broken no law." He grinned openly now. "Jest doin\' my job,\r\nSheriff. And at no charge to the county."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA smaller man with bristly red hair flared his nostrils at Stump.\r\n"You blood-thirsty idiot!" He raised a fist and shook it. "We\'ll be\r\na national disgrace--worse than Little Rock! Lynching\'s too good for\r\nyou!"\r\n\r\n"Hold on there, Weinstein," the sheriff cut in. "Let\'s not go gettin\'\r\nno lynch talk started."\r\n\r\n"Lynch, is it!" Cecil Stump bellowed, his face suddenly red. "Why, I\r\ndone a favor for every man here! Now you listen to me! 

=== Chunk 4 ===
What is that\r\nthing over there?" He jerked a blunt thumb toward the judicial bench.\r\n"It\'s some kind of critter from Mars or someplace--you know that as\r\nwell as me! And what\'s it here for? 

=== Chunk 5 ===
It ain\'t for the good of the likes\r\nof you and me, I can tell you that. It\'s them or us. And this time, by\r\nGod, we got in the first lick!"\r\n\r\n"Why you ... you ... hate-monger!"\r\n\r\n"Now, hold on right there. I\'m as liberal-minded as the next feller.\r\nHell, I like a nigger--and I can\'t hardly tell a Jew from a white man.\r\nBut when it comes to takin\' in a damned purple worm and callin\' it\r\nhumern--that\'s where I draw the line."\r\n\r\nSheriff Hoskins pushed between Stump and the surging front rank of the\r\ncrowd. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
"Stay back there! I want you to disperse, peaceably, and let the\r\nlaw handle this."\r\n\r\n"I reckon I\'ll push off now, Sheriff," Stump hitched up his belt.\r\n"I figgered you might have to calm \'em down right at first, but\r\nnow they\'ve had a chance to think it over and see I ain\'t broken\r\nno law, ain\'t none of these law-abiding folks going to do anything\r\nillegal--like tryin\' to get rough with a licensed exterminator just\r\ndoin\' his job." He stooped, retrieved his gun.\r\n\r\n"Here, I\'ll take that," Sheriff Hoskins said. "You can consider your\r\ngun license canceled--and your exterminatin\' license, too."\r\n\r\nStump grinned again, handed the revolver over.\r\n\r\n"Sure. I\'m cooperative, Sheriff. Anything you say. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Send it around to my\r\nplace when you\'re done with it." He pushed his way through the crowd to\r\nthe corridor door.\r\n\r\n"The rest of you stay put!" a portly man with a head of bushy white\r\nhair pushed his way through to the bench. "I\'m calling an emergency\r\nTown Meeting to order here and now!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe banged the gavel on the scarred bench top, glanced down at the body\r\nof the dead alien, now covered by a flag.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen, we\'ve got to take fast action. If the wire services get\r\nhold of this before we\'ve gone on record, Willow Grove\'ll be a blighted\r\narea."\r\n\r\n"Look here, Willard," Judge Gates called, rising. "This--this mob isn\'t\r\ncompetent to take legal action."\r\n\r\n"Never mind what\'s legal, Judge. Sure, this calls for Federal\r\nlegislation--maybe a Constitutional amendment--but in the meantime,\r\nwe\'re going to redefine what constitutes a person within the\r\nincorporated limits of Willow Grove!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s the least we can do," a thin-faced woman snapped, glaring at\r\nJudge Gates. "Do you think we\'re going to set here and condone this\r\noutrage?"\r\n\r\n"Nonsense!" Gates shouted. "I don\'t like what happened any better than\r\nyou do--but a person--well, a person\'s got two arms and two legs and--"\r\n\r\n"Shape\'s got nothing to do with it," the chairman cut in. "Bears walk\r\non two legs! Dave Zawocky lost his in the war. Monkeys have hands."\r\n\r\n"Any intelligent creature--" the woman started.\r\n\r\n"Nope, that won\'t do, either; my unfortunate cousin\'s boy Melvin was\r\nborn an imbecile, poor lad. Now, folks, there\'s no time to waste. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
We\'ll\r\nfind it very difficult to formulate a satisfactory definition based\r\non considerations such as these. However, I think we can resolve the\r\nquestion in terms that will form a basis for future legislation on the\r\nquestion. It\'s going to make some big changes in things. Hunters aren\'t\r\ngoing to like it--and the meat industry will be affected. But if, as\r\nit appears, we\'re entering into an era of contact with ... ah ...\r\ncreatures from other worlds, we\'ve got to get our house in order."\r\n\r\n"You tell \'em, Senator!" someone yelled.\r\n\r\n"We better leave this for Congress to figger out!" another voice\r\ninsisted.\r\n\r\n"We got to do something...."\r\n\r\nThe senator held up his hands. "Quiet, everybody. There\'ll be reporters\r\nhere in a matter of minutes. Maybe our ordinance won\'t hold water. But\r\nit\'ll start \'em thinking--and it\'ll make a lots better copy for Willow\r\nGrove than the killing."\r\n\r\n"What you got in mind, Senator?"\r\n\r\n"Just this:" the Senator said solemnly. "A person is ... _any harmless\r\ncreature_...."\r\n\r\nFeet shuffled. Someone coughed.\r\n\r\n"What about a man who commits a violent act, then?" Judge Gates\r\ndemanded. "What\'s he, eh?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s obvious, gentlemen," the senator said flatly. "He\'s vermin."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the courthouse steps Cecil Stump stood, hands in hip pockets,\r\ntalking to a reporter from the big-town paper in Mattoon, surrounded\r\nby a crowd of late-comers who had missed the excitement inside. He\r\ndescribed the accuracy of his five shots, the sound they had made\r\nhitting the big blue snake, and the ludicrous spectacle the latter\r\nhad presented in its death agony. He winked at a foxy man in overalls\r\npicking his nose at the edge of the crowd.\r\n\r\n"Guess it\'ll be a while \'fore any more damned reptiles move in here\r\nlike they owned the place," he concluded.\r\n\r\nThe courthouse doors banged wide; excited citizens poured forth,\r\nveering aside from Cecil Stump. The crowd around him thinned, broke up\r\nas its members collared those emerging with the hot news. The reporter\r\npicked a target.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you\'d care to give me a few details of the action taken by\r\nthe ... ah ... Special Committee, sir?"\r\n\r\nSenator Custis pursed his lips. "A session of the Town Council was\r\ncalled," he said. "We\'ve defined what a person is in this town--"\r\n\r\nStump, standing ten feet away, snorted. "Can\'t touch me with no _ex\r\npost factory_ law."\r\n\r\n"--and also what can be classified as vermin," Custis went on.\r\n\r\nStump closed his mouth with a snap.\r\n\r\n"Here, that s\'posed to be some kind of slam at me, Custis? By God, come\r\nelection time...."\r\n\r\nAbove, the door opened again. A tall man in a leather jacket stepped\r\nout, stood looking down. The crowd pressed back. Senator Custis and\r\nthe reporter moved aside. The newcomer came down the steps slowly. He\r\ncarried Cecil Stump\'s nickel-plated .44 in his hand.\r\n\r\nStanding alone now, Stump watched him.\r\n\r\n"Here," he said. His voice carried a sudden note of strain. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
"Who\'re\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\nThe man reached the foot of the steps, raised the revolver and cocked\r\nit with a thumb.\r\n\r\n"I\'m the new exterminator," he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
