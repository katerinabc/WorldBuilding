It had been with him for two years now.\r\n\r\nThough Seligman had never been a melodramatic man, he had more than\r\nonce rolled the phrase through his mind, letting it fall from his lips:\r\n"I\'m a freak."\r\n\r\nWhich was not entirely true. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
There was no longer anyone he might have\r\ntermed "normal" for his comparison. Not only were there no more men,\r\nthere was no more life of any kind. The silence was broken only by the\r\nsearching wind, picking its way cautiously between the slow-rusting\r\ngirders of a dead past.\r\n\r\nEven as he said, "Freak!" his mind washed the word with two waves,\r\nalmost as one: vindictiveness and a resignation inextricably bound in\r\nself-pity, hopelessness and hatred.\r\n\r\n"_They_ were at fault!" he screamed at the tortured piles of masonry in\r\nhis path.\r\n\r\nAcross the viewer of his mind, thoughts twisted nimbly, knowing the\r\nroute, having traversed it often before.\r\n\r\nMan had reached for the stars, finding them within his reach were he\r\nwilling to give up his ancestral home.\r\n\r\nThose who had wanted space more than one planet had gone, out past the\r\nEdge, into the wilderness of no return. It would take years to get\r\nThere, and the Journey Back was an unthinkable one. Time had set its\r\nseal upon them: Go, if you must, but don\'t look behind you.\r\n\r\nSo they had gone. They had left the steam of Venus, the grit-wind of\r\nMars, the ice of Pluto, the sun-bake of Mercury. There had been no\r\nEarthmen left in the system of Sol. Except, of course, on Earth--which\r\nhad been left to madmen.\r\n\r\nAnd _they_ had been too busy throwing things at each other to worry\r\nabout the stars.\r\n\r\nThe men who knew no other answer stayed and fought. They were the ones\r\nwho fathered the Attilas, the Genghis Khans, the Hitlers. They were\r\nthe ones who pushed the buttons and launched the missiles that chased\r\neach other across the skies, fell like downed birds, exploded, blasted,\r\ncratered, chewed-out and carved-out the face of the planet. They were\r\nalso the little men who had failed to resist, even as they had failed\r\nto look up at the night sky.\r\n\r\nThey were the ones who had destroyed the Earth.\r\n\r\nNow no one was left. No man. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Just Seligman. And he glowed.\r\n\r\n"_They_ were at fault!" he screamed again, and the sound was a lost\r\nthing in the night.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHis mind carried him back through the years to the days near the end\r\nof what had to be the Last War, because there would be no one left to\r\nfight another. He was carried back again to the sterile white rooms\r\nwhere the searching instruments, the prying needles, the clucking\r\nscientists, all labored over him and his group.\r\n\r\nThey were to be a last-ditch throwaway. They were the indestructible\r\nmen: a new breed of soldier, able to live through the searing heat of\r\nthe bombs; to walk unaffected through the purgatory hail of radiation,\r\nto assault where ordinary men would have collapsed long before.\r\n\r\nSeligman picked his way over the rubble, his aura casting the faintest\r\nphosphorescence over the ruptured metal and plastic shreds. He paused\r\nmomentarily, eyeing the blasted remnants of a fence, to which clung a\r\nsign, held to the twined metal by one rusting bolt:\r\n\r\n                           NEWARK SPACEPORT\r\n                              ENTRANCE BY\r\n                          AUTHORIZATION ONLY\r\n\r\nShards of metal scrap moved under his bare feet, their razored edges\r\nrasping against the flesh, yet causing no break in the skin. Another\r\nproduct of the sterile white rooms and the strangely-hued fluids\r\ninjected into his body?\r\n\r\nTwenty-three young men, routine volunteers, as fit as the era of war\r\ncould produce, had been moved to the solitary block building in Salt\r\nLake City. It was a cubed structure with no windows and only one door,\r\nguarded night and day. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
If nothing else, they had security. No one knew\r\nthe intensive experimentation going on inside those steel-enforced\r\nconcrete walls, even the men upon whose bodies the experiments were\r\nbeing performed.\r\n\r\nIt was because of those experiments performed on him that Seligman was\r\nhere now, alone. Because of the myopic little men with their foreign\r\naccents and their clippings of skin from his buttocks and shoulders,\r\nthe bacteriologists and the endocrine specialists, the epidermis men\r\nand the blood-stream inspectors--because of all of them--he was here\r\nnow, when no one else had lived.\r\n\r\nSeligman rubbed his forehead at the base of the hairline. _Why_ had he\r\nlived? Was it some strain of rare origin running through his body that\r\nhad allowed him to stand the effects of the bombs? Was it a combination\r\nof the experiments performed on him--and only in a certain way on him,\r\nfor none of the other twenty-two had lived--_and_ the radiation? He\r\ngave up, for the millionth time. Had he been a student of the ills of\r\nman he might have ventured a guess, but it was too far afield for a\r\ncommon foot-soldier.\r\n\r\nAll that counted was that when he had awakened, pinned thighs, chest\r\nand arms under the masonry of a building in Salt Lake City, he was\r\nalive and could see. He could see, that is, till the tears clouded the\r\nvision of his own sick green glow.\r\n\r\nIt was life. But at times like this, with the flickering light of his\r\npassage marked on the ash-littered remains of his culture, he wondered\r\nif it was worth the agony.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe never really approached madness, for the shock of realizing he was\r\ntotally and finally alone, without a voice or a face or a touch in all\r\nthe world, overrode the smaller shock of his transformation.\r\n\r\nHe lived. He was that fabled, joked-about Last Man On Earth. But it\r\nwasn\'t a joke now.\r\n\r\nNor had the months after the final dust of extinction settled\r\nacross the planet been a joke. Those months had labored past as he\r\nsearched the country, taking what little food was still sealed from\r\nradiation--though why radiation should bother him he could not imagine;\r\nhabit more than anything--and disease, racing from one end of the\r\ncontinent in search of but one other human to share his torment.\r\n\r\nBut of course there had been no one. He was cut off like a withered arm\r\nfrom the body that was his race.\r\n\r\nNot only was he alone, and with the double terror of an aura that never\r\ndimmed, sending the word, "Freak!" pounding through his mind, but there\r\nwere other changes, equally terrifying. It had been in Philadelphia,\r\nwhile grubbing inside a broken store window that he had discovered\r\nanother symptom of his change.\r\n\r\nThe jagged glass pane had ripped the shirt through to his skin--but\r\nhad not damaged him. The flesh showed white momentarily, and then\r\neven that faded. Seligman experimented cautiously, then recklessly,\r\nand found that the radiations, or his treatments, or both, had indeed\r\nchanged him. He was completely impervious to harm of a minor sort: fire\r\nin small amounts did not bother him, sharp edges could no more rip\r\nhis flesh than they could a piece of treated steel, work produced no\r\ncallouses; he was, in a limited sense of the word, invulnerable.\r\n\r\nThe indestructible man had been created too late. Too late to bring\r\nsatisfaction to the myopic butchers who had puttered unceasingly about\r\nhis body. Perhaps had they managed to survive they might still not\r\ncomprehend what had occurred. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
It was too much like the product of a\r\nwild coincidence.\r\n\r\nBut that had not lessened his agony. Loneliness can be a powerful\r\nthing, more consuming than hatred, more demanding than mother love,\r\nmore driving than ambition. It could, in fact, drive a man to the stars.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it had been a communal yearning within his glowing breast;\r\nperhaps a sense of the dramatic or a last vestige of that unconscious\r\ndebt all men owe to their kind; perhaps it was simply an urge to\r\ntalk to someone. Seligman summed it up without soul-searching in the\r\nphilosophy, "I can\'t be any worse off than I am now, so why not?"\r\n\r\nIt didn\'t matter really. Whatever the reason, he knew by the time his\r\nsearch was over that he must seek men out, wherever in the stars they\r\nmight be, and tell them. He must be a messenger of death to his kin\r\nbeyond the Earth. They would mourn little, he knew, but still he had\r\nto tell them.\r\n\r\nHe would have to go after them and say, "Your fathers are gone. Your\r\nhome is no more. They played the last hand of that most dangerous of\r\ngames, and lost. The Earth is dead."\r\n\r\nHe smiled a tight, grim smile as he thought: At least I won\'t have to\r\ncarry a lantern to them; they\'ll see me coming by my own glow. _Glow\r\nlittle glow worm, glimmer, glimmer...._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSeligman threaded his way through the tortured wreckage and crumpled\r\nmetalwork of what had been a towering structure of shining-planed glass\r\nand steel and plastic. Even though he knew he was alone, Seligman\r\nturned and looked back over his shoulder, sensing he was being watched.\r\nHe had had that feeling many times, and he knew it for what it was. It\r\nwas Death, standing straddle-legged over the face of the land, casting\r\nshadow and eternal silence upon it. The only light came from the lone\r\nman stalking toward the rocket standing sentry like a pillar of January\r\nice in the center of the blast area.\r\n\r\nHis fingers twitched as he thought of the two years\' work that had\r\ngone into erecting that shaft of beryllium. Innumerable painstaking\r\ntrips to and from the junk heaps of that field, pirating pieces from\r\nother ships, liberating cases of parts from bombed-out storage sheds,\r\nrelentlessly forcing himself on, even when exhaustion cried its claim.\r\n\r\nSeligman had not been a scientist or a mechanic. But determination,\r\ntexts on rocket motors, and the original miracle of finding an only\r\npartially-destroyed ship with its drive still intact had provided him\r\nwith a means to leave this place of death.\r\n\r\nIt was one of the latest model ships; a _Smith_ class cruiser with\r\nconning bubble set far back on the tapered nose, and the ugly black\r\ndepressions behind which the Bergsil cannons rested on movable tracks.\r\n\r\nHe climbed the hull-ladder into the open inspection hatch, finding his\r\nway easily, even without a torch. His fingers began running over the\r\ncomplicated leads of the drive-components, checking and re-checking\r\nwhat he already knew was sound and foolproof--or as foolproof as an\r\namateur could make them.\r\n\r\nNow that it was ready, and all that remained were these routine\r\ncheck-tests and loading the food for the journey, he found himself more\r\nterrified of leaving than of remaining alone till he died--and when\r\nthat might be with his stamina he had no idea.\r\n\r\nHow would they receive a man as transformed as he? Would they not\r\ninstinctively fear, mistrust, despise him? _Am I stalling?_ The\r\nquestion suddenly formed in his mind, causing his sure inspection to\r\nfalter. Had he been purposely putting the takeoff date further and\r\nfurther ahead? Using the checks and other tasks as further attempts to\r\nstall? His head began to ache with the turmoil of his thoughts.\r\n\r\nThen he shook himself in disgust. The tests were necessary, it was\r\nstressed repeatedly in all of the texts lying about the floor of the\r\ndrive chamber.\r\n\r\nHis hands shook, but that same impetus which had carried him for two\r\nyears forced him to complete the checkups. Just as dawn oozed up over\r\nthe outline of the tatters that had been New York, he finished his work\r\non the ship.\r\n\r\nWithout pause, sensing he must race, not with time, but with the doubts\r\nraging inside him, he climbed back down the ladder and began loading\r\nfood boxes. They were stacked neatly to one side of a hand-powered lift\r\nhe had restored. The hard rubber containers of concentrates and the\r\nbulbs of carefully-sought-out liquids made an imposing and somewhat\r\nperplexing sight.\r\n\r\nFood is the main problem, he told himself. If I should get past a point\r\nof no return and find my food giving out, my chances would be nil. I\'ll\r\nhave to wait till I can find more stores of food. He estimated the time\r\nneeded for the search and realized it might be months, perhaps even\r\nanother year till he had accrued enough from the wasted stores within\r\nany conceivable distance.\r\n\r\nIn fact, finding a meal in the city, after he had carted box after box\r\nof edibles out to the rocket, had become an increasingly more difficult\r\njob. Further, he suddenly realized he had not eaten since the day\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThe day before?\r\n\r\nHe had been so engrossed in the final touches of the ship he had\r\ncompletely neglected to eat. Well, it had happened before, even before\r\nthe blast. With an effort he began to grope back, trying to remember\r\nthe last time he _had_ eaten. Then it became quite clear to him. It\r\nleaped out and dissolved away all the delays he had been contriving.\r\n_He had not eaten in three weeks._\r\n\r\nSeligman had known it, of course. But it had been buried so deeply that\r\nhe only half-feared it. He had tried to deny the truth, for when that\r\nlast seemingly insurmountable problem was removed, there was nothing\r\nbut his own inadequacies to prevent his leaving.\r\n\r\nNow it came out, full-bloom. The treatments and radiation had done more\r\nthan make him merely impervious to mild perils. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
He no longer needed to\r\neat! He boggled at the concept for a moment, shaken by the realization\r\nthat he had not recognized the fact before.\r\n\r\nHe had heard of anaerobic bacteria or yeasts that could derive their\r\nenergy from other sources, without the normal oxidation of foods.\r\nBringing the impossible to relatively homely terms made it easier for\r\nhim to accept. Maybe it was even possible to absorb energy directly. At\r\nleast he felt no slightest twinge of hunger, even after three weeks of\r\nback-breaking work without eating.\r\n\r\nProbably he would have to take along a certain amount of proteins to\r\nreplenish the body tissue he expended. But as for the bulky boxes\r\nof edibles dotting the space around the ship, most were no longer a\r\nnecessity.\r\n\r\nNow that he had faced up to the idea that he had been delaying through\r\nfear of the trip itself, and that there was nothing left to stop his\r\nleaving almost immediately, Seligman again found himself caught up in\r\nthe old drive.\r\n\r\nHe was suddenly intent on getting the ship into the air and beyond.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDusk mingled with the blotching of the sun before Seligman was ready.\r\nIt had not been stalling this time, however. The sorting and packing of\r\nneeded proteins took time. But now he was ready. There was nothing to\r\nkeep him on Earth.\r\n\r\nHe took one last look around. It seemed the thing to do. Sentimentalism\r\nwas not one of Seligman\'s more outstanding traits, but he did it in\r\npreparation for anyone who might ask him, "What did it look like--at\r\nthe end?" It was with a twinge of regret that he brought the fact to\r\nmind; he had never really _looked_ at his sterile world in the two\r\nyears he had been preparing to leave it. One became accustomed to\r\nliving in a pile of rubble, and after a bit it no longer offered even\r\nthe feel of an environment.\r\n\r\nHe climbed the ladder into the ship, carefully closing and dogging the\r\nport behind him. The chair was ready, webbing flattened back against\r\nthe deep rubber pile of its seat and backrest. He slid into it and\r\nswung the control box down on its ball-swivel to a position before his\r\nface.\r\n\r\nHe drew the top webbing across himself and snapped its triple-lock\r\nclamps into place. Seligman sat in the ship he had not even bothered to\r\nname, fingers groping for the actuator button on the arm of the chair,\r\nglowing all the while, weirdly, in the half-light of the cabin.\r\n\r\nSo this was to be the last picture he might carry with him to the\r\nheavens: a bitter epitaph to a race misspent. No warning; it was too\r\nlate for such puny action. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
All was dead and haunted on the face of the\r\nEarth. No blade of grass dared rise; no small life murmured in its\r\nburrows and caves, in the oddly dusty skies, or for all he knew, to the\r\nvery bottom of the Cayman Trench. There was only silence. The silence\r\nof a graveyard.\r\n\r\nHe pushed the button.\r\n\r\nThe ship began to rise, waveringly. There was a total lack of the\r\ngrandeur he remembered when the others had left. The ship sputtered and\r\ncoughed brokenly as it climbed on its imperfect drive. Tremors shook\r\nthe cabin and Seligman could feel something wrong, vibrating through\r\nthe chair and floor into his body.\r\n\r\nIts flames were not so bright or steady as those other take-offs, but\r\nit continued to rise and gather speed. The hull began to glow as the\r\nrocket lifted higher into the dust-filled sky.\r\n\r\nAcceleration pressed down on Seligman, though not as much as he\r\nhad expected. It was merely uncomfortable, not punishing. Then he\r\nremembered that he was not of the same stamp as those who had preceded\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHis ship continued to pull itself up out of the Earth\'s atmosphere. The\r\nhull oranged, then turned cherry, then straw-yellow, as the coolers\r\nwithin its skin fought to counteract the blasting fury.\r\n\r\nAgain and again Seligman could feel the _wrongness_ of the climb.\r\nSomething was going to give!\r\n\r\nAs the bulkheads to his right began to strain and buckle, he knew what\r\nit was. The ship had not been built or re-welded by trained experts,\r\nworking in teams with the latest equipment. He had been one lone\r\ndetermined man, with only book experience to back him. Now his errors\r\nwere about to tell.\r\n\r\nThe ship passed beyond the atmosphere, and Seligman stared in horror as\r\nthe plates cracked and shattered outwards. He tried to scream as the\r\nair shrieked outwards, but it was already impossible.\r\n\r\nThen he fainted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the ship passed the moon, Seligman still sat, his body held in\r\nplace by the now-constricted webbing, facing the gaping squares and\r\nsundered metal that had been the cabin wall.\r\n\r\nAbruptly, the engines cut off. As though it were a signal, Seligman\'s\r\neyes fluttered and opened wide.\r\n\r\nHe stared at the wall, his reviving brain grasping the final truth. The\r\nlast vestige of humanity had been clawed from him. He no longer needed\r\nair to live.\r\n\r\nHis throat constricted, his belly knotted, and the blood that should\r\ntheoretically be boiling pounded thickly in his throat. His last\r\nkinship with those he was searching was gone. If he had been a freak\r\nbefore, what was he _now_?\r\n\r\nThe turmoil fought itself out in him as the ship sped onward and he\r\nfaced what he had become, what he must do.\r\n\r\nHe was more than a messenger, now. He was a shining symbol of the end\r\nof all humanity on Earth, a symbol of the evil their kind had done. The\r\nmen out there would never treasure him, welcome him, or build proud\r\nlegends around him. But they could never deny him. He was a messenger\r\nfrom the grave.\r\n\r\nThey would see him in the airless cabin, even before he landed. They\r\nwould never be able to live with him, but they would have to listen to\r\nhim, and to believe.\r\n\r\nSeligman sat in the crash-chair in the cabin that was dark except for\r\nthe eerie glow that was part of him. He sat there, lonely and eternally\r\nalone. And slowly, a grim smile grew on his lips.\r\n\r\nThe bitter purpose that had been forced on him was finally clear.\r\nFor two years, he had fought to find an escape from the death and\r\nloneliness of ruined Earth. Now that was impossible. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
One Seligman was\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nAlone? He hadn\'t known the meaning of the word before! It would be his\r\njob to make _sure_ that he was alone--alone among his people, until the\r\nend of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
