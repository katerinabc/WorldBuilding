Like other things that can\'t be\r\n stopped...._\r\n\r\n\r\nIRRESISTIBLE WEAPON\r\n\r\nBy H. B. Fyfe\r\n\r\nIllustrated by ED EMSH\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the special observation dome of the colossal command ship just beyond\r\nPluto, every nervous clearing of a throat rasped through the silence.\r\nTelescopes were available but most of the scientists and high officials\r\npreferred the view on the huge telescreen.\r\n\r\nThis showed, from a distance of several million miles, one of the small\r\nmoons of the frigid planet, so insignificant that it had not been\r\ndiscovered until man had pushed the boundaries of space exploration past\r\nthe asteroids. The satellite was about to become spectacularly\r\nsignificant, however, as the first target of man\'s newest, most\r\ndestructive weapon.\r\n\r\n"I need not remind you, gentlemen," white-haired Co-ordinator Evora of\r\nMars had said, "that if we have actually succeeded in this race against\r\nour former Centaurian colonies, it may well prevent the imminent\r\nconflict entirely. In a few moments we shall know whether our scientists\r\nhave developed a truly irresistible weapon."\r\n\r\nOf all the officials, soldiers, and scientists present, Arnold Gibson\r\nwas perhaps the least excited. For one thing, he had labored hard to\r\nmake the new horror succeed and felt reasonably confident that it would.\r\nThe project had been given the attention of every first-class scientific\r\nmind in the Solar System; for the great fear was that the new states on\r\nthe Centaurian planets might win the race of discovery and ...\r\n\r\n_And bring a little order into this old-fashioned, inefficient fumbling\r\ntoward progress_, Gibson thought contemptuously. _Look at them--fools\r\nfor all their degrees and titles! They\'ve stumbled on something with\r\npossibilities beyond their confused powers of application._\r\n\r\nA gasp rustled through the chamber, followed by an even more awed\r\nsilence than had preceded the unbelievable, ultra-rapid action on the\r\ntelescreen. Gibson permitted himself a tight smile of satisfaction.\r\n\r\n_Now my work really begins_, he reflected.\r\n\r\nA few quick steps brought him to Dr. Haas, director of the project, just\r\nbefore the less stunned observers surrounded that gentleman, babbling\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll start collecting the Number Three string of recorders," he\r\nreported.\r\n\r\n"All right, Arnold," agreed Haas. "Tell the others to get their ships\r\nout too. I\'ll be busy here."\r\n\r\n_Not half as busy as you will be in about a day_, thought Gibson,\r\nheading for the spaceship berths.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe had arranged to be assigned the recording machines drifting in space\r\nat the greatest distance from the command ship. The others would assume\r\nthat he needed more time to locate and retrieve the apparatus--which\r\nwould give him a head start toward Alpha Centauri.\r\n\r\nHis ship was not large, but it was powerful and versatile to cope with\r\nany emergency that may have been encountered during the dangerous tests.\r\nGibson watched his instruments carefully for signs of pursuit until he\r\nhad put a few million miles between himself and the command ship. Then\r\nhe eased his craft into subspace drive and relaxed his vigilance.\r\n\r\nHe returned to normal space many "days" later in the vicinity of Alpha\r\nCentauri. They may have attempted to follow him for all he knew, but it\r\nhardly mattered by then. He broadcast the recognition signal he had been\r\ngiven to memorize long ago, when he had volunteered his services to the\r\nnew states. Then he headed for the capital planet, Nessus. Long before\r\nreaching it, he acquired a lowering escort of warcraft, but he was\r\npermitted to land.\r\n\r\n"Well, well, it\'s young Gibson!" the Chairman of Nessus greeted him,\r\nafter the newcomer had passed through the exhaustive screening designed\r\nto protect the elaborate underground headquarters. "I trust you have\r\nnews for us, my boy. Watch outside the door, Colonel!"\r\n\r\nOne of the ostentatiously armed guards stepped outside and closed the\r\ndoor as Gibson greeted the obese man sitting across the button-studded\r\nexpanse of desk. The scientist was under no illusion as to the vagueness\r\nof the title "Chairman." He was facing the absolute power of the\r\nCentaurian planets--which, in a few months\' time, would be the same as\r\nsaying the ruler of all the human race in both systems. Gibson\'s file\r\nmust have been available on the Chairman\'s desk telescreen within\r\nminutes of the reception of his recognition signal. He felt a thrill of\r\nadmiration for the efficiency of the new states and their system of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nHe made it his business to report briefly and accurately, trusting that\r\nthe plain facts of his feat would attract suitable recognition. They\r\ndid. Chairman Diamond\'s sharp blue eyes glinted out of the fat mask of\r\nhis features.\r\n\r\n"Well done, my boy!" he grunted, with a joviality he did not bother\r\ntrying to make sound overly sincere. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
"So _they_ have it! You must see\r\nour men immediately, and point out where they have gone wrong. You may\r\nleave it to me to decide _who_ has gone wrong!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nArnold Gibson shivered involuntarily before reminding himself that _he_\r\nhad seen the correct answer proved before his eyes. He had stood there\r\nand watched--more, he had worked with them all his adult life--and he\r\nwas the last whom the muddled fools would have suspected.\r\n\r\nThe officer outside the door, Colonel Korman, was recalled and given\r\norders to escort Gibson to the secret state laboratories. He glanced\r\nbriefly at the scientist when they had been let out through the\r\ncomplicated system of safeguards.\r\n\r\n"We have to go to the second moon," he said expressionlessly. "Better\r\nsleep all you can on the way. Once you\'re there, the Chairman will be\r\nimpatient for results!"\r\n\r\nGibson was glad, after they had landed on the satellite, that he had\r\ntaken the advice. He was led from one underground lab to another, to\r\ncompare Centaurian developments with Solarian. Finally, Colonel Korman\r\nappeared to extricate him, giving curt answers to such researchers as\r\nstill had questions.\r\n\r\n"Whew! Glad you got me out!" Gibson thanked him. "They\'ve been picking\r\nmy brain for two days straight!"\r\n\r\n"I hope you can stay awake," retorted Korman with no outward sign of\r\nsympathy. "If you think you can\'t, say so now. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
I\'ll have them give you\r\nanother shot. The Chairman is calling on the telescreen."\r\n\r\nGibson straightened.\r\n\r\n_Jealous snob!_ he thought. _Typical military fathead, and he knows I\r\namount to more than any little colonel now. I was smart enough to fool\r\nall the so-called brains of the Solar System._\r\n\r\n"I\'ll stay awake," he said shortly.\r\n\r\nChairman Diamond\'s shiny features appeared on the screen soon after\r\nKorman reported his charge ready.\r\n\r\n"Speak freely," he ordered Gibson. "This beam is so tight and scrambled\r\nthat no prying jackass could even tell that it is communication. Have\r\nyou set us straight?

=== Chunk 4 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Your Excellency," replied Gibson. "I merely pointed out which of\r\nseveral methods the Solarians got to yield results. Your--our scientists\r\nwere working on all possibilities, so it would have been only a matter\r\nof time."\r\n\r\n"Which you have saved us," said Chairman Diamond. His ice-blue eyes\r\nglinted again. "I wish I could have seen the faces of Haas and\r\nCo-ordinator Evora, and the rest. You fooled them completely!"\r\n\r\nGibson glowed at the rare praise.\r\n\r\n"I dislike bragging, Your Excellency," he said, "but they _are_ fools. I\r\nmight very well have found the answer without them, once they had\r\ncollected the data. My success shows what intelligence, well-directed\r\nafter the manner of the new states of Centauri, can accomplish against\r\ninefficiency."\r\n\r\nThe Chairman\'s expression, masked by the fat of his face, nevertheless\r\napproached a smile.\r\n\r\n"So you would say that you--one of _our_ sympathizers--were actually the\r\nmost intelligent worker _they_ had?"\r\n\r\n_He\'ll have his little joke_, thought Gibson, _and I\'ll let him put it\r\nover. Then, even that sour colonel will laugh with us, and the Chairman\r\nwill hint about what post I\'ll get as a reward. I wouldn\'t mind being in\r\ncharge--old Haas\' opposite number at this end._\r\n\r\n"I think I might indeed be permitted to boast of that much ability, Your\r\nExcellency," he answered, putting on what he hoped was an expectant\r\nsmile. "Although, considering the Solarians, that is not saying much."\r\n\r\nThe little joke did not develop precisely as anticipated.\r\n\r\n"Unfortunately," Chairman Diamond said, maintaining his smile\r\nthroughout, "wisdom should never be confused with intelligence."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGibson waited, feeling his own smile stiffen as he wondered what could\r\nbe going wrong. Surely, they could not doubt _his_ loyalty! A hasty\r\nglance at Colonel Korman revealed no expression on the military facade\r\naffected by that gentleman.\r\n\r\n"For if wisdom _were_ completely synonymous with intelligence," the\r\nobese Chairman continued, relishing his exposition, "you would be a\r\nrival to myself, and consequently would be--disposed of--anyway!"\r\n\r\nSuch a tingle shot up Gibson\'s spine that he was sure he must have\r\njumped.\r\n\r\n"_Anyway?_" he repeated huskily. His mouth suddenly seemed dry.\r\n\r\nChairman Diamond smiled out of the telescreen, so broadly that Gibson\r\nwas unpleasantly affected by the sight of his small, gleaming, white\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\n"Put it this way," he suggested suavely. "Your highly trained mind\r\nobserved, correlated, and memorized the most intricate data and\r\nmathematics, meanwhile guiding your social relations with your former\r\ncolleagues so as to remain unsuspected while stealing their most\r\ncherished secret. Such a feat demonstrates ability and intelligence."\r\n\r\nGibson tried to lick his lips, and could not, despite the seeming\r\nfairness of the words. He sensed a pulsing undercurrent of cruelty and\r\ncynicism.\r\n\r\n"On the other hand," the mellow voice flowed on, "having received the\r\ninformation, being able to use it effectively now without you, and\r\nknowing that you betrayed _once_--I shall simply discard you like an old\r\nmessage blank. _That_ is an act of wisdom.\r\n\r\n"Had you chosen your course more wisely," he added, "your position might\r\nbe stronger."\r\n\r\nBy the time Arnold Gibson regained his voice, the Centaurian autocrat\r\nwas already giving instructions to Colonel Korman. The scientist strove\r\nto interrupt, to attract the ruler\'s attention even momentarily.\r\n\r\nNeither paid him any heed, until he shouted and tried frenziedly to\r\nshove the soldier from in front of the telescreen. Korman backhanded him\r\nacross the throat without looking around, with such force that Gibson\r\nstaggered back and fell.\r\n\r\nHe lay, half-choking, grasping his throat with both hands until he could\r\nbreathe. The colonel continued discussing his extinction without\r\nemotion.\r\n\r\n"... so if Your Excellency agrees, I would prefer taking him back to\r\nNessus first, for the sake of the morale factor here. Some of them are\r\nso addled now at having been caught chasing up wrong alleys that they\r\ncan hardly work."\r\n\r\nApparently the Chairman agreed, for the screen was blank when the\r\ncolonel reached down and hauled Gibson to his feet.\r\n\r\n"Now, listen to me carefully!" he said, emphasizing his order with a\r\nringing slap across Gibson\'s face. "I shall walk behind you with my\r\nblaster drawn. If you make a false move, I shall not kill you."\r\n\r\nGibson stared at him, holding his bleeding mouth.\r\n\r\n"It will be much worse," Korman went on woodenly. "Imagine what it will\r\nbe like to have both feet charred to the bone. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
You would have to crawl\r\nthe rest of the way to the ship; _I_ certainly would not consider\r\ncarrying you!"\r\n\r\nIn a nightmarish daze, Gibson obeyed the cold directions, and walked\r\nslowly along the underground corridors of the Centaurian research\r\nlaboratories. He prayed desperately that someone--anyone--might come\r\nalong. _Anybody_ who could possibly be used to create a diversion, or to\r\nbe pushed into Korman and his deadly blaster.\r\n\r\nThe halls remained deserted, possibly by arrangement.\r\n\r\n_Maybe I\'d better wait till we reach his ship_, Gibson thought. _I ought\r\nto be able to figure a way before we reach Nessus. I had the brains to\r\nfool Haas and ..._\r\n\r\nHe winced, recalling Chairman Diamond\'s theory of the difference between\r\nintelligence and wisdom.\r\n\r\n_The obscene swine!_ he screamed silently.\r\n\r\nColonel Korman grunted warningly, and Gibson took the indicated turn.\r\n\r\nThey entered the spaceship from an underground chamber, and Gibson\r\nlearned the reason for his executioner\'s assurance when the latter\r\nchained him to one of the pneumatic acceleration seats. The chain was\r\nfragile in appearance, but he knew he would not be free to move until\r\nKorman so desired.\r\n\r\n_More of their insane brand of cleverness!_ he reflected. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
_That\'s the\r\nsort of thing they do succeed in thinking of. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
They\'re all crazy! Why did\r\nI ever ..._\r\n\r\nBut he shrank from the question he feared to answer. To drag out into\r\nthe open his petty, selfish reasons, shorn of the tinsel glamor of\r\nso-called "service" and "progress," would be too painful.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter the first series of accelerations, he roused himself from his\r\nbeaten stupor enough to note that Korman was taking a strange course for\r\nreaching Nessus. Then, entirely too close to the planet and its\r\nsatellites to ensure accuracy, the colonel put the ship into subspace\r\ndrive.\r\n\r\nKorman leaned back at the conclusion of the brief activity on his\r\ncontrol board, and met Gibson\'s pop-eyed stare.\r\n\r\n"Interesting, the things worth knowing," he commented. "How to make a\r\nweapon, for instance, or whether your enemy has it yet."\r\n\r\nHe almost smiled at his prisoner\'s expression.\r\n\r\n"Or even better: knowing exactly how far your enemy has progressed and\r\nhow fast he can continue, whether to stop him immediately or whether you\r\ncan remain a step ahead."\r\n\r\n"B-but--if both sides are irresistible ..." Gibson stammered.\r\n\r\nKorman examined him contemptuously.\r\n\r\n"No irresistible weapon exists, or ever will!" he declared. "Only an\r\nirresistible _process_--the transmission of secrets! You are living\r\nproof that no safeguards can defend against _that_."\r\n\r\nHe savored Gibson\'s silent discomfort.\r\n\r\n"I am sure you know how far and how fast the Centaurian scientists will\r\ngo, Gibson, since I guided you to every laboratory in that plant. Your\r\nmemory may require some painful jogging when we reach the Solar System;\r\n_but remember you shall_!"\r\n\r\n"But you--you were ordered to ..."\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t think I was a Centaurian, did you?" sneered Korman. "After I\r\njust explained to you _what_ is really irresistible?"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _If Worlds of Science Fiction_ July\r\n    1953.
