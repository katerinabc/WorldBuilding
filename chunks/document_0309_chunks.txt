I know the story because I used to\r\nbreak news on the teletype for the B. J. News Agency.\r\n\r\nThe B. J. News Agency has no ear for euphony, however, so I had to\r\nleave them and I\'m writing these memoirs while I wait for old B. J. to\r\napologize.\r\n\r\nThe first release that touched on Joe Squeeb\'s case was ticked off by\r\nme on the master sender. I still got a copy, as follows:\r\n\r\nSASSOON SEIZES SOLVER. PROFESSOR CONNOR CLAIMS IN COURT THAT\r\nCONFISCATION OF BRAIN MACHINE IS ILLEGAL.\r\n\r\nI remember I paused a couple of minutes for dramatic effect before I\r\nsent out the rest of it:\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC CIRCLES SEEK SOLACE IN SAFE SILENCE. ODDS 10 TO 1 ON\r\nSASSOON. AP.\r\n\r\nThe AP stands for me, Alfred Pennyfeather, and the B. J. News Agency\r\nalways quotes odds for its customers so they\'ll know how to write up\r\nthe stuff in their papers.\r\n\r\nA little while after I sent out the release, old B. J. himself prodded\r\nme in the ribs. B. J. is a beetle-browed person with gruff voice and a\r\nred face which can wear a very unpleasant expression. Also he has pale\r\nblue eyes like chilled marbles.\r\n\r\n"Pennyfeather," he says, "cut the comic headlines. Let our customers\r\nthink up their own. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
You just give \'em the story.

=== Chunk 3 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Yessir," I agree. But I don\'t like that crack about comic headlines.\r\n\r\n"And get some dope on the Solver," he growls as he stamps out. "Make it\r\nbrief."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWell, our files had plenty on the Solver, since it was a hot news item.\r\nThey claimed it could answer anything. It was a machine that covered an\r\nacre of floor and stood about thirty feet high--all full of wires and\r\nrelays and counters. Also there were tanks of stuff that the inventor\r\ncalled the bio-chemical conceptors. These tanks were hooked up with a\r\nmillion fine wires, from one tank to the next, and all tied in with\r\nelectronic tubes. It was a sort of super-brain.\r\n\r\nThe Solver was invented because the human brain is limited to a few\r\nconcepts at one time. Science needed a brain that could juggle a whole\r\nbunch of ideas simultaneously. And since the Solver was fed only facts,\r\nits multi-brain wasn\'t cluttered with useless junk.\r\n\r\nIt had taken months to build it--and a lot of dough. So the scientists\r\nweren\'t anxious to have it snitched from them by any politician like\r\nSassoon.\r\n\r\nI called up Professor Connor, the inventor, and told him who I was.\r\n\r\n"I have no comments for the press!" he says tartly. In the visiplate,\r\nhis beard was thrust forward so pugnaciously that it was all out of\r\nfocus and I had to peer through the brush in order to see his face.\r\n\r\n"Take it easy, Professor." I smiled suavely. "The Press is your best\r\nfriend. If you\'re getting a dirty deal we will tell the whole world\r\nabout it! Are you going to appeal the court decision?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," he says after a pause. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
"I am!" He strokes his beard so that it\r\nclears from the visiplate and I can see a fairly benign looking old\r\ngeezer. "I was only defeated on a technicality today. As inventor and\r\nowner of the Solver, my rights are patent."\r\n\r\n"How come Sassoon grabbed your gadget, Professor?"\r\n\r\n"The Solver is not a gadget!" he snaps. "It\'s a delicate machine--and\r\ndangerous! The man who controls it can solve any riddle, given time.\r\nTherefore, it should remain under scientific control. It belongs\r\nrightfully to the Science Department."\r\n\r\n"Yeah--but how about Sassoon?"\r\n\r\nThe professor\'s snort rattled the receiver.\r\n\r\n"Sassoon is already head of Geo-politics. The other departments of\r\ngovernment won\'t last long if Geo-politics controls the Solver. Sassoon\r\nis an unscrupulous bandit!" And the professor snapped off his set.\r\n\r\nMaybe he was right. In the news room it was no secret that Sassoon was\r\ngoing to be the Big Shot or bust. In fact, I had a dilly of a headline\r\nall cooked up for the day Sassoon seized the scepter.\r\n\r\nThe following morning, however, the news wasn\'t so funny. Professor\r\nConnor was going to see his lawyer that day. Here\'s the teletype copy:\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR CONNOR KILLED IN CRASH. CAR COLLIDES WITH CAB AT CORNER OF\r\n5TH AND GRAND. CONNOR\'S CORPSE CONSIGNED TO CREMATORY. ODDS 50 TO 1 ON\r\nSASSOON. AP.\r\n\r\nOld B. J. raised holy cain over that one!\r\n\r\n"Connor\'s corpse consigned to crematory!" he yowled. "One more crack\r\nlike that and you, Pennyweight, are fired!"\r\n\r\n"Pennyfeather," I correct B. J.\r\n\r\n"Featherweight, Pennyweather, Periwinkle!" he foams. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
"What\'s the odds!\r\nYou Featherbrain!"\r\n\r\nBefore I can answer, he\'s gone, slamming the door and blowing papers\r\noff my desk.\r\n\r\nWell, a couple of days later Sassoon announces that the Solver will be\r\nunveiled to the public with due ceremony, come Wednesday. The Science\r\nDepartment is invited to attend at the Solver Building. Which is very\r\nmagnanimous, considering that the Science Department paid for the\r\nbuilding and the Solver too!\r\n\r\n"Jellyfeather," says old B. J. "You go down and cover this unveiling."\r\n\r\nThat\'s how I came to witness the Joe Squeeb incident.\r\n\r\nI had a seat in the hall right down in front--just behind the\r\ndisgruntled-looking scientists. Maybe they had a right to feel that\r\nway, but they knew better than to ignore Sassoon\'s invitation. Sassoon\r\nwas very sensitive about such things as being snubbed. So they were all\r\nthere, sitting like a row of hungry blackbirds.\r\n\r\nUp on the platform, the chairman opened the proceedings with a nice\r\nlittle speech which safely said nothing, and then he handed over the\r\nmeeting to Sassoon.\r\n\r\nSassoon was a big, fat man with slick black hair and eyes that reminded\r\nme of old B. J.\'s. Fishy. Sassoon, however, put on the jolly act--big\r\nsmile and breezy manner, the "we\'re-all-one-big-family" touch.\r\n\r\nMost of the people fell for it, and gave him a laugh when he sprung\r\nhis warming-up joke. But the boys with the brains in front of me just\r\ngloomed. I saw Sassoon give them a quick once-over before he went on to\r\ndescribe the wonders of the Solver. He gave a pretty good speech, too,\r\nif you didn\'t know what was behind it.\r\n\r\n"Mankind," he finally ended, "will look back on this day as on the dawn\r\nof a new era. Posterity will bathe in the flow of a new wisdom that has\r\ncome from our hands!"\r\n\r\nThen he pulled a cord that opened a huge curtain behind him, and the\r\nSolver was unveiled. Appropriate oh\'s and ah\'s followed. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
It did look\r\nimpressive at that. Like a gigantic calculating machine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn front of it there was a wide platform with several desks. These\r\nwere occupied by attendants ready to feed data which the Solver might\r\nrequire. Each desk had a microphone for that purpose, and there was one\r\ngilded microphone near Sassoon. This one was for stating the question.\r\nA large loudspeaker was suspended high up to deliver the Solver\'s\r\nanswers.\r\n\r\nI once read that the ancient Greeks had a similar setup, called the\r\nDelphic Oracle. Only some fellow got the wrong answer once and blew the\r\nwhole works some way.\r\n\r\n"And now," Sassoon beamed on his audience, "we will demonstrate the\r\nSolver in action. Perhaps we should allow our scientific friends the\r\nhonor of asking it the first riddle. After all, we owe science a great\r\ndeal, ha-ha!"\r\n\r\nBut none of the savants made a move. Maybe they felt balky. However,\r\nSassoon was too smart to allow any awkward pauses.\r\n\r\n"But then, perhaps the honor should go to some less illustrious\r\nperson." His cold eyes had spotted the figure of a little man in\r\noveralls, standing in a half-open doorway. The little man leaned on a\r\nbroom. I found out later he was Joe Squeeb, the janitor of Solver Hall.\r\n\r\n"Since we must always remember our democratic traditions," Sassoon\'s\r\nvoice was slick as warm margarine, "I think our humblest worker should\r\nhave the great honor of asking the Solver its first public question.\r\nCome here--you!"\r\n\r\nThe janitor dropped his broom and turned to flee, but Sassoon\'s voice,\r\nwith just a slight grate to it, pinned him in his tracks like a\r\nmesmerized rabbit.\r\n\r\n"Come, come. You, with the broom. Step up here!"\r\n\r\nJoe Squeeb moved as if pulled by invisible chains. On the stage with\r\nSassoon, he blinked nervously at the audience. Then he suddenly\r\ngrinned, showing snaggy teeth, like a man who feels he\'s a goner.\r\nSassoon towered over him as they talked together for a moment before\r\nSassoon turned to face the audience again.\r\n\r\n"This, ah, gentleman, is Joe Squeeb, our janitor. He has agreed to try\r\nand stump the Solver, ha-ha!"\r\n\r\nSassoon\'s great hand smacked Squeeb on the back and nearly sent the\r\nlittle man sprawling into the row of stony-faced scientists.\r\n\r\n"And now, Mr. Squeeb--ask your question." Sassoon pushed him to the\r\ngilded microphone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "Ask it a question."]\r\n\r\nSqueeb\'s Adam\'s apple bobbed. He shuffled his feet and twisted his\r\nscrawny neck. I heard his panicky whisper to Sassoon.\r\n\r\n"What\'ll I ask it?"\r\n\r\n"Come, come!" Sassoon frowned heavily. "Don\'t jump around like that!\r\nAsk it some question in arithmetic. Or maybe you know all the answers,\r\nho-ho!"\r\n\r\nSqueeb rolled his eyes. I guess he wasn\'t used to thinking because he\r\nacted as if he was in pain. Then, suddenly, his face lighted up.\r\n\r\n"I got it," he said triumphantly. "I remember a problem that stuck all\r\nof us."\r\n\r\nEvidently he had dredged the depths of his mind for some long forgotten\r\nproblem of high school days.\r\n\r\n"All right." Sassoon switched on the control. "Ask it, man, and get it\r\nover!"\r\n\r\nSqueeb gulped, gave his waiting audience a last hopeless grin, and\r\ncleared his throat.\r\n\r\n"Exactly what is the area of a circle," he asked brightly, "with a\r\nradius of one inch?"\r\n\r\nBertrand, the great mathematician, sitting just in front of me, gave a\r\nsort of gasp. Then the raspy notes of the Solver squawked a reply.\r\n\r\n"The area of a circle with a radius of one inch is exactly--Three point\r\none, four, one, five--nine--two--six--"\r\n\r\nBertrand, the mathematician, had a notebook and pen out, scribbling as\r\nthe Solver announced the figures in a plodding monotone. He covered one\r\nline and started on the next.\r\n\r\nThe audience began to stir impatiently. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
This was not very entertaining.\r\nSassoon frowned, quickly smiled again.\r\n\r\n"How long does this go on?" he asked jocularly.\r\n\r\nOne of the desk attendants moved forward.\r\n\r\n"It\'ll be quite a long time," he said. "The answer has never been\r\ncompleted."\r\n\r\n"Oh--six-- --nine-- -- --five," the Solver intoned persistently.\r\n\r\n"Switch the blasted thing off!" Sassoon ordered irritably.\r\n\r\nThe Solver gurgled to silence.\r\n\r\n"Now." Sassoon cleared his throat. "We will ask it another question."\r\n\r\nThe same attendant coughed discreetly.\r\n\r\n"Just a minute, Mr. Sassoon," he said apologetically as the boss\r\nof Geo-politics swung around to face him. "The Solver is not purely\r\nmechanical, you know. The actual work is done by the bio-chemical cells\r\nand these cannot be reset to zero without discharging their concept\r\nenergy."\r\n\r\n"Huh?" Sassoon frowned at the interruption. "Well, discharge \'em!

=== Chunk 8 ===
"\r\n\r\n"That\'s the trouble, sir. A Solver cell is like a human brain cell,\r\nit must complete its function in order to relapse into inactivity.\r\nShutting off the Solver merely holds its processes in abeyance. When we\r\nswitch on the power again, the cells will continue where they left off\r\ntill their task is completed."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSassoon thought that one over.\r\n\r\n"Then switch it back on again. Let\'s get this over," he snapped, and\r\nturned to look for Joe Squeeb. But the janitor had discreetly faded.\r\nHis broom leaned, deserted, in the doorway. Squeeb wasn\'t so dumb as he\r\nlooked!\r\n\r\n"Nine-- --Six-- -- --Four--" The Solver was slowing down a little as\r\nthe calculations became more involved with unwieldy quotients. But\r\nthere was grim resolve in the metallic tone.\r\n\r\nI tapped Bertrand on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n"How long will this take?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Couldn\'t say." 

=== Chunk 9 ===
He smiled thinly. "We once wore out several machines\r\non that problem. Imagine a Joe Squeeb saving us from--" He stopped\r\nabruptly.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you tell the Solver some way that the present answer is close\r\nenough?"\r\n\r\nBertrand shook his head.\r\n\r\n"As you may recall, Joe Squeeb definitely asked for an exact answer.\r\nThe Solver will give it--regardless!"\r\n\r\n"Eight-- --one-- --two--" The Solver was beginning to sound labored.\r\nInside the great machine relays were madly racing.\r\n\r\n"I guess Joe Squeeb just lost a job," I murmured.\r\n\r\n"He has another job waiting for him." Bertrand almost grinned. "We need\r\nsomeone to dust our equipment--someone who knows enough not to monkey\r\nwith things. It\'ll really be a pension job."\r\n\r\nI looked at Sassoon. He appeared very unhappy. Not only had he made\r\na chump of himself, but it looked as if he\'d spiked his own guns by\r\ngumming up the Solver. He couldn\'t use the machine for his own ends and\r\nhe\'d have no excuse for stealing the next one to be built.\r\n\r\nWhen I left Solver Hall the machine was gurgling a number about\r\nevery twenty seconds and slowing down all the time. Sassoon had\r\nasked Bertrand to get busy and shut it up some way, and Bertrand was\r\ngently explaining to him that it was merely a matter of time--lots of\r\ntime--before the Solver would stop. Unless Sassoon wanted it torn apart.\r\n\r\nI sent out a teletype release to the waiting world. It read:\r\n\r\nSASSOON SUMMONS SCIENTISTS FOR SOLUTION AS SOLVER STRANGLES ON SQUARING\r\nOF CIRCLE. SASSOON SWEARS TO SILENCE SOLVER. ODDS 1,000,000 TO 1 ON\r\nSOLVER. AP.\r\n\r\nTen seconds after the release, old B. J. was at my desk. Red eyed!\r\n\r\n"Pinfeather," he roars, "you\'re fired!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s Pennyfeather," I retort. "And I quit two seconds before you\r\nspoke!"\r\n\r\n"All right, all right! Bunnyweather, then!" He clutches the edge of my\r\ndesk. "Only get out of my sight! 

=== Chunk 10 ===
Quick!"\r\n\r\nAnd that is Joe Squeeb\'s story. Right now he\'s working for swell wages\r\nat Science Hall. They all call him Joe and ask him all the time how\r\nis his family and how is his arthritis. He\'s even putting on a little\r\nweight.\r\n\r\nAs for old B. J.--I figure he\'ll come around to me, apologizing, some\r\nday. Unless apoplexy gets him first. I\'m just waiting while I write\r\nthese memoirs.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
