Why? 

=== Chunk 2 ===
How? For the first time\r\n             anywhere, here is the startling inside story.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe had flared up more brightly than anyone in memory. And then he was\r\ngone. Yet there was ironic laughter where he had been; and his ghost\r\nstill walked. That was the oddest thing: to encounter his ghost.\r\n\r\nIt was like coming suddenly on Haley\'s Comet drinking beer at the\r\nPlugged Nickel Bar, and having it deny that it was a celestial\r\nphenomenon at all, that it had ever been beyond the sun. For he could\r\nhave been the man of the century, and now it was not even known if he\r\nwas alive. And if he were alive, it would be very odd if he would be\r\nhanging around places like the Plugged Nickel Bar.\r\n\r\nThis all begins with the award. But before that it begins with the man.\r\n\r\nProfessor Aloys Foulcault-Oeg was acutely embarrassed and in a state of\r\ndread.\r\n\r\n"These I have to speak to, all these great men. Is even glory worth\r\nthe price when it must be paid in such coin?"\r\n\r\nAloys did not have the amenities, the polish, the tact. A child of\r\npenury, he had all his life eaten bread that was part sawdust, and worn\r\nshoes that were part cardboard. He had an overcoat that had been his\r\nfather\'s, and before that his grandfather\'s.\r\n\r\nThis coat was no longer handsome, its holes being stuffed and quilted\r\nwith ancient rags. It was long past its years of greatness, and even\r\nwhen Aloys had inherited it as a young man it was in the afternoon of\r\nits life. And yet it was worth more than anything else he owned in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nProfessor Aloys had become great in spite of--or because of?--his\r\npoverty. He had worked out his finest theory, a series of nineteen\r\ninterlocked equations of cosmic shapeliness and simplicity. He had\r\nworked it out on a great piece of butchers\' paper soaked with lamb\'s\r\nblood, and had so given it to the world.\r\n\r\nAnd once it was given, it was almost as though nothing else could be\r\nadded on any subject whatsoever. Any further detailing would be only\r\nfootnotes to it and all the sciences no more than commentaries.\r\n\r\nNaturally this made him famous. But the beauty of it was that it\r\nmade him famous, not to the commonalty of mankind (this would have\r\nbeen a burden to his sensitively tuned soul), but to a small and\r\nscattered class of extremely erudite men (about a score of them in the\r\nworld). Their recognition brought him almost, if not quite, complete\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nBut he was not famous in his own street or his own quarter of town. And\r\nit was in this stark conglomerate of dark-souled alleys and roofs that\r\nProfessor Aloys had lived all his life till just thirty-seven days ago.\r\n\r\nWhen he received the announcement, award, and invitation, he quickly\r\ncalculated the time. It was not very long to allow travel halfway\r\naround the world. Being locked out of his rooms, as he often was, he\r\nwas unencumbered by baggage or furniture, and he left for the ceremony\r\nat once.\r\n\r\nWith the announcement, award, and invitation, there had also been a\r\ncheck; but as he was not overly familiar with the world of finance or\r\nwith the English language in which it was written, he did not recognize\r\nit for what it was. Having used the back of it to write down a formula\r\nthat had crept into his mind, he shoved the check, forgotten, into one\r\nof the pockets of his greatcoat.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor three days he rode a river boat to the port city, hidden and\r\nhungry. There he concealed himself on an ocean tramp. That he did not\r\nstarve on this was due to the caprice of the low-lifers who discovered\r\nhim, for they made him stay hidden in a terrible bunker and every day\r\nor two they passed in a bucket to him.\r\n\r\nThen, several ports and many days later, he left the ship like a\r\ncrippled, dirty animal. And it was in That City and on That Day. For\r\nthe award was to be that evening.\r\n\r\n"These I have to speak to, all these wonderful men who are higher than\r\nthe grocers, higher than the butchers even. These men get more respect\r\nthan a policeman, than a canal boat captain. They are wiser than a\r\nmayor and more honored than a merchant. They know arts more intricate\r\nthan a clock-maker\'s and are virtuous beyond the politicians. More\r\nperspicacious than editors, more talented than actors, these are the\r\ngreat men of the world. And I am only Aloys, and now I am too ragged\r\nand dirty even to be Aloys any more. I no longer am a man with a name."\r\n\r\nFor he was very humble as he walked the great town where even the shop\r\ngirls were dressed like princesses, and all the restaurants were so\r\nfine that only the rich people would have dared to go in them at all.\r\nHad there been poor people (and there were none) there would have been\r\nno place for them to eat.\r\n\r\n"But it is to me they have given the prize. Not to Schellendore and not\r\nto Ottlebaum, not to Francks nor Timiryaseff, not even to Pitirim-Koss,\r\nthe latchet of whose shoe I am not--but why do I say that?--he was not,\r\nafter all, very bright--all of them are inadequate in some way--the\r\nonly one who was ever able to get to the heart of these great things\r\nwas Aloys Foulcault-Oeg, who happens to be myself. It is a strange\r\nthing that they should honor me, and yet I believe they could not have\r\nmade a better choice."\r\n\r\nSo pride and fear warred in him, but it was always the pride that lost.\r\nFor he had only a little bit of pride, undernourished and on quaking\r\nground, and against it was a whole legion of fears, apprehensions,\r\nshames, dreads, embarrassments, and nightmarish bashfulnesses.\r\n\r\nHe begged a little bit when he had found a poor part of town. But even\r\nhere the people were of the rich poor, not the poor as he had known\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWhen he had money in his pocket, he had a meal. Then he went to Jiffy\r\nQuick While You Wait Cleaners Open Day and Night to have his clothes\r\ncleaned. He wrapped himself in dignity and a blanket while he waited.\r\nAnd as the daylight was coming to an end, they brought his clothes back\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n"We have done all we could do. If we had a week or a month, we might do\r\na little more, but not much."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen he went out into the town, cleaner than he had been in many\r\nyears, and he walked to the hall of the Commendation and Award. Here\r\nhe watched all the great men arrive in private cars and taxis: Ergodic\r\nEimer, August Angstrom, Vladimir Vor. He watched them and thought of\r\nwhat he would say to them, and then he realized that he had forgotten\r\nhis English.\r\n\r\n"I remember dog, that is the first word I ever learned, but what will I\r\nsay to them about a dog? I remember house and horse and apple and fish.\r\nOh, now I remember the entire language. But what if I forget it again?\r\nWould it not be an odd speech if I could only say apple and fish and\r\nhouse and dog? I would be shamed.

=== Chunk 3 ===
"\r\n\r\nHe wished he were rich and could dress in white like the street\r\nsweepers, or in black leather like the newsboy on the corner. He saw\r\nEdward Edelstein and Christopher Cronin enter and he cowered on the\r\nstreet and knew that he would never be able to talk to those great men.\r\n\r\nA fine gentleman came out and walked directly to him.\r\n\r\n"You are the great Professor Foulcault-Oeg? I would have known you\r\nanywhere. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
True greatness shines from you. Our city is honored tonight.\r\nCome inside and we will go to a little room apart, for I see that\r\nyou will have to compose yourself first. I am Graf-Doktor Hercule\r\nBienville-Stravroguine."\r\n\r\nWhyever he said he was the Graf-Doktor is a mystery, because he was\r\nWilly McGilly and the other was just a name that he made up that minute.\r\n\r\nWithin, they went to a small room behind the cloak room. But here, in\r\nspite of the smooth kindness of the gracious gentleman, Aloys knew\r\nthat he would never be able to compose himself. He was an epouvantail,\r\na pugalo, a clown, a ragamuffin. He looked at the nineteen-point\r\noutline of the address he was to give. He shuddered and he gobbled\r\nlike a turkey. He sniffled and he wiped his nose on his sleeve. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
He was\r\nterrified that the climax of his life\'s work should find him too craven\r\nto accept it. And he discovered that he had forgotten his English\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"I remember bread and butter, but I don\'t know which one goes on top.\r\nI know pencil and pen-knife and bed, but I have entirely forgotten the\r\nword for maternal uncle. I remember plow, but what in the world will I\r\nsay to all these great men about a plow? I pray that this cup may pass\r\nfrom me.

=== Chunk 6 ===
"\r\n\r\nThen he disintegrated in one abject mass of terror. Several minutes\r\nwent by.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut when he emerged from the room he was a different man entirely.\r\nErect, alive, intense, queerly handsome, and now in formal attire, he\r\nmounted with the sure grace of a panther to the speaker\'s platform.\r\nOnce only he glanced at the nineteen-point outline of his address.\r\nAs there is no point in keeping it a secret, it was as follows: 1.\r\nCepheid and Cerium--How Long Is a Yardstick? 2. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Double Trouble--Is\r\nOurs a Binary Universe? 3. Cerebrum and Cortex--the Mathematics of\r\nMelancholia. 4. Microphysics and Megacyclic Polyneums. 5. _Ego, No,\r\nHemeis_--the Personality of the Subconscious. 6. Linear Convexity\r\nand Lateral Intransigence. 7. Betelgeuse Betrayed--the Myth of\r\nMagnitude. 8. Mu-Meson, the Secret of Metamorphosis. 9. Theogony and\r\nTremor--the Mathematics of Seismology. 10. Planck\'s Constant and\r\nAgnesi\'s Variable. 11. Dien-cephalon and Di-Gamma--Unconscionable\r\nThoughts about Consciousness. 12. Inverse Squares and the Quintesimal\r\nRadicals. 13. The Chain of Error in the Lineal B Translation. 14.\r\nSkepticism--the Humor of the Humorless. 15. Ogive and Volute--Thoughts\r\non Celestial Curviture. 16. Conic Sections--Small Pieces of Infinity.\r\n17. Eschatology--Medium Thoughts about the End. 18. Hypo-polarity and\r\nCosmic Hysteresis. 19. The Invisible Quadratic, or This is All Simpler\r\nthan You Think.\r\n\r\nYou will immediately see the beauty of this skeleton, and yet to flesh\r\nit would not be the work of an ordinary man.\r\n\r\nHe glanced over it with the sure smile of complete confidence. Then he\r\nspoke softly to the master of ceremonies in a whisper with a rumble\r\nthat could be heard throughout the hall.\r\n\r\n"I am here. I will begin. There is no need for any further\r\nintroduction."\r\n\r\nFor the next three and a half hours he held that intelligent audience\r\ncompletely spellbound, enchanted. They followed, or seemed to follow,\r\nhis lightning flashes of metaphor illumining the craggy chasms of his\r\nvasty subjects.\r\n\r\nThey thrilled to the magnetic power of his voice, urbane yet untamed,\r\nwith its polyglot phrasing and its bare touch of accent so strange as\r\nto be baffling; ancient, surely, and yet from a land beyond the Pale.\r\nAnd they quivered with interior pleasure at the glorious unfolding in\r\nclimax after climax of these before only half-glimpsed vistas.\r\n\r\nHere was a world of mystery revealed in all its wildness, and it obeyed\r\nand stood still, and he named its name. The nebula and the conch lay\r\ndown together, and the ultra-galaxies equated themselves with the zeta\r\nmesons. Like a rich householder, he brought from his store treasures\r\nold and new, and nothing like them had ever been seen or heard before.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt one point Professor Timiryaseff cried out in bafflement and\r\nincomprehension, and Doctor Ergodic Eimer buried his face in his hands,\r\nfor even these most erudite men could not glimpse all the shattering\r\nprofundity revealed by the fantastic speaker.\r\n\r\nAnd when it was over they were limp and delighted that so much had been\r\nmade known to them. They had the crown without the cross, and the odd\r\nlittle genius had filled them with a rich glow.\r\n\r\nThe rest was perfunctory, commendations and testimonials from all\r\nthe great men. The trophy, heavy and rich but not flashy, worth the\r\nlifetime salary of a professor of mathematics, was accepted almost\r\ncarelessly. And then the cup was passed quietly, which is to say the\r\ntall cool glasses went around as the men still lingered and talked with\r\nhushed pleasure.\r\n\r\n"Gin," said the astonishing orator. "It is the drink of bums and\r\nimpoverished scholars, and I am both. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
Yes, anything at all with it."\r\n\r\nThen he spoke to Maecenas, who was at his side, the patron who was\r\nfooting the bill for all this gracious extravagance.\r\n\r\n"The check I have never cashed, having been much in movement since I\r\nhave received it. And as to me it is a large amount, though perhaps not\r\nto others, and as you yourself have signed it, I wonder if you could\r\ncash it for me now."\r\n\r\n"At once," said Maecenas, "at once. Ten minutes and we shall have the\r\nsum here. Ah, you have endorsed it with a formula! Who but Professor\r\nAloys Foulcault-Oeg could be so droll? Look, he has endorsed it with a\r\nformula!"\r\n\r\n"Look, look! Let us copy! Why, this is marvelous! It takes us even\r\nbeyond his great speech of tonight. The implications of it!

=== Chunk 9 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Oh, the implications!" they said as they copied it off, and the\r\nimplications rang in their heads like bells of the future.\r\n\r\nNow it had suddenly become very late, and the elated little man with\r\nthe gold and gemmed trophy under one arm and the packet of bank notes\r\nin his pocket disappeared as by magic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nProfessor Aloys Foulcault-Oeg was not seen again; or, if seen, he was\r\nnot known, for hardly anyone would have known his face. In fact, when\r\nhe had painfully released the bonds by which he had been tied in the\r\nlittle room behind the cloak room, and removed the shackles from his\r\nankles, he did not pause at all, but slipped into his greatcoat and ran\r\nout into the night. Not for many blocks did he even remove the gag from\r\nhis mouth, not realizing in his confusion what it was that obstructed\r\nhis speech and breathing. But when he got it out, it was a pleasant\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\nA kind gentleman took him in hand, the second to do so that night. He\r\nwas bundled into a kind of taxi and driven to a mysterious quarter\r\ncalled Wreckville. And deep inside a secret building he was given a\r\nbath and a bowl of hot soup. And later he gathered with others at a\r\nfestive board.\r\n\r\nHere Willy McGilly was king. As he worked his way into his cups with\r\nthe gold trophy in front of him, he expounded and elucidated.\r\n\r\n"I was wonderful. I held them in the palm of my hand. Was I not\r\nwonderful, Oeg?"\r\n\r\n"I could not hear all, for I was on the floor of the little room. But\r\nfrom what I could hear, yes, you were wonderful."\r\n\r\n"Only once in my life did I give a better speech. It was the same\r\nspeech, but it was newer then. This was in Little Dogie, New Mexico,\r\nand I was selling a snake-oil derivative whose secret I still cannot\r\nreveal. But I was good tonight and some of them cried. And now what\r\nwill you do, Oeg? Do you know what we are?"\r\n\r\n"_Moshennekov._"\r\n\r\n"Why, so we are."\r\n\r\n"_Schwindlern._"\r\n\r\n"The very word."\r\n\r\n"Low-life con men. And the world you live on is not the one you were\r\nborn on. I will join you if I may."\r\n\r\n"Oeg, you have a talent for going to the core of the apple."\r\n\r\nFor when a man (however unlikely a man) shows real talent, then the\r\nWreckville bunch has to recruit him. They cannot have uncontrolled\r\ntalent running loose in the commonalty of mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
