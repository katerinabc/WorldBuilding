"This is getting us nowhere," I remarked, "nowhere at all."\r\n\r\nHe nodded and sat down on the hard stone. We were trapped under the\r\nbuilding. The house had come down over us when the bomb landed in the\r\nstreet. The rest of the tenants were probably away or dead. Apparently\r\nonly the little old man who lived on the second floor rear and I had\r\ngotten down to the bomb-proof cellar in time. And now we were trapped.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll have to wait until they dig us out," I said. We couldn\'t\r\npossibly dig our own way out. Too much blocked us in. We were buried\r\nbeneath tons of brick, rubbish and beams. They were probably busy in\r\nthe street outside, trying to rescue the people in other, less-damaged\r\nbuildings. Then again there might be fire, and the noise effectively\r\nblocked any chance of their hearing us.\r\n\r\nI saw him only by the light of my little pocket flash. That wouldn\'t\r\nlast very long. Our space was remarkably limited. This shelter had been\r\na part of the cellar. It had been blocked off and roofed over, but\r\neven so, part of it fell in--the part with the supplies and stuff--the\r\npart opening on the exit.\r\n\r\n"Well," I said, just to say something, "what do we do now? Sit around\r\nand wait to die?"\r\n\r\nThe little old man wrinkled his brow in thought. He didn\'t seem too\r\nworried about dying. I guess when you\'re his age and have a long gray\r\nbeard you get reconciled to the prospect. But I was young, and frankly\r\nI didn\'t like the idea at all.\r\n\r\n"I think I know a way," the little old man said finally, "but it will\r\nseem like madness. Probably it is. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
It\'s never been tried. It may never\r\nwork."\r\n\r\nI seized him by the lapels. "Any way is better than none. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
I\'d rather\r\ndie trying than sitting down moping my life away. Tell it to me."\r\n\r\n"You won\'t laugh? You will take whatever I say seriously?" the little\r\nold man asked anxiously.\r\n\r\nI saw he didn\'t want to die the object of scorn, and I saw also that he\r\nmust have something pretty odd up his sleeve. "No," I answered, "you\r\nwon\'t hear a peep out of me."\r\n\r\n"Then," said the old man, "if you can prepare yourself, you could walk\r\nout through the rocks."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn spite of my promise, I gasped. But then I squelched myself and\r\nthought that if I was with a lunatic, I might as well make the most\r\nof it. He was now the other half of my universe and so standards had\r\nchanged. Facing death, any straw will do.\r\n\r\n"Proceed," I said. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
"Explain further."\r\n\r\n"Rocks," said the little old man--I guess he must have been a scientist\r\nof some sort--"and all other matter are composed of nothing mainly,\r\nwith a little vibration thrown in."\r\n\r\nI kept my mouth shut. I wasn\'t going to say anything to the contrary\r\neven if he claimed black was white.\r\n\r\n"Matter," he went on, "is composed entirely of atom. Atoms are broken\r\ndown to electrons and protons and their kin. They, in turn, appear to\r\nbe nothing but charges of electricity, charges of energy, not matter.\r\nSo that all matter is really just a manifestation of energy in a\r\npeculiar state of stress."\r\n\r\nI waited. This made sense. I began to recognize some of the things I\r\nhad learned years ago in high school physics.\r\n\r\n"Between the vortices of energy which make up the building-blocks of\r\nmatter, there are comparatively vast stretches of just plain empty\r\nspace. Within the atom, almost all is vacuum. Between molecules, more\r\nvacuum. In a so-called solid mass, it could be demonstrated that less\r\nthan a quadrillionth part of its mass has any reality and that only\r\nin the form of disturbances of energy. And that figure is grossly\r\nexaggerated."\r\n\r\nI waited. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
This was still making sense. And anyway, when you are\r\nhopelessly trapped there is no sense in being impatient.\r\n\r\n"If," went on the professor, "you understand this and project the\r\npicture of it in your mind, you can mentally resolve all things into\r\nswirls of nothingness, into less than air. If you can do so, you can\r\nattain complete control over your own body--for we alone are able to\r\ncontrol our own masses by means of will.\r\n\r\n"And if you can picture these masses of rock as pools of nothing and\r\nyourself as the same, you can pass yourself through these rocks as a\r\nwhiff of smoke in air. You can revisualize yourself as solid outside\r\nthis trapping pile."\r\n\r\nI thought about it. Wild it was and yet based on real reasoning.\r\n\r\n"If you will give your mind to me, let me hypnotize you with your\r\ncooperation, I think I can cause that to happen. You will then pass\r\nthrough the rocks and appear outside. Then you will send for me," he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nI thought that over. "Why don\'t you do it yourself?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"I am old and it is better done with an outside subject. Do not forget\r\nthat this has never been done."\r\n\r\n"Okay. Start," I said, suddenly making up my mind. I didn\'t want to die\r\nand I would do anything, however wild, to avoid it. When one sits alone\r\nin darkness beneath a ruined house and knows that there is no hope, a\r\ndecision like this comes normally.\r\n\r\nAll is logical according to the conditions given.\r\n\r\nI gave him my flashlight and he shone it in my eyes. Then he started\r\nweaving it and repeating what he had said about atoms and electrons and\r\nmasses of nothing.\r\n\r\nI watched him fascinated, and I thought of little whirlpools in empty\r\nblack space. I saw flashing ripples on a void. I saw lone lights\r\nuntended in nothingness and reflected from nothing. And I saw that they\r\nwere glowing from nothing. Light, just light.\r\n\r\nI saw a solitary mote pursuing an endless track across a vast area that\r\nwas utter abyss.\r\n\r\nGradually the flashlight seemed to flicker and die. I felt wavy and\r\nmistlike. I understood the meaning of matter and I saw indeed that\r\nmatter has very little real existence.\r\n\r\nI felt that I was upon my feet, and they were long columns of\r\nimagination having no reality save for endless electric foam.\r\n\r\nI felt myself moving forward and I felt other disturbances passing\r\nbetween me and around me and through me.\r\n\r\nThen I saw that scenes were passing before my vision and the globules\r\nof vacua that were my eyes seemed to register as they passed through\r\nother globules of vacua.\r\n\r\nI saw what seemed like a tiny planet spinning on its axis, while a\r\nstrange blue sun shone down and a dozen other planets swirled.\r\n\r\nI saw a figure indescribable, mounted upon a thing incredible, pursuing\r\nthe unknowable across a vast and meaningless place.\r\n\r\nI saw dozens of things like this--none of which can be described. Once\r\nI saw a large machine with churning arms and it was all bubbly and yet\r\nhard and mechanical.\r\n\r\nAll about me moved a great current and a wave of feelingless substance.\r\n\r\nThen I felt a beating of forces upon me, I felt a hammering at me and I\r\nfelt a pressure pushing upon the whirling, imaginary pools of my being\r\nand a curious coldness setting in.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI shivered and looked around. I was naked in the middle of the street;\r\nthe stars were out and the drone of airplanes audible. People were\r\nrunning up and down and a hose was playing upon the front of a burning\r\nbuilding. The wardens were digging in some ruins with crowbars and\r\nshovels.\r\n\r\nA man came running up to me and threw a blanket over my trembling\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\n"Where\'d you come from? Bomb blow your clothes off? It happens."\r\n\r\nI pointed to the pile of bricks and junk that marked my house.\r\n\r\n"There\'s a man buried in those ruins, but he\'s alive," I said. "Just\r\ntrapped. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
You\'ll have to dig him out."\r\n\r\nThe warden blew his whistle and out of the turmoil three other men came\r\nwith picks and equipment and began to dig.\r\n\r\nBut it was two days before they finally got to him--and by that time he\r\nwas dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
