]\r\n\r\n\r\n"You have no choice," the patrolman said. "The Council sends for you."\r\n\r\nHe moved across the veranda of Heric\'s cottage, bulking dark against\r\nthe sky-glow of Nyark the first city. On the slope of lawn below stood\r\nhis copter, its beetle-black shell glistening faintly in the starshine.\r\n\r\nHeric stood rigid with alarm in his doorway, still holding the book\r\nhe had been reading. The night-wind ruffling his hair and the homely\r\nsounds from the kitchen where Marta prepared their evening meal made\r\nhis danger doubly fantastic.\r\n\r\n"They\'ve found out somehow about my dreams," Heric said. "They\'ll put\r\nme through the adjuster and I\'ll come out of it--someone else. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
I won\'t\r\ngo!"\r\n\r\nHe was a mild man, overseer of the cereal grain fields outside Nyark\r\nthe first city, holding the confidence of his superiors and the respect\r\nof his workers. He and Marta had been happy in the quiet eddy of their\r\nisolation, until the dreams came.\r\n\r\nThe patrolman took a gleaming silver shock-cone from his belt. "I am\r\nsorry, Arnol Heric. You must come with me."\r\n\r\nStark panic made Heric drop his book and strike out wildly, smashing a\r\nfist into the officer\'s face. The patrolman staggered back, teetered\r\nfor balance on the veranda\'s edge and fell heavily. The sound of his\r\nhead striking the stone walkway below was as definite as the thud of a\r\ndropped melon.\r\n\r\nHeric went down the steps and knelt to feel the man\'s limp wrist. There\r\nwas no pulse. He put an ear to the slack lips, and there was no breath.\r\nShock numbed him and drove his thoughts into strange, tortured channels.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve killed him," he said.\r\n\r\nA sound caught his ear and he looked up to see Marta on the dark\r\nveranda above him, her face a pale oval blur with enormous,\r\nfright-widened eyes. "I didn\'t intend this to happen, Marta. I--I lost\r\nmy head."\r\n\r\nShe came down at once and put a soft hand on his shoulder. "Of course,\r\nof course, darling. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Here, let me help you."\r\n\r\nTogether they lifted the patrolman\'s body into the copter\'s control\r\nseat, where it lolled bonelessly against the instrument panel. Heric\r\ntouched a button and the machine rose and soared eastward on a random\r\ncourse away from Nyark the first city.\r\n\r\nThey watched, holding hands like uneasy children, until it was lost\r\nagainst the stars. Then they went inside to the light and warmth of\r\ntheir cottage.\r\n\r\nHeric voiced the thought first: "They\'ll send for me again tomorrow,\r\nwhen he doesn\'t return."\r\n\r\nHe had again the ominous sensation, felt a dozen times in as many days,\r\nof being very close to understanding the strange auguries that had so\r\ntroubled his sleep of late. For a moment he hovered on the brink of\r\ncomplete comprehension before his fearful thought recoiled, leaving him\r\nuneasy and bewildered.\r\n\r\nWhen he slept the dream came more strongly than before.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The sere globe of Earth spun below him, frightfully riven by the\r\nhalf-healed wounds of some ancient cataclysm. Dull seas steamed and\r\nrain fell and vegetation crept across the scars, but there was life in\r\none place only._\r\n\r\n_There was a ruined city like a forest of standing shards, rising stark\r\nand cold against a desolate sky. A horde of silent figures poured\r\nthrough its streets, bent upon a myriad errands whose purposes he might\r\nhave guessed but dared not--he found himself one of the throng, yet his\r\ndread of understanding hid their intent as a mist might have obscured\r\ntheir faces. The crowd moved always eastward, its thousand faces rapt\r\nin impossible ecstasy. His own expectancy mounted to an unbearable\r\npitch, stifling him with the promise of total understanding. He had\r\nonly to follow them and--_\r\n\r\nHe awoke to find himself crouched on the cold floor of his bedroom,\r\ndrenched with perspiration and trembling violently from the strain of\r\nfighting back the monstrous concept toward which his dream had carried\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nMarta\'s voice was urgent in his ears. Marta\'s hands tugged at his arm,\r\nher breath was warm on his damp face. "Arnol, wake up! _Arnol!_"\r\n\r\nFor an instant he had an indescribable sense of being infinitely\r\nmultiplied, as if this moment were reproduced forever, a single frame\r\nin a succession that stretched endlessly before and behind him. Then\r\nthe dream tilted and swept away and he let Marta lead him, unresisting,\r\nback to bed.\r\n\r\nFor a long time he lay shivering in the darkness, his face hidden\r\nagainst her warm shoulder. And at last, when the tension had gone out\r\nof him, he slept again.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey came for him at daybreak, four burly patrolmen with Council\r\ninsignia on their helmets and silver shock-cones in their hands. Heric\r\nlooked back as he entered their copter to see Marta on the verandah,\r\nlovely in the soft disarray of her too-early rising, her eyes bright\r\nand blind with unshed tears.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll come back," he called. "It\'s going to be all right!"\r\n\r\nWhen the copter rose he waved at her, buoyed up unexpectedly by the\r\nring of certainty he had managed to force into his voice. He had a\r\nlast glimpse of Marta before distance and the morning mists hid her, a\r\nsmall, forlorn figure with raised face staring after him, her belted\r\nhouse-robe fluttering in the wind.\r\n\r\nThey sank through the ordered vastness of Nyark the first city, into\r\na bustle and rush that was symbolic of the Council\'s will to restore\r\nNyark--and finally Earth--to their former glory. Heric was led to a\r\nquiet chamber where the Council, in their deep crescent of seats behind\r\nthe Leader\'s throne, awaited him.\r\n\r\nHe had seen them before only in newscasts, when it had awed him a\r\nlittle to think that in their hands lay the destiny of a world in\r\nrebirth. He was surprised now to feel that their wrinkled parchment\r\nfaces and thin bodies, hidden under sleeveless blue robes, lent them a\r\nfutile anonymity rather than the distinction he had expected. _Why_, he\r\nthought, _they look like scrawny, earthbound birds._\r\n\r\n"Why am I here?" Heric demanded. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Rebellion grew in him, roughening his\r\nvoice. "I have broken no law, nor have I been lax in my overseeing. I\r\nprotest this adjustment to what you call normalcy."\r\n\r\n"Yet you must endure it, Arnol Heric," the Leader said. A rustle of\r\nassent whispered through the robed Council. "You should not have defied\r\nour messenger. It may be too late now."\r\n\r\nAnger swelled Heric\'s demand. "What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: He felt the breath of madness touch him....]\r\n\r\nHis answer was a great, cloudy bubble that sprang from nowhere about\r\nhim. The Council vanished behind its milky haze. There was a brief\r\nsensation of motion, and after that--nothing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_He was in the void of his dreams again, imprisoned in darkness.\r\nBut there was a difference--the dull globe of Earth spun faint and\r\nmisty, half-seen through an obscuring curtain. A smooth, hypnotic\r\nthought-current flowed into his mind from the adjuster, commanding him,\r\nwarring with the half-sensed truth that still sought his awareness._\r\n\r\n_"You are Arnol Heric, overseer of cereal plantings. You have had\r\nno disturbing dreams. Forget, Arnol Heric. There is no need for\r\nalarm...."_\r\n\r\n_There was a long struggle before his will fought clear, and he knew\r\nthat the Leader\'s fear of being too late had been realized. The pitted\r\nEarth-sphere grew plain, the desolate city sharpened and drew near. He\r\nwalked the thronged streets and turned his face toward the east, and\r\nthis time he did not repulse the truth when it lay before him._\r\n\r\n_There was a silent room where a figure reclined laxly in a chair made\r\nmassive by its crystal maze of shining coils. Two guards flanked the\r\nchair watchfully, and in it sat--_\r\n\r\n_Himself._\r\n\r\nAnger shook him like a terrible wind, without warning. It was all a\r\nmonstrous farce, then--he was the center of it all, and they had hidden\r\nhim in his overseer\'s niche to blind him to reality.\r\n\r\nHe opened his eyes in the adjuster, pushing the futile thought-current\r\nfrom his mind. The guards stiffened at his movement, their silver\r\nshock-cones ready.\r\n\r\n"I know myself now," Heric said. He stood up, shaking off the web of\r\ncrystal contacts from the adjuster. "And I know you. Put away your\r\nuseless weapons."\r\n\r\nThey dropped their cones and stood with lowered eyes, waiting his\r\npleasure with a deference that made his lip curl. He left the room\r\nwithout a backward look, knowing they would warn the Council but having\r\nno need now for secrecy.\r\n\r\nHe went down a wide-arched corridor, striding with sure step to the\r\ncity\'s heart. He found the power source at ground level, in a vast\r\ndim cavern full of soft-purring machines. He singled out the great\r\noperations board with its master switch that controlled the city\'s\r\nlife--and in his path he found the Leader and his council, shielding\r\nthe control from him with the massed crescent of their bodies.\r\n\r\n"Stand back," Heric commanded.\r\n\r\nThe Council stirred uneasily, but did not break.\r\n\r\n"Hear us out, Arnol Heric," the Leader begged. "Remember that we, being\r\nnot-human, yet have human emotions. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
We are the end result of the robot\r\nrace men created to serve them in ages past, and you are right when\r\nyou suppose that we may not defy you because we are your property. But\r\nthere is a thing which you do not know, hidden from you even in your\r\ndreams for your own safety. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Stay your hand, Master."\r\n\r\nThe sound of Heric\'s laughter echoed emptily through the vast room.\r\n\r\n"Stay my hand and let you adjust me into submission again? Let you send\r\nme back to planting wheat, drowning my identity in ignorance? I know\r\nthe human race is almost dead--I know that you hide the truth from the\r\nfew of us who remain because you think us doomed to extinction. You\r\nwould bury us in ignorance and rule in our stead as if you were men and\r\nwe your servants."\r\n\r\n"_We_ are the servants," the Leader said. "Yet you would immobilize us.\r\nWhy?"\r\n\r\n"Because I would rather know my fate and meet it without your\r\nmeddling," Heric answered. "Because I do not believe that my race\r\ncan ever die completely. I shall stop you in your tracks like the\r\nmechanical things you are, and I shall find the others of my people who\r\nare left and start life over with them. And this time we shall know\r\nbetter than to build machines!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"We have no desire to perpetuate ourselves," the Leader said. "We were\r\ncreated to serve humanity, and to insure our obedience to the love\r\nof men was made our strongest instinct. Without men our life would be\r\nan endless torture of loneliness, for we can be happy only in your\r\nhappiness. We hid the truth from you, and kept you busy outside Nyark\r\nthe first city, to protect your sanity."\r\n\r\nHeric took a forward step. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
"Back, all of you!"\r\n\r\nThey drew aside to let him pass. The Leader knelt as Heric brushed by\r\nhim, and the Council knelt with averted faces behind him. Their sigh\r\nwhispered through the great room.\r\n\r\n"Wait, Arnol Heric. Do you know that we have made you immortal?"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "Wait, Arnol Heric. Do you know that we have made you\r\nimmortal?"]\r\n\r\nHe paused with his hands upon the master control, disturbed by a\r\nresurgence of that indescribable extension he had felt on waking from\r\nhis dream. Angrily he shook it off, bracing himself.\r\n\r\nHe wrenched open the switch.\r\n\r\nThe machine-murmur died. The cavernous chamber stilled until Heric\'s\r\nheart beat loud in the tomblike silence. The Council knelt motionless,\r\nlike even rows of cold statuary.\r\n\r\nHe turned from them and went through the hushed room and out into the\r\nstreets of Nyark the first city. Silence lay before him. Vehicles stood\r\nunpowered, drivers frozen. In the shops the crowds hovered motionless\r\nlike static, three-dimensional shadows.\r\n\r\nHe went swiftly through the dead city with his face turned toward the\r\nhills. The silence bore him down with an implacable weight, and the\r\ndesire to escape it grew upon him until he found himself running,\r\ndodging wildly in and out among stalled vehicles and frozen pedestrians.\r\n\r\nHe reached the city\'s edge, but the sun and wind of open country did\r\nnot dispel his oppression. The sun was as silent as the city, and the\r\nbreeze was a drear lament in his ears. Loneliness crept at his heels\r\nlike a black, timorous hound; he felt as if he were the only living\r\nthing in a dead and forgotten world. Panic claimed him.\r\n\r\nIt was noon when he reached his cottage. He crawled up the verandah\r\nsteps, spent and panting, and found the silence with him here even in\r\nhis last retreat.\r\n\r\n"Marta!" he croaked. He pulled himself erect, clutching at the arched\r\ndoorway for support.\r\n\r\n"Marta!"\r\n\r\nHe had been so sure that there would be other men. He had been able to\r\nfend off madness back there on the plain, only because he had known\r\nthat Marta was here waiting for him....\r\n\r\nHe found her standing in the silent living room, her still face turned\r\ntoward the door through which he must come when he returned. She wore\r\nthe clinging, colorful gown he had liked best, and her bright, fair\r\nhair was carefully arranged as if she were on the point of going out.\r\n\r\nHer lashes were lowered as if in sleep, and he had the instant\r\nconviction that she had closed her lids to hide the mechanical luster\r\nof her eyes from him when he should come and find her.\r\n\r\n"_Marta_," he whispered.\r\n\r\nHe sagged against the entrance arch, with the bitter sound of the\r\nLeader\'s words in his ears: "We can be happy only in your happiness...."\r\n\r\nNot one of them was human, not even Marta. He was the last man on Earth.\r\n\r\nAnd he was immortal.\r\n\r\nThis was the thing that had been hidden from him even in his dream,\r\nlest he go mad. This silence that pressed him down was the silence of\r\neternity.\r\n\r\nHe was alone in a world of death and dust, and would be alone forever.\r\n\r\nHe felt the breath of madness touch him. He heard the Council\'s sighing\r\nwhisper of "_Immortal_ ..." and he recalled the eerie sensation of\r\ninfinite multiplication that had come to him when he pulled open the\r\nmaster switch.\r\n\r\nHe thought: _How many times has this happened? And how many times will\r\nit happen again?_\r\n\r\nWhen he spoke, he used unconsciously the same words he had used when he\r\nleft her at daybreak.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll come back, Marta," he said. "It\'s going to be all right."\r\n\r\nThen he went outside and turned his face toward the silent city and\r\nbegan to run....\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
