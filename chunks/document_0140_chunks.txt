"All right, cut the power. We ought to be safe enough here."\r\n\r\nAs he released the intercom, Dr. Leicher, of the astronomical staff,\r\nstepped up to his side. "Perfectly safe," he nodded, "although even at\r\nthis distance a star going nova ought to be quite a display."\r\n\r\nBenedict didn\'t shift his gaze from the plate. "Do you have your\r\ninstruments set up?"\r\n\r\n"Not quite. But we have plenty of time. The light won\'t reach us for\r\nseveral hours yet. Remember, we were outracing it at ten lights."\r\n\r\nThe commander finally turned, slowly letting his breath out in a soft\r\nsigh. "Dr. Leicher, I would say that this is just about the foulest\r\ncoincidence that could happen to the first interstellar vessel ever to\r\nleave the Solar System."\r\n\r\nLeicher shrugged. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
"In one way of thinking, yes. It is certainly true\r\nthat we will never know, now, whether Alpha Centauri A ever had any\r\nplanets. But, in another way, it is extremely fortunate that we should\r\nbe so near a stellar explosion because of the wealth of scientific\r\ninformation we can obtain. As you say, it is a coincidence, and\r\nprobably one that happens only once in a billion years. The chances of\r\nany particular star going nova are small. That we should be so close\r\nwhen it happens is of a vanishingly small order of probability."\r\n\r\nCommander Benedict took off his cap and looked at the damp stain in the\r\nsweatband. "Nevertheless, Doctor, it is damned unnerving to come out of\r\nultradrive a couple of hundred million miles from the first star ever\r\nvisited by man and have to turn tail and run because the damned thing\r\npractically blows up in your face."\r\n\r\nLeicher could see that Benedict was upset; he rarely used the same\r\nprofanity twice in one sentence.\r\n\r\nThey had been downright lucky, at that. If Leicher hadn\'t seen the star\r\nbegin to swell and brighten, if he hadn\'t known what it meant, or if\r\nCommander Benedict hadn\'t been quick enough in shifting the ship back\r\ninto ultradrive--Leicher had a vision of an incandescent cloud of\r\ngaseous metal that had once been a spaceship.\r\n\r\nThe intercom buzzed. The commander answered, "Yes?"\r\n\r\n"Sir, would you tell Dr. Leicher that we have everything set up now?"\r\n\r\nLeicher nodded and turned to leave. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
"I guess we have nothing to do now\r\nbut wait."\r\n\r\nWhen the light from the nova did come, Commander Benedict was back at\r\nthe plate again--the forward one, this time, since the ship had been\r\nturned around in order to align the astronomy lab in the nose with the\r\nstar.\r\n\r\nAlpha Centauri A began to brighten and spread. It made Benedict think\r\nof a light bulb connected through a rheostat, with someone turning that\r\nrheostat, turning it until the circuit was well overloaded.\r\n\r\nThe light began to hurt Benedict\'s eyes even at that distance and he\r\nhad to cut down the receptivity in order to watch. After a while, he\r\nturned away from the plate. Not because the show was over, but simply\r\nbecause it had slowed to a point beyond which no change seemed to take\r\nplace to the human eye.\r\n\r\nFive weeks later, much to Leicher\'s chagrin, Commander Benedict\r\nannounced that they had to leave the vicinity. The ship had only been\r\nprovisioned to go to Alpha Centauri, scout the system without landing\r\non any of the planets, and return. At ten lights, top speed for the\r\nultradrive, it would take better than three months to get back.\r\n\r\n"I know you\'d like to watch it go through the complete cycle," Benedict\r\nsaid, "but we can\'t go back home as a bunch of starved skeletons."\r\n\r\nLeicher resigned himself to the necessity of leaving much of his work\r\nunfinished, and, although he knew it was a case of sour grapes,\r\nconsoled himself with the thought that he could as least get most of\r\nthe remaining information from the five-hundred-inch telescope on Luna,\r\nfour years from then.\r\n\r\nAs the ship slipped into the not-quite-space through which the\r\nultradrive propelled it, Leicher began to consolidate the material he\r\nhad already gathered.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCommander Benedict wrote in the log:\r\n\r\n_Fifty-four days out from Sol. Alpha Centauri has long since faded back\r\ninto its pre-blowup state, since we have far outdistanced the light\r\nfrom its explosion. It now looks as it did two years ago. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
It_--\r\n\r\n"Pardon me, Commander," Leicher interrupted, "But I have something\r\ninteresting to show you."\r\n\r\nBenedict took his fingers off the keys and turned around in his chair.\r\n"What is it, Doctor?"\r\n\r\nLeicher frowned at the papers in his hands. "I\'ve been doing some work\r\non the probability of that explosion happening just as it did, and I\'ve\r\ncome up with some rather frightening figures. As I said before, the\r\nprobability was small. A little calculation has given us some\r\ninformation which makes it even smaller. For instance: with a possible\r\nerror of plus or minus two seconds Alpha Centauri A began to explode\r\nthe instant we came out of ultradrive!\r\n\r\n"Now, the probability of that occurring comes out so small that it\r\nshould happen only once in ten to the four hundred sixty-seventh\r\nseconds."\r\n\r\nIt was Commander Benedict\'s turn to frown. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
"So?"\r\n\r\n"Commander, the entire universe is only about ten to the seventeenth\r\nseconds old. But to give you an idea, let\'s say that the chances of its\r\nhappening are _once_ in millions of trillions of years!"\r\n\r\nBenedict blinked. The number, he realized, was totally beyond his\r\ncomprehension--or anyone else\'s.\r\n\r\n"Well, so what? Now it has happened that one time. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
That simply means\r\nthat it will almost certainly never happen again!"\r\n\r\n"True. But, Commander, when you buck odds like that and win, the thing\r\nto do is look for some factor that is cheating in your favor. If you\r\ntook a pair of dice and started throwing sevens, one right after\r\nanother--_for the next couple of thousand years_--you\'d begin to\r\nsuspect they were loaded."\r\n\r\nBenedict said nothing; he just waited expectantly.\r\n\r\n"There is only one thing that could have done it. Our ship." Leicher\r\nsaid it quietly, without emphasis.\r\n\r\n"What we know about the hyperspace, or superspace, or whatever it is we\r\nmove through in ultradrive is almost nothing. Coming out of it so near\r\nto a star might set up some sort of shock wave in normal space which\r\nwould completely disrupt that star\'s internal balance, resulting in the\r\nliberation of unimaginably vast amounts of energy, causing that star to\r\ngo nova. We can only assume that we ourselves were the fuze that set\r\noff that nova."\r\n\r\nBenedict stood up slowly. When he spoke, his voice was a choking\r\nwhisper. "You mean the sun--Sol--might...."\r\n\r\nLeicher nodded. "I don\'t say that it definitely would. But the\r\nprobability is that we were the cause of the destruction of Alpha\r\nCentauri A, and therefore might cause the destruction of Sol in the\r\nsame way."\r\n\r\nBenedict\'s voice was steady again. "That means that we can\'t go back\r\nagain, doesn\'t it? Even if we\'re not positive, we can\'t take the\r\nchance."\r\n\r\n"Not necessarily. We can get fairly close before we cut out the drive,\r\nand come in the rest of the way at sub-light speed. It\'ll take longer,\r\nand we\'ll have to go on half or one-third rations, but we _can_ do it!"\r\n\r\n"How far away?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what the minimum distance is, but I do know how we can\r\ngage a distance. Remember, neither Alpha Centauri B or C were\r\ndetonated. We\'ll have to cut our drive at least as far away from Sol\r\nas they are from A."\r\n\r\n"I see." The commander was silent for a moment, then: "Very well, Dr.\r\nLeicher. If that\'s the safest way, that\'s the only way."\r\n\r\nBenedict issued the orders, while Leicher figured the exact point at\r\nwhich they must cut out the drive, and how long the trip would take.\r\nThe rations would have to be cut down accordingly.\r\n\r\nCommander Benedict\'s mind whirled around the monstrousness of the whole\r\nthing like some dizzy bee around a flower. What if there had been\r\nplanets around Centauri A? What if they had been inhabited? Had he, all\r\nunwittingly, killed entire races of living, intelligent beings?\r\n\r\nBut, how could he have known? The drive had never been tested before.\r\nIt couldn\'t be tested inside the Solar System--it was too fast. He and\r\nhis crew had been volunteers, knowing that they might die when the\r\ndrive went on.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, Benedict gasped and slammed his fist down on the desk before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nLeicher looked up. "What\'s the matter, Commander?"\r\n\r\n"Suppose," came the answer, "Just suppose, that we have the same\r\neffect on a star when we _go into_ ultradrive as we do when we come\r\nout of it?"\r\n\r\nLeicher was silent for a moment, stunned by the possibility. There was\r\nnothing to say, anyway. They could only wait....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA little more than half a light year from Sol, when the ship reached\r\nthe point where its occupants could see the light that had left their\r\nhome sun more than seven months before, they watched it become\r\nsuddenly, horribly brighter. _A hundred thousand times brighter!_\r\n\r\n...
