=== Chunk 2 ===
]\r\n\r\n\r\nClouds hung low over the city, gray and dismal. The shining metal\r\nthruway partially reflected their somber visage. A few vehicles\r\nscurried nervously through the city.\r\n\r\nKeller turned away from the window dismally. His conscience was\r\nbothering him, and it affected his every movement. Looking over his\r\nhumbly furnished office, he entertained the thought, not for the first\r\ntime, that he should change jobs if he wanted to eat.\r\n\r\nA buzz sounded--the intercom system. That would be Sally, his\r\nsecretary. It was a mystery what she would want. Usually she never\r\nbothered him except in case of an emergency, and the last client Keller\r\nhad had dropped his case three months ago.\r\n\r\nApparently it was another customer, unlikely as it seemed. Keller\r\nheard voices outside, Sally\'s irritated and protesting, and a nervous\r\nbaritone. Abruptly the door opened, disclosing a rugged, bushy-haired\r\nC-3 (average intelligence and advanced extra-sensory perception, but\r\nunexercised), who was in a bad state of nerves.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to have forced his way past Sally into the inner office.\r\n\r\nKeller flashed a thought at Sally: **How does he look?**\r\n\r\n**Not so hot,** she answered. **I didn\'t bother to scan much--don\'t\r\nwant to lower myself to that depth--but he seems to be a big payer.\r\nHe\'s impatient, though. And he wants everything run his way.**\r\n\r\nOh, fine, thought Keller. My first victim in three months, and it has\r\nto be the Big Shot type.\r\n\r\nHe made the usual Q-R opening; curtly and efficiently:\r\n\r\n"Your name?"\r\n\r\n"Uh--Harold Radcliffe."\r\n\r\n"Why the hesitation?" But Keller had scanned it already. The man was\r\nsimply cautious. He continued without letting Radcliffe answer:\r\n\r\n"Age?" 33. "Occupation?" Hesitation: Salesman. "Residence?" After\r\nwriting this and Radcliffe\'s telephone number down, he closed his grimy\r\nblack notebook and sat back.\r\n\r\n"And now, Mr. Radcliffe, why exactly did you come here?"\r\n\r\nRadcliffe, unsure of himself at first, gathered confidence as he\r\nnoticed Keller\'s interest growing. He began:\r\n\r\n"Well sir, for this job I need one of the best detectives--" he paused\r\nat Keller\'s grimace--"and since you\'re one of the few detectives in\r\nthe city who can read minds, and the only A-2 \'tec in the state--" He\r\nshrugged, and finished, "I figured you\'d be the man for me."\r\n\r\nKeller saw that he was telling the truth, after a quick check into the\r\nman\'s mind. "All right, Mr. Radcliffe. What\'s your problem?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRadcliffe seemed to not be able to focus his thoughts. His mind, Keller\r\nsaw, was a loose stream of unconnected thoughts, trying to merge into\r\na whole. Keller could read no message out of them. He suspected a\r\nblock--an unusual thing for a C-3, but not impossible.\r\n\r\nHe gave up, sat back and awaited the other\'s response. Finally it came,\r\njerking Keller out of his chair.\r\n\r\n"It\'s murder, Mr. Keller. The murder of my wife."\r\n\r\nMurder!\r\n\r\nIt was the first suspected murder in thirteen years. Ever since the\r\nRicjards case in \'04, peace and tranquility reigned in a calm and\r\nplacid nation. For thirteen peaceful years there had been no hint\r\nof manslaughter other than accidental. It had been conditioned out\r\nof humans at the prenatal stage, and unless there was a violent,\r\nall-encompassing urge to kill, murder was completely out of the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nIt was hard to believe. But it was not a lie; no non-tele could block a\r\nlie, and Keller scanned the truth in Radcliffe\'s brain.\r\n\r\n"Wait a minute, Radcliffe. Are you sure it\'s not murder by\r\naccident--unintentional manslaughter, as the police term it? Or it\r\ncould be suicide. Had you thought of that?"\r\n\r\nRadcliffe shook his head impatiently. He rose out of his chair, pacing\r\nthe floor nervously. "It could not possibly be accident. You\'ll see\r\nthat when you investigate the case. Suicide? It\'s possible. Anything\r\nis possible, I suppose, but I would lay any kind of odds against it.\r\nWe had just been to the theater. We returned to our apartment at about\r\nfive minutes to eleven.\r\n\r\n"After undressing and showering, I started to turn in. I noticed a\r\nlight on in her room--we sleep in separate rooms--and called to her, to\r\nsee if anything was wrong. There was no answer.\r\n\r\n"I figured that she had gone to sleep with the light on, and went into\r\nthe room to turn it off. That was when I saw her on the floor." 

=== Chunk 3 ===
He\r\nstopped. Keller read grief, fear and love in his memory.\r\n\r\n"How had she been killed?"\r\n\r\n"It was a handgun, Mr. Keller. Her face was all blackened and charred.\r\nBarely recognizable. But I knew it must be her. Our rooms connect, you\r\nsee. There are two other doors to each room; one to the outside hall,\r\nand one to each bathroom.\r\n\r\n"When she was shot, my door was locked on the inside--triple-locked,\r\nI remember, because I felt like being left alone that night. It was\r\nlocked by chain, bar and bolt. It\'s a fairly ancient apartment house.\r\nWe like it that way. Her bathroom door was open and there was no one\r\nhiding inside. The same went for my bathroom. And both hall doors were\r\nlocked and bolted.\r\n\r\n"The windows were locked on the inside, and there is no opening to\r\nshoot through that would not leave traces. I checked.\r\n\r\n"Even if the killer had gotten in some way or other, there was no way\r\nhe could get out and still leave the doors and windows locked up tight."\r\n\r\nKeller thought, there is one way, Mr. Radcliffe. But he kept it to\r\nhimself for the moment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe looked up and smiled as confidently as he could. "I\'ll be glad\r\nto take your case, Mr. Radcliffe. Of course you want me to spare no\r\nexpenses," he added hopefully. At Radcliffe\'s harassed nod, he relaxed.\r\n\r\nNext came the most dangerous part of the job. It was a part which had\r\neliminated several competent detectives from their jobs--the Probe\r\nphase. This involved plunging into the subject\'s mind, and sorting out\r\nrelevant details which could furnish extra clues. Several Probers had\r\ngot themselves trapped in the subject\'s mind, unable to get out because\r\nof a mental block or insanity.\r\n\r\nIt might, however, be unnecessary. He flashed a thought to the girl in\r\nthe adjoining room: **Sal, should I give him the H-R treatment?**\r\n\r\nAnswer: **Emphatically! He\'s hiding something. Not intentionally, but\r\nit needs to be uncovered. A superficial scanning of the preconscious\r\ndoesn\'t get the job done.**\r\n\r\nKeller sighed. The Probe (also called the H-R treatment, because a\r\ncertain amount of hypnotism was involved) was trying on not only the\r\nsubject but also the scanner. He said:\r\n\r\n"Now, Mr. Radcliffe, I\'m going to go into your subconscious mind and\r\nget your impressions of last night. I want you to concentrate on ...\r\nlet\'s say ... the moment when you saw your wife." He shut off all of\r\nhis five senses, and took the plunge.\r\n\r\nThe image formed:\r\n\r\nShrieking terror. A tinge of ozone in the air. The Creature creeping\r\nup from behind. A beheaded teddy bear lying full length on the floor.\r\nA hole in the air near the door, colored red. Floating demon--where?\r\nNonononono! The Creature bending over him. Terror--heat. No! THE MAN\r\nWHO FLEW. Melting walls. The door (now violet) disintegrating. The\r\nteddy bear shriveling now--turns into a snake--\r\n\r\nHe emerged.\r\n\r\nBefore he could take full control of his body, a thought came:\r\n\r\n**Rick? How did you come out?**\r\n\r\nHe flashed her the image. **Lousy. I can\'t get a true\r\nimpression-picture to save my life. Just a lousy nightmare,\r\nfantasy-symbolism deal. But I did get something out of that mess. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
I\'ll\r\nlet you know about it as soon as I verify it.**\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo Radcliffe, since the time when Keller had stopped talking until\r\nright now, as Keller opened his eyes and frowned in thought, no\r\ntime had elapsed. In actuality, the time taken was one and one-half\r\nmicroseconds.\r\n\r\nKeller flashed: **Sally, tune in on this conversation, please.**\r\n\r\n"Radcliffe," he said slowly, "When did you lose your sight?"\r\n\r\nThe other man sat up rigidly, then relaxed.\r\n\r\n"How did you find out? Did you scan it?"\r\n\r\n"No. When I was receiving your impressions, I caught an idea of melting\r\nwalls. Then there were nameless creatures and demons floating around. I\r\nexamined your senses when I came out, and saw that you were blind. What\r\nis it--sort of a sight perception-tuning sense?"\r\n\r\nRadcliffe nodded. "I can sense everything except colors. Everything\r\nseems black, white and gray to me." He paused wearily. "Otherwise,\r\nthere\'s no difference. No one else knew about it. Not even my wife."\r\n\r\nKeller nodded. "Now, let\'s try it again. Concentrate on the moment when\r\nyou entered here and saw me for the first time."\r\n\r\nHe flashed a thought to Sally. **Those Creatures were his fear of the\r\nunknown. He\'s got a lot of fright in there. Probably afraid that the\r\nkiller would jump out at him from some shadowy corner. I don\'t quite\r\nsee how he could visualize different colors, having never seen them\r\nbefore--but that\'s probably my interpretation of them. Here goes.

=== Chunk 5 ===
**\r\n\r\nThe image:\r\n\r\nHeat. Light. The teddy bear rising up again. Fear. THE MAN WHO FLEW.\r\nThe snake again--coiling--striking--missing. Fleeing. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Dying. Melting\r\nwalls. Voices around him--laughing--shrieking. Colors of the rainbow.\r\nThe creature dying--dead--dissolving. No more....\r\n\r\nVoices again. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Talking to him. Telling him--what? His life flashing\r\nbefore him--stopping. His brain--_undressing_? Hole in the air\r\nat--the desk? Fear. THE MAN WHO FLEW. Fear-terror-hate-revenge ...\r\ndetermination....\r\n\r\n**Sally? Did you catch all that mess?**\r\n\r\n**Unfortunately.**\r\n\r\n**Something\'s wrong, Sally. I should be seeing something akin to the\r\nactual events through his eyes. Instead all I get is this meaningless\r\nstuff--unless--oh, God, now I see!** Pause. **I wonder who the Man Who\r\nFlew is?**\r\n\r\n**You\'ve got me. And how about the dissolving creature?**\r\n\r\n**That shows his confidence in having someone to tell his story to. All\r\nhis unknown fear is vanishing.**\r\n\r\n**And then there\'s the hole in the air.**\r\n\r\n**Yeah. I think I\'ll surface again, and try some straight questions on\r\nhim.**\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Radcliffe," began Keller, "you haven\'t reported this to the police,\r\nhave you?"\r\n\r\nRadcliffe grinned. "Hardly. That would start the biggest scandal in\r\nyears. I want it kept quiet until we found out who killed her."\r\n\r\n"Well, we\'ve ruled out accidental murder. You found no handgun in the\r\nroom when you searched it?"\r\n\r\n"No firearm of any kind."\r\n\r\nKeller nodded. He let his mind drift back over four years--\r\n\r\nTo a time when he was in love with Mildred Simmons and had proposed to\r\nher ... and she had rejected him, saying she loved Harold Radcliffe.\r\n\r\nHe had walked away, a bitter man. She had had many enemies, he mused,\r\nand almost as many friends. He did not know of anyone who knew her who\r\nwas not either violently for or violently against her and all that she\r\nstood for.\r\n\r\nHe looked up.\r\n\r\n"How old was your wife when she died?"\r\n\r\n"Thirty-one. Two years younger than I am."\r\n\r\n"Do you know of anyone who would want to kill her?" It was a routine\r\nquestion, but to Keller it was very important.\r\n\r\n"No. I knew many people who disliked her intensely--I\'m not denying\r\nthat--but not to the point of murder. Of course, she wasn\'t around me\r\nhalf the time. I might not know."\r\n\r\n"Well, Radcliffe, I think that\'ll be all for today. Mind if I go with\r\nyou back to your apartment to look it over?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t live there any more. I moved out after I had disposed of her\r\nbody. I couldn\'t stand to live there any longer."\r\n\r\nRadcliffe shook hands and departed. Keller read confidence and\r\npositiveness that he, Keller, would come through. Keller was not so\r\nsure. He decided to have a look around Radcliffe\'s apartment.\r\n\r\nHe strolled aimlessly around the apartment for a few moments, pausing\r\nhere and there to check details which might or might not help him in\r\nanalyzing the Radcliffes\' character: furniture design, carpeting,\r\nthermostat setting, toilet articles and so on. Then he got down to a\r\nthorough examination of the room.\r\n\r\nThere were no secret panels or trapdoors of any kind. So entrance by a\r\nhithertofore unknown passageway was completely out. He checked the air\r\nconditioner to see if any rigmarole could be fixed up with it to make\r\nit appear that the victim had been shot with a handgun, but this, too,\r\ndrew a blank.\r\n\r\nAfter a few more minutes\' examination, he decided to return.\r\n\r\nOn an impulse, he decided to see where Radcliffe had gone. Attuning his\r\nmind to the already-recorded pattern of Radcliffe\'s brain, he received\r\ndirection, distance and motion--acceleration, direction, rate.\r\n\r\nTo his surprise he noted that Radcliffe had turned back and was heading\r\ntoward Keller\'s office again.\r\n\r\nHastily, Keller returned to the office before him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn about twenty minutes, Radcliffe barged in as before. "Keller," he\r\nsaid, "I think I\'m going to be called out of town tonight. So if you\r\nwant any more information directly from me, you\'ll have to get it now."\r\n\r\nKeller flashed: **Sally. Watch his conscious thoughts, and also his\r\nimpressions. I\'m going to try some unconscious identification-response.\r\nWish me luck. Or do you want to burrow around in his subconscious with\r\nme a little more?**\r\n\r\n**I think I will. I\'m actually beginning to enjoy it, to tell the\r\ntruth.**\r\n\r\nKeller said aloud, "I\'ll go under again. That\'ll be the last time."\r\n\r\nImage:\r\n\r\nNonono. Fire. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
Flame. Gun. Fearhateterrorlove.\r\n\r\n**Radcliffe, I am the creature.**\r\n\r\nNo! Dead. You\'re not--I hate you--gone. Disbelief. Hate. No fear.\r\nForgetfulness. Block. Withdrawal.\r\n\r\n**Radcliffe.**\r\n\r\nMe.\r\n\r\n**I\'m the melting walls.**\r\n\r\nTerror? Uncertainty. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
Indecision. Realization. Contemptpityscorn. Sharp\r\nmental block. Withdrawal.\r\n\r\n**Radcliffe.**\r\n\r\nMe.\r\n\r\n**I\'m the teddy bear.** (This was, he thought, Radcliffe\'s wife-image.)\r\n\r\nIndecision. Realization. Withdrawal. Blank.\r\n\r\n**Radcliffe, I\'m the hole in the air.**\r\n\r\nBut Keller\'s reply was cut short by a cry of terror in his brain.\r\n\r\n**RICK!**\r\n\r\nIt was Sally.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKeller went down immediately.\r\n\r\n**What?** No response. **WHAT?

=== Chunk 10 ===
** Still no response. Then he could hear\r\nher cry--fading in depth--now dying--gone.\r\n\r\n**Radcliffe.**\r\n\r\nMememe.\r\n\r\n**Sally.**\r\n\r\nMemeususwetwowetwo....\r\n\r\nIt had happened. Sally was trapped in his preconscious, absorbed by\r\nhis dominating mind block. Gone.\r\n\r\nForever.\r\n\r\nDetermination, savage and enraged. A desperate shot in the dark:\r\n\r\n**RADCLIFFE!**\r\n\r\nMememememememe....\r\n\r\n**Radcliffe, I am the MAN WHO FLEW.**\r\n\r\nNononono. Fear. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
Terror. Hate. 

=== Chunk 12 ===
Block. Withdrawal, but incomplete....\r\n\r\nComing out of his Probe, Keller saw the result of his last implanted\r\nthought: Radcliffe, now in a tight fetal ball, lay on the floor.\r\n\r\nHis face was absolutely devoid of expression. His conscious mind was a\r\nconstant _gobble-gobble-gobble_.\r\n\r\nKeller entered the next room, to find Sally sprawled limply across\r\nher desk. Mindless, soulless, as if she had never had a mind or\r\nsoul--Keller lifted her tenderly onto the floor and chose the most\r\nmerciful way out, disintegrating her body with an atomic gun from the\r\ncloset.\r\n\r\nThen, again, the Probe....\r\n\r\n**Radcliffe.**\r\n\r\nMememe.\r\n\r\n**I\'m Sally.**\r\n\r\nNonono. (Gloating.) Gonegonegone.\r\n\r\n**Radcliffe, _where\'s Sally_?**\r\n\r\nGone. Satisfaction. 

=== Chunk 13 ===
Triumph. Laughter. Delirious happiness.\r\n\r\n**Radcliffe, I\'m everything. I\'m the creature. The snake, THE MAN WHO\r\nFLEW, the hole in the air, the flames, everything you\'ve hated, feared\r\nand dreaded.**\r\n\r\nWithdrawal. Thunderbolt! More and more now.\r\n\r\nFrantically, Keller defended himself, throwing up block after block,\r\nonly to have it torn down by the ever-spreading bolts of pure mental\r\nenergy. Finally he withdrew into his own body in haste, realizing that\r\nRadcliffe\'s conquest would mean his revival.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen he opened his eyes, Radcliffe was sitting in the chair, yawning.\r\n\r\nProbably, Keller thought, he had no knowledge of his fetal state. Good.\r\n"Well, Radcliffe," he said, "I need only one more thing to complete the\r\npicture. Now focus again on 11:17 last night, when you found your wife\r\ndead on the floor."\r\n\r\nImage:\r\n\r\nFear. Terror. 

=== Chunk 14 ===
Anxiety. Nonono. Hole in the air. THE MAN WHO FLEW. Pain.\r\nWithdrawal. Complete mental block.\r\n\r\nWith a shock, Keller realized that in seven hours Radcliffe had been\r\nturned into an A-3--just below Keller--thanks to ... Sally.\r\n\r\nHe analyzed the symbols. Impressions: No teddy bear (no real concern\r\nfor the wife, then). No creature (no more unknown fears). 

=== Chunk 15 ===
No snake or\r\ndemon or flames, signifying evil and terror. Just the hole in the air\r\nand the man who flew.\r\n\r\nStrange ... he realized that meant one thing--he had to go down one\r\nlast final time--to end it all....\r\n\r\n**Radcliffe.**\r\n\r\nMe.\r\n\r\n**Radcliffe, who is Sally?**\r\n\r\nMemeusususwetwowetwo.\r\n\r\n**Shut up! Radcliffe, I know who killed your wife.**\r\n\r\nTerror. Shock. 

=== Chunk 16 ===
Ordeal. Decision. Determination. 

=== Chunk 17 ===
Yes. We hear you.\r\n\r\n**THE MAN WHO FLEW RADCLIFFE! THE MAN WHO FLEW KILLED YOUR WIFE. THE\r\nHOLE IN THE AIR IS WHAT YOU SENSED--THE VACUUM THAT HE LEFT WHEN HE\r\nTELEPORTED HIMSELF OUT OF THE MELTING WALLS ARE, RADCLIFFE.
