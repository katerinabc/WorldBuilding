Haseltine_\r\n\r\n\r\nI was climbing the steep side of a central Wisconsin hill, holding my\r\nbow away from my body for balance, when I first saw the stranger. He sat\r\non a stump at the crest and watched me struggle up. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
As I drew nearer I\r\npanted out a greeting and received his cheerful "Hi" in return. When I\r\nfinally reached the top, I threw myself on the ground and began catching\r\nmy breath.\r\n\r\nHe didn\'t say anything at first, just looked at the bow and the quiver\r\nof arrows on my back. Finally he said, "May I look at it?" and reached\r\nfor the bow. I handed it to him. He examined it carefully and returned\r\nit.\r\n\r\n"Beautiful workmanship. Is that all you use?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I never cared much for guns," I answered. "I\'ve always thought a bow\r\ngave the animal more of an even chance for his life."\r\n\r\nWe talked then on the various aspects of hunting and how the crisp fall\r\nair seemed to make the deer seem closer than during the heat of summer.\r\nWhile we talked I tried to place the reason he disturbed me, but I\r\ncouldn\'t seem to do it. He was dressed in an old plaid shirt and\r\ndungarees and his blond hair wasn\'t many shades removed from my own\r\nstraw thatch. But there was something odd about him that I couldn\'t\r\nquite find.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it\'s the cloth." His words surprised me. "You see, it hasn\'t\r\nbeen discovered on this planet as yet." My face must have shown\r\nastonishment because he went on in the same vein. "I admit it\'s\r\nconfusing, but it\'s also true. My clothes weren\'t made on Earth." He\r\nchuckled then, deep in his throat. "I don\'t blame you for being\r\nconfused. I know how I would feel if I met an extraterrestrial being\r\nbefore space travel was a reality."\r\n\r\nI kept staring at him. Finally I blurted out, "What in Sam Hill are you\r\ntalking about?"\r\n\r\nHe leaned forward on the stump and his face grew earnest. "You might say\r\nI\'m a poll taker. I have to decide certain things from various\r\ninterviews with individuals I meet."\r\n\r\n"What are you trying to prove?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry, but I can\'t tell you that until I\'m finished with the\r\ninterview. If I told you, your interest in the subject would tend to\r\nprejudice your answers."\r\n\r\n"Fair enough. What do you want to ask me?"\r\n\r\nHe pulled out a notebook and smiled. "These questions may seem a little\r\nsilly but I must have straight answers to them. Will you go along with\r\nme?"\r\n\r\nI nodded my head.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s see now. If you were the head of a government and wanted to\r\nascertain whether another country was ready for admission into the\r\nUnited Nations, what would you do?"\r\n\r\nI shrugged. "I suppose I would read books and magazines from the country\r\nand possibly have an interview with the heads of the government. After I\r\nhad collected my data I could then act upon it."\r\n\r\n"For the sake of argument suppose the books and other periodicals were\r\nwritten so as to be prejudicial in favor of the government, and the\r\nheads also were coloring what they said."\r\n\r\nI thought for a minute. "In that case I suppose I would secretly place\r\nsomeone inside the country to interview the people and get a first hand\r\nview of the situation. Then I would act on his data."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe nodded his head. "Yes, the people themselves and the conditions they\r\nlive in will give you the needed data." He turned a page in the book.\r\n"Now suppose that you wished to know if a certain planet was ready to\r\nenter into an organization such as the Galactic Federation, what would\r\nyou do?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose I\'d act as I did before. Place people inside the various\r\nareas of the planet to interview and observe. They would bring back the\r\ninformation needed to ascertain whether they would be an asset or a\r\ndetriment to the organization."\r\n\r\nI thought to myself that the question was a trifle silly; after all,\r\nhadn\'t science proved that life couldn\'t exist on the other planets in\r\nour system?\r\n\r\nHe relaxed after I answered and his smile was brighter than the previous\r\nones. "Right," he said.

"Naturally we had to learn the language first,\r\nbut now a first-hand check can be made. You see, there is a civilization\r\nout there," he raised his hand and swept the sky, "and we have to check\r\nto see if this planet is ready to take its place as an adult\r\ncivilization with the rest of us.\r\n\r\n"Earth, within a very short time, will be reaching her fingers into\r\nspace. Once she gets there she will be eligible to join the Galactic\r\nFederation."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all right," I said, "then we can exchange culture and knowledge\r\nwith other civilizations."\r\n\r\n"Yes, if you are eligible to join."\r\n\r\n"But you said that once we reach space we will be eligible."\r\n\r\n"Look at it this way," he said. "The main purpose of the Galactic\r\nFederation is to promote peace and understanding among the various\r\nplanets. Earth would have to be prepared to take its place as just\r\nanother member, and not an important member at that. Earth, you see, is\r\none of the smaller planets and also would be the latest one to join.\r\n\r\n"In times past some planets have reached space without being fully\r\nprepared for what they would find. They still had internal troubles on\r\ntheir own worlds. We had to place them in quarantine until they reached\r\nthat degree of civilization where they were ready to live in peace. Now\r\nwe check a planet before it reaches the space-travel stage. We find out\r\nthe reactions of the inhabitants to certain situations."\r\n\r\n"What sort of situations?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Well, naturally we want to see their artifacts as an indication as to\r\ntheir advancement. We have to know what the average man thinks of space\r\ntravel and trade with other planets. And their ideas on peace and their\r\nfeelings towards their fellow men. All are very important.\r\n\r\n"Actually, when a planet once enters the Federation the people are the\r\nones to decide on peace and war. So if the majority of the people on a\r\nplanet are peace-loving that planet is ready to enter the Federation."\r\n\r\n"But how do you find out all these things?" 

=== Chunk 4 ===
I asked. "When a man finds\r\nout what you are trying to prove he may lie because he wants to get into\r\nspace."\r\n\r\nHis eyes held a mischievous glint as he answered. "Simple, the art of\r\ntelepathy has been highly developed among my race. I have your thoughts\r\non everything I\'ve mentioned. Later, when all the data from thousands of\r\nsimilar interviews is in it will be evaluated and the decision made as\r\nto whether your world will be allowed to reach space. We have the means\r\nof keeping you from it if we decide you aren\'t yet ready."\r\n\r\nHe stood up and I followed suit. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
"I must be going now," he sighed. "This\r\nwork keeps me on the run and I have many more interviews to make.\r\nBelieve me, it was a pleasure meeting you. I hope we meet again--later."\r\nWe shook hands and he strolled over the hill into the valley.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I should have followed him, but it wouldn\'t have done any good,\r\nreally. Because a few moments later I saw something shimmering over the\r\ntop of the hill. It was big and disc-shaped and shot into the sky with a\r\nspeed that was unbelievable.\r\n\r\nI still don\'t know what to think about him or what we talked about. I\'m\r\ngoing to keep watching the papers though, and hoping he got the right\r\nanswers. If we reach the Moon I\'ll know he did....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Imagination_ May 1954.
