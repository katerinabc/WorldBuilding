But more puzzling\r\n            was the victory to be won--after he met defeat!\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Imagination Stories of Science and Fantasy\r\n                             October 1954\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the day.\r\n\r\nThe automobile with its three passengers moved slowly along the quiet\r\nmorning street. There was no need for hurry.\r\n\r\nThe boy\'s father was soberly recalling his own war experiences,\r\nwondering how similar Tom\'s would be. The mother was remembering\r\nvividly fragments of films, of facsimile reports, of forgotten\r\nconversations, envisioning her son cringing pathetically in a shallow\r\nfoxhole as the penultimate weapon burst into grisly glory in the dark\r\ndawn sky. Tom\'s own thoughts were tense, but he managed to conceal his\r\nnervousness from his parents.\r\n\r\n"We\'re here, son," his father announced calmly, pulling the car up to\r\nthe curb.\r\n\r\n"Dear, can\'t we drive around the block just once?" his mother asked,\r\nher voice almost a whisper.\r\n\r\n"We\'re early."\r\n\r\n"No, mom," Tom said crisply. He opened the door and stepped out onto\r\nthe sidewalk.\r\n\r\n"Want us to go in, son?"\r\n\r\n"No thanks, Dad."\r\n\r\n"But we want to, Tom," his mother said. "Of course, we\'ll go in!"\r\n\r\n"There\'s no need for you to. I\'m already registered," he told her. He\r\nreached out to grip his father\'s hand.\r\n\r\n"Tom!" his mother protested.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t worry about me." He kissed her hurriedly, and was relieved when\r\nhis father drove away without waiting for him to start up the steps.\r\nHe knew that they would worry, and he turned abruptly, forcing his\r\nattention away.\r\n\r\nThe day was bright and a chill breeze swept in from the Pacific. Atop\r\na distant hill eucalyptus glimmered in the white sunlight. Inscribed\r\nover the portal of the modest building which he now faced were the\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n                          DEPARTMENT OF PEACE\r\n                           "THAT THE AGE OF\r\n                         VIOLENCE MAY FOREVER\r\n                            REMAIN HISTORY"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBullets splattered into the mound in front of the foxhole, sending a\r\ndense spray of dust and gravel into the pit. Tom spit out the mouthful\r\nof dirt and cursed.\r\n\r\n"They comin\'?" the soldier next to him asked, waking slightly.\r\n\r\n"No." Tom told him gloomily. "But they know where we are."\r\n\r\n"Maybe they\'ll try mortar. Think they\'ll try mortar?"\r\n\r\nTom shrugged.

"Go on back to sleep. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
I\'m watching."\r\n\r\nThe other was several years older than he, and a corporal, but not very\r\nbright. Still, it was better than being alone. The worst thing he could\r\nimagine was having to face the enemy utterly alone. If only he could\r\nremember what the enemy looked like, it would not be so bad.\r\n\r\nHe forgot so much. Sometimes it seemed like he had been in combat just\r\na few days. But other times it felt like he had been up there forever,\r\nwaiting, moving forward, moving backward, thinking that at last he\r\nwas beginning to get the picture, but not sure, never sure, never sure\r\nof _anything_. If only he could recall something beside the immediate\r\npresent. Then maybe the situation would start to make a little sense.\r\n\r\nHe knew why he was fighting, vaguely. It was to safeguard certain\r\ninalienable rights, which ones he could not exactly remember. The odd\r\nthing was that the enemy was fighting for the same goal--he sensed that\r\nintuitively. But who _was_ the enemy? He thought he had known once, but\r\nthat had been quite a while ago. What did they look like? He would have\r\nto ask someone.\r\n\r\nAn infrared flare blossomed some distance down the valley. Tom adjusted\r\nhis binoculars and scanned the slope. Nothing. Remotely the monotonous\r\nrumble of atomic artillery began pounding through the night. From far\r\naway echoed the transient whisper of a jet.\r\n\r\nNow his legs were beginning to get cramped. That happened every night,\r\nand he knew that no matter which way he bent them the pain would\r\ncontinue to grow. However, there was always the consolation that toward\r\nmorning they would become numb.\r\n\r\nHe opened his one remaining ration can, tore back the layers of\r\nthermofoil insulation, and started devouring the warm lamb stew. The\r\ndull staccato of automatic fire commenced far down the valley. Somebody\r\nscreamed.\r\n\r\nTom contemplated his own flashless weapon, trying to recall what he\r\nhad been taught about its principle of expulsion. That had been so far\r\nback. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
A year? 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Two? He did not remember.\r\n\r\nIt was time for the corporal to take over the watch, but Tom decided\r\nto give him another ten minutes. Wearily, he raised the binoculars to\r\nhis eyes, pushed the switch. The battery was about exhausted and he\r\nreplaced it. Overhead a flare was drifting downward, and he watched as\r\nit illuminated the murky battle ground.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Light up!" the platoon sergeant growled.\r\n\r\nThe troops had been waiting for a quarter of an hour beside the\r\nroad. Tom had long since learned the futility of speculation. But\r\nconversation was vital and there had to be a topic.\r\n\r\n"Maybe they\'re trying to get trucks for us," he muttered to the soldier\r\nnext to him.\r\n\r\n"Maybe they\'re plannin\' a picnic for us," the other suggested.\r\n\r\n"Trucks. Picnics. You guys make everything too complicated," a third\r\nsoldier remarked. "Every time something happens you figure out a\r\ndifferent reason for it. Not me. The way I see it, there\'s just one\r\ncause for everything they tell us to do or don\'t do, say or don\'t say,\r\nthink or don\'t think. And that\'s _discipline_. Look at it that way and\r\nyou\'re always one ahead of \'em."\r\n\r\n"I like the idea of a picnic," the other replied obstinately. "Only\r\nit\'s supposed to be a surprise, and _that\'s_ why they don\'t tell us\r\nnothin."\r\n\r\n"Okay, you guys. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Strip those butts!"\r\n\r\nTom hoisted the straps of his pack onto his aching shoulders and fell\r\ninto file behind the other two. The heel of his left boot was wearing\r\nbadly and he could sense the strain on his ankle. He tried placing his\r\nweight on the ball of his foot, but that made him limp. Then he had no\r\ntime for concern with small discomforts, for the column was scattering\r\nat the distant whoosh of jets.\r\n\r\nTom, however, got no farther than the ditch.\r\n\r\nThe soldier who liked picnics had stumbled onto a discarded recoilless\r\nrifle shell ten feet from the road. It exploded at the contact. Tom\r\ndid not hear the jets roar past, for the pain that had burst in his\r\nleg was deafening. Momentarily he experienced a curious detached\r\nawareness of both the agony of the wound and the contortions into which\r\nhe was throwing his body. Then he collapsed on the weed-matted gravel,\r\nunconscious.\r\n\r\nHe woke to find two medical aid men seated beside him. The pain had\r\nlessened and the wound was all but covered. He watched furtively as a\r\ncorporal completed the job of daubing the gummy white substance from a\r\nfreshly opened can of plastoderm into a raw gash below his right knee.\r\nHe hoped none of the ligaments had been torn, since they would take a\r\nlot longer to evolve from the undifferentiated surrogate than would\r\nthe rest of the tissues. Tentatively he flexed his foot muscles; they\r\nseemed all right.\r\n\r\n"Just lean back, buddy. You\'re okay, now," he was informed.\r\n\r\n"How about the jets? We hit any of them?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Couldn\'t tell, but I don\'t think so. They got what they were after,\r\nthough."\r\n\r\n"Yeah? What was that?"\r\n\r\n"Convoy of trucks comin\' to pick us up. That\'s what I hear, anyway.

=== Chunk 7 ===
"\r\n\r\nTom was silent for a while. Then he asked: "I\'m not going to have any\r\ntrouble with that, am I?"\r\n\r\n"No, but take it easy for the next couple of days. I\'ll put a bandage\r\non it, but it takes time for that stuff to gel."\r\n\r\nHe went to work on the bandage, while his companion started packing up\r\nthe apparatus. Five minutes later they had gone.\r\n\r\nTom lay thinking. None of his questions had yet been answered. He still\r\ncould not think coherently about even the recent past. And nobody\r\nhad been able to state clearly just whom they were fighting, though\r\neveryone agreed on the motives for the war: they were defending freedom\r\nagainst tyranny--it was as simple and as basic as that. However, it\r\nsomehow left Tom unsatisfied.\r\n\r\n"Well, what did I tell you?" the soldier next to him remarked.\r\n"Discipline. No trucks. No picnic. Just discipline. Say, how about a\r\ncigarette. I must have dropped mine in the scramble."\r\n\r\n"Sure." Tom threw him a mashed, half-empty pack.\r\n\r\n"Hey, thanks." He lit one, carefully buttoning the rest in a pocket of\r\nhis fatigue jacket. "Thanks a lot.

=== Chunk 8 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Okay, you guys," came the hoarse command. "Strip them butts! We\'re\r\nmovin\'."\r\n\r\n"Discipline," the soldier muttered bitterly, crushing the cigarette\r\ninto the gravel. "Discipline."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe night was quiet, too quiet. There were remote and occasional\r\natomic artillery bursts. But no other noise.\r\n\r\nThe two other members of the patrol were immediately ahead of Tom.\r\nBut they progressed slowly and made little sound. Tom crept forward a\r\nsingle notch, looking up only when he had sunk again into the grass.\r\nOn either side there was nothing but blackness. Once more he squirmed\r\nforward with his boots and forearms. Still there was only the quiet and\r\ndarkness of night. He lay there for a while, waiting and wondering.\r\n\r\nHe had ceased pondering those questions which had most concerned him\r\nduring the earlier days. Now he asked himself only when would it be\r\nover. Nothing else any longer seemed to matter. But more and more\r\nfrequently there had come to his mind a single irrelevant memory. It\r\nwas an image of a clear day, of a cool breeze off the ocean, of a crest\r\nof green and gold eucalyptus on a faraway hill. It had something to\r\ndo with home. But that was all he knew of it, and it was all he could\r\nrecall of home.\r\n\r\nA burst of flashless automatic fire from somewhere up the ridge brought\r\na scream from the soldier in front of him and sent him writhing down\r\nthe slope. Tom lowered himself till he was on a level with the sight\r\nof his carbine, then started scanning the rise. A moment later he\r\nspotted the greenish glow of the sniper\'s infrared beam, and flipping\r\nthe safety onto automatic, he squeezed the trigger. Rapidly he replaced\r\nthe clip and waited. After several moments, he uncautiously flooded the\r\nterrain with his own light. A mere hundred feet away was a sprawling\r\ngreenish form. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
One of the enemy. A good and dead one.\r\n\r\nIt was ten minutes before he heard the remaining member of the patrol\r\nworking his way back.\r\n\r\n"Good boy!" came a whisper. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
"You got him."\r\n\r\n"What about--"\r\n\r\n"What do _you_ think?"\r\n\r\n"Are we going back?"\r\n\r\n"Sure. There ain\'t no troops up there. That\'s what we came to find out.\r\nMaybe a few snipers is all."\r\n\r\nThey started crawling the way they had come. But this time it was more\r\ntedious because of the abrasions and bruises that had been incurred.\r\nDawn was a pastey gray in the sky behind them when they at last neared\r\nthe lines.\r\n\r\n"Something funny," the sergeant muttered suspiciously, rising to his\r\nknees.\r\n\r\n"What\'s wrong," Tom asked wearily.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. Wait here." Tom waited till the sky threatened to become\r\nlight, then began following. He continued along the route which he felt\r\nmust lead to the lines, but after some minutes began to feel a sense\r\nof panic. The landmarks were all wrong and the cloud-strewn sky gave\r\nno indication of direction. Then, from the other side of a low, rocky\r\nhillock came the unmistakable sound of approaching troops. Running\r\nforward to the edge, he stopped abruptly as he found himself face to\r\nface with the enemy.\r\n\r\nSuddenly all the hate and guilt he had ever known exploded into his\r\nawareness. The face before him was a meaningless blur, but he did not\r\nneed to know the enemy to loathe him. His carbine was in his hands, the\r\nsafety off, the barrel lowered, the trigger squeezed--but the rifle\r\nfailed to fire.\r\n\r\nThe cry of the enemy was a wordless oath of anger, the bayonet a\r\nglinting sliver of death, the pain in his side the ultimate peak of\r\nagony. But as he fell back onto the rocks, he sensed something beyond\r\nrage in the bright young eyes of his destroyer. He sensed hope--the\r\npossibility of peace and even of happiness--for those anger-maddened\r\neyes had been his own.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe woke upon a bed in a small white-walled room. It was too soon yet to\r\ntry to think things over. So he consciously relaxed and contemplated\r\nsuch immediate and basic pleasures as breathing and observing the\r\ndistant sun-gilt eucalyptus through the single broad window. For the\r\npresent, the experience of life itself was sufficient.\r\n\r\nWhen at last an attendant entered, followed by a nurse, Tom felt like\r\ntalking. He was frustrated in this by a thermometer, which the woman\r\nallowed to remain in his mouth throughout the entire check-up. When she\r\nhad finally concluded her routine, Tom said: "I\'m feeling pretty good,\r\ndoctor. Is it all right if I leave?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m just a mere psychotechnician," the man smiled. "You\'ll have to\r\ncheck with Miss Laughton."\r\n\r\n"Fit as a fiddle," the nurse responded, gathering up her equipment.\r\n\r\n"My bayonet wound okay?" Tom asked anxiously, and was immediately\r\nstartled to find he could refer to the incident with amusement.\r\n\r\n"It is if you can talk about it," she replied with a flicker of\r\nsympathy on her dry expressionless face.\r\n\r\n"So it was a bayonet," the man commented after the nurse had left.\r\n"That\'s quite rare, you know. Usually it\'s a bullet or a shell\r\nfragment.

=== Chunk 11 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you decide--I mean, don\'t you set it all up beforehand?

=== Chunk 12 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no. Electrohypnosis merely instigates certain motivational and\r\nsituational patterns. The instrumentation and environment is entirely\r\nthe product of your own personality. The more feasible, consistent\r\nand coherent the subjective aspects, the more adaptable, rational and\r\nstable must be the subject."\r\n\r\n"What about the bayonet?"\r\n\r\n"You chose that, I would suppose, because you not only weren\'t afraid\r\nof meeting the enemy, but actually wanted to. We\'ll go into that later.\r\nNow I want you to relate everything you can remember."\r\n\r\nTom waited while the other set up a recorder. It took less than twenty\r\nminutes to narrate every detail he could recall.\r\n\r\n"Well that\'ll be enough for today. We do want you to report back in a\r\nweek or so, just to find out how this affects your normal activities.\r\nThe receptionist will make an appointment for you. Your clothes are in\r\nthe closet."\r\n\r\nTom dressed and started along the corridor, stopping only once for a\r\nbrief glimpse of the machine which had been his battleground. A boy he\r\nhad seen occasionally at school was approaching, and they nodded at one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n"You been through it?" the boy asked.\r\n\r\n"Yeh," Tom told him, a little uneasily.\r\n\r\n"I\'m just going in. How is it?" Tom noticed the other boy\'s collar was\r\ndamp with perspiration and his eyes were somewhat watery. "Is it pretty\r\nrough?"\r\n\r\n"Well, it\'s--" Tom returned uncomfortably. "It\'s just like war."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe turned away as the other winced and swallowed nervously. The\r\nreceptionist made his appointment and he strode to the doorway.\r\nAlready the horrors of a mere hour before seemed years in the past,\r\nand he wondered, as he proceeded down the steps into the same bright\r\nday he had left so long ago, how those vague and distant imaginings\r\ncould possibly affect his future behavior. He readily admitted that he\r\nwould be far less inclined to defend the concept of war than he would\r\nhave been earlier. But surely it was possible that, under certain\r\nconditions, he might find himself in a situation where he had no\r\nalternative to violence. Those who had been through it never seemed to\r\nget into fights like other kids did, but that could be simply a matter\r\nof growing up.\r\n\r\nThen why, he wondered, was electrohypnosis universally required and the\r\nkeystone of the armistice which had concluded the Third World War? With\r\nthe exception of a few thoroughly socialized individuals whose capacity\r\nfor occasional force was necessary to the maintenance of law and\r\norder, every male human being of fifteen underwent the experience. So\r\nthere must be some aspect of its consequences which he had overlooked.\r\n\r\nFor some reason a memory of three small boys playing soldier on\r\nan autumn dusk slipped in among his thoughts. How disenchantingly\r\ndifferent had been the unreal realism of the dream. With an amused\r\nstart it occurred to him that the same genuine Captain America Infrared\r\nElectronic Sniperkit that had seen him through those childhood\r\nskirmishes had accompanied him into combat that morning. And for an\r\ninstant he wondered if such a thing as an infrared flare actually did\r\nexist.\r\n\r\nStepping onto the sidewalk, he turned toward home. He would be there\r\nin just a little over three hours after his parents had left him.\r\nThey could not have worried too much in so short a period. Still, he\r\ndecided, it would be best to call them. Everyone had heard rumors of\r\nsubjects coming out of electrohypnosis with psychosomatic or neurotic\r\nafter effects. And, while these had been authoritatively discounted, it\r\nwould be typical of his mother to imagine her son the exception.\r\n\r\nThere was a drugstore on the next corner and Tom headed toward it.\r\nHe did not notice the two younger school acquaintances until they had\r\ncrossed the street and halted in his path. He had never been on cordial\r\nterms with either of them, and was in no mood for their banter today.\r\n\r\n"Well, look who\'s back from the wars!" the more aggressive of the pair\r\nexclaimed. "Where\'s your medals, Colonel?"\r\n\r\n"Yeah!" the other gibed. 

=== Chunk 13 ===
"And what happened to your crutches?"\r\n\r\nTom regretted very much not having left the building by a rear exit.\r\nTheir reaction to meeting him in that manner, considering their\r\ndetermination not to exhibit any anxiety over their own imminent\r\nordeals, was bound to be antagonistic. However, his own responses had\r\nnot yet stabilized adequately following the experience to permit much\r\ntolerance. He ignored them and started on.\r\n\r\n"Come on, Tom," the first persisted, stepping swiftly into his path.\r\n"Tell us about it. How many of \'em did you get?"\r\n\r\n"Bet he didn\'t get any. Bet he just buried himself in his foxhole till\r\nit was all over. Bet he was scared stiff."\r\n\r\n"Naw, not the Colonel. He was out there in front all the time. Weren\'t\r\nyou, Colonel?"\r\n\r\nIrritation flamed into anger. Raising his hand, he was about to push\r\nthem aside when the hot searing pain of the bayonet struck him, hurling\r\nhim back against the wall. For an uncomprehending moment he leaned\r\nimmobile, his mouth gaping, his eyes awed. Then, realizing the only\r\nway out, he relaxed. The agony subsided and vanished. So _that_ was\r\nit, he thought bitterly. So _that_ was the ultimate weapon--not the\r\nindoctrination. For the rest of his life he was to be burdened with the\r\npossibility of that vivid torture whenever he so much as considered\r\nusing force.\r\n\r\nThe boys had backed away apprehensively, and now were moving on down\r\nthe street with frequent backward glances. It made no difference to\r\nhim. For the present, they were of another age, an age of violence, an\r\nage which he had outgrown.\r\n\r\nThe drugstore was crowded, but Tom made his way toward the rear\r\nwithout noticing the customers. His thoughts were soberly and intently\r\nfocused on the future. Perhaps, he considered, by the time his great\r\ngrandchildren were men a way of life would have been created which\r\ninvolved neither the inevitability of war nor the alternate necessity\r\nfor an invisible, poised bayonet. And so far as his own life was\r\nconcerned, if the latter meant that he could return home, instead of\r\ntrudging back to the barracks, then he accepted it gracefully. The\r\nprice of peace was bound to be high, he reflected, since man had never\r\nbefore been able to afford it.\r\n\r\nSliding into the phonebooth and pushing a coin into the slot, Tom began\r\ndialing.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
