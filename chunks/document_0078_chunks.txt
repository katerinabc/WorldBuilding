]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe three crew members of the Ad Astra looked at one another, grinning\r\nweakly, in the whispering silence after the motors had kicked off. This\r\nwas the culminating point of a half-century of preparation; behind them\r\nwas the satellite launching station--ahead of them, a faint red dot,\r\nwas Mars.\r\n\r\nBryan, nominal head of the expedition, touched the shutter studs that\r\nopened their windows on the universe. They stood silently, the three of\r\nthem; Bryan and Hughes looking back at the majesty of the retreating\r\nEarth--Williams, rigid with ecstasy at the forward port.\r\n\r\nThe stars were his passion and his joy. Women filled a momentary\r\nneed, men he accepted or rejected as they could help him to achieve\r\nhis goal. Now, as astrogator of the Ad Astra he had fulfilled his\r\ndream; and now before him Canopus, Rigel, Cassiopeia and Aldebaran lay\r\njewel-like on the dark velvet of space.\r\n\r\nHow stars had absorbed the thoughts of mankind since the beginning, he\r\nthought happily, and what dreams had the ancient Chaldeans known as\r\nthey mapped the routes of the galleons of space? And the poets.... "See\r\nhow the floor of Heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold--"\r\nhe quoted softly.\r\n\r\n"My, that\'s pretty," Bryan said solemnly behind him.

"Who said that?

"\r\n\r\n"Williams did--" returned Hughes equally dead-pan.\r\n\r\nWilliams flushed under their good-natured grins. "Shakespeare said it,\r\nyou uneducated yokels," he said loftily. "How come you aren\'t cheating\r\neach other at gin rummy yet? Last I heard one of you owed the other a\r\nmillion dollars."\r\n\r\n"It was only six hundred thousand," Hughes grinned, "and I\'m about to\r\ntake him double or nothing!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe weeks passed slowly. Barely audible, the computers ticked, keeping\r\nthe ship on course. Bryan and Hughes wrangled amiably over their\r\ninterminable card-games, throwing an occasional, joking aside to\r\nWilliams watching the stars, absorbed as a miser fingering his jewels.\r\n\r\nMars, from a minute speck, grew to a planet lying bloody in the\r\ncold rays of the distant sun. Strapped down in obedience to the\r\ncomputer-given signal, the ship reversed, fired its rockets and touched\r\ndown on her supporting pillars of flame and became only a shining\r\nneedle dwarfed in the immensity of the pinkish-red desert.\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other doubtfully, conscious of anti-climax. This\r\nwas little different from the far reaches of the Gobi plateau where\r\nthey had trained for weary, boring months. Bryan and Hughes drew the\r\nlots as the two to don their heated, protective suits and explore\r\nwithin cautious distance of the ship. Williams, restless and bored,\r\nwatched their horseplay resentfully. Even the tenuous atmosphere of the\r\ndead world dimmed the splendor of the heavens; why didn\'t they hurry\r\nand get it over with? He shivered a little watching Bryan and Hughes\r\ntrudging clumsily in the sand, throwing out a comment occasionally for\r\nthe benefit of the tape recorder in the cabin.\r\n\r\n"This is different from the deserts back home," Hughes said. "Back\r\nthere you get the feeling they\'re just waiting for somebody to move in,\r\nbut here...."\r\n\r\n"It\'s more like a haunted house," Bryan finished for him. Williams,\r\nadjusting his headphones, was conscious of a deepening of his faint\r\nuneasiness--why didn\'t they hurry up and get back! All they really had\r\nto do was build a cairn and plant the Federation flag. They had found a\r\nfew rocks and Bryan was stooping to bury the prepared canister with the\r\ndata of the flight--\r\n\r\nWilliams watching incredulously as Bryan and Hughes reeled and\r\nstaggered, was dimly conscious of a sudden faint tremor along the ship.\r\nThere was an abrupt metallic shrieking in his headset, a background of\r\nthundering, grinding bedlam, and over it Bryan\'s voice frantic--\r\n\r\n"Cave-in! Lift ship--_lift ship_!"\r\n\r\nIt had been the one constant in the shifting, nebulous mass of theory\r\ndrilled into them. _They_ were valuable--the _ship_ was irreplaceable.\r\nWith a last unbelieving look of horror at the gigantic crack widening\r\nunder the very feet of his companions, Williams threw himself into\r\nthe control seat and threw the lever over to "takeoff" position. The\r\nrockets fired and the ship rose majestically, the thousand foot fiery\r\nsplendor of her trail blotting out the space-suited figures toppling\r\ninto the thundering chasm.\r\n\r\nHours later, Williams pulled himself up, looking around dazedly. The\r\nmotors had shut off and the great ship was coasting noiselessly along\r\nthe return track; only the computers ticked steadily and the air-valves\r\nmade a muted shushing in the silence. Funny he hadn\'t noticed the\r\nsilence on the way out--sometimes he had even been irritated with the\r\nnoise Bryan and Hughes had made with their eternal wrangling over their\r\ncards. Automatically he pushed the forward viewing plate button feeling\r\nthe familiar sense of timeless peace as he looked out on the eternal\r\nsuns.\r\n\r\nMechanically he ate and slept in the days that followed, dimly aware\r\nof a giggling, wild-eyed stranger in some remote corner of his mind,\r\nwaiting to overtake him if he showed awareness of his presence. He\r\npushed away too, the thought of Bryan and Hughes, forgetting in the\r\nsameness of his days that he had ever been anything but alone. At first\r\nhe had cried a little in his lonesomeness, but as the weeks went on\r\nhe remembered only that once there had been others who had deserted\r\nhim. He nodded familiarly to the stars, smiling a little; there was\r\nonly himself and them, shining steadfastly above him. They would never\r\nchange--never desert him!\r\n\r\nTime went by unnoticed. The green dot of Earth became a glowing green\r\nand blue orb, circled by a tiny white dot. The computer changed its\r\nrhythm--above the control board the "strap-in" warning flashed unseen\r\nas the rockets fired swinging the ship into the turnover, ready for\r\norbit with the satellite ferry station. Williams gazing with dreamy\r\npleasure at the jewelled curtain above him was hurled against the port\r\nby the sudden surge of acceleration. The ship heeled over, twisted,\r\nthen turned----\r\n\r\nWilliams hung head down, screaming, as the black curtain tore, the\r\nstars falling dizzily away--_below_ him....\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _He screamed once, falling face down through the stars,\r\nthrough the gold-inlaid, dizzying, beautiful, sickening...._]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA year later, the psychiatrists, quite pleased with themselves found\r\nhim ready for duty again; not in Space of course, but the hero of the\r\nfirst Mars expedition was always sure of a job with Space Authority.\r\nNow he could even look up at the stars at night without screaming with\r\nvertigo.\r\n\r\nTonight walking confidently along the country road, fragrant and\r\ndotted with shining pools after the recent rain, he looked up thinking\r\nnostalgically, "the patines of bright gold...."\r\n\r\nA coldness about his feet halted him. He looked down and once again the\r\nblack curtain tore before his eyes--once more they were there, the cold\r\nunfriendly stars, swinging in the empty void--\r\n\r\nBelow him.\r\n\r\nFalling downward past the whirling suns, he screamed, hardly aware of\r\nthe choking wetness in his lungs....\r\n\r\nAbout him the inch-deep shining pool rippled for a moment and was\r\nstill, reflecting once more the floor of Heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
