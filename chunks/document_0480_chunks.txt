"\r\n\r\n    "Thanks, that sounds great!" said Mac. But, "Wait!"\r\n      Begged the other, "Gimme a break!\r\n    Help me out of this rut, MacNeer, and cut\r\n      Me in on a share of the take?"\r\n    "The take?" asked Doug with a little shrug,\r\n      "But _I_ haven\'t made any find!"\r\n    And he strolled away with a whistle gay\r\n      While the monkey glowered behind.\r\n\r\n    In a moment or two, Doug wandered through\r\n      The gaudily-neoned door\r\n    Of a feverish-gay, bright cabaret;\r\n      Below, on the mirrored floor\r\n    Of the dancehall swayed a cavalcade\r\n      Of every breed and race\r\n    Whose daughters and sons defy the suns\r\n      To journey the ways of space.\r\n\r\n    A miner from Mars, pockmarked with scars\r\n      Pressed close to a woman from Io,\r\n    A Jovian baby drawled lazily, "Maybe--"\r\n      To pleas of a tar from Ohio;\r\n    A vicious-mouthed slattern from faraway Saturn\r\n      Sang ditties to make the hair curl.\r\n    And then--curtains parted, and Doug MacNeer started\r\n      To see such a beautiful girl!\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Krull, a mining town in N.

he managed to answer.\r\n    Then, in sudden alarm, "Are you one of the charm-\r\n      Gals?" he questioned, "Or only a dancer?"\r\n    Now, why an admission of her true position\r\n      Nell should at that moment decide\r\n    To conceal is a mystery buried in history;\r\n      Whatever the reason, she lied.\r\n\r\n    In fashion designed to make any man blind\r\n      She lowered her lashes and blushed.\r\n    (Which was no mean achievement itself.) "Oh, believe\r\n      Me! I\'m no--entertainer," she gushed.\r\n    "I sell cigarettes, and I sometimes take bets\r\n      On the rocketship races--" MacNeer\r\n    Slowly nodded his head as he quietly said\r\n      "A girl like you shouldn\'t be here!\r\n\r\n    "I think we\'d do well to get out of this hell\r\n      Of evil and vice," he decided.\r\n    Nell had to sit still and bite her lips till\r\n      Her inner amusement subsided.\r\n    This curious sucker, it suddenly struck her,\r\n      Meant business! His motives were pure.\r\n    To lead on the calf should be good for a laugh ...\r\n      She smiled at him, shy and demure.\r\n\r\n    "Oh, I cannot do that," she replied, "but a chat\r\n      In a quieter spot--?" And she led\r\n    Dougal out of the blare to a cool garden square\r\n      With the stars burning high overhead.\r\n    She gave orders by sign that a beaker of wine\r\n      Be served in their shady retreat,\r\n    And wondered how long it would be ere this strong,\r\n      Handsome stranger acknowledged defeat.\r\n\r\n    But strangest to tell, it was Doug and not Nell\r\n      Who emerged from that contest the victor.\r\n    It was nothing he did, but a loneliness hid\r\n      In her bosom that finally tricked her.\r\n    For Doug spoke of the night, and the glorious flight\r\n      Of ships through the reaches of Space;\r\n    Of his hopes and his schemes--and his words wakened dreams\r\n      That softened the lines of Nell\'s face.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\n    He was just on the verge of confessing the urge\r\n      That brought him back out of the void\r\n    When a servant discreet appeared in their retreat\r\n      And Nell faced the fellow, annoyed.\r\n    "Well?" she icily said. The man bobbed his head.\r\n      "A visiphone call on the rack."\r\n    Nell sighed as she rose. "Some friend, I suppose.\r\n      Wait, Dougal; I\'ll hurry right back."\r\n\r\n    An expression surprisingly soft in her eyes,\r\n      She answered the visiphone.\r\n    Her caller, however (the cradle-monk), never\r\n      Detected her altered tone.\r\n    "Hey, Nell, there\'s a chump on his way to your dump,\r\n      A big, quiet sort of a lout\r\n    By name of MacNeer--" Nell told him, "He\'s here;\r\n      What\'s all the commotion about?"\r\n\r\n    A hungry grimace of greed mottled the face of\r\n      The vengeful space-harbor assistant.\r\n    "Do I get my percent for a tip on the gent?"\r\n      He parried in accents insistent.\r\n    "You mean--?" whispered Nell.

And, "Surer than hell!"\r\n      The answer came back, swift and eager,\r\n    "I\'ve just seen his log, and he\'s in from the Bog\r\n      With a claim-stake the size of Omega!"\r\n\r\n    Now, for those who don\'t know their A. L. & O.[3]\r\n      The "Bog" is a treacherous sector\r\n    Of planetoids legion, a tightly-packed region\r\n      Avoided by every prospector.\r\n    None but the most daring do any space-faring\r\n      In those lethal, whirlagig niches,\r\n    But spacemen all claim that the Bog is aflame\r\n      With infinite, fabulous riches.\r\n\r\n    \'Twas thence that the crew of the L-32\r\n      Returned with a cargo of ore\r\n    That assayed ninety-one and a half to the ton\r\n      --Or maybe a little bit more.\r\n    It was out of the Bog that old space-weasel Scrogg\r\n      Withdrew on his gravity-tractor\r\n    The rock 4-Omega, which brought such a figure\r\n      Scrogg set himself up as a Factor.\r\n\r\n    So it\'s easily seen why Nell\'s new, serene\r\n      Complaisance should disappear rudely.\r\n    She gasped and she started; her crimson lips parted;\r\n      Her eyes narrowed sharply and shrewdly.\r\n    "You\'re positive?" Slyly responded the spy,\r\n      "Why else would he put into Krull\r\n    With motors O.Q., and flame-jets brand-new,\r\n      And fuel-chambers more than half-full?"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: A. L.

"You have?" she replied,\r\n      And suddenly somewhere within her\r\n    A duel transpired \'tween the Nell who admired\r\n      This miner and Nelly the sinner.\r\n    Which would have won out is a matter of doubt\r\n      But Dougal MacNeer, growing bolder,\r\n    At that moment tossed dice with Fate--and he lost!\r\n      --By placing a hand on her shoulder.\r\n\r\n    He bent to her ear, and, "Nelly, my dear,"\r\n      He whispered, "Come lift gravs with me\r\n    To the skyways above ... I\'ll teach you to love ...\r\n      How wonderfully happy we\'ll be...."\r\n    And--that was a story to Nell old and hoary;\r\n      Nell shrugged with a gesture resigned;\r\n    A lustful and bestial man, just like the rest\r\n      Of his sex....\r\n                      And she made up her mind.\r\n\r\n    Averting her face, she escaped his embrace\r\n      And whispered, "Wait here for a minute--"\r\n    A prearranged sign brought a fresh jug of wine\r\n      To Doug--with a sleeping drug in it.\r\n    Dougal, gleaming of eye, the glass lifted high\r\n      And drank it down, swiftly and deep;\r\n    In no time at all, he lay there asprawl\r\n      In impotent, stertorous sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n\r\n    A pungent aroma jarred Doug from his coma\r\n      Much later. He lifted his head\r\n    To find he was not in the cool, shady grot\r\n      But in some sort of workshop, instead.\r\n    His senses were blurry, his tongue thick and furry;\r\n      He gagged at the odor and choked.\r\n    Then, head still awhirl, he noticed the girl,\r\n      And, "Nelly, where are we?" he croaked.\r\n\r\n    But the girl standing there with the bright yaller hair\r\n      Was hardly the girl of his dreams.\r\n    She was distant and cold, her manner was bold,\r\n      Her eyes glistened brightly with schemes.\r\n    With icy _\xc3\xa9lan_ she spoke to the man\r\n      At Dougal\'s side, "Very well, Gurk,\r\n    He\'s come to his senses, let\'s drop the pretenses;\r\n      Its time we got down to our work."\r\n\r\n    "Work, Nell?" Dougal gasped, and confusedly clasped\r\n      His hammering head in his hands.\r\n    He learned, then, that he was bound, foot and knee,\r\n      To his seat by unbreakable bands.\r\n    Nell said with a numb, deadly smile, "Don\'t play dumb!\r\n      Be smart and you\'ll shorten this visit.\r\n    We know from your log you struck gold in the Bog;\r\n      Now, come clean and tell us--where is it?"\r\n\r\n    "G-gold?" gulped MacNeer. "Th-there\'s some mistake here!"\r\n      He grinned, "Aw, you\'re kidding me, honey!\r\n    Now, be a good sport--" The girl cut him short,\r\n      "I don\'t think this matter is funny!\r\n    I gave you a chance to go into your dance;\r\n      If you won\'t, why--" She shifted her eyes\r\n    To her white-coated aide. "Well, Gurk, I\'m afraid\r\n      He must talk through the _menavise_."\r\n\r\n    As Doug MacNeer\'s eyes opened wide in surprise\r\n      Gurk drew from a nearby cask\r\n    A shimmering, fiery helmet of wire;\r\n      A sinister sort of mask.\r\n    Doug never had seen the fantastic machine\r\n      Before, but he\'d oftentimes heard\r\n    Of the dreaded and hated device that translated\r\n      Men\'s thoughts into spoken words!\r\n\r\n    With a terrible cry of anger, on high\r\n      He lifted his brawny fists,\r\n    But an instrument clicked, and manacles snicked!\r\n      Like vises about his wrists.\r\n    "Well, _now_ will you tell us?" persisted Nell.\r\n      "There\'s nothing to tell!" he said.\r\n    Nell\'s warm lips drew fine, and she made a brief sign ...\r\n      And the helmet dropped over his head!\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VI\r\n\r\n    It was Nell who depressed the stud that expressed\r\n      In flaming, electric flood\r\n    The current that boils its way through the coils\r\n      Of a menavisal hood.\r\n    There was silence at first, then the silence burst\r\n      In a moment of horror fraught,\r\n    As Doug MacNeer\'s voice babbled clear\r\n      In fragments of tortured thought.\r\n\r\n    "_I don\'t understand ... I can\'t move a hand ...\r\n      Head aches, and my brain is on fire....\r\n    Stars ... Nelly ... Oh, Lord!_" Thus Dougal\'s thoughts poured\r\n       In words through the webwork of wire.\r\n    "_Must be a mistake ... I can\'t be awake\r\n      The orbit of Ceres is reckoned\r\n    At three-oh-oh-ten...._" Nell stepped forward then.\r\n      "O.Q., Gurk--let up for a second!"\r\n\r\n    The shimmering died, and to Dougal she cried,\r\n      "MacNeer, all we want to know\r\n    Is: _Where is the gold?_ As soon as you\'ve told\r\n      We promise to let you go."\r\n    "I\'ve told you already," gasped Doug, unsteady,\r\n      "You\'re wrong if you think I\'m rich--"\r\n    Nell\'s scarlet mouth curled. "Fool! Liar!" she snarled;\r\n      She viciously closed the switch.\r\n\r\n    Once again sallow flame trembled hot through the frame\r\n      Of the _menavise_; once again\r\n    Electrical stresses probed deep the recesses\r\n      Of Dougal\'s tormented brain.\r\n    "_The torments of hell--but I never can tell ...\r\n      A man must fight to the end ...\r\n    My eyes--I\'ve gone blind ... my head ... and my mind ...\r\n      If I only ... could only ... bend...._"\r\n\r\n    It is better to not reveal just what\r\n      Things Dougal said and did\r\n    In the hour or more that followed, for\r\n      Such secrets are better hid.\r\n    He babbled of dreams, and hopes and schemes,\r\n      And names long lost in the past;\r\n    He spoke of flight through the endless night,\r\n      And of cosmic reaches vast.\r\n\r\n    But never he told of wealth or gold,\r\n      Though now he was growing weak;\r\n    Till finally the girl turned to her churl\r\n      Lips set, and as marble bleak.\r\n    "He\'s stalled long enough!" she rasped. "He\'s tough,\r\n      And he\'s held out for more than an hour;\r\n    But I\'m going to get that secret yet,\r\n      If I have to turn on full power!"\r\n\r\n    Gurk shook his head, and warningly said,\r\n      "I wouldn\'t attempt it, Nell!\r\n    \'Twould be of no use, an ounce more juice\r\n      Would blister his mind to hell.\r\n    He\'s weak as a cat; if you try that--"\r\n      He frowned--"After all that he\'s had,\r\n    Another degree of power would be\r\n      Sufficient to drive him mad!"\r\n\r\n    "That\'s up to him!" cried Nell, and grim\r\n      Of eye she approached the side\r\n    Of Doug MacNeer, and, "Listen here,\r\n      You obstinate fool!" she cried,\r\n    As she pressed the key to the last degree,\r\n      "You know very well you told\r\n    Me you\'d found all the gold that a man could want\r\n      --Now, answer: _Where is that gold?_"\r\n\r\n    The _menavise_ flamed, the battered and maimed\r\n      Hulk standing before them jerked\r\n    As the blistering pain seared Dougal\'s brain,\r\n      MacNeer\'s lips horribly worked....\r\n    And across the tomblike expanse of the room\r\n      His feeble answer carried:\r\n    "... _lonely as hell ... must ask sweet Nell ...\r\n      It\'s time I was getting married...._"\r\n\r\n    "_I think that she ... and I could be ...\r\n      So happy ... a golden prize....\r\n    But ... Oh, the pain!_" And he screamed again,\r\n      The light died out of his eyes.\r\n    And Nell stood aghast, to have seen at last\r\n      The terrible answer bare:\r\n    The gold of his dream was the glorious stream\r\n      Of her own bright yaller hair!\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VII\r\n\r\n    So, stranger, if you should happen to\r\n      Drop jets in the City of Krull\r\n    By chance you may meet on a quiet street\r\n      A man who with movements dull\r\n    Roams up and down through the little town\r\n      Like someone bewitched by a spell;\r\n    And the one at his side, his companion and guide\r\n      Is the lady once known as Nell.\r\n\r\n    For the woman who made of love a trade\r\n      And discovered true love too late\r\n    Has paid at last for the sins of her past\r\n      With Dougal MacNeer as her mate.\r\n    Her hair, that was gold, is streaked now with cold\r\n      White tendrils, but still she sighs\r\n    And she waits and she prays, through long, endless days,\r\n      For the light to return to his eyes.\r\n\r\n    For--Man in his lust for raw gold may thrust\r\n      From planet to asteroid,\r\n    But the will of the Great Astronomer still\r\n      Is the Will of the cosmic void.\r\n    _And whoever shall plot for another\'s lot,\r\n      Be he brother or foe or friend,\r\n    Who seeks his gain of a fellowman\'s pain\r\n      Must pay a price in the end._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s The Ballad of Venus Nell, by Nelson S.
