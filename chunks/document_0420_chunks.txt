]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe little salesman buzzed into my hotel room exactly at 10. He must\r\nhave been waiting in the corridor, ambushing the second-hand.\r\n\r\nI watched from my deep chair in the corner while he slid open his\r\nraincoat, lifted it neatly off his back (the casual shrug wasn\'t his\r\nstyle), and stood with it hanging from his forefinger. With a bright,\r\napologetic smile he hung it up in the alcove behind the door. I decided\r\nnot to object to his using the hook without asking; it\'d just slow\r\nthings up.\r\n\r\nThe salesman smiled again, ducked out into the corridor and back in\r\nwith a flat 24x20 brief case and a large, oddly shaped suitcase. His\r\npresentation charts and a mockup of the computer, obviously. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
More\r\napologetic faces, and he sat down.\r\n\r\nHe said, "It was _very_ good of you, Mr. Borch, to give me this chance\r\nto tell you about our new, personalized Statistomat. I know you\'re a\r\nbusy man--"\r\n\r\nI raised my drooping eyelids just enough to see him properly.\r\n\r\n"--with all your responsibilities, and I hope I\'ll be able to answer\r\nall your questions on modern estate planning. That\'s what I\'m here\r\nfor!" He smiled as if he were pausing for questions, but he didn\'t\r\npause.\r\n\r\nHe intoned, "The man of wealth has a special responsibility in our\r\nsociety. He is the trustee of invested capital, on which our economy\r\nrests. His proud charge is to direct and build his holdings wisely;\r\nand natural economic laws have justly placed the nation\'s considerable\r\nestates in the hands of men equal to the charge.\r\n\r\n"At the same time, such men owe themselves freedom from deprivation.\r\nAnd they owe themselves a financial plan adapted to their\r\nown--er--preferences and tastes in freedom from deprivation. This is\r\nwhy we speak of _personalized_ estate planning. Maybe this will be\r\nstill clearer, Mr. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Borch, if we look at an example."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere we go again, I thought, as he hauled a packet out of his brief\r\ncase, opened it out into a little stand on the table, and flipped up\r\nthe first chart.\r\n\r\n"Take the case of Robert Jones, who inherits $25,000,000 from\r\nhis father. The inheritance taxes are all taken care of by\r\ninvestment-incentive deductions, so Mr. Jones has $25,000,000 in liquid\r\nassets to invest."\r\n\r\nRight on the ball, I thought. The hypothetical 25 million was just\r\nabout twice the publicly known size of the Borch estate, therefore\r\nright in the league he could figure I\'d like to be playing in. And the\r\nhypothetical Jones on the chart, confidently facing the future, was\r\nhandsome and dignified, but not _much_ more so than I was.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Jones has a wife and one young son." They appeared beside him on\r\nthe second chart, and they looked very pleasant. The salesman knew Jed\r\nBorch was unmarried. "He has planned to his satisfaction a way of life\r\nappropriate to his standing." On the next chart the Jones family was\r\nbacked up by a half-acre bungalow, a lake, and wooded hills.\r\n\r\n"His desire is for security, to ensure this pattern of living to\r\nhimself and his wife, and to his son. His personalized Statistomat\r\nplans his finances accordingly." On succeeding charts, Jones changed\r\nonly in subtle lengthening of the firm lines in his face, his wife\r\ndidn\'t change at all, but his son sprouted to a six-footer and the\r\nbungalow grew some too. A bar graph superimposed on the picture kept\r\ntrack of the investment. By the time the boy was full-grown it had\r\nrisen to a modest $100,000,000.\r\n\r\n"On the other hand, consider Michael Thompson. Starting with the same\r\nsum of $25,000,000, he may just as legitimately view different goals.\r\nMr. Thompson is unmarried, and has not yet chosen to what station he\r\nwill aspire." Chapter Two of the charts had just as admirable-looking\r\na man (different color hair). I was curious how much Statistomat would\r\nfinagle for him, but not curious enough to sit through another dozen\r\ncharts. When the salesman said, "Naturally he\'s willing to risk--" I\r\ninterrupted:\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want any risk. Can\'t afford to." I smiled slyly.\r\n"Responsibility to society."\r\n\r\n"Of course, of course, but you might be willing, like Mr. Thompson,\r\nto--er--look beyond the more accepted channels of finance for the sake\r\nof the larger returns that can be realized by breaking new ground, as\r\nit were--participating in pioneering enterprises."\r\n\r\n"Oh, sure. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Don\'t want to miss any bets."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo far you couldn\'t see anything to complain about in his pitch,\r\nconsidering it alongside the pitch for General Computers\' Incomac. In\r\nfact it essentially _was_ a General Computers pitch, with the brand\r\nname changed. Let\'s get to the point, I thought. I pointed to the odd\r\nsuitcase. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
"Uh ... what\'s that?"\r\n\r\nHe was adaptable enough to give up the Michael Thompson story and open\r\nup the suitcase, promptly and proudly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, the computer," I said, almost encouragingly.\r\n\r\nBut he didn\'t let that stand. "No," he admitted, "this is just a\r\nlife-size facsimile of the new Statistomat. I\'m afraid the real thing\r\nis too valuable and too heavy for me to carry around, even to such an\r\nimportant interview as this."\r\n\r\n"How heavy?"\r\n\r\n"I\'d say about ten times as heavy as this one," he evaded neatly. "Now\r\non this facsimile I can illustrate the ideas we\'ve been developing.\r\nHere, you see this screen and these knobs. I\'ll turn this switch on and\r\nwe can watch this part of it just as if this was the real computer."\r\n\r\nMy surprise was genuine. His demonstration mockup was a live one. I\r\nwished my brother could see it.\r\n\r\n"On this screen we record your time-dependent utility function. For\r\nyour convenience, the input is mechanical, but from this point on all\r\nthe Statistomat\'s computing is performed digitally."\r\n\r\nI said, "Huh?"\r\n\r\n"Time-dependent utility function," he repeated brightly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I can\'t be bothered--all that technical stuff--leave it to\r\nspecialists," I muttered, making the trap nice and inviting.\r\n\r\nBut he knew he had to explain. "Naturally only the essentials need\r\n_your_ personal attention," he said smoothly. "You express in the\r\ntime-dependent utility function your financial policy--the broad,\r\noverall outlines of the course you want to steer. This must come from\r\nyou. This makes the difference between a Robert Jones and a Michael\r\nThompson. You have a possibility of doubling your investment in a year,\r\nlet\'s say. How certain do you have to be of it before you prefer it to\r\na more conservative investment? Even odds? 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Six to four? Or we might ask\r\na similar question about a ten-year period. You see the point."\r\n\r\n"Uh ... but it depends on how much I\'ve got." I kicked myself. My\r\nbrother would not approve my helping the salesman along like that.\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes! Certainly! When you have a hundred million, an extra million\r\nwon\'t seem nearly as important to you as when you have twenty-five.\r\nWe understand! Our technical expression for this is that the value of\r\nmoney to the investor is not a linear function of dollars. Logarithmic,\r\nsome say--but that depends on the investor. Whatever relationship you\r\nselect as a matter of fiscal policy. That is a part, a critical part,\r\nof the information which you give the Statistomat when you work out\r\nyour time-dependent utility function, or risk function, as we call it\r\nfor short."\r\n\r\n"No risk! 

=== Chunk 8 ===
Can\'t afford risk!"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Borch, I speak with confidence when I assure you that your estate\r\ncan be subject to as little risk when its direction is assigned to the\r\nStatistomat as in any other way." I almost called him on that, until\r\nI reflected that he had really made only one specific claim: that you\r\ncould feed just as excessively conservative a risk function into the\r\nStatistomat, if you were compulsively conservative, as you could into\r\nthe G.C. Incomac. That might be true.\r\n\r\nHe went on, "Two of the soundest business research agencies in the\r\ncountry have been invited to inspect all our operations and have okayed\r\nus, not once but repeatedly: the S.E.C. and the F.T.C.

=== Chunk 9 ===
"\r\n\r\nDarn right they\'ve checked you, I thought--by law. And don\'t think\r\nthey\'ll stop.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut it didn\'t do any good to spot a steep slant in his formulations.\r\nHe was a salesman, after all. Just so he stayed clear of demonstrable\r\nfalsehoods and "fraudulent tendencies" (as defined by the 1978 Commerce\r\nAct), he was within his rights.\r\n\r\nHe was staying clear. Some of his claims a stickler might want to check\r\nup on; but I wasn\'t going to bother any more to watch for things like\r\nthat. I thought the stickler would find in each case that he\'d been\r\nwasting his time. This little salesman seemed awfully good at skating\r\njust at the edge. He really knew his profession.\r\n\r\nI didn\'t let my bafflement show. I just looked at him dully and made\r\nnoises as if I was about to say something. I was, but I didn\'t know\r\nwhat.\r\n\r\nThere just had to be something bad about this Statistomat venture.\r\nWithout (apparently) any new gimmick, a small new company was producing\r\njust as good a product as one of General Computers\' best-managed\r\ndivisions. How could Statistomat hope to deliver a normal profit? It\r\nwasn\'t reasonable. There must be badly cut corners, if not in the\r\nproduct then in the sales program or the servicing of customers; or\r\nelse the investors _weren\'t_ hoping for a normal return. In that case\r\nthere was something funny in their motives--a long-range scheme to\r\nundermine G.C., or something. That might show up in this salesman\'s\r\npitch.\r\n\r\nSo I switched to, "How do I know what stocks this thing\'ll tell me to\r\nbuy?"\r\n\r\n"Not _tell_ you to buy," he corrected charmingly, "_buy_ you. The\r\nmachine can be connected by direct wire to the Exchange\'s computer."\r\n\r\n"Yeah-yeah, but how do I know what stocks I\'ll be getting? I want\r\nGeneral Computers preferred!"\r\n\r\nHe smiled. "Quite possibly you\'ll find yourself the owner of a\r\nconsiderable block of G.C. preferred--provided of course your\r\ntime-dependent utility function dictates a policy which--"\r\n\r\n"You mean," I said, with the very suspicious expression my brother\r\nalways objected to, "you\'d let your machine bid for G.C. stock for me?"\r\n\r\n"Naturally. The Statistomat has often recommended purchase of G.C.\r\nstock. Let me explain to you an aspect of modern firm management which\r\nmay be so specialized as to have escaped your attention.\r\n\r\n"Each firm draws up what is called a preference function. It is\r\nsomewhat analogous to the investor\'s time-dependent utility function.\r\nIt gives exact expression to the objectives of the firm. For any\r\nconceivable economic position the firm might be in, it determines,\r\nlet us say, the weight the board places on a dividend this year as\r\nagainst a larger dividend a year from now, or ten. And so on. It is\r\nthe criterion for all the optimization computations which pattern the\r\nfirm\'s activities.\r\n\r\n"Under a 1978 law, every corporation offering stock on the Exchange\r\nmust publish its preference function. All these preference functions\r\nare known to your Statistomat; in effect, it is as if they were all in\r\nStatistomat\'s memory, continuously updated, automatically. Naturally,\r\nfor a particular kind of investor only certain kinds of stock are\r\nsuitable.\r\n\r\n"But Statistomat does more--and this is the point I think you\'ll find\r\nintensely interesting. After all, more than the firm\'s policy is\r\nimportant. Two firms may have identical financial policies but very\r\ndifferent dividend rates, either due to different degrees of success or\r\nto different kinds of partial success. Statistomat also has available\r\nto it a sound estimate of the firm\'s expectations--"\r\n\r\n"Who does the--uh--estimating?"\r\n\r\n"Based entirely on Commerce Department reports. That\'s as impartial as\r\nyou can get, Mr. Borch, and it\'s also one of the best-informed sources\r\nin the country. This information is processed at our home office on one\r\nof the largest automatic computers in the world. You see, Statistomat\r\nIncorporated is deeply conscious of its responsibility to give flawless\r\nservice to the men who control and direct America\'s fortunes."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe little salesman sounded overconfident again so I thought I\'d shake\r\nhim up. "What does General Computers use for their whatchamacallit?"\r\n\r\n"The General Computers\' Incomac uses exactly the same sources of\r\ninformation."\r\n\r\nI said in a bored voice, "What do you do different?"\r\n\r\n"The principles of investment planning are scientific principles, Mr.\r\nBorch, and anybody working in this field must follow them."\r\n\r\nLet\'s hear you desperate, I thought, but my voice just got drier.\r\n"Guess I might as well get an--"\r\n\r\n"Of course there are differences!"\r\n\r\n"Uh--yeah?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, yes! You see, even though the principles are the same, still\r\nif only one company was offering this service to investors--"\r\n\r\n"Then what? It\'d jack up the prices?"\r\n\r\nBut that was over-eager. He backed away immediately: "Certainly\r\nnot, Mr. Borch. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
Who could suggest such a thing? We all know General\r\nComputers\' spotless reputation as one of the most heavily capitalized\r\ncorporations in the country. Besides, by now we should be free of\r\nwild brain-truster theories about the evils of monopoly." He smiled\r\nsanctimoniously.\r\n\r\nI drawled, "So what if only one company was selling these machines?" My\r\nbrother would be grinding his teeth at this follow-up. But I thought I\r\njust about had this salesman boxed. I\'d better! He was catching on.\r\n\r\nHe answered, "Even though the same principles are applied, there are\r\nbound to be individual differences in their application. If all users\r\nof estate planning computers had relations with the same firm, all\r\nthese minor fluctuations would be in the same direction for all of\r\nthem. Although the investment mixes would be far from identical, they\r\nwould be more alike than economic principles require. On the other\r\nhand, the investor who has the courage to associate himself with an\r\nalternate set of analyses may be comparatively alone in the course he\r\nchooses. Thus he may benefit, when this course chances to be better\r\nthan expectations, by having to share the reward with relatively few\r\nothers."\r\n\r\nI had him! I said, "You mean this thing might buy me different stocks\r\nfrom what the G.C. whatchamacallit would?"\r\n\r\n"Why, yes, it would be surprising if there was not at some point a\r\ndifference in the two solutions. That was the point you raised so\r\nwell--"\r\n\r\n"And you mean your answer might make me more money?"\r\n\r\n"Why, yes, in the case--that is, in the way that I was discussing.\r\nMmm-hmm."\r\n\r\n"But then you think G.C. gives out wrong solutions."\r\n\r\n"Not _wrong_--"\r\n\r\n"Solutions that aren\'t the best--that _means_ wrong, huh?"\r\n\r\n"Why, yes, I mean, I suppose that--" He stopped.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI smiled. I dropped my Jed Borch personality (which the little salesman\r\nprobably much preferred). "You know who you\'ve been talking to?"\r\n\r\n"F.T.C.?"\r\n\r\n"An F.T.C. Investigator," I said, professionally. Without waiting for\r\nhim to ask, I showed him my card, with the impressive embossed words\r\nacross the center: "Fair Trade Corps." Then I pressed a button and\r\ninstantly two cops were in the door and at the salesman\'s shoulders.\r\n\r\nThe salesman said, "What\'s the charge?"\r\n\r\n"You know what it is."\r\n\r\n"The charge, please."\r\n\r\nI shrugged. "Fraudulent tendencies; to wit, unfair, untrue, and\r\nscurrilous maligning of a competitive corporate body, individual,\r\nand/or product. Okay, boys."\r\n\r\nThey handcuffed him and hustled him out without even picking up his\r\nluggage and his raincoat. He tried to look confident, but I thought\r\nthe law-abiding public wouldn\'t suffer much longer from the connivings\r\nof Statistomat, Inc. I settled back into the deep chair and turned with\r\na triumphant grin toward the door of the room\'s closet.\r\n\r\nIt opened. My brother, dressed in the distinctive charcoal-green suit\r\nof a General Computers junior executive, stepped out, turning off the\r\ntape recorder as he came.\r\n\r\nHe was grinning too. "You had me biting my lip," he admitted, "but you\r\ncame through all right. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
It\'s a good thing, too. It always gives me a\r\nspecially grateful feeling when I see society saved from a deviant\r\nlike that.... It\'s not that there was any danger they would have\r\nchallenged Incomac\'s market leadership, but even if they had continued\r\nin existence as small as they are now they would have taken away _some_\r\ncustomers. Our responsibility to our stockholders is not just to make\r\nprofit. It is to make the maximum possible profit--to optimize!"\r\n\r\nOf course!\r\n\r\nMy brother\'s gaze was distant as his keen mind searched for the deeper\r\nlessons of the day\'s work. He said, "Maybe we should get the public\r\nrelease of those Commerce Department reports discontinued."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
