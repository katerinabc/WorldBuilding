Through the haze of\r\npoison air that surrounded the planet, Cobber could see them wheel into\r\na semi-circle not more than thirty yards away from him and the airlock\r\nthat he held.\r\n\r\nWilson\'s tank rumbled a few feet forward from the semi-circle.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t dare shoot, Cobber," he said quietly. "You\'re outnumbered\r\nthirty to one.

=== Chunk 2 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Stand back! All of you!" Cobber shouted into the mike. "I\'ll blow up\r\nthe first one that moves!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be a fool, Cobber," Wilson said. "There\'s enough catalytic rock\r\nstored in the ship for all of us. I can make you a rich man. Put down\r\nthose guns and we\'ll forget what has happened. Put down those guns."\r\n\r\n"This ship is not going back to Earth," Cobber said.\r\n\r\n"Put down those guns, Cobber!" Wilson shouted. "You can\'t win!"\r\n\r\nCobber turned the knob and shut off Wilson\'s loud voice. He then opened\r\none of the dinatro bombs that lay beside him, unscrewed the cap and\r\ntossed it into the back of the car with the other neatly stacked-up\r\nexplosives.\r\n\r\n"Ten seconds!" he yelled.\r\n\r\nThe men were stunned for a moment by the suddenness of his decision to\r\nblow up the ship. They stood dumfounded, not knowing what to do, until\r\none of them screamed "Dinatro!" Panic-stricken, they dashed their tanks\r\nfor the meager protection of the nearby cliffs.\r\n\r\nWilson\'s tank stood still, not moving.\r\n\r\n"You\'re bluffing, Cobber," he called out. "You want to scare the men\r\naway so you can seize the ship and get back to Earth. All right,\r\nCobber, you win. Only you and I will share the cargo. I\'m coming in."\r\n\r\nOne second.\r\n\r\nTwo.\r\n\r\nThree.\r\n\r\n"There\'s more than a cargo at stake," Cobber said.\r\n\r\nFour seconds.\r\n\r\nFive.\r\n\r\nSix.\r\n\r\n"Remember me, Kama!" Cobber said softly to himself.\r\n\r\nSeven.\r\n\r\nEight....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe silent bulbous mass that was the Great Kama extended an undulating\r\ngrowing finger and pointed. When Cobber saw the charred bodies of the\r\nKamae he knew what it meant to have one\'s people ravaged and killed.\r\nIn that moment he forget the rosy glow of ammonia snow on the mountain\r\ntops and the purple clouds that battled majestically over the planet.\r\n\r\nHere and there the anhydrous bodies of the Kamae lay stone still. The\r\nsmall village, tucked away by the shores of the russet sea, was wiped\r\nout. Many of the bodies were ripped apart, torn to shreds as if by some\r\nmonster from the depths of the methane sea.\r\n\r\nHe had seen death before and he had seen brother kill brother on a\r\nhundred different planets in as many solar systems. Each time its\r\nhorror and tragedy cut him deep. Cobber felt sick at heart.\r\n\r\n"I did not know ..." he began despairingly.\r\n\r\nHis words were cut short by the overwhelming emotion of pain and hurt\r\nanger that forced itself out of the organ-less body of the Great Kama,\r\nthrough the poison atmosphere of the planet, through the walls of the\r\ntank-car and into Cobber\'s consciousness. It was held back, its power\r\ncould overwhelm him, but Cobber could sense the enormity of the tragedy\r\nthat racked the bubbly form of his Kama friend.\r\n\r\nHe looked through the window of his small car and watched his strange\r\ncomrade leave him, gliding like a living liquid over the knolls and\r\nhills. Other men of Earth could feel only revulsion and disgust when\r\ntheir eyes fell on one of the Kamae. But Cobber was not like other men.\r\n\r\nHe had seen, in the years of his wanderings, enough of creation\'s\r\nmysteries to realize that the surface manifestations and expression\r\nof life were meaningless. Where men like Wilson would reach for a\r\ngun to blast it, Cobber would reach out to it with understanding and\r\nfriendship.\r\n\r\nBe it a crystal that grew into pulsating life with every sun ray, or\r\nthe flesh and blood of Earth, or the singing strings of Orion--it did\r\nnot matter. Life alone made them brothers. It was this realization that\r\nenabled him to be a friend to Kama. It was this knowledge that made him\r\nfeel the immensity of the tragic despair which engulfed his strange\r\nother-world companion.\r\n\r\nGingerly he adjusted the controls of the tank-car so that it would walk\r\ncarefully through the village. Years ago the crude spacesuits with\r\nwhich planetary explorers were encumbered were found to be too clumsy\r\nand dangerous for use. In their place were developed the tank-cars.\r\n\r\nThey were miniature houses on wheels and legs, faintly reminiscent of\r\nancient battle-tanks, equipped for travel on sand, rock, hill, water\r\nand a thousand other fields. Tentacles, mechanical arms and legs were\r\nfinally developed, making the tank-cars a thousand times superior to\r\nclumsy, inefficient spacesuits.\r\n\r\nThe metallic legs of the car, immune to the gaseous atmosphere,\r\ncarefully stepped over the bodies. On the hilltop, through the mist\r\nthat clouded the vision plates of the car, he could see the other\r\nvillages being destroyed, as this one was.\r\n\r\nCobber shuddered. The planet of Kama was like death itself without the\r\nghastly war that had descended upon it.\r\n\r\nSeeing the crimson thunderhead clouds rear high into the stratosphere\r\nand knowing the approach of another storm, he hastened the speed of his\r\ncar towards the huge mother-ship.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn an hour\'s time he found it, half buried among the great ammonia\r\nsnow drifts. He folded the legs of his car, let it descend into a\r\nriding position and, metallic treads rumbling, rode into the airlock\r\nthat opened to meet him. As it rolled in, the wall in back descended,\r\nimprisoning the car.\r\n\r\nHe waited patiently as the poison air was extracted from the lock. When\r\nthe indicators registered the absence of carbon disulphide vapor he\r\nopened the top of his car and crawled out. The door leading into the\r\nairlock opened. Jina\'s face greeted him as Cobber walked through.\r\n\r\n"Welcome home, Cobber!" he said. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
"We were beginning to worry about you."\r\n\r\nCobber tapped his feet experimentally on the floor of the ship. "It\r\nfeels good to stretch out again after fourteen days in the tank. Air\r\nwould have run low soon."\r\n\r\nAs was the ship\'s rule, Jina replaced the empty food drawers, stored up\r\nthe fuel tanks, replenished the air supply and turned to the stacks of\r\ndinatro bombs in the back of the car.\r\n\r\n"Shall I clear these out?" Jina asked.\r\n\r\n"No. Let them stay," Cobber said. Before he could leave the dressing\r\nroom the other officers and members of the crew came into the room.\r\n\r\n"What did you hear?" they asked. Anxiety was written over their faces.\r\nEvidently they had already seen the effects of war. They waited, intent\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\n"The peace is ended among the Kamae," he told them.\r\n\r\n"Is it nation against nation?"\r\n\r\n"No. They have not developed as far as that. Isolated tribes have\r\nattacked others, wiping them out. One by one the advanced cities that\r\nhave schools and teachers are being laid low by wandering bands. I saw\r\nsome of the ruins--"\r\n\r\nHe broke off and, as if seeing them again in his mind, said, "Old and\r\nyoung. Burnt out bodies buried in snow drifts. No prisoners. Savage\r\nwar."\r\n\r\n"Barbarians!" Jina said.\r\n\r\n"Teachers of barbarians!" Cobber said, looking at the men under his\r\ncommand. "They were shown how they might pillage one another in order\r\nto bring catalytic to us for trade. Who else would teach them?\r\n\r\n"I left explicit orders," he said angrily, walking back and forth\r\namong them, "to give only machinery and gas-proof metals in exchange\r\nfor their catalytics. I said there was to be no interference with the\r\nprivate life of the Kamae. Why was I disobeyed?" 

=== Chunk 4 ===
he demanded. "Who told\r\nyou to change the trade agreements that I had prepared?"\r\n\r\nWhen no answer came he looked at his assistant officer.\r\n\r\n"You, Jina. Who handled the trade accounts with the Kamae?"\r\n\r\n"Wilson, sir."\r\n\r\nCobber swore, brushed past his men and made his way to the private\r\nquarters of Fogarth Wilson. Several of the men moved as if to stop him,\r\nbut none dared. In the event of a quarrel between the man who ran the\r\nship and the man who owned it, it was best to stay neutral.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWilson was yawning lazily as Cobber walked in.\r\n\r\n"Hello, Cobber," he greeted casually. "I was afraid your Kamae friends\r\nmight have kept you. What did you find out?

=== Chunk 5 ===
"\r\n\r\nCobber\'s voice shook. "You broke the trade agreement!"\r\n\r\nWilson looked up at him, and saw the anger in his eyes. He got up from\r\nhis bed and walked across the narrow room and stood next to the older\r\nman.\r\n\r\n"Did you see the store room?" he demanded. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
"It\'s one third full. One\r\nthird full after two weeks of trade! We were here six months and got\r\nonly a quarter ton of catalytic for the power machines of Earth. In one\r\nday I purchased more than you could buy in a month!"\r\n\r\n"But at what a price, you fool!"\r\n\r\n"Price? Yes! I sold oxygen!" Wilson laughed. "What did you offer them,\r\nCobber? Books and machinery! Books for a savage king and machinery for\r\nfools! I gave them what they wanted--pure oxygen!"\r\n\r\nCobber prayed for the strength of a man twenty years his junior. But\r\nhis weak and old hands would prove of little value against the youthful\r\nstrength of Wilson.\r\n\r\n"Oxygen! In an atmosphere of carbon disulphide and methane you sell\r\nthem tanks of oxygen!"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"You know what you sell the Kamae?" Cobber asked, gripping him by the\r\nshoulders. "Death! A single spark--one rock striking another, a simple\r\nstroke--and that oxygen becomes a bursting, fuming flame! In this\r\natmosphere it is worse than the most powerful dynamite. Whole villages\r\nhave been wiped out. Entire cities have been burned to the ground by\r\nyour oxygen. You showed them how to use it. You made flame-throwers.\r\nYou showed them how to kill one another to bring you more catalytics\r\nfor more weapons!"\r\n\r\n"Why not?" Wilson demanded. "I sell them what they want--weapons of\r\nwar. In selling it I\'ve made enough to outfit a new ship and a new\r\ncaptain."\r\n\r\nCobber looked again at the man he hated. Unlike other sons of the rich\r\nwho hired ships and captains to squire them in their adventurous tours\r\nof other planets, Wilson was not soft. A sensuous line about his lips\r\nhid their cruelty. Years of breeding and care, without the knowledge of\r\npoverty and the crushing weight of mature responsibility, had given him\r\na smooth powerful body and a quick agile mind that was more callous and\r\nhard than the palms of old Cobber\'s hands.\r\n\r\nWilson owned not only the ship, but Cobber\'s soul as well. There were\r\ndebts to be paid back at home. It was so with every man in the crew.\r\nEach would suffer if Wilson failed to come back safe and sound. Cobber\r\nknew this and Wilson knew it as well. Wilson was the master here--not\r\nCobber.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"I spoke with the Great Kama today," Cobber said, remembering his\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n"Yes. And what did the Messy One have to say?"\r\n\r\n"The learned men of the villages, the educated ones, want revenge for\r\nthe breaking of our trading treaties. They will attack us. They will\r\nbreak off all relations with Earthmen forever unless--"\r\n\r\n"Unless what?"\r\n\r\n"Unless I surrender you to them."\r\n\r\nThere was the beginning of a smile on Wilson\'s lips. It stayed there\r\ngrimly as he watched indecision, hesitation and conflicting emotions\r\nbattle in Cobber\'s eyes.\r\n\r\n"You wouldn\'t dare!" he whispered softly. "In fact," he added, smiling\r\nas the thought gave him reassurance, "in fact, you couldn\'t!" He tried\r\nto smile again, but this time found little weakness in Cobber\'s eyes.\r\n\r\n"The whole future of Kama\'s contact with the Earth depends upon me\r\nnow," Cobber told him, stepping back a foot and then drawing his\r\nancient revolver from his hip pocket.\r\n\r\nWilson looked at the gun calmly. "You\'re a fool, Cobber--a doddering\r\nold fool!" 

=== Chunk 7 ===
he said. "If you had done your work as captain without\r\ninterfering with me I could have made you a rich man."\r\n\r\nAs he talked he gestured with his hand. With a swift, sudden movement\r\nhe slapped the gun from Cobber\'s grip, grasped the old man by his neck\r\nand turned quickly, flinging Cobber against the wall. There was a dull\r\nthud as Cobber collapsed in a crumpled heap.\r\n\r\nWilson switched on the call board. "Attention! All officers please\r\nreport to my quarters immediately. Wilson speaking. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
That is all."\r\n\r\nTurning it off he came back again to the slowly rising Cobber.\r\n\r\n"You\'re finished," he said. "Finished!"\r\n\r\nThe men drifted in one by one. When all had assembled, facing Wilson\r\nand Cobber, the younger man spoke.\r\n\r\n"In view of the critical situation now facing us and the imminence of\r\nan attack by the savage Kamae, I have deemed it advisable to make some\r\nchanges in the commanding personnel of my ship. With due respect for\r\nhis splendid accomplishments in the past, I now relieve Cobber of his\r\nduties as commanding captain of this ship. He will henceforth function\r\nas second assistant navigator. Commanding Captain Jina, you will carry\r\non."\r\n\r\nCobber ripped off the single star that emblazoned his sleeve and gave\r\nit to Jina. He walked past the stunned officers and men, past them all,\r\ninto the corridor, down the steps and to the airlock.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe raging storm above had died. At times a lonely star peered through\r\ncrimson clouds and then, as if frightened at the sight, disappeared\r\nfrom view. White flakes, so reminiscent of snow on Earth, settled\r\nsoftly upon the planet. From time to time he would brush the windows of\r\nhis tankbox and peer out to watch for the approach of his friend.\r\n\r\nHe saw him, a white globule-like mass, slithering over the rolling\r\nhill and coming towards him. He raised one of the arms of the car in\r\nrecognition. Instantly a gray finger extended from the bulbous mass in\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nThe strange being was standing beside the tankbox that enclosed Cobber.\r\nNo message came from its brain as it waited for the thoughts to form in\r\nCobber\'s mind.\r\n\r\n_I am ashamed_, Cobber thought.\r\n\r\nThere was no answer, but a wave of pained bewilderment flooded upon\r\nhim. Then the accusing words, _You failed_.\r\n\r\n_Yes, I failed_, Cobber said, the bitterness of complete defeat\r\nrankling in his heart. _The man your people want for revenge is my\r\nchief. I cannot deliver him. I cannot!_\r\n\r\n_When Cobber first came to our planet_, the Great Kama\'s thoughts rang\r\nin his head, _who welcomed him? Who crossed the barriers between our\r\ndifferent forms of life? Who told Cobber the tragic history of our\r\npeople? Who told him the secrets of our learned teachers?_\r\n\r\nThere was a long pause and then the Great Kama answered his own\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n_I did these things, for I thought Cobber was my friend._\r\n\r\nCobber wanted to shout, "I am your friend, believe me!" but he knew\r\nthat the Great Kama could not look upon him as one single individual\r\napart from his men. He was a symbol, the embodiment of the best that\r\na different people could offer. If Cobber had failed him--Cobber, the\r\nwisest--then friendship between the planets was doomed forever.\r\n\r\n_I gave friendship--and what has Cobber\'s answer been? Your people sold\r\nweapons to the ignorant and brutal of my people. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
You taught them to\r\nkill and burn. You aroused the greed and lust in us with the offer of\r\npower. We reached for knowledge--and you pushed us back into the depths\r\nof savagery. Are you my friend, Cobber?_\r\n\r\nCobber could not answer. Powerless, impotent, he could not fulfill the\r\ndemand for just revenge that Kama had asked. A thousand plans pursued\r\ntheir way through his mind. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
A thousand solutions leapt up, offering\r\nthemselves. He could have killed Wilson and shown them the body. But it\r\nwould have meant death for all them in the courts of Earth.\r\n\r\nWhat was the alternative? 

=== Chunk 11 ===
In his mind he could see the story. The\r\nspaceship would return home with a cargo full of catalytic and the\r\nstory of ignorant beings willing to mine the metal for tanks of oxygen.\r\nCheap, easy to manufacture oxygen in exchange for power! Other ships\r\nwould come and other men like Wilson, greedy men, powerful men, men\r\nwith lust in their hearts.\r\n\r\nKama\'s people, scarcely on the first rung of civilization\'s ladder,\r\nwould be thrust back into the darkness. Tribal warfare, spurred on and\r\nencouraged by Earthmen, would deplete the planet. A new culture, just\r\nborn, would die. Was this a fair price for the greed markets of Earth?\r\n\r\n_Are you my friend?_ He heard the thought again.\r\n\r\nSlowly he rode back to the spaceship. The storm was over. The crew of\r\nthe ship were clearing the ammonia drifts away in preparation for the\r\nblasting.\r\n\r\nThe airlock was open. Cobber rode to it and turned around, guns facing\r\nhis men.\r\n\r\nSix seconds.\r\n\r\nSeven.\r\n\r\n"I am your friend, Kama," Cobber said softly to himself. "Remember me!"\r\n\r\nEight seconds.\r\n\r\nNine.\r\n\r\nThere was a blinding flash of light as jagged white flames reached into\r\na blood-red sky, tearing apart like a paper box the last ship commanded\r\nby Cobber.\r\n\r\nFrom a hilltop in the distance Kama saw the flash and heard the rumble.\r\nWhen it died down the evening silence fell again he knew what Cobber\r\nhad done.\r\n\r\nOther years would bring other ships from Earth. If in them were men\r\nlike Cobber, the barrier between different peoples might yet be crossed.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
