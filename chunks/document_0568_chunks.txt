At any\r\n            rate she was a girl, and Homer had a problem--\r\n\r\n                          A MATTER OF ETHICS\r\n\r\n                         By Russ Winterbotham\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Imagination Stories of Science and Fantasy\r\n                              April 1955\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fly rod, the letter and the small jar of paint were, in a sense,\r\nhalf of the problem Homer Hopkins had to solve. The other half rested\r\nin his complex mind.\r\n\r\nFader\'s Fadeless Formulae had offered him a position, not a job, to\r\ntake charge of its research department, at ten thousand a year, twice\r\nwhat he was paid at Faderfield Junior College to teach chemistry. All\r\nthis was in the letter.\r\n\r\n"But I like being a teacher," said Homer. And he looked at the fly\r\nrod. "And I also like to fish." Teaching chemistry had left him little\r\ntime for fishing. The science had advanced with such gigantic strides\r\nthat Homer was continually catching up on the subject. He spent his\r\nvacations going to colleges, and his off days reading literature,\r\norienting himself.\r\n\r\nThe little jar of paint had brought it about. Homer had sent a jar like\r\nit to C. J. Fader suggesting that it be placed on the market. All Homer\r\nhad wanted was a fat check, and a royalty which he could invest so he\r\ncould retire someday. Instead, C. J. Fader had offered him a job. The\r\nOld Man, who ran the principal industry of Faderfield, would expect a\r\nnew formula a month and Homer was afraid he might not be able to turn\r\none out every month. Homer knew enough about C. J. to realize that if\r\nhe offered ten thousand, he would expect a ninety-thousand profit.\r\nHomer could qualify for the first figure, but he wasn\'t so sure about\r\nthe second.\r\n\r\nAnd then the door bell rang.\r\n\r\nHomer glanced out the window at the row of lighted houses across\r\nthe street. He lived by himself in a little four-room cottage near\r\nthe junior college. Twice a week the cleaning woman got rid of the\r\nmale litter and on Saturdays a student did the outside work to keep\r\nthe little rented home in trim with the rest of the neat little\r\nneighborhood. Homer managed by himself the rest of the time.\r\n\r\nWhoever was at the door was not in line with the window. Callers were\r\nnot infrequent. There were three other bachelor males in the chemistry\r\ndepartment who dropped in occasionally. And some of the neighbors came\r\nover from time to time, usually to borrow a book. Students sometimes\r\ncame to see him, especially when their grades were low.\r\n\r\nHomer opened the door. It was not a bachelor friend. It was not a\r\nneighbor. It was not a student. It was a very pretty young woman. She\r\nwas dressed like she was going to a masquerade, with spangled tights,\r\nor something of that nature, a glittering tiara and shoes covered with\r\nrhinestones.\r\n\r\nHer hair was black and her eyes were brown. There was a faint flush on\r\nher cheeks that looked well with the ivory shade of her smooth skin.\r\n\r\nWithout being invited, she stepped past Homer and into the house. She\r\nlooked around, from floor to the ceiling. She strode across the room\r\nand sank down on Homer\'s overstuffed divan.\r\n\r\n"I like this place," she said. "Do you want to move, or will you share\r\nit with me?"\r\n\r\n"Uh?" Homer laughed nervously. "I beg pardon?"\r\n\r\n"What for? You didn\'t do anything."\r\n\r\n"I meant I misunderstood you," Homer said. "I thought you suggested\r\ntaking my house away from me."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t," said the young woman. "If you want to stay, it\'s all right\r\nwith me. I\'ll only be here a few days. The place is much too large for\r\none person."\r\n\r\nHomer\'s jaw dropped. He closed his mouth and bobbed his adam\'s apple a\r\ncouple of times. But he was beyond words.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShe rose, strode across the room and opened the front door. She stepped\r\nout on the porch and Homer felt a momentary relief. It was an illusion.\r\nC. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
J.\'s offer had been more of a shock than he thought. Then she\r\nappeared again, carrying a black bag.\r\n\r\n"Where will I put my things?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Ma\'am," said Homer. "I am a gentleman." That, he decided, was the best\r\nway to state his position in mixed company.\r\n\r\n"What has that got to do with it? I\'m a lady."\r\n\r\n"Certainly, ma\'am, but you must realize that what you\'re suggesting\r\nis--er--most unorthodox. I don\'t propose to turn my house over to you\r\nwith or without company. Even if--" Homer clamped his jaw shut for he\r\nalmost said that the offer was attractive. How could he have said such\r\na thing? He\'d hardly known this woman for a full minute.\r\n\r\n"Your house? I\'ll admit your arms and legs are yours, and so no doubt\r\nis your hair, your teeth, your eyes and your ears. But how can you say\r\nthis house is yours?"\r\n\r\nHomer looked at the girl. She spoke perfect English although now that\r\nhe noticed there _was_ just a slight accent. She had something of an\r\nItalian grace, French fire, and the wholesome heartiness of Scandinavia\r\nin her, and yet she was different.\r\n\r\n"It is my private property," said Homer. "I\'ll admit I do not own it,\r\nbut I rent it. I have a year\'s lease."\r\n\r\n"When I studied your customs and manners I must have overlooked a few\r\nthings," she said. "But I can\'t see how you can own a dwelling."\r\n\r\nHomer was horrified. Undoubtedly she was from behind the Iron Curtain.\r\n"This is America, ma\'am," he said stiffly.\r\n\r\n"I thought this was the earth," she said.\r\n\r\nAgain Homer\'s jaw dropped as if he had not heard correctly. "Do you\r\nmean that you are from Some Other Place?" His voice supplied capitals.\r\n\r\n"I am assuredly not of _this_ planet," she said. "I\'m Qalith of Planet\r\n12, star 10, Pleiades." Her smile was pleasant too, Homer observed. "I\r\nlearned your language by telepathy but unfortunately I didn\'t go deeply\r\ninto your economics and social customs."\r\n\r\nHomer decided she must have tuned in on Russia, then he realized that\r\nEnglish is not usually spoken there, so he assumed she had listened to\r\nsome subversives somewhere. If she _was_ from the Pleiades. More than\r\nlikely she was a spy. "Do you think the Revolution will come during our\r\nlife-time?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"There is a revolution every twenty-four hours on this planet," she\r\nsmiled. "On my planet the revolution is 26 hours, your hours."\r\n\r\nThis was a joke, Homer decided. A student trick, extremely in bad\r\ntaste. Especially since it entailed a girl to expose herself in such a\r\ncostume.\r\n\r\n"I hope you didn\'t park your spaceship by a fire plug," he said\r\nsarcastically.\r\n\r\n"Fire plug? I missed that when I learned your language. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Something\r\nelectrical, no doubt. But if you mean my space shuttle, it is in\r\na desolate area south of here." She pointed in the direction of\r\nthe Cambridge Manor Country Club. "We know that spaceships have a\r\ndisturbing effect on primitive races such as yours."\r\n\r\nIn spite of Homer\'s determination not to believe this girl, he felt\r\nan admiration in the way she played her role. He wondered if there\r\nwas really a spaceship on the golf course. It would certainly have a\r\ndisturbing effect on early morning golfers. Good heavens! C. J. Fader\r\nbelonged to Cambridge Manor!\r\n\r\n"Miss--er--Qalith," Homer said, "your being here presents problems,\r\nwhether or not you are from the Pleiades! You must understand that this\r\nisn\'t the proper thing to do." Homer glanced toward the window and\r\nquickly moved over to the venetian blinds which he turned downward,\r\njust in case one of the neighbors looked in. "I must sit down and think\r\na moment. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Then we\'ll decide what must be done."\r\n\r\n"I know what I\'m going to do," said Qalith. "So you decide what you\'re\r\ngoing to do."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHomer had a bottle of bourbon in his kitchen cabinet. The board of\r\ntrustees of Faderfield Junior College frowned on faculty drinking of\r\nany sort, and of course alcoholic beverages were forbidden on the\r\ncampus under strictest penalties--expulsion for a student, dismissal\r\nfor an instructor. But Homer was extremely moderate and there were\r\ntimes when he felt that whisky had a respectable place in the scheme of\r\nthings. He poured himself a drink, after offering one to Miss Qalith.\r\nShe declined.\r\n\r\n"I must be careful what I eat and drink on strange planets," she said.\r\n\r\n"A wise forethought," Homer said, with a nod. He mixed the whisky with\r\ntap water, dropped in an ice cube and began sipping it as he sat in a\r\nstraight-backed chair opposite her.\r\n\r\n"Now," he began, "I won\'t question anything you\'ve said. It doesn\'t\r\nmatter really whether you were born in Faderfield, the next county or a\r\nplanet 200 light years distant. There\'s one fact we can\'t deny. You are\r\na woman. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Right?"\r\n\r\n"You are perceptive, sir--"\r\n\r\n"My name\'s Homer," he said. He smiled and she smiled back. Homer\r\nfinished his drink and put aside the glass. "I\'m a man.

=== Chunk 6 ===
"\r\n\r\n"That I had already perceived."\r\n\r\n"Do men and women--ah--occupy the same lodgings on Planet 12?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly. And so do they here. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
I looked in all the houses on this\r\nstreet before I came to yours. I picked your house because you were\r\nalone."\r\n\r\n"But those people are married!" said Homer. "I\'m an unmarried man. A\r\nbachelor."\r\n\r\n"Are you a social outcast? An exile?" Qalith asked.\r\n\r\n"No. I have not chosen a mate--as yet," he didn\'t want her to think he\r\nwas opposed to the idea. "On earth it\'s not customary for an unmarried\r\ncouple--"\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Qalith. "That old thing.

=== Chunk 8 ===
"\r\n\r\nHomer felt a little indignant. "It isn\'t to be ignored."\r\n\r\n"Far be it from me to upset the earth," she said. "I just dropped in\r\nfor a brief time to complete our museum catalog of your system. We\'re\r\nnot complete on the earth, you see, and your little village seemed to\r\nhave a pretty fair representation of human society, except a lack of\r\nprimitive tribes. Now I\'m not so sure it is anything but primitive."\r\n\r\n"We are civilized," said Homer. "Highly civilized. We have a certain\r\nmoral code and your being with me jeopardizes my position in respect\r\nto that code." He paused. "If anyone saw you here, I\'d be disgraced. I\r\ncouldn\'t face my fellow citizens." He added mentally that he wouldn\'t\r\nget that job with Fader\'s Fadeless Formulae if he wanted it.\r\n\r\n"Is that why you closed the blinds?"\r\n\r\nHomer nodded.\r\n\r\n"It would seem to me to be worse if people knew I was here and didn\'t\r\nsee us," she said. "But I\'m new to your planet and I still have a\r\nproblem. Where will I stay?

=== Chunk 9 ===
"\r\n\r\nHomer thought quickly. "There\'s a rooming house where some of the lady\r\nteachers stay." He paused, looked at her spangled costume and shook his\r\nhead. "But your clothes wouldn\'t be understood. They\'d think you were a\r\nburlesque queen."\r\n\r\n"A burlesque queen?"\r\n\r\n"Another thing you\'d never understand," said Homer. "If I could find\r\nthe proper clothes, I could say you were a cousin from Des Moines--"\r\n\r\n"What is a cousin from Des Moines?"\r\n\r\nHomer shook his head. "You\'d give away the show."\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you say I\'m from another planet?"\r\n\r\n"No one would believe it. In fact, I\'m not sure I believe it myself."\r\n\r\n"If Earthlings won\'t believe the truth, why not let me stay here? No\r\none would believe I did."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t understand," Homer groaned. "There\'s such a thing as\r\ncustom. Moral law. Ethics. Social behavior. There are ways a person can\r\nact because to act otherwise is not the thing to do. Certain things\r\ncannot be done and people are quick to suspect that they are being done\r\nsometimes when they\'re not being done. Am I clear?

=== Chunk 10 ===
"\r\n\r\n"No," said Qalith. "But the earth file in our museum is going to be a\r\nlarge one."\r\n\r\nSuddenly the phone rang. Homer jumped and knocked his empty glass to\r\nthe floor. Quickly he rose and lifted the phone.\r\n\r\n"This is Fader, Hopkins," came a voice over the wire. "About my\r\nletter--"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, C. J. It came today."\r\n\r\n"This is a big thing, my boy."\r\n\r\n"I know it is, C. J."\r\n\r\n"I want to get started on it immediately."\r\n\r\n"To be frank, C. J., I wanted a little time to think it over."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll make it twelve thousand if you make up your mind now--tonight,"\r\nFader said. "I\'m going to expand. I\'ll make Fader\'s Fadeless the\r\nbiggest line of paints in the world, but I\'ve got to have research.\r\nYou\'ve convinced me you can do the job--"\r\n\r\n"Can\'t I call you back C. J.? I just want to study this thing--" And\r\nget rid of Qalith, Homer told himself.\r\n\r\n"No! I\'m coming over to talk to you." There was a click in the receiver\r\nand Homer held a silent phone.\r\n\r\n"A funny instrument," said Qalith, "It\'ll never take the place of\r\ntelepathy."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHomer put the phone back in its cradle, and picked up the empty liquor\r\nglass. He took it to the kitchen. It wasn\'t the first thing he had to\r\ndo, but C. J. might not approve so Homer had to get it out of sight. He\r\nclosed the kitchen cabinet door so the whisky was out of sight. Then he\r\nwent to the living room and saw that Qalith was unpacking her bag.\r\n\r\nHomer could see the spangles of garments like the one she wore. She was\r\nsetting out small boxes, which looked a great deal like boxes of things\r\nthat women always carry--perfume, cosmetics, and so on.\r\n\r\n"No, no, no!" Homer shouted. "You mustn\'t unpack your bag! C. J. will\r\nbe here any minute."\r\n\r\n"I was here first," said Qalith.\r\n\r\n"Listen, Qalith," said Homer, "On your planet there must be certain\r\nrules of conduct that may seem outlandish when considered alone, but\r\nhave very good reason for being when you consider them in the light of\r\nother facts."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes," said Qalith. "One should always wear a telepathy helmet when\r\nhe\'s keeping a secret."\r\n\r\nHomer took Qalith by the arm, led her to the divan and sat down beside\r\nher. Quickly and pointedly he told her about Fader\'s Fadeless Formulae\r\nand the opportunity that faced him. And he gave her the Facts of life.\r\n\r\n"The only drawback is that old skinflint Fader himself," Homer\r\nexplained. "As I\'m fixed now, I have a pleasant job. The dean\'s nice\r\nand easy going. I get along fine and I like my work. Fader will pay me\r\ntwice as much, but he\'ll be breathing down my neck every minute, making\r\nsure he\'s making a 90 per cent profit on everything I do."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t know whether to take a job in which you\'ll be unhappy, but\r\nwhich can give you what you want or to stay on a job where you\'ll be\r\nhappy, but poor. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
Is that it?" Qalith looked at him with a curious\r\nexpression in her eyes.\r\n\r\n"That\'s it," said Homer.\r\n\r\nThe front doorbell rang and Homer realized he\'d spent more time\r\nexplaining to Qalith than he should have spent. He jumped to his feet.\r\nHis arms swept up the boxes and piled them into the bag. He lifted the\r\nbag and ran to the kitchen. "Hide, Qalith! Hide quickly! In the bedroom\r\nand close the door!" he said.\r\n\r\nHe thrust the bag in the broom closet off the kitchen.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned he saw Qalith admitting C. J. Fader at the front door.\r\n\r\n"Harrumph!" said Mr. Fader. His eyes traveled over Qalith from spangled\r\nboots to gleaming tiara.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Fader," said Homer thickly.\r\n\r\n"I must have arrived more quickly than you anticipated," said Fader. He\r\nstepped forward and nudged Homer. "You sly young dog."\r\n\r\n"It\'s not what you think, C. J.," said Homer.\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t said a word about what I thought," said Fader. "What I want\r\nto know is where you found her."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t--"\r\n\r\n"I\'m from another planet," said Qalith.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll say you are, baby," said Fader, chucking her under the chin. "You\r\nknow, Homer here had me fooled. But I can see he\'s not as namby pamby\r\nas I thought. Yes, sir! 

=== Chunk 12 ===
He\'s quite a boy."\r\n\r\n"He\'s been explaining all of the manners and customs of the earth to\r\nme," said Qalith.\r\n\r\n"And I\'ll bet he knows how!" said Fader.\r\n\r\n"It\'s really the truth," said Homer. "Qalith is from the Pleiades."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes! 

=== Chunk 13 ===
Near Cincinnati! Well I always heard those Cincy girls were\r\npretty cute. Playing at the Roxy?

=== Chunk 14 ===
"\r\n\r\nHomer shuddered. "She\'s left her spaceship on the Cambridge Manor golf\r\nlinks," he said.\r\n\r\nMr. Fader roared. "Homer, you\'re a man after my own heart! I\'ll tell\r\nyou what, boy. You come into my organization and I\'ll make you a vice\r\npresident with a big chunk of stock. You can have charge of research\r\nand if you can line up the babes for our conventions we\'ll put the\r\nwhole dammed paint trade in our pocket inside of two years! After all,\r\nboy, it\'s girls and salesmen, not the quality of your product that win\r\non today\'s market!"\r\n\r\nSlowly the idea sank into Homer\'s brain. 

=== Chunk 15 ===
Mr. Fader hadn\'t wanted to\r\nhire him because he was anything special as a chemist.\r\n\r\n"How much will I get?" Homer asked bluntly.\r\n\r\n"The stock ought to be worth twelve thousand a year," said Fader. "On\r\ntop of that you\'ll get twenty-five thousand as vice president in charge\r\nof research and conventions."\r\n\r\nAnd the ten thousand that Homer hoped to get had been cheap. Ten\r\nthousand for a chemist, twenty-five for a salesman, plus a bundle of\r\nstock. A high priced pimp.\r\n\r\n"Are you sure I\'ll be worth it?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t talk like a nincompoop, boy! 

=== Chunk 16 ===
We\'re in." He turned to Qalith.\r\n"Got any friends, honey?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nQalith\'s eyes seemed to gleam. Fader\'s hand straightened with a jerk.\r\nHe stood stiffly.\r\n\r\n"He\'s hypnotized," said Qalith. "We can talk and he won\'t hear or\r\nremember what we say."\r\n\r\n"There\'s not much to be said," said Homer.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t want the job?"\r\n\r\n"With this lecherous old tom-cat?"\r\n\r\nQalith smiled. "You are Puritanical," she said. "You\'re stuffy and\r\nnaive and innocent. But I like you."\r\n\r\n"I\'m probably crazy too," said Homer.\r\n\r\nQalith shook her head. "No. 

=== Chunk 17 ===
You\'re unhappy. You don\'t like being a\r\nteacher either, do you?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I do!" Homer spoke with too much emphasis. "It\'s a pleasant\r\nlife."\r\n\r\n"But you\'ve seen broken old men teaching. Men who had brains and who\r\ndidn\'t have a cent in their savings account. You know you\'ll starve all\r\nyour life and get very little thanks for discovering genius. You know\r\nand you want to get away from it. That\'s why you even considered going\r\nwith Fader in the first place. If you\'d really been contented you\'d\r\nhave turned him down right off."\r\n\r\nHomer realized she spoke the truth. "But any job has its drawbacks.\r\nI\'ve either got to teach chemistry or become a research chemist.\r\nFrom what I\'ve seen, Fader and Faderfield Junior College are my only\r\nchoices. And Chemistry is all I know."\r\n\r\n"You know about ethics and customs of your planet. You know what people\r\nare supposed to do and rarely do."\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t make a living for me."\r\n\r\n"Not on earth. But on Planet 12, you\'d be an authority on the planet\r\nEarth. The only authority because you know all about the earth\'s unkept\r\nlaws of social conduct and you\'re one of the few that ever kept those\r\nlaws."\r\n\r\nOne thing held Homer back. "Is your planet really communistic? Don\'t\r\nyou have private property?"\r\n\r\n"Do you own this house?"\r\n\r\n"Well I rent it, but some people do own their houses."\r\n\r\n"Are you sure?"\r\n\r\n"Well, they have mortgages and taxes and so on."\r\n\r\n"Actually very few people own what they think they have, excepting\r\ntheir bodies."\r\n\r\n"But men move in with women and women move in with men--"\r\n\r\n"This thing you call marriage corresponds with a custom we have," said\r\nQalith. "I was going to marry you."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know you and you don\'t know me!"\r\n\r\n"How do you think I found you without telepathy? And you\'ve seen me\r\nnow--is there anything wrong about me that--well, that--"\r\n\r\n"Nothing!" Homer said fervently. He thought of people who had courted\r\nmany years and still didn\'t know each other. Then he glanced down at\r\nFader, still staring hypnotically. "What a tale he\'s going to spread\r\nabout town tomorrow!" Homer said.\r\n\r\n"He won\'t believe it," said Qalith.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be gone," said Homer.\r\n\r\n"Then we\'d better get going. You can work on the earth file on the trip\r\nto the Pleiades."\r\n\r\n"Says you," said Homer. He got her bag from the broom closet and as\r\nan afterthought, he picked up his rod and tackle. Maybe he\'d get some\r\nfishing done on Planet 12, among other things--\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
