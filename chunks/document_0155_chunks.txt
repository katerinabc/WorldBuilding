Considering this\r\n    two-time Air Force officer\'s output, however--ranging from\r\n    upper-bracket love and auto-racing tales to a brilliant new novel,\r\n    TROUBLING OF A STAR, that has won major bookclub distribution, and\r\n    including scores of fine science fiction stories--we wonder whether\r\n    this peripatetic author may not be planning to flood all markets.\r\n    Not a bad idea._\r\n\r\n\r\n    this\r\n      is\r\n    klon\r\n calling\r\n\r\n _by ... Walt Sheldon_\r\n\r\n\r\n One sure way to live dangerously is to become a practical joker.\r\n Should you have any doubts about it you might ask Professor Dane.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou didn\'t have to be a potential Einstein to take Professor Dane\'s\r\ncourse. For one thing you got a few easy credits and for another you\r\nwere entertained--without letup--by Professor Lyman Dane\'s celebrated\r\nwit.\r\n\r\nTake the time he was illustrating terminal velocity. He jumped out of\r\nthe open third story window, horrifying the class, until they learned\r\nhe\'d rigged a canvas life net on the floor below. Or the time he let a\r\nmouse loose among the female students to illustrate chain reaction. Or\r\nthe afternoon he played boogie-woogie on the Huyler Memorial Carillon.\r\n\r\n"The absorption of knowledge," he used to say, "increases in direct\r\nproportion to the sense of humor--the belly laugh, measured in decibels,\r\nbeing constant."\r\n\r\nHe could say a thing like that and make it sound funnier than anybody\r\nelse could. It was partly the way he looked--tall and mournful and sly,\r\nwith wispy hair that had once been blond, drooping like a tired willow\r\nover his forehead.\r\n\r\nBut for all his vaudeville tactics he was by no means a second-rate\r\nscientist. Which was why he had gained his position at Southwestern\r\nTech in the first place. He refused to work directly for the government\r\n(no sense of humor, just initials, he said) but this way he could at\r\nleast be called upon for consultation at the nearby Air Force\r\nDevelopment Center, just at the foot of the mountains to the west.\r\n\r\nNow the AFDC, as it was called, didn\'t advertise what sort of thing it\r\nwas developing--but everybody knew that Lyman Dane was an expert on\r\nreactive propulsion of rocket motors. He could tell you--and frequently\r\nwould without being asked--exactly what mass ratio, nozzle diameter and\r\npropulsive velocity would be needed for the first trip to the Moon. He\r\nknew how many hours a round trip would take, both for landing there or\r\nmerely circling the body of the satellite.\r\n\r\nHe had the courses to Mars and Venus thoroughly charted--but considered\r\na trip to Jupiter somewhat impractical. So, what with Dane\'s presence\r\nand the mysterious white streaks that so often shot up into the sky like\r\nfuzzy yarn from the AFDC base, it wasn\'t hard to guess what was going\r\non.\r\n\r\nNevertheless Professor Dane was surprised and somewhat offended when the\r\nyoung man from the Federal Bureau of Investigation came to call on him\r\none afternoon. And the worst part of it was that the young man didn\'t\r\nhave much sense of humor.\r\n\r\n"As you know, sir," the young man said, "we\'ve been sighting and\r\ntracking these unidentified objects in the sky. You must have read about\r\nthose they chased near Atlanta yesterday."\r\n\r\n"Ah," said Professor Dane. "Martian through Georgia, no doubt."\r\n\r\nThe young man stared at him blankly. He seemed to Professor Dane one of\r\nthe most nondescript young men his eyes had ever beheld. He had a\r\nclean-shaven, pleasant face without exactly being handsome and his eyes\r\nwere sincere and mild. He wore a neat gray tropical worsted suit and an\r\nunobtrusive tie. He was about thirty. Professor Dane supposed that all\r\nthis was an advantage in his profession.\r\n\r\nThe young man went on--earnestly. "Without forming any theories about\r\nthese things we\'ve been asked to take certain precautions. I don\'t know\r\nwhether they suspect a hostile power, or what. That\'s not my job. At any\r\nrate I\'ve been given the responsibility of instituting certain security\r\ntechniques. You do after all, sir, have access to and knowledge of\r\nconsiderable classified information."\r\n\r\nThis lad reminded him somewhat of his old friend and colleague, Dr.\r\nFincher, out in California. Wally Fincher was a well-known physicist\r\nnow, though how anyone ever managed to struggle through his dry\r\nponderous books Dane didn\'t know. Probably he had gained most of his\r\nfame through his part in those experiments where they bounced radar\r\nblips off the moon, Dane thought.\r\n\r\nWally always talked in long unnecessary words. He never merely "went"\r\nwhen he could "proceed," he never simply "used" when it was possible to\r\n"utilize," he didn\'t "get things done"--he "implemented" them. Professor\r\nDane made a mental note to put in a long distance call to Wally that\r\nevening and tweak his nose a bit. Maybe Dane could pretend he was the\r\nFBI--disguise his voice and interrogate Wally, as though he were\r\ninvestigating him. He chuckled a little at the idea. Then he realized\r\nthat the young man had been talking and he hadn\'t been listening.\r\n\r\n"... so among other things, sir, we thought it best to monitor your\r\nofficial mail and hope you won\'t mind."\r\n\r\n"What?" said Dane, raising his eyebrows.\r\n\r\n"_And_ your phone. You\'ll hear a couple of clicks whenever you use it.\r\nWe\'re recording what\'s said over it--though I assure you all records\r\nobtained will be kept in strictest confidence."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDane acquiesced. The young man finally managed to make it clear that all\r\nthis surveillance would have to be with Dane\'s permission and the\r\nprofessor, annoyed though he was, didn\'t want to appear uncooperative.\r\nHe couldn\'t resist, however, giving the young man the wrong hat when he\r\nwent out and being delighted when the young man came back for the right\r\none five minutes later. He was glad to see that something could fluster\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nBut that wasn\'t really enough. Professor Dane had been annoyed, and he\r\nneeded to express himself further--by means of the joke, which was his\r\nart--in order to regain some measure of his equilibrium and\r\nself-respect.\r\n\r\nInspiration visited him as he was climbing the stairs to his bedroom at\r\nten-thirty that evening. He stopped short, thought a minute, then began\r\nto chuckle. He turned and went downstairs again, stepped to the phone.\r\nProfessor Dane lived alone and no one else would be able to share his\r\nplanned joke--but this didn\'t matter.\r\n\r\nHe had been privately enjoying his pranks ever since, as a frail boy\r\nwith an unreasonable and dominating male parent, he had discovered that\r\nthey were one way in which he could compete with hardier souls, at times\r\neven surpass them. Never mind the audience, he thought.

The jest was the\r\nthing!\r\n\r\nIt was an hour earlier in Los Angeles and Dr. Wallace Fincher was at\r\nhome. Dane disguised his voice--he did a lot of University Theater work\r\nand this kind of thing came to him easily. He listened first to Dr.\r\nFincher\'s arid, humorless, "Hello. Dr. Fincher speaking." Then he heard\r\nthe preliminary clicking, just as the FBI man had predicted.\r\n\r\n"Thandor," said Professor Dane, "this is Klon calling."\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon?" said Doctor Fincher.\r\n\r\n"The jig\'s up," said Professor Dane. "Captain Ixl in propul-cruiser\r\nnine-nine-seven-three will never be able to break through. The\r\nEarthlings have set up a close watch--they\'re suspicious.

=== Chunk 3 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Who is this?" Doctor Fincher sounded startled. "Who the devil is this\r\ncalling?"\r\n\r\nDane could barely keep his laughter from breaking into his voice.\r\n"Thandor, we can come to no conclusion but that the Terrestrials are\r\ndefinitely hostile. We should have expected that from their primitive\r\nstage of development. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
They have orders to shoot any of our\r\npropul-cruisers they can catch. I suggest that we withdraw all ships of\r\nthe Franistan class immediately from their free orbits and send them on\r\na standard Keplerian course to the home planet for further\r\nconsultation."\r\n\r\n"_Is this some kind of joke?_" Fincher sounded as if he were almost\r\npanicky.\r\n\r\n"Furthermore," said Dane, "I recommend that we withdraw all agents from\r\nEarth. We can\'t conceal our superior mental development and advanced\r\ntechnology much longer.\r\n\r\n"Someone\'s bound to catch on pretty soon. I was against this plan in the\r\nGalactic Council in the first place, you\'ll remember. Well, farewell,\r\nThandor! 

=== Chunk 5 ===
I\'ll be seeing you soon in space!"\r\n\r\nAnd Professor Dane hung up before he exploded with laughter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe laughed until the tears came to his eyes. He held his stomach with\r\nboth hands.

He was weak. He supported himself on the stair railing and\r\nfor minutes was unable to take the first tread. With his lively\r\nscientist\'s imagination he could picture the completely bewildered look\r\non the young FBI man\'s face when he listened to this conversation on the\r\ntape recorder or whatever it was they used.\r\n\r\nHe was certainly going to have to try to get that recording from them.\r\nPlay it back for Fincher some time--Lordy, Fincher would have apoplexy\r\nevery time he heard it!\r\n\r\nHe finally gained enough strength to climb the stairs. He went into his\r\nbedroom, still chuckling weakly, still wiping the tears from his eyes,\r\nstomach muscles still aching.\r\n\r\nDr. Wallace Fincher stood there by his bed. It _was_ Fincher--the same\r\nstocky round-faced man with the steel-rimmed glasses he had always\r\nknown. It was either Fincher or the darndest hallucination he had\r\never ...\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry, Lyman," said Dr. Fincher in a kindly but impersonal voice.\r\n"You were getting a trifle too close. I\'m afraid you have left me no\r\nchoice."\r\n\r\nHe pointed a little silvery tube at Professor Dane and there was a soft\r\nbuzzing and the smell of ozone and Professor Dane was no longer in the\r\nroom--or anywhere else.\r\n\r\nDr. Fincher sighed, adjusted his glasses and faded into the dimension\r\nthat would take him back to Los Angeles and his interrupted work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ Aug-Sept 1953.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.
