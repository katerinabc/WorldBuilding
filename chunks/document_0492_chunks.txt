]\r\n\r\n\r\nWith all kinds of plots twisting in my head, I hadn\'t slept well the\r\nnight before. For one thing, I\'d worked too late on a yarn that wasn\'t\r\nworth it. For another, there\'d been a high wind howling through the\r\nstreets. It made me restless and did a lot more damage than that. When\r\nI got up I found it\'d blown a lot of paper and junk in the window and\r\nmost of the story out--only a part of the carbon was left. I wasn\'t\r\nespecially sorry. I got dressed and hustled down to the luncheon.\r\n\r\nThat luncheon\'s something special. We meet every Tuesday in a\r\nsecond-rate restaurant and gossip and talk story and editors and mostly\r\nbeef about the mags that won\'t pay until publication. Some of us, the\r\nhigh-class ones, won\'t write for them.\r\n\r\nMaybe I ought to explain. We\'re the unromantic writers--what they call\r\npulp writers. We\'re the boys who fill the pulp magazines with stories\r\nat a cent a word. Westerns, mystery, wonder, weird, adventure--you know\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nNot all of us are hacks. A couple have graduated to the movies. A few\r\nhave broken the slicks and try to forget the lean years. Some get four\r\ncents a word and try to feel important to literature. The rest come to\r\nthe luncheon and either resign themselves to the one cent rate or nurse\r\na secret Pulitzer Prize in their bosoms.\r\n\r\nThere wasn\'t much of a turn-out when I got there. Belcher sat at the\r\nhead of the table as usual, playing the genial host. He specializes\r\nin what they call science-fiction. It\'s fantastic stuff about time\r\nmachines and the fourth dimension. Belcher talks too much in a Southern\r\ndrawl.\r\n\r\nAs I eased into a chair he called, "Ah, the poor man\'s Orson Welles!"\r\nand crinkled his big face into a showy laugh.\r\n\r\nI said, "Your dialogue\'s getting as lousy as your stories!" I don\'t\r\nlike to be reminded that I look like a celebrity.\r\n\r\nBelcher ignored that. He turned to Black, the chap who agents our\r\nstuff, and began complaining.\r\n\r\nHe said, "Land-sake, Joey, can\'t you sell that Martian story? I think\r\nit\'s good." Before Joey could answer, Belcher turned to the rest of us\r\nand said, "Reminds me of my grand-daddy. He got shot up at Vicksburg\r\nbefore his father could locate him and drag him back home. Granny\r\nused to say, \'All my life I\'ve believed in the solid South and the\r\nDemocratic Party. I believed they were good; and if they aren\'t, I\r\ndon\'t want to know about it.\'"\r\n\r\nBelcher laughed and shook his head. I gave Joey a frantic S.O.S. When\r\nBelcher gets going on the Civil War, no one else gets a word in for\r\nsolid hours.\r\n\r\nJoey didn\'t move, but he said, "What story?" very incredulously, and\r\nthen he glanced at me and winked.\r\n\r\n"That Martian story," Belcher said. "The one about the colony on Mars\r\nand the new race of Earth-Mars men that springs up--I\'ve forgotten the\r\ntitle. They say Fitz-James O\'Brien never could remember the titles of\r\nhis stories either."\r\n\r\nJoey said, "You never gave me any such yarn," and this time he really\r\nmeant it.\r\n\r\nBelcher said, "You\'re crazy."\r\n\r\nDown at the other end of the table someone wanted to know who O\'Brien\r\nwrote for.\r\n\r\nI said, "He\'s dead. He wrote \'The Diamond Lens.\'"\r\n\r\n"He was the first pulp writer," Belcher said. "Most folks believe Poe\r\ninvented the short story. Land-sake! Poe never wrote a short story. He\r\nwrote mood pieces. O\'Brien was the first. He wrote great short stories\r\nand great pulp stories."\r\n\r\nI said, "If you\'re looking for the father of the pulp industry, why\r\ndon\'t you go back far enough? There was a boy named Greene in the late\r\nSixteenth Century."\r\n\r\n"You mean \'Groatsworth of Wit\' Greene?"\r\n\r\n"The very same. Only forget that piece of junk. It was his last grab at\r\na dollar. Get hold of a catalogue some day and see the quantity of pulp\r\nhe poured out to make a living. Pamphlets and plays and what not."\r\n\r\nSomeone said, "Greene a pulp writer?" He sounded shocked.\r\n\r\nI said, "Brother, when he turned that stuff out, it was pulp. Passes\r\nthree hundred years and it turns into literature. You figure it out."\r\n\r\nBelcher waved his hand. "I was talking about the invention of the short\r\nstory," he said. "O\'Brien--"\r\n\r\nI tried to cut him off. "I thought O\'Brien predated Poe."\r\n\r\nIt was a mistake. Belcher said, "Not at all. O\'Brien fought in the\r\nCivil War. He was with the Thirty-seventh Georgian Rifles, I believe.

A\r\ncaptain. He--"\r\n\r\nI nudged Joey so hard he yelped, but he said, "I tell you I never\r\nreceived any such story!"\r\n\r\nThen Mallison grunted and sipped his drink. He started to talk and\r\nwe missed the first few words. It\'s always that way with Mallison.\r\nHe\'s white-haired, incredibly ancient-looking, and he acts half dead.\r\nHe used to be in the navy so he writes sea stories now. They say he\r\nacquired a peculiar disease in the tropics that makes him mumble most\r\nof the time. He turns out a damned good yarn.\r\n\r\nFinally we figured out Mallison was calling Joey a liar.\r\n\r\n"Say, what is this?" Joey said indignantly. "Are you kidding?"\r\n\r\nMallison mumbled something about Joey stealing a story of his that\r\nnever got paid for and never showed up. Belcher nodded and poured wine\r\nfrom a bottle. He always drinks a cheap kind of stuff with the greatest\r\nostentation. He acts as though it makes you more important if your\r\ndrink comes out of a bottle instead of from a glass on a tray.\r\n\r\nHe said, "I\'ll bet some mag paid two cents for it, Joey, and you\'re\r\nholding out."\r\n\r\nJoey snorted. "You better look in your desk, Belcher. You probably\r\nforgot to give me the yarn."\r\n\r\nBelcher shook his head. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
"I know I haven\'t got it. I can\'t think how I\r\nlost it--"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe broke off and glanced up at some people who were threading through\r\nthe restaurant toward our table. There came a man followed by a couple.\r\nThe lone man I knew, although I never remember his name. He\'s a quiet\r\nlittle fellow who smokes what looks like his father\'s pipe. Joey says\r\nhe\'s past forty and still lives with his folks, who treat him like a\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nOne of the pair was Jinx MacDougal. He turns out a fantastic quantity\r\nof detective fiction. None of his yarns are outstanding; in fact\r\nthey\'re all on a consistent pulp level. That happens to be why he sells\r\nso much. Editors can always depend on Jinx never to fail them.\r\n\r\nJinx had a stranger with him. He was a tall, slender young man with\r\nscanty, tow-colored hair. He wore thick glasses that made his eyes look\r\nblurry and he was dressed in a sweater and ridiculously tight little\r\nknickers. He smiled shyly, and I could swear his teeth were false, they\r\nwere so even.\r\n\r\nI said, "You\'ve got a helluva nerve, Jinx, if this guy\'s an editor."\r\nAnd I really meant it. Editors are taboo at the luncheon, it being the\r\nonly chance we get to knock them in unison.\r\n\r\nJinx said, "Hi, everybody! This here\'s a white man that\'ll interest\r\nyou. Name of Dugan. Found him up in one of the publishing offices\r\ntrying to locate the pulp slaves. Says he\'s got a story.

=== Chunk 5 ===
"\r\n\r\nI said, "Pass, friend, and have a drink on us."\r\n\r\nJinx sat and Dugan sat. He smiled again and gazed at us eagerly as\r\nthough we were the flower of American Letters. Then he studied the\r\ntable and it looked as though he were itemizing the plates and glasses\r\nall the while Jinx was making introductions.\r\n\r\nBelcher said, "Another customer for you, Joey. Even if Jinx hadn\'t\r\ngiven it away, I could have told you he was a writer. Land-sakes! I can\r\nsmell the manuscript in his back pocket."\r\n\r\nDugan looked embarrassed. He said, "Oh no--Really--I\'ve just got a\r\nstory idea, so to speak, I--"\r\n\r\nHe said at lot more but I couldn\'t understand him. He mumbled something\r\nlike Mallison, only his speech was very sharp and clipped. It sounded\r\nlike a phonograph record with every other syllable cut out.\r\n\r\nJinx said, "Dugan comes from your home town, Mallison."\r\n\r\n"Whereabouts?" Mallison asked.\r\n\r\n"Knights Road."\r\n\r\n"Knights Road? You sure?"\r\n\r\nDugan nodded.\r\n\r\nMallison said, "Hell, man, that\'s impossible. Knights Road starts\r\noutside the town and runs through the old quarry."\r\n\r\n"Oh--" Dugan looked flustered. "Well, there\'s a new vention."\r\n\r\n"A new what?"\r\n\r\n"Vention--" Dugan stopped. Then he said, "A new development. That\'s a\r\nslang word."\r\n\r\nMallison said, "Why, man, I was back home less than a month ago. Wasn\'t\r\nany development then."\r\n\r\nBelcher said, "Maybe it\'s very new."\r\n\r\nDugan didn\'t say anything more. I hadn\'t listened much because I was\r\nbusy watching his fingers. He had one hand partially concealed under\r\nthe table, but I could see that he was fumbling nervously with an odd\r\ncontraption that looked like a piece of old clock.\r\n\r\nIt was a square of metal the size of a match box, and at one end was\r\na coil of wire like a watch-spring. On both faces of the box were\r\ntiny buttons, like adding machine keys. Dugan kept jiggling the thing\r\nabsently, and pressing the buttons. I could hear the syncopated clicks.\r\n\r\nI thought, _This guy is really soft in the head. He plays with things._\r\n\r\nBelcher said, "Sure you\'re not a writer?"\r\n\r\nDugan shook his head, then glanced at Joey. Joey smiled a little and\r\nturned away because he\'s very shy about ethics and such. He doesn\'t\r\nwant people to think he runs around trying to get writers on his string.\r\n\r\nMallison said to Jinx, "Well, what in hell is this story?"\r\n\r\nJinx said, "I don\'t know. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Ask him."\r\n\r\nThey all looked at Junior G-Man. I wanted to warn him not to spill\r\nanything because pulp writers are leeches. They\'ll suck the blood right\r\nout of your brain. You have to copyright your dialogue at the Tuesday\r\nluncheons.\r\n\r\nDugan said, "It\'s--it\'s about a Time Machine."\r\n\r\nWe all groaned and I didn\'t worry about Dugan\'s ideas any more after\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nJoey said, "Oh God, not that! The market\'s sick of time stories. You\r\ncouldn\'t sell one with Shakespeare\'s name on it."\r\n\r\nDugan actually looked startled.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter?" Belcher asked, showing off his erudition. "You\r\ngot a manuscript with Shakespeare\'s name on it? Discover a Shakespeare\r\nautograph on a pulp story?" He laughed uproariously as though he\'d\r\ncracked a joke at my expense.\r\n\r\nDugan said, "N-no--only that\'s the story. I mean--" He faltered and\r\nthen said, "I wish you\'d let me just tell you this story."\r\n\r\nWe said, "Sure, go ahead."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Well," Dugan began, "perhaps it isn\'t very original at that, but\r\nit\'s what you might call provocative. The scene is the Twenty-third\r\nCentury--over three hundred years from now. At a great American\r\nuniversity, physicists have devised a--a Time Machine. It\'s a startling\r\ninvention, of course, just as the invention of electric light was\r\nstartling; but its operation is based on sane physical laws--"\r\n\r\n"Never mind the explanations," Belcher interrupted. "We\'ve all alibied\r\na Time Machine at one time or another. Land-sakes! You don\'t even have\r\nto any more. You just write \'Time Machine\' and the readers take the\r\nrest for granted."\r\n\r\n"When the story begins," Dugan continued, "the machine has been in use\r\nfor several years. But for the first time it\'s to be used for literary\r\npurposes. This is because back in the first half of the Twentieth\r\nCentury there lived a great writer. He was so great that modern critics\r\ncall him the New Shakespeare. He\'s called that not only for his genius,\r\nbut because, like the original Shakespeare, almost nothing is known of\r\nhis life."\r\n\r\nMallison said, "That\'s impossible.

=== Chunk 7 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Not altogether," I argued. "It\'s conceivable that wars and\r\nunprecedented bombings and fires could destroy records. Why even today\r\nthere are gaps in the lives of contemporary artists that will never be\r\nfilled up."\r\n\r\n"To hell with that!" 

=== Chunk 8 ===
Mallison said. "I still say it\'s impossible."\r\n\r\nDugan gave me a grateful look. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
He said, "Anyway, that\'s about what\r\nhappened. The literature department of the university is going to send\r\none of its research men back through time to gather material on the\r\nlife of the new Shakespeare. This man is an expert in ancient English.\r\nHe\'s shuttled back into the Twentieth Century, equipped with camera and\r\nstenographic devices and all that. In the short period at his disposal,\r\nhe attempts to get hold of his man.

=== Chunk 10 ===
"\r\n\r\nI said, "It\'s a cute idea. Imagine going back to the old Mermaid Tavern\r\nand buying Marlowe a drink."\r\n\r\nMallison said, "It\'s a helluva dull story."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know about that," Belcher said. "I did something of the sort\r\na couple of years ago. Got a cent and a half for it, eh Joey? Also a\r\nbonus."\r\n\r\nJoey said, "Say, Dugan, you\'re not cribbing Belcher\'s yarn, are you?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not!" Dugan looked shocked. "Well, the research man had\r\nless than a day. There was some trouble locating the new Shakespeare\'s\r\naddress, and when he did, it was already late at night. Now here\'s the\r\nfirst little surprise. The man lived in the Bronx."\r\n\r\nWe smiled back at him because most of us live in the Bronx. Maybe it\r\nwas a kind of sour smile, but we appreciated the irony. No Bohemian\r\nGreenwich Village, no romantic New England retreat--just unadulterated\r\nBronx.\r\n\r\nDugan said, "He lived in an ordinary apartment house, one like a\r\nmillion others. The research man hadn\'t time enough for formality, so\r\nat three in the morning he learned how to operate the self-service\r\nelevator, went up to the apartment, and broke in to snoop around.\r\n\r\n"He expected, at least, to find something different--to see in the\r\nfurniture and decorations and books an outward sign of the new\r\nShakespeare\'s great talent. But it was just a plain apartment--so plain\r\nthat it needs no description. When I say that there are a million\r\nothers like it, I\'ve described it down to the ultimate detail."\r\n\r\n"What\'d he expect," Joey asked, "genius?"\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t that what we all expect of genius?" Dugan countered. "Certainly\r\nthe research man was disappointed. He sneaked a look at the sleeping\r\ngenius--and saw a dull, undistinguished person thrashing ungracefully\r\nabout on the bed. Nevertheless, he crept about silently, taking motion\r\npictures and--"\r\n\r\n"At three A.M.?"\r\n\r\n"Oh well," Dugan said, "cameras of the Twenty-third Century and all\r\nthat, you know."\r\n\r\n"Could be," Jinx said. "Infra-red photography."\r\n\r\nThe little guy with the pipe bobbed his head as though he\'d invented\r\ninfra-red rays.\r\n\r\n"Then," Dugan went on, "he went to the new Shakespeare\'s desk and\r\ngathered all the manuscripts he could find, because in his time there\r\nwere no surviving manuscripts from his hand. And now--here\'s the final\r\nsurprise.

=== Chunk 11 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t tell me," Jinx said. "He\'d gone to the wrong apartment?"\r\n\r\nBelcher said, "No, that\'s what I used."\r\n\r\n"The surprise is," Dugan said, "that the research man is doing this\r\nwork for his doctorate, and he knows he\'ll never get his degree because\r\neven coming back to the time of the new Shakespeare he can\'t gather\r\nenough material!"\r\n\r\nDugan looked around expectantly, but it\'d laid an egg. There was an\r\nuncomfortable pause while Mallison mumbled bitterly to himself. Jinx\r\nwas very unhappy and tried to say complimentary things. I suppose he\r\nfelt responsible.\r\n\r\nOnly I wasn\'t doing much supposing because I had the most peculiar\r\nsensation.\r\n\r\nI believed Dugan\'s story.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI was thinking of that manuscript that\'d blown out the window and I was\r\ntrying to remember whether I\'d used a paper weight to anchor it down. I\r\nwas thinking of that gadget with buttons and I was realizing how this\r\nmysterious Dugan\'d slipped from one tense to another--which is a thing\r\nall writers are conscious of and which began to have psychological\r\nimport for me.\r\n\r\nBut the most convincing thing of all was how the others were\r\nlooking at Dugan. Belcher was staring keenly from under his black\r\neyebrows--Belcher, who wrote that sort of stuff and who should have\r\nbeen sophisticated. The little guy with the pipe was absolutely\r\nelectrified. I knew it couldn\'t be the story because the story was\r\nlousy even for pulp.\r\n\r\nFinally Dugan said, "That\'s all there is. How d\'you like it?

=== Chunk 12 ===
"\r\n\r\nMallison said, "It stinks!" and probed in his pockets for cigarettes.\r\n\r\n"What was this new Shakespeare\'s name?" Belcher asked slowly.\r\n\r\nDugan said, "I haven\'t decided yet."\r\n\r\nThe little guy took the pipe out of his mouth. "What was the name of\r\nthe story he took?"\r\n\r\nBelcher said, "Yes, what was it?"\r\n\r\nDugan shrugged and smiled. "I haven\'t decided yet. 

=== Chunk 13 ===
It\'s not really\r\nimportant, is it?"\r\n\r\nI said, "Dugan, when was that manuscript taken?"\r\n\r\nI know it was foolish, but I had to ask--and none of the others seemed\r\nto think it peculiar. 

=== Chunk 14 ===
They leaned forward with me and waited for\r\nDugan\'s answer. He looked at me, still smiling, and as I stared at\r\nthose blurry eyes behind the vast thick lenses, I began to shake with\r\nuncertainty. In all that blur there was a strangeness, a something--Oh,\r\nhell!\r\n\r\nSuddenly Belcher began to laugh. He laughed so hard he overturned his\r\nwine bottle and we all had to scurry out of the wet. When it came time\r\nto sit down again, the spell was broken. Anyway, the luncheon was over.\r\n\r\nWhen I got outside, Joey was standing there with Dugan. He was saying,\r\n"I\'m afraid you haven\'t got much of a yarn there."\r\n\r\nDugan said, "I suppose so." Only he didn\'t seem put out. He shook hands\r\nwith us cheerfully, said he hoped he\'d see us again, and turned toward\r\nBroadway.\r\n\r\nWe all waved once, just to be polite, and then lost all interest. We\r\nturned on Joey to see if we could get the price of that lunch out of\r\nhim, and we kidded Jinx about the lousy stories he picked up. Maybe it\r\nwas because some of us felt a little self-conscious. I know I glanced\r\nover my shoulder and felt guilty when I noticed Dugan standing on the\r\ncorner. He was watching us intently and adjusting his glasses with both\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nThen I stopped haggling with Joey and turned around because--well,\r\nbecause it occurred to me that cameras of the Twenty-third Century\r\ncould be so small you couldn\'t see them at that distance. All that\r\nflash and glitter couldn\'t be coming just from Dugan\'s glasses. Yes,\r\nbrother, I turned around while Gray\'s _Elegy_ went thrumming through my\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nIt could be Belcher or Jinx or Mallison, or the little guy with the\r\npipe, but I don\'t think so. I\'ve got a pretty good idea who it is,\r\nbecause something suddenly occurred to me, I turned around to give\r\nDugan a nice full-face and I waved....\r\n\r\nBecause one of those scraps of paper I thought had been blown in my\r\nwindow was marked very peculiarly in red: _Load Only in Total Darkness.\r\nExpires Dec. 18, 2241._\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
