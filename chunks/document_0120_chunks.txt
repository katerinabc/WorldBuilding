]\r\n\r\n\r\nZurg thwirmed, and admitted to himself that he was uneasy. Arching his\r\nthorax, he unrolled his antennae slowly in a lazy gesture he hoped\r\nwould conceal the unseemly nervousness he felt now that the ship had\r\nswung into an orbit around the strange planet. When a commander briefs\r\nhis officers, he must radiate confidence and calm.\r\n\r\n"Companions, an historic moment has arrived," he began pompously, his\r\nantennae moving in the deliberate, stylized movements of the Court\r\nlanguage. "Below us lies the verdant expanse of the third planet, green\r\ngem of the heavens."\r\n\r\nAt this, several of his subordinates turned a rather puzzled yellow\r\naround their head orifices, obviously unable to understand a gesture\r\nof what he was saying. Only the second-in-command seemed unconcerned;\r\nhe knew from long experience that his commander would revert to common\r\nvernacular when he had finished the usual ceremonial preamble.\r\n\r\nZurg did so, noting the relieved hues of his officers as he continued:\r\n"As you all know, our scouts have reconnoitered this world on several\r\noccasions. But now the time has arrived to make an actual landing. In\r\nfact, companions, we are the vanguard of an invasion." Pausing to let\r\nthis register, he was pleased to see that none of the officers seemed\r\nto be suppressing thwirms. If anything, they were calmer than he was.\r\n\r\n"Not a great deal is known about the inhabitants of the planet,\r\nbut the dominant form of life, strangely enough, is mammalian, and\r\npossesses some intelligence. Her Majesty desires conquest without undue\r\ndestruction. As the Queen wills, her servants shall act."\r\n\r\nAll dipped their antennae at this formula, and watched in attentive\r\nhues as the commander went on to explain that due to the high\r\npercentage of oxygen in the atmosphere, special coverings would have\r\nto be worn. They would filter the air before it reached the ventral\r\ntracheae, and leaving the head exposed, would shield all the rest\r\nof the body. A bit clumsy, the commander admitted, but absolutely\r\nessential.\r\n\r\n"Now as to our behavior toward the natives--previous experience with\r\nmammalian life-types shows that they are susceptible to panic and fear\r\nwhen confronted with something totally strange, so we will use tactics\r\nwhich basically are very simple. First, we will land near a native\r\nsettlement. When we march into the area, our alien appearance will stun\r\nthe natives. Our detachment of all-range telepathic sensitives will\r\nnotify us when the state of shock has set in, then our attack support\r\nwill open up with full-scale mental assault, and keep the creatures\r\nparalyzed while we seize the area before a defense can be organized.\r\nThen the Grand Fleet will proceed here at top speed."\r\n\r\n"Remember that in this, as in all operations where the powers of the\r\ncollective mind are used, we must first trigger the enemy\'s reaction by\r\nphysical means, therefore nothing can be done until we _know_ that they\r\nare in the needed state of shock. Now are there any questions?"\r\n\r\nHow strange actually, mused the commander as he returned to his\r\ncubicle, that a race like his own, so gifted at pure mental contact\r\nwith other life-forms, should still use signals and colorations to\r\ncommunicate among themselves. The chafed spot on his left antenna was\r\npaining again after the exercise of the briefing. The report had said\r\nthat these mammalians were believed to converse through some kind\r\nof atmospheric vibrations.... Odd too, that mental warfare, refined\r\nand developed though it was, could still only be used against minds\r\nagitated by a specific physical stimulus. And that physical stimulus\r\nhad to be provided by the invaders appearing on the scene, and if\r\nnecessary performing the Dra, a series of dances and contortions so\r\nrepulsive to most life-forms that all thinking would fade into panic.\r\nHaving once thwirmed himself at a performance of the Dra, he hoped it\r\nwouldn\'t be necessary ... his musings were interrupted as the ship\'s\r\nlights flickered to orange, signalling hands to stations for planetfall.\r\n\r\nLeaving the con of the ship to his second-in-command, he shut himself\r\nin his cubicle and made preparations to be miserably sick, as he always\r\nwas during deceleration. Stroking the chafed spot on his antenna with\r\nthe smooth edge of his left forearm\'s prehensile claw, Zurg raised his\r\nmedicine kit in his secondary tentacles and snapped off the heavy lead\r\nseal with his jagged incisor mandibles. I wonder, he speculated, why\r\nalien races always find us so frightening....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe brilliant orange sun was high in the sky, but only a few filtered\r\nbeams penetrated to the sheltered copse where the slate-colored ship\r\nlay partially concealed by artfully placed vines and underbrush. Drawn\r\nup in three ranks beside the ship, only their heads protruding from\r\nthe loose-fitting coveralls, stood the detail picked to make the entry\r\ninto the native settlement. Zurg led them out through the underbrush\r\nbarrier they had thrown up the night before, and they emerged onto\r\na little-traveled dirt road leading off across the fields toward a\r\ncluster of buildings that marked the edge of town.\r\n\r\nNo creatures appeared as the invading column lumbered along. As they\r\nneared the edge of the settlement, Zurg, his antennae drooping slightly\r\nfrom the unusual heat, turned to remind the others: "Remember, the\r\nmental assault won\'t begin until we are well into the area and shock\r\nreaction is effected, so _stay in formation_ until I order otherwise."\r\n\r\nThere were still no natives in sight on the small side street by which\r\nthey entered town; but as they turned a corner and swung on to the\r\nbroad central thoroughfare, the commander saw that the street was\r\nclogged with natives, a great milling mass of them moving up the\r\nstreet in the same direction as his column, about a hundred yards ahead.\r\n\r\nFor a moment they didn\'t appear to notice the newcomers, but soon a\r\ngrowing number had turned and were gesturing excitedly to each other,\r\npointing at the approaching troop. Watching them anxiously, Zurg saw no\r\nevidence of panic.\r\n\r\nThe column kept moving, and the crowd began parting to let them pass\r\nthrough. Some darted forward as though to get a closer look at the\r\nstrangers. The commander fought off a thwirm as he realized the crowd\r\nwas now all around them, pressing in more closely on every side. The\r\natmosphere itself seemed to vibrate strangely, and looking around, he\r\nsaw that the creatures were opening small head orifices and striking\r\nthe ends of their forward limbs together. Were they communicating--or\r\nwas it something else? It was surely not panic.\r\n\r\nFeeling increasingly dizzy from the heat and vibrations, he glanced\r\nanxiously over his followers, and saw at once that they were more upset\r\nthan he. Colors were flushing their faces in meaningless successions.\r\nOne or two seemed to be staggering. The shock threshold of these beings\r\nhas been horribly underestimated, thought Zurg desperately. Only one\r\nthing left to do--turning again, he signalled the detail to begin the\r\nDra. Perhaps that would overcome this incomprehensible counterattack....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"I tell you Charlie, you\'ve got to discipline that gang! They didn\'t\r\nshow up on time, they didn\'t complete the route, they put on a\r\npublic ritual that wasn\'t scheduled, apparently stealing the entire\r\nshow--stupid crowd yelled themselves hoarse. Then they all reeled off\r\ninto a side street. They must have been drunk to a man--I understand\r\nabout half of them had to be carried! _And_ when I confronted Andy\r\nSharpe, he swore up and down that they weren\'t out of their hotel that\r\nmorning. All sleeping off that spree they had the night before. He\r\nactually had the nerve to say, \'I don\'t know who those boys were that\r\nyou claim were a block behind the end of the parade, but they weren\'t\r\nour boys.\'"\r\n\r\nCharlie Dils, new Commander of the Illinois chapter of the American\r\nLegion, leaned back in his chair car seat and blew a cloud of cigar\r\nsmoke toward the ceiling. "Maybe they were men from Mars," he grinned.\r\nThen, remembering his dignity, he sobered abruptly. "Anyway, one bunch\r\nlooks about the same as another, once they get their masks on--good\r\nLord, it was a hot day for masks--but it certainly made the parade\r\nmore impressive. People are still talking about it. We\'re even getting\r\ncredit for having a flying saucer. Some farmer out at the edge of town\r\nclaims he saw one take off after the parade last night. Says it was\r\ngoing west like a bat out of hell.\r\n\r\n"If we can get that kind of publicity, Frank, I wouldn\'t worry\r\nabout Andy and the boys. I\'ll write him a letter.
