And mass hysteria is by no\r\n       means a product of the present century. But--what if these\r\n       human foibles were deliberately being exploited?_\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE FOURTH INVASION\r\n\r\n                            by Henry Josephs\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Clayton\'s face was impassive as a marble mask when he turned to\r\nyoung Corelli. For a moment, the little group stood there in embarrassed\r\nsilence in the classroom, shifting uneasily from one foot to the other,\r\nfeigning interest in the paperweights upon Clayton\'s desk, or in the\r\nutterly uninspiring scenes on the sidewalk outside the window.\r\n\r\n"You say, Corelli, that you saw three--er, Martian--ships. Can you\r\ndescribe them?"\r\n\r\nCorelli blinked as he felt the weight of his colleagues\' eyes boring\r\ninto him. "I didn\'t say they were _Martian_, sir--only that they seemed\r\nto be unearthly. And they were not the conventional saucer-shaped\r\nthings--they _acted_ like saucers skimming across the water. That\'s what\r\nmade me think they were genuine. And they didn\'t seem to be going fast\r\nenough so that I\'d expect to hear a roar like a jet-plane.\r\n\r\n"It struck me that this might not be the way they fly, naturally, but\r\nthe way they might fly if the pilots were having trouble adjusting the\r\ncontrols to a heavier atmosphere than they were used to."\r\n\r\nClayton tapped the tabletop with his fingers. "What about you, Marty?\r\nDid you see three ships?"\r\n\r\nBig Gene Marty, football star, was the least nervous. "Can\'t be sure\r\nabout _ships_, Doc," he rumbled. "I did see something strange\r\ndisappearing over the horizon. It--I mean they--might have been what\r\nTony says; but whatever it was, there were three of them. But I saw\r\nsomething else, because I was looking in another direction. What I saw\r\nfirst was a couple of funny-looking shapes floating down near the\r\nground. Didn\'t look like parachutists, yet they seemed big enough to be\r\nmen--or at least, small men."\r\n\r\n"Interesting. All right, what about the rest of you? How many saw the\r\nships?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA chorus answered him. "I see," Clayton mused. "You all agree on the\r\nbehavior. And you all think there were three--not four--not two. Three?"\r\n\r\nIt was agreed.\r\n\r\nClayton rustled the pile of newspapers. "The reports in here vary. I\r\nlearn with amazement that you gentlemen seem to have missed completely\r\nthe spurts of flame that issued from the alien ships--flame which is\r\nreported to have set a house on fire. And no one seems to have noticed\r\nthat the invaders, in descending, glided on huge black wings."\r\n\r\nCorelli blushed a fiery crimson.

"Dr. Clayton," he protested, "we aren\'t\r\nmaking these things up for popular consumption. We\'re just telling you\r\nwhat we actually saw--that is--what--what--we--saw looked like to us."\r\n\r\nClayton nodded. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
"Of course. That is all people were doing back in 1938\r\nwhen the Martians landed in New Jersey, at the time Orson Welles\r\npresented a radio version of H. G. Wells\' \'War of the Worlds\'. Or when\r\nthe \'Flying Saucer\' craze first started. Or when Fantafilm put on their\r\nbig publicity stunt for the improved 3-D movie, \'The Outsiders\', and\r\npeople saw the aliens over Broadway and heard them address the populace\r\nin weird, booming tones.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen, I am not pleased to find students of this University\r\nengaging in such unwanted extra-curricular activity as inventing\r\ninterplanetary scares. I don\'t think Washington will be amused, either.

"\r\n\r\nCorelli clicked his heels. "Sir," he stated in dignified tones, "I\r\nresent these implications. I assume they have been directed at me. At no\r\ntime have I talked about this to reporters, or in any way engaged in\r\nwhat you accuse me of. If you want my resignation from this school, you\r\nmay have it."\r\n\r\n"Really? You think that an air of dignified innocence will undo the\r\ndamage done? I am well aware of your experiments with the _y_ wave,\r\ngentlemen--and it was on the _y_ wave that the messages came. You may be\r\ninterested to know that the number of lives lost, the property damage,\r\nthe business losses due to the panic, have not yet been fully\r\ndetermined; but it makes the hysteria following the Fantafilm hoax very\r\nsmall potatoes by comparison.\r\n\r\n"You may withdraw now, gentlemen; this affair will be discussed at\r\ngreater length later, regardless of what the FBI decides. I had hoped\r\nthat the main culprit would try to save unwitting accomplices from a\r\nmeasure of grief. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
That is all."\r\n\r\nThe seven students left Dr. Clayton\'s office in record time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nProfessor Elton rapped the table for silence. "Gentlemen," he began,\r\n"Dr. Clayton and I both extend our sincere apologies." He smiled wanly.\r\n"Of course, that does not exonerate anyone from the charge of\r\ngullibility. But Harvey Gale\'s confession has been fully confirmed by\r\nthe FBI, and you--and this University--have been cleared. The public\r\nknows now that your testimony helped lead to the facts in the case.\r\n\r\n"To me, the most interesting feature of this business is the fact that\r\nGale was able to put over this hoax, despite the fact that the public\r\nhad been taken in three times before. The Orson Welles scare rode on a\r\nwave of war-hysteria; the Flying Saucer craze followed world war; the\r\nFantafilm hoax came when the world was still in dread of sudden\r\nbombings. But the Gale Hoax--what can we call it but what is loosely\r\nknown as the continuing gullibility of human beings?\r\n\r\n"We trust that this demonstration you have just observed will help you\r\nto remember that while seeing may be believing, it\'s wise not to believe\r\nuntil it has been established just what you saw."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn his private office, Dr.

Clayton leaned forward over his desk. Or, to\r\nbe more exact, something that looked like Dr. Clayton leaned over the\r\ndesk. The face was impassive as marble, but, from out a slit in his\r\nchest, a pair of black antennae-like feelers were vibrating into a\r\nframed picture on the wall, from which the picture had been slid aside.\r\n\r\n_"Landing safely effected. Brief panic when several Terrestrials sighted\r\nships; all clear now. Full report, containing details on latest\r\nsuccessful persuasion of Earthlings that Martians or other aliens are\r\nimaginary, will follow."_\r\n\r\nFrom the speaker beneath the desk came sounds of gasps, heavy breathing,\r\nthen shuffling footsteps. Clayton pushed the picture back into place,\r\nthen took off the skin-painted vest he wore, with the flat box on its\r\ninside. He snapped a switch on the side of his desk.\r\n\r\n"There; now they can\'t hear--if any are still hanging around."\r\n\r\nProfessor Elton looked at him bewilderedly. "I don\'t get it. After all\r\nthe risk we went to, to convince the public that there ain\'t no\r\nghosts--as the old saying goes--you arrange to have students hear you\r\ngoing into a \'report to the home planet\' act. And you use a code they\r\nall know. What\'s the point in undoing it?"\r\n\r\nClayton nodded. "It looks somewhat mad, doesn\'t it? Well ... the\r\nPsychology Team was sure of the necessity. You see, more and more humans\r\nremain unconvinced each time one of these hoaxes are exposed. The\r\nunconvinced are sure that something fiendish is going on beneath the\r\nsurface, that the authorities--all kinds from civil to scientific--are\r\nengaged in a vast cover-up. We can\'t prevent this belief; we don\'t know\r\nhow to keep it from spreading. So--the alternative is to direct it."\r\n\r\nElton nodded slowly. "I can see possibilities along that line--but just\r\nwhat direction was this supposed to kind of bring about?"\r\n\r\n"Why, obviously, if large-scale invasion from Mars is imminent--and this\r\nis the belief that we\'re all catering to--then it follows that the\r\ninvasion hasn\'t already taken place. The two of us, and Harvey Gale,\r\nwill disappear shortly in one way or another, and gradually public cries\r\nfor effective planetary defense will mount.\r\n\r\n"You know who will direct the defense."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Future Science Fiction_ No. 30 1956.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.
