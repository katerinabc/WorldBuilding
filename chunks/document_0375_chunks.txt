MacAPP\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATED BY GAUGHAN\r\n\r\n               There\'s nothing wrong with\r\n               dying--it just hasn\'t ever\r\n               had the proper sales pitch!\r\n\r\n\r\nIt all began when the new bookkeeping machine of a large Midwestern\r\ncoffin manufacturer slipped a cog, or blew a transistor, or something.\r\nIt was fantastic that the error--one of two decimal places--should\r\nenjoy a straight run of okays, human and mechanical, clear down the\r\nline; but when the figures clacked out at the last clacking-out\r\nstation, there it was. The figures were now sacred; immutable; and it\r\nis doubtful whether the President of the concern or the Chairman of\r\nthe Board would have dared question them--even if either of those two\r\ngentlemen had been in town.\r\n\r\nAs for the Advertising Manager, the last thing he wanted to do was\r\nquestion them. He carried them (they were the budget for the coming\r\nfiscal year) into his office, staggering a little on the way, and\r\ndropped dazedly into his chair. They showed the budget for his own\r\ndepartment as exactly one hundred times what he\'d been expecting. That\r\nis to say, fifty times what he\'d put in for.\r\n\r\nWhen the initial shock began to wear off, his face assumed an\r\nexpression of intense thought. In about five minutes he leaped from\r\nhis chair, dashed out of the office with a shouted syllable or two for\r\nhis secretary, and got his car out of the parking lot. At home, he\r\ntossed clothes into a travelling bag and barged toward the door,\r\ngiving his wife a quick kiss and an equally quick explanation. He\r\ndidn\'t bother to call the airport. He meant to be on the next plane\r\neast, and no nonsense about it....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith one thing and another, the economy hadn\'t been exactly in\r\noverdrive that year, and predictions for the Christmas season were\r\ngloomy. Early retail figures bore them out. Gift buying dribbled\r\nalong feebly until Thanksgiving, despite brave speeches by the\r\nAdministration. The holiday passed more in self-pity than in\r\nthankfulness among owners of gift-oriented businesses.\r\n\r\nThen, on Friday following Thanksgiving, the coffin ads struck.\r\n\r\nStruck may be too mild a word. People on the streets saw\r\nfeverishly-working crews (at holiday rates!) slapping up posters on\r\nbillboards. The first poster was a dilly. A toothy and toothsome young\r\nwoman leaned over a coffin she\'d been unwrapping. She smiled as if\r\nshe\'d just received overtures of matrimony from an eighty-year-old\r\nbillionaire. There was a Christmas tree in the background, and the\r\ncoffin was appropriately wrapped. So was she. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
She looked as if she had\r\njust gotten out of bed, or were ready to get into it. For amorous\r\nyoung men, and some not so young, the message was plain. The motto,\r\n"_The Gift That Will Last More Than a Lifetime_", seemed hardly to the\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nThose at home were assailed on TV with a variety of bright and clever\r\nskits of the same import. Some of them hinted that, if the young\r\nlady\'s gratitude were really precipitous, and the bedroom too far\r\naway, the coffin might be comfy.\r\n\r\nOf course the more settled elements of the population were not\r\nneglected. For the older married man, there was a blow directly\r\nbetween the eyes: "_Do You Want Your Widow to Be Half-Safe?_" And, for\r\nthe spinster without immediate hopes, "_I Dreamt I Was Caught Dead\r\nWithout My Virginform Casket!_"\r\n\r\nNewspapers, magazines and every other medium added to the assault,\r\nnever letting it cool. It was the most horrendous campaign, for sheer\r\nconcentration, that had ever battered at the public mind. The public\r\nreeled, blinked, shook its head to clear it, gawked, and rushed out to\r\nbuy.\r\n\r\nChristmas was not going to be a failure after all. Department store\r\nmanagers who had, grudgingly and under strong sales pressure, made\r\nspace for a single coffin somewhere at the rear of the store, now\r\nrushed to the telephones like touts with a direct pronouncement from a\r\nhorse. Everyone who possibly could got into the act. Grocery\r\nsupermarkets put in casket departments. The Association of\r\nPharmaceutical Retailers, who felt they had some claim to priority,\r\ntried to get court injunctions to keep caskets out of service\r\nstations, but were unsuccessful because the judges were all out buying\r\ncaskets. Beauty parlors showed real ingenuity in merchandising. Roads\r\nand streets clogged with delivery trucks, rented trailers, and\r\nwhatever else could haul a coffin. The Stock Market went completely\r\nmad. Strikes were declared and settled within hours. Congress was\r\ncalled into session early. The President got authority to ration\r\nlumber and other materials suddenly in starvation-short supply. State\r\nlaws were passed against cremation, under heavy lobby pressure. A new\r\nracket, called boxjacking, blossomed overnight.\r\n\r\nThe Advertising Manager who had put the thing over had been fighting\r\nwith all the formidable weapons of his breed to make his plant\r\nmanagers build up a stockpile. They had, but it went like a toupee in\r\na wind tunnel. Competitive coffin manufacturers were caught napping,\r\nbut by Wednesday after Thanksgiving they, along with the original one,\r\nwere on a twenty-four hour, seven-day basis. Still only a fraction of\r\nthe demand could be met. Jet passenger planes were stripped of their\r\nseats, supplied with Yankee gold, and sent to plunder the world of its\r\ncoffins.\r\n\r\nIt might be supposed that Christmas goods other than caskets would\r\ntake a bad dumping. That was not so. Such was the upsurge of\r\nprosperity, and such was the shortage of coffins, that nearly\r\neverything--with a few exceptions--enjoyed the biggest season on\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\nOn Christmas Eve the frenzy slumped to a crawl, though on Christmas\r\nmorning there were still optimists out prowling the empty stores. The\r\nnation sat down to breathe. Mostly it sat on coffins, because there\r\nwasn\'t space in the living rooms for any other furniture.\r\n\r\nThere was hardly an individual in the United States who didn\'t have,\r\nin case of sudden sharp pains in the chest, several boxes to choose\r\nfrom. As for the rest of the world, it had better not die just now or\r\nit would be literally a case of dust to dust.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf course everyone expected a doozy of a slump after Christmas. But\r\nour Advertising Manager, who by now was of course Sales Manager and\r\nFirst Vice President also, wasn\'t settling for any boom-and-bust. He\'d\r\nbeen a frustrated victim of his choice of industries for so many years\r\nthat now, with his teeth in something, he was going to give it the old\r\nbite. He gave people a short breathing spell to arrange their coffin\r\npayments and move the presents out of the front rooms. Then, late in\r\nJanuary, his new campaign came down like a hundred-megatonner.\r\n\r\nWithin a week, everyone saw quite clearly that his Christmas models\r\nwere now obsolete. The coffin became the new status symbol.\r\n\r\nThe auto industry was of course demolished. Even people who had enough\r\nmoney to buy a new car weren\'t going to trade in the old one and let\r\nthe new one stand out in the rain. The garages were full of coffins.\r\nPetroleum went along with Autos. (Though there were those who\r\nwhispered knowingly that the same people merely moved over into the\r\nnew industry. It was noticeable that the center of it became Detroit.)\r\nA few trucks and buses were still being built, but that was all.\r\n\r\nSome of the new caskets were true works of art. Others--well, there\r\nwas variety. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Compact models appeared, in which the occupant\'s feet\r\nwere to be doubled up alongside his ears. One manufacturer pushed a\r\ncircular model, claiming that by all the laws of nature the foetal\r\nposition was the only right one. At the other extreme were virtual\r\nhouses, ornate and lavishly equipped. Possibly the largest of all was\r\nthe "_Togetherness_" model, triangular, with graduated recesses for\r\nFather, Mother, eight children (plus two playmates), and, in the far\r\ncorner beyond the baby, the cat.\r\n\r\nThe slump was over. Still, economists swore that the new boom couldn\'t\r\nlast either. They reckoned without the Advertising Manager, whose eyes\r\ngleamed brighter all the time. People already had coffins, which they\r\npolished and kept on display, sometimes in the new "Coffin-ports"\r\nbeing added to houses. The Advertising Manager\'s reasoning was direct\r\nand to the point. He must get people to use the coffins; and now he\r\nhad all the money to work with that he could use.\r\n\r\nThe new note was woven in so gradually that it is not easy to put a\r\nfinger on any one ad and say, "It began here." One of the first was\r\nsurely the widely-printed one showing a tattooed, smiling young man\r\nwith his chin thrust out manfully, lying in a coffin. He was\r\nrugged-looking and likable (not too rugged for the spindly-limbed to\r\nidentify with) and he oozed, even though obviously dead, virility at\r\nevery pore. He was probably the finest-looking corpse since Richard\r\nthe Lion-Hearted.\r\n\r\nNeither must one overlook the singing commercials. Possibly the\r\ncatchiest of these, a really cute little thing, was achieved by\r\njazzing up the Funeral March.\r\n\r\nIt started gradually, and it was all so un-violent that few saw it as\r\nsuicide. Teen-agers began having "Popping-off parties". Some of their\r\nelders protested a little, but adults were taking it up too. The\r\ntired, the unappreciated, the ill and the heavy-laden lay down in\r\ngrowing numbers and expired. A black market in poisons operated for a\r\nlittle while, but soon pinched out. Such was the pressure of\r\npersuasion that few needed artificial aids. The boxes _were_ very\r\ncomfortable. People just closed their eyes and exited smiling.\r\n\r\nThe Beatniks, who had their own models of coffin--mouldy, scroungy,\r\nand without lids, since the Beatniks insisted on being seen--placed\r\ntheir boxes on the Grant Avenue in San Francisco. They died with\r\nhighly intellectual expressions, and eventually were washed by the\r\ngentle rain.\r\n\r\nOf course there were voices shouting calamity. When aren\'t there? But\r\nin the long run, and not a very long one at that, they availed naught.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt isn\'t hard to imagine the reactions of the rest of the world. So\r\nlet us imagine a few.\r\n\r\nThe Communist Block immediately gave its Stamp of Disapproval,\r\ndenouncing the movement as a filthy Capitalist Imperialist Pig plot.\r\nRed China, which had been squabbling with Russia for some time about a\r\nmatter of method, screamed for immediate war. Russia exposed this as\r\npatent stupidity, saying that if the Capitalists wanted to die,\r\nwarring upon them would only help them. China surreptitiously tried\r\nout the thing as an answer to excess population, and found it good. It\r\nalso appealed to the well-known melancholy facet of Russian nature.\r\nBesides, after pondering for several days, the Red Bloc decided it\r\ncould not afford to fall behind in anything, so it started its own\r\nprogram, explaining with much logic how it differed.\r\n\r\nAn elderly British philosopher endorsed the movement, on the grounds\r\nthat a temporary setback in Evolution was preferable to facing up to\r\nanything.\r\n\r\nThe Free Bloc, the Red Bloc, the Neutral Bloc and such scraps as had\r\nbeen too obtuse to find themselves a Bloc were drawn into the\r\nwhirlpool in an amazingly short time, if in a variety of ways. In less\r\nthan two years the world was rid of most of what had been bedeviling\r\nit.\r\n\r\nOddly enough, the country where the movement began was the last to\r\nsuccumb completely. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Or perhaps it is not so odd. Coffin-maker to the\r\nworld, the American casket industry had by now almost completely\r\nautomated box-making and gravedigging, with some interesting assembly\r\nlines and packaging arrangements; there still remained the jobs of\r\nmanagement and distribution. The President of General Mortuary, an\r\nebullient fellow affectionately called Sarcophagus Sam, put it well.\r\n"As long as I have a single prospective customer, and a single\r\nStockholder," he said, mangling a stogie and beetling his brows at the\r\none reporter who\'d showed up for the press conference, "I\'ll try to\r\nput him in a coffin so I can pay him a dividend."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFinally, though, a man who thought he must be the last living human,\r\nwandered contentedly about the city of Denver looking for the coffin\r\nhe liked best. He settled at last upon a rich mahogany number with\r\nplatinum trimmings, an Automatic Self-Adjusting Cadaver-contour\r\nInnerspring Wearever-Plastic-Covered Mattress with a built in bar. He\r\nclimbed in, drew himself a generous slug of fine Scotch, giggled as\r\nthe mattress prodded him exploringly, closed his eyes and sighed in\r\nsolid comfort. Soft music played as the lid closed itself.\r\n\r\nFrom a building nearby a turkey-buzzard swooped down, cawing in\r\nraucous anger because it had let its attention wander for a moment. It\r\nwas too late. It clawed screaming at the solid cover, hissed in\r\nfrustration and finally gave up. It flapped into the air again, still\r\ngrumbling. It was tired of living on dead small rodents and coyotes.\r\nIt thought it would take a swing over to Los Angeles, where the\r\npickings were pretty good.\r\n\r\nAs it moved westward over parched hills, it espied two black dots a\r\nfew miles to its left. It circled over for a closer look, then grunted\r\nand went on its way. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
It had seen _them_ before. The old prospector and\r\nhis burro had been in the mountains for so long the buzzard had\r\nconcluded they didn\'t know _how_ to die.\r\n\r\nThe prospector, whose name was Adams, trudged behind his burro toward\r\nthe buildings that shimmered in the heat, humming to himself now and\r\nthen or addressing some remark to the beast. When he reached the\r\noutskirts of Denver he realized something was amiss. He stood and\r\ngazed at the quiet scene. Nothing moved except some skinny packrats\r\nand a few sparrows foraging for grain among the unburied coffins.\r\n\r\n"Tarnation!" he said to the burro. "Martians?"\r\n\r\nA half-buried piece of newspaper fluttered in the breeze. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
He walked\r\nforward slowly and picked it up. It told him enough so that he\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\n"They\'re gone, Evie," he said to the burro, "all gone." He put his arm\r\naffectionately around her neck. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
"I reckon it\'s up to me and you agin.\r\nWe got to start all over." He stood back and gazed at her with mild\r\nreproach. "I shore hope they don\'t favor your side of the house so\r\nmuch this time."--C.C.
