=== Chunk 2 ===
]\r\n\r\n\r\nCommander Losure gave orders to his navigator to bring the ship in on\r\nthe satellite out of sight of the prying telescopes which no doubt\r\nexisted on such an invitingly green planet. He was a cautious man and\r\ndidn\'t intend to lose any more crew members if he could help it. He\r\ncould tell by the unusually poor handling of the ship that the crew was\r\nstill demoralized from the brush with the high I.Q. slugs on that last\r\nplanet which they had approached so directly. They\'d lost three men in\r\nthat scrap, one of them a highly-valued anthropologist. There were only\r\ntwo more of those left in the freeze locker. Too bad it couldn\'t have\r\nbeen a radio operator, there were plenty of those on ice.\r\n\r\nThe Commander\'s thoughts were interrupted by his second officer who\r\nentered without the customary military burp.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll forgive you this time, Montresig," said the Commander, "but we\r\ncan\'t relax regulations now, can we. Anything new to report on this\r\nplanet?"\r\n\r\n"No, Your Loftiness," said Montresig, after giving a belated burp,\r\n"there\'s nothing to add to what we already know, but then we\'ve just\r\ncome to rest on this clinker of a moon. I don\'t imagine, however, that\r\nwe\'ve located our long lost ancestors or our mythical home planet.\r\nThere doesn\'t seem to be a race in this galaxy that walks upright on\r\ntwo good legs with two arms, two eyes, nose, mouth and other standard\r\nequipment."\r\n\r\n"Could be we\'ll find one this time," said the Commander. "We know it\'s\r\nan oxygen planet, and that there are intelligent beings there, judging\r\nfrom the cities we can see and their use of radio."\r\n\r\n"Maybe," grumbled Montresig, "but they won\'t be men. If they\'re not\r\nslugs they\'ll be talking fish or intellectual spiders, or something\r\nequally repulsive. And I can tell you one thing, whatever we find, if\r\nit has brains it will want to fight."\r\n\r\n"Now Montresig, don\'t be bitter. We\'ve only examined a couple hundred\r\nplanets. There are many more and you know we\'ll have to take a look at\r\nas many as we can. I tell you, however, we won\'t take any more chances.\r\nUnless we find out they\'re pretty much like us we won\'t go near the\r\ndamn planet."\r\n\r\n"How do you propose to find that out, Your Loftiness? We can\'t see\r\nanything that small by telescope, we haven\'t learned much so far\r\nby listening to them, and it\'s pretty dangerous business using the\r\ndredge...."\r\n\r\n"Ah, my dear Montresig, the crux of the matter is that we _can_ tell\r\nabout them, I believe, from listening to them. Judging from the reports\r\nI got from Communications, this is the talkingest planet in the galaxy.\r\nThey are utilizing the entire radio spectrum we know and, I suspect,\r\nsome portions of it we don\'t know. All they do is talk. There must be\r\nmillions of individuals on that planet jabbering in a dozen different\r\nlanguages. Our language technicians have decoded two of the major\r\ntongues already and have fed the information to the main computer. All\r\nradio signals in those languages are now being fed directly to the\r\ncomputer and the information is being classified and cross-referenced."\r\n\r\nMontresig\'s furry countenance brightened. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
"Then we won\'t have to send\r\ndown the dredge?"\r\n\r\n"I hope not, Montresig, I do not like to bring strange life forms\r\naboard the ship. Remember planet 187 in the Dghorzid system?"\r\n\r\nMontresig shuddered. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
"I\'ll never forget. When that monster materialized\r\nin the hold I snapped on the stasis field and it had no effect. I\r\ntried every last trick in the bag including seven kinds of poison gas.\r\nLuckily the dredge operator was able to catch him and throw him back\r\nwhere he came from but the hold was a shambles and two men had to have\r\nextensive repair work."\r\n\r\n"Well," said the Commander, "I don\'t like the dredge at all, but I\r\nsuppose it\'s better than landing and having to do battle with slugs. I\r\nswear I was certain there was no intelligent life on that planet. By\r\nthe way, I\'m having an anthropologist thawed out now, that leaves only\r\none more in the freeze locker and we can\'t operate without one. Take\r\ncare nothing happens to him, Montresig."\r\n\r\nCommander Losure made the sign of dismissal and Montresig burped\r\ngracefully and withdrew. The Commander signaled communications. After\r\na considerable delay a burp sounded from the speaker on the wall and a\r\nvoice announced: "Troniff here. May I serve Your Loftiness?"\r\n\r\n"Troniff," said the Commander, "the delay is inexcusable. Does the\r\ncomputer have its belly full yet?"\r\n\r\n"Your Loftiness, the reference tapes are full, but the machine is\r\nunable to present a full picture of the dominant life form. It\r\nappears, however, that they are much like us in general body shape.\r\nUnfortunately, we can get no reference point from which to judge their\r\nsize. They are exceedingly ferocious and blood thirsty, and apparently\r\nwar among themselves continuously."\r\n\r\n"I\'m tempted to leave now," said the Commander. "I\'ll have to use the\r\ndredge, I suppose.... Are you sure it won\'t do some good to listen to\r\ntheir communications awhile longer?"\r\n\r\nThe speaker was silent for a moment, then Troniff spoke.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like to mention this, Your Loftiness, but my engineers have\r\nfound several unidentified types of emission besides those carrying\r\nspeech frequencies. They think that one particular type characterized\r\nby an extremely broad frequency range just might be transmission of\r\nvisual images...."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe it," said the Commander. "We\'ve been trying to do that\r\nfor hundreds of years without success and so far as we\'ve been we\'ve\r\nnever found another race in the galaxy as far advanced technologically\r\nas ours. These people don\'t even have space flight."\r\n\r\n"They have artificial satellites up," said Troniff, "We\'re monitoring\r\nsignals from one, and from what I gather they\'re apt to have something\r\nup on this moon before long."\r\n\r\n"Any chance of finding out how they transmit visual images--if they\r\nreally do?"\r\n\r\n"Not a chance," said Troniff. "My engineers can\'t even conceive of a\r\ndevice that could convert these signals into a picture."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all, Troniff. Notify Montresig that he\'s to meet me immediately\r\nin the dredge room with the anthropologist and a dredge operator."\r\n\r\nThe commander sighed. What irony that the only truly peaceful race in\r\nthe galaxy should be the only one to discover interstellar flight. For\r\nfour thousand years the Kaar had had their ships and had colonized\r\nhundreds of planets until they had lost track of which one they started\r\nfrom. In all that time they had avoided planets with intelligent life,\r\nhad never found any other ships in space. Now, thought the Commander,\r\nwe have to go looking for trouble just to satisfy our curiosity as to\r\nwhere we started from.\r\n\r\nMontresig introduced the newly-thawed anthropologist to him on the\r\ndredge room balcony and Commander Losure briefed him on the importance\r\nof his job.\r\n\r\n"We don\'t believe this race has any connection with ours," said the\r\nCommander. "It\'s too savage. And yet, we haven\'t found another race as\r\nfar advanced in science, nor one that appears to be so similar to ours.\r\nOur problem is to find out a little more about them, their physical\r\nsize, whether it\'s safe to contact them, which I personally doubt."\r\n\r\n"Is it your intention to bring back one of these intelligent beings\r\nwith the dredge?" asked the anthropologist.\r\n\r\n"You know better than that, or maybe you don\'t," said the Commander.\r\n"Anyway, you should know that it is against our code of ethics to cause\r\nharm to any intelligent being. That dredge is set to reject any living\r\ncreature capable of a high order of thought and that control is sealed\r\nagainst our use. The idea is to bring back artifacts that might tell us\r\nsomething about the people of the planet... maybe they have a written\r\nlanguage and have something that approximates our scrolls, maybe they\r\nhave drawings. I\'d especially like to snag one of the visual image\r\nreceptors our communications engineers think they have."\r\n\r\n"The dredge operator is ready," said Montresig. "The computer controls\r\nhave been switched to this balcony and the stasis beam has been\r\nchecked."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCommander Losure looked up at the dredge operator in his glassed-in\r\nbooth high on the opposite wall of the hold. He gave a quick hand\r\nsignal and transferred his attention to the floor of the vast hold\r\nbelow him. A shimmering mistiness began to form in the center of the\r\nfloor. Commander Losure could feel the tension of his companions as\r\nthey waited. It was a blind grab; the dredge operator had no way of\r\nknowing what would be scooped up at the end of his force beam. Slowly\r\nthe mistiness grew more dense, darkening to an impenetrable cloud, and\r\nthen vanished with an audible snap leaving a strange alien mechanism\r\non the floor of the hold. It resembled a huge cylinder resting on\r\ntractor-like treads.\r\n\r\nFrom the balcony the men scurrying across the floor seemed dwarfed by\r\nthe object. Unheeding of any danger they swarmed over it, measuring,\r\ntesting, amassing information to be fed to the computer.\r\n\r\n"Holy Ghosts of My Departed Ancestors," gasped Montresig, "what is it?"\r\n\r\n"You know as much about it as I do, my dear fellow," the Commander\r\nsaid. "As soon as the engineers get through poking at it we\'ll find out\r\nwhat the computer thinks it is."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll bet it\'s a weapon of some sort," said Montresig. "They\'re almost\r\nalways fighting down there according to the data we have and there\'s\r\nfrequent mention of a device called a hydrogen bomb. If it\'s what I\r\nthink it is I have no desire to visit them in person."\r\n\r\nA figure detached itself from the group of men surrounding the huge\r\ncontrivance and came hurrying to the elevator entrance beneath the\r\nbalcony. In a moment he appeared on the balcony, burped perfunctorily,\r\nand handed Commander Losure several sheets of script. The Commander\r\nread them into a microphone grill which was part of the remote panel\r\nfeeding into the main computer. He waited until a red light glowed,\r\nindicating that the material had been integrated. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
He pressed a stud\r\nand spoke into the microphone again. "Classify," he said.\r\n\r\n"Information in storage banks reveals object to be a gun," said the\r\nloudspeaker. "Gun: an instrument variously known as revolver, heater,\r\nrod, betsy, automatic, typewriter, gat, which refer to. Carried by\r\ngunmen, cowboys, mobsters, killers, cons, doughboys, cops, G-men,\r\nmarines, gangsters and kids, which refer to. Weapon fires projectile\r\nknown as bullet, lead, shell, slug, which refer to. Solid projectile\r\npierces body of individual causing serious injury and death. It is used\r\nwith that intention. No information on size of instrument previous to\r\ncaptured speciman which is nearly fourteen zeng ... about five and a\r\nquarter man-lengths ... long. Sample excerpt demonstrating use: \'Blinky\r\nsnapped the gun from his holster and fired from the hip. (sound of\r\nexplosion) The big cowpoke grabbed at his chest and blood spurted\r\nbetween his fingers. With a look of surprise on his face he slumped to\r\nthe barroom floor.\'"\r\n\r\n"What do you make of that?" asked the Commander.\r\n\r\n"I\'d have been surprised, too," said Montresig.\r\n\r\n"They\'re bloodthirsty giants," said the anthropologist. "If that\'s a\r\npocket weapon they\'d be so big you couldn\'t get one into this hold.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe it," said the Commander. "I think there\'s something\r\nwrong somewhere. Possibly guns come in various sizes. This could be a\r\nstationary weapon, perhaps, to blow buildings apart instead of people,\r\nthough I can\'t figure out why anybody would want to. I\'m going to send\r\nthe dredge back once more to make sure we aren\'t being misled.

=== Chunk 6 ===
"\r\n\r\n"I think you\'re wrong," said Montresig. "All evidence does point to\r\na race of giants, evil creatures at best, even if maybe they do have\r\ntwo eyes, a nose and a mouth like us. Not that I don\'t think it\'s a\r\ngood idea to send the dredge back," he added hastily at the sight of\r\nCommander Losure\'s glowering countenance.\r\n\r\nThe Commander signaled to the dredge operator again and they waited\r\nwhile he returned the gun to wherever he got it and fished for\r\nsomething else from the surface of the green planet.\r\n\r\nThe anthropologist cleared his throat. "You can\'t deny that the\r\ntelescope shows us the most gigantic cities to be found anywhere in the\r\ngalaxy."\r\n\r\n"That doesn\'t necessarily mean that the inhabitants are physically\r\nlarge, only that there may be a lot of them," said the Commander.\r\n\r\n"Or both."\r\n\r\nTheir attention turned to the floor of the hold as the opaque cloud\r\nrapidly grew darker and vanished again with a snap.\r\n\r\nMontresig\'s reaction was the same as before.\r\n\r\n"Great Shades of My Holy Ancestors," he said. "What is it?"\r\n\r\n"It is assuredly an animal," said the Commander, "not unlike some we\r\nhave on our own planet. I\'ll have the biologists and medics examine\r\nit." He turned to the anthropologist. "You go, too, Alfvis."\r\n\r\nThe animal, which had appeared stunned when it first appeared, now\r\nbegan to turn around, making clicking noises on the floor. As the men\r\napproached it from all directions it looked about nervously, opened\r\nits mouth to show some glistening teeth and proceeded to make a long,\r\nharsh noise. Alfvis made the mistake of approaching too closely to\r\nthe beast which wheeled and kicked him head over heels some distance\r\naway. Montresig touched a red button on the railing and stasis beams\r\nconverged on the animal freezing it instantly. It toppled over and lay\r\nstiffly on the floor of the hold. Alfvis dragged himself to his feet\r\nand shouted up to the balcony. "Ask the computer about animals with\r\nlong ears."\r\n\r\nThe Commander spoke into the microphone again. "Four-legged animal,\r\nlong ears. Classify."\r\n\r\n"Rabbit," said the computer. "An animal variously known as bunny, hare,\r\nconey, peter, uncle wiggly. Strong rear legs. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Progresses over ground\r\nerratically. Consumes vegetation. Multiplies with great rapidity. Lays\r\negg at Easter Time. It is generally considered timid and is hunted for\r\nfood. Sample excerpt demonstrating relationship: \'Lon climbed over the\r\nstone wall and continued across the woodlot towards his cabin, the\r\ncarcasses of three rabbits slung over his shoulder ... there would be\r\nrabbit stew tonight.\'"\r\n\r\n"Holy Gods in Their Celestial Quarters," said Montresig. "Did you\r\nhear that? 

=== Chunk 8 ===
Is there any question in your mind now about the size and\r\nferocity of these people?"\r\n\r\n"Considerable," said the Commander. "That computer has made mistakes\r\nbefore, witness that last planet. Those were supposed to be garden\r\nsnails, those slugs that gave us such a walloping. I don\'t think we get\r\nthe right information through to it."\r\n\r\n"But Your Loftiness," wailed Montresig, "everything adds up, you can\r\nsee for yourself ... their giant cities, their warring on each other,\r\nthe information the computer gave us ... it isn\'t safe to land on that\r\nplanet."\r\n\r\n"No, I suppose not," sighed the Commander. "But do you realize the\r\nimplications? Here we have a highly advanced race just ready to take\r\noff into space ... and according to our information they are savage\r\nwar-making giants. If I bring that news back our Supreme Goodness is\r\napt to issue orders to evacuate several hundred planets and move to\r\nsome other galaxy--Let\'s try the dredge once more."\r\n\r\nCommander signaled the dredge operator and waited a reasonable length\r\nof time before he was informed that something was wrong with it and\r\nthat it would be some time before repairs could be made.\r\n\r\n"I give up," said Commander Losure. "I have orders not to land on a\r\nquestionable planet and I\'ve learned my lesson. Either that computer\r\nhas a few loose connections or those people are broadcasting pure\r\nnonsense. I just don\'t believe in giants, much less in scientific\r\nones. Get ready to leave, Montresig, and see that you make an accurate\r\nwritten report of this whole situation."\r\n\r\n"What do we do with the animal, Your Loftiness?"\r\n\r\n"The dredge is busted, so what do you think we can do with it? Heave it\r\nout the airlock. It can stay here on the moon until the first explorers\r\ncome up from the planet, which won\'t be long, and they can have rabbit\r\nstew."\r\n\r\nThe great ship lifted from the dark moonscape, leaving behind the\r\nfrozen form of the first earth being to have crossed space, a surprise\r\nfor the crew of the first manned moon rocket, if not the makings of\r\nrabbit stew.\r\n\r\nSomewhere, a million miles beyond the sun, the ship accelerated\r\nrapidly. The Commander looked up from his desk as Montresig entered\r\nsmartly with a precision burp.\r\n\r\n"Alfvis is back in the freeze locker and repairs are going forward on\r\nthe dredge, but it\'ll be a long job."\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t matter," said the Commander. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
"We\'re going home. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
I\'m\r\ncommitted to bringing back a report on this planet now, but I don\'t\r\nlike it and will advise further study of it by other expeditions before\r\nany desperate measures are taken such as evacuating the galaxy."\r\n\r\n"It\'s funny about that rabbit," said Montresig. "I noticed as we shoved\r\nit out the lock that it had semi-circles of some hard metal, probably\r\niron, nailed to its feet."\r\n\r\n"That is peculiar," said the Commander. "Almost like the shoes we\r\nattach to the feests\' hooves before the children ride them. Just for\r\nthe fun of it, Montresig, why don\'t you give that information to the\r\ncomputer and see what it says?"\r\n\r\n"Can\'t," said Montresig. "I wiped the memory tanks clean. I don\'t think\r\nit means much, anyway; a rabbit\'s a rabbit, shoes or no shoes."\r\n\r\nThe Commander nodded and Montresig burped and withdrew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s Rabbits Have Long Ears, by Lawrence F.
