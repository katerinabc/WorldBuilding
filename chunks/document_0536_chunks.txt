Ronal had told her\r\nat the outset of the cruise that although Krist\'s friend Logan was\r\nyoung for a space pilot, he was a good one, and had trained in the old\r\nfuel-propelled ships that men had first flown Space in before the new\r\nwarp-drive had been perfected. But Logan was sweating visibly.\r\n\r\nThe blue planet loomed up, and Krist, who owned the trim Space-yacht\r\nand had suggested the cruise, jumped noticeably when the first shrill\r\nwhistle of atmospheric resistance pierced the tense quiet of the\r\nwell-appointed control-room.\r\n\r\nThey were half-falling, half-gliding downward, and despite Logan\'s\r\nattempts to check their descent with the clogged free-drive maneuvering\r\njets, their downward speed seemed to increase each second.\r\n\r\n"My fault," Ronal muttered so only Marla could hear. "Had we stayed on\r\nthe warp we charted and not followed my suggestion to go adventuring on\r\nfree-drive in some system none of us have ever heard of, we wouldn\'t be\r\nin this mess."\r\n\r\n"Not your fault, dear," Marla said to her husband. "Even Logan couldn\'t\r\nhave known the free-drive would fail and leave us too far from our\r\nwarp-point to make it back, and--"\r\n\r\nThe stricken craft lurched again, and the polished nose began an almost\r\nimperceptible up-swing. The shrill scream of the rarefied atmosphere\r\nbegan descending the scale like a gigantic siren running down.\r\n\r\n"Flat on the deck!" Krist yelled.\r\n\r\nLush, green forests stretched but scant miles below. The sound of a\r\nheavy, rich atmosphere now racing past their gleaming hull dropped to a\r\nlow, moaning note and then the sound of it was gone.\r\n\r\nThe nose came up.\r\n\r\nThere was a wrenching jar and the nerve-shattering cry of tearing,\r\nscorched metal. The control-room rocked crazily, then was suddenly\r\nstill, cocked at a nightmare angle, as a shuddering impact brought the\r\nwildly slewing craft to a punishing halt.\r\n\r\nAnd for the four of them, there was sudden oblivion....\r\n\r\n"Marla was as lucky as the rest of us," Ronal said. "Just the wind\r\nknocked out of her. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
She\'s coming around." The girl\'s silver-flecked\r\neyes were already open and for a moment there was forgetfulness in\r\nthem. "We splattered a little," Ronal told her. "You move all right?

=== Chunk 4 ===
"\r\n\r\nShe was shaken, but unhurt. He helped her to a standing position on the\r\ncanted deck, and saw that Krist and Logan were already taking a rapid\r\ninventory of the yacht\'s available tools.\r\n\r\n"Got to look around outside," Logan was saying, shaking his bruised\r\nhead a little, "before I can tell you how bad we are. But I think\r\nKrist and I can get her back into one piece."\r\n\r\n"Can if we can go out," the tall, athletic-looking owner of the\r\npleasure craft said. "We\'ll need the suits.

=== Chunk 5 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Maybe not," Ronal said. "There was plenty of atmosphere wailing away--"\r\n\r\n"Five credits gets you 20 it\'s all pure poison," Logan retorted. He\r\nwas standing at one of the metalo-glass ports, surveying the colorful\r\nterrain speculatively. They joined him.\r\n\r\nThe ship had hit in an oblong clearing, perhaps five miles in length\r\nand half that in width. Surrounding the open, grassy spot were the\r\ndepths of an untamed, riotously colored jungle.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll give it a try in a suit," Logan said. "The sooner we patch up and\r\nget out of here the better. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
No telling what\'s in that." He gestured\r\ntoward the clearing\'s mile-distant edge.\r\n\r\nRonal helped him into the bundlesome plasti-seal space-suit, then\r\nwatched tensely with the others as the starboard airlock hissed, and\r\nLogan stepped onto the thickly-carpeted clearing floor.\r\n\r\n"He\'s a cool kid," Ronal said. "For all we know, he\'s just--"\r\n\r\n"He\'s a cracker-jack mechanic," Krist interrupted. "If we\'ve got a\r\ncouple of straight rivets left, he\'ll get us out of here. I\'m just glad\r\nthat he picked out this planet to come in on instead of the first or\r\nsecond out from this system\'s sun. It\'s plenty hot even here." They\r\nwere all perspiring freely; the atmosphere conditioner had ceased\r\noperating from the shock of landing.\r\n\r\nLogan\'s voice cracked from the still-functioning communications panel.\r\n\r\n"Not too bad. Forehull plates got a little bashed in--couple of rips in\r\nthe speed-skin. Take us maybe four, five days to get her Space-worthy\r\nagain. Can unclog the free-drive jets in a day easy. But the guy who\r\nthought of leaving modern yachts equipped with free-drive units oughtta\r\nbe hung from a comet tail."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey could see Logan near the nose of the ship. His hands were working\r\nat his helmet.\r\n\r\n"Take it easy!" Krist called. They could hear a soft hiss in the\r\nintercom.\r\n\r\n"Letting some of this stuff in, a cubic millimeter at a time, grandma!\r\nIf I can breathe it, I\'ll let you know. If I can\'t--Anyway, if we can\r\nwork without the suits, it\'ll get us out of here that much sooner.\r\nDon\'t know about you kids, but I didn\'t even bring a sling-shot\r\nalong...."\r\n\r\nKrist traded looks with Ronal. There wasn\'t so much as a hand-gun in\r\nthe whole ship. Neither said what was in his mind but Ronal drew Marla\r\na little closer and broke the silence.\r\n\r\n"You\'d think they\'d equip even pleasure craft with a few of these\r\nscientific gadgets you hear about, instead of taking up room with a\r\nlot of old-fashioned fuel tanks and jets that nobody needs. With an\r\natmosphere or gravity tester things like this would be a lot less\r\nrisky. Got to admire Logan\'s nerve."\r\n\r\n"He\'s got his suit off!"\r\n\r\nIt was true. Logan was walking slowly, experimentally about, eyeing\r\nthe surrounding terrain to estimate their situation, unhampered by the\r\nsuit. He moved slowly, but not laboredly.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s get some tools out there!" Ronal said. "The three of us can--"\r\n\r\n"There\'s only the emergency kit. Tools enough for two, working\r\nsimultaneously. You better stick with Marla, Ronal, and both of you\r\ncan keep a weather-eye out for--anything--while we\'re putting this egg\r\ntogether again."\r\n\r\n"How about trying to contact some Stellar Patrol outpost? They--"\r\n\r\n"No good. We\'re way off our warp. Even if we had the power, it\'d take\r\nour beam, like our ship if it had enough free-drive fuel--about eighty\r\nthousand years to reach the nearest one. Remember, kid, we had warped\r\nsome fifty thousand light-years out before you talked Logan into\r\nleaving the warp to fool around in free Space for awhile. Until we can\r\njet our way back to warp-point, we can forget about communication."\r\n\r\nRonal understood too clearly what Krist was talking about. Travel\r\nin "free" Space, the ordinary three-dimensional kind, was measured\r\nin miles; warp-travel was measured in parsecs. "Free" speed, with\r\nold-fashioned fuel-eating jets which were supposed to be carried as\r\nemergency power units only, was forty thousand miles a second at\r\nbest--warp-speed, depending on the dimension you used, had a top of\r\nbetter than a thousand light-years a minute. Leaving your warp to poke\r\naround in ordinary three-dimensional Space on jets was like leaving\r\nyour surface-car parked on a speedway to hike up a side-road on foot.\r\nYou had to get back to the speedway to get home. And if you broke a\r\nleg--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKrist was already outside, lugging tool-carriers to a spot Logan had\r\nselected to begin. Ronal turned to his wife.\r\n\r\n"Well, we can\'t keep a weather-eye out for bug-eyed monsters in here,"\r\nhe said. "Might as well go brave the Great Unknown ourselves. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
C\'mon!"\r\n\r\nThe heavy grass was wet and soft beneath their feet, and had a\r\ndistinctive aroma of its own. Ronal thought to himself as they walked\r\nthat perhaps the red, desert covered fourth planet would have been a\r\nbetter bet after all--at least cooler.\r\n\r\n"We shouldn\'t get too far from the ship," Marla said.\r\n\r\n"We won\'t. But I just want to look around--want a closer look at the\r\njungle from the edge of the clearing. Always wanted to be able to tell\r\npeople I\'d been exploring on some strange, exotic planet somewhere--"\r\n\r\n"It\'s strange enough. But quiet up to now, anyway. Maybe all that--"\r\n\r\nThey had reached the clearing\'s edge.\r\n\r\nAnd saw the Hairy One for the first time.\r\n\r\nMarla stopped in mid-sentence, and they stood transfixed.\r\n\r\nThe Hairy One regarded them evenly with small, narrowly-spaced black\r\neyes. He remained as immobile as the two from the ship.\r\n\r\n"Like a man, but smaller," Marla whispered tautly.\r\n\r\n"But covered with hair! And on all fours," Ronal said. Marla started to\r\nspeak again, but he silenced her with a nervous gesture. The ape-like\r\ncreature cocked its head, as though listening. A light breeze made\r\nripples in the thick hair on his narrow, sloping back, but for long\r\nmoments he did not stir, nor did Marla or Ronal advance toward him.\r\n\r\nThe Hairy One fixed his gaze on Marla, then shifted it to her husband.\r\nThen, as though at a signal, he turned abruptly and shambled off into\r\nthe dense undergrowth at a rapid pace without so much as a backward\r\nglance.\r\n\r\n"Better be on our way back," Ronal said. "If he\'s displeased with us,\r\nhe\'ll have his whole tribe on our necks."\r\n\r\nTo run a mile\'s distance had never been difficult for either the man or\r\nwoman before, but on this lush planet with its heavy, sweet atmosphere\r\nand slightly greater gravity than that of their own home sphere, it\r\nseemed to both that the distance between them and the ship would never\r\nbe covered. Ronal glanced over his shoulder twice as they ran, but\r\nthere were no signs of activity at the jungle\'s edge. But the heavy\r\nfoliage would make perfect camouflage for an entire army....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKrist dogged the airlock shut. "The best bet," he said, "is to barge\r\nright in and let them all see us. If we can let them know, or get them\r\nto understand, that we\'re weaponless and harmless, they won\'t attack."\r\n\r\n"That would only work if their thinking is based on our system of\r\nlogic," Logan said. "We don\'t know that it is. It could easily be\r\nsuicide to step one inch inside that seething tangle."\r\n\r\n"But you\'ve both missed the big point," Ronal said. "I doubt very much\r\nif he, or they can \'think\' at all as we know thought. He is no more\r\nthan a beast--a jungle beast, and would behave according to what I\'ve\r\nread is the first law of the wild--exterminate the intruder to protect\r\nyourself. And I think if he and his kind did attack, it would be under\r\ncover of darkness."\r\n\r\n"He might\'ve killed us both an hour ago," Marla said then. "But he\r\ndidn\'t. He showed no sign of hostility."\r\n\r\n"She\'s right on that," Ronal admitted. "He ran!"\r\n\r\nThere was silence for a moment, and then Logan spoke again.\r\n\r\n"We could go on like this for hours and get nowhere. Hours that could\r\nbe a lot better spent. We know nothing of the situation on this planet\r\nbeyond the hull of our own ship. I think our best protection is\r\ncompleting repairs as quickly as possible and getting out. Ronal and\r\nMarla can still keep an eye out. If anything happens, we can always get\r\ninto the ship before they reach us. We\'ll all have to remain within the\r\nship at night, of course. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
And without any weapons, that\'s all there is\r\nto do."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the days of feverish work that followed, the life that they all\r\ncould feel was teeming within the hot, moist jungle that surrounded\r\nthem gave little hint of its presence save for an occasional beast-like\r\nscream and the cries of birds. And the nights were quiet save for the\r\nsound of warm breezes riffling their way through lush foliage.\r\n\r\n"But I can feel a thousand eyes upon us for every move we make," Marla\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"It\'ll be all over in a day or so," Ronal reassured her. "Logan says\r\nthat we\'ll be able to blast off without even trying to shift the\r\nship\'s position. Chances are we won\'t even set eyes on our hairy\r\nfriend again, much less any of his tribesmen. Don\'t worry."\r\n\r\nBut it was the next morning that they saw the Hairy One again.\r\n\r\n"He\'s trying to get up into that tree with the fruit on it," Marla\r\nsaid, "but the trunk\'s too big around for him to climb, and the lowest\r\nbranch is too high for him to reach."\r\n\r\n"He seems to be alone," Ronal said.\r\n\r\n"And he doesn\'t even seem to know we\'re still here."\r\n\r\n"I wonder if he really cares," Ronal said, and began walking slowly\r\ntoward the clearing\'s edge.\r\n\r\n"You aren\'t going to--"\r\n\r\n"Got a funny feeling. And I want a closer look. He could get that\r\nfruit, if--"\r\n\r\n"If he could _stand_!" Marla completed. The implications of what Ronal\r\nsuggested came fully upon her for the first time. Quite evidently, she\r\nunderstood now, the all-fours attitude of the Hairy One was not just\r\nfor ease of jungle travel. It was a permanent attitude because the\r\nbeast had not yet attained the ability to stand erect!\r\n\r\n"I\'ve an idea," Ronal said. He quickened his stride. "But you\'d better\r\ngo back with Krist and Logan. It\'s possible that--"\r\n\r\n"I will not! 

=== Chunk 9 ===
And what danger is there? For nearly a week we\'ve been\r\nhere, and although we\'ve all felt uneasy, this is the first we\'ve seen\r\nhim since that first day. There hasn\'t been even a hint of hostility.\r\nWhat more can he be than just a harmless, stupid beast?"\r\n\r\nThe Hairy One halted his tree-climbing efforts when he saw them,\r\nbut made no move to either retreat or advance. As before, he stood\r\nimmobile and watched. Ronal and Marla approached with the palms of\r\ntheir hands opened and outward, hanging limply at their sides. And as\r\nthey approached, Ronal swept the jungle edge with his eyes, to peer as\r\ndeeply into its tangled growth as he could. Nothing moved.\r\n\r\nWithin scant yards of the beast, they stopped.\r\n\r\nThe Hairy One was watching Marla.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRonal dropped to all fours. And it was a peculiar, silent melodrama\r\nthat followed then. A highly-cultured man from a well-ordered,\r\ncivilized galaxy, making a crude attempt to teach a beast to walk, on\r\nthe face of a planet which, but a few days before, he had never known\r\nexisted.\r\n\r\nWhy? Marla wondered. What fascination had there always been between\r\nalien cultures, that had always made one attempt to instruct the\r\nother in its ways? Certainly Ronal was no scientist, no explorer.\r\nYet, as though he were an appointed ambassador of his own kind, he\r\nwas attempting the always risky job of finding a common level of\r\nunderstanding with an alien mind.\r\n\r\nOr perhaps it was just natural curiosity, and an overabundance of\r\nself-confidence!\r\n\r\nRonal had imitated the creature\'s all-fours shamble until he was\r\nbeneath the tree limb.\r\n\r\n"Careful," Marla said. "Don\'t give him the idea you\'re trying to steal\r\nhis fruit, or we will be in trouble."\r\n\r\nFar out from where the fruit hung, Ronal stood up slowly. Then he\r\nraised his arms, opened his hands, touched the limb with his fingers.\r\n\r\nThen he dropped back to the all-fours position, and repeated the\r\nstanding up process.\r\n\r\nThen at length, he pointed to the Hairy One, to the position under the\r\nlimb above which the fruit swung, and backed slowly to where Marla\r\nstood, fascination in her eyes.\r\n\r\nThe Hairy One remained immobile. There seemed no flicker of\r\ncomprehension in his flat, black eyes. Then suddenly, for the quickest\r\nflash of an instant, he came almost erect, his arms half upraised!\r\n\r\nThen he dropped back, as though exhausted and baffled by the effort.\r\n\r\n"He did it!" Ronal exclaimed. "He can understand!"\r\n\r\nRonal went through the weird pantomime again, but although the Hairy\r\nOne stood once again and even accomplished two staggering steps\r\nforward, he dropped back once more without having reached the fruit.\r\n\r\n"We had better go back," Marla said. "He--it--I don\'t think you\r\nshould\'ve, Ronal."\r\n\r\n"No harm done. But before we give up my little experiment--"\r\n\r\nRonal reached up, plucked the fruit and in one fluid motion tossed it\r\nto the Hairy One. And deftly, it was caught!\r\n\r\nAnd as quickly thrown forcefully to the ground!\r\n\r\n"You\'ve angered him, Ronal! You\'ve--"\r\n\r\n"But he could see I wasn\'t stealing it--"\r\n\r\nThe Hairy One did not move. Crouched, he watched them; watched Marla.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuddenly, Ronal was clearing a small area of the thick, carpet-like\r\ngrass. Then in the soft, rich dirt which he had exposed, he began\r\nmaking swift, simple diagrams. They depicted the ship, surrounded by a\r\nforest. Then, pointing first to his crude drawing, then to the Hairy\r\nOne, to themselves, then to the ship, Ronal waited.\r\n\r\nBut the beast did not move.\r\n\r\n"Take him along? Back with us?" Marla whispered.\r\n\r\n"Why not?" Ronal answered. "If our experts could communicate with him,\r\nor at least study him, there\'s no telling--wait!"\r\n\r\nThe Hairy One had started to stand, step forward, then stopped.\r\n\r\n"We had better go, Ronal." Marla was frightened, now. "You\'ve made him\r\nresent us. We should leave him to this world where he belongs, and we\r\nshould return to ours where we belong."\r\n\r\n"One more try. Then, if it doesn\'t work--"\r\n\r\nRonal, almost as though caught in a trance, began to take a slow,\r\ncautious step toward the immobile beast before him. And stepped back\r\nquickly!\r\n\r\nFor the Hairy One had in an instant grabbed from the ground a heavy,\r\nclub-like stick! Yet he had not raised it, but merely held it\r\nmeaningfully, pointed downward.\r\n\r\nRonal stood motionless. The Hairy One watched Marla, then Ronal. Then\r\nhe dropped his club, silently picked up the fruit he had thrown to the\r\nground, and turned. Then he vanished once more into the jungle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA day later, for merely a moment before Logan punched the acceleration\r\nwarning buzzer for take-off and switched on the jet detonators, they\r\nsaw the Hairy One for the last time.\r\n\r\n"Look, Krist! Marla! 

=== Chunk 10 ===
There he is! And by Betelgeuse if he isn\'t\r\n_standing up_!"\r\n\r\nEven at a mile distance they could discern the erect figure of the\r\nmute, enigmatic denizen of this strange, new planet--immobile,\r\nwatching, but on two feet.\r\n\r\n"And on those forelegs of his were more hands than feet--and what\r\nsomeday might be a thumb, to oppose his fingers!" Ronal was saying\r\nquietly.\r\n\r\nMarla and Krist knew what was in Ronal\'s mind. And Marla was glad they\r\nwere about to blast off. There had been something in the way the beast\r\nhad watched them, had watched her--\r\n\r\nThey knew what Ronal was thinking. But it was all they would ever know.\r\n\r\nThey took their places in the acceleration hammocks.\r\n\r\nSeconds later, with a great, shuddering roar, the gleaming Space-yacht\r\nleaped skyward and disappeared into the blue vault of the sky.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Hairy One watched for minutes afterward, then dropped back to all\r\nfours and shambled through the jungle. His legs hurt strangely, and his\r\narms--_\r\n\r\n_Perhaps he should have accepted their offer and gone with them to\r\ntheir bright, shining world._\r\n\r\n_Or, perhaps, taken the woman and started--started what? He could not\r\nremember._\r\n\r\n_He stumbled awkwardly into the overgrown ruin of shattered masonry and\r\ntwisted steel wherein he slept, and laid down._\r\n\r\n_He felt very tired._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
