]\r\n\r\n\r\n"Well, you will soon see for yourself, Marlow. Yes, I know there are\r\npeculiar stories about the place. There are about all places. The young\r\npilots who have been there tell some amusing tales about it."\r\n\r\n"Yes. They say the people there are very polite."\r\n\r\n"That is the honorable ancestor of all understatements. One of the\r\npilots, Conrad, told us that the inhabitants must always carry seven\r\ntypes of eyeglasses with them. None of the Puds, you see, may ever\r\ngaze directly on another. That would be the height of impoliteness.\r\nThey wear amber goggles when they go about their world at large,\r\nand these they wear when they meet a stranger. But, once they are\r\nintroduced to him, then they must thereafter look on him through blue\r\nglasses. But at a blood relative they gaze through red, and at an\r\nin-law through yellow. There are equally interesting colors for other\r\nsituations."\r\n\r\n"I would like to talk to Conrad. Not that I doubt his reports. It is\r\nthe things he did not report that interest me."\r\n\r\n"I thought you knew he had died. Thrombosis, though he was sound enough\r\nwhen first certified."\r\n\r\n"But if they are really people, then it should be possible to\r\nunderstand them."\r\n\r\n"But they are not really people. They are metamorphics. They become\r\npeople only out of politeness."\r\n\r\n"Detail that a little."\r\n\r\n"Oh, they\'re biped and of a size of us. They have a chameleon-like skin\r\nthat can take on any texture they please, and they possess extreme\r\nplasticity of features."\r\n\r\n"You mean they can take on the appearance of people at will?"\r\n\r\n"So Bently reported."\r\n\r\n"I hadn\'t heard of him."\r\n\r\n"Another of the young pilots. According to Bently, not only do the Puds\r\ntake on a human appearance, they take on the appearance of the human\r\nthey encounter. Out of politeness, of course."\r\n\r\n"Quite a tribute, though it seems extreme. Could I talk to Bently?"\r\n\r\n"Also dead. A promising young man. But he reported some of the most\r\namusing aspects of all: the circumlocutions that the Puds use in\r\nspeaking our language. Not only is the Second Person eschewed out of\r\npoliteness, but in a way all the other Persons also. One of them could\r\nnot call you by your name, Marlow. He would have to say: \'One hears of\r\none who hears of one of the noble name of Marlow. One hears of one even\r\nnow in his presence.\'"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Yes, that is quite a polite way of saying it. But it would seem that\r\nwith all their circumlocutions they would be inefficient."\r\n\r\n"Yet they are quite efficient. They do things so well that it is almost\r\nimperative that we learn from them. Yet for all our contacts, for all\r\ntheir extreme politeness coupled with their seeming openness, we have\r\nbeen able to learn almost nothing. We cannot learn the secret of the\r\namazing productivity of their fields. According to Sharper, another of\r\nthe young pilots, they suggest (though so circumspectly that it seems\r\nhardly a suggestion, certainly not a criticism) that if we were more\r\npolite to our own plants, the plants would be more productive for us;\r\nand if we gave the plants the ultimate of politeness, they would give\r\nus the ultimate of production."\r\n\r\n"Could I talk to Sharper, or is he also--"\r\n\r\n"No, he is not dead. He was quite well till the last several days. Now,\r\nhowever, he is ailing, but I believe it will be possible for you to\r\ntalk to him before you leave, if he does not worsen."\r\n\r\n"It would still seem difficult for the Puds to get anything done.\r\nWouldn\'t a superior be too polite to give a reprimand to an inferior?"\r\n\r\n"Probably. But Masters, who visited them, had a theory about it, which\r\nis that the inferior would be so polite and deferential that he would\r\ndo his best to anticipate a wish or a desire, or would go to any\r\nlengths to learn the import of an unvoiced preference."\r\n\r\n"Is Masters one of the young pilots?"\r\n\r\n"No, an old-timer."\r\n\r\n"Now you _do_ interest me."\r\n\r\n"Dead quite a few years. But it is you who interest me, Marlow. I have\r\nbeen told to give you all the information you need about the Polite\r\nPeople of Pudibundia. And on the subject of the Polite People, I must\r\nalso be polite. But--saving your presence, and one hears of one who\r\nhears and all that--what in gehenna is a captain in Homicide on the\r\nSolar Police Force going to Pudibundia about?"\r\n\r\n"About murder. That is all I ever go anywhere about. We once had a\r\nprivate motto that we would go to the end of the Earth to solve a case."\r\n\r\n"And now you have amended your motto to \'to the end of the Earth and\r\nbeyond\'?"\r\n\r\n"We have."\r\n\r\n"But what have the Polite People to do with murder? Crime is unknown on\r\nPudibundia."\r\n\r\n"We believe, saving their feelings, that it may not be unknown there.\r\nAnd what I am going to find out is this. There have been pilots for\r\nmany years who have brought back stories of the Puds, and there are\r\nstill a few--a very few--young pilots alive to tell those stories. What\r\nI am going to find out is why there are no old pilots around telling\r\nthose stories."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt wasn\'t much of a trip for a tripper, six weeks. And Marlow was\r\nwell received. His host also assumed the name of Marlow out of\r\npoliteness. It would have been impossible to render his own name in\r\nhuman speech, and it would have been impossible for him to conceive\r\nof using any name except that of his guest, with its modifiers. Yet\r\nthere was no confusion. Marlow was Marlow, and his host was the\r\nOne-Million-Times-Lesser-Marlow.\r\n\r\n"We could progress much faster," said Marlow, "if we dispensed with\r\nthese formalities."\r\n\r\n"Or assumed them as already spoken," said the\r\nOne-Million-Times-Lesser-Marlow. "For this, in private, but only in the\r\nstrictest privacy, we use the deferential ball. Within it are all the\r\nformulae written minutely. You have but to pass the ball from hand to\r\nhand every time you speak, and it is as if the amenities were spoken.\r\nI will give you this for the time of your stay. I beg you never to\r\nforget to pass it from hand to hand every time you speak. Should you\r\nforget, I would not, of course, be allowed to notice it. But when you\r\nwere gone, I should be forced to kill myself for the shame of it. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
For\r\nprivate reasons I wish to avoid this and therefore beseech you to be\r\ncareful."\r\n\r\nThe One-Million-Times-Lesser-Marlow (hereafter to be called OMTLM\r\nfor convenience but not out of any lack of politeness) gave Marlow\r\na deferential ball, about the size of a ping-pong ball. And so they\r\ntalked.\r\n\r\n"As a police official, I am particularly interested in the crime\r\nsituation on Pud," said Marlow. "An index of zero is--well, if I could\r\nfind a politer word I would use it--suspicious. And as you are, as well\r\nas I can determine, the head police official here, though in politeness\r\nyour office would have another name, I am hoping that you can give me\r\ninformation."\r\n\r\n"Saving your grace, and formula of a formula, what would you have me\r\ntell you about?"\r\n\r\n"Suppose that a burglar (for politeness sake called something else)\r\nwere apprehended by a policeman (likewise), what would happen?"\r\n\r\n"Why, the policeman (not so called, and yet we must be frank) would\r\nrattle his glottis in the prescribed manner."\r\n\r\n"Rattle his gl--I see. He would clear his throat with the appropriate\r\nsound. And then the burglar (not so called)?"\r\n\r\n"Would be covered with shame, it is true, but not fatally. For the\r\npeace of his own soul, he would leave the site in as dignified a manner\r\nas possible."\r\n\r\n"With or without boodle?"\r\n\r\n"Naturally without. One apprehended in the act is obliged to abandon\r\nhis loot. That is only common politeness."\r\n\r\n"I see. And if the burglar (not so called) remains unapprehended? How\r\nis the loss of the goods or property recorded?"\r\n\r\n"It goes into the coefficient of general diminution of merchandise,\r\nwhich is to say shrinkage, wastage or loss. At certain times and places\r\nthis coefficient becomes alarmingly large. Then it is necessary to use\r\nextraordinary care; and in extreme cases a thrice-removed burglar may\r\nbecome so ashamed of himself that he will die."\r\n\r\n"That he will die of shame? Is that a euphemism?"\r\n\r\n"Let us say that it is a euphemism of a euphemism."\r\n\r\n"Thrice-removed, I imagine. And what of other crimes?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere OMTLM rattled his glottis in a nervous manner, and Marlow\r\nhurriedly transferred his deferential ball to the other hand, having\r\nnearly forgotten it.\r\n\r\n"There being no crime, we can hardly speak of _other_ crimes," said\r\nOMTLM. "But perhaps in another matter of speaking, you refer to--"\r\n\r\n"Crimes of violence," said Marlow.\r\n\r\n"Saving your presence, and formula of a formula, what would we have to\r\nbe violent about? What possible cause?"\r\n\r\n"The usual: greed, lust, jealousy, anger, revenge, plain perversity."\r\n\r\n"Here also it is possible for one to die of shame, sometimes the\r\noffender, sometimes the victim, sometimes both. A jealous person\r\nmight permit both his wife and her paramour to die of shame. And the\r\nState in turn might permit him to perish likewise, unless there were\r\ncircumstances to modify the degree of shame; then he might still\r\ncontinue to live, often in circumscribed circumstances, for a set\r\nnumber of years. Each case must be decided on its own merits.

=== Chunk 4 ===
"\r\n\r\n"I understand your meaning. But why build a fence around it?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know what you mean.

=== Chunk 5 ===
"\r\n\r\n"I believe that you do. Why are the Polite People of Pudibundia so\r\npolite? Is it simply custom?"\r\n\r\n"It is more than that," said the polite Pud.\r\n\r\n"Then there is a real reason for it? And can you tell it to me?"\r\n\r\n"There is a real reason for it. I cannot tell it to you now, though,\r\nand perhaps not ever. But there is a chance that you may be given a\r\ndemonstration of it just before you leave. And if you are very wise,\r\nyou may be able then to guess the reason. I believe that there are\r\nseveral who have guessed it. I hope that we will have time for other\r\ndiscussions before you leave our sphere. And I sincerely do hope\r\nthat your stay on Pudibundia is a pleasant one. And now, saving your\r\npresence, we must part. Formula of a formula."\r\n\r\n"Formula of a formula and all that," said Marlow, and went to discover\r\nthe pleasures of Pudibundia.\r\n\r\nAmong the pleasures of Pud was Mitzi (Miniature Image a\r\nthousand-times-removed of the Zestful Irma) who had now shaped up into\r\nsomething very nice. And shaped up is the correct term.\r\n\r\nAt first Marlow was shocked by the appearance of all the females he met\r\non Pud. Crude-featured, almost horse-faced, how could they all look\r\nlike that? And he was even more shocked when he finally realized the\r\nreason. He had become used to the men there looking like himself out of\r\npoliteness. And this--this abomination--was the female version of his\r\nown appearance!\r\n\r\nBut he was a man of resources. He took from his pocket a small picture\r\nof Irma that he always carried, and showed it to the most friendly of\r\nthe girls.\r\n\r\n"Could you possibly--?"\r\n\r\n"Look like that? 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Why, of course. Let me study it for a moment. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
Now,\r\nthen."\r\n\r\nSo the girl assumed the face of Irma.\r\n\r\n"Incredible," said Marlow, "except Irma is red-headed."\r\n\r\n"You have only to ask. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
The photo is not colored and so I did not know.\r\nWe will try this shade to start with."\r\n\r\n"Close, but could you turn it just a little darker?

=== Chunk 9 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Of course."\r\n\r\nAnd there she was Irma of the most interesting face and wonderful hair.\r\nBut the picture had been of the face only. Below that, the girl was a\r\nsack. If only there were some way to convey what was lacking.\r\n\r\n"You still are not pleased with me," said the Miniature Image a\r\nthousand-times-removed of the Zestful Irma (Mitzi). "But you have only\r\nto demonstrate. Show me with your hands."\r\n\r\nMarlow with his hands sculptured in the air the figure of Irma as he\r\nremembered it, and Mitzi assumed the form, first face on, then face\r\naway, then in profile. And when they had it roughly, they perfected it,\r\na little more here, a little less there. But there were points where\r\nhis memory failed him.\r\n\r\n"If you could only give me an idea of the convolutions of her ears,"\r\nsaid Mitzi, "and the underlying structure of the metatarsus. My only\r\ndesire is to please. Or shall I improvise where you do not remember?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, do that, Mitzi."\r\n\r\nAnd how that girl could improvise!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMarlow and Mitzi were now buddies. They made a large evening of it.\r\nThey tied one on; formula of a formula, but they tied one on. 

=== Chunk 10 ===
They\r\nwent on a thrice-removed bender. At the Betelgeuse Bar and Grill,\r\nthey partook of the cousin of the cousin of the alcohol itself in the\r\nform of the nono-rhumbezoid, made of nine kinds of rum. At the B-flat\r\nStarlight Club, they listened to the newest and most exciting music on\r\nall Pudibundia. At Alligator John\'s, one checks his inhibitions at the\r\ndoor. Here one also checks his deferential ball. Of course the formulae\r\nare built into the walls and at each exchange it is always assumed that\r\nthey are said.\r\n\r\nBut the Iris Room is really the ultimate. The light comes through\r\nseven different colors of glass, and it is very dim when it arrives.\r\nAnd there the more daring remove their goggles entirely and go about\r\nwithout them in the multi-colored twilight. This is illegal. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
It is\r\neven foolhardy. There is no Earthly equivalent to it. To divest oneself\r\nand disport with Nudists would be tame in comparison. But Mitzi and her\r\nfriends were of the reckless generation, and the Iris Room was their\r\nrendezvous.\r\n\r\nThe orgy will not be detailed here. The floor show was wild. Yet we\r\ncannot credit the rumor that the comedian was so crude as to look\r\ndirectly at the audience even in that colored twilight; or they so\r\ngauche as to laugh outright at the jokes, they who had been taught\r\nalways to murmur, "One knows of one who knows of one who ventures to\r\nsmile." Yet there was no doubting that the Iris Room was a lively\r\nplace. And when they left it at dawn, Marlow was pleased and sleepy and\r\ntipsy.\r\n\r\nThere was a week of pleasure on Pudibundia: swimming with Mitzi down\r\nat West Beach, gourmandizing with Mitzi at Gastrophiles, dancing with\r\nMitzi, pub-crawling, romancing, carrying on generally. The money\r\nexchange was favorable and Marlow was on an expense account. It was a\r\ndelightful time.\r\n\r\nBut still he did not forget the job he was on, and in the midst of his\r\npleasure he sought always for information.\r\n\r\n"When I return here," he said slyly, "we will do the many things that\r\ntime does not allow. When I come back here--"\r\n\r\n"But you will not return," said Mitzi. "Nobody ever does."\r\n\r\n"And why not? It is surely a pleasant place to return to. Why won\'t I\r\nreturn?"\r\n\r\n"If you cannot guess, then I cannot tell you. Do you have to know why?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I have to know why. That is why I came here, to find out. To find\r\nout why the young men who come here will never be able to return here,\r\nor to anywhere else."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t tell you.

=== Chunk 12 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Then give me a clue."\r\n\r\n"In the Iris Room was a clue. It was not till the color-filtered light\r\nintruded between us that we might safely take off our goggles. I would\r\nsave you if I could. I want you to come back. But those higher in\r\nauthority make the decisions. When you leave, you will not return here,\r\nor anywhere else. But already one has spoken to one who has spoken to\r\none who has spoken too much."\r\n\r\n"There is a point beyond which politeness is no longer a virtue, Mitzi."\r\n\r\n"I know. 

=== Chunk 13 ===
If I could change it, I would."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo the period of the visit was at an end, and Marlow was at his last\r\nconference with OMTLM, following which he would leave Pudibundia,\r\nperhaps forever.\r\n\r\n"Is there anything at all else you would like to know?" asked OMTLM.\r\n\r\n"There is almost _everything_ that I still want to know. I have found\r\nout nothing."\r\n\r\n"Then ask."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know how. If I knew the questions to ask, it is possible that\r\nI would already know the answers."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that is entirely possible."\r\n\r\nOMTLM seemed to look at him with amused eyes. And yet the eyes were\r\nhidden behind purple goggles. Marlow had never seen the eyes of OMTLM.\r\nHe had never seen the eyes of any of the Puds. Even in the Iris Room,\r\nin that strangely colored light, it had not been possible to see their\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n"Are you compelling me to do something?" asked Marlow.\r\n\r\n"I may be compelling you to think of the question that has eluded you."\r\n\r\n"Would you swear that I have not been given some fatal sickness?"\r\n\r\n"I can swear that to the very best of my knowledge you have not."\r\n\r\n"Are you laughing at me with your eyes?"\r\n\r\n"No. My eyes have compassion for you."\r\n\r\n"I have to see them."\r\n\r\n"You are asking that?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. I believe the answer to my question is there," Marlow said firmly.\r\n\r\nOMTLM took off his purple goggles. His were clear, intelligent eyes\r\nand there was genuine compassion in them.\r\n\r\n"Thank you," said Marlow. "If the answer is there, it still eludes me.\r\nI have failed in my mission for information. But I will return again. I\r\nwill still find out what it is that is wrong here."\r\n\r\n"No, you will not return."\r\n\r\n"What will prevent me?" asked Marlow.\r\n\r\n"Your death in a very few weeks."\r\n\r\n"What will I die of?"\r\n\r\n"What did all your young pilots die of?"\r\n\r\n"But you swore that you did not know of any sickness I could have\r\ncaught here!" Marlow cried.\r\n\r\n"That was true when I said it. It was not true a moment later."\r\n\r\n"Did all the pilots ask to see your eyes?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. All. Curiosity is a failing of you Earthlings."\r\n\r\n"Is it that the direct gaze of the Puds kills?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. Even ourselves it would kill. That is why we have our eyes always\r\nshielded. That is also why we erect another shield: that of our ritual\r\npoliteness, so that we may never forget that too intimate an encounter\r\nof our persons may be fatal."\r\n\r\n"Then you have just murdered me?"\r\n\r\n"Let us say rather that one hears of one who hears of one who killed\r\nunwillingly."\r\n\r\n"Why did you do it to me?" demanded Marlow.\r\n\r\n"You asked to see my eyes. It would not be polite to refuse."\r\n\r\n"It takes you several weeks to kill. I can do it in a few seconds."\r\n\r\n"You would be wrong to try. Our second glance kills instantly.

=== Chunk 14 ===
"\r\n\r\n"Let\'s see if it\'s faster than a gun!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut OMTLM had not lied.\r\n\r\nIt is not polite to lie on Pudibundia.\r\n\r\nMarlow died instantly.\r\n\r\nAnd that is why (though you may sometimes hear a young pilot tell\r\namusing stories immediately--oh, very immediately--on his return from\r\nPudibundia) you will never find an old pilot who has ever been there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s The Polite People of Pudibundia, by R.
