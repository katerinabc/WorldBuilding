"I\'m picking him up at the spaceway," she said.\r\n"We\'re supposed to go dining and dancing tonight." She stopped pacing.\r\n"It\'s my birthday. I\'m thirty today."\r\n\r\nAnd I was twenty-four and in love. Six years between us. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
So what? 

=== Chunk 4 ===
I\r\ndidn\'t give a damn. I wanted to marry her, to live with her.\r\n\r\n"I\'m thirty," she said again. "Do you mind?"\r\n\r\n"I know your age. Why bring it up?"\r\n\r\n"Someday you\'ll find out you married an old woman. _If_ we ever do\r\nmarry."\r\n\r\n"Stop it." I got off the bed, went to her. "Just tell me what to do\r\nand I\'ll do it."\r\n\r\n"Do you love me?" she looked up at me.\r\n\r\n"You know I do."\r\n\r\n"Say it."\r\n\r\n"I love you."\r\n\r\n"Never stop saying that." She put up her face and I kissed her. A\r\nlong hard kiss. She broke away. "You\'ll be in back in the racer. Just\r\ncrouch low. As soon as we\'re away from the spaceway you hit him with\r\nthe wrench. It has to be quick and sure. Then we carry him up to the\r\napartment and drop him out the window."\r\n\r\nI shuddered a little as she talked. She was so calm about the whole\r\nthing.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll have plenty of time to get out. It\'ll be listed as a suicide.\r\nHe\'s been sick for a long time. His doctor will testify to that. He was\r\nso sick and worried he jumped to his death."\r\n\r\nShe stared at me hard. "Is it all clear?"\r\n\r\n"Yes." I looked at her. Her long blond hair, her oval face, the slim\r\nwhite column that was her throat. "It\'s all clear. Like glass."\r\n\r\nI poured myself a drink. I needed it. I was going to need a lot more.\r\n\r\n"We won\'t be able to see each other for a long time," she said. She\r\nwatched me drink. "We don\'t want to give our friends something to talk\r\nabout."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t like not seeing you."\r\n\r\nShe patted my face. I put down my drink, caged her slender hand in\r\nmine, and kissed her wrist. I saw the light blue veins criss-crossing\r\nunder the delicate skin.\r\n\r\nI brought her close to me. I kissed her warm lips. "Baby," I breathed.\r\n"Diane, baby."\r\n\r\n"Paul, listen to me. We haven\'t much time.

"\r\n\r\n"All right, sweet." I kissed her again.\r\n\r\n"Come on. We can\'t afford to get there late."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI crouched low in the back of the racer. I heard the street noises,\r\nthe gab of the night crowds, the not-so-mild cursings of the taxi-jet\r\ndrivers.\r\n\r\nIt all seemed so unreal. Back there, on my haunches, a wrench gripped\r\ntight in my sweaty hand. I was going to kill a man. A man I knew, a man\r\nI respected. And for a woman. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
All for a woman. I thought about getting\r\nup and telling Diane to go to hell and to get herself another stooge. I\r\nthought about a lot of things. Then I thought of Diane. Her sweet white\r\nbody. The way she sighed when I kissed her hard. And I knew I was going\r\nto go through with it.\r\n\r\nThe racer stopped, its jets cut off. I heard the hum as the door opened\r\nand she got out.\r\n\r\nThis was it. I sweated. It dripped down in an endless stream.\r\n\r\nThe seconds went by. Then the minutes.\r\n\r\nThey got in and the door hummed shut and I heard their laughter\r\nblending together. They settled back and the jets roared. The racer\r\nwoke up to new life and it shot away.\r\n\r\n"How was the trip?" I heard Diane asking.\r\n\r\n"Cold. And I\'m not sure it was worth it. Those Martians drive a hard\r\nbargain." He coughed. "Diane, you\'re not too set on going out tonight,\r\nare you?"\r\n\r\n"Why?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"I thought how nice it would be if we spent the evening at home."\r\n\r\n"Just as you say, Roger."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t care?"\r\n\r\n"Of course not."\r\n\r\nShe was so calm, so damn calm. There would never be another like Diane.\r\n\r\n"You won\'t regret it," Roger promised.\r\n\r\n"My, but this boulevard is deserted," she said. "Not a soul in sight.

"\r\n\r\nThat was for my benefit. It was my cue.\r\n\r\nI sat up silently.\r\n\r\nHe saw me then in the rear-view mirror. "What the hell?" He started to\r\nturn.\r\n\r\nMy arm sprang alive. The wrench thudded against his skull. A half cry\r\nspilled from his lips. Then his head fell forward on his chest.\r\n\r\n"Hit him again," Diane urged.\r\n\r\n"But--"\r\n\r\n"Do as I say."\r\n\r\nI hit him again, hard.\r\n\r\nIt was done. I settled back. The wrench was still in my hand. I looked\r\nat it, then let it fall.\r\n\r\n"Are you all right?" Diane asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes," I said. "Why shouldn\'t I be?"\r\n\r\n"You\'re not going to be sick, are you?"\r\n\r\n"No! You think I\'m a kid?"\r\n\r\n"You did it for an old woman."\r\n\r\n"Stop it."\r\n\r\n"Today is my birthday, don\'t you know? I\'m thirty."\r\n\r\n"Shut up."\r\n\r\n"I wonder what he got for my birthday."\r\n\r\n"Please."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry. Really I am. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
I feel like talking. If I don\'t I think I\'d\r\nscream."\r\n\r\nSo I let her talk. I didn\'t answer her. She babbled away like she was\r\ncrazy. She kept it up till we got to their apartment.\r\n\r\nDiane got out first and made sure the way was clear. "We\'ll use the\r\nback stairs," she said when she got back. "We both can manage him."\r\n\r\nIt was dark and it was late and we didn\'t see anybody. We went through\r\nthe service entrance. It was too heavy a load for me to do it alone.\r\nTwo flights up. Diane helped me with him.\r\n\r\nI breathed easier when we were in the marble hall outside the\r\napartment. She quickly unlocked the heavy plastic door and we got him\r\ninside. She fumbled for the inner-lighting switch.\r\n\r\n"Happy birthday," they shouted.\r\n\r\nNow I knew why Roger had wanted to spend the evening at home.\r\n\r\nWe stood there, Diane and myself, with Roger between us.\r\n\r\nThen they stopped shouting and stared at us. I thought they would never\r\nstop staring.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
