]\r\n\r\n\r\nMister 3 took the small, gray box from his pocket. Smiling, he handed\r\nit to Mr. 7.\r\n\r\n"Wait!" exclaimed Shalimar Smith.\r\n\r\n"Sorry," said Mr. 7, pressing the red button on the right-hand side of\r\nthe box.\r\n\r\nShalimar Smith disappeared from the room.\r\n\r\n"An excellent plan, indeed," commented Mr. 1.\r\n\r\nMessrs. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 nodded agreement and muttered among\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n"And now," pursued Mr. 7, "Stage Two." He pressed the green button on\r\nthe left-hand side of the gray box.\r\n\r\nThe Messrs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 also disappeared from the room.\r\n\r\nShalimar Smith\'s living room stood empty.\r\n\r\nImmediately after Mr. 7 had pressed the red button on the right-hand\r\nside of the gray box, Shalimar Smith found himself sitting comfortably\r\nin a reclining seat on a fast-moving train. After contemplating the\r\nsudden transition and making himself thoroughly dizzy, he turned in\r\nsome alarm to considering where he was going. He peered out the window,\r\ntrying to make something from the mixture of blackness and lights\r\nspinning by, overlaid by stationary reflections from inside the car.\r\n\r\n"Your ticket, sir," said the conductor for the second time.\r\n\r\n"Eh--oh!" Shalimar looked up, felt in the breast pocket of his coat for\r\na ticket that was not there. "Here it--" he pulled the pocket inside\r\nout--"isn\'t," he finished lamely.\r\n\r\n"That\'s nice," said the conductor sarcastically.\r\n\r\nShalimar groaned and dug into his other pockets, distributing their\r\ncontents over the seat. Finally he gave a cry of jubilation, pulled\r\nhis hand from his inside coat pocket and handed the conductor a small\r\nsquare of cardboard.\r\n\r\nThe conductor punched three heart-shaped holes through Shalimar\'s\r\nname and handed him back his driver\'s license. Shalimar gazed at it\r\nstupidly. "I--must have lost it," he ventured.\r\n\r\nThe thoroughly enraged official grabbed Shalimar by the scruff of his\r\ncoat in an undignified way, pulling the emergency cord with his other\r\nhand. He shoved the unfortunate man down the aisle of the car as the\r\ntrain slowed to a halt.\r\n\r\n"Stop!" shouted Shalimar.\r\n\r\n"_Why?_" grunted the conductor savagely, shoving him out the door\r\nas the speed of the train diminished. Shalimar landed on his hands and\r\nknees, rolled for several yards, and skidded to a halt on his stomach.\r\nHe sat up and watched in exasperation as the train gathered speed and\r\nroared away into the darkness.\r\n\r\nFinally he stood up, rubbing his head with one hand and feeling of his\r\nskinned knee with the other, and took stock of his surroundings. A moon\r\nin quarter phase illuminated dimly the gleaming lines of the railroad\r\ntracks, showed a tree in silhouette on a hill not far away. Clouds\r\nscudded across the sky. Shalimar endeavoured to ascertain where he\r\nwas, gave up, and headed toward the hill and the silhouetted tree. In\r\nthe far distance the whistle of a train wailed mournfully.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom the top of the hill Shalimar looked over a country of rolling\r\nplains and grainfields. A single light shone yellow about a half-mile\r\noff--probably a farm-house. Shalimar headed off toward the light,\r\nmentally cursing the monotonous chirping clamor of crickets and other\r\nnocturnal insects. He was trying to remember something--something of\r\nvital importance--something that he had to remember before it was\r\ntoo late. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
The memory hung there, just below the surface of conscious\r\nthought, defying him, taunting him. Eventually the lighted window\r\nshowed clearly through a nearby grove of trees, and the outlines of a\r\nsmall farm-house stood out against the dim sky.\r\n\r\nHe walked up the gravel path and knocked on the door. Steps sounded\r\ninside and the door opened, a crack of light shining out onto the\r\nground. A face peered at him, withdrew, and the door opened wide. A\r\nfigure stood silhouetted against the light.\r\n\r\n"Come in," said Mr. 7.\r\n\r\n"Oh, _no_!" Shalimar turned and started to run off. Mr. 7 grasped\r\nhim firmly by the coat-collar and dragged him back into the house.\r\n\r\n"Let me go," gurgled Shalimar, gagging as his shirt collar pressed\r\ntightly against his throat.\r\n\r\n"Not until--" Mr. 7 began, his face suddenly brightening. Footsteps\r\nscraped up the gravel path and Messrs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 strode\r\ninto the room. Mr. 3 expeditiously took the small, gray box from his\r\npocket and handed it to Mr. 7. "Nowhere around here," he said briskly.\r\n"Probably off another psychological sidetrack."\r\n\r\nMr. 7\'s hand released Shalimar\'s coat-collar and poised over the red\r\nbutton on the right-hand side of the box.\r\n\r\n"Wait," cried Shalimar.\r\n\r\nMr. 7 depressed the button. Shalimar Smith disappeared from the room.\r\n\r\nMr. 7 then pressed the green button on the left-hand side of the box.\r\nThe Messrs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 vanished in like manner. The silent\r\nemptiness of the room was broken only by the sound of the bound and\r\ngagged farmer grunting from inside a handy closet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShalimar Smith abruptly felt himself falling. He had just realized\r\nthat fact when something cold, hard and wet slapped against his face\r\nand engulfed him, and he submerged gaspingly in the water. He came up,\r\nchoking and treading water, and took his bearings.\r\n\r\nHe had just done a perfect jackknife from the high board of the public\r\nswimming pool in Stockton, Ohio. The quarter moon glinted faintly\r\noff the surface of the water. He was aware of the fact that he was\r\nstill fully dressed, and that his clothes were soaking up water at an\r\nalarming rate, bearing him down.\r\n\r\nHe swam clumsily over to the edge of the pool and climbed out. Then\r\nhe sat down on the edge and began contemplating this new facet of the\r\nwhole fantastic experience. He knew the pool well enough--had swum in\r\nit many times when he had lived in this small town in Ohio, before\r\ngetting married and going to New York.\r\n\r\nThe question of _how_ he had gotten here bothered him not so much\r\nas _why_ he had. Something was trying to come to the surface of\r\nhis mind again--the same urgent something which had bothered him after\r\nhe had been thrown off the train. He grasped at the memory, cursing\r\nas it eluded him deftly time and again. When footsteps sounded on the\r\nconcrete walk leading to the pool he looked up.\r\n\r\nIt was a night watchman. The man was swinging a flashlight at his side,\r\nthrowing the beam around him as he walked. Probably he had heard the\r\nsplash and was coming to investigate. Shalimar sighed and stood up.\r\n\r\nThe flashlight beam swung toward him, illuminating him embarrassingly\r\nand causing him to blink at the spot of white light before him. A\r\nsuspicious voice asked, "What\'re you doin\' here this time of night?\r\nPool\'s closed."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know--" Shalimar thought hard. "I--was walking in my sleep and\r\nfell into the pool."\r\n\r\n"With all your clothes on?" The beam of light lowered and Shalimar\r\ncould see again. The watchman stood outlined against the darker trees,\r\nhis face a blurred shadow.\r\n\r\n"Yes, er--I fell asleep in my chair as I was reading the paper."\r\n\r\n"Heh! At one o\'clock in the morning? Where you live?"\r\n\r\nShalimar hadn\'t known it was so late. He racked his brains. "Just over\r\nthe hill on Walnut Street."\r\n\r\nThe watchman stepped up and looked him over in the light of the flash.\r\n"Hmmm. Don\'t know you--must be new in town. You the one who bought the\r\nold Schultz place?"\r\n\r\n"Why ... 

=== Chunk 4 ===
yeah."\r\n\r\n"Heh! Thought that was a woman. Well, I guess it\'s okay. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Better watch\r\nwhere you wander off to at night, though."\r\n\r\n"Yeah." Shalimar breathed a sigh of relief and began to walk off.\r\n"Good-night."\r\n\r\n"Better take one of them anty-histamines when you get home. Sound like\r\nyou\'re comin\' down with a cold. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
Good-night!" The watchman strolled back\r\ntoward his shack.\r\n\r\nShalimar gulped. Close. He began trying to remember again.\r\n\r\n"Hey!" yelled the watchman suddenly. "Jest thought of somethin\'. How\'d\r\nyou get into the pool? I\'d\'ve seen you if you come in the gate, and the\r\nother three sides is walled off!

=== Chunk 7 ===
"\r\n\r\nShalimar had hoped the watchman wouldn\'t think of that. He began to run\r\ndown the driveway.\r\n\r\n"Wait up!" cried the watchman. "Stop, or I\'ll shoot!"\r\n\r\nShalimar ran. Three shots buzzed by him, then he was safely around the\r\ncorner and away. He ducked down a tree-lined street, ran around the\r\ncorner house and off across the back yard. Behind him he heard the man\r\nrun on down the main street, yelling.\r\n\r\nThis was bad. The old fool would wake up the authorities, if not the\r\nwhole town. Why did that damned button transport him into such messes?\r\nHe ducked down an alley and into a small toolshed which he noticed at\r\nthe end of it. What to do next? He stood in the shed, panting. As he\r\nbacked up to the far wall, something brushed his face. A light cord! He\r\npulled on it; the shed exploded into light.\r\n\r\nMr. 7 stood leaning against the far side of the shed, arms folded\r\nacross chest. "Failed again," he remarked philosophically.\r\n\r\nShalimar leaped back with a cry.\r\n\r\nThe Messrs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, standing along the farther wall,\r\nmurmured among themselves in interested tones.\r\n\r\n"He has too many memory sidetracks," remarked Mr. 3, handing Mr. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
7\r\nthe small gray box. "It certainly wasn\'t here. Nothing to do but\r\ntry again." 

=== Chunk 9 ===
Mr. 7\'s finger hovered over the red button on the box\'s\r\nright-hand side.\r\n\r\nShalimar braced himself.\r\n\r\nMr. 7 shoved violently down on the button. Shalimar behaved in the\r\nexpected fashion; he vanished.\r\n\r\nMr. 7 then pressed the green button on the left side. He and his\r\ncolleagues followed after Shalimar.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nImmediately after Mr. 7 pressed the aforementioned red button, Shalimar\r\nSmith felt a violent pain on the top of his head, followed shortly by\r\nanother. He deduced that somebody was beating him over the head with\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\n"Peeping Tom!" shrieked the outraged woman. "Help! Police!" 

=== Chunk 10 ===
She poised\r\nthe vase for another blow. Shalimar winced as it descended and took\r\nstock of where he was.\r\n\r\nHe found that he was hanging by his fingertips from a ledge about\r\nfive stories up on an apartment building in what must be a rather\r\nlarge city. It was, in fact, a window ledge, and immediately above\r\nhim, leaning from the window, was a woman in a rather flimsy negligee,\r\nscreaming and wielding a spiked heel on top of his defenseless cranium.\r\nHe groaned as the heel descended for the fifth time on his skull then\r\nthe shoe slipped from her grasp and fell to the street below. He\r\nremembered vaguely that he had once lived in an apartment like the one\r\nto whose window ledge he clung--probably, even, the same apartment--and\r\nthat he had been accustomed to wash the windows from the outside. That\r\nexplained his position. 

=== Chunk 11 ===
Now the shoe had been replaced by another\r\nmakeshift weapon. A goldfish bowl came down upon him, showering him\r\nwith fish, water and splinters of glass. Below, a cruising precinct\r\npolice car had stopped and several men sporting the blue uniform of the\r\nLaw were looking up.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The goldfish bowl showered him with fish, water and\r\nsplinters of glass.]\r\n\r\n"Come down from there," demanded a wrathful voice from below.\r\n\r\n"How?" gasped Shalimar weakly.\r\n\r\n"Come down, I say!" shouted the voice. Several people in adjoining\r\napartments were looking out their respective windows at the scene and\r\nthoroughly enjoying his discomfiture. Shalimar cursed them and edged\r\nhis way along the ledge until he felt another one under his feet. He\r\ncame to a standing position on the lower one, hugging the wall of the\r\nbuilding. The lady in the negligee poised a vase of flowers preparatory\r\nto heaving at him.\r\n\r\n"Hell!" groaned Shalimar, ducking as the vase shattered against the\r\nwall above his head. He edged his way around the corner of the building\r\nwhere the lady could no longer see him, and slipped into an open window.\r\n\r\nA man lay sleeping in the apartment he had just entered. Praying that\r\nthe man was a heavy sleeper, Shalimar tip-toed through the apartment\r\nand out into the hall. By now, he imagined, the place was a bedlam. The\r\nelevator was coming up--loaded with police, no doubt--and footsteps\r\nwere ascending the stairs. Shalimar spotted a weathered door and ducked\r\nthrough it.\r\n\r\nHe emerged on the roof. Looking over the edge, he was immediately\r\nspotted from below. Cries of, "There he is!" and "On the roof!"\r\nfloated to his horrified ears. He ran across the room and jumped to\r\nan adjoining one. He zig-zagged across it, keeping well away from the\r\nedges, and reached yet another adjoining roof. There he popped into\r\na small utility shed. Stairs led down, and Shalimar followed them,\r\nnot bothering to worry where they went. He raced down six flights and\r\nemerged in the basement.\r\n\r\nDark--too dark to see anything--but there was no mistaking that voice.\r\n\r\n"Wrong again," said Mr. 7 cheerfully.\r\n\r\nShalimar couldn\'t see, but he knew that Mr. 7 was pressing the small\r\nred button. There was not enough light for anybody to see that Shalimar\r\nhad once more vanished.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nApparently, nothing had happened. Shalimar waited expectantly. The\r\ndarkness was as blank as ever. Shalimar looked about him, felt the air\r\nabout him. Nothing. He took several steps forward.\r\n\r\n_BAM!_\r\n\r\nShalimar fell back. No mistaking that rough surface. He had just bumped\r\ninto a tree. Cautiously, he approached it again, feeling in front of\r\nhim with his hands. Presently he encountered the rough bark; he could\r\nput his arms around the tree. He felt upward--and got a surprise.\r\n\r\nIt was broken off at the top--rather, burnt or charred off.\r\n\r\n"_Why?_"\r\n\r\nHis memory went to work again. He was getting closer now, much closer.\r\nSomething was coming to the surface of his conscious mind, something\r\nthat he had to remember, something--\r\n\r\nHe noticed then that it was lighter. A wind was blowing, the sky showed\r\npalely overhead. Clouds were obscuring the stars and moon. Vague\r\noutlines of other blasted trees showed against the dull sky. The ground\r\nwasn\'t the way ground _should_ be ... glassy ... hard....\r\n\r\nHe knew this place. But where? When?\r\n\r\nThen he saw it, the tall thing, cylindrical and with a pointed nose\r\nshoved at the sky. He began to remember, though it came slowly. He\r\nthought, the tall thing, with a tapered nose silhouetted against the\r\nsky, was....\r\n\r\n_Home._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"I presume you have by now broken away from the limitations of your\r\ndisintegrating Earth-personality," said a familiar voice.\r\n\r\nMr. 7! 

=== Chunk 12 ===
And he _knew_ Mr. 7!\r\n\r\n"When we arrived--almost twenty years ago--in the role of a Galactic\r\nstudy-group assigned to determine whether the planet Earth was yet\r\nfit for full Galactic citizenship," said Mr. 7 slowly, "we found it\r\nnecessary to assume the roles, separately, of representative beings of\r\nEarth, in order to obtain what information we required without arousing\r\nsuspicion. To do this it was necessary, through standard psychological\r\nprocedure, to isolate the larger portion of our complete Galactic\r\npersonalities and to leave only a small pseudopersonality, completely\r\nequipped with Earth-memories, under which guise we might proceed with\r\nour studies.\r\n\r\n"In order to assure complete control of the Earth-personality, it was\r\nof course necessary to isolate the Galactic one completely and further\r\nto remove all knowledge of its existence until such a predetermined\r\ntime as we would be finished with our work and ready to return home."\r\n\r\nMr. 7 droned on. Shalimar nodded--and remembered.\r\n\r\n"Our study of Earth now being finished, we shall return to our\r\nheadquarters. We could not return, however, until we located the ship\r\nin which we had come--and _you_ were the key to that."\r\n\r\nShalimar remembered now. He was ... _he was_....\r\n\r\n"You gave us a rather hard time," continued Mr. 7.\r\n\r\n"Because my personality was the most psychologically malleable,"\r\nShalimar said slowly, "I was chosen to hide the ship where it would\r\nbe safe until we required it. The seven of you teleported to the\r\nEarth\'s surface and waited while I hid the ship--where you did not\r\nknow its location. Then I alone knew where the ship was, and because I\r\nwas the most malleable, my Earth-personality was the most foolproof.\r\nTherefore it was extremely unlikely that in any moments of duress or\r\npsychological strain, I would babble the location of the ship--which\r\nit was imperative to guard."\r\n\r\n"But," said Mr. 7, "_your_ Earth-personality was _too_\r\nwell-integrated. The location of the ship was locked somewhere in\r\nyour subconscious and wouldn\'t come out. The only thing we could do\r\nwas teleport you to various places in your memory, stimulating your\r\nGalactic personality each time, and hope that eventually you would lead\r\nus to the ship."\r\n\r\n"Which," said Shalimar, "I did."\r\n\r\n"Which you did," agreed Mr. 7. "Are we ready, then, to take off,\r\nCaptain?"\r\n\r\n"We are ready, Lieutenant," said Shalimar Smith, otherwise--Mr. Zero.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
