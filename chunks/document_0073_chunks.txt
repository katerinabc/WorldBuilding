At one million, a\r\nscarred and evil leer. Outside the smoking circle our landing-jets had\r\nsterilized, it was a hideous veil of hairy black tentacles and huge\r\nsallow blooms, hiding the riddle of its sinister genes.\r\n\r\nOn most worlds that we astronauts have found, the life is vaguely like\r\nour own. Similar nucleotides are linked along similar helical chains of\r\nDNA, carrying similar genetic messages. A similar process replicates\r\nthe chains when the cells divide, to carry the complex blue-prints for\r\na particular root or eye or wing accurately down across ten thousand\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nBut even the genes were different here--enormously complicated. Here\r\nthe simplest-seeming weed had more and longer chains of DNA than\r\nanything we had seen before. What was their message?\r\n\r\nWe had come to read it, with our new genetic micro-probe. A hundred\r\nprecious tons of microscopic electronic gear, it was designed to\r\nobserve and manipulate the smallest units of life. It could reach even\r\nthose strange genes.\r\n\r\nThat was our mission.\r\n\r\nOurs was the seventh survey ship to approach the planet. Six before us\r\nhad been lost without trace. We were to find out why.\r\n\r\nOur pilot was Lance Llandark. A lean hard man, silent and cold as the\r\ngray-cased micro-probe. We hated him--until someone learned why he had\r\nvolunteered to come.\r\n\r\nHis wife had been pilot of the ship before us. When we knew that, we\r\nbegan to hear the hidden tension in his tired voice, monotonously\r\ncalling on every band: "Come in, Six.... Come in Six...."\r\n\r\nSix never came in.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor two days, we watched the planet. The shallow ditch our jets had\r\ndug. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
The charred stumps. The jungle beyond--the visible mask of those\r\nmonstrous genes--rank, dark, utterly alien.\r\n\r\nAt the third dawn, Lance Llandark took two of us out in a \'copter.\r\nFlying a grid over the landing area, we mapped six shallow pock-marks\r\non that scowling wilderness, where our ships must have landed.\r\n\r\nWe dropped into the newest crater, where black stumps jutted like\r\nbroken teeth out of queerly bare red muck. A yellow-scummed stream\r\noozed across it. By the stream we found a fine-boned human skeleton.\r\n\r\nA nightmare plant stood guard beside the bones. Its thick leaves were\r\nstrangely streaked, twisted with vegetable agony, half poison spine and\r\nhalf blighted bloom. Shapeless blobs of rotting fruit were falling from\r\nit over those slender bones.\r\n\r\nLance Llandark stood up.\r\n\r\n"Her turquoise thunderbird." He showed us the bit of blackened silver\r\nand blue-veined stone. "Back on Terra.... Back when we were student\r\npilots.... We bought it from an Indian in an old, old town called Sante\r\nFe."\r\n\r\nHe bent again.\r\n\r\n"Lilith?" 

=== Chunk 3 ===
he whispered. "Lilith, what killed you?"\r\n\r\nWe found no other bones, nothing even to tell us what force or poison\r\nkept the creeping jungle back from that solitary plant. We left at\r\ndusk. Tenderly, Lance Llandark brought the gathered bones. Carefully we\r\ncarried a few leaves and dried pods from that crazy sentinel plant. We\r\nfound no other clue.\r\n\r\nPatiently, day by forty-hour day, we searched the other sites. We found\r\njet marks and stumps and teeming weeds, but nothing like that tormented\r\nnightmare over Lilith Llandark\'s skeleton. We found no wreckage.\r\nNothing to show how the planet had murdered the lost expeditions.\r\n\r\nDay by eternal day, the unknown leered from the secret places of its\r\ngenes. It was all vegetable. We saw no animal movement, heard no cry or\r\ninsect hum. The silence became suffocating.\r\n\r\nDay after desperate day, we returned to the micro-probe.\r\n\r\n"The answer\'s in the genes," Lance Llandark whispered grimly. "We\'ve no\r\nother chance."\r\n\r\nHe kept the probe running on the strangest genes of all; those from the\r\nplant nightmare that had grown beside his wife. They were like nothing\r\nelse on the planet. The double-stranded chains of DNA were monstrously\r\nlong; many of the nucleotide links held copper or arsenic atoms.\r\n\r\n"Queer!" Lance kept muttering. "No copper or arsenic in other plants\r\nhere. I\'d like to know why."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe was running when we heard the woman scream. In that stifling quiet,\r\nher cry unnerved us all. We crowded down to the lock.\r\n\r\nTattered, stained with blood-colored juices, she slipped through those\r\ncoiled, constricting creepers. She splashed out into the open ditch,\r\nwaving a filthy rag. Halfway to the ship, she fell into the mud.\r\n\r\nLance Llandark led three of us to bring her in. She whimpered and\r\nlooked up. Tears streaked the grime on her wasted face.\r\n\r\n"Lance!" she gasped. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
"My dear."\r\n\r\n"Lilith--" But he shrank back suddenly. "I found Lilith dead!"\r\n\r\n"I am nearly dead." She tried weakly to get up. "You see, we\'re all\r\nmarooned out there in the bush. Emergency landing, when we tried to get\r\noff. Wrecked our astrogation gear. Need your spare astro-pilot--"\r\n\r\n"Back." He swung on us. "Back aboard!

=== Chunk 5 ===
"\r\n\r\n"What\'s wrong?" We were stunned, "She\'s your wife--"\r\n\r\n"Aboard! Instanter!"\r\n\r\nWe obeyed his deadly voice.\r\n\r\n"Help--" she whispered faintly behind us in the mud. "Survivors--need\r\nastro-pilot-to plot our way home--"\r\n\r\nThe clanging lock cut off her voice.\r\n\r\nAngrily we turned on Lance Llandark.\r\n\r\n"Hold it!" he snapped. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
"I\'m not crazy--the planet is. Come along to the\r\nmicro-probe. I\'m probing a seed from the plant we found by Lilith\'s\r\nbones. It puzzled me. So much of it was--"\r\n\r\nIn spite of the tension, he had to grope for a word to express meaning.\r\n\r\n"Arbitrary! Those shapeless leaves, twisted stalk, that sterile seed.\r\nThe copper and arsenic in those needless links. Too many genes had no\r\nfunction. No use at all!\r\n\r\n"I\'d just got the key, when that thing screamed. The copper and arsenic\r\natoms are not genetic instructions to the plant. They\'re a message to\r\nus--words replicated a trillion times, and concealed in every cell of\r\nthe plant!"\r\n\r\n"Words?" someone whispered blankly. "Words in the atoms?"\r\n\r\n"Written in binary code." His scowl was bleakly triumphant. "That\r\nweed\'s a mutant, you see. The real Lilith formed the first cell with\r\nher micro-probe. She left it--I suppose in her own body--as a message\r\nthat no pseudo-Lilith could intercept."\r\n\r\nOutside that something screamed again.\r\n\r\n"Call each copper atom a dot," he whispered. "Call each arsenic a dash.\r\nTaken in order along the chains of DNA, they do encode a message. The\r\ncomputer\'s decoding it now."\r\n\r\nHe punched a button, and the printer whirred.\r\n\r\nTO WHOEVER COMES.... GIVE NO AID TO ANYONE.... GET OFF THIS PLANET....\r\nITS LIFE IS PSEUDOMORPHIC.... DON\'T LET IT LEAVE.... JUST TAKE MY\r\nLOVE TO LANCE LLANDARK.... FROM LILITH, HIS WIFE.... AND GET OFF THIS\r\nPLANET, FAST....\r\n\r\nOutside, it uttered a frantic, bubbling screech.\r\n\r\nWe did get off the planet, and we expect to stay away.\r\n\r\nEND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
