Far down the canyon\r\nstreets a few motor cars still ran and over the swinging aerial bridges\r\nscattered pedestrians carefully wended their way. Their grotesque\r\nfigures with the heavy metal helmets that reminded the watching man\r\nof the half-mythical sea monsters of the past or divers that used to\r\nexplore wrecks were far different from the jostling crowds that had\r\ncrowded the ways only a few short days ago. But that was before the\r\nplague--the plague of the whispering death.\r\n\r\nJohn Cortland, United Utilities Power magnate, sighed as he turned\r\nfrom the quiet streets below. Somberly he regarded a tiny light beam\r\nthat came from the mirror of a galvanometer that trembled and danced\r\ncontinually. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
He mused over the events of the past few days and wondered\r\nat their meaning. Like a caged tiger he paced the metal lined room\r\nwaiting for the word that would spell success or disaster. Five days\r\nbefore it had first appeared. A whispering, a singing and vibrating had\r\nmanifested itself. It was not local but appeared simultaneously all\r\nover the earth. This whispering, as of elfish voices, was not annoying\r\nat first; but it changed and alternated from a shrill whine back to the\r\neery murmuring that was first noticed. Young Cavendish at the Black\r\nLaboratories had first tracked down the cause of the strange sounds--as\r\nto its ultimate origin, that was still veiled in mystery.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the first day people had become nervous, at the end\r\nof the second many were on the point of breaking, and then mankind\r\nbegan to go insane. It was too much for their nervous systems and the\r\nvibration seemed to affect the inner ear. Suddenly a well ordered\r\nplanet became a center of bedlam and chaos. Order could not be restored\r\nbecause there was no one to handle affairs. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
If Dr. Hankins had not\r\ndiscovered that iron would shield a wearer from the vibrations, mankind\r\nwould have been doomed. As it was only a few of the earth\'s heavy\r\npopulation had been able to get the protecting helmets, and some had\r\nlived in metal lined rooms. This discovery of the shielding effect of\r\niron led to the discovery that an electro-magnetic radiation between\r\ninfra-red and the short radio waves was acting on the ozone molecules\r\nto set them into vibration. To cap it all the ionized Heavyside Layer\r\nthat protected the earth from the ultra-violet rays from the sun\r\nwas decomposing also. Thus to the plague of the Whispering Death was\r\nadded the threat of sun burn--a horrible burn that killed the skin and\r\nultimately the patient.\r\n\r\nSavagely John Cortland kicked at his chair as he paced across the\r\nroom. There was one slender hope, a tiny thread that might save them\r\nat last. Europe was prostrated, Asia in turmoil, and America in chaos.\r\nAll depended on the theory that the origin of the destructive vibration\r\nthat had set their ozone molecules into their dance of death had\r\nintelligence back of it. The source of the radiation could not be found\r\nat this time, but that was not needed. If they could use the incoming\r\nradiation field as a carrier and heterodyne on it a super-imposed\r\nvibration perhaps the source could be destroyed. Japan had furnished\r\nthe formula for the opposing field, and United Utilities Power the\r\nenergy. All the great power stations on the planet had been connected\r\nup into a unit, all the tremendous kilowatts of energy had been flowing\r\nfor hours into those great reservoirs of bound energy, the artificial\r\nspace field invented by Minski of Stalingrad; and the great glass\r\nglobes at Schenectady had taken this power and had built up a voltage\r\nunthinkable. The earth was going to hurl the thunderbolts of Jove.\r\n\r\nFor hours now he had restlessly awaited the signal to release this\r\nenergy in answer to the Whispering Death. For hours the stunned planet\r\nhad awaited the moment of decision. When he would release all this pent\r\nup energy that Niagara, Victoria, and countless other water falls and\r\nmany great steam power plants that had been harnessed for man\'s use,\r\nthe carefully pre-calculated voltage would hurl an electron stream\r\nat a target, the desired wave length would be omitted by the target,\r\nand would automatically heterodyne itself on the invading field. This\r\nfrightful stream of energy would blast its generators into atoms, but\r\nit must suffice. It was earth\'s dying stroke.\r\n\r\nA bell tinkled and eagerly John Cortland rushed to answer. A quiet\r\nvoice said.\r\n\r\n"We are ready. The potential has reached maximum."\r\n\r\nThe zero hour had arrived. Nervously John Cortland looked around the\r\nroom, at the familiar articles, and once out the window at the sunlight\r\nand then back in.\r\n\r\nHe threw the switch.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPhor, great leader of the once powerful Murians, gazed through the\r\nmatter shield across space to the planet hanging in the heavens. A\r\ngreat green disk outlined in pearly light with green continents and\r\nbluish-green seas pointed clearly to its nearness. The artificial\r\nsatellite that housed the observatory was circling this planet with\r\nincredible velocity. This was just what they had been looking for, an\r\nhabitable planet with intelligent beings on it to aid them in their\r\nproblems. Long ages ago they had left their planet just before their\r\nsun had become a nova and had exploded. Only a few of their peoples\r\nhad been saved and at the thought the great goggle eyes filmed in\r\nsorrow. The great journey through space had tried them all, generations\r\nhad been born and some had died. By necessity they had kept their\r\npopulation down until they could come to a system which might support\r\nthem. They not only needed a habitable planet but an intelligent people\r\non this planet so that they could rebuild their civilization quickly.\r\nThey were friendly and had no wish to harm the dwellers on this planet.\r\n\r\nHe did not entirely agree with the council that they should get into\r\ncommunication with these peoples before landing. Phor thought they\r\nwere wasting time to encircle this beautiful world while attempting\r\nto communicate with them. Their atmosphere analysis had shown them\r\nsmall quantities of ozone and they were bombarding the ozone with\r\na controlled radiation. This caused them to act as receivers and\r\nconverters so that intelligent communication could be set up. It was\r\njust like a radio without a receiving set. The ozone molecules did\r\nit all just before decomposing. To one side he could see the huge\r\ntransformers and generators of the tiny moonlet\'s driving plant and\r\nray generators. The actual projector hung like a huge mushroom some\r\ndistance from the generating plant. The inclined buildings, due to the\r\nhigh radius of curvature of the moonlet, looked as if they were falling\r\ndown all the time. Tiny figures of Murians ceaselessly worked about the\r\ngreat machines that had cared for them for ages.\r\n\r\nFor days now they had been keeping up the barrage, hoping to get a\r\nresponse. Their electro-telescopes had shown them that this planet\r\nhoused a people as intelligent as their own. Their great cities,\r\nships, and power stations made them long to be with the planet\'s\r\npeoples. Together they could do wonders and here they were waiting\r\nin space. Why this waste of time? Of course the Council was right in\r\nbelieving that the sudden appearance of unfamiliar beings might start\r\nan interplanetary war, and they could not fight a war. Their resources\r\nwere practically exhausted, their peoples few, and they had no desire\r\nto cause trouble. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
They only wanted peace and a place to live. He\r\nshrugged his scaly shoulders and cocked his vertical eye at the meters\r\ncovering the walls. No response to their messages yet. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
What could be\r\nthe matter? Of course the planet had a denser atmosphere than that they\r\nhad been accustomed to, but no matter. They could adjust themselves to\r\nit. Strange about the messages though. They had been exactly within the\r\naudibility range of the Murians and their antennae had no difficulty in\r\nreading them. Of course the planet\'s men would receive them just the\r\nsame. Still the prediction of Tum-tak that the denser atmosphere would\r\nincrease the pitch of the ozone molecules had to be considered. However\r\nthis increased pitch should not harm the inhabitants. Their antennae\r\nreceived them very well tests demonstrated. They had not tested them\r\nfor an effect on an inner ear structure, for they had never possessed\r\nthem. Their sound transmission had been direct.\r\n\r\nIf they did not get a response within a few more revolutions about the\r\nplanet they would be compelled to go down into the atmosphere. Wonder\r\nwhat that unusual activity about the power plants and the great crystal\r\nglobes on one of the major continents meant anyway? Perhaps they were\r\npreparing to answer their calls. But why so much power as they seemed\r\nto be accumulating? What a peculiar field! That was unknown to them.\r\nWhy these peoples had pumped more power into that one field than the\r\nMurians had developed for ages. Great peoples these inhabitants of the\r\nthird planet. Well, he would take one more glance at the great crystal\r\nglobes before turning over his place to his aide. There it was now.\r\nThe crystal globes were surrounded in crimson flame, they disappeared\r\nin blinding incandescence, and horrors, simultaneously their projector\r\nhad been surrounded by a halo of radiation that arced across to the\r\ngenerators. These exploded showering molten metal on the frightened\r\nMurians. Phor did not see the full charge arrive, blasting the moonlet\r\ninto incandescence and destroying the last of the Murians.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "_The generators exploded showering molten metal on the\r\nfrightened Murians._"]\r\n\r\nA great flare came into being in space between earth and moon. The\r\nearthlings were greatly mystified at it, but the Whispering Death had\r\nceased. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
They were satisfied.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
