]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                They didn\'t have to worry about a thing\r\n                for the rest of their natural lives....\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Ypsilanti swung at the door with the steak cuber. Or was it\r\nthe cube steaker? No matter. The door was a good, hardwood door and\r\nresisted his onslaught well. But time was on his side.\r\n\r\nHe had the energy and the time, he knew, and sooner or later the door\r\nwould be kindling.\r\n\r\nIt was the door to his room. It was evident to him that he did not need\r\nthe door to his room and that he _did_ need heat. In fact he had better\r\nget some heat pretty soon--although he was keeping warm enough for the\r\npresent by beating on the door. So he would beat this door to kindling,\r\nand then he would build a nice, cozy fire in the hall that would keep\r\nhim warm for a long time ... if he was stingy with his fuel.\r\n\r\nThe carpenter came by. The carpenter was always coming by, except when\r\nyou wanted him, Jim realized. The carpenter was a mighty, mighty busy\r\nfellow.\r\n\r\nThe carpenter stopped short when he saw Jim demolishing the door. In\r\nfact he came to a grinding halt.\r\n\r\n"Jim, why didn\'t you tell me!"\r\n\r\n"Carpenter, how was I to know where you were? Who can ever find you?"\r\n\r\n"I know Jim. Jim, you work so hard!"\r\n\r\n"Yes!" he said, pounding.\r\n\r\n"Take this hatchet, Jim. A hatchet is what you demolish doors with!\r\nGood-by." The carpenter departed.\r\n\r\nJames Ypsilanti swung on the door with his newly acquired hatchet. Soon\r\nhe was ready for his fire. He struck a match, and in no time had the\r\npile of varnished kindling blazing smokily in the hall. He held his\r\nhands over the blaze.\r\n\r\n"Ah, good, good. Good." He closed his eyes. "What could be better than\r\nthis?" Then he opened them again regretfully. "It\'s dinner time. I\'d\r\nbetter fix it while I have my fire going." He hurried to the kitchen\r\nand chose a can of eggs-bacon-and-pancakes from the massive stores.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOpening the large can, he heated it over his hall fire. Then he dumped\r\nthe contents on his tin plate and ate.\r\n\r\n"Murder," he thought somberly. "That\'s what I\'m in for.

Practically\r\nmurder with consent. She said she couldn\'t live without me. Margie\r\nbegged me to kill her, you might as well say. Good old Margie; a good\r\nkid, but I killed her. And now.... Well, that\'s life!" He speared a\r\npancake.\r\n\r\n"Damn, but it\'s _cold_!" He threw an armload of wood on the fire and it\r\nblazed up. "Sure wish these carpenters had feelings. My lord, they got\r\nno feelings at all!"\r\n\r\nThe carpenter arrived with a new hardwood door. Whistling cheerily, he\r\nbegan to install it where the other one had just been hatcheted away.\r\n\r\n"Carpenter, that door won\'t be staying there long. I\'m almost out of\r\nfuel."\r\n\r\n"I hope you don\'t expect me to be surprised, Jim, if this door doesn\'t\r\nlast very long. The previous twenty-two doors at this location,\r\nJim, did not last very long either." Still whistling to himself, he\r\ninstalled the last of the hinge screws.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you just _give_ me the doors, instead of causing yourself\r\nall this work?" demanded James Ypsilanti.\r\n\r\n"\'Inmates will not be issued materials,\' Jim. I\'ve quoted that section\r\nof the rules to you many times, Jim."\r\n\r\n"But couldn\'t you just _lean_ the door up against the door jamb and\r\nleave it?" argued the inmate. "You go to a ridiculous amount of\r\ntrouble."\r\n\r\n"It is not ridiculous, Jim. I am a carpenter, Jim.

Good-by."\r\n\r\nAfter lunch, James Ypsilanti crawled into his escape tunnel.\r\n\r\nHe liked to go in there every day and daydream. The tunnel ended\r\nabortively at the wall of the prison, for the prison wall extended down\r\ninto solid bed rock for a meter, and it was fabricated of one-meter\r\nthick compressed steel. It was the nearest thing to an exit that the\r\nprison had.\r\n\r\nOfficials had always come and gone through the massive, englobing wall\r\nby matter transmitters. "Smarties couldn\'t find me though, when I was\r\nin my escape tunnel," he chortled, as he stretched out in the cave\r\nunder the concrete. "They can walk through walls, but they couldn\'t\r\nfind _me_." Then his tone became baleful. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
"The smarties\'ll never find\r\nme."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs James Ypsilanti chopped on the door next day, the carpenter stood\r\ncheerily watching.\r\n\r\n"Carpenter, why don\'t you fix the damn heating plant? Then I wouldn\'t\r\nhave to be chopping up your doors all the time to keep warm."\r\n\r\n"I am a carpenter, Jim, not a heat-plant fixer, as you well know from\r\nour previous negotiations on the subject."\r\n\r\n"What will you do, carpenter, when I have used up all your doors?" the\r\nconvict jibed.\r\n\r\n"Why, Jim, we will have to send out for some more," the carpenter\r\nanswered condescendingly.\r\n\r\n"Still, I wish you would let _me_ work on that heat plant," urged\r\nYpsilanti. "I might fix it."\r\n\r\n"\'Inmates will not be permitted to disassemble or otherwise interfere\r\nwith the machinery of the institution,\'" quoted the carpenter. "Need I\r\nsay more, Jim?"\r\n\r\n"Okay," said James Ypsilanti, resuming his destructive work on the new\r\ndoor. "Scram, stupid." The carpenter departed.\r\n\r\n"That dope," Jim said between blows, "is even foggier in the head than\r\nmy lousy lawyer was, and that\'s going some."\r\n\r\n"Jim," said the carpenter, returning and sounding very pleased with\r\nhimself, "look here at what I have found, Jim."\r\n\r\nJames Ypsilanti turned to look at what the carpenter held in his hand.\r\nIt was a carpenter\'s square sheathed in plastic.\r\n\r\n"Found enough of them to last me a lifetime, Jim," said the carpenter\r\ncomplacently. "I\'ll never have to buy any."\r\n\r\n"No, you won\'t," agreed James Ypsilanti bitterly. "Can\'t you get it\r\ninto your head that you and I are the only ones left on Earth? After\r\nthe war the rest left. They couldn\'t _find_ us when they evacuated this\r\natomic-explosion wrecked planet, because we were in this escape-proof\r\njug. So they went away and _left_ us!

"\r\n\r\n"I know, Jim."\r\n\r\nYpsilanti studied the mobile features of the carpenter, searching\r\nintently for a sign.\r\n\r\nBut the carpenter robot strolled away, whistling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
