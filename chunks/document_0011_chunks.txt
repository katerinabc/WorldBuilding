Logan is one of the more interesting of the newer\r\n    writers._\r\n\r\n\r\nmex\r\n\r\n_by ... WILLIAM LOGAN_\r\n\r\n\r\n Perhaps it was just as well that I\r\n did not tell them what I was....\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat they called me, that was what started it. I\'m as good an American\r\nas the next fellow, and maybe a little bit better than men like that,\r\nbig men drinking in a bar who can\'t find anything better to do than to\r\nspit on a man and call him Mex. As if a Mexican is something to hide or\r\nto be ashamed of. We have our own heroes and our own strength and we\r\ndon\'t have to bend down to men like that, or any other men. But when\r\nthey called me that I saw red and called them names back.\r\n\r\n"Mex kid," one of the men said, a big red-haired bully with his sleeves\r\nrolled back and muscles like ropes on the big hairy arms. "Snot-nosed\r\nlittle Mex brat."\r\n\r\nI called him a name.

He only laughed back at me and turned his back,\r\nwaving a hand for the bartender. Maybe in a big city in the North it\r\nwould be different and probably it would not: this toleration we hear\r\nabout is no more good than an open fight, and there must be\r\nunderstanding instead. But here near the border, just on the American\r\nside of the border, a Mexican is called fair game, and a\r\nseventeen-year-old like me is less than nothing to them, to the white\r\nones who go to the big bars.\r\n\r\nI thought carefully about what to do, and finally when I had made my\r\nmind up I went for him and tried to hit him. But other men held me back,\r\nand I was kicking and shouting with my legs off the ground.

When I\r\nstopped they put me down, so I started for the big red-haired man again\r\nand they had to stop me again. The red-haired man was laughing all this\r\ntime. I wanted to run, back to my own family in their little house, and\r\nyet running would have been wrong; I was too angry to run, so I stayed.\r\n\r\n"My sister," I said. "My sister is a witch and I will get her to put a\r\ncurse on you." I was very angry, you must understand this.\r\n\r\nAnd of course they had no idea that my sister is a real witch, and her\r\ncurses are real, and only last year Manuel Valdez had died from the\r\neffects of her curse. Of all people, sometimes I wish I were my sister\r\nmost of all, to curse people and see them shrivel and sicken and choke\r\nand die.\r\n\r\n"Go ahead, half-pint," one of the other men yelled. "Get your sister to\r\nput a curse on me. I bet she knows who I am; I been with every Mex girl\r\nthis side of the border."\r\n\r\nThis made me see red; my sister is pure and must be pure, since she is a\r\nwitch. And she is not like some of the others even aside from that. I\r\nhave heard her talk about them and I know.\r\n\r\nI called him a name and ran up to him and hit him; my fist against his\r\nsolid side felt good, but some other men pulled me off again. Yet it was\r\nimpossible to leave. This was wrong for me, and I had to make it right.\r\n"I shall get my father to fight you, since he is a giant ten feet tall."\r\n\r\nThe men laughed at me, not knowing, of course, that my father is a giant\r\nten feet tall in truth, and my mother a sweet siren like those in the\r\nbooks, the old books, with spells in her eyes and a strange power. They\r\ndid not know I was not a daydreaming child but a man who told truth.\r\n\r\nAnd they laughed; I grew angry again and told them many things, calling\r\nthem names in Spanish, which they did not understand. That only made\r\nthem laugh the more.\r\n\r\nFinally I left; it was necessary for me to leave, since I was not\r\nwanted. But it was necessary, too, for me to make things right. Nights\r\nlater they were dead for what they had said and done.\r\n\r\nFor I tell the truth always, and I had told them about my sister and my\r\nfather and my mother. But one thing I had not told them.\r\n\r\nI am sorry they could never know I was the winged thing that frightened\r\nand killed them, one by one....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ January 1957.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.
