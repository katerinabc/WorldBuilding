He was willing to\r\n     scream his head off for it!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQUIET PLEASE\r\n\r\nBy KEVIN SCOTT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe big man eased the piano off his back and stood looking at Groverzb.\r\n\r\n"You ain\'t gonna like it here." He mopped his face. "Boy, will I ever be\r\nglad to get off this cockeyed planet."\r\n\r\nGroverzb pushed at his spectacles, sniffed, and said, "Quite."\r\n\r\nThe big man said, "Ain\'t no native here over three feet tall. And they\r\ngot some crazy kind of communication. They don\'t talk."\r\n\r\nGroverzb said, "Quiet."\r\n\r\n"Uh?"\r\n\r\n"Precisely why I am here. I," said Groverzb, sniffing again, "loathe\r\nconversation."\r\n\r\n"Oh. Well." He left.\r\n\r\nAlone, Groverzb surveyed his realm. The house was the shell of what had\r\nformerly been a Little People apartment building. Ceilings, floors and\r\nwalls had been removed to form one large room. The tiny doors and\r\nwindows had been sealed, and a single window and door had been cut into\r\nthe shell for Groverzb\'s use. Crude, but serviceable.\r\n\r\nGroverzb walked to the window and looked down the slope. Little People\r\nbuildings dotted the landscape, and the people themselves scurried\r\nsilently about. Yes, thought Groverzb, it would do nicely. He had\r\nbrought an adequate food-tablet supply. He would finish, without the\r\ndistraction of voices, his beautiful concerto. He would return to Earth\r\nfamous and happy.\r\n\r\nArmed with paper and pencils, he went to the piano, having decided to\r\nenlarge upon the theme in the second movement. His mind knew exactly how\r\nthe passage should run, and he swiftly covered the paper with sharp,\r\nangular notes. Then he triumphantly lifted his hands and began to play\r\nwhat he had written.\r\n\r\nHe jerked back from the keyboard, his hair on end, his teeth, on edge,\r\nhis ears screaming with the mass of sounds he had produced. He looked at\r\nhis hands, peered at the score, adjusted his spectacles and tried again.\r\n\r\nI\'m tired, he thought, recoiling in horror from the racket. A food\r\ntablet and a nap will remedy the situation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke, Groverzb walked to the window, refreshed. A violet glow\r\nhad replaced the harsh yellow light of day. At the foot of the slope,\r\nthe Little People dashed to and fro, but no voice broke the peaceful\r\nquiet of the evening.\r\n\r\nWith a sigh of satisfaction, Groverzb went to the piano. Gently, he\r\nstruck the keys. Blatant, jumbled noise filled the room.\r\n\r\nBreathing hard, Groverzb rose and gingerly lifted the spinet\'s lid. No,\r\nnothing amiss there. Good felts, free hammers, solid sounding\r\nboard--must be out of tune.\r\n\r\nGroverzb closed the lid, sat down and struck a single note. A clear\r\ntone sang out. He moved chromatically up and down the scale. Definitely\r\nnot out of tune.\r\n\r\nHe shifted the score, glanced uneasily at the keys and began to play.\r\nDiscord immediately pierced his eardrums.\r\n\r\nHe clapped his hands over his ears and leaped wildly from the piano\r\nbench. The trip, he decided frantically. It must have affected my\r\nhearing.\r\n\r\nHe flung himself from the house and down the slope. The Little People\r\nscattered, staring. He charged into the administration building and\r\nclutched the lapels of a uniformed official.\r\n\r\n"A doctor!" he gasped.

"Now! 

=== Chunk 3 ===
This minute!"\r\n\r\nThe official raised his eyebrows and removed Groverzb\'s hands with\r\ndistaste.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a little late in the day," he drawled, "but maybe the doc up on\r\nthe top floor--"\r\n\r\nGroverzb flew up the stairs and into the doctor\'s office. The doctor\'s\r\nface lit up.\r\n\r\n"A patient!" he exclaimed. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
"Capital! What seems to be the trouble? Food\r\npoisoning? Shouldn\'t eat the food here. Garbage. Appendix? Heart\r\nattack?"\r\n\r\n"Stop talking, you idiot, it\'s my ears!"\r\n\r\nObviously disappointed, the doctor nevertheless poked and peered at\r\nGroverzb\'s ears.\r\n\r\n"No," he said finally. "A trifle big, yes. But nothing wrong with them."\r\n\r\n"You\'re sure?"\r\n\r\n"Absolutely. A pity. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
I\'m getting a bit rusty."\r\n\r\nWith a groan, Groverzb staggered out of the building, back through town,\r\nand up the slope to his house. Seating himself firmly on the bench he\r\nbegan to play.\r\n\r\nHe shuddered. The noise was abominable.\r\n\r\nSuddenly his door burst open and a crowd of Little People rushed in.\r\nThey pulled him off the bench and slapped angrily at his hands. Then,\r\nwith cutters, they attacked the piano.\r\n\r\n"Here, stop that!" Groverzb screeched. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
"What do you think you\'re doing?"\r\n\r\nThe Little People pushed and dragged him out of the house, down the\r\nslope, through the town and into the launching bowl at the space-strip.\r\nThe launching agent took one look and yelled, "Get the interpreter! On\r\nthe double!"\r\n\r\nThe interpreter ran up and whipped something from his pocket. It looked\r\nlike a miniature piano skeleton. He tripped a hammer. There was a faint\r\ntinkle. Instantly one of the Little People produced a single miniature\r\nhammer and tapped it rapidly against his skull. The interpreter tripped\r\nanother hammer. A second little one responded.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuddenly one of the Little People ran over and tripped all the\r\ninterpreter\'s hammers simultaneously. The Little People winced.\r\n\r\n"Oh," said the interpreter. "Well, it\'s their planet." He hustled\r\nGroverzb out to a freight ship that was warming up for takeoff.\r\n\r\n"Is everyone insane?" Groverzb croaked. "I demand to know what this is\r\nall about!"\r\n\r\nThe interpreter shoved Groverzb into the ship.\r\n\r\n"They say you talk too much!" he yelled, as he slammed the door.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
