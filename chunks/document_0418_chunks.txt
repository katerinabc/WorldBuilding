Even in the old days\r\ngrocers were always finding twenty-foot pythons curled cozily inside\r\nbunches of bananas from South America; and what sort of undesired\r\nstowaways do you suppose you get when you have a cargo of tongarus\r\nfrom south Venus, agatized Fyella corymbs from the district around\r\nAphrodition, hand-painted lumigraphs on goor fiber made in Marsport\r\nprefecture, and golden rhnx jewelry from the canal centers?\r\n\r\nGeorge Saunders, supercargo of the _S.S. Trito_, gave his wife a warm\r\nkiss on the cheek.\r\n\r\n"For Pete\'s sake," he hissed into her ear, "act like you\'re glad to see\r\nme, can\'t you? The Old Man\'s watching us."\r\n\r\nMarta Saunders hesitated a moment and then threw her plump body into\r\nher husband\'s arms.\r\n\r\n"Oooh, Georgie!" she squealed. "You sweet old thing! It\'s so wonderful\r\nto see you again!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s enough," George rumbled warningly. He was swaying a little from\r\nthe impact. "Don\'t want to overdo it. 

=== Chunk 2 ===
Let\'s get out of here."\r\n\r\nThey started over to the parking area of the spaceport, where their\r\n\'copter was.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter?" Marta demanded as soon as they were out of earshot\r\nof the ship. "What do you care what the captain thinks about us?"\r\n\r\n"Listen, Marta, the old fool\'s been riding me ever since we left\r\nAphrodition. Says I\'m the most incompetent supercargo he\'s ever had.\r\nJust before we docked today, he said he thought he\'d take it up with\r\nthe union. If he does, you know what\'ll happen. Pynx said the last time\r\nthat if he got one more complaint about me he\'d take the case to the\r\nexecutive board. I\'d lose my license, sure."\r\n\r\n"Oh." Marta seemed unwillingly impressed. She got an atomizer out of\r\nher handcase and began spraying quick-drying cosmi-lac over the skin of\r\nher face and neck. "But what happened?" she asked an instant later when\r\nthe cosmetic had set. "Why\'s he so down on you?"\r\n\r\nFor a moment the fine-etched lines of irritation and petulance faded\r\nfrom George Saunders\' face, to be replaced by an expression of honest\r\nperplexity.\r\n\r\n"Marta, I--wait, here\'s the \'copter. I\'ll tell you about it after we\r\nget in. And for the love of heaven, don\'t drop any pop bottles out of\r\nthe window the way you did the last time I was in port. Having the\r\nair police after us would be the last straw, as far as my nerves are\r\nconcerned."\r\n\r\nHe slid into the driver\'s seat. Marta got two bottles of pop out of the\r\nrefrigerator, shoved straws into their necks, pulled a shelf out of the\r\npaneling to hold one bottle at a convenient level under George\'s nose,\r\nand began drinking out of the other herself.\r\n\r\n"Well?" she asked after a couple of swallows.\r\n\r\nGeorge drank from his bottle before replying.\r\n\r\n"It\'s the darnedest thing. I remember beginning to load number two\r\nand three holds at Aphrodition, and I remember telling the longshore\r\nleaderman to have the hatch covers put on again when the holds were\r\nfilled, but there\'re six or eight hours in there during the loading I\r\ndon\'t remember a single thing about. They\'re totally gone.\r\n\r\n"Well, the way the ship handled at the take-off from Aphrodition, the\r\nOld Man thought there must be something wrong, and when we were out in\r\nspace he went in for a look. Wow! I can see, sort of, why he\'s sore.\r\nThose holds look like somebody\'d stirred the things in \'em up with\r\na big stick. About a third of the cargo\'s ruined. The tongarus have\r\nleaked all over those blasted lumigraphs, and--Well, the insurance\r\ncompany is going to raise blue murder, and the owners won\'t like it one\r\nlittle bit."\r\n\r\nGeorge licked his thin lips.\r\n\r\n"What I want to know," he burst out, "is what _happened_ to me? I must\r\nhave told the longshoremen to load the holds like that, but--When we\r\nwere two days out of Venus, I asked Sparks (he\'s had a pre-medical\r\ncourse, and he\'s saving up the tuition for medical school) to look me\r\nover. He gave me all the tests, dozens of them, and finally told me\r\nthere wasn\'t a thing wrong with me mentally or physically except that I\r\nneeded more rest. Rest, bushwah! I\'ve been sleeping ten hours a night,\r\nand I wake up tireder than when I went to bed."\r\n\r\nMarta studied him.\r\n\r\n"You do look sort of tired," she observed. "Maybe you need some\r\nvitor-ray treatments."\r\n\r\nGeorge ignored this comment.\r\n\r\n"Of course, the Old Man\'s not such a bad guy," he said. "He never said\r\nanything about that time I missed the ship at Marsport."\r\n\r\n"You mean that time you were so drunk on soma? One of the times.

=== Chunk 3 ===
"\r\n\r\nGeorge gave an irritated shrug.\r\n\r\n"Never mind that," he snapped. "I mentioned it because I asked him to\r\nhave dinner with us on Thursday, the day before we sail, and I want\r\nyou to have a real old-fashioned home-cooked meal for him. Maybe I can\r\nsoften him up. Have something nice for him. None of this complete meal\r\nstuff out of the freezer--have something good. Out of cans."\r\n\r\n"You mean like my canned crab and mushroom casserole?"\r\n\r\n"Um-hum. Have that. And what\'s that dessert you make with the canned\r\npeaches and the soma? p\xc3\xaache flamb\xc3\xa9e, or something. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
He might like that."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGeorge set the \'copter down neatly on the roof of their apartment\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n"Remember," he said, "I\'ve got to make a good impression on him.\r\nFlatter him as much as you can, but use your head about it. And if you\r\nget any kind of a chance to tell him about how reliable I usually am,\r\ndo it.

=== Chunk 5 ===
"\r\n\r\nThe days moved on toward Thursday. George continued to complain of\r\nfatigue, and on Tuesday night Marta woke up shrieking with a vague\r\nand horrible nightmare, but it was attributed to indigestion; after\r\na dose of antiacid, she went back to sleep. On Wednesday she had her\r\nhallucination.\r\n\r\nShe was putting a bunch of old digests and tabloids away in the closet\r\nin the living room when she came across the jacket George had used four\r\nor five years ago when he went grotch hunting.\r\n\r\n"George!" she called. "Oh, George! Can I throw your old gray jacket\r\naway? It\'s full of moth holes."\r\n\r\n"What are you yelling at me for?" George asked irritably from behind\r\nher. He had been sitting in his study, which was only about five feet\r\ndistant from the closet, drinking soma. "I\'m right here."\r\n\r\nMarta came out of the closet and stared at him. One hand went to her\r\nheart. The pallor of her heavy, sagging face showed through her thick\r\nface lacquer as a muddy gray.\r\n\r\n"Wha--I saw you go into the kitchen!" she said. "You were wearing your\r\nbrown suit. I was looking right at you, and you walked the length of\r\nthe living room and went into the kitchen and closed the door behind\r\nyou. That\'s why I yelled at you. You were wearing your brown suit.\r\nYou\'ve got the blue one on now. You were wearing your brown suit!"\r\n\r\n"Shut up!" George said passionately. "Are you trying to drive me crazy?\r\nI\'ve been sitting right here all the time. What do you mean, you saw me\r\nwalk into the kitchen? You couldn\'t have. I\'ve been sitting right here\r\nall the time."\r\n\r\n"But I saw you! You were wearing your brown suit."\r\n\r\n"You imagined it!" her husband shrieked at her. "It\'s your imagination.\r\nYou shut up. What are you trying to do, get me so nervous the Old Man\r\nwill think I\'m ready for the loony bin? You imagined it!

=== Chunk 6 ===
"\r\n\r\nMarta looked at him. She had to lick her lips twice before she could\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n"Yes. Yes, of course. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
That must be it. 

=== Chunk 8 ===
I imagined it."\r\n\r\nGeorge spent the rest of the day drinking soma and holding his hands\r\nup before his eyes to see if they had stopped shaking. Marta got a\r\nfive-suit deck of cards out of the closet and played solitaire. None of\r\nher games came out, but she was too distraught to realize that she had\r\nleft two of the cards inside their box.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, both George and Marta slept well. They awakened far more\r\ncheerful than they had been the night before. Even their pre-breakfast\r\nsnapping at each other lacked its usual note of bitter sincerity. When\r\nMarta left the apartment and started out to do her shopping, she was\r\nhumming under her breath.\r\n\r\nThe canned crab was easy enough to locate, but she had to go to three\r\nstores before she could find the peaches and the mushrooms. She ran\r\nthem to earth at last in a little grocery on a side street. Just as she\r\nwas leaving it, her eye caught the flash of a red label on a low shelf\r\nnear the door and she triumphantly dug out two cans of tomato soup.\r\n\r\n"See what I got!" she said, showing her prize to George when she got\r\nback home. "I guess I\'m lucky or something. It\'s awfully hard to find."\r\n\r\n"Gosh!" George shut off the video to give her his full attention.\r\n"That\'s wonderful. I happen to know the Old Man\'s crazy about it. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
His\r\nmother used to have it all the time. I wouldn\'t be a bit surprised\r\nif it makes him change his mind completely about going to the union.\r\nMarta, you\'re a smart girl."\r\n\r\nMarta spent the rest of the day at the beauty shop, getting her hair\r\nre-garnished with galoons and her face set. She wanted to make the\r\nbest possible impression on the captain. Around five-thirty she began\r\ngetting dinner--it doesn\'t take long to open cans--and an hour or so\r\nlater the Old Man (his name was Kauss) was chiming at the door.\r\n\r\nKauss was definitely stiff at first. He greeted Saunders with resentful\r\nformality and gave Marta the merest flash of a smile before his face\r\ngrew hard again. When the fragrant steam from the tureen of tomato soup\r\nMarta was bringing in blew toward him, he relaxed somewhat, and the\r\nsalad of canned string beans, onions, lettuce and mayonnaise softened\r\nhim still more. By the time he had finished two big helpings of Marta\'s\r\ncrab casserole, it began to look like the job was saved. He offered\r\nGeorge a cigar and began telling him a long story about what the\r\nlittle Martian hostess at the Silver Weetarete had said to him.\r\n\r\nMarta went out in the kitchen to fix the p\xc3\xaache flamb\xc3\xa9e. She cut sponge\r\ncake into neat rounds, spread disks of hard-frozen banana ice cream\r\nover them, and crowned the structure on each dessert plate with half\r\nof an enormous canned clingstone peach. From a bottle she poured soma\r\ncarefully over each of the peaches, set a bit of paper to burning by\r\npressing it against the element in the atomic range, and then used the\r\npaper to ignite the soma on the peaches.\r\n\r\n"George!" she called in the direction of the dining apse. "Oh, George,\r\nhoney, help me with the plates!"\r\n\r\nShe heard him come in. She turned at his step, ready to pick up the\r\nplates, one in each hand, and give them to him.\r\n\r\nHe was wearing his brown suit.\r\n\r\nBut--he was wearing the green one today, wasn\'t he, because it was the\r\nbest suit he had and he wanted to impress the captain. His green--his\r\ngreen--\r\n\r\nGeorge\'s face slipped down toward the fourth button on his coat. It\r\nwavered, solidified, flowed back into place, and then slopped down over\r\nhis lapels once more. Suddenly it solidified into a sort of tentacle.\r\nIt came falteringly toward Marta, half-blind, but purposive.\r\n\r\nMarta tried to scream. Her throat was too constricted by terror to let\r\nout more than a mere thread of sound, but it had carrying power. George\r\nand Kauss, out in the dining apse, heard it.\r\n\r\nThey came running in. Kauss was quick-witted. He picked up one of the\r\nplates with the soma burning on it and hurled it straight at the thing\r\nthat was wearing George\'s clothes.\r\n\r\nThere was an explosion, so loud that the plexiglass in the windows\r\nbulged outward for a moment, and then a bright, instant column of\r\nflame. Then nothing. George\'s brown suit lay collapsed and empty on the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: There was an explosion so loud the plexiglass windows\r\nbulged outward for a moment.]\r\n\r\n"It was wearing your suit, George," Marta said hysterically. She was\r\nleaning back against the wall, looking faint and sick. "George, it was\r\nwearing your suit. Oh, what was it, what was it, anyway?"\r\n\r\nKauss was looking at the debris on the floor. A peculiar expression,\r\nhalf satisfaction, half private insight, hovered around the corners of\r\nhis lips.\r\n\r\n"It was a Mocker, I think," he answered.\r\n\r\n"A Mocker? What--?"\r\n\r\n"Um-hum. You still find a few of them in the wilder parts of Venus.\r\nThey\'re parasitic--ah--entities, that feed on the life force, as well\r\nas the flesh, of human beings. No doubt this one came aboard the\r\nship at Aphrodition, in that consignment of Fyella corymbs. They\'re\r\ninvisible most of the time, so of course we didn\'t suspect it."\r\n\r\n"But how did it get here?" George demanded. "Why did it pick on Marta\r\nas a victim?"\r\n\r\n"Well, you see the usual way a Mocker works is to select someone as\r\na host, as a sort of base of operations, and then range out from him\r\nwhenever it wants to eat. For some reason, whenever it leaves its host,\r\nit takes on his features and body and dresses itself in his clothes.\r\nThat\'s what happened here. One of the first signs that a Mocker is\r\ntaking hold is a spell of amnesia, and of course that\'s what happened\r\nto you, Saunders, when we were taking on cargo at Aphrodition, though I\r\ndidn\'t realize it at the time.\r\n\r\n"A Mocker doesn\'t usually kill its host directly, but it does draw\r\non his life force to keep itself going, and he usually complains of\r\nfeeling worn out and tired."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKauss halted. Marta looked down at her husband\'s brown suit and the ice\r\ncream slowly melting across it.\r\n\r\n"Please, George, pick up that stuff before it ruins your suit\r\ncompletely," she said automatically. And then, to Kauss, "But what\r\nhappened when you threw the plate at it? What happened? 

=== Chunk 10 ===
Oh, I was so\r\nscared!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, the Mockers are terrifying." Kauss agreed. He seemed to square\r\nhis broad shoulders. "However, at bottom they are unintelligent--look\r\nat the stupidity of this one in attacking you when your husband and I\r\nwere in the next room--and they are really not especially dangerous\r\nprovided you know the defense against them.\r\n\r\n"You see, their body structure, while based on the same elements as\r\nour own, involves large quantities of free hydrogen between the body\r\ncells. Hydrogen ignites in ordinary air with explosive force--the end\r\nproduct\'s water--and when I threw that burning stuff at the creature,\r\nthe hydrogen in its tissues exploded. It blew up. There\'s probably\r\na good deal more water vapor in the air in this room than there was\r\nbefore I got rid of the thing."\r\n\r\nKauss cleared his throat.\r\n\r\n"There\'s another life form," he said with a faintly professional air,\r\n"allied to the Mocker, but with important differences, which is far\r\nmore dangerous. That\'s the Stroller."\r\n\r\n"The Stroller?" Marta asked. George had put his arm around her; they\r\nwere not an affectionate couple, but the moment seemed to call for\r\ntender demonstration. "Why do they call it that?

=== Chunk 11 ===
"\r\n\r\n"No one knows, exactly. It seems to come from the creature\'s own name\r\nfor itself, for its fondness for taking long, long, walks."\r\n\r\nKauss turned the cigar in his mouth. He poked at the suit lying on the\r\nfloor with the toe of his shoe.\r\n\r\n"What does _it_ do?" Marta queried. "Why is it so terribly dangerous?"\r\n\r\n"The Stroller doesn\'t hunt a host, like the Mocker," Kauss replied.\r\n"Early in life it takes over the identity of some human being, and it\r\nremains indistinguishable from a human being to any usual test. It\'s\r\nso dangerous because there\'s absolutely no defense against it. No free\r\nhydrogen in _its_ tissues. It\'s indestructible."\r\n\r\n"My!" Marta said. "Goodness!"\r\n\r\n"It feeds, like the Mocker, on both the flesh and the life force of\r\nhuman beings. Fortunately"--Kauss smiled--"it\'s very, very rare. There\r\nare probably only a few Strollers in the entire solar system, and they\r\nreproduce only at widely separated intervals."\r\n\r\nOnce more Kauss halted and poked absently at the clothing on the floor\r\nwith the toe of his boot.\r\n\r\n"There\'s a peculiarity about their feeding habits," he said. "They\'ll\r\ngo for years without feeling any desire to eat their special food, and\r\nthen something will happen which makes them--greedy, and after that\r\nthey can\'t be stopped before they feed."\r\n\r\n"Goodness!" Marta said again. She hid a nervous yawn behind her hand.\r\n"George, get me a chair, will you? I\'d like to sit down." To Kauss, she\r\nsaid. "How did you find out all these things? 

=== Chunk 12 ===
You must have made quite\r\na study of the subject. Why, I\'ve read several books about Venus, and I\r\nlisten to all the casts on the video about it, but I never heard either\r\nof these creatures mentioned before. It seems to be a sort of hobby of\r\nyours."\r\n\r\nGeorge pushed a kitchen chair out for her; she sat down with a sigh of\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\n"Not a hobby," Kauss corrected gently.\r\n\r\nHis face began to waver and flow as the Mocker\'s had done. Then it\r\nsnapped back into place.\r\n\r\nHe licked his lips very delicately.\r\n\r\n"You see, I\'m a Stroller myself. And, somehow, I\'m feeling that I\'d\r\nlike to eat."\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
