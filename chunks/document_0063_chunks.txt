McClellan\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Imagination Stories of Science and Fantasy\r\n                             October 1954\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nRuskin leaned back and yawned--the porch chair creaked comfortably. It\r\nwas a comfortable day. Fifty yards away the barnyard was alive with\r\nSpring noises. Clean crisp smells floated to him through the bright\r\nmorning air.\r\n\r\nDaisy walked slowly up and watched him with big affectionate eyes.\r\nRuskin smiled down at her. She was a pretty one, pretty soft hair, deep\r\nblue eyes, lithe rounded lines.\r\n\r\n"Nice doggie."\r\n\r\nHe patted her head gently.\r\n\r\n"Nice doggie," he repeated.\r\n\r\nHolidays in the country came too seldom.\r\n\r\nThe quiet was wonderful.\r\n\r\nTom, the wrinkled little farmhand, opened the porch door.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Ruskin?

"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Tom."\r\n\r\n"Man here to see you."\r\n\r\n"Who?"\r\n\r\n"That digger fellow.

"\r\n\r\nRuskin frowned and swore quietly. Even his holidays were shattered by\r\npeople who couldn\'t forget he was Commissioner of Internal Security.\r\nAnd these people were always little unimportant ones, like this\r\narcheologist Bigelow, whose little fears suddenly became giant threats\r\nto national security.\r\n\r\n"Send him out here, Tom."\r\n\r\nTom turned back into the house. Ruskin could hear his gruff voice\r\ninside, and a few moments later Bigelow, stooped and bespectacled,\r\nemerged from the house.\r\n\r\nRuskin smiled weakly.\r\n\r\n"Hello, Bigelow."\r\n\r\n"Good morning, Commissioner."\r\n\r\nBigelow stood, clutching his briefcase, shaking with excitement. Then\r\nsuddenly his eyes fell on Daisy and something like fear passed over his\r\nface.\r\n\r\n"Sit down, Bigelow."\r\n\r\nBigelow balanced himself delicately on the edge of a porch chair, his\r\nbriefcase resting on his long bony knees. But his eyes remained fixed\r\non the dog.\r\n\r\n"Is this social or business, Bigelow?"\r\n\r\n"Sort of both, Commissioner," he answered slowly. Then added quickly,\r\n"But I wouldn\'t disturb your holiday if it wasn\'t important."\r\n\r\nRuskin nodded dully.\r\n\r\nThen several moments of silence during which Bigelow continued to watch\r\nDaisy carefully. Finally, since his visitor did not seem inclined to\r\nspeak, Ruskin asked simply, "Well?"\r\n\r\n"First tell the dog to go away."\r\n\r\n"Daisy?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"I won\'t say a word with _IT_ here."\r\n\r\nRuskin shrugged.\r\n\r\n"As you wish," he said. "Daisy ... go ... go on, like a good girl."\r\n\r\nDaisy\'s big eyes seemed hurt but, reluctantly, she walked away.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBigelow watched suspiciously after her until she was well out of\r\nhearing.\r\n\r\n"Now," he began, "a week ago we started digging around the crater on\r\nthe East Coast where some great pre-Atomic cities once stood...."\r\n\r\nBigelow paused excitedly.\r\n\r\nRuskin sighed. It was much too nice a day....\r\n\r\n"... and there we came upon THREE pre-Atomic books!"\r\n\r\nBigelow paused again.\r\n\r\n"A wonderful find," Ruskin said, without enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n"More wonderful than you think, Commissioner."\r\n\r\nBigelow squared his shoulders dramatically.\r\n\r\n"Two of them were much like the other pre-Atomic books in the museums,\r\nbut the third...."\r\n\r\nBigelow was bursting with excitement.\r\n\r\n"... the third had pictures in it!"\r\n\r\nRuskin straightened up.\r\n\r\n"Amazing!"\r\n\r\nNever before had a pre-Atomic book been found with pictures. Artists\r\nhad painted their own versions drawn from the few meager written\r\ndescriptions....\r\n\r\n"How many pictures, Bigelow?"\r\n\r\n"Plenty, but just one would be enough to shake the foundations of our\r\nsocial world!"\r\n\r\nHe opened his briefcase and pulled out a small book protected by its\r\nown cloth cover. He opened to a marked page.\r\n\r\n"Just take a look at this!"\r\n\r\nRuskin took the book and stared curiously at a picture showing a\r\ndressed up dog sitting in a chair patting a human on the head. The\r\ncaption read: MAN\'S BEST FRIEND GETS REWARD.\r\n\r\nRuskin glanced back at Bigelow.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t understand," he said slowly. "Is it some kind of joke-book?"\r\n\r\nBigelow grinned narrowly.\r\n\r\n"A very bitter joke, Commissioner. A joke of Mother Nature\'s."\r\n\r\n"I\'m still not sure I understand...."\r\n\r\n"I think you do, Commissioner," Bigelow countered quickly. "Now so many\r\nof the things we couldn\'t understand become clear to us. The naked\r\nanimal on the floor in the picture is our ancestor, and the hairless\r\nthing in the chair is our dog!"\r\n\r\nRuskin shook his head.\r\n\r\n"Impossible!

"\r\n\r\n"Not at all! In the lower animal and plant orders more amazing\r\nmutations occurred during the Atomic Wars--we just never noticed\r\nbecause they didn\'t touch us closely."\r\n\r\nRuskin\'s mind rushed over the implications, all the frightful and\r\ncarefully ignored aberrations of the Atomic blasts.\r\n\r\nIf it was true, and he still wouldn\'t let himself be convinced, it\r\nwould be a tremendous blow to the morale of Society. And it was his\r\nduty to protect the well-being of Society. He must decide ... now ...\r\nfor Society....\r\n\r\n"This is a very delicate problem, Bigelow," he said finally.\r\n\r\n"I know, Commissioner."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve come upon something ... fantastic."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Commissioner."\r\n\r\n"We must handle this very carefully."\r\n\r\n"I understand."\r\n\r\n"Good. Leave the book with me ... for security reasons ... and I\'ll\r\nfigure how to handle it."\r\n\r\n"Well...."\r\n\r\n"Of course, I\'ll see that you get all the credit you deserve."\r\n\r\nBigelow rose.\r\n\r\n"Very well, Commissioner. I\'ll leave it in your hands."\r\n\r\nHe left with the air of a man just conquering the world.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRuskin sat, the closed book in both hands, for a long long while. It\r\nwas very late when he called the Psycho Section.\r\n\r\n"Yes," Psycho answered. "We have a file on Bigelow."\r\n\r\n"Have you ever interned him?"\r\n\r\n"No. But he\'s catalogued as extremely unstable."\r\n\r\n"Fine. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Thank you."\r\n\r\nRuskin placed the receiver carefully back on the cradle. Nothing to\r\nfear from Bigelow. He rose and walked slowly toward the fire.\r\n\r\nHe looked down at the book.\r\n\r\nWar! War! War! From the beginning of man almost to his own destruction.\r\n\r\nSince the Atomic Wars Earth had been comparatively peaceful--because,\r\npeople thought, Man had become surfeited of war.\r\n\r\nRuskin frowned.\r\n\r\nAttitudes, someone had once said, are more important than facts.\r\n\r\nHe dropped the book into the flames.\r\n\r\nVery well, then.\r\n\r\nLet Earth be happy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDaisy walked slowly over to him and barked quietly. The pretty golden\r\nhair hung gently over her shoulders, and her blue eyes were very soft.\r\n\r\nRuskin patted her gently.\r\n\r\n"Nice doggie," he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
