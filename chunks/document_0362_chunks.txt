W. Hall\r\n\r\n\r\n    "The face of the giant was indeed that of a god...."\r\n\r\n\r\nOn that summer day the sky over New York was unflecked by clouds, and\r\nthe air hung motionless, the waves of heat undisturbed. The city was a\r\nvast oven where even the sounds of the coiling traffic in its streets\r\nseemed heavy and weary under the press of heat that poured down from\r\nabove. In Washington Square, the urchins of the neighborhood splashed in\r\nthe fountain, and the usual midday assortment of mothers, tramps and\r\nout-of-works lounged listlessly on the hot park benches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _All gazed, transfixed, at the vast form that towered\r\nabove them._]\r\n\r\nAs a bowl, the Square was filled by the torrid sun, and the trees and\r\ngrass drooped like the people on its walks. In the surrounding city, men\r\nworked in sweltering offices and the streets rumbled with the\r\nnever-ceasing tide of business--but Washington Square rested.\r\n\r\nAnd then a man walked out of one of the houses lining the square, and\r\nall this was changed.\r\n\r\nHe came with a calm, steady stride down the steps of a house on the\r\nnorth side, and those who happened to see him gazed with surprised\r\ninterest. For he was a giant in size. He measured at least eleven feet\r\nin height, and his body was well-formed and in perfect proportion. He\r\ncrossed the street and stepped over the railing into the nearest patch\r\nof grass, and there stood with arms folded and legs a little apart. The\r\nexpression on his face was preoccupied and strangely apart, nor did it\r\nchange when, almost immediately from the park bench nearest him, a\r\nwoman\'s excited voice cried:\r\n\r\n"Look! Look! 

=== Chunk 2 ===
Oh, look!"\r\n\r\nThe people around her craned their necks and stared, and from them grew\r\na startled murmur. Others from farther away came to see who had cried\r\nout, and remained to gaze fascinated at the man on the grass. Quickly\r\nthe murmur spread across the Square, and from its every part men and\r\nwomen and children streamed towards the center of interest--and then,\r\nwhen they saw, backed away slowly and fearfully, with staring eyes, from\r\nwhere the lone figure stood.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was about that figure something uncanny and terrible. There, in\r\nthe hot midday hush, something was happening to it which men would say\r\ncould not happen; and men, seeing it, backed away in alarm. Quickly they\r\ndispersed. Soon there were only white, frightened faces peering from\r\nbehind buildings and trees.\r\n\r\nBefore their very eyes the giant was growing.\r\n\r\nWhen he had first emerged, he had been around eleven feet tall, and now,\r\nwithin three minutes, he had risen close to sixteen feet.\r\n\r\nHis great body maintained its perfect proportions. It was that of an\r\nelderly man clad simply in a gray business suit. The face was kind, its\r\nclear-chiselled features indicating fine spiritual strength; on the\r\nwhite forehead beneath the sparse gray hair were deep-sunken lines which\r\nspoke of years of concentrated work.\r\n\r\nNo thought of malevolence could come from that head with its gentle blue\r\neyes that showed the peace within, but fear struck ever stronger into\r\nthose who watched him, and in one place a woman fainted; for the great\r\nbody continued to grow, and grow ever faster, until it was twenty feet\r\nhigh, then swiftly twenty-five, and the feet, still separated, were as\r\nlong as the body of a normal boy. Clothes and body grew effortlessly,\r\nthe latter apparently without pain, as if the terrifying process were\r\nwholly natural.\r\n\r\nThe cars coming into Washington Square had stopped as their drivers\r\nsighted what was rising there, and by now the bordering streets were\r\ntangled with traffic. A distant crowd of milling people heightened the\r\nturmoil. The northern edge was deserted, but in a large semicircle was\r\nspread a fear-struck, panicky mob. A single policeman, his face white\r\nand his eyes wide, tried to straighten out the tangle of vehicles, but\r\nit was infinitely beyond him and he sent in a riot call; and as the\r\ngiant with the kind, dignified face loomed silently higher than the\r\ntrees in the Square, and ever higher, a dozen blue-coated figures\r\nappeared, and saw, and knew fear too, and hung back awe-stricken, at a\r\nloss what to do. For by now the rapidly mounting body had risen to the\r\nheight of forty feet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn excited voice raised itself above the general hubbub.\r\n\r\n"Why, I know him! I know him! It\'s Edgar Wesley! Doctor Edgar Wesley!"\r\n\r\nA police sergeant turned to the man who had spoken.\r\n\r\n"And it--he knows you? Then go closer to him, and--and--ask him what it\r\nmeans."\r\n\r\nBut the man looked fearfully at the giant and hung back. Even as they\r\ntalked, his gigantic body had grown as high as the four-storied\r\nbuildings lining the Square, and his feet were becoming too large for\r\nthe place where they had first been put. And now a faint smile could be\r\nseen on the giant\'s face, an enigmatic smile, with something ironic and\r\nbitter in it.\r\n\r\n"Then shout to him from here," pressed the sergeant nervously. "We\'ve\r\ngot to find out something! This is crazy--impossible! My God! Higher\r\nyet--and faster!"\r\n\r\nSummoning his courage, the other man cupped his hands about his mouth\r\nand shouted:\r\n\r\n"Dr. Wesley! Can you speak and tell us? 

=== Chunk 3 ===
Can we help you stop it?"\r\n\r\nThe ring of people looked up breathless at the towering figure, and a\r\nwave of fear passed over them and several hysterical shrieks rose up as,\r\nvery slowly, the huge head shook from side to side. But the smile on its\r\nlips became stronger, and kinder, and the bitterness seemed to leave it.\r\n\r\nThere was fear at that motion of the enormous head, but a roar of panic\r\nsounded from the watchers when, with marked caution, the growing giant\r\nmoved one foot from the grass into the street behind and the other into\r\nthe nearby base of Fifth Avenue, just above the Arch. Fearing harm,\r\nthey were gripped by terror, and they fought back while the trembling\r\npolicemen tried vainly to control them; but the panic soon ended when\r\nthey saw that the leviathan\'s arms remained crossed and his smile kinder\r\nyet. By now he dwarfed the houses, his body looming a hundred and fifty\r\nfeet into the sky. At this moment a woman back of the semicircle slumped\r\nto her knees and prayed hysterically.\r\n\r\n"Someone\'s coming out of his house!" shouted one of the closest\r\nonlookers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe door of the house from which the giant had first appeared had\r\nopened, and the figure of a middle-aged, normal-sized man emerged. For a\r\nsecond he crouched on the steps, gaping up at the monstrous shape in the\r\nsky, and then he scurried down and made at a desperate run for the\r\nnearest group of policemen.\r\n\r\nHe gripped the sergeant and cried frantically:\r\n\r\n"That\'s Dr. Wesley! 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Why don\'t you do something? Why don\'t--"\r\n\r\n"Who are you?" the officer asked, with some return of an authoritative\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n"I work for him. I\'m his janitor. But--can\'t you do anything? Look at\r\nhim! 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Look!"\r\n\r\nThe crowd pressed closer. "What do you know about this?" went on the\r\nsergeant.\r\n\r\nThe man gulped and stared around wildly. "He\'s been working on\r\nsomething--many years--I don\'t know what, for he kept it a close secret.\r\nAll I knew is that an hour ago I was in my room upstairs, when I heard\r\nsome disturbance in his laboratory, on the ground floor. I came down and\r\nknocked on the door, and he answered from inside and said that\r\neverything was all right--"\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t go in?"\r\n\r\n"No. I went back up, and everything was quiet for a long time. Then I\r\nheard a lot of noise down below--a smashing--as if things were being\r\nbroken. But I thought he was just destroying something he didn\'t need,\r\nand I didn\'t investigate: he hated to be disturbed. And then, a little\r\nlater, I heard them shouting out here in the Square, and I looked out\r\nand saw. I saw him--just as I knew him--but a giant! Look at his face!\r\nWhy, he has the face of--of a god! He\'s--as if he were looking down on\r\nus--and--pitying us...."\r\n\r\nFor a moment all were silent as they gazed, transfixed, at the vast form\r\nthat towered two hundred feet above them. Almost as awe-inspiring as the\r\nastounding growth was the fine, dignified calmness of the face. The\r\nsergeant broke in:\r\n\r\n"The explanation of this must be in his laboratory. We\'ve got to have a\r\nlook. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
You lead us there."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe other man nodded; but just then the giant moved again, and they\r\nwaited and watched.\r\n\r\nWith the utmost caution the titanic shape changed position. Gradually,\r\none great foot, over thirty feet in length, soared up from the street\r\nand lowered farther away, and then the other distant foot changed its\r\nposition; and the leviathan came gently to rest against the tallest\r\nbuilding bordering the Square, and once more folded his arms and stood\r\nquiet. The enormous body appeared to waver slightly as a breath of wind\r\nwashed against it: obviously it was not gaining weight as it grew.\r\nAlmost, now, it appeared to float in the air. Swiftly it grew another\r\ntwenty-five feet, and the gray expanse of its clothes shimmered\r\nstrangely as a ripple ran over its colossal bulk.\r\n\r\nA change of feeling came gradually over the watching multitude. The\r\nface of the giant was indeed that of a god in the noble, irony-tinged\r\nserenity of his calm features. It was if a further world had opened, and\r\none of divinity had stepped down; a further world of kindness and\r\nfellow-love, where were none of the discords that bring conflicts and\r\nslaughterings to the weary people of Earth. Spiritual peace radiated\r\nfrom the enormous face under the silvery hair, peace with an undertone\r\nof sadness, as if the giant knew of the sorrows of the swarm of dwarfs\r\nbeneath him, and pitied them.\r\n\r\nFrom all the roofs and the towers of the city, for miles and miles\r\naround, men saw the mammoth shape and the kindly smile grow more and\r\nmore tenuous against the clear blue sky. The figure remained quietly in\r\nthe same position, his feet filling two empty streets, and under the\r\nspell of his smile all fear seemed to leave the nearer watchers, and\r\nthey became more quiet and controlled.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe group of policemen and the janitor made a dash for the house from\r\nwhich the giant had come. They ascended the steps, went in, and found\r\nthe door of the laboratory locked. They broke the door down. The\r\nsergeant looked in.\r\n\r\n"Anyone in here?" he cried. Nothing disturbed the silence, and he\r\nentered, the others following.\r\n\r\nA long, wide, dimly-lit room met their eyes, and in its middle the\r\nremains of a great mass of apparatus that had dominated it.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus was now completely destroyed. Its dozen rows of tubes were\r\nshattered, its intricate coils of wire and machinery hopelessly smashed.\r\nFragments lay scattered all over the floor. No longer was there the\r\nleast shape of meaning to anything in the room; there remained merely a\r\nlitter of glass and stone and scrap metal.\r\n\r\nConspicuous on the floor was a large hammer. The sergeant walked over to\r\npick it up, but, instead, paused and stared at what lay beyond it.\r\n\r\n"A body!" he said.\r\n\r\nA sprawled out dead man lay on the floor, his dark face twisted up, his\r\nsightless eyes staring at the ceiling, his temple crushed as with a\r\nhammer. Clutched tight in one stiff hand was an automatic. On his chest\r\nwas a sheet of paper.\r\n\r\nThe captain reached down and grasped the paper. He read what was written\r\non it, and then he read it to the others:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    There was a fool who dreamed the high dream of the pure scientist,\r\n    and who lived only to ferret out the secrets of nature, and harness\r\n    them for his fellow men. He studied and worked and thought, and in\r\n    time came to concentrate on the manipulation of the atom, especially\r\n    the possibility of contracting and expanding it--a thing of greatest\r\n    potential value. For nine years he worked along this line, hoping to\r\n    succeed and give new power, new happiness, a new horizon to mankind.\r\n    Hermetically sealed in his laboratory, self-exiled from human\r\n    contacts, he labored hard.\r\n\r\n    There came a day when the device into which the fool had poured his\r\n    life stood completed and a success. And on that very day an agent\r\n    for a certain government entered his laboratory to steal the device.\r\n    And in that moment the fool realized what he had done: that, from\r\n    the apparatus he had invented, not happiness and new freedom would\r\n    come to his fellow men, but instead slaughter and carnage and\r\n    drunken power increased a hundredfold. He realized, suddenly, that\r\n    men had not yet learned to use fruitfully the precious, powerful\r\n    things given to them, but as yet could only play with them like\r\n    greedy children--and kill as they played. Already his invention had\r\n    brought death. And he realized--even on this day of his\r\n    triumph--that it and its secret must be destroyed, and with them he\r\n    who had fashioned so blindly.\r\n\r\n    For the scientist was old, his whole life was the invention, and\r\n    with its going there would be nothing more.\r\n\r\n    And so he used the device\'s great powers on his own body; and then,\r\n    with those powers working on him, he destroyed the device and all\r\n    the papers that held its secrets.\r\n\r\n    Was the fool also mad? Perhaps. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
But I do not think so. Into his\r\n    lonely laboratory, with this marauder, had come the wisdom that men\r\n    must wait, that the time is not yet for such power as he was about\r\n    to offer. A gesture, his strange death, which you who read this have\r\n    seen? Yes, but a useful one, for with it he and his invention and\r\n    its hurtful secrets go from you; and a fitting one, for he dies\r\n    through his achievement, through his very life.\r\n\r\n    But, in a better sense, he will not die, for the power of his\r\n    achievement will dissolve his very body among you infinitely; you\r\n    will breathe him in your air; and in you he will live incarnate\r\n    until that later time when another will give you the knowledge he\r\n    now destroys, and he will see it used as he wished it used.--E. W.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe sergeant\'s voice ceased, and wordlessly the men in the laboratory\r\nlooked at each other. No comment was needed. They went out.\r\n\r\nThey watched from the steps of Edgar Wesley\'s house. At first sight of\r\nthe figure in the sky, a new awe struck them, for now the shape of the\r\ngiant towered a full five hundred feet into the sun, and it seemed\r\nalmost a mirage, for definite outline was gone from it. It shimmered and\r\nwavered against the bright blue like a mist, and the blue shone through\r\nit, for it was quite transparent. And yet still they imagined they could\r\ndiscern the slight ironic smile on the face, and the peaceful,\r\nunderstanding light in the serene eyes; and their hearts swelled at the\r\nknowledge of the spirit, of the courage, of the fine, far-seeing mind\r\nof that outflung titanic martyr to the happiness of men.\r\n\r\nThe end came quickly. The great misty body rose; it floated over the\r\ncity like a wraith, and then it swiftly dispersed, even as steam\r\ndissolves in the air. They felt a silence over the thousands of watching\r\npeople in the Square, a hush broken at last by a deep, low murmur of awe\r\nand wonderment as the final misty fragments of the vast sky-held figure\r\nwavered and melted imperceptibly--melted and were gone from sight in the\r\nair that was breathed by the men whom Edgar Wesley loved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Astounding Stories_ November 1932.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.
