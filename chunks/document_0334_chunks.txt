]\r\n\r\n\r\nHis name was Hrlec Brey. He was a big man, and he moved slowly as if he\r\nhad all the time in the world.\r\n\r\nAnd he had. 

=== Chunk 3 ===
He had all the time--years and years behind him, years and\r\nyears ahead. And the world was his, its length and breadth, its skies\r\nand seas, the solitude of night, the loneliness of day.\r\n\r\nHe was eating dinner when the knowledge smashed across his mind:\r\n_Tonight I am going to die._\r\n\r\nHe put down his leg of _ayala_ and stared blankly at the plank\r\nwall across the room. That he was going to die did not disturb him.\r\nThat he knew about it did. It was not whimsy that had crossed his\r\nmind. He was not given to idle speculation. It was as if a sense of\r\nprecognition had suddenly developed in his intellect. It was a strange,\r\nirrevocable certainty.\r\n\r\nHis gaze fell on the half-eaten leg of _ayala_, and he shrugged. A\r\ncrime to let it go to waste, impending death or not. He picked it up,\r\nmoved his jaw slowly around the bone. So I\'m going to die. Tomorrow\r\nI\'ll be free. Then his eyes hardened and his teeth tore savagely at the\r\nlast bite of meat. _I haven\'t evolved._\r\n\r\nMoving slowly because the pains had been with him all day--he called\r\nthem "pains" because there seemed no better word--he washed off the\r\ntable and went out to the front porch of his small farmhouse on\r\nOphiuchus VI to sit in the twilight and smoke his pipe. He was a man of\r\nfifty Earth years, whom age had weathered and work had bent, and the\r\nstrongest thing about him was his will. He had willed to remain sane in\r\nhis solitary world after the tragedy so many years before, and he had\r\nmade it. Just made it. He did not even talk to himself.\r\n\r\nHe settled his bones in the log chair and planted his feet comfortably\r\non the railing. He had willed that he could gaze upon this evening\r\nscene and believe it to be Earth. Often he had succeeded. The same\r\ncolors in the twilight, though it lasted seven hours. A sky with a\r\nMilky Way, without a moon. Gravity that made him always just a little\r\ntired. Forests and mountains and sea, beauty and peace. And Sol, a\r\npinpoint two thousand light-years off, with no chance of ever getting\r\nback.\r\n\r\nA living hell.\r\n\r\nHe lit his pipe, filled with a native weed he\'d gotten used to. There\r\nwas no savor in a pipeful now, with bitterness eating at him. How could\r\nhe spend his last night? There was only one way. The same as any other\r\nof the thousand nights before.\r\n\r\nWhen he died, the last of his race would disappear from the face of\r\nAsmarad, sixth planet of the sun Ophiuchus. He was of Earth. Oh, Mother\r\nof Comforts, Earth, in the New Galactic Age! It was a long way from the\r\nbarbarian Old Atomic, almost at the fringe of prehistory. As always,\r\nwhen he remembered his heritage from the distant home that had given\r\nhim birth, his great bowed shoulders straightened and some of the old\r\nfire came back into his eyes.\r\n\r\nThough he did not often allow himself to think of the past, his\r\nthoughts went back--how many years ago, Earth time?--to the day of\r\ntriumph, when Brey\'s ship had put down a mile away by the shore of a\r\nsalt sea. A thousand men and women with the purpose of carving out\r\nfrom untrodden paths the beginnings of a mighty civilization. To make\r\na little Earth of Asmarad as had been done on a thousand other worlds\r\nacross the galaxy--and perhaps by now, beyond.\r\n\r\nA thousand other worlds--and here they had failed. No, they had not\r\nquite failed. 

=== Chunk 4 ===
Not yet. Not with Brey alive. Not tonight. Tomorrow.\r\n\r\nSuddenly restless, he rose painfully and walked down the gravel path to\r\nhis flower garden. He gazed at the brilliant multicolored web-things\r\nnative to the region, but the sight for once gave him no pleasure. The\r\nrestlessness grew stronger. It became an urgency, at once compelling\r\nand disturbing. Urgency to do something before he died. 

=== Chunk 5 ===
Something\r\nas important as drawing his next breath. Yet what could possibly be\r\nimportant to Hrlec Brey, landbound Senior Captain of the Space Fleet,\r\nthe only Earthman left on Asmarad, on the evening of his death?\r\n\r\nHe looked from the flower garden across the plowed fields of his farm\r\nand then beyond, into the broad valley that ended against the blue haze\r\nof mountains a hundred miles away. For years the shimmering blue haze\r\nhad symbolized the impassable wall between him and Earth. He was hemmed\r\nin, without machinery to transport himself, without weapons except for\r\na bow and arrow he had made himself.\r\n\r\nHe heard, far away, two _trocoids_ thrashing aimlessly\r\namong the trees, their shrill staccato a lonely yet comforting\r\nsound. The animals, too, were almost like Earth animals. They\r\nreproduced by fission, like some of the lower forms of life on\r\nEarth. The _trocoid_ was like an oversized wasp. The murderous\r\n_ithycyphos_ was like a razorback horse, with a cry like a woman\r\nunder torture. The meat-rich _ayala_ made him think of landbound\r\nseals. There were other animals, too, other birds, and fish in the\r\nnearby sea.\r\n\r\nStill the urgency beat at him and, without quite knowing why, he began\r\nto walk across the plowed field to the enclosure where he kept a few\r\n_ayala_ to fatten. My animals might be gone, he thought anxiously,\r\nmy supply of meat might fail. _Hurry!_ his mind told him.\r\n_Hurry, hurry!_ His steps quickened.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow the long twilight deepened and night drifted slowly in from the\r\nfar blue haze. Always when the slow night of Asmarad began to fall,\r\nBrey felt anew the soul-wrenching loneliness. This was a twilight made\r\nfor the old pleasures that over the centuries had never changed. For\r\ngathering by the campfire and singing the old songs, for the spice of\r\nwell-cooked meat, for whispers in the dark and strolls through the\r\nforest, for a woman\'s lips on yours. And back on Earth, under the\r\nshadows of the spaceships ready to hurtle the light-years across the\r\ngalaxy, there was laughter on the lips of man, and their hearts held\r\nroom for love.\r\n\r\nWith aching heart he remembered Ansa. A wisp of a girl she had been,\r\nand the first of the women to die--only a month after their landing.\r\nHow long would they have been married now, had she lived? In this\r\ntimeless world, it was his one regret that he could never know exactly.\r\nHe could never celebrate their would-have-been anniversary. The day was\r\ndifferent in length, as were the years. And he had no watch to keep\r\ntrack of the hours. He could never count the years she had been gone.\r\nBut he knew they were many. Oh, how well he knew!\r\n\r\nHe began to walk faster, and then he began to trot, and then he broke\r\ninto an urgent, lumbering run, stumbling across the even furrows of the\r\npotato-like _terna_ he had planted.\r\n\r\nAnd then an internal grinding shock of terrible power slammed him to\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nHe was not knocked unconscious, but lay on his face on the rich red\r\ndirt, his mind shocked into stupor. At length he shook his head, pushed\r\nheavily up with his hands and climbed to shaky feet. He leaned against\r\nthe logs of the enclosure, gathering strength. The pains were stronger\r\nnow, the periodic nameless writhings inside him. Terror touched his\r\nmind, not at the pains themselves but at their pattern, over the\r\nmonths. Pain that was not quite pain, sensations without an Earth name.\r\nThey had bothered him now and then, though lately they had come more\r\noften. And this was the most terrible of all.\r\n\r\nWhat\'s been happening inside me all this time? Must be a disease. A\r\nnative disease. And no doctors, no medicine left, no hospital. And no\r\npretty nurse to hold my hand!\r\n\r\nIt\'s beginning, he thought. Death.\r\n\r\nHe had seen much of death since coming to Asmarad. Too much. First he\r\nhad seen the babies born dead, the babies conceived on the way. No\r\nwoman ever became pregnant on Asmarad. Nobody ever knew why. And then\r\nhe had seen all the women die. Sudden deaths, painless and unexplained.\r\nThe doctors could only suggest that the female physiology, complex and\r\ndelicate as it was, could not adapt even to the slight changes on\r\nAsmarad. But the doctors never really knew.\r\n\r\nTheir purpose on Asmarad defeated, the men planned to return to Earth.\r\nAnd then Brey had seen the atomic explosion that had wrecked the ship\r\nand the entire community, killing them all. All but Brey.\r\n\r\nAnd no ship was due from Earth for a hundred years.\r\n\r\nMy own death, Brey thought dully, wiping sweat from his face, will be\r\ndifferent. Not silent and painless and mercifully quick.\r\n\r\nHe heard screaming in the distance and his blood chilled. 

=== Chunk 6 ===
The\r\n_ithycyphos_ were near. Perhaps they would approach his farm. 

=== Chunk 7 ===
He\r\nwould be ready if they did. Feeling stronger now, he walked to the gate\r\nto enter the enclosure.\r\n\r\nThe gate was open.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt first shock caught his breath, but upon examining the gate, he saw\r\nthe latch had broken. He looked sharply into the enclosure for his six\r\n_ayala_. He counted only five. One had wandered off. No--there,\r\nfar inside the enclosure, two intermediate-sized _ayala_,\r\nfissioned from the body of the other adult, were flopping about in the\r\ntall grass.\r\n\r\nHe grunted with satisfaction. If the others had wandered off, it would\r\nbe days before he could find them, or catch others. He whistled and the\r\nfive adults shambled over on nimble fins. He knew he must slaughter\r\nsome of them. He picked the three fattest.\r\n\r\nWhat instinct led me over here? How could I possibly have known my meat\r\nsupply might be lost?\r\n\r\nFollowed by the docile _ayala_, he hurried back to his farmhouse,\r\nherded them inside and closed the door. His bow and arrow would be a\r\nmatch for the _ithycyphos_, but some instinct told him he needed\r\neven more protection. From the adjacent woodshed he got tools and\r\nlengths of stout planking and spent half an hour carefully barricading\r\nthe windows. I\'ve never done that in years. Why now, when I\'m going to\r\ndie?\r\n\r\nFinished nailing crisscross planking to the two windows, he tested\r\nthe barricade thoroughly for strength. Satisfied, he slaughtered the\r\n_ayala_, cut up their meat and packed it in the brine vat. (Enough\r\nfor a month. But why did I slaughter them now? And why three? Why not\r\nmore? 

=== Chunk 8 ===
Or less?)\r\n\r\nThe screaming sounded again, still far across the valley. He knew he\r\nmust lay in more food. He had meat now, but his stock of _terna_\r\nwas low. There were five hours of twilight left, time enough to fill\r\nhis bin.\r\n\r\nHe was busy for three hours digging _terna_, though three times\r\nmore he was knocked flat by the terrible shocks, and the pains were\r\nwith him all the time. His hands had begun to shake, and his eyes would\r\nblur and dim and he would have to rest a moment before he could see\r\nclearly again. He had begun to feel weaker. He knew the end was not far\r\noff.\r\n\r\nAs he worked, his mind wandered back again to his years with the Space\r\nFleet, to the other planets he\'d seen where Earthmen had been able to\r\nevolve. An old word, evolution, but in the New Galactic Age, a new\r\nmeaning. On Earth it had taken a billion years for the human body to\r\nevolve into that of an intelligent biped. Now, on some of the more\r\nalien planets which imposed severe conditions on the preservation\r\nof human life, it took surprisingly less time to evolve in order to\r\nmeet these conditions. An adaptability existed in the genes that had\r\nnot been known before. Until it was discovered, colonization had\r\nbeen restricted to a handful of planets whose conditions were nearly\r\nidentical to Earth\'s.\r\n\r\nBut the discovery of the faculty of adaptable evolution had opened\r\na thousand worlds to Earthmen. It took centuries on some planets to\r\nevolve, slowly and painfully and with suitable protective measures,\r\nonly decades on others. It made Brey proud. Proud that the human body\r\nwas capable of so much. Proud that the inheritors of the galaxy were\r\nnot the _lilithae_ from the Ridge nor the degenerated mutations\r\nfrom the Hercules cluster, but Earthmen.\r\n\r\nLike those Earthmen on Thor of Beta Centaurus whose lungs had evolved\r\nfor breathing a methane atmosphere. Like those on Remus of Sirius whose\r\nlobster-like bodies had evolved to withstand temperatures which reached\r\nsix hundred. Like those on Betelguese XXX, too far out from its sun for\r\nheat and light, whose eyes had atrophied over the generations and now\r\nwere removed like appendices used to be removed on Earth, and whose\r\nperceptions had evolved to meet the new conditions. Or on Jpidr of the\r\nsun Deneb Algedi, where Earthmen\'s digestive systems had evolved to\r\neating the metallic lichens adhering to rocks, the only native form of\r\nlife. There were a billion Earthmen now on barren Jpidr.\r\n\r\nAnd only one on Asmarad....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhy didn\'t we evolve before we died? But even if we could, it would\r\nhave been too late. 

=== Chunk 9 ===
There were no women. Without a woman, his race must\r\nperish.\r\n\r\nHe finished putting up his supplies, and went back to the front porch\r\nto wait for the death that stalked him. He relit his pipe, his mind\r\nrefreshed, the sense of urgency almost gone. But suddenly fires seared\r\nhis body and he slumped back in his chair until the racking spasm\r\npassed.\r\n\r\nWings whirred past the porch and the screech of a _trocoid_ beat\r\nat his ears. He watched the furry creature land at the base of a tree\r\nin front of his farmhouse. It waddled awkwardly toward a hole Brey had\r\nnot noticed before, dragging in its creepers a length of floccose weed,\r\nits staple diet. The bird must have been boring out the hole the past\r\nseveral days. As Brey watched, the bird began to close the hole in the\r\ntree from inside, with chunks of bark and dirt and moss, cemented with\r\nsecretion.\r\n\r\nNow it was black night at last and the _trocoid_ was for the\r\nmoment silent inside its tree and Brey felt the wall of silence\r\npressing in upon him.\r\n\r\n_Ansa_, he thought dimly. _If only we had died together...._\r\n\r\nNew shocks erupted inside his body and a scream tore from his throat.\r\nA new urgency made him scramble inside the farmhouse where he just had\r\ntime to close the door and slip planks into stays made for that purpose\r\nbefore he fell writhing to the floor.\r\n\r\nThere came a moment of peace between the shocks. _I was thinking\r\nof Ansa when it struck. Ansa? My wife. Funny, I can\'t seem to think.\r\nMust be in a daze. I remember Ansa, all right. What was Ansa, anyhow?\r\nI know. A woman. They look like Earthmen. Bipeds. I think they have\r\nintellects. Must be non-human. Like the lilithae._\r\n\r\nFrom the tree outside he heard the _trocoid\'s_ muffled\r\nscreeches. He knew it was the standard routine of the asexual bird\r\nfor fissioning--when an old _trocoid\'s_ instinct told it\r\nthat it was about to die, it found a breeding place safe from the\r\n_ithycyphos_, supplied it with food, barricaded itself inside,\r\nand then fissioned into two nearly-grown, mindless _trocoids_.\r\nThe food and the protection afforded by their parent would keep the\r\n_trocoids_ alive till instinct took hold and they could break free\r\ninto the world outside.\r\n\r\nBrey forgot about the _trocoid_ as his neck suddenly snapped\r\nand it became impossible to breathe, and he felt his body being rent\r\nasunder, as if something were trying to tear its way out of him.\r\n\r\nAnd before he died, he had one bitter, final thought: _I deserve to\r\ndie. On Asmarad, we never evolved._\r\n\r\nAnd after he died, the two naked humanoid creatures sprang to their\r\nfeet to stare mindlessly at one another.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n
